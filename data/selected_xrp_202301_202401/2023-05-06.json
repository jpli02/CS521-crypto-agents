Now, Google is taking a step forward with Solana (SOL). Google is not allowing Web 3.0 startups to use its Google Cloud platform. For instance, developers can set up Solana (SOL) validators on Google Cloud. Now, Google has also opened up a wealth of resources for Solana (SOL) ecosystem developers. These resources include free Google Workspace Business Plus, unlimited access to customer support, access to Google Cloud events at web3 conferences, etc."

Amid this win, it also announced the launching of an international exchange offering Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) perpetual futures leaving people confused. However, one of Ripple\u2019s board members has hinted at what could be the next move of Coinbase.\n\nAlso Read: Coinbase Legal Head Meets Ripple Chief Legal Officer\n\nadvertisement\n\nCoinbase Moving Ahead Of Being Just A Crypto Exchange\n\nAsheesh Birla, Board Member at Ripple commented on the recent actions taken by the Coinbase lately. He stated that Coinbase is transitioning from a crypto exchange to a crypto enabled banking service.\n\nBirla mentioned that Coinbase has updated its mission in order to build a crypto economy that will be a more fair, efficient, accessible, and transparent financial system for digital assets. However, Coinbase in a blog stated that it is dedicated to partnering with high bar regulators across US and Non US jurisdictions in order to update the financials system.

As per the data, its revenue on deposits via interest income, custodial fees and blockchain rewards are now making a huge part of its revenues. Birla mentioned that interest generated on the USDC deposits is alone generating $199 million which is 18% of all the Coinbase\u2019s revenue.\n\nThis directly depicts that Coinbase revenues are now shifting from consumer to high margin institutional customers. Its institutional trading revenue has increased by 67% over the last quarter. Ripple board member added that the U.S. biggest crypto exchange is benefiting from banking like revenues that are less dependent on the crypto market."

        "title": "Ripple CEO issues a message to XRP supporters - here's what he said - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Despite the ongoing legal battle with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has taken a moment to express his gratitude for the support shown by the XRP community.\n\nAmid the case\u2019s proceedings, there have been numerous challenges and developments between both parties, and the community\u2019s support has not gone unnoticed by the Ripple leadership.\n\nIn this line, following his participation in the XRP Las Vegas 2023 meeting, Garlinghouse remarked on the community\u2019s camaraderie while stating that \u201cI can\u2019t adequately express my gratitude,\u201d he said in a tweet on May 6.\n\nGreat to meet so many folks from the XRP community at #XRPLasVegas2023 \u2013 the camaraderie is remarkable (and an amazing feeling in person vs Twitter!) This community has stood by and supported Team Ripple as we have fought the good fight\u2026I can\u2019t adequately express my gratitude pic.twitter.com/lb9TCURv3C \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 6, 2023\n\nThe XRP Las Vegas 2023 event, presented by Digital Perspective founder Bradley Kimes, is a two-day conference exclusively dedicated to members of the XRP community. The event has been dubbed the \u201cXRPArmy Conference of a lifetime!\u201d by its organizers, who hope it will become the XRP community\u2019s equivalent to the popular \u201cBitcoin Miami\u201d conference.\n\nAwaiting the summary judgment\n\nThe XRP and broader cryptocurrency communities are eagerly awaiting the summary judgment in the legal case. Garlinghouse, who anticipates the matter to be concluded in the first half of 2023, has previously expressed confidence that Ripple will emerge victorious.\n\nIn the latest update, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has claimed that the SEC\u2019s case against Ripple was weakened by recent developments, including a legal document referenced as \u201cECF 640,\u201d which acknowledges that the purchase of XRP was an investment of money into a common enterprise.\n\nDeaton also criticized the SEC\u2019s argument, stating that it potentially captures all future sales, even in countries that may recognize XRP as a fiat currency, which could be seen as a sign of overreach. These developments could have implications for the outcome of the legal case and the broader regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.\n\nSEC\u2019s expert dropped\n\nAhead of the summary judgment, Ripple recently revealed that one of the SEC\u2019s expert opinions on the \u201creasonable expectations of XRP purchasers\u201d was stricken from the court record, along with another SEC expert opinion on determining the cause of XRP price changes.\n\nNotably, the company has blasted the regulator for enforcing regulatory action without providing clear rules for crypto players in the United States. However, Ripple is banking on friendly global regulations to expand its business despite the situation in the U.S.\n\nTo provide context, in December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple and two of its executives, alleging that they had offered unregistered securities in the form of XRP.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s lack of clarity on what it considers security has been a point of contention, with many industry insiders hoping that the Ripple case will provide much-needed clarity. Despite repeated inquiries, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has yet to give a definitive answer, including on the status of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn the meantime, as the case awaits a conclusion, XRP continues to trade in tandem with the general. By press time, the token was trading at $0.46 with daily gains of about 0.65%."

        "content": "Never before have gold and silver traders had the luxury of a blockchain dedicated to making life in the bullion market easier. Sparklo (SPRK) is a bullion trading network with exceptionally high liquidity, low costs, and a seamless trading experience. Ripple (XRP)\u2019s long-running battle with the SEC enters its third year. Many experts believe the case will be closed this year as the court nears final verdict. Ripple\u2019s case could affect how cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are classified under new regulations. Ripple (XRP) \u2018s has already started to rally considerably since March.\n\nSparklo (SPRK) high-end NFTs to shake up bullion industry\n\nSparklo was born out of the need for bullion traders. The frustrations of low liquidity and high fees that have always plagued them are something Sparklo was designed to Solve. Sparklo uses the latest blockchain technology combined with fractionalized NFTs to smoothen the process of investing in gold.\n\nSparklo opens up global markets to its users \u2013 it allows them to actively participate in any online gold market worldwide. Sparklo users in China, for instance, would have no issue trading in gold markets in Uganda thanks to Sparklo\u2019s exceptional network services. Not only would such traders enjoy global access, but they would also enjoy high-speed transactions meaning trades would be completed promptly, ensuring that users take full advantage of price differences.\n\nSpeaking of price, Sparklo\u2019s users would enjoy a wide variety of prices from around the world.

Ripple (XRP) has denied the accusation, claiming that its token (XRP) is not a security.\n\nAs reports emerged that the case was planning to reach a final verdict, it stirred the Ripple (XRP) community, and that effect was noticed in Ripple (XRP)\u2019s late March market performance.\n\nRipple (XRP)\u2019s lawsuit is crucial to the industry because it would help define some of the expected regulations in a few years. For example, if Ripple (XRP) is deemed a security, it could mean Ethereum would also be deemed a security.\n\nFollowing the trending news of Ripple (XRP)\u2019s court case, XRP jumped from $0.38 to $0.46 in the 3rd week of March. It then jumped to $0.57 and stayed in that price range for a few weeks before dropping back to $0.4.\n\nInterestingly, Ripple (XRP) was on a bearish run until that late March rally and has been bullish since. So it would be interesting to see how the price performance as the case \u201chopefully\u201d comes to a close.\n\nFind out more about the Sparklo presale:\n\nWebsite: https://sparklo.finance\n\nPresale: https://invest.sparklo.finance\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparklo_finance\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/sparklofinance\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"
