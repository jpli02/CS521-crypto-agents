However, validators cannot vote on it at this time \u2014 indicating that mainnet deployment is still a ways off.\n\nAccording to information published in July of last year, developers introduced Hooks Builder, a web browser-based development environment that enables users to create XRPL smart contracts and deploy them on the Hooks testnet.\n\nDevelopers are also developing a sidechain for the XRP Ledger that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) concurrently.

Businesses and developers have a wide range of flexibility with the integration of smart contract functionalities.\n\nWith Hook, businesses and developers can allow auto-saving on incoming transactions, use \u201cLite Accounts\u201d without account reserves, track loyalty points for customers, automatically park VAT, etc.\n\nThe added functionality will drive more integrations by an existing business on XRPL and adoption by intending developers.

        "title": "Learning the extent of homelessness in Barrhead - Athabasca, Barrhead & Westlock News - Town and Country TODAY",
        "content": "Barrhead FCSS successful in getting the community in a 21 rural community survey being conducted by the Alberta Rural Development Network\n\nBARRHEAD - Homelessness is an issue in Barrhead.\n\nJust how much of a problem is something the Barrhead Community Family Support Services (FCSS) are hoping they will learn through a survey on rural homelessness.\n\nExecutive director Karen Gariepy said it is no secret that Barrhead has had a homelessness issue for some time, but the problem is that they do not know to what extent.\n\n\"We know there are homeless in the community,\" she said. \"People who are couch surfing, or in the warmer months, live in the valley, but we don't have a good picture of how many.\"\n\nGariepy said the survey will help FCSS and other community agencies identify to what extent homelessness is in the community and how many individuals are in danger of becoming homeless.\n\n\"Just how many people are one or two paycheques away from being homeless?\" she said. \"We need data, and hopefully, this will give us the information we need to go ahead with programming and determining what services we need here in Barrhead.\"\n\nGariepy said the information will also provide FCSS and other community organizations with statistics when approaching the province and the federal governments as well as private organizations for grant funding.\n\nThe survey is part of a larger project by the Alberta Rural Development Network (ARDN) to determine the extent of homelessness in 21 rural communities across the province.\n\nThe ARDN is a not-profit-organization created in 2009 by a partnership of the province's 21 public post-secondary institutions. Its mandate is to support rural sustainability through a wide variety of initiatives.\n\nGariepy said she learned about the project through the Family and Community Support Services Association of Alberta.\n\nBarrhead FCSS learned that ARDN had approved their application to be one of the communities included in the survey early this month.\n\nGariepy said FCSS staff are currently in the process of training their staff in the procedures to conduct the survey as well as contacting other organizations and community agencies who work with individuals who are homeless and at-risk populations.\n\nThe Ripple Connection Support Centre (RCSC) is one of the organizations Gariepy will be reaching out to.\n\nThe not-for-profit organization opened in 2010. It provides services for people who directly suffer from mental illness or brain injuries and their families and caregivers.\n\nRCSC executive director Tracy Whitten agreed with Gariepy, saying that homelessness has been an issue in Barrhead for some time.\n\n\"It is worse now than it's ever been and it seems it is getting worse month by month,\" she said. \"At one time, it was just individuals who were homeless, but now it\u2019s entire families.\"\n\nWhitten said that rising inflation, especially the cost of food and utilities, combined with the economy, the number of jobs that do not pay a living wage and the limited number of rental options have created the perfect storm for many individuals.\n\n\"It's impacting a lot of people, and there are individuals and, in some cases, as I said before, even families have been forced to live off the grid,\" she said. \"We have quite a few come in here. I would hate to hazard a guess on how many are homeless. A lot of couch surfing goes on or having several people crammed into one dwelling. It causes a lot of conflicts.\"\n\nShe also hopes the information they glean from the survey will help them or another organization start a much-needed homelessness shelter or emergency mat-type program in the community.\n\nThe latter is a project the RCSC has been working on ever since they were able to expand their space but have not been able to secure the necessary funding.\n\nHowever, in the meanwhile, Whitten said, RCSC will continue to provide people with a safe space to get out of the elements, have lunch, take a shower and launder their clothes.\n\nThe Ripple Connection Support Centre is open Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. For more information about their programming, call 780-674-5548 or their website www.rippleconnection.ca. They are also on Facebook.\n\nBarry Kerton, TownandCountryToday.com"
