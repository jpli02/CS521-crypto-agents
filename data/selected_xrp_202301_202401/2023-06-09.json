        "title": "Ripple CEO furious at SEC chief! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 09 Jun 2023 \u25aa 2 min of reading \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C.\n\nThe SEC has been on a witch hunt against crypto firms for several weeks now. It staunchly defends its position to clean up the American crypto industry and promote its growth. However, many players in this industry do not see the regulator\u2019s actions in the same light.\n\nThe SEC CEO: Between farce and hypocrisy?\n\nRecently, Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, officially filed lawsuits against the crypto platform Binance. This move provided an opportunity for him to publish a list of 61 cryptocurrencies that are considered unregistered securities.\n\nFollowing this, the SEC official expressed the underlying reasons for his regulatory policy. In a recent interview, Gary Gensler hinted that it is motivated by a desire to stimulate innovation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need more digital currencies,\u201d declared the SEC leader. These statements sparked outrage within the crypto community. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was particularly incensed by the financier\u2019s response.\n\nOn Twitter, the Ripple CEO didn\u2019t hesitate to point out the hypocrisy of such a statement, especially considering that just a few hours earlier, the SEC had added Binance to the list of crypto companies it is suing.\n\nGarlinghouse\u2019s remarks shed light on the perception of the crypto industry towards the SEC. Both the institution and its leader are despised by the crypto community. This trend is unlikely to change as long as they continue to be subjected to the inconsistent regulatory policies imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Ripple CEO attacks the SEC - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, has openly criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its approach to the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nIn a recent interview, Garlinghouse expressed his concerns about the SEC\u2019s legal actions against major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance, suggesting that it is merely a diversionary tactic.\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, downplays SEC recent attack on exchanges\n\nAccording to Garlinghouse, the SEC\u2019s recent legal actions are an attempt to deflect attention from its mismanagement of the FTX debacle.\n\nGarlinghouse believes the SEC is using these lawsuits as a smokescreen to distract attention from its own regulatory failures.\n\nGarlinghouse\u2019s criticism stems from his belief that the SEC\u2019s actions are hindering innovation in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nHe argues that the agency\u2019s approach is overly cautious and does not foster an environment conducive to technological advances.\n\nAs CEO of Ripple, a company that has faced its own legal battles with the SEC, Garlinghouse has every interest in promoting a regulatory landscape more conducive to innovation.\n\nThe Ripple CEO\u2019s comments highlight the ongoing tension between regulators and cryptocurrency companies.\n\nWhile some argue that stricter regulation is necessary to protect investors and maintain market stability, others, like Garlinghouse, believe that excessive regulation stifles innovation and inhibits growth.\n\nGarlinghouse is not alone in making accusations against the SEC\n\nGarlinghouse is not the only one criticizing the SEC. Many industry experts and cryptocurrency enthusiasts have expressed similar concerns about the agency\u2019s regulatory stance.\n\nThey argue that the SEC\u2019s approach is outdated and fails to capture the full potential of blockchain technology and digital assets.\n\nOne of the main issues raised by Garlinghouse and others is the lack of clarity in existing regulations.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s classification of cryptocurrencies as securities has been the subject of debate and confusion. This ambiguity creates uncertainty for companies operating in the cryptocurrency space, making it difficult for them to navigate the regulatory landscape.\n\nIn addition, Garlinghouse believes that the SEC\u2019s actions against exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance send a negative message to the broader cryptocurrency community.\n\nThese platforms are important players in the industry, and targeting them with legal actions undermines trust and creates a sense of fear and uncertainty.\n\nInstead of resorting to legal battles, Garlinghouse suggests that regulators should focus on engaging in meaningful dialogue with industry players.\n\nHe advocates a collaborative approach that allows for open discussion on how to strike the right balance between investor protection and innovation.\n\nAlthough Garlinghouse\u2019s criticism may be considered self-serving given Ripple\u2019s legal problems with the SEC, his concerns about overregulation and its impact on the industry are shared by many.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space is evolving rapidly, and it is critical that regulators keep pace with technological advances rather than stifling them.\n\nIt is worth noting that the SEC has a responsibility to protect investors and maintain market integrity.\n\nHowever, striking the right balance between regulation and innovation is a complex task.\n\nThe SEC should strive to develop clear and transparent guidelines that promote responsible innovation and foster the growth of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, Brad Garlinghouse\u2019s criticism of the SEC\u2019s legal actions against major exchanges reflects the ongoing tension between regulators and the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s actions may be intended to protect investors, they are seen by some as a diversionary tactic. Garlinghouse, along with others in the industry, believes that a more innovation-friendly regulatory approach is needed to promote growth and ensure the long-term success of the crypto space.\n\nFinding the right balance between regulation and innovation remains a challenge, and an open dialogue between regulators and industry stakeholders is key to addressing these concerns and shaping the future of the cryptocurrency industry."

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nRipple blockchain is the true meaning of tenacity and resilience. Despite a rough two years with the US SEC, the cross-border network seems almost out of the woods.\n\nIn a month when Bitcoin and Ethereum are losing their spark, Ripple\u2019s $XRP has been the shining beacon and pumped over 24% in the last 30 days.\n\nThis significant turn in fortune has driven many investors to ask if $XRP is still a good long-term investment.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto experts are also buying into another disruptive crypto project called DeeLance.\n\nXRP Posts Well Over 24% In Past Month \u2013 A Resurgence on the Horizon?\n\nThe crypto market is still reeling from growing regulatory scrutiny from the US government. So far, Binance and Coinbase have been added to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) legal blackbook.\n\nTrading volume has plunged and driven the market cap to the lower ends of $1 trillion.\n\nBitcoin has struggled to break above $27,000 for a week, but $XRP has continued its bullish breakout.\n\nAt press time, the $XRP token is trading at $0.53, indicating an uptrend of 1.83%. The asset\u2019s weekly performance is also in the green zone, with 5.23% growth experienced in the past seven days.\n\nHowever, the real interest lies in the $ XRP\u2019s monthly performance. The digital asset has posted 24.27% in the last 30 days, with the 90 days growth up by 44.09%.\n\nIts six months performance stands at 37.9%, with its year-to-date (YTD) up 57.27%.\n\nTurning to the technicals, $XRP is trading above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) indicator price of $0.47. The token\u2019s long-term 200-day SMA is also below the current price and stands at $0.42.\n\nTurning to other indicators, $XRP\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) is pushing toward the overbought region with an oscillator figure of 62.93. Also, its moving average convergence divergence (MACD) shows a strong buy signal.\n\n$XRP\u2019s swift pivot has been due to its ongoing legal tussle with the SEC, which is expected to conclude in the next couple of weeks.\n\nSo far, all indicators point to Ripple winning the case that $XRP is not a security. Recently, the US regulator has seen its request to seal the Hinman documents refused, indicating another court victory for the defendant.\n\nCourt victory for @Ripple as judge denies SEC motion to seal Hinman docs.

According to a tweet, Metaco can offer digital asset custodial services for about 80% of the banking sector, which is a huge figure.\n\nThis will enable $XRP to enjoy more extensive use cases.\n\nMassive Ripple via Metaco/ GFT Digital Asset Customers Metaco and GFT can offer digital assets custody solution to an estimated 80% of the banking sector Full list of Metaco GFT technology partners below #ripple #xrp #crypto #blockchain pic.twitter.com/h8Hq5SBU62 \u2014 The light shines in the darkness (@MatthewLINY) June 6, 2023\n\nNonetheless, a new crypto project, DeeLance, is also toeing the same path as the Ripple blockchain. This innovative project is looking to radicalize the freelance industry.\n\nDeeLance: Ripple\u2019s Disruptor Twin\n\nOutliers have been distinguished by their ability to alter an ancient system of doing things. This is what Ripple did with the SWIFT-controlled cross-border payment network.\n\nUsing blockchain technology, Ripple enabled anyone to send remittances to anywhere in the world at breakneck speed for a fraction of the cost.\n\nDeeLance is also changing the narrative by allowing freelancers to tap into a new smart way to work and earn.\n\nThe platform is a decentralized recruitment protocol that allows freelancers and employers to work seamlessly. One of its best features is that it is an all-encompassing blockchain protocol.\n\nHey DeeLancers!\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb#DeeLance Metaverse is all about socialize, work and earn!

This reduces the pilfering and use of their work without proper compensation.\n\nDeeLance also breaks the payment barrier like Ripple and makes it possible for freelancers to earn using crypto.\n\nThe platform is powered by an ERC-20 token called $DLANCE. The crypto asset is currently in presale and has raised over $1.3 million in the last couple of weeks.\n\nEarly-bird investors can buy DeeLance at its current presale value of $0.038 before the next price hike.\n\nBuy $DLANCE Now\n\nRelated News"
