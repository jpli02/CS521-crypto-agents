        "content": "The company also has locations on Executive Boulevard and Research Boulevard, not far from the new GE Aviation-Unison Industries home and Northrop Grumman in Beavercreek. The business also has locations in Virginia, Colorado and Michigan.\n\nIn all, the business has about 100,000 square feet in the Dayton area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s headquartered here,\u201d Resonant Sciences Chief Executive J. Micah North, a native of Chattanooga, Tenn., said of Beavercreek. \u201cWe started here.\u201d\n\nWe caught up with North, 46, co-founder of Resonant, to talk about where his company is and where it\u2019s going. This is an edited transcript of that interview, conducted as he offered a walk-through tour of his company\u2019s latest site at 4501 Indian Ripple Road, a former Vineyard Church youth center.\n\nDayton Daily News: Readers will want to know how much the Cerberus investment is.\n\nJ. Micah North: \u201cI can\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\nDDN: I had to ask.\n\nNorth: \u201cI know. It\u2019s fair. You can ask anything you want ... They (Cerberus) are really good people. They really understand the company. I\u2019ve known several of the folks there, gotten to know them well. Those guys are kind of a who\u2019s who. Gen. (John W. \u201cJay\u201d) Raymond (the first chief of space operations of the U.S. Space Force) is working for them, former Lockheed-Martin Skunk work guys, which is where I came from originally. A lot of just great Americans. People really, really focused on the defense of the country, and doing the right thing for the country. It\u2019s more than a money play for them.\u201d\n\nDDN: How did you get on their radar?\n\nNorth: \u201cYou\u2019re working in this community and the circles are pretty small that you run in. Someone recommended us to them. They have a portfolio of companies to help with some programs. And you just got to kind of know them, over a period of a year or so, back and forth on programs. ... We just developed the right relationships there. They were really intrigued by what we do. They said, \u2018Hey, we really think this is a national asset to help the country go in the right direction.\u2019\u201d\n\nExplore Beavercreek defense contractor wins new investment\n\nDDN: In a non-proprietary, layman\u2019s way, can you describe what you do?\n\nNorth: \u201cWe work in three main areas, which are antennas and radomes \u2014radomes are the covers that go outside antennas. Modeling and measurements. We build a lot of radar systems. We probably have one of the most widely used radars in the country, if not the world, that we produce. And then beyond that, we do integrated electronics. We do all sorts of electronics systems for direction-finding, for electronic warfare, electronic protection ...\n\n\u201cThose are kind of the three main areas. And there\u2019s a lot of overlap between those three, which is one of the things that makes us special, really understanding the overlap between those three domains.\u201d\n\nDDN: Are you finding the workers you need?\n\nNorth: \u201cDayton is really the best place for building airplanes, by the way. We have the customers. We have the AFRLs (Air Force Research Laboratory). We have the major commands at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. We have NASIC (National Air and Space Intelligence Center), who understands all of the intelligence stuff that is needed.\n\n\u201cAnd then you look at what you have, at all of the tooling and die, the automotive industry, and the people-workforce, who understand how to build stuff, who knows how to manufacture. That\u2019s the next big piece.\n\n\u201cSo one, you have customers. Two, you\u2019ve got a very smart workforce. And three, you have a great location, in a state that actually cares about building things. Unlike other states, aviation is probably the most important thing in the state of Ohio. At least, they make me feel like it is. So why would you build anywhere else?\u201d\n\nDDN: Why did you need this space?\n\nNorth: \u201cThe business is just growing so fast. ... This is going to be more of our robotics and machining, building and those sorts of the things here (on Indian Ripple Road). Primarily robotics. ... I would call this a robotics and assembly building.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone down the manufacturing path. But we\u2019re still very much known as an R&D house. People come to us with very, very hard problems. We do it all the way from initial concept, all the way up to production and out to the field.\n\n\u201cWe can move faster than a lot of the big, traditional defense contractors.\u201d"

Subscribe now\n\nVideo transcript\n\nMATTHEW BURGOYNE: Hello, I\u2019m Matthew Burgoyne, Co-Chair of the Digital Assets and Blockchain Group at Osler in Calgary.\n\nAn imperative question in the cryptocurrency industry is when exactly does a token become a security? This is relevant for Canadian token issuers, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the SEC in the U.S. and of course Binance and Coinbase, who were both recently sued by the SEC on the basis that they engaged in, among other things, unregistered offerings of security tokens. The recent decision from a U.S. court on the SEC Ripple dispute could potentially impact how we answer that question, especially with regards to the \u201cinvestment contract\u201d test.\n\nThe investment contract test is a crucial tool in determining whether the manner in which a token is sold constitutes a distribution of a security. In Canada, the Supreme Court decided in the \u201cPacific Coin\u201d case that an investment contract arises when all of the following have been met: There has been:\n\nan investment of money, in a common enterprise, with the expectation of profit to come significantly from the efforts of others.\n\nJuly 13, 2023, saw a landmark ruling by the United States District Court. It declared that Ripple Labs\u2019s XRP token constituted a security when sold to institutional investors, thereby falling under SEC oversight. However, when sold on a digital exchange or via a trading algorithm to the general public, the token was not deemed to be a security.\n\nThe court held that the facts surrounding the sale of the token are critical to understanding whether the token is an investment contract, since the token \u201cis not in and of itself a 'contract, or scheme or transaction' that embodies the requirements of an investment contract.\u201d\n\nInstitutional buyers would have reasonably expected that Ripple would use the proceeds for the XRP ecosystem, which would likely result in an increase in the token's value, according to the court.\n\nBut those who purchased the tokens on crypto exchanges didn't necessarily know if their payments for XRP went to Ripple or any other seller since the crypto exchanges used trading algorithms that matched buyers and sellers in blind transactions. Therefore, there wouldn\u2019t necessarily have been any expectation of profit coming significantly from Ripple\u2019s efforts.\n\nSo, what does this mean for Canadians?\n\nThe Ripple verdict offers Canadian regulators and market participants food for thought. If similar principles were applied in Canada, certain tokens sold on digital exchanges to the public via trading algorithms could evade being classified as securities. Conversely, if sold to institutional investors with the promise that sale proceeds will be used to further develop the token ecosystem, they may be regarded as securities. This might pave the way for a more nuanced approach in crypto asset classification.\n\nThe absence of a coherent, globally applied approach to crypto asset creation and distribution, forces regulators to fit crypto asset regulations into the traditional capital markets regime on a case-by-case basis.\n\nHere is the bottom line:\n\nCanadian token distributors should be cautious and seek legal advice before initiating any token distribution event, even if the distribution takes place offshore. Be prepared to defend against the argument that your project is distributing an investment contract. If there is an identifiable group or person whose efforts are essential for the success or failure of the project, it is best to obtain legal advice. Canadian securities regulators are monitoring the industry closely, and the penalties and sanctions for noncompliance can be costly.\n\nOsler\u2019s Digital Asset and Blockchain Group can help guide you through this novel regulatory landscape. Please reach out if you have any questions about securities laws and how they may impact your business in the ever-evolving digital asset space."

        "title": "Inside the DJ Moore ripple effect for the Bears: 'I just love the way he works' - The New York Times",
        "content": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. \u2014 Early in Chicago Bears training camp, rookie cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was on the receiving end of everything the Bears\u2019 best receiver had to offer.\n\nIn one-on-one drills, DJ Moore beat him.\n\nIn seven-on-sevens, DJ Moore beat him.\n\nIn team drills, DJ Moore beat him.\n\n\u201cYou know what? Good for him,\u201d defensive coordinator Alan Williams told The Athletic early in camp. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s going to see each week. DJ is a No. 1 receiver.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a singular \u201cWelcome to the NFL\u201d moment for Stevenson but a full range of NFL-caliber experiences.\n\n\u201cHonestly, there\u2019s no bad in it,\u201d Stevenson said then. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s always good. After every route or whenever I catch DJ, I kind of ask him some questions like, \u2018What are you looking for?\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s a good thing to have some vets to go against to be able to take some notes. Because at the end of day, it\u2019s a team sport.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no questioning that the Bears are a better team in 2023 because Moore is on their roster \u2014 the result of a blockbuster trade involving the first pick in the NFL Draft by general manager Ryan Poles.\n\nMoore was a headliner throughout camp, but Stevenson became one, too, from his trash-talking with receiver Chase Claypool, to igniting a melee with the Colts with a resounding hit on special teams to ending his preseason with an interception against the Bills.\n\nStevenson left camp as he should have: as a noteworthy starter.\n\nHe improved by facing Moore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s preparing him for what he\u2019s going to see every week,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSometimes he wins. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t. But they\u2019re game reps from him, so that experience is invaluable.\u201d\n\nConsider that part of the DJ Moore ripple effect. His presence is felt everywhere.\n\nDuring one of the most incredible plays of the 2022 NFL season, quarterback P.J. Walker saw two defenders slow down in their coverage on Moore as the star receiver decreased his pace.\n\nWalker knew he had them beat.\n\n\u201cI know his speed,\u201d Walker said before the Bears released him last week. \u201cHis pickup speed\u2019s a lot faster than their pickup speed.\u201d\n\nBombs away.\n\nIt came in Week 8 of last season for the Carolina Panthers. Walker let loose a pass from Carolina\u2019s 35-yard line and Moore made a diving catch against Falcons safety Dean Marlowe and linebacker Rashaan Evans a few steps into the end zone. The touchdown tied the game with 12 seconds left, though the Panthers lost in overtime.\n\nPJ WALKER JUST DID THAT. HAIL MARY TO DJ MOORE. pic.twitter.com/dDYwoZhaGG \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 30, 2022\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t looking for him,\u201d Walker said \u201cBut I feel he\u2019s down there.\u201d\n\nWhen he did see him, Walker knew what he had.\n\n\u201cOh, man, that\u2019s something I\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s just giving him an opportunity to make these plays. I\u2019ve seen him making them over a ton of guys.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s part of the DJ Moore effect.\n\nIt\u2019s real. Bears quarterback Justin Fields benefits from it now.\n\n\u201cWhen you put it up in the air, he\u2019s going to find the football,\u201d said Walker, now on the Cleveland Browns\u2019 practice squad. \u201cHe can go out there and make a play for you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something that Walker knows well after being Moore\u2019s teammate for the last three seasons with the Panthers. They\u2019re close friends. Family comes first for Moore. Forget the spotlight.\n\n\u201cEverything that you see him do, it\u2019d be for his kids, for sure,\u201d Walker said. \u201cLike all the celebrations and all the stuff that he does on the field, that\u2019s going to be for his kids. He\u2019s definitely one of those dudes who goes out there and he plays for his family and plays for his teammates.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship dates to college when Walker attempted to recruit Moore to Temple. The Owls wanted Moore to play safety. Moore went to Maryland as a receiver.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in high school, he played everything: running back, receiver, a bunch of stuff,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThey just liked his body physique for him to play safety at that level. He was a hell of a player.\u201d\n\nHe still is. Walker knows that better than anyone who has been through Halas Hall over the past year. Moore\u2019s seemingly instant chemistry with Fields didn\u2019t surprise Walker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him do things that were out of the ordinary for a receiver because he\u2019s smart,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys that can see coverages. He knows what he\u2019s getting on the football field. So when you get a guy like that, it makes the transition really easy for a quarterback like Justin.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Justin Fields on Justin Fields: Bears QB analyzes film of his top plays of 2022\n\nIn 2014, Eberflus was in his fourth season as the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 linebackers coach when receiver Dez Bryant scored 16 touchdowns \u2014 a career best after scoring 12 and 13, respectively, in the previous two seasons. He saw firsthand in practice and in games what Bryant meant to quarterback Tony Romo and a loaded Dallas offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are some similarities there,\u201d Eberflus said during a recent interview with The Athletic. \u201cDez was a big strong guy, who\u2019s just like DJ. DJ\u2019s strong. He\u2019s got strong hands; he\u2019s strong through the catch. He can use his body to stay open because of that strength. And when you have a guy that you can go to like that, it\u2019s so important because the quarterback can rely on that.\n\n\u201cAnd a lot of times what happens is when you have a guy like that, the coverage will shift, or they\u2019ll put a player on him that\u2019s probably their best player, if they\u2019re going to be singled up, and then that creates opportunities for everybody else, either through the coverage shift or through the personnel shift to that guy.\u201d\n\nDJ Moore is a quiet guy, but his play has spoken loudly since he joined the Bears via trade. (Scott Boehm / Associated Press)\n\nMoore is one of those players.\n\nEberflus would know. It\u2019s part of the DJ Moore problem.\n\nEberflus had a plan in place for Moore and the Panthers on Dec. 22, 2019, as the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 defensive coordinator. A week earlier, Moore had eight catches for 113 yards in a loss against the Seattle Seahawks. The Panthers weren\u2019t a good team, but Moore was a 1,000-yard receiver in his second season.\n\n\u201cWe knew he was a special player,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cAnd he needed to have some attention. If you\u2019re giving him attention by putting a good guy on him or our best player on him or a player over the top, we had a plan for him.\u201d\n\nMoore, though, played only six snaps. He left the game with a concussion. He finished with one catch for 1 yard on the third play from scrimmage.\n\n\u201cWe just kind of shifted back to our normal sets and our normal alignments because of his absence in that game,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cIt certainly helped us. I\u2019m pretty sure we won that game.\u201d\n\nThe Colts did. They ran away with a 38-6 victory.\n\nYears later, Eberflus and Williams, who was the Colts\u2019 defensive backs coach at the time, experienced what they planned for in practices at Halas Hall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSometimes when we\u2019re right because (the receiver\u2019s) mechanics are good and they are talented guys, sometimes you may not win the rep, even when you\u2019re right,\u201d Williams said early in camp. \u201cAnd sometimes that\u2019s what happens in the ballgame. You line up right, you execute, you do your technique and they make a play.\u201d\n\nMoore did exactly that throughout camp. The Bears know Moore will be a problem for opposing defenses because he was a problem for theirs.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to let that guy get a bunch of catches where he\u2019s very impactful in the game, because, of course, he\u2019s always going to be impactful on the game, somehow, some way,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cBut you want to try to minimize that risk.\u201d\n\nBut that opens up more for other players. Eberflus saw that in Dallas, too. The Cowboys had Jason Witten, Cole Beasley and Terrance Williams; the Bears have Cole Kmet, Darnell Mooney and Claypool. The Cowboys ran the ball well with DeMarco Murray; the Bears want to establish their identity by running the ball.\n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d Eberflus said, \u201cit\u2019s invaluable to have a guy that can call that attention on himself.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Why Bears GM Ryan Poles isn't shying away from higher expectations this year\n\nIn the Bears\u2019 wide receivers room at Halas Hall, Moore is quiet.\n\nThe same is true when he plays.\n\n\u201cI want him to be him,\u201d receivers coach/pass game coordinator Tyke Tolbert said. \u201cHe got here by being him. So don\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nBut everything Moore physically does on the field is, well, loud. It makes you pay attention.\n\n\u201cDJ don\u2019t talk hardly at all,\u201d Tolbert said. \u201cHe has a quiet demeanor. You tell him to do something he\u2019ll do it. Whatever it is. \u2018DJ, go back and catch some punts.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018OK.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018DJ, go block this guy.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018OK.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018DJ, go play corner while the other guys run.\u2019 \u2026. \u2018OK.\u2019 He\u2019ll jump over there and do it. He don\u2019t say much. He goes over there and does his job.\u201d\n\nEveryone watches him do that job as a receiver. Some try to learn from it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn the field, the one thing I\u2019ve noticed is just the way he mirrors his routes,\u201d rookie receiver Tyler Scott said. \u201cHe\u2019s really good at making you think one thing and doing another. The one thing about receiving that I\u2019ve learned over the past couple of years is that it\u2019s all about putting on a good act, and he does a good job at putting on a good act.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a skill some receivers never learn regardless of how fast or how athletic they are. The best receivers make route running an art form.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s impressive about DJ \u2014 and there\u2019s some really good receivers in the league that are like this, too \u2014 they take that craft of route running to a different level,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cTheir precision and detail is so good. They really take everything to heart. They literally want a number of routes to look exactly the same. And it might be four different routes. This certain stem and how I climb on this route looks exactly like three other routes or four other routes, and they have that off varying routes that they run.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to do. But Scott is trying.\n\nIt\u2019s part of that DJ Moore influence \u2014 even if he\u2019s not aware of it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one thing that I\u2019ve tried to take is just kind of mirroring those things up because that just puts the DB on his toes,\u201d Scott said. \u201cAt the end of the day, they don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, and if you make things look the same, now they\u2019re just guessing.\u201d\n\nOffensive coordinator Luke Getsy praised Moore for his cool when the ball is in the air.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just having the patience to let the ball come to you and not let the DB know that the ball\u2019s right there until it\u2019s already caught,\u201d Getsy said. \u201cYou can see those in him. It\u2019s been fun to let the young guys kind of learn that from him.\u201d\n\nDefensive backs have their reads and look for tells. Moore excels at eliminating them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe knows where the ball is going to be coming out of a break, based off a defense where Justin\u2019s going to put the ball at,\u201d Scott said. \u201cOr when he catches the ball, just knowing angles of the DBs and where they\u2019re coming from, it\u2019s almost like he plays in slow motion when I watch the film, but he\u2019s really just a step ahead of everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe Bears hope DJ Moore\u2019s instant chemistry with Justin Fields, center talking with NFL Network\u2019s Kyle Brandt, will pay immediate dividends. (Charles Rex Arbogast / Associated Press)\n\nT.J. Edwards has been here before. The Bears linebacker knows what it\u2019s like to be part of a team that just acquired a talented but overlooked receiver in a blockbuster trade.\n\nIt happened on April 28, 2022, with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\u201cWe just got A.J.

They know what special looks and feels like. They know what\u2019s real.\n\nTen months after the Eagles traded for Brown, they were playing in the Super Bowl. Brown established career highs, earned his second Pro Bowl honor and became a second-team All-Pro.

He comes here and he can do it all, man. He\u2019s making catches down the field. He\u2019s taking slants a long way after the catch. He\u2019s a guy who I think has been underrated in this league. I\u2019m excited for him and the offense in general.\u201d\n\nThe slant that Edwards referenced came in the middle of camp against the Bears\u2019 starting defense. No one touched him.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the DJ Moore vibe. He\u2019s different.\n\n\u201cI think he has had just an impact on the organization,\u201d quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko said. \u201cI mean when you bring a good player in and they make plays, that\u2019s fun to watch. That\u2019s having confidence in somebody that goes out and makes plays for you and that you can trust where that guy is going to be where he needs to be. And even if that throw is a little bit off, that he is going to help you, that\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bears defense saw that from Moore immediately during OTAs.\n\nA couple of deep balls from Fields were enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all just like, \u2018Man, appreciate your teammates,\u2019\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want on your team. Our defense gets to go against him every day. He\u2019s only going to make our corners better, our DBs, our back seven and our whole team better. He\u2019s just a guy who\u2019s confident, man. He knows what to do. He knows what type of player he is.\u201d\n\nStevenson, fellow rookie Terell Smith and veteran Jaylon Johnson dealt with Moore the most practice throughout camp. Eberflus loved it.\n\n\u201cBecause of the elite skill set that he has and the body control and the different speeds and the RPMs (real plus/minus) that he runs at, he\u2019s a hard cover,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cNothing but good things are going to happen by covering a guy like that every day. It\u2019s just a way to really enhance your skill, to sharpen your skill and take your skill to the next level if you\u2019re covering a guy like that.\u201d\n\nEveryone knows what happened on Moore\u2019s first catch in a Bears uniform. He turned a quick screen into a 62-yard touchdown against the Tennessee Titans in the preseason opener.\n\n\u201cI got there just in time, and he went right around and scored a touchdown \u2014 made magic happen,\u201d left tackle Braxton Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to have a guy like that who can make explosive plays.\u201d\n\nMore than a week later, Jones still was surprised it happened. He expected the back-side defenders to recover and get Moore after he and guard Teven Jenkins made their blocks.\n\nThe Titans didn\u2019t, though. Jones knows better now.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so fast and gets in and out of there,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI look back and I try to finish my guy one more time to the ground and then I look back and he\u2019s already near the touchdown.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s all part of the DJ Moore excitement. He still surprised the Bears with what he did.\n\nIn the Bears\u2019 final preseason game against the Buffalo Bills, Moore caught a pass over the middle, broke three tackles and finished with a 40-yard catch-and-run.\n\n\u201cHis acceleration is better than I thought,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cAnd then his change of speed, his start and stop is really good. He can go from a very high RPMs down to almost a stop; he can stop on a dime. And then also pick up that speed right away. So that\u2019s what\u2019s really hard. He can vary the RPMs. And he can do that at a fast rate, with his ability to start and stop on a dime.\u201d\n\nThe Bears measure all of that.\n\nHis presence should make things easier for Fields and Getsy.

        "content": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. \u2014 Early in Chicago Bears training camp, rookie cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was on the receiving end of everything the Bears\u2019 best receiver had to offer.\n\nIn one-on-one drills, DJ Moore beat him.\n\nIn seven-on-sevens, DJ Moore beat him.\n\nIn team drills, DJ Moore beat him.\n\n\u201cYou know what? Good for him,\u201d defensive coordinator Alan Williams told The Athletic early in camp. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s going to see each week. DJ is a No. 1 receiver.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a singular \u201cWelcome to the NFL\u201d moment for Stevenson but a full range of NFL-caliber experiences.\n\n\u201cHonestly, there\u2019s no bad in it,\u201d Stevenson said then. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s always good. After every route or whenever I catch DJ, I kind of ask him some questions like, \u2018What are you looking for?\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s a good thing to have some vets to go against to be able to take some notes. Because at the end of day, it\u2019s a team sport.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no questioning that the Bears are a better team in 2023 because Moore is on their roster \u2014 the result of a blockbuster trade involving the first pick in the NFL Draft by general manager Ryan Poles.\n\nMoore was a headliner throughout camp, but Stevenson became one, too, from his trash-talking with receiver Chase Claypool, to igniting a melee with the Colts with a resounding hit on special teams to ending his preseason with an interception against the Bills.\n\nStevenson left camp as he should have: as a noteworthy starter.\n\nHe improved by facing Moore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s preparing him for what he\u2019s going to see every week,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSometimes he wins. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t. But they\u2019re game reps from him, so that experience is invaluable.\u201d\n\nConsider that part of the DJ Moore ripple effect. His presence is felt everywhere.\n\nDuring one of the most incredible plays of the 2022 NFL season, quarterback P.J. Walker saw two defenders slow down in their coverage on Moore as the star receiver decreased his pace.\n\nWalker knew he had them beat.\n\n\u201cI know his speed,\u201d Walker said before the Bears released him last week. \u201cHis pickup speed\u2019s a lot faster than their pickup speed.\u201d\n\nBombs away.\n\nIt came in Week 8 of last season for the Carolina Panthers. Walker let loose a pass from Carolina\u2019s 35-yard line and Moore made a diving catch against Falcons safety Dean Marlowe and linebacker Rashaan Evans a few steps into the end zone. The touchdown tied the game with 12 seconds left, though the Panthers lost in overtime.\n\nPJ WALKER JUST DID THAT. HAIL MARY TO DJ MOORE. pic.twitter.com/dDYwoZhaGG \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 30, 2022\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t looking for him,\u201d Walker said \u201cBut I feel he\u2019s down there.\u201d\n\nWhen he did see him, Walker knew what he had.\n\n\u201cOh, man, that\u2019s something I\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s just giving him an opportunity to make these plays. I\u2019ve seen him making them over a ton of guys.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s part of the DJ Moore effect.\n\nIt\u2019s real. Bears quarterback Justin Fields benefits from it now.\n\n\u201cWhen you put it up in the air, he\u2019s going to find the football,\u201d said Walker, now on the Cleveland Browns\u2019 practice squad. \u201cHe can go out there and make a play for you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something that Walker knows well after being Moore\u2019s teammate for the last three seasons with the Panthers. They\u2019re close friends. Family comes first for Moore. Forget the spotlight.\n\n\u201cEverything that you see him do, it\u2019d be for his kids, for sure,\u201d Walker said. \u201cLike all the celebrations and all the stuff that he does on the field, that\u2019s going to be for his kids. He\u2019s definitely one of those dudes who goes out there and he plays for his family and plays for his teammates.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship dates to college when Walker attempted to recruit Moore to Temple. The Owls wanted Moore to play safety. Moore went to Maryland as a receiver.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in high school, he played everything: running back, receiver, a bunch of stuff,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThey just liked his body physique for him to play safety at that level. He was a hell of a player.\u201d\n\nHe still is. Walker knows that better than anyone who has been through Halas Hall over the past year. Moore\u2019s seemingly instant chemistry with Fields didn\u2019t surprise Walker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him do things that were out of the ordinary for a receiver because he\u2019s smart,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys that can see coverages. He knows what he\u2019s getting on the football field. So when you get a guy like that, it makes the transition really easy for a quarterback like Justin.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Justin Fields on Justin Fields: Bears QB analyzes film of his top plays of 2022\n\nIn 2014, Eberflus was in his fourth season as the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 linebackers coach when receiver Dez Bryant scored 16 touchdowns \u2014 a career best after scoring 12 and 13, respectively, in the previous two seasons. He saw firsthand in practice and in games what Bryant meant to quarterback Tony Romo and a loaded Dallas offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are some similarities there,\u201d Eberflus said during a recent interview with The Athletic. \u201cDez was a big strong guy, who\u2019s just like DJ. DJ\u2019s strong. He\u2019s got strong hands; he\u2019s strong through the catch. He can use his body to stay open because of that strength. And when you have a guy that you can go to like that, it\u2019s so important because the quarterback can rely on that.\n\n\u201cAnd a lot of times what happens is when you have a guy like that, the coverage will shift, or they\u2019ll put a player on him that\u2019s probably their best player, if they\u2019re going to be singled up, and then that creates opportunities for everybody else, either through the coverage shift or through the personnel shift to that guy.\u201d\n\nDJ Moore is a quiet guy, but his play has spoken loudly since he joined the Bears via trade. (Scott Boehm / Associated Press)\n\nMoore is one of those players.\n\nEberflus would know. It\u2019s part of the DJ Moore problem.\n\nEberflus had a plan in place for Moore and the Panthers on Dec. 22, 2019, as the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 defensive coordinator. A week earlier, Moore had eight catches for 113 yards in a loss against the Seattle Seahawks. The Panthers weren\u2019t a good team, but Moore was a 1,000-yard receiver in his second season.\n\n\u201cWe knew he was a special player,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cAnd he needed to have some attention. If you\u2019re giving him attention by putting a good guy on him or our best player on him or a player over the top, we had a plan for him.\u201d\n\nMoore, though, played only six snaps. He left the game with a concussion. He finished with one catch for 1 yard on the third play from scrimmage.\n\n\u201cWe just kind of shifted back to our normal sets and our normal alignments because of his absence in that game,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cIt certainly helped us. I\u2019m pretty sure we won that game.\u201d\n\nThe Colts did. They ran away with a 38-6 victory.\n\nYears later, Eberflus and Williams, who was the Colts\u2019 defensive backs coach at the time, experienced what they planned for in practices at Halas Hall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSometimes when we\u2019re right because (the receiver\u2019s) mechanics are good and they are talented guys, sometimes you may not win the rep, even when you\u2019re right,\u201d Williams said early in camp. \u201cAnd sometimes that\u2019s what happens in the ballgame. You line up right, you execute, you do your technique and they make a play.\u201d\n\nMoore did exactly that throughout camp. The Bears know Moore will be a problem for opposing defenses because he was a problem for theirs.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to let that guy get a bunch of catches where he\u2019s very impactful in the game, because, of course, he\u2019s always going to be impactful on the game, somehow, some way,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cBut you want to try to minimize that risk.\u201d\n\nBut that opens up more for other players. Eberflus saw that in Dallas, too. The Cowboys had Jason Witten, Cole Beasley and Terrance Williams; the Bears have Cole Kmet, Darnell Mooney and Claypool. The Cowboys ran the ball well with DeMarco Murray; the Bears want to establish their identity by running the ball.\n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d Eberflus said, \u201cit\u2019s invaluable to have a guy that can call that attention on himself.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Why Bears GM Ryan Poles isn't shying away from higher expectations this year\n\nIn the Bears\u2019 wide receivers room at Halas Hall, Moore is quiet.\n\nThe same is true when he plays.\n\n\u201cI want him to be him,\u201d receivers coach/pass game coordinator Tyke Tolbert said. \u201cHe got here by being him. So don\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nBut everything Moore physically does on the field is, well, loud. It makes you pay attention.\n\n\u201cDJ don\u2019t talk hardly at all,\u201d Tolbert said. \u201cHe has a quiet demeanor. You tell him to do something he\u2019ll do it. Whatever it is. \u2018DJ, go back and catch some punts.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018OK.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018DJ, go block this guy.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018OK.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018DJ, go play corner while the other guys run.\u2019 \u2026. \u2018OK.\u2019 He\u2019ll jump over there and do it. He don\u2019t say much. He goes over there and does his job.\u201d\n\nEveryone watches him do that job as a receiver. Some try to learn from it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn the field, the one thing I\u2019ve noticed is just the way he mirrors his routes,\u201d rookie receiver Tyler Scott said. \u201cHe\u2019s really good at making you think one thing and doing another. The one thing about receiving that I\u2019ve learned over the past couple of years is that it\u2019s all about putting on a good act, and he does a good job at putting on a good act.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a skill some receivers never learn regardless of how fast or how athletic they are. The best receivers make route running an art form.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s impressive about DJ \u2014 and there\u2019s some really good receivers in the league that are like this, too \u2014 they take that craft of route running to a different level,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cTheir precision and detail is so good. They really take everything to heart. They literally want a number of routes to look exactly the same. And it might be four different routes. This certain stem and how I climb on this route looks exactly like three other routes or four other routes, and they have that off varying routes that they run.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to do. But Scott is trying.\n\nIt\u2019s part of that DJ Moore influence \u2014 even if he\u2019s not aware of it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one thing that I\u2019ve tried to take is just kind of mirroring those things up because that just puts the DB on his toes,\u201d Scott said. \u201cAt the end of the day, they don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, and if you make things look the same, now they\u2019re just guessing.\u201d\n\nOffensive coordinator Luke Getsy praised Moore for his cool when the ball is in the air.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just having the patience to let the ball come to you and not let the DB know that the ball\u2019s right there until it\u2019s already caught,\u201d Getsy said. \u201cYou can see those in him. It\u2019s been fun to let the young guys kind of learn that from him.\u201d\n\nDefensive backs have their reads and look for tells. Moore excels at eliminating them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe knows where the ball is going to be coming out of a break, based off a defense where Justin\u2019s going to put the ball at,\u201d Scott said. \u201cOr when he catches the ball, just knowing angles of the DBs and where they\u2019re coming from, it\u2019s almost like he plays in slow motion when I watch the film, but he\u2019s really just a step ahead of everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe Bears hope DJ Moore\u2019s instant chemistry with Justin Fields, center talking with NFL Network\u2019s Kyle Brandt, will pay immediate dividends. (Charles Rex Arbogast / Associated Press)\n\nT.J. Edwards has been here before. The Bears linebacker knows what it\u2019s like to be part of a team that just acquired a talented but overlooked receiver in a blockbuster trade.\n\nIt happened on April 28, 2022, with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\u201cWe just got A.J. Brown!\u201d Edwards remembered, his excitement and emotion returning.\n\n\u201cHe walks into the building \u2014 and that\u2019s another big dude. Another just specimen. He\u2019s a freak \u2014 a dude who can do everything, run by you, run good routes, run after the catch.\u201d\n\nPlayers know first. They know what players can do and what they can\u2019t. They know what special looks and feels like. They know what\u2019s real.\n\nTen months after the Eagles traded for Brown, they were playing in the Super Bowl. Brown established career highs, earned his second Pro Bowl honor and became a second-team All-Pro.
