        "title": "Ripple effects of Dexter Tyson plant shutdown being felt across southeast Mo. - KFVS",
        "content": "STODDARD COUNTY, Mo. (KFVS) - When one of Stoddard County\u2019s largest employers closed its doors one month ago, it left hundreds of people without a job right before the Holidays.\n\nA month later, Tyson\u2019s closure is being felt across southeast Missouri as local leaders fight to reopen the facility.\n\nFriday, October 1 is a day hundreds of people in Stoddard County won\u2019t forget. Around 700 people were laid off when Tyson\u2019s Dexter operation closed.\n\nThe company said in a statement the decision to close the Dexter plant, along with plants in North Little Rock, Arkansas; Corydon, Indiana; and Noel, Missouri was to lower costs.\n\nNow, the closure has caused a ripple effect through Dexter and surrounding communities.\n\nThe chicken houses on Preston Arnold\u2019s farm in Sikeston have been empty since Tyson closed.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a situation where we can walk off and get another job to pay our bills,\u201d said Arnold.\n\nArnold has raised chickens for Tyson for the past 4-and-a-half years.\n\nWith no other local company to take his birds, his business can\u2019t function.\n\n\u201cYou got a multi-million dollar operation that is not good for anything but the land it sits on,\u201d said Arnold.\n\nWith the future of Arnold\u2019s farm up in the air, he\u2019s trying to avoid going under.\n\n\u201cWe have to take out multi-million-dollar loans to get into this business. To get those loans we have to put up collateral, so if we don\u2019t get an integrator in here within the next year we stand a chance of losing everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nOver in Dexter, City Manager David Wyman said most of the Tyson plant employees found work in the surrounding area, but numerous businesses in town aren\u2019t as fortunate.\n\nHe said they\u2019re suffering since much of their work involved the chicken processor.\n\n\u201cElectricians that spent a lot of their time working at the Tyson plant, well, they aren\u2019t able to anymore. Plumbers that would work down there to keep their pipes opened up, you got convenience stores that were opened 24 hours a day because they were working 24 hours a day and they would do really good business at shift change and that\u2019s all gone,\u201d said Wyman.\n\nBut the fight to save the facility, and help those businesses isn\u2019t over.\n\nWyman said the city is working to find a company to move into the facility on County Road 717.\n\n\u201cWe have a company that is slightly different type of industry and would not employ as many people but it would utilize all the real estate down there, so I know that that company and Tyson have been talking and they are close but as you can imagine it is a very complicated deal,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Sikeston on Preston Arnold\u2019s farm, he\u2019s being proactive trying to find ways to help his situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve reached out to high politicians, local politicians and tried to get some assistance with our FSA loans and I really haven\u2019t heard anything about that that would help us out dramatically and then we need assistance from the government with our taxes with getting another integrator in here to take us over,\u201d said Arnold.\n\nCopyright 2023 KFVS.

        "content": "The owner of the Union Jack Pub in Broad Ripple said she is \"fed up\" with the construction causing her restaurant to lose business.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Business owners in downtown Broad Ripple said they are \u201ctired\u201d and \u201cfed up\u201d as construction continues to shut down streets in the area.\n\nThe project first started back in early 2022, but after delays in the timeline, it is now expected to wrap up this month.\n\nUnion Jack Pub owner Chelsey Wetzel said she has reached a breaking point after what she calls a lack of communication and accountability from the city.\n\nDear @IndyMayorJoe, @IndyDPW, we have an 8yr old & a 6yr old & have lost more than 6 figures on the construction delays on BR Ave, & today you can\u2019t access our business. We cannot get emails or calls returned & we have bills to pay. SOS! We need help. Please advise. Please help. \u2014 Union Jack Pub (@UnionJackPub) November 15, 2023\n\nWednesday morning, Wetzel said in a Facebook post that road closures blocked the alley entrance to her business.\n\n\u201cWe have no access to the back of our building, which is where our parking is because there is no parking in the front. Deliveries couldn\u2019t be made. We couldn\u2019t get the food truck out. We just couldn\u2019t do normal business things this morning, and we were pretty blindsided by it,\u201d Wetzel said.\n\nFriends, tired and fed up is an understatement. We attempted to go to work this morning and Winthrop was closed. They... Posted by Union Jack Pub-Broad Ripple on Wednesday, November 15, 2023\n\nAs a result of the ongoing construction, Wetzel said her family\u2019s business has taken a huge financial hit.\n\n\u201cThis is our heart and soul. We are raising our young children on this business. We lost as much as 70% some of these months, which is far more than what COVID could\u2019ve even dreamt of doing to us,\u201d Wetzel said. \u201cOur life savings is just wiped out because we thought this was going to take a lot less time. We were told this was going to take a lot less time. We made business decisions based on very wrong information.\u201d\n\nOther business owners in the Broad Ripple share the same feeling.\n\n\u201cSales have dropped across the board 75 to 90%,\u201d said Robert Sabatini, who owns three bars in the downtown area\u2014Rock Lobster, Average Joe\u2019s and Mineshaft Saloon. He said there needs to be some kind of accountability for the financial impact on the businesses.\n\n\u201cThey promised us a 135-day project, which has now reached out to just short of two years,\u201d Sabatini said. \u201cThey are still doing touch-up work all over the place, and you just never know where they are going to be or which street is going to be covered up from one day to the next.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, owners like Wetzel and Sabatini are pleading for more customers to come back to Broad Ripple.\n\n\u201cWe would like to keep this 44-year-old institution going,\u201d Wetzel said.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are as safe as any place in the city, and we just want everybody to come back and see the fruits of what we have all been suffering through for months on end now,\u201d Sabatini said.\n\nStatement from Indy DPW:\n\n\"Indy DPW is days away from completing the most disruptive traffic elements in the Broad Ripple Avenue Improvements project. When finalized, long-running issues related to flooding will be resolved, along with safer pedestrian facilities and beautification initiatives. The investment of more than $8 million into the neighborhood's infrastructure promises to be a boon for residents and business owners for decades to come.\""

        "title": "Global Ripple Effect: How GIJC23 Impacted GIJN Fellows Around the World - Global Investigative Journalism Network",
        "content": "On Thursday evening, a day before the Global Investigative Journalism Conference was to end, Mariusz Sepiolo, a Polish reporter from the independent investigative outlet VSquare approached Bastian Obermayer, a Pulitzer Award-winning journalist from neighboring Germany who was part of the team that investigated the Panama Papers \u2014 a certified rock star of investigative journalism. Sepiolo had a simple request: he wanted Obermayer to say something about their independent outlet.\n\nAt GIJC23, GIJN sponsored more than 100 fellows from dozens of developing and transitioning countries.\n\n\u201cWe planned to gather such short videos and publish them on our social media,\u201d Sepiolo explains. And he was somewhat surprised when Obermayer agreed \u201cin the blink of an eye.\u201d\n\nIt was moments like these that stood out for many of GIJN\u2019s fellows at the 13th Global Investigative Journalism Conference (#GIJC23), where they met other journalists and colleagues whose work they had admired or looked up to. The conference is one of the main gatherings of investigative journalists throughout the world, and this year more than 2,100 journalists from 130 countries attended. It boasted dozens of panel discussions on investigative techniques as well as numerous workshops and networking sessions.\n\nFor each conference, GIJN also raises money to bring journalists from developing countries to the conference for free. The fellows are chosen through a competitive process, based on the kind of journalism they are practicing in their own countries. Each fellow is provided airfare, lodging, and a ticket to attend the conference.\n\nAt GIJC23, GIJN sponsored more than 100 fellows from dozens of developing and transitioning countries. GIJN partners and affiliated groups also sponsored hundreds more. For many of these journalists, it was their first time attending GIJC and it provided them with invaluable access to other reporters, tips, and tools that they would otherwise never see or know about.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen so many great investigators from different parts of the world in one place. On the one hand it looked like an anthill. On the other hand, everything was well organized,\u201d says Alexander Yarashevich, a GIJN fellow currently working in exile in Czechia for the Belarusian Investigative Center.\n\nStrengthening Data Journalism\n\nFor some fellows, especially those coming from small newsrooms in developing countries, the conference was a rare opportunity to acquire new skills, particularly in data journalism. The conference offered a wide variety of workshops and panel discussions \u2014 starting from the basics, like training with Microsoft Excel \u2014 to more advanced topics such as data visualization techniques and the use of tools like Flourish.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot of tools,\u201d says Rifthi Ali, a fellow from Sri Lanka, \u201ca lot of new things for data journalism and how I can use it in my stories.. So I plan to use what I have learned from the conference.\u201d\n\nFor Ali, a session on using right-to-information laws to create more transparency and public awareness led to the idea that he could initiate something similar in his own country Sri Lanka. After that session, he was able to speak face to face with one of the speakers, who offered advice on how he could set up a center for RTI advocacy in Sri Lanka.\n\nChat GPT and AI\n\nEven though data journalism was a top priority for most fellows, the conference also took the conversation beyond simply using data as part of investigations. For some fellows it was their first exposure to how new AI tools like ChatGPT can aid in their investigative work.\n\nNatalija Jovanovic, GIJN fellow from Serbia, says those panels stood out for her. \u201cWe added to our own growing list of tools and things that we use to pursue our stories,\u201d she explains. \u201dSo we are already using and applying the knowledge, in particular when it comes to ChatGPT and creating shortcuts for going through Google and finding the documents that we need and translating the documents from foreign languages and just applying all that to our daily work.\u201d\n\nMercedes Bluske, a GIJN fellow from Bolivia, echoed Jovanovic\u2019s comments, saying that the conference training helped her feel confident enough that she would try to incorporate the use of AI in investigative work into her reporting going forward.\n\nFostering Collaboration for Better Investigation\n\nAnother key aspect of the GIJN\u2019s global conferences is encouraging collaboration, thanks to both regional networking sessions and panels where journalists talk about how transnational collaborations can be made more effective.\n\n\u201cThere are two major collaborations that I have been able to make as a result of the conference, apart from being able to discuss different story ideas.\u201d \u2014 Nigerian GIJN fellow Blessing Oladunjoye\n\nFor Yian Lee, a fellow from Taiwan, he has seen almost immediate results from attending the conference. \u201cI am already working on a story with a journalist I got to know during GIJC23 as well as using some of the tools and databases I learned from some of the workshops,\u201d he says.\n\nOne Nigerian fellow whose work focuses on women, children, education, and persons with disabilities says GIJC23 showed her how she could expand the scope of her work. \u201cThere are two major collaborations that I have been able to make as a result of the conference, apart from being able to discuss different story ideas,\u201d Blessing Oladunjoye explains, adding that the workshops and panels also helped generate leads for stories she can replicate in Nigeria.\n\nIn addition, the conference provided Oladunjoye more connections and informal mentors for her work. \u201cI have made friends, journalists from different countries, and if I ever need anything I can always reach out to them and can get help,\u201d she says.\n\nGlobal Community\n\nInvestigative journalism can be a lonely endeavor. For many fellows, attending GIJC23 was a rare moment of kinship and solidarity, when they recognized that there were many others like them who were trying to investigate and dig deep into stories and issues, despite growing challenges to press freedom throughout the world.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of attending are the tools that are being shared by colleagues, but also the opportunity, the access you have to journalists all over the world,\u201d says Bluske. And not just colleagues; she points out that she was able to meet potential funders at GIJC23 as well. \u201cThis was a global community welcoming you and supporting you to achieve bigger goals together,\u201d she says.\n\nYarashevich agreed, saying the sessions he attended offered new insights on how he could generate more funding for investigative projects that are just starting their newsrooms.\n\nIt was this sense of belonging to a larger community that was the most energizing and rewarding aspect of the conference for many of GIJN\u2019s fellows. \u201cYou sit behind your desk, you call people, sometimes travel and meet them, you dig into Excel spreadsheets,\u201d says Sepiolo of his daily work as a journalist. In that day-to-day work, it\u2019s rare that you feel the work you\u2019re doing is relevant and that you\u2019re part of something larger, he adds, but at GIJC23: \u201cI felt I\u2019m not alone.\u201d"
