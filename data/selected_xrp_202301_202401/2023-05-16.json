        "content": "Ripple\u2019s native token XRP is on the verge of turning its fortune owing to its developments in the case against SEC. Some analysts predict that XRP price\u2019s subtle but subsequent surge is very close. As speculation has it, the recovery would be close to 50%, making the coin the largest gainer of the first quarter. However, the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market would suffer a minor loss during the same period.\n\nRipple vs. SEC has entered its third year. It all started with the SEC filing an opposition in court against Ripple. Later, Ripple filed the redacted reply. The case is now on the verge of finalization, which has led to multiple rumors about XRP\u2019s price spike. Let\u2019s understand more about XRP and what\u2019s hidden in the future for traders.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat is XRP?\n\nThe cryptocurrencies are of many types, algorithms, and various consensus mechanisms. Ripple is also decentralized, but less than what Bitcoin and Ethereum claim.\n\nIn contrast to them, it works in tandem with the current banking system to make improvements rather than attempting to replace it. Nevertheless, because of its numerous unique characteristics and significant advancements, it is a cryptocurrency that might outlive others.\n\nThe XRP price is trying to consolidate since the heavy crash in 2021. The price dropped to $0.56 and then recovered by pulling the price up to $1.5. The coin is back at $0.5 again.\n\nXRP Price Analysis\n\nThe last week was quite dramatic for Ripple. The price touched a weekly high of $0.58 before slipping to the low of $0.47. The support formed at $0.46. The price remained sluggish around $0.53, then made a smaller correction and dropped to $0.50. The coin recovered slightly and began another sluggish term at $0.52.\n\nHowever, the resistance level at $0.57 may cause the price to return to the previous support level. Furthermore, the XRP price has not shown any pattern to point out, therefore, the next week is likely to showcase no such highs and lows.\n\nHere\u2019s what one of the top promoters of XRP, bitboy is predicting for XRP price moving ahead. He is predicting XRP price can rise as high as $12.\n\nXRP Price Prediction for 2023\n\nThe current price of XRP is $0.515707 USD, and its 24-hour trading volume is $1,555,586,379. XRP is up 0.25% in the last 24 hours. The market capitalization at this time is USD $26,635,949,369. There are 51,649,390,115 XRP coins in circulation, with a maximum supply of 100,000,000,000 coins.\n\nAccording to the chart, after an unsatisfactory year in 2021, the coin showed improvement in 2022. Despite tremendous plunges and rallies, the coin kept recovering. It seems the traders still have faith in the coin and are optimistic about the recovery. Before closing in 2022, XRP price plummeted to $0.309. The price recovered in 2023 but fell again later. The price movement formed a double bottom on the chart. Two bottoms, two lows, that resemble the letter \u201cW,\u201d are present. Here, the W forms around $0.30. It is regarded as sufficient for the pattern\u2019s validation. The \u201cneckline,\u201d or highest point of a rebound, is marked by a horizontal line and is currently located at or near $0.56.\n\nWhen there is a double bottom, which typically indicates a bullish reversal, investors have the opportunity to profit from a bullish rally. Following a double bottom, it is common to take long positions that will profit from rising security prices.\n\nMoreover, RSI is supporting the double bottom pattern. All the indicators are pointing towards a bullish indication for the coin. Price ranges of $0.49 and $0.60 are anticipated for 2023, respectively.\n\nXRP Price Prediction for 2024-2025\n\nThe minimum XRP price in 2024 is anticipated to be around $0.719928. The highest XRP price anticipated might be close to $0.889911. In general, the price of trading in 2024 may be $0.749925. The minimum and maximum prices of XRP are predicted to be around $1.04 and $1.25, respectively, in 2025. The typical anticipated trading expense is $1.07.\n\nXRP Price Prediction for 2026-2027\n\nIt is predicted that the minimum XRP price in 2026 will be $1.49 and the maximum will be $1.79. The trading fee will be approximately $1.53 per transaction. Prices for XRP are projected to be $2.56 and $2.25 in 2027. It will typically trade for $2.33.\n\nXRP Price Prediction for 2028-2030\n\nThe average XRP price is anticipated to be around $3.49. It might fall to $3.37 at the very least, but it might still rise to $3.91 by the end of 2028. XRP will be traded between $4.73 and $5.86 in 2029. Throughout the year, its average cost is anticipated to be around $4.87. The highest XRP price of $8.20 will determine the year 2030. However, it may decrease to about $7.24. Therefore, $7.43 is the anticipated average trading price."

        "content": "Ale\u0161 Fiala embeds Gurdau Winery into sloping terrain\n\nAmong the lush fields and vineyards in Kurd\u011bjov village in the rural Czech Republic, Gurdau Winery seamlessly blends with its undulating landscape. In 2012, Gurdau Winery embarked on its journey amidst the virgin lands of Kurd\u011bjov village, where the first vines were meticulously planted upon the village\u2019s slopes. Historically renowned for supplying fine wines to Mikulov and Brno, as well as the esteemed courts of Moravia, the winery proudly carries the village\u2019s name, symbolizing its deep-rooted connection to the region\u2019s rich winemaking heritage.\n\nThe winery\u2019s architectural design undertaken by the studio Ale\u0161 Fiala thoughtfully embraces the surrounding landscape, harmoniously blending with the gentle curve of the terrain amidst a sea of hills. With this gesture, the architects sought to forge a symbiotic relationship between architecture and nature. The roof of the structure is adorned with an extensive green cover, while 150 shrubs and mature trees have been strategically planted in the surrounding area, some of which even pierce through the perforated roof. As time passes, the full impact and benefits of this new green landscape on both the winery and the natural surroundings will gradually unfold, painting a picturesque tapestry for years to come. all images by BoysPlayNice\n\nlike A Ripple in the Landscape\n\nConstructed with reinforced concrete, the two-story building of Gurdau Winery fulfills various functions. The subterranean part hosts a cellar that serves as a hub for wine production, storage, and preservation. The ground level encompasses areas dedicated to wine tasting, seating, and sales. Additionally, two apartments are available for those seeking occasional overnight accommodations.\n\nAccording to the design team, while the winery embraces a traditional in-ground setting, its architectural concept embodies a contemporary and timeless essence. The atmosphere within the premises encapsulates beauty, elegance, and absolute comfort. The choice of materials, including exposed concrete, glass, metal, as well as oak and acacia wood, creates a neat and direct aesthetic that complements the organic form of the building. Every detail is meticulously crafted, ensuring precision and quality. Thanks to expansive glazed surfaces, generous terraces, and a pitched roof, the winery establishes a direct connection with the surrounding scenery. This integration allows for a diverse range of natural experiences, capturing the ever-changing moods and seasons within the space.\n\n\n\nthe roof is adorned with an extensive green cover\n\nOrganic Architecture melds with its setting\n\nThe team at Ale\u0161 Fiala sought to seamlessly integrate the building within the landscape, creating a sense of warmth and harmonious integration with its origin. The terraces and the artificial hill of the green roof offer breathtaking views and an airy ambiance, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the captivating scenery of Kurd\u011bjov\u2019s horizons. In the distance, the majestic presence of P\u00e1lava can be admired, while the vast plains stretch towards Austria. The interior spaces of the winery are designed to be versatile, fostering social interactions, romantic moments, as well as peaceful contemplation while savoring a glass of wine.\n\n\u2018We believe that the Gurdau Winery concept will make a significant contribution to the rapidly growing and increasing wine and wine-tourist culture in the Czech Republic, and will support the growth of a new charming tradition of cultivated encounters and connections between man, wine and landscape,\u2019 shared the architects.\n\n\n\nemerging as a wave in the landscape\n\nembodying sustainability & minimizing ecological impact\n\nThe Gurdau Winery exemplifies a commitment to sustainability, harmoniously blending with the natural landscape while minimizing its environmental footprint. The entire building is shrouded by a curved extensive green roof, allowing it to blend into the surroundings. As the vegetation flourishes, the winery becomes nearly invisible in distant views, preserving the visual harmony of the landscape.\n\nThe surrounding areas are thoughtfully adorned with various shrubs and mature trees, contributing to the creation of an optimal microclimate. Strategically situated amidst the vineyard, the winery minimizes the need for transportation of raw materials and workers. The production areas are ingeniously located underground, while customer areas embrace natural sunlight through a glass fa\u00e7ade, harnessing passive energy to reduce energy consumption. To prevent overheating during scorching summer months, the winery employs thermally insulating triple glazing combined with wooden oak slats, ample roof overhang, and pergola shading with tarpaulins. These measures ensure optimal temperature regulation while maintaining a comfortable indoor environment. Rainwater is collected in a storage tank and used for irrigation of the vineyard.\n\n\n\ntrees pierce the circular cutouts of the roof\n\n\n\nthe gentle curve is informed by the undulating topography"

        "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: the ripple effects are becoming clear now in Europe. - Slate",
        "content": "Germany\u2019s announcement on Saturday that it will send Ukraine another $2.9 billion worth of weapons\u2014as much as it has previously sent in the 15 months since Russia\u2019s invasion\u2014is being hailed as the clearest sign yet of Berlin\u2019s all-in support for Kyiv\u2019s war effort.\n\nOver the same weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky flew to Italy, France, and Britain, as well as Germany, where more arms and unflagging support were pledged from all parties. Even Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\u2014who ran for office last fall as a populist friendly to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2014declared, \u201cWe bet on the victory of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe events, combined, bolster the impression that we are witnessing a significant shift happening in Europe. The old, post\u2013Cold War Europe was marked by a casual attitude toward national defense and accommodation with Moscow (on the theory that open trade promotes peace). The new Europe\u2014a phrase that popped up just days after the invasion, along with a Europe \u201cprofoundly transformed\u201d\u2014is boosting defense spending, severing ties with Russia, and forging tighter bonds of unity than the European Union or the NATO military alliance have ever felt.\n\nBut how deeply woven, how real, are the strands of this New Europe, not just in words but in deeds, and not just for the moment but for months and years to come? And to what extent is Germany\u2014the continent\u2019s largest, wealthiest nation and its most bountiful arms supplier to Ukraine\u2014stepping up to what might seem to be a logical role as its leader? The answers to both questions have huge implications for the shape and unity of Europe; its relations with the rest of the world; and, most urgently, its success in helping Ukraine beat back Putin\u2019s aggression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI spent a month this spring as writer-in-residence at the American Academy in Berlin, trying to get a grip on these questions by talking (mainly on background) with foreign policy leaders in the Bundestag (Germany\u2019s parliament), national-security advisers, think-tank specialists, and political journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conclusion I reached\u2014based on a wide consensus across party lines\u2014is that Germany\u2019s pivot toward a more active, responsible role in European security has taken hold more widely and deeply, at least in the country\u2019s self-image, than anyone could have imagined just a couple of years ago.\n\nHowever, in terms of actual policy and priorities, the shift has fallen far short of transformative\u2014and many of my sources have doubts about how long the shift will endure, especially after the war has passed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shift began with a sudden, startling jolt. On Feb. 27, 2022, just three days after Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2014the leader of the dovish Social Democratic Party, who had held the country\u2019s top post for not quite three months\u2014delivered a speech to the Bundestag, declaring that, as a result of Russia\u2019s aggression, Germany had reached a \u201cZeitenwende\u201d\u2014a historic turning point, the start of a new era. The invasion, Scholz said, \u201cthreatens our entire postwar order,\u201d and so, it is \u201cour duty to support Ukraine to the best of our ability in its defense against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading army.\u201d\n\nIn the most dramatic part of his speech, Scholz announced an immediate infusion of 100 billion euros (about $109 billion) to the German defense budget (which, that year, totaled about 50 billion euros) and promised, from that point on, to spend 2 percent of Germany\u2019s gross domestic product on defense\u2014a pledge that all the NATO allies had made back in 2013 but that most (very much including Germany) had not fulfilled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTurning point\u201d was an understatement. For 75 years, since just after the end of World War II, Germany\u2019s political leaders had avoided even talking about defense budgets or weapons of war, sensitive to their neighbors\u2019 fear that the slightest hint of a military buildup might trigger a revival of its imperial or Nazi past. (Germany sent a few thousand troops to Afghanistan, but more as a token gesture of good standing in NATO. Sending arms to other nations in Europe was taboo.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClaudia Major, a director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told me, \u201cBefore, defense issues were ignored or stigmatized. The defense industry and arms exports were described as \u2018evil.\u2019 The majority of Germans were pacifists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion changed all that. In this sense, Scholz\u2019s Zeitenwende speech was revolutionary, both in its acknowledgment of something new in the world and the need to confront it.\n\nStill, his subsequent actions fell short of that standard.\n\nFor instance, it turned out that the extra 100 billion euros for defense, earmarked for a \u201cspecial fund,\u201d would be spent out over a period of at least the next five years, and possibly as many as eight to 10 years if not longer. In 2023, I was told, the government will spend just 8.3 billion of this fund. At that rate, it will take 11 years to dish out the full amount.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, as part of the deal creating the special fund, Germany\u2019s baseline annual defense budget\u2014now at 50.1 billion euros\u2014will be frozen. And Scholz\u2019s pledge to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense will be deferred until after the special fund is depleted. Right now Germany is spending about 1.7 percent of GDP; given the budget freeze, if the overall economy grows, that percentage will decline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the special fund is being used not to fill gaps in Germany\u2019s defense forces or to refurbish its defense industry, but rather to buy high-profile, foreign-built weapons, such as F-35 stealth aircraft and heavy troop-carrying helicopters, neither of which speak much to Germany\u2019s near-term defense needs.\n\nAt the same time, the weapons being sent to Ukraine\u2014which are substantial and very useful\u2014come mainly from Germany\u2019s stockpiles. Because of the budget freeze, there is no money to replenish these stocks. Erich Vad, a retired German general who served as former Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s military policy adviser, recently wrote that while Germany is finally focusing on NATO\u2019s defense needs, it \u201clacks almost everything\u201d to do much about it, citing massive workforce and munitions shortages. Further depleting these defense stocks to assist Ukraine means that these shortages are likely to intensify in the coming years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inconsistencies of Scholz\u2019s policies\u2014the incompletion of his pivot, especially in the defense realm\u2014are due, in large part, to the nature of the German government, especially the particular government in power. Scholz presides over a three-party coalition (one more party than usual): his own Social Democratic Party, the centrist Free Democratic Party, and the Green Party.\n\nLike all other Green parties, the German variant is avidly environmentalist, wanting to fund renewable sources of energy and slash fossil fuels. But it is unique in that it also supports military assistance to countries under particularly horrendous attack. This trait took hold in 1999, with the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo. The Green leader at the time, Joschka Fischer, declared that the party\u2019s traditional support for human rights and pacifism couldn\u2019t always both be observed, that extreme human-rights violations sometimes had to be met with armaments. So it was, as well, in February 2022, with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2014a clear violation of human rights. The Greens, in fact, were the first to call for sending arms to Kyiv\u2019s defending army.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon enough, all of Germany\u2019s major parties\u2014the coalition partners and the Christian Democratic Union (Merkel\u2019s conservative party, which the 2021 election ousted from power)\u2014joined in. Only the Left Party and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) oppose sending arms: the AfD because it supports Putin, the Left because of its onetime alliance with Moscow\u2014it grew out of the East German Communist Party\u2014and because it associates any form of German militarism with Nazism. I asked a Left leader if he was embarrassed that he held the same position as the fascists. He replied, \u201cYes, certainly.\u201d (The AfD holds just 10 percent of the seats in the Bundestag, and the Left holds 5, just barely enough to hang on to any seats at all.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, all three coalition partners are also leery of higher defense spending. The Greens want to spend more on green energy; the Social Democratic Party wants to increase social-welfare spending; the Free Democratic Party wants to cut deficits. As part of the coalition bargaining after the election, the FPD\u2019s leader, Christian Lindner, became finance minister. In Berlin, department ministers have ultimate authority over their domains. Chancellors cannot overrule them. Nor is there anything like the American National Security Council, where cabinet secretaries hammer out their disputes and the president decides the policy. (A German NSC has been proposed several times, but it has been voted down by those who\u2014for understandable historical reasons\u2014loathe giving too much power to a chancellor.) Lindner insisted that the defense budget be frozen at 50 billion euros\u2014and the chancellor can\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe irony here is that the FPD won only 11 percent of the vote in the 2021 election. It was invited into the government only because the Social Democratic Party and the Greens, which had hoped to form a coalition of their own, together fell 9.5 percent short of a majority. (The SPD won 25.7 percent; the Greens, 14.8 percent.) Tacking on the FPD gave them a bare majority without having to bring in the CDU (which ranked a close 2nd place in the election, with 24.1 percent of the vote). In other words, defense spending\u2014spending of all sorts\u2014is being held down by a party with a very small following.\n\nStill, a bureaucratic squabble rages on about the military budget. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who has ordered various reforms within the military, is pushing for an increase of $6 billion to $10 billion in the baseline defense budget. Some of his supporters in the Bundestag think he might get $3 billion to $5 billion\u2014which would help a little.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the big lessons of the war in Ukraine is that the security of Europe\u2014old or new\u2014remains dependent on the United States. Without U.S. weapons to Ukraine (worth $37 billion and rising), along with training and the sharing of real-time intelligence of the Russian army\u2019s movements and orders, Kyiv would have fallen long ago. Scholz agreed to send Germany\u2019s Leopard tanks to Ukraine only after President Biden agreed to send the U.S. Army\u2019s Abrams tanks. Europeans stood up to Russian aggression in support of Ukrainian freedom, but they might not have done so, or been able to do so as efficiently or effectively, without leadership from Washington.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has often advocated \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d for Europe, but Scholz has brushed this off as a pipe dream, and not a desirable one in any event\u2014an attitude that has alienated Macron. While most EU leaders agree with Scholz\u2019s dismissal of Macron\u2019s idea, some complain that the chancellor ignores them too, bringing no German ideas to EU conferences. In part, this is because it\u2019s hard for his coalition government to agree on new ideas. In part, it\u2019s because Germans still feel reluctant\u2014a hangover from their post\u2013World War II guilt\u2014to take a leadership role in Europe. But in part it\u2019s also because Scholz prefers to deal with Biden. Except for Macron, this is true of many European leaders, who understand the true locus of their security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe whispered worry in Berlin is that Biden may be the last American president who cares deeply about trans-Atlantic relations\u2014and that the most prominent Republicans seem not to care much at all.\n\nGermany may be the only country with the power and resources to take the reins in hand if Europe has to take up the slack and provide for its own security, but for all the reasons above, this isn\u2019t happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJana Puglierin, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me she\u2019s worried that there\u2019s \u201cno sign of urgency\u201d about the political developments in America. \u201cWe feel protected by the U.S., and there\u2019s no sense that it might vanish someday. Many raised questions about this after 2016 [when Trump became president], but no one did anything. Germany has no Plan B for 2024 if Trump wins again.\n\n\u201cThe war has brought Europe together,\u201d Puglierin continued, \u201cbut it has also exposed these underlying tensions.\u201d She sighed and added, \u201cI wonder if Europe will ever get its act together.\u201d"
