        "content": "Crypto Market News: Brad Garlinghouse, the Ripple chief executive officer, doubted the motive behind the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing two of the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency exchanges. It may be recalled that the US Supreme Court had earlier accepted the motion to consider arguments about cutting down discretionary powers of the federal regulatory agencies. Meanwhile, influential people in the crypto market community are questioning the extent to which the SEC had powers to fight companies legally. When it comes to crypto lawsuits, the XRP holders often show strong support to Ripple, and in this case, the community is calling for market participant unity in the fight against the SEC.\n\nAlso Read: Key Differences In SEC Charges Against Coinbase And Binance\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn recent times, the SEC faced heavy criticism for its failure to catch hold of the discrepancies in the financial condition of FTX exchange, prior to its collapse in November 2022. Hence, the Ripple CEO is pointing to the FTX failure as the real reason behind SEC\u2019s attack on crypto businesses.\n\nSEC \u201cThrowing Lawsuits At The Wall\u201d\n\nGarlinghouse heavily criticized SEC Chairman Gary Gensler for hiding behind lack of powers to go about attacking businesses. He alleged that the lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase are SEC\u2019s ways to distract from its FTX failure.\n\nMeanwhile, further progress in the XRP Vs SEC lawsuit is likely in the next one week when the Hinman documents will be made public.\n\nAlso Read: Cardano (ADA) Selloff Picks Momentum After Been Implicated in Coinbase Crackdown"

        "content": "Poor air quality on the East Coast due to Canadian wildfires is postponing sporting events, as well as causing flight delays in the Midwest, including in Chicago.\n\nOn Wednesday, a ground stoppage at major airports \u2013 like in New York \u2013 created a ripple effect on air travel. Fortunately, the stoppage was short-lived, and operations were gradually resuming.\n\n\"You can\u2019t see which is very surprising when you are sitting in the concourse waiting for your plane, and you can\u2019t see the baggage trucks on the tarmac,\" said Beth, who\u2019s from the Chicago suburbs and was traveling home through New Jersey on Wednesday.\n\n\"Very unearthly looking and you could smell the smoke in the building, even though the building is air-conditioned.\"\n\nAt Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, there were only a few delays reported.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO FOX 32 CHICAGO ON YOUTUBE\n\nAccording to transportation experts, a potential crisis was averted despite major delays in and out of New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. So far, O'Hare and LaGuardia airports have seen only two canceled flights and around two dozen delayed flights.\n\nChicago's Midway Airport has experienced a similar situation.\n\n\"Passengers are expecting the worst when these things happen,\" said Joe Schwieterman, a transportation expert with DePaul University. \"This could be a sign of a sort of new threat or system with these wildfires.\"\n\nThe impact of the poor air quality extends to sports as well. Wednesday night's Yankees-White Sox game has been rescheduled to Thursday afternoon due to the air quality concerns in the Big Apple. This decision prioritizes the well-being and safety of players, staff, and fans alike."

        "content": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently took to Twitter to express his opinion on the recent comments made by Gary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC, regarding digital currencies. In particular, the executive's statement implied that he believes the SEC's authority is limited and that Gensler's actions are a sign of weakness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProminent attorney and digital assets enthusiast Bill Morgan reacted to Garlinghouse's remarks with an interesting observation. Morgan's tweet suggested that the Ripple CEO's confident tone indicates that he is not expecting a negative outcome in the SEC lawsuit against the crypto company. This interpretation of Garlinghouse's words generated hope within the XRP community, which has been closely following the legal proceedings.\n\nNot the words of a man expecting a bad outcome in a lawsuit brought against him by the SEC https://t.co/bxt3PgPlGp \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 6, 2023\n\nThe attorney also addressed the news that Robinhood, a major U.S. broker, may delist certain cryptocurrencies, including ADA, SOL and MATIC, due to the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase and Binance. Morgan drew a parallel to December 2020, when XRP faced a similar situation of legal scrutiny followed by delistings.\n\nMoreover, the attorney continued to criticize Coinbase for its decision to delist XRP and not reintroduce it for trading, despite ongoing pressure from the SEC. He argued that the exchange's actions went beyond restricting Ripple's ability to sell XRP and included blocking all secondary sales of XRP, even those unrelated to Ripple. Nevertheless, Morgan expressed his support for Coinbase's defense against the SEC, believing that the exchange has been treated unfairly."

        "content": "While the cryptocurrency community awaits the release of controversial documents as part of the lawsuit that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed against blockchain company Ripple, a lawyer has highlighted the agency\u2019s lack of evidence to support XRP as an investment contract.\n\nIndeed, legal expert and Ripple\u2019s amicus curiae John E. Deaton had earlier challenged the SEC to produce a single legal precedent that could relate to the case of Ripple and XRP, and the agency had failed to do that, just as he expected it would, he said in a Twitter post shared on June 7.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n\u201cI challenged the SEC in my amicus brief to cite a single case from any court EVER that found an investment contract between a purchaser (e.g. individual XRP holder) and a promoter (e.g. Ripple) when there existed no privity (no contact whatsoever) between that promoter and purchaser. I challenged the SEC to cite a single case because I knew they couldn\u2019t \u2013 And they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Deaton expressed confidence that Ripple would come out victorious in the widely publicized legal standoff, as he commented on the SEC\u2019s \u201cgross overreach,\u201d he expected the US Supreme Court would address, as Finbold reported on February 21.\n\nXRP stands strong\n\nMeanwhile, XRP is one of the few cryptocurrencies that have remained continuously in the green zone amid the drama sparked by the SEC\u2019s lawsuits against crypto trading platforms Binance and Coinbase, while the rest of the crypto market, at best, struggled to retain positive momentum.\n\nIn fact, at press time, it was changing hands at the price of $0.52, demonstrating an increase of 2.07% on the day, as well as growing 20.34% across the previous week and as much as 33.49% on its monthly chart, as per the latest data retrieved on June 7.\n\nOn top of that, XRP looks to be preparing for a \u201cmajor price upswing,\u201d according to the crypto expert Ali Martinez, who referred to the notable spike in the number of new XRP addresses on the blockchain as one of the key indicators of a digital asset\u2019s future price direction."

        "title": "The Future of Asian Continental Club Football: The Ripple Effects of Saudi's Football Investments - Breaking The Lines",
        "content": "When Japan\u2019s Urawa Reds met Saudi football behemoth Al Hilal in the showpiece event of the Asian club football calendar, the Asian Champions League final, many lamented the familiarity that this conclusion has kindled among followers of Asian club football. For the past six seasons, the ACL crown has gone to a side from the J1 League or to Al Hilal.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the level of investment has seen a spike in the general interest in football in Saudi Arabia. Evident of this, research conducted by Twitter in 2020 showed that 73% of Saudis using Twitter, do so with the purpose partly being to follow football. This incline in interest \u2013 exacerbated by the 2022 World Cup in neighbouring Qatar \u2013 has been followed by a surge in domestic football investment by Saudi\u2019s infamous public investment fund (PIF).\n\nIn 2022, Financial Times reported that the PIF had secured sponsorship agreements that amounted to around $2.3 billion and that \u201cmost of the money is for domestic football.\u201d Unlike most sovereign wealth funds, the PIF is seen as separate to the government but has to dual mandate to help further the Saudi economy by pursuing huge financial returns on their many investments. It is estimated that the PIF have assets under management that value up to $600 billion.\n\nIn addition to all of this, Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s arrival at Al Nassr \u2013 and the huge contract he is playing under \u2013 underpins the power and sway that Saudi club football is now carrying. For context, Ronaldo\u2019s annual salary at Al Nassr will exceed the total wage bill for half of the clubs in the English Premier League.\n\nCrucially, European football is taking an approach to bring financial splurging under control. UEFA have announced that the degree to which clubs can spend their total revenue on transfers, wages and agent fees will decrease from 90% of the club\u2019s total revenue to 70% in 2025.\n\nThis has led many to theorise about the potential long-term effects that the injection of capital in Saudi \u2013 and more broadly Asian football \u2013 will have on European clubs and players. As player wages in football are closely tied to revenues, increasing wages based on the demand of non-European clubs has the potential to diminish the quality of squads in European football which would then have a bigger impact on things like brand values, viewership, and, consequently, on-pitch results.\n\nAre the AFC Promoting Competition or Limiting It?\n\nSpeaking to Martin Lowe, writer for The Asian Game, he gives an exclusive insight to Breaking the Lines into the AFC\u2019s plans to reform to ACL, reducing the number of teams and creating a third tier of continental football \u2013 quite similar to UEFA\u2019s introduction of the Europa Conference League. The ACL will be cut from the 40-club format down to 24 \u201celite clubs\u201d that will compete more frequently with each other.\n\n\u201cThe ACL is the bastardized son of a confederation that hasn\u2019t sought to carve out its own future,\u201d Martin tells BTL. \u201cThe obsession with what Europe does has held it back for too long and has been the main causation of this year-after-year fluctuation between formats and schedules.\u201d\n\nThis is alluding to the glaring actuality of this reform; it is a shameless appropriation of the European model of the newly reformed Champions League. Less than a year after UEFA introduce a third tier of European club continental football with the Europa Conference League, the AFC introduce the same concept.\n\nAdditionally, this new format will result in more matches, increasing the likelihood of more drama and overall quality in the ACL, and these matches will be competed by Asia\u2019s biggest clubs.\n\nThe Biggest Downside to This Format\n\nOne of the great running themes through the Asian Champions League, which is vastly different from the UCL, is the propensity for smaller clubs to cause huge upsets and therefore raise their own profiles immensely. In 2021, Tajikistan\u2019s Istiklol proved this by beating Al-Hilal and progressing to the knockout stages, a historic achievement for Central Asian Football. \u201cIn the last couple of years we\u2019ve seen great strides made by clubs in India, Tajikistan, Iraq, Hong Kong and Thailand,\u201d says Martin.\n\nThis season there have been many examples of this development. Before 2021, no Indian side had ever competed in the ACL group stages, FC Goa ended this and while they impressed with their stick-to-itiveness and the brilliant performances by their young goalkeeper, Dheeraj Singh, they only amassed two points in the tournament and there was an undoubted chasm between the competitive level they could play to versus the level of their opposition.\n\nMumbai City, on the other hand, well and truly raised the bar for ISL sides competing in Asian club football this year. Their outstanding performances, under the coaching of English coach, Des Buckingham, led them to two victories in the ACL. The first, and by far most historic, win came against Iraqi side, Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya (Air Force Club) which finished 1-0. And despite the number of foreign players in the ISL that are helping raise the competitiveness of the league, it was Mumbai native Rahul Bheke who came up with the winner for his side in a momentous moment for Indian football.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, this expansion has coincided with the global pandemic which has been felt acutely by Asian football. The experience has been somewhat muted,\u201d Lowe describes. \u201cAnd sadly, AFC\u2019s reform plans will reduce exposure of developing leagues to the confederation\u2019s top-tier competition.\u201d\n\nThis is the real tragedy of the shift in format. The exposure to these leagues will diminish, and therefore the gap between the top clubs in Asia and the rest will only widen with how far removed they are from one another. The danger is that we may not have another side from ASEAN or Central Asia pulling off an upset and disrupting these powerhouses, or at least the likelihood of that happening again will be significantly weakened.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for the ACL?\n\nFirstly, how this reform will pan out is yet to be seen. It\u2019s obvious that the bigger clubs benefit the most from this but it does not mean that there are no successes and developments to be had. When asked about how ASEAN clubs can try to bridge the gap between themselves and the Japanese and Korean clubs who have shown themselves to compete very well in the ACL, Lowe says, \u201cCo-operation, both within the region and across the continent has to be a priority. ASEAN clubs need to produce and market their players better.\u201d\n\nOnce a route to Europe is established, the ecosystem starts to be self-fulfilling; motivation is improved and performances at club and international level develop, leaving the next generation with a better environment to grow into. The first step is to leave any self-interests at the door.\u201d\n\nThis attitude could greatly benefit clubs from all over Asia for whom the dreams of the ACL is becoming less and less grounded in reality. Having an approach focused on engendering a spirit and an environment that young players can develop and that there is a pathway to improve and move onto bigger and better leagues is a success much more grounded in reality and is a far more rewarding success than that of the Saudi clubs\u2019 vision of success, whereby huge injections of capital to buy publicity and notoriety, is king.\n\nBy: Louis Young / @FrontPostPod\n\nFeatured Image: @GabFoligno / Hazem Bader / AFP"
