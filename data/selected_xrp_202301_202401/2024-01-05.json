        "content": "TL;DR\n\n\n\nRipple is set to participate in a significant motion hearing for the Zakinov v Ripple Labs case later this month.\n\nThe case, initiated in May 2018 by XRP holders against Ripple, alleges misleading information and illegal XRP sales as an unregistered security.\n\nAdditionally, Ripple\u2019s well-known legal conflict with the US SEC, starting in December 2020 over unregistered XRP security offerings, is highlighted, with a major trial scheduled for April 23, 2024.\n\nRipple\u2019s Participation in Another Major Case\n\nThe case of Zakinov v Ripple Labs is nearing a significant development, with a motion hearing scheduled for January 11. The session will be held via a Zoom webinar before Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton and aims to approve the form and manner of class notice. Members of the public or media can access the hearing via a designated online link.\n\nThe lawsuit started in May 2018 when a group of XRP holders sued the crypto company, alleging it of providing misleading information and breaching certain laws by selling XRP as an unregistered security. The plaintiff, Vladi Zakinov (hence the name of the case), maintains that he and many others were among the victims.\n\nThe trial has been postponed numerous times in the past several years and is expected to start on April 15, 2024.\n\nRipple\u2019s Infamous Battle With the US SEC\n\nThe case between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is arguably the company\u2019s most popular court battle and one of the trendiest topics in the cryptocurrency industry, and it shares similarities with the above. It all started in December 2020 when the regulator accused Ripple of selling XRP in an unregistered security offering.\n\nRipple scored a major victory in July 2023 after US Federal Judge Analisa Torres ruled that secondary XRP sales did not constitute an offer of investment contracts.\n\nThe firm secured two additional partial victories in the following months when the American magistrates disallowed the SEC to appeal the initial decision and when Ripple\u2019s CEO \u2013 Brad Garlinghouse \u2013 and Executive Chairman \u2013 Chris Larsen \u2013 were cleared of all accusations brought by the agency.\n\nThe grand trial is set for April 23, 2024, with both sides required to comply with necessary procedures before meeting in court. The SEC must file its brief with respect to remedies by March 13, 2024, whereas Ripple must file its opposition by April 12, 2024."

        "content": "The idea behind the new initiative is to bring Ernest Cline\u2019s Ready Player One novel into a multi-world open \u2018metaverse experience.\u2019\n\nMetaverse startup Futureverse, backed by 10T Holdings and Ripple Labs, has unveiled a partnership agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery to bring the Ready Player One franchise to the metaverse.\n\nIn an X thread on Jan. 4, the New Zealand-headquartered startup said it has teamed up with Ready Player One author Ernest Cline to launch a new venture dubbed Readyverse Studios, aimed at integrating major IPs into the metaverse. Dan Farah, the producer of the 2018 Warner Bros. film adaptation of the novel, is also listed as the co-founder of the firm.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to announce that we\u2019ve teamed up with @readyplayerone creator and producer to launch Readyverse Studios to bring leading IP and brands to the metaverse. pic.twitter.com/6sU6FpOSdE \u2014 Futureverse (@futureverse) January 4, 2024\n\nWhile financial and technical details of the initiative were not disclosed, Futureverse says the joint products will be rolled out sometime in 2024 on The Root Network, a distributed ledger that utilizes ROOT tokens for security and governance, and Ripple\u2019s XRP for gas fees. Amid the news, ROOT\u2019s price soared by over 14% to $0.073, according to CoinGecko.\n\nFormed in late 2022, Futureverse raised $54 million in a Series A funding round, led by 10T Holdings with participation from Ripple Labs. Prior to the funding, Futureverse integrated The Root Network with XRPL and supported the XRPL-based non-fungible token standard known as XLS-20 NFT.\n\nReal risks in virtual reality\n\nIn mid-September 2023, NYU Stern\u2019s Center for Business and Human Rights raised concerns around the metaverse, stressing the need for a comprehensive privacy law in response to significant privacy threats. According to a report from NYU\u2019s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights (CBHR), experiences in virtual reality (VR) may result in profound and lasting psychological harm.\n\nBesides privacy issues, lawless virtual spaces open limitless opportunities for abusers. Even physical assault in the metaverse can harm from a psychological point of view, as people immersed in a virtual reality world have the sensation that \u201cwhat they are experiencing is real,\u201d the report claims.\n\nThe report suggests that Congress should pass a \u201ccomprehensive privacy law\u201d to protect consumer privacy and limit the use of body-based data. It also urges the government to reinforce the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s mandate to protect consumers against \u201cunfair and deceptive practices by technology companies\u201d and to form a federal body tasked with this mandate."

        "title": "Lifetime of Achievement: Brad Garlinghouse - FinTech Magazine",
        "content": "Brad Garlinghouse undoubtedly ranks as one of the best-known and most influential fintech leaders in the world.\n\nIn truth, this is a man who needs little introduction thanks to his impact at Ripple, the company on a mission to build breakthrough crypto solutions for a world without economic borders.\n\nThat\u2019s without mentioning his impressive contributions to various other big names over the past couple of decades, including Yahoo!, AOL and Hightail (formerly YouSendIt), to name a few.\n\nWhat has become clear, especially in recent times, is that Garlinghouse was surely destined to make his mark on an industry that continues to shape the way our society functions, both today and for years to come.\n\nDestined to change the world\n\nBorn in Kansas\u2019 state capital Topeka, Brad Garlinghouse developed an interest in technology from a young age, when his father brought home a TRS 80 computer \u2013 exposing him to the wonders of computing and programming.\n\nHeading off to college, Garlinghouse achieved his bachelor\u2019s degree in economics at the University of Kansas and retains a great affinity for the institution to this day.\n\nThis includes following the fortunes and misfortunes of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful university basketball teams in US history.\n\nAfter graduating, Garlinghouse earned his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1997, ensuring he had a solid foundation to succeed as a professional, before making the brave move to Silicon Valley in pursuit of a career beyond the norm (at the time).\n\nSpeaking to Kansas University\u2019s KU College Stories site in 2016, he said: \u201cLong before joining Ripple, I knew I wanted to be a part of something that could change the world. We\u2019re living in an amazing time, when almost anyone can say that and mean it.\n\n\u201cI never wanted to work somewhere that was focused on doing things the way they\u2019ve always been done. I discovered that I always want to be looking for the next thing, rather than getting comfortable in what I\u2019m doing today.\u201d\n\nMaking a name for himself\n\nGarlinghouse\u2019s initial endeavours in the world of work saw him take up positions at @Home Network, a high-speed internet cable provider, and @Ventures, a venture capital firm that invested in early-stage tech companies.\n\nFollowing a stint as CEO at Dialpad, he joined Yahoo! in 2003 to become SVP for the Communications, Community and Front Doors. This meant looking after the Homepage, Flickr, Yahoo! Mail, and Yahoo! Messenger divisions, all of which were enjoying a huge surge in popularity.\n\nIt was during his tenure at Yahoo! that Garlinghouse \u2013 who was already making a name for himself \u2013 authored the \u2018Peanut Butter Manifesto\u2019, which became famous and was replicated across the industry.\n\nIn it, he called for the organisation to focus on its core business, rather than spreading itself too thin \u2013 like peanut butter.\n\nGarlinghouse opted for a change of scenery in 2009, moving to one of Yahoo!\u2019s biggest competitors in the form of AOL, where he was President of Applications and Commerce.\n\nHe then served as CEO at the file-sharing site, YouSendIt, but departed in the autumn of 2014 after a disagreement with the board. Were it not for this falling out, Garlinghouse may never have made Ripple the fintech pioneer it is today.\n\nThe Ripple effect\n\nItching to try something new, Garlinghouse joined Ripple to become the startup\u2019s President and COO, despite having minimal experience in the payments sector.\n\nAppearing on the Jay Kim Show, he later recounted that Co-founder and then-CEO Chris Larsen had wanted somebody from \u201coutside the system\u201d to look at things differently.\n\nGarlinghouse\u2019s outsider\u2019s perspective proved invaluable and he was officially promoted to the top job at the beginning of 2017, replacing Larsen.\n\nBy 2019, the natural-born leader had taken Ripple to new heights, in large part thanks to a US$200m Series C funding round which included investment from Tetragon, SBI Ventures and Route 66 Ventures.\n\nToday, Garlinghouse is, in his own words, leading Ripple towards realising its vision of the \u201cinternet of value\u201d, unleashing \u201cpossibilities for digital assets\u201d.\n\nHe is one of the fintech sector\u2019s most outspoken advocates for crypto and blockchain, and, spearheaded by its native XRP cryptocurrency, Ripple continues to develop innovative financial products and solutions.\n\nCustomers are using these solutions to source crypto, facilitate instant payments, empower their treasury, engage new audiences, lower capital requirements and drive new revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s thanks to Garlinghouse and his adaptability, that Ripple has become a key player in the fintech space and looks set to stay at the forefront of this rapidly-evolving sector.\n\n\u201cWe are all products of our experiences, good and bad,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2013. \u201cSometimes you learn as much from the negative experiences as you do from the positive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n**************\n\n\n\nMake sure you check out the latest edition of FinTech Magazine and also sign up to our global conference series - FinTech LIVE 2024\n\n**************\n\nFinTech Magazine is a BizClik brand \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b"
