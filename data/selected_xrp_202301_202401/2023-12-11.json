        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCrypto blogger Colin Wu has reported that Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings (also major partner of Ripple Labs in Japan) announced its plans to begin cooperating with the world\u2019s second-largest company by market capitalization Saudi Aramco.\n\nAramco is also known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Group. Their plan is to set up a new company and promote digital assets and startups dealing with them in Saudi Arabia. In his tweet, Wu cited an article by xtech.nikkei.\n\nGlobal giants team up to extend crypto startups from Japan to Saudi Arabia\n\nRecently, SBI made an announcement about signing an agreement with Saudi Aramco to begin collaborating in the near future. They intend to build factories for producing semiconductors in Saudi Arabia and Japan.\n\nAnother subject of their agreement is digital assets \u2013 they plan to invest in the sphere of digital assets, as well as discover and provide support to Japanese crypto startups which would like to expand their business activities into Saudi Arabia through \u201cSBI Middle East\u201d.\n\nSBI, Japan\u2019s largest cryptocurrency financial group, and Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s second-largest company, announced that they will consider co-investing in each other\u2019s digital asset portfolios. SBI plans to set up \u201cSBI Middle East\u201d in Riyadh to promote Japanese digital asset\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 11, 2023\n\nSBI Group has been establishing new partnerships with companies in the Middle East. It is already working in collaboration with Taiwan-based Power Crystal Manufacturing in the field of semiconductor production.\n\nSBI partners with Circle to utilize USDC\n\nAs covered by U.Today earlier, SBI also inked a strategic partnership with Circle, the issuer of USDC dollar-pegged stablecoin, the second largest by market capitalization value in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe goal of this partnership is to modernize the financial landscape in the country of the rising sun and boost the utility of USDC in Asia overall.\n\nThe decision to penetrate the Japanese market was made after the government made a revision of the Payment Services Act in June this year and set firm regulatory rules for stablecoins in Japan.\n\nJapan intends to gradually get its economy on Web3 tracks and so with the revision of the act they intend to stimulate both creation and circulation of stablecoins in the country.\n\nUSDC is fully backed by US dollars, which are stored on separate bank accounts in order to avoid repeating what happened to FTX in November last year.\n\nSBI and Circle have signed a memo to ensure the start of their collaboration in the future."

        "title": "German Central Bank Report Highlights Ripple and XRP - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "A Deutsche Bundesbank report mentions Ripple and XRP as innovations in the payment landscape for service providers.\n\n#Ripple mentioned in July Bundesbank repor. Notice the \"bilateral credit relationships\" with addition for #XRP use. Notes SEC, volatility, etc. Interestingly, they also note counterparty risk, which isn't the case with #XRP. https://t.co/I5R6UEI2xn pic.twitter.com/yBYw7Y3JcG \u2014 WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) December 9, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA recent report published by Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, has highlighted Ripple\u2019s potential to disrupt the financial landscape. Released in July, the report broadly discusses innovation in the global financial system, noting, among other things, how the rise of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain reduces friction for cross-border transfers.\n\nThe Deutsche Bundesbank report cites Ripple as an example in a section discussing DLT-based money forms and infrastructure. In an apparent allusion to RippleNet, which Ripple recently rebranded as Ripple Payments, the central bank report acknowledged the efficiency at which the network brings together payment service providers.\n\nPrecisely, the report cites Ripple Payment\u2019s ability to provide a \u201crecourse to bilateral credit relationships.\u201d Using its on-demand liquidity (ODL) solution, Ripple extends credit to customers, allowing them to move funds without pre-funding as in the traditional finance world.\n\nThe Deutsche Bundesbank article also mentions that customers may use XRP on the network. However, it acknowledges that the use of the cryptocurrency may entail legal, counterparty, and exchange rate risks. The report explained that Ripple\u2019s ongoing lawsuit with the United States securities regulator and XRP\u2019s volatile nature makes it less ideal for certain payment use cases.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBanks Acknowleges Ripple\u2019s Global Payments Solution\n\nThe latest development follows a pattern of praise for Ripple\u2019s innovation in the payment field by leading banks globally. In October, the Nigerian central bank cited Ripple in a report exploring CBDC and global payments.\n\nSimilarly, in separate reports, the Bank of America and Deutsche Bank lauded Ripple as a solution to frictions facing global remittances. While the Bank of America edition focuses on payment innovation in the Asia Pacific, Deutsche Bank\u2019s report explains how XRP provides the bridge for moving assets on the RippleNet.\n\nThe foregoing acknowledgments evidently underline the relevance of Ripple\u2019s payment solution. It also hints at the potential for additional banking partnerships with a view to promoting the widespread adoption of Ripple\u2019s products."

        "title": "Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions, Bitcoin (BTC) Volatility, Bonk Inu (BONK) Rollercoaster: Bits Recap Dec 11 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Volatility: After surpassing $44,000, Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped below $42,000, causing over $400 million in liquidations. On-chain metrics indicate potential for reduced volatility. BONK\u2019s Success: Bonk Inu (BONK) experienced significant growth, rising 400% monthly and surpassing major memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Ripple\u2019s (XRP) Positive Trend: XRP\u2019s price recently approached $0.70, and despite a slight drop, analysts predict a rise to around $0.75-$0.80.\n\nBTC\u2019s Price Swings\n\nEver since the beginning of December, the cryptocurrency market has been booming, indicating that the highly successful year for the industry could have a happy end. Numerous leading digital assets charted yearly highs, whereas the overall bullish sentiment among investors hinted about further surges.\n\nBitcoin surpassed $44,000 for the first time since the spring of 2022, while the global crypto market capitalization shot above $1.7 trillion (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nIn a sudden twist of events, though, the primary digital asset took a U-turn a few hours ago, with its price dropping below $42,000. This resulted in over $400 million worth of liquidated positions, with BTC trades contributing for over $100 million of that amount.\n\nStill, some on-chain metrics suggest that Bitcoin\u2019s valuation could soon consolidate at its current level. As revealed by CryptoQuant, BTC open interest dropped to almost $10.5 billion on December 10, which usually hints at reduced volatility. In comparison, the metric skyrocketed above $11.6 billion last week.\n\nBONK Steals the Show\n\nDespite the ongoing market decline, some assets are still well in the green, with Bonk Inu (BONK) being one example. The Solana memecoin has jumped around 9% in the past 24 hours and a whopping 400% on a monthly basis.\n\nIt also hit an all-time high (ATH) price on December 9 when its market capitalization reached almost $900 million.\n\nCurrently, BONK is the 83rd largest cryptocurrency in the entire realm, performing much better than the largest memecoins by market cap, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nRipple (XRP) Price Bets\n\nRipple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 is another crypto asset that had quite a favorable week. Its price ascended to almost $0.70 over the weekend but dropped significantly over the last 24 hours to its current mark of $0.62.\n\nHowever, some analysts, including the X (Twitter) users EGRAG CRYPTO and Dark Defender, believe XRP could finish the ongoing year at a higher level. The former claimed the asset might climb to $0.75, whereas the latter sees it jumping toward $0.80 in the following weeks.\n\nThose willing to check additional XRP price forecasts for the short term could take a look at our dedicated video below:"

        "content": "Bitcoin price could lose critical support at $40,000 as RSI confirms BTC is ripe for selling.\n\nEthereum price clings firm to the uptrend and records a healthy pullback as $2,147 support continues to hold.\n\nRipple price risks an extended 7% fall to the $0.5773 support level as XRP bulls show weakness.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains bullish despite the catastrophic setback recorded during the early trading hours of the Asian session. While several other narratives support the big-picture bullish outlook, spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have a role to play in it.\n\nAs traders and investors continue to anticipate the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) giving approvals for the product launches between January 5 and 10, even Google has taken a hint. An official announcement reveals that \"advertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States [will be allowed] to advertise those products and services\" beginning January 29, 2024. Notably, this is the same month that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to gain approval in the US.\n\nBitcoin price delivers a healthy retest\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price folding back to record an intra-day low of $40,400 was a healthy retest as the $40,000 psychological level continues to hold as support. If the level holds, then it could precipitate the idea that new all-time highs are in the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, the upside potential remains strong for Bitcoin price as BTC is still not ripe for selling until the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crosses below the 70 level. With the Awesome Oscillator (AO) showing large volumes of green histogram bars, the bulls still maintain a strong presence in the market though. The RSI could simply hold above 70.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price overcome the weekly supply zone extending from $40,698 to $46,999. A weekly candlestick close above the $43,860 mean threshold would confirm the continuation of the primary trend.\n\nSuch a move would set the tone for Bitcoin price to flip the supply zone into a bullish breaker, confirmed by a move above the $48,725 resistance level.In a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could extend to tag the $66,098 resistance level into a support floor.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, if the weekly supply zone defends as a resistance order block, Bitcoin price could pull south, losing the support at $40,000. A decisive weekly candlestick close below this level would put BTC on the cliff, potentially rolling over to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin braces for volatility-filled week with November CPI data release, Fed decision\n\nEthereum price sell-off threatens upside potential\n\nEthereum (ETH) price also crashed alongside Bitcoin, losing almost 9% in market value. However, the move remains a healthy pullback as the $2,147 support level did not break. As long as ETH remains above the $2,000 psychological level, the upside potential remains alive.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Ethereum price clear the $2,403 range high even as it continues to consolidate within the confines of an ascending parallel channel.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, increased seller momentum could plunge Ethereum price out of the bullish chart pattern, confirmed by a break and close below critical $2,147 support. ETH might then confirm the continuation of the fall by breaking and closing below the midline of the supply zone turned bullish breaker at $2,075. The move could clear the path for the largest altcoin by market capitalization to spiral to the $2,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum leads altcoins north as Bitcoin halts amid bull trap fears"

        "title": "Iraq struggles to contain ripple effects of Gaza war as Iran-backed groups attack U.S. troops - PBS NewsHour",
        "content": "BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Dozens of attacks on U.S. military facilities by Iran-backed factions in Iraq over the past two months as the Israel-Hamas war has raged have forced Baghdad into a balancing act that\u2019s becoming more difficult by the day.\n\nA rocket attack on the sprawling U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Friday marked a further escalation as Iraqi officials scramble to contain the ripple effects of the latest Middle East war.\n\nREAD MORE: A rocket attack targets the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, causing minor damage but no casualties\n\nIran holds considerable sway in Iraq and a coalition of Iran-backed groups brought Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to power in October 2022. At the same time, there are some 2,000 U.S. troops in Iraq under an agreement with Baghdad, mainly to counter the militant Islamic State group.\n\nBaghdad also relies heavily on Washington\u2019s sanctions waivers to buy electricity from Iran, and since the 2003 U.S. invasion, Iraq\u2019s foreign currency reserves have been housed at the U.S. Federal Reserve, giving the Americans significant control over Iraq\u2019s supply of dollars.\n\nAl-Sudani\u2019s predecessors also had to walk a delicate line between Tehran and Washington, but the Israel-Hamas war has considerably upped the stakes.\n\nSince the war erupted on Oct. 7, at least 91 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria have been claimed by an umbrella group of Iran-backed Iraqi militants dubbed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. The militants say their attacks are in retaliation for Washington\u2019s backing of Israel and its military presence in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAl-Sudani has condemned the attacks and U.S. counter-strikes as a violation of his country\u2019s sovereignty. He has also ordered authorities to pursue militants involved in the attacks, most of which caused no injuries and only minor damage. His office declined further comment.\n\nWashington has sent messages that its patience is wearing thin.\n\nAfter the embassy attack, the Pentagon said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin \u201cmade clear (to al-Sudani) that attacks against U.S. forces must stop.\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told al-Sudani that Washington expects Iraqi officials to take more action to prevent such attacks, and believes they have the capability to do so, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.\n\nDuring a recent trip to the region, CIA Director William Burns warned al-Sudani of \u201charsh consequences\u201d if Iraq doesn\u2019t act to stop the attacks, an Iraqi official said.\n\nBoth officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations.\n\nIn a call with the Iraqi premier earlier this month, Blinken said that Americans would take matters into their own hands, arguing that Baghdad had not done enough to pursue the perpetrators, according to two Iraqi officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nTwo days later, a U.S. strike on a drone launch site near the Iraqi city of Kirkuk killed five militants.\n\nThe U.S. and much of the international community have scrambled to prevent the war in the besieged Gaza Strip from expanding across the region.\n\nAnalyst Renad Mansour said he believes Iran is making sure the attacks remain below a threshold that would provoke a major U.S. response.\n\nWATCH: Pentagon says air base in Iraq sustained minor damage after attempted attack\n\n\u201cBoth Iran and Iraq have maintained thus far a clear line that, at the moment, Iraq cannot turn into a playground that could destabilize the Sudani government,\u201d said Mansour, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House think tank.\n\nHe said that\u2019s partially due to Iraq\u2019s role of passing messages between Washington and Tehran.\n\nSometimes the messenger is al-Sudani.\n\nIn early November, Blinken met with al-Sudani in Baghdad a day before the Iraqi prime minister was set to visit Tehran. Al-Sudani had won a specific promise from the militias that no attacks would be launched during Blinken\u2019s visit, according to an Iraqi official and a member of the Kataib Hezbollah militia. Following the visit, al-Sudani carried a message from Blinken to Iran to restrain the militias.\n\nBoth officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nA week after the Iraqi premier\u2019s diplomatic efforts, the United States extended Iraq\u2019s sanctions waiver by four months to purchase Iranian electricity. Iran-hawks in Washington criticized the move, saying it would shore up revenue for Tehran while its proxies are at war with Israel.\n\nMansour says Washington has used the sanctions waiver as \u201cone of its cards\u201d in economy-centered efforts to pressure Iran and Iraq.\n\nUnlike Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group, seen as Iran\u2019s most powerful proxy in the region, Iraq\u2019s militias have so far only played a limited role in the conflict.\n\nFor now, only small number of militiamen from Iraq are in southern Lebanon, near Israel\u2019s northern border, said the official from the Kataib Hezbollah group. He said the Iraqis are working on \u201cbattle management\u201d alongside Hezbollah and representatives of Hamas, the militant group that has ruled Gaza for 16 years and is currently battling Israel.\n\nHe said Iran-backed groups in Iraq don\u2019t want the conflict to spread across the region, but are prepared to respond with force to any attacks.\n\nShould Iran and allies choose to escalate, al-Sudani\u2019s government will likely be unable to rein them in or prevent consequences on Iraqi soil, said Iyad al-Anbar, a political science professor at Baghdad University.\n\n\u201cAnd this is why all al-Sudani has been able to do is try to bring some calm through statements,\u201d said al-Anbar.\n\nChehayeb reported from Beirut. Associated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report."
