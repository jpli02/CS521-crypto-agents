We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Ripple, the trailblazing blockchain company specializing in international transfers, executed a mysterious transfer of 46.34 million XRP tokens worth approximately $24.75 million. The transaction, as reported by Whale Alert, involved the movement of these substantial funds from Ripple's official address to an undisclosed wallet identified as \"rP4X2.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe enigmatic wallet, first activated in October of the previous year with an initial transfer of 70 million XRP, has gained attention due to its characteristic large volume of transactions. Currently, it holds almost 50.7 million XRP, raising questions about its significance within the broader Ripple ecosystem.\n\nXRP price outlook\n\nSimultaneously, as Ripple carries out this unexpected maneuver, the XRP token's market performance hangs in the balance. Recent weeks have witnessed a downturn in the token's value, bringing it to a critical level of dynamic support dating back to January of the preceding year.\n\nHistorically, this juncture has acted as a reliable point of recovery for XRP; however, the current market conditions, characterized by uncertainty and fear, make predicting the token's trajectory a challenging task.\n\nThe looming month of February, just two days away, historically holds ominous undertones for the XRP price. While favorable market conditions could potentially favor XRP finding a local bottom at its current support level, the prevailing ambiguity in the market suggests a cautious approach.\n\nInvestors and XRP enthusiasts should pay close attention to these developments, as the mysterious transfer of millions of tokens adds an additional layer of intrigue to an already uncertain market landscape."

        "title": "Ripple Offloads 46 Mln XRP Tokens Amid Price Rebound, Nosedive Ahead? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ripple\u2019s XRP has experienced a significant rebound today, erasing losses from the previous week. However, the XRP community is unsettled by significant selloffs and notable whale movements, further contributing to market uncertainty. Adding to the unease, Ripple has executed a substantial transfer of 46 million XRP tokens lately. This raised concerns about another impending selloff amid heightened volatility.\n\nRipple Dumps Massive XRP Reserve\n\nA recent post on X by Whale Alert, an on-chain tracking platform, brought attention to this massive XRP transaction carried out via its parent company, Ripple. The sizable transfer has sent shockwaves through the community, with expectations of a considerable selloff that could potentially drive the XRP price lower despite the recent rebound.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Whale Alert post suggests that Ripple has offloaded 46.34 million XRP tokens, valued at $24.74 million. The transaction was directed toward an undisclosed wallet. Moreover, according to data from Bithomp, an XRP ledger explorer, Ripple currently holds an extremely small XRP reserve now. Ripple currently holds just 270 XRP tokens, equivalent to $147. However, there are strong chances that Ripple might buy XRP to boost its reserve in the future.\n\nAdding to the dynamics, another major whale transaction has been reported by Whale Alert. This transaction involved the transfer of 27.10 million XRP tokens, equivalent to $14.57 million, to Bitstamp, a crypto exchange. The transfer was conducted via an unidentified wallet. Moreover, the recurrence of significant selloff moves in these transactions raises further concerns within the XRP community as the crypto price has just rebounded past $0.53.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple Vs SEC: XRP Lawyer John Deaton Gears Up To Share Exclusive Insights\n\nXRP Price Action\n\nThe XRP price recently climbed the $0.53 mark as the crypto market witnessed a shift to the green ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting. As of writing, XRP traded at $0.533, gaining 1.03% on Tuesday, January 30. The crypto held a market valuation of $28.98 billion, up 1.01%.\n\nMoreover, the 24-hour trading volume for XRP boosted by a massive 33.73% to $909.06 million. Furthermore, the XRP crypto price soared from a bottom of $0.5206 to a peak of $0.5396 during the day. However, according to XRP Captain, an XRP supporter and crypto analyst, the XRP price is poised to drop below $0.50 soon.\n\nThis prediction aligns with the concerns regarding the recent major sell-offs. On the contrary, he also noted that the price crash event would take place before XRP experienced a Falling Wedge breakout. In addition, XRP Captain noted that the XRP price would surpass the $0.64 after the breakout.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Whale Offloads 27 Mln Tokens to Bitstamp, Will XRP Price Drop Below $0.50?"

        "title": "SpaceX Rocket Causes Moon to Ripple in Photographer's Fantastic Image - PetaPixel",
        "content": "A photographer captured a thundering photo of a Falcon Heavy SpaceX rocket passing in front of the Moon \u2014 making the edges of Earth\u2019s satellite look as if they\u2019re rippling.\n\nSteven Madow\u2019s photo was years in the making and took extensive, precision planning that saw him rock up in a \u201crandom parking lot\u201d in a small city close to the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nMadow had made attempts to get the photo in late 2022 when the Artemis mission blasted off to go around the Moon and again in February 2023 when he was close but no cigar. But on December 28, 2023, Madow nailed the shot.\n\n\u201cFor the planning, I realized a day or so before the launch that Moonrise was about 40 minutes before the launch,\u201d Madow tells PetaPixel.\n\n\u201cA Moon right on the horizon would make a shot like this easier to plan since the rocket wouldn\u2019t be as high up. The higher it goes, the more challenging it is to understand the trajectory and line it up with the Moon.\n\n\u201cSo, to get an idea of where to stand, I started off with TPE (The Photographer\u2019s Ephemeris) and roughly lined up where the Moon would be compared to the launchpad.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom there, I was able to input some trial GPS coordinates into a platform called Flightclub.io. This website is normally used to plan long exposure nighttime launch photos (like this one that was previously featured on PetaPixel),\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy enough \u2014 input your location, your focal length, and the launch, and it will simulate how the rocket streak will look!\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, in addition to planning the long exposure shot, with some more advanced usage, it is possible to input an extreme focal length and use the prediction to line things up with the Moon,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAll of this coming together required the math behind this program to be precise. It\u2019s incredibly challenging for the developer to get it right to this level of accuracy because he is limited to public data.\n\n\u201cAnd in the case of this launch, nothing was in our favor. It was a brand new trajectory that this rocket had never flown, a top-secret Space Force launch (meaning less data available), and the Moon was relatively high up.\n\n\u201cOn top of all that, the available locations where things could line up were either not accessible (not public land) or had tons of trees that could block the Moon.\u201d\n\nDespite all the hurdles, the shot worked out. The Moon rose above the tall trees just five minutes before the launch and when it perfectly crossed the lunar surface Madow says he screamed with joy at the top of his lungs.\n\nMadow set up four cameras in total across several hundred feet of latitude. Three of them were filming video with only one getting a great shot (see GIF below) where the air disturbance is clearly visible.\n\nTo capture the photo, Madow used a Panasonic LUMIX G9 II with a PanaLeica 100-400mm lens (at 400mm) and the shutter set to 1/1000 \u2014 the photo is just one single exposure.\n\n\u201cI shot on my fastest burst mode (14 frames per second) and tested the buffer to know how long I could shoot. This camera was just released in late 2023 and it performs extremely well in this regard,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cEverything was locked down on fully manual settings (including focus). I decided to underexpose for the Moon by a stop or two and figured that the rocket would be nicely silhouetted.\n\n\u201cAmazingly, many people think that it was faked and that makes me like it even more. It is one of my least processed images and I was so happy to pull it off as a single shot.\u201d\n\nWhat Causes the Moon to Ripple?\n\nMadow\u2019s photo was selected as NASA\u2019s Astronomy Picture of the Day; the space agency explains that the Moon ripples because of pockets of hot air emitted from the rocket deflecting moonlight less strongly than the pickets of cool air.\n\nThe rocket in the photo was part of the USSF-52 mission with the Falcon Heavy rocket carrying the X-37B \u2014 the U.S. military\u2019s secretive X-37B robot spaceplane. The Boeing-built vehicle, roughly the size of a small bus and resembling a miniature space shuttle, is built to deploy various payloads and conduct technology experiments on years-long orbital flights.\n\nMore of Madow\u2019s work can be found on his website, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nImage credits: Photographs by Steven Madow."
