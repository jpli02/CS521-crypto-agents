You have to watch the times. Work times. You know 7-8 o'clock in the morning, at nighttime and around 4:30-5 o'clock. The re-routing of traffic is a lot. Hard to back out. Hard to get through things,\" said Slusher.\n\nSlusher said she believes crews are working as fast as they can to get the job done.\n\n\"We're glad that they're upgrading things. We really love Broad Ripple, but it's been a challenge,\" said Slusher.\n\nSlusher's husband said improvements are needed.\n\n\"It's an inconvenience but at the same time it's well worth it. A lot of positive changes in the area,\" said Jay Slusher.\n\nFloverg wants her neighbors to be safe and is calling on DPW to provide more.\n\n\"Someone directing traffic or just a better way to like add a detour that's not through a residential neighborhood where kids and people live,\" she said."

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe price of Ripple (XRP) exploded back in July after an American judge ruled that the asset was not a security in certain cases.\n\nIt has now erased those gains and is currently one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies over the past week.\n\nXRP at the time of writing was trading for $0.48, according to CoinGecko. That's a 8% drop in value in seven days.\n\nThe asset boomed following the court ruling and touched as high as $.0.82. Institutional investors plugged cash into the asset and Ripple's General Counsel Stu Alderoty said he expected U.S. banks to go back to using the fintech firm\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut it has since dropped by more than 40%.\n\nBack in 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hit Ripple with a $1.3 billion lawsuit, alleging that it had misled investors and sold unregistered securities in the form of XRP.\n\nBut a federal district judge in July wrote in a partial ruling that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors did not qualify as securities.\n\nEven though the judge said that $728 million-worth of contracts for institutional sales did constitute unregistered securities sales, investors\u2014and Ripple Labs\u2014interpreted the ruling as positive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAbout institutional sales, Torres wrote: \"Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding the Institutional Sales, the Court concludes that Ripple\u2019s Institutional Sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.\"\n\nIn the days after the ruling, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said said that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Judge Torres' decision. He added at the time, in July, that the commission was, \u201clooking at it and assessing that option,\" when asked about filing an appeal.\n\nThe fintech company behind the asset, Ripple Labs, was launched to help banks and other financial institutions move money fast and with very low fees.\n\nXRP is still over 85% down from its 2018 all-time high of $3.40."

        "title": "\u2018Ripple Is The Internet Of Value\u2019 Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Says In Recovered Video | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The competition between Ripple and Ethereum has been a long-running one given the capabilities of both networks. This was further exacerbated by the fact that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chose to bring a lawsuit against Ripple over XRP being allegedly a security but the same was not done about Ethereum\u2019s ETH token.\n\nBoth communities have since been at loggerheads with each one trying to prove that they\u2019re better than the other. As a result of this, a video from 2014 has been dug up where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin seems to be praising Ripple.\n\n\u2018Ripple Is The Internet Of Value\u2019\n\nIn the video that was posted by X (formerly Twitter) user @NerdNationUnbox, Buterin seems to be very convinced about the value proposition of Ripple. The setting which suggests a talk at an event featured a young Vitalik Buterin talking about what Ethereum is really about.\n\nThe 14-second video seems to be focused on the \u2018internet of value\u2019 which the Ethereum founder explained that people often think Ethereum is about. However, as he explained, Ethereum is not the internet of value. Rather, the founder said that Ripple is actually the internet of value.\n\nInternet of value is actually a concept that was presented by Ripple which looked to build an Internet that makes it easy for people to transfer any asset of value seamlessly between themselves. It consists of any asset that could be valuable including information, internet currencies, stocks, etc, to be transferred instantly to someone.\n\nEthereum Founder Really A Fan Of XRP?\n\nSteven Nerayoff who has become widely known in crypto circles as the \u2018Ethereum Whistleblower\u2019 is back once again and going for Vitalik Buterin. In an October 13 post, Nerayoff tagged Buterin, whom he describes with #CryptoJudas, saying that he actually wanted to be XRP.\n\nNerayoff attached a screenshot of a deleted tweet from the Ethereum founder talking about XRP as sound money. \u201cBut he\u2019s so shy he deleted his tweet which is in this article stating that XRP is \u2018better sound money than Bitcoin\u2019,\u201d Nerayoff wrote.\n\nSource: X\n\nHowever, as other X users have pointed out, Buterin seemed to actually be making fun of XRP in the tweet. Responding to another user who presented Bitcoin as sound money, Buterin said \u201cThe chart for XRP/XRP would look the same\u201d, but his use of \u2018TM\u2019 with the terms Institutional adoption and Partnerships suggests he was not being serious as this has been an established way to joke about something on the internet.\n\nNevertheless, the post is still very open to interpretation and there have been responses from both sides. One Ripple community member stated:\n\nThis is the same guy who a few months earlier was rejoicing when XRP was attacked by the SEC, he also was angry that Chris Larsen had suggested the Chinese had too much influence in BTC and ETH. XRP really hit a nerve not because we were wrong, but because we could see through his scammy games.\n\nXRP mounts impressive recovery | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from The Cryptocurrency Post, chart from Tradingview.com"
