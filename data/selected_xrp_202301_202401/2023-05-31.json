        "content": "Wed 31 May 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C.\n\nHinman\u2019s emails, the former head of the SEC, are crucial in its lawsuit against Ripple. It is believed that they could contain the evidence that settles the debate on the nature of XRP, Ripple\u2019s native asset. However, access to these emails has been blocked by the court. But this lock could potentially be fully lifted.\n\nInevitable access to Hinman\u2019s emails according to Ripple\n\nAttorney John Deaton and David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technical Officer, have once again spoken out about the Ripple vs. SEC case. This intervention particularly concerns Hinman\u2019s emails, the former SEC chairman.\n\nIn an interview on Monday, May 29, the two Ripple supporters shared their perspectives on these potential pieces of evidence. They believe that they should inevitably be made public, even in the event of an agreement between the two parties.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Hinman\u2019s emails are not insignificant elements in the SEC vs Ripple case. They potentially have the ability to shed light on the true nature of XRP. It is around this aspect that the trial\u2019s debates have revolved.\n\nAt the moment, the outcome of the case is eagerly anticipated. But Deaton and Schwartz believe that Hinman\u2019s emails should be fully declassified, even though the court\u2019s decision on the matter only allows for partial declassification of the emails.\n\nThe intervention of these two experts does not clearly indicate the reasons behind this firm stance. However, the interpretation suggests that popular and especially media pressure would play a role in this dynamic.\n\nIndeed, some journalists had requested access to Hinman\u2019s emails from the court. Their request was denied, but it could be granted as media pressure intensifies.\n\nMoreover, certain crypto firms may also want to access the same information in the context of their own lawsuits against the SEC. This would be a useful step to prepare their defense. Coinbase has already expressed clear intentions in this regard.

        "title": "BC doctors: resources affecting patient care - CityNews Vancouver",
        "content": "As more doctors come forward with warnings about a dire shortage of resources in some of B.C.\u2019s busiest hospitals, some specialists are speaking out about the ripple effect on patient care.\n\nCityNews spoke with a specialized surgeon, who agreed to speak to CityNews on the condition of anonymity, who suggests some colleagues are actually turning away a majority of referrals because they can\u2019t get proper support for their patients.\n\nThe surgeon works at a hospital within the Vancouver Coastal Health region and says staffing shortages and a lack of resources at hospitals in neighbouring Fraser Health are a major concern, but a lack of funding and support for hospitalists is also a huge problem right across the region as contract talks with the \u201chouse doctors\u201d are ongoing.\n\nHospitalists are the doctors \u2014 general practitioners \u2014 who work within hospitals and coordinate care for patients outside of the emergency room. If you are transferred out of the emergency room, it is a hospitalist who takes charge, and some specialists feel an erosion of that role leaves a gap in care.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest issues is the fact that our administrative/managerial staff continues to grow, but without meaningful engagement or with front-line staff. Specialists, for example, know what our patients need, but we are constantly being strong-armed into providing care that is contrary to what is in the best interest of our patients,\u201d the surgeon told CityNews, suggesting the situation is more dire than what has been made public.\n\n\u201cSome specialists have to turn away [the] majority of referrals due to inadequate resources to support patients we take on. It takes a massive emotional toll to know that you have the expertise to help patients in dire need, but have no way to care for these patients, due to lack of resources,\u201d the surgeon said.\n\nThey believe the situation is even worse in Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) authority hospitals than others in the region, but others may soon catch up.\n\n\u201cPart of the issue is that Fraser Health wants to downgrade hospitalist service similar to what we have at VCH, which essentially amounts to less hospitalist services and funding. We actually worse off here \u2014 for now. In essence, health authorities are in competition with one another to find the lowest common denominator.\u201d\n\nThe specialist says there has even been discussion around dismantling some of the specialized health care units at their hospital.\n\n\u201cAll of the above definitely leads to poor outcomes as well as irreparable burnout and mental health deterioration amongst health care staff. There\u2019s so much that is so wrong at present,\u201d they added.\n\nFor weeks now, groups of healthcare providers have been speaking out through open letters, describing what they see as critical shortages of frontline resources in facilities like Surrey Memorial Hospital (SMH), Royal Columbian Hospital (RCH) in New Westminster, and Eagle Ridge Hospital in Port Moody.\n\nHealthcare crisis gets the political treatment\n\nPoliticians are blasting the province for what, they feel, is a lack of leadership on the growing healthcare crisis.\n\nStakeholders met on Tuesday for an emergency summit to come up with solutions and recommendations to address the issue.\n\nSurrey Brenda Locke says her city is growing quickly and has been for some time. She feels funding investments south of the Fraser used to be consistent but claims they money has dried up.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at where dollars are spent by the provincial and federal governments, it\u2019s north of the Fraser every single time. The growth in Metro Vancouver is here, south of the Fraser. It\u2019s where the projected growth is going to be, and we have been ignoring that for decades and we have now reached the tipping point,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen bed after bed after bed in hallways. Family members trying to keep the dignity of their loved one in a hallway setting. It\u2019s not OK.\u201d\n\nShe has met with Health Minister Adrian Dix to discuss the problem and has offered solutions, which she says include building a second tower at SMH but says nothing has changed.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, we\u2019re also talking about things like doctors. People don\u2019t have their own personal doctor. I don\u2019t have a GP,\u201d added Locke who goes on to say the provincial government doesn\u2019t understand the desperate need for access to healthcare. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand the need in the entire Fraser Health region and the size of it and the growth that\u2019s happening here.\u201d\n\nRoughly one million British Columbians don\u2019t currently have a family doctor, adding to the pressure on regional emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at SMH, and I\u2019ve done one of those real tours, not the one where you\u2019re cutting a ribbon and I\u2019ve seen bed after bed after bed in hallways. Family members trying to keep the dignity of their loved one in a hallway setting. It\u2019s not OK,\u201d Locke said.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nFormer Surrey mayor Dianne Watts says the healthcare crisis is not a new problem, and echoes Locke\u2019s comments that the region has been ignored.\n\nFunding investments dried up a long time ago, she says. \u201cWhen you look at the [number] of children that are being born here, the lack of women\u2019s services, the lack of maternity care south of the Fraser is really quite significant.\u201d\n\nShe thinks SMH should be a designated trauma hospital, like RCH.\n\n\u201cThe system is broken, and the system needs to be fixed and you can only do that when you have the frontline healthcare professionals\u2026 to come to the table and really look at the solutions. We have to realize hallway medicine is just not adequate,\u201d said Watts.\n\nWhere is the province?\n\nOpposition politicians are among those wondering where the health minister is.\n\n\u201cI am stunned by the lack of leadership by the minister. I am stunned by the lack of acknowledgment of the depth of the crisis that our communities are facing and it\u2019s time for results,\u201d said BC United Surrey South MLA Elenore Sturko. \u201cThe lack of leadership from [Dix] is, frankly, disturbing. This minister is failing in his duties and a change needs to happen asap.\u201d\n\nNot 1 Surrey NDP MLA has shown up to the Surrey Health Summit. At a time when our healthcare is in absolute crisis the BC NDP are MIA. #Surrey #bcpoli \u2014 Trevor Halford (@TrevHal) May 30, 2023\n\nBC United MLA for Surrey-White Rock Trevor Halford wants Dix to take accountability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perplexing that we still have a minister in charge when we see doctor after doctor speaking publicly. We got a minister who continues to put his head in the sand and pretend that everything\u2019s OK here. Clearly, we\u2019re at a crisis level at multiple hospitals. Everything is not OK. Patients are suffering and, in some cases, losing their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth MLAs say the majority of people coming forward to their respective offices are recounting horror stories of what they\u2019re facing when trying to get care.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s the fact they can\u2019t get their family doctor or whether the fact is now they\u2019re thinking twice in terms of whether or not they take their loved ones to a hospital in Surrey or Langley because of what they\u2019ve seen, and they\u2019re scared of the care they may get,\u201d said Halford.\n\n\u201cClearly, we\u2019re at a crisis level at multiple hospitals. Everything is not OK. Patients are suffering and, in some cases, losing their lives.\u201d\n\nThere was an emergency summit held in Surrey on Tuesday for stakeholders from various backgrounds, including medicine, to come up with recommendations to address the healthcare crisis. Halford says not one member of the BC NDP was in attendance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an absolute failure in leadership at the provincial level, whether it be Premier [David] Eby, Minister Dix and now this is a community that\u2019s starting to take that mantel and take that leadership and actually get the people who need to be in the room to find the solutions and try and get this crisis to a much better place than it is today,\u201d said Halford.\n\nIf you have an experience with the healthcare system you want to share, please reach out to reporters Mike Lloyd and Sonia Aslam."
