        "title": "Crypto Twitter Week in Review - Blockworks",
        "content": "With Elon Musk\u2019s new \u201cFor You\u201d feature and a seemingly never-ending parade of spam accounts, parsing through Twitter to find the best content feels like a full-time job.\n\nLucky for you, we\u2019ve curated the best of Crypto Twitter from last week, so you can stay up to date on the latest in memes, alpha and market sentiment.\n\nThe tweet that got everyone talking about Coinbase\u2019s NFT marketplace:\n\nArtist Jessica Yatrofsky broke the news to her followers that her planned February drop on Coinbase\u2019s NFT marketplace had been canceled. The tweet, in conjunction with Coinbase\u2019s recent layoffs, sparked speculation in the creator and crypto communities that the exchange may be shuttering its marketplace.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nHonorable mention to Coinbase\u2019s response, also, of course, posted on Twitter:\n\nCoinbase\u2019s official NFT account responded on Twitter and confirmed that upcoming creator drops had been paused. The exchange cited a need to focus on other \u201ctools and features\u201d creators want and denied claims that its marketplace would be shutting down.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nOrdinals receive mixed reaction:\n\nA major narrative of the week was Bitcoin NFTs. Ordinals, the controversial new genre of NFT which recently debuted on the Bitcoin blockchain, are, in theory, supposed to create a \u201chigher standard\u201d for digital artifacts. Crypto Twitter, to no one\u2019s surprise, had strong feelings.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBitcoiners prove that DOOM can, in fact, run on anything:\n\nSomeone uploaded a cloned version of the 30-year-old video game classic DOOM to the Bitcoin blockchain as an inscription on Ordinals. It yet again proves that coders can play the game on virtually anything (in the past, successful versions of DOOM have run on ATMs and calculators), to the delight of many crypto Twitter and Reddit circles.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBlockworks\u2019 David Canellis debunks Ripple rumors:\n\nAs the industry gears up for a resolution to Ripple\u2019s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC, many reports have focused on Ripple Labs\u2019 direct XRP sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. But Blockworks compiled the full six-year history of Ripple Labs\u2019 quarterly markets reports, stretching back to the inaugural edition in the fourth quarter of 2016, and it turns out Ripple\u2019s direct XRP sales only tell one part of the story.\n\nRead More: Ripple Bought $8.4B XRP Since SEC Lawsuit \u2018To Support Healthy Markets\u2019\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nA guide to options trading in DeFi:\n\nTwitter user @DefiIgnas is out to help traders get the 411 on option protocols, which they say are \u201cprimed for explosive growth.\u201d Catch up on the retail alpha in this thread.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.\n\nThe Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. Subscribe to daily Solana news from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nCraig Wright, the purported creator of Bitcoin, and David \u201cJoelKatz\u201d Schwartz, the CTO of Ripple, engaged in a furious altercation on Twitter. Wright\u2019s tweet claiming XRP to be a fraud set off the argument.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nOn the other hand, David Schwartz responded to the ridiculous assertion in his usual snarky manner. Craig Wright said in a post on Twitter that if someone ever mentions the CTO of Ripple, they should refer to him by his real name, which is \u201cconman Davie.\u201d He called Schwartz the Madoff of shitcoins.\n\n\u201cDave is a conman. XRP is a complete scam,\u201d says Wright confidently. Schwartz replied, \u201cIt\u2019s funny how you feel the need to attack me when, and only when, you are being criticized for your own indefensible actions.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Craig Wright may sue Bitcoin developers in court to force them to hand up cryptocurrency and change the code. Wright has filed a lawsuit against 15 developers in an effort to recover 111,000 bitcoins with a value of $2.5 billion.\n\nWright apparently lost the keys to his cryptocurrency wallets many years ago after becoming the victim of a cyberattack. Even though this lawsuit was first rejected last year, the U.K. Court of Appeal declared today that developers might have responsibilities to blockchain owners.\n\nIf Wright is successful in his lawsuit, the software developers might be compelled to produce new software that will assist Tulip Trading in recouping the entire amount of money it owes.\n\nAs for XRP, the token now has a value of $0.42 and is representing an on-chain signal that is mostly neutral. Getting back to it, this is not the first time Schwartz and Wright publicly argued about XRP. Wright has made it a habit to aggressively criticize XRP, the products created from it, and its creators. And Schwartz always claps back at him."

        "content": "If you have been monitoring recent crypto trading charts, you must be aware of the newfound rally in major cryptocurrencies since the start of 2023. The truth of the matter is that the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ripple are going northward and are gaining more traction among existing and new traders, businesses, and investors. Moreover, Big Eyes Coin has also joined the party by raising more than $21 million by Stage 10 of its presales. However, the presale phase is about to reach its end and if you are yet to pounce on the opportunity to grab a staggering 200% bonus, it is time to act.\n\nAlthough many cryptocurrencies offer similar services, some have stood out in a positive light. Each of these Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple has a special something that makes it unique and popular among other cryptocurrencies.\n\n1. They are Decentralized\n\nBig Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple Coin are not controlled by any central authority or government because they are decentralized. It adds an extra layer of security and protects their privacy, which allows users to trust their transactions. Decentralized networks don\u2019t have a central point of control, thereby mitigating the risk of a single point of failure.\n\nMoreover, hackers find it hard to breach into decentralized networks because they would need to attack many nodes in the network. These networks are more resistant to intervention from government entities or financial regulators.\n\n2. They Offer Security\n\nThe use of cutting-edge cryptography makes Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple Coin safe and secure options for their users. Security is an important factor when it comes to crypto trading. And the demand for secure and private financial transactions is always on the rise, which means this quality will take them to places in the times to come.\n\n3. They Deal with Liquidity Issues\n\nBitcoin and Ripple are widely traded, thereby making it easier to buy, sell and transfer them. Big Eyes Coin also comes with an innate ability to better deal with liquidity issues, which means it will soon join the ranks of the top cryptocurrencies for its innovation. All these three cryptocurrencies can easily be sold, bought, and transferred.\n\n4. Can\u2019t Ignore Immutability Factor\n\nIt\u2019s important to check out the immutability factor of these three cryptocurrencies. Transactions on their blockchain networks are permanent and unalterable, creating trust and transparency in the system. This is a significant advantage over traditional financial systems, where transactions can be altered or reversed.\n\n5. They Offer the Potential for High Returns\n\nWhether it is Big Eyes Coin, Ripple, or Bitcoin, the potential for price appreciation is on the higher side. It has been the case with both Bitcoin and Ripple in the past and the same is expected from the cat-themed meme coin Big Eyes Coin. With more people entering the crypto world, the chances for potentially high returns are unmatched.\n\nDon\u2019t Let the Opportunity Go Begging!\n\nThe opportunity is knocking on your door to enter the world of cryptocurrencies and make it big right away. Yes, you read it right! Big Eyes Coin, as part of its promotional campaigns, is offering a phenomenal 200% bonus. However, time is running out fast and if you want to get your hands on this incredible offer, you must act now. Use the promotional code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 today and give your crypto career the headstart it needs.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nThere are around 1,200 cryptocurrencies now and choosing the right one is nothing like a walk in the park. However, we have highlighted the above-mentioned factors that can help you in making the right decision.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is the most popular of the lot, Big Eyes Coin and other such cryptocurrencies are making their way into contention for leading the show in the years to come. Some of the other significant cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Litecoin, Namecoin, Syscoin, Dogecoin, and so on.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple are all excellent investment opportunities for those looking to enter the cryptocurrency market with a bang.\n\nFind Out More About Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nDisclaimer: Nairametrics is not affiliated with any cryptocurrency company.
