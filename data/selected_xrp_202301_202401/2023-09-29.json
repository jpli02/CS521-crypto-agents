        "title": "Bruce Museum / Eskew+Dumez+Ripple - ArchDaily",
        "content": "+ 20\n\nMore Specs\n\nLess Specs\n\nText description provided by the architects. The Bruce Museum is a regional cultural institution located in Greenwich, Connecticut with a multi-disciplinary collection and exhibition program bringing together art, science, and natural history. In 2014, following a national design competition, the Bruce Museum embarked on a journey to revitalize its campus to carry the institution into the future. Following the competition, the design team led a rigorous initial programming study to dig deep into the needs of the museum and support its ability to serve as a community resource.\n\nThe resulting project is a comprehensive renovation of the existing museum\u2019s 32,500-square-foot structure along with a 42,000-square-foot addition, providing permanent and changing gallery space, expanded collection storage, and a new public entrance lobby and lecture hall for the museum. Comprising three floors, the expansion more than doubles the existing area of the facility and creates a welcoming visitor experience with clear circulation, generous galleries, and sufficient exhibition, storage, and archival spaces for the Museum\u2019s growing collection.\n\nThe new design addresses the problematic visitor wayfinding of the previous museum design. Before this expansion, the museum entry faced north towards noisy Interstate 95, located at the top of a hill and hidden from the view of visitors arriving at the site. The new design reorientates the entrance to face the adjoining Bruce Park, providing visitors with an immersive landscape experience before their entrance into the museum. Because the addition primarily stands apart from the existing house, the design team worked to develop a courtyard space between the two structures, one that serves to extend the park into the footprint of the museum to orient visitors as they move throughout the space.\n\nSince opening, the museum\u2019s new spaces have quickly become a catalyst for diverse forms of engagement. The double-height lobby, caf\u00e9, and gift shop seamlessly merge to create an open and free-flowing public space. The new lecture hall has become a hub for community programming, celebratory gatherings, and public lectures and receptions.\n\nNew changing and permanent galleries enable the museum to host new, ambitious exhibitions and provide opportunities for engagement and education. \u201cWe can host the community in a way we\u2019ve never been able to before,\u201d Bruce Museum Executive Director Robert Wolterstorff says. \u201cIn the past, we had no permanent collections galleries.\u201d By adding these spaces, the museum can showcase works that local collectors have generously donated, providing the impetus for other collectors to do the same.\n\nNatural daylighting was fundamental to the design concept. Openings in the fa\u00e7ade suffuse the interior spaces with light, gradually receding in intensity as one moves into the collection galleries. Drawing inspiration from the unique geology of its site and surrounding region, the design team developed a delicately striated fa\u00e7ade of cast stone and glass inspired by stone quarries found along the Connecticut coast. This exterior, animated by the play of light across the fa\u00e7ade, dramatically changes appearance as the sun traverses the sky over the course of the day and time of year."

        "title": "A Ripple in the Pacific: From Saipan to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and back - U.S. Coast Guard",
        "content": "In the Pacific's azure expanse, four young men from Saipan are charting a unique course. Cadets Genzo Gonzales, Seiji Gonzales, Kyle San Nicolas, and Noah Mesa of the U.S. U.S. Coast Guard Academy are bridging their love for the sea and cultural roots to the prestige of one of America's most renowned maritime institutions. This summer, they journeyed back to their home waters, not as ordinary islanders but as burgeoning U.S. Coast Guard officers poised to reshape their maritime communities.\n\n\n\nCurrently hailing from the U.S. U.S. Coast Guard Academy, an institution with a venerable history of training the nation's future maritime leaders, these cadets embody the Academy's mission. Coming from an island culture that holds the ocean as a central figure, these young men have decided to harness their affinity for the sea and utilize it to protect their nation's waters.\n\n\n\n\"It's about diversification, representation,\" said Genzo Gonzales. \"Having that representation in the U.S. Coast Guard allows us to grow stronger.\" This belief in the strength of diverse perspectives drives these cadets to bring their unique insights into the U.S. Coast Guard's operations.\n\n\n\nOn their recent visit to the active-duty stations and Fast Response Cutters in their home region, the cadets were excited to see the operations up close.\n\n\n\n\"The sense of community and learning on the USCGC Oliver Henry was invaluable,\" said Mesa, \"As a Pacific Islander, the opportunity to serve in the region I call home is an honor. It was eye-opening to witness how the U.S. Coast Guard operates in real-world scenarios right in my own backyard. From the crew to the operations, the experience has only deepened my commitment to serving in Guam, my top choice for a commission.\"\n\n\n\nThey saw it as an opportunity to bridge the gap between their theoretical knowledge and real-world application, to experience first-hand the tangible impact of the U.S. Coast Guard's work.\n\n\n\n\"Our involvement in the operations was enlightening,\" said Seiji Gonzales, who found great value in \"seeing the U.S. Coast Guard from a perspective that it's not the academy, it's hands-on.\" His sentiments were echoed by San Nicolas, who found the crew to be \"very welcoming\" and was grateful for the experience of shadowing the crew and \"seeing what the real U.S. Coast Guard is like.\" Mesa also offered, \"This human connection adds a layer of meaning to the missions, making them not just a duty, but a calling.\"\n\n\n\nHis insights reveal that the Coast Guard's strength lies in its high-level training and state-of-the-art equipment and its ability to connect deeply with the communities it serves.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, their time on the Fast Response Cutters helped them comprehend the extensive responsibilities held by the crew. Genzo Gonzales described his exhilaration at being part of a typhoon response team and flying with the HC-130 Hercules aircraft crews from Hawaii around their islands as part of the broader U.S. Coast Guard operations. \"It's really gaining an appreciation for all of the U.S. Coast Guard work from officers to enlisted as well,\" he noted.\n\n\n\nTheir participation in these operations reaffirmed their choice to pursue a career in the U.S. Coast Guard and deepened their understanding of the service's complex, multifaceted tasks. It also gave them an appreciation for their role in enhancing the U.S. Coast Guard's operations with their unique perspective as individuals hailing from the Pacific Islands.\n\n\n\n\"I get excited at the concept of traveling Oceania to islands I've only seen on classroom globes. Through the FRC, I wish to indulge in my cultural background as a Pacific Islander, \" said Mesa. \"I want to give back to the places I call home through the missions of the Coast Guard.\"\n\n\n\nAs the summer came to a close and the cadets prepared to return to the Academy, they reflected on the bond they shared with their ocean-centric culture, their duty to the nation, and their role as future U.S. Coast Guard officers.\n\n\n\n\"They are a testament to the fact that some of our most effective future leaders come from regions rich in maritime tradition,\" says Capt. Simmons, commander of U.S. Coast Guard Forces Micronesia/Sector Guam. \"I'm excited about what lies ahead for them and the U.S. Coast Guard.\" As the cadets journey forward, they carry with them the invaluable lessons learned in the waters of their homeland and a resolve to be worthy of the traditions of the United States Coast Guard.\n\n\n\n-USCG-"

        "title": "Ripple Says the Global Economy Needs a Global Payment Scheme - PYMNTS.com",
        "content": "Transforming the world takes time, even when innovations aim at just one part of it.\n\nThat, at least on the surface, appears to be the story with crypto and blockchain technology, which have together been honing their real-world utility within the traditional financial services and money-movement ecosystem for over a decade now.\n\nBut while the digital asset industry\u2019s enthusiasts may have underestimated just how much inertia there is in the political and economic systems of the world\u2019s major regions, that doesn\u2019t mean that the innovative technology hasn\u2019t been driving both change and real business value across the way that the world moves, manages and tokenizes value.\n\n\u201cBig banks and financial institutions are much more interested today than they certainly were five or six years ago, when we rolled out some products for the first time,\u201d Brooks Entwistle, Senior VP of Global Customer Success and Managing Director at enterprise crypto solutions company Ripple, told PYMNTS. \u201cYou certainly almost never saw the boardroom when you brought up the topic of blockchain and especially crypto in the early days.\u201d\n\nAt least part of the reason for the growing interest is because as the world becomes more and more digitized, the limiting fragmentation of a truly global economy without a truly global banking system increasingly starts to rear its head.\n\n\u201cThis core problem of how long it takes to move money across borders, whether that\u2019s a remittance situation where someone\u2019s trying to get money from a Saudi Arabian oil field back to their family in South Asia or in the Philippines, or small and medium enterprise businesses who are doing payroll or paying suppliers \u2013 you\u2019re being charged serious rates to move money across borders, and you also have an inability to track those payments and know they\u2019ve arrived with certainty,\u201d Entwistle explained.\n\nSolving Long-Standing Inefficiencies\n\nAs long as people and businesses are being charged fees of 6-7% to send money to various countries, there exists an attractive opportunity to bring that cost down while providing a better user experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been building businesses in Asia now for 30 years. That problem is still here and is still a big one,\u201d Entwistle said.\n\nAnd the problem is only growing as companies around the world continue to expand globally, but find themselves increasingly running up against the legacy limitations of cross-border payment channels.\n\n\u201cAs these businesses grow, it comes with the need to really move value faster, and in more places \u2026 the ability to use a digital asset as the bridge currency in this transaction between sender and receiver brings the whole kind of dream to fruition, because you are able to have a sender that can lock in an FX (foreign exchange) rate and have that settlement go across the blockchain to a receiver on the other end, and have an instantaneous conversion of local currency paid out to that local partner where the end recipient is waiting,\u201d Entwistle explained.\n\nIn contrast to traditional methods that involve correspondent banks, one-way messaging and disproportionately high fees, blockchain-based cross-border payment solutions are faster, more transparent and more cost-effective.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, so much of this is about capital being locked up in pre-funded accounts; in working capital stuck in multiple countries; in accounts on the other side of a trade in some minimal amount. The ability to move value around quickly \u2014 as opposed to locking it all in one place \u2014 frees up not just capital, but the energy and opportunity for growth in these businesses,\u201d Entwistle said.\n\nTaming the Regulatory Elephant in the Room\n\nStill, despite the technology being available and mature, what\u2019s crucial for broader adoption of blockchain-based money movement vehicles and commonplace crypto liquidity bridges is solving for a global patchwork of non-interoperable regulations policing the industry.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do this unless we go into new markets and new countries and have a dialogue with the regulator first and explain to them what we can bring to this market, what we can bring to their business community, what we can bring to their end consumers and therefore citizens,\u201d Entwistle said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have that, things get stuck in a way that ultimately just constraints growth.\u201d\n\nIn an era where secure financial transactions are paramount, the importance of having the right individuals on a payment network cannot be overstated. Trust is the foundation that helps reduce risks and ensures the smooth functioning of the financial ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI came out of another network business \u2014 the ride-hailing business \u2014 and you\u2019re only as strong in a network situation as the weakest point in that network. If something goes wrong or a bad actor gets on that, it\u2019s a big problem for everyone involved. So, at Ripple, we take the onboarding process extremely seriously. It\u2019s a lengthy process. And what it enables us to do is to have this 70-country network, which you can\u2019t build overnight,\u201d Entwistle explained.\n\nAs for what the Ripple senior leader sees in the future?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of movement that trading companies do across borders, with payments needed at many stops along the way. We think that is a real opportunity, but there are two other areas where Ripple sees real opportunity in and where we\u2019re building businesses around: central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization,\u201d Entwistle said. \u201cThey\u2019re both exciting spaces where the real-world benefits of blockchain and digital assets can find a home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think about some of the opportunities in the equity markets and fixed-income markets around the world to tokenize financial assets and corporate bonds, the settlement of which is extremely onerous and takes forever, it is extremely exciting.\u201d."

Now Milwaukee has added one of the league\u2019s most cold-blooded scorers and clutch performers.\n\nMilwaukee should be the favorites in the East, assuming good fortune with health. But what do we make of the rest of the likely top teams?\n\nSpeaking of\u2026\n\nStargazing\n\nWhich big name could be on the move next?\n\nWhenever we\u2019ve spent months wondering where a star will be traded and that player finally gets dealt, we immediately look for the next name who might want to be on the move. Are we going to fall into that same trap at The Bounce?\n\nAbsolutely. Let\u2019s kick around some names:\n\nJoel Embiid: A lot of people are wondering about him after the team failed with Ben Simmons and then James Harden. Maybe Embiid will end up being a Sixer for life, but eventually, stars get frustrated with never progressing. There\u2019s a lot of pressure on Nick Nurse and Daryl Morey to figure this out.\n\nA lot of people are wondering about him after the team failed with Ben Simmons and then James Harden.

Giannis Antetokounmpo: This is just other teams hoping this Lillard thing doesn\u2019t work. They\u2019ll hold on to his summer comments as a beyond optimistic \u201cmaybe.\u201d\n\nThis is just other teams hoping this Lillard thing doesn\u2019t work.

We also know how Harden feels about Morey. Harden is still a high impact player who wants out.\n\nWe know he wants to go to the Clippers. We know Morey isn\u2019t interested in that.

Trae Young: This was more of an early summer musing with a lot of confusion regarding the Hawks organization. I doubt they have to seriously worry about this for another couple years, if ever. But teams will be on the lookout for signs of discontent.\n\nThis was more of an early summer musing with a lot of confusion regarding the Hawks organization.

Pascal Siakam: Plenty of trade rumors already for him this summer, but a lack of commitment from Siakam following hypothetical trades tanked a lot of those ideas.\n\nPlenty of trade rumors already for him this summer, but a lack of commitment from Siakam following hypothetical trades tanked a lot of those ideas. Zach LaVine: The Bulls would probably love to get out from under this money. Not sure there is a deal that truly works for both sides if his health is in question.\n\nThe Bulls would probably love to get out from under this money.

Karl-Anthony Towns: Assuming health, the Wolves will get a true idea of whether their two big men work in a world in which you want an open floor for Anthony Edwards.\n\nAssuming health, the Wolves will get a true idea of whether their two big men work in a world in which you want an open floor for Anthony Edwards. Zion Williamson: Who the hell knows at this point? We just want to see him on the court.\n\nPortland Reacts!\n\nOn-the-ground reporting (sort of)\n\nI\u2019ve been in Oregon following my trip to Japan and decided to spend a couple of days in Portland for some relaxation.\n\nI wasn\u2019t there more than 45 minutes before Shams\u2019 tweets started blowing up my phone. I facepalmed at my own brash confidence that I wouldn\u2019t need to do any work, fired up Slack and figured out how to get those trades grades done.\n\nI stood on the sidewalk in front of a vintage clothing store called The Recycled Plant, staring at a 1992 Barcelona Olympics Clyde Drexler jersey, forming my thoughts and getting my fingers firing on my phone screen.\n\nAfter that, I grabbed an impromptu haircut. Here are some real-time Blazers fans reactions from the walk there and the cut itself:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a state of shock, bro. We traded Dame. It actually happened.\u201d \u2014 man with hands on his head walking into the barber.\n\n\u201cIs Deandre Ayton even good?\u201d \u2014 man to his friend on the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat can we get for Jrue? It won\u2019t mess up us getting a top pick, will it?\u201d \u2014 another guy getting his haircut.\n\n\u201cThis clears the way for Scoot to get Rookie of the Year.\u201d \u2014 man walking his dog as they popped into the barber to say hi to friends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad Pat Riley didn\u2019t get his way.\u201d \u2014 guy outside a coffee shop.\n\n\u201cF\u2014!\u201d \u2014 guy on the street looking at his phone. I\u2019m just assuming the expletive was about Dame.\n\nAbove all, this Kevin James meme finding its way into the news made my day more than anything.\n\nYou were saying? pic.twitter.com/NeYFTkFmZM \u2014 The Pettiest Laker Fan \ud83e\udd2b (@ThePettiestLA) September 27, 2023\n\nBounce Passes\n\nTom Haberstroh says the NBA All-Star draft predicted this Dame-Giannis pairing.\n\nWe\u2019re really doing this again. All eyes on Ben Simmons in Brooklyn this coming season.\n\nThe Warriors are trying to bring a WNBA team to the Bay Area.\n\nThe Wizards believe they\u2019re leveling up with their new plan for the roster.\n\nIf you can, please support our friend and colleague Tas Melas and his family by donating, sharing or just keeping them in your thoughts and prayers.\n\nHitting Pause\n\nDue to the Lillard trade news, we\u2019re going to hold the Friday movie review of \u201cSunset Park\u201d for another day. In the meantime, enjoy this highly disturbing basketball scene from Halle Berry\u2019s \u201cCatwoman.\u201d\n\n(Top photo of Damian Lillard: Soobum Im / USA Today)"
