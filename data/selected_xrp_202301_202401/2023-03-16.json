Advani said the company has seen the biggest growth during the two years it has been involved in the legal battle with the SEC.\n\nIn December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging the US$1.38 billion sale of XRP, the crypto token that powers Ripple\u2019s payment and remittance network, constituted an illegal offering of unregistered securities.\n\nBrooks Entwistle, Ripple\u2019s managing director for the Asia Pacific, Middle East and North Africa, said at the same conference that the future of the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. itself will be influenced greatly by the ruling in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit.\n\nAdvani said in an interview with Forkast in January he expects the judge to make a ruling in the case in the first half of this year.\n\nSee related article: MoneyGram seeks to seal parts of its filings in the XRP lawsuit between Ripple, SEC"

That will have a mix of two, three and four-bedroom apartments across 10 levels.\n\n\n\nA render of Kloud. Image supplied\n\nThey're just waiting for development approval for Kloud before launching later this year.\n\nThere's already been significant interest in the two projects before they've launched, the majority from Brisbane and locals. There's been a number of buyers enquire who have purchased in some of Graya's previous projects in Brisbane.\n\nKloud and Ripple are set to join the luxury ranks alongside STEER's Cote Palm Beach project, which will have 17 half-floor apartments, each with three-bedrooms, three-bathrooms, and two parking spaces.\n\nDKO studio director Kai Chua says the design of each apartment, balances the need for shelter and privacy whilst opening to the ocean and magnificent views.

        "title": "Researcher aims to assess ripple effects of rodent disease - University of Alberta",
        "content": "Mice, voles and other rodents are small, but as carriers of disease, they can pack a mighty punch.\n\nThe chronic infections they carry may not only threaten their existence as a food source for larger wildlife, but also pose a health risk to humans.\n\nIt\u2019s a pressing issue that Ivana Schoepf, a new assistant professor at the University of Alberta\u2019s Augustana Campus, plans to address as she launches research into how small mammals cope with the stress of disease, particularly when they are also facing extra strain from changes in their habitats.\n\nThe double challenge can weaken the animals\u2019 resistance even further, \u201cwhich could lead to diseases spreading faster,\u201d she says.\n\nAppointed to Augustana\u2019s Department of Science this past summer, Schoepf is studying voles and mice through the Augustana Miquelon Lake Research Station.\n\nThe conservation scientist hopes to help reduce disease risk to forest dwellers like hunters, trappers, hikers and tourists, and protect vulnerable wildlife populations.\n\nBoth types of rodents are common carriers of serious conditions that can be transmitted to humans, such as hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus and giardiasis, a diarrheal disease.\n\nKnowing more about the toll the disease takes is important to ultimately finding solutions, says Schoepf.\n\n\u201cAs COVID has shown us, human health can be greatly affected by the spread of zoonotic diseases. Only when we\u2019ve gained enough fundamental knowledge about how disease affects individuals and populations can we find ways to tackle its spread.\u201d\n\n\u201cCascading effects\u201d of disease\n\nSchoepf will also investigate how the chronic infections mice and voles harbour could be affecting their ability to reproduce, grow and survive.\n\nThe tiny creatures are vital to the survival of other animals, Schoepf notes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to know more about these rodents; they are at the base of the food pyramid for many carnivores in Alberta, like coyotes and lynx. If these diseases result in fitness costs to rodents, then we might see cascading effects impacting their predators too.\u201d\n\nStudy findings from Schoepf\u2019s postdoctoral work already indicate that chronic infection does indeed take a toll in at least one species.\n\nThe research showed that when a chronic parasitic infection in female red-winged blackbirds was reduced medically, they laid heavier eggs, incubated them longer and fed the chicks more often.\n\nIn addition, the chicks from medicated mothers were in better condition and had higher survival rates than fledglings from unmedicated females. And male blackbirds territorially responsible for unmedicated mothers had to work harder, feeding those chicks at a higher rate than male counterparts who were helping medicated females.\n\n\u201cIt tells us that chronic infection is definitely costly, and these costs affect the entire population, through all stages of the life cycle,\u201d Schoepf says.\n\nThat effect may, in turn, further jeopardize wildlife already on the brink of extinction, she says.\n\n\u201cIt could lead to populations crashing.\u201d\n\nHer research at the U of A will continue to expand on those findings, by focusing next on red-winged blackbird chicks at Miquelon Lake, measuring how infection affects their physiology and behaviour.\n\nBecause acute infections typically result in high virulence and mortality in wildlife populations, the animals are seldom available to study, Schoepf notes.\n\n\u201cAs a result, our knowledge remains limited, so the hope is that we can build more insight into the costs of infections.\u201d\n\nFertile ground for research\n\nWith its distinct seasons and mix of both developed and agricultural land, Alberta \u2014 and the Miquelon Lake area in particular \u2014 offer a prime environment for studying how wildlife copes with change, she adds.\n\n\u201cAs a small provincial park surrounded by agricultural land, it's a pretty ideal place to study the questions I have.\u201d\n\nDrawn to the U of A by its standing as one of the largest universities in Canada and its wide array of researchers, Schoepf is aiming to expand her work through collaboration with other researchers at the university, particularly in population genetics. She hopes to discover more about gene flow, the transfer of genetic material between different animal populations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a field that can potentially give great insights into how certain diseases persist in some populations more than others.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Schoepf is hopeful her future research could help inform conservation of wild animal populations, including those at risk of extinction, she adds.\n\n\u201cBy understanding how disease affects wildlife, we can design more robust management plans for the conservation of vulnerable species.\u201d"
