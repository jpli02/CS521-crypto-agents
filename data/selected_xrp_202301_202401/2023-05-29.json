        "content": "Some restaurants in Boulder City's Historic Downtown noticed a boost in business over Memorial Day weekend.\n\n\"It's great,\" Cindy Ford, the owner, said. \"We've been really, really busy. Three-day weekends are always really busy.\"\n\nShe said business is up about 10% this weekend compared to the same time last year.\n\nUp the street is the Coffee Cup Caf\u00e9 owned by Terry Stevens. He also noticed more people around town over the holiday weekend.\n\n\n\nSome new foot traffic is attributed to the Best Dam BBQ event, but Stevens suspects Lake Mead's water levels recently rising helps bring more people to town.\n\n\"We're really happy that we got some inflow of water,\" Stevens said. \"It's a community based on the lake. I think that's something that I think we all realized, how that can affect us when the lake levels go down. It has an impact.\"\n\nData show Lake Mead reaching 1,054 feet above sea level on Memorial Day. That's more than 5 feet above the recorded lake levels at this time in 2022. However, it's far from back to normal. Lake levels were recorded at 1,091 feet above sea level in 2020.\n\nSome visitors said water levels don't influence their decision to visit the town.\n\n\"One has nothing to do with the other. It's just a great little city,\" Nancy Williford said. \"There's little shops, and it's just a darling place.\""

        "content": "Renowned legal expert Jeremy Hogan discussed secondary market sales of XRP in Ripple's battle with the SEC on Twitter. Hogan believes that resolving this issue is crucial for XRP's relisting on exchanges and determining its security classification.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the language used by the SEC in its lawsuit implies that XRP itself is a security akin to a share of stock, the court documents do not explicitly request this classification for the asset, leading the attorney to dismiss such a notion as absurd.\n\nThe challenge lies in the fact that the presiding judge may not address the issue, as it has not been explicitly raised by the plaintiff. While one could argue that the omission indirectly addresses it, the impact on exchanges remains uncertain. However, Hogan believes there is reason for hope.\n\nWhat are the options?\n\nOne potential solution is for Ripple to secure an agreement with the SEC to exclude the issue from the final judgment, or the judge could approve language proposed by Ripple to that effect, similar to what was allowed in the KIK Interactive case.\n\nAlternatively, the judge might consider concerns raised by various parties, including XRP holders represented by attorney Deaton, regarding secondary sales. The LBRY case provides some precedent for addressing this issue.\n\nIf Ripple loses the case, the judge might address secondary sales during the \"penalties\" stage, when drafting a disgorgement order. Ripple could argue that only direct purchasers should receive their investment back, citing the SEC v. Wang case.\n\nHogan believes the court would likely agree, as failing to do so would result in minimal compensation for individual purchasers, effectively settling the matter of secondary sales."

        "content": "Bitcoin price shows a classic Power of Three (PO3) setup in play, forecasting a potential decline to $25,296.\n\nEthereum price could attempt a rally to $2,028 if the bullish outlook persists.\n\nRipple price has set up an inverse head-and-shoulders setup, forecasting a 10.76% increase to $0.515.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has surprised investors with a quick uptick over the weekend, but it is unclear if this is a spurt in buying pressure or a reentry of sidelined buyers. Judging by the price action, the cause of the uptick is unclear and the bearish outlook explained in previous articles is still valid.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC set to punish greedy bulls\n\nBitcoin price ready to collapse\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price breached its two-week consolidation on May 28 and collected the buy-stop liquidity resting above May 10 swing high at $28,293. This liquidity run was soon followed by a retracement, which is underway and signals a Power of Three (PO3) setup in play.\n\nThis technical formation has three phases \u2013 accumulation, manipulation and distribution. As the name indicates, the asset usually moves sideways in the first phase and is often followed by a sweep of a critical level, which is termed manipulation.\n\nThe third or the last phase is distribution, which leads to volatile rallies in the opposite direction of manipulation. In Bitcoin\u2019s case, BTC swept a local top at $28,293 and is trading at $27,879, signaling the next move should favor bears.\n\nIf this setup plays out, Bitcoin price could reach the $25,764 support level to collect the sell-stop liquidity. Should the selling pressure persist even after this 7.6% decline, BTC price could hit the next critical support level at $25,296.\n\nThese levels are key accumulation levels, as seen in previous articles.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC delays inevitable crash to $25,000\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin price continues to tread above the $28,051 level, it could attempt an extension of this weekend's rally. If the move leads to a flip of the $30,000 psychological level, it would invalidate the bearish thesis.\n\nIn such a case, BTC could attempt a retest of the $32,450 hurdle.\n\nEthereum price needs to stay above this level\n\nEthereum price has overcome the $1,817 hurdle and shot up 7% over the weekend. ETH trades at $1,898 at the time of writing but it needs to hold above the $1,853 support level to resume its uptrend.\n\nIf successful, ETH could eye a retest of the $2,028 hurdle followed by a sweep of the April 16 high at $2,147.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nOn the contrary, if Ethereum price breaches the $1,853 support level, investors should pay attention to $1,817. If this level fails to hold, ETH will invalidate the bullish thesis and could trigger a correction to $1,703.\n\nRipple price flips bullish amid confusing times\n\nRipple price has set up an inverse head-and-shoulders set up on the four-hour chart. This technical formation contains three swing lows, with the central one lower than the other two. The ones on each side are defined as the shoulders, while the central one is the head. Connecting the peaks using a trend line reveals a declining resistance level known as the neckline.\n\nThis setup forecasts a 10.76% upswing to $0.515, determined by measuring the distance between the right shoulder\u2019s peak and the head\u2019s lowest point, adding it to the breakout point at $0.465 (see chart below).\n\nSo far, Ripple price has not only breached the neckline but has also rallied nearly 4%, currently trading at $0.481. If the bullish trend continues, XRP price could rally another 7.30% before it hits the theoretical target.\n\nXRP/USD 4-hour chart\n\nInvalidation of the inverse head-and-shoulders setup will occur if Ripple price slices the neckline at $0.465. If this bearish outlook continues, XRP price could slide towards the May 24 low at $0.442."

        "content": "Sandra Thompson, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates the Home Loan banks. Al Drago/Bloomberg\n\nNot all of the Federal Home Loan Banks will survive\n\nAs the banking industry consolidates further due to fallout from the liquidity crisis, some experts suggest that the 11 regional Federal Home Loan banks should be downsized as well.\n\n\n\nIn March and early April, the Home Loan Bank System issued roughly $430 billion in debt to support its members' demands for cash advances. The liquidity backstop could be the undoing of many other banks that may be technically insolvent due to underwater securities portfolios or have other underlying problems.\n\n\n\nThe two banks that failed in March \u2014 Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank \u2014 and Silvergate Bank, which voluntarily closed, each tapped the Home Loan Bank System for billions of dollars.\n\n\n\nBecause each regional Home Loan bank operates independently, some critics suggest the banks may not be collectively identifying problems among their members and hewing to safety and soundness concerns. Critics argue that the system has become unwieldy.\n\n\n\nRyan Donovan, president and CEO of the Council of Home Loan Banks, a trade group that represents the system, said it was \"premature to speculate on what the FHFA might do.\"\n\n\n\n\"The regional nature of the FHLBanks was shown to be highly effective both in the most recent market disruptions as well as in meeting member needs throughout the history of the system,\" Donovan said.\n\n\n\nThe Home Loan Bank System, created by Congress during the Depression to provide funding to savings and loans, was modeled on the Federal Reserve banks. The 11 regional banks lend money to their roughly 6,500 members in the form of secured loans, known as advances.\n\n\n\nThe system's Office of Finance issues bonds that carry an implied government guarantee but critics argue that taxpayers are not getting as good of a return on their investment compared with the banks' members. The system is \"very much a creature of the politics and geography of 1932,\" said Edward Golding, executive director of the MIT Golub Center for Finance and Policy, senior lecturer, and former member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, a predecessor to the current system.\n\n\n\nSandra Thompson, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates the Home Loan banks, has authority under the Bank Act to merge or consolidate the Home Loan banks. Given the attention the Home Loan Bank system has recently garnered, it may be hard for Thompson to resist the urge to restructure the government-sponsored enterprise. Last year Thompson launched the first major review of the system in 90 years. Consolidation would be a major step toward far-reaching reforms.\n\n\n\n\"There needs to be consolidation,\" said Stephen Cross, an advisor at Alvarez & Marsal and former deputy FHFA director, during a panel in March.\n\n\n\nGolding, who also spoke on the panel, said, \"If you were to start with a blank sheet of paper you probably would not have 12 or 11 banks.\" The FHFA is expected to take a more active role in providing both market and mission discipline by focusing on the banks' boards. These boards are stacked with directors who are both shareholders and customers of each bank. Some experts think at least half of each board should be independent.\n\n\n\n\"Institutionally, all of these types of quasi-public institutions do better with more voices in control,\" said Michael Hanson, CEO of Massachusetts Credit Union Share Insurance Corp. Hanson said he thinks 60% of each banks' board should be independent as a \"counterweight\" to the banks' members.\n\n\n\nThe banks have said they are open to the FHFA's review but are lobbying heavily for no changes to their business model of providing liquidity to members. Others see the system differently.\n\n\n\n\"The purpose of facilitating a robust housing market is the primary purpose of the FHLB system,\" Hanson said.\n\n\n\nTo that end, the FHFA is expected to issue a report soon with suggestions for both regulatory and legislative changes. \u2014 Kate Berry"
