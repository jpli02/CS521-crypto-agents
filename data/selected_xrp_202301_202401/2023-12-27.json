        "content": "George Osodi/Bloomberg\n\nNigeria lets banks open accounts for crypto firms\n\nNigeria, the nation with the highest rate of cryptocurrency adoption after India, allowed lenders to deal with companies providing digital tokens, reversing a ban the central bank introduced in 2021, the BusinessDay reported.\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria asked lenders to open accounts for crypto firms, according to the report, which cited a circular dated Friday. In February 2021, the central bank had ordered deposit-taking financial institutions to immediately close accounts transacting in or operating cryptocurrency exchanges, saying such deals are \"prohibited.\"\n\n\n\nThe easing of rules will be a boost for crypto exchanges, which have been seeking to expand in the nation that ranks second in blockchain data company Chainalysis Inc.'s adoption index.\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency transactions in Africa's most-populated nation grew 9%, Chainalysis said in September, even as prices of virtual assets such as bitcoin plunged. Nigeria's currency has weakened almost 49% this year after President Bola Tinubu eased rules in a bid to remove the spread between the official and unauthorized street rates. A depreciating currency spurred residents to seek crypto assets. \u2014Arijit Ghosh, Bloomberg News\n\n"

        "content": "American blockchain payments firm Ripple Labs Inc. has completed the internal transfer of 70,000,000 XRP.\n\nAccording to data insights from Whale Alert, the 70 million XRP originated from an address controlled by Ripple. At the time Ripple initiated the transaction, it was valued at $43,171,395, implying that each XRP token moved was priced at $0.6167.\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP price has jumped to $0.6241, up by 0.83% in the past 24 hours. The coin\u2019s market capitalization has also soared by an equal rate to $33,770,969,356, marking a major deviation from the bearish path set by the trading volume which is down 13.85% to $1,505,001,631.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP Movement: a Predominant Trend\n\nWhile it was visible that the funds originated from a Ripple account, the fear of selloff is allayed as the assets were moved to another wallet the company activated on October 2.\n\nThe wallet the funds originated from has been active since August 11, 2015, and the last 5 transactions this month featured a credit of 200,000,000 XRP on December 1.\n\nThe remaining transactions were debit, including two outflows of 60,000,000 XRP, one involving 120,000,000 XRP, and the most recent 70,000,000 XRP. After the latest transfer, the Ripple-owned wallet boasts a balance of 26.340 million XRP.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe receiving wallet on the other hand is a relatively new one with a balance of 165.806 million XRP at the time of writing. Prior to this deposit of 70,000,000 XRP, the address recorded a series of outflows of 500,000 XRP, 400,000 XRP, and 10.575 million respectively.\n\nThe internal transfers of XRP now form a key trend that is possibly defining the firm\u2019s operational activity.\n\nXRP Whale Transfer Watch\n\nXRP whale transfers are a key defining factor in the coin\u2019s current momentum. While Ripple remains a top whale shaping XRP\u2019s liquidity, there are also unknown whales whose transfer activity equally shapes the outlook of the coin."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nBinance has announced the addition of new trading pairs, including SOL/USDC, XRP/USDC, ADA/USDC, and MATIC/USDC.\n\nThe listing of these tokens on Binance might contribute to their perceived credibility and legitimacy, potentially increasing investor confidence.\n\nThe article contrasts this with the potential negative impacts of delisting assets from major exchanges, as seen with the recent removal of several trading pairs from Binance, which adversely affected their prices.\n\nBinance Adds More Trading Pairs\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume \u2013 Binance \u2013 announced it will expand its services by adding SOL/USDC, XRP/USDC, ADA/USDC, MATIC/USDC, and six other trading pairs to its platform. The amendments are scheduled to come into force tomorrow (December 28).\n\nFurther support from a crypto behemoth like Binance might positively affect the prices of involved digital assets. It could increase liquidity and make the tokens more readily available for trading.\n\nSome of the tokens included in Binance\u2019s latest effort have indeed headed north shortly after the announcement. Ripple (XRP) has climbed by almost 2% in the past 24 hours, surpassing the $0.63 mark, whereas Cardano (ADA) has exceeded $0.60.\n\nThe uptrend with Polygon (MATIC) is the most evident, with the coin\u2019s valuation jumping by approximately 20% and exceeding $1.05 for the first time since April this year.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that while these are new listings, all the assets mentioned above were already available for trading on Binance in various trading pairs.\n\nWhat Could Happen When Binance Removes Assets?\n\nContrary to the benefits of listing on major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, the opposite effort could significantly impact the prices of the involved digital assets, typically in a negative way. Loss of credibility, decreased liquidity, and reputational damage are some of the potential setbacks that the included tokens might experience following the action.\n\nThe removal of several trading pairs, such as BTS/USDT, PERL/USDT, TORN/BUSD, WTC/BTC, and WTC/USDT, earlier this month from Binance\u2019s platform could serve as an example of the aforementioned thesis.\n\nDespite its recent surge, TORN\u2019s valuation is down over 50% since the disclosure, whereas PERL has collapsed by over 75%."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCryptocurrency wallet tracker Whale Alert, which reports the details of large transactions by whales and cryptocurrency exchanges, has reported that over the last 24 hours, it spotted a jaw-dropping amount of XRP moved by anonymous wallets and Ripple fintech decacorn.\n\nIn the meantime, the XRP community has been making wild guesses as to who could have made these massive XRP transactions and whether they may have any impact on the coin\u2019s price. The latter has shown a mild increase.\n\nBinance shovels 440 million XRP\n\nThe source above spread the word about four large transactions that moved astounding chunks of the Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency. The largest chunk contained 300,000,000 XRP evaluated at $185,083,895. The smaller one carried 139,374,499 XRP worth $86,206,784.\n\nThese were the two biggest transfers here. The first one was a withdrawal from Binance to an anonymous blockchain wallet. Besides, data shared by XRP-centered explorer Bithomp shows that 139 million XRP were actually transferred between two wallets that belong to the Binance exchange too. The destination of the 300 million XRP transfer was also an address affiliated with Binance; therefore, they were both merely internal transfers made by the largest crypto trading platform.\n\nAlmost 100 million XRP transferred by Ripple\n\nThe most recent tweet published by Whale Alert showcases two transactions, carrying 70,000,000 XRP and 27,800,000 XRP \u2013 the equivalents of $43,171,395 and $17,198,375 in fiat currency.\n\nThe 70-million transfer was conducted by Ripple fintech heavyweight \u2013 it moved these funds in an unknown direction. The 27.8 million transfer was initiated by an unidentified wallet and sent to the Bitstamp cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBithomp has revealed, however, that the former transaction was moved to a wallet belonging to Ripple, making it an internal XRP transfer. As for the latter, according to Bithomp, it was a transfer made by a Ripple-connected wallet to Bitstamp. This exchange is among those cryptocurrency trading platforms that collaborate with Ripple to support \u201cRipple Payments\u201d platform, which runs on RippleNet and ensures fast and low-cost transnational payments using XRP. Until the fall of this year, it used to be widely known as On-Demand Liquidity. Ripple chose to rebrand it so as to make it easier to understand for those customers and users who are not familiar with crypto and are not tech-minded."

        "title": "Pac-12 Collapse Will Have Ripple Effects on College Basketball - Front Office Sports",
        "content": "This season, the Pac-12 as we know it will host a college basketball season for the last time. After the conference dissolves, the landscape of the sport will change.\n\nConference realignment moves were made in the pursuit of increased revenue from football-based TV contracts. But D-I college basketball will undergo major changes, from changing rivalries to increased physical and mental strain for athletes with travel.\n\nThe ultimate fate of the Pac-12 is unclear \u2014 the two remaining members, Washington State and Oregon State, are embroiled in litigation to determine whether they can take control of the conference\u2019s assets to try to rebuild it. It\u2019s also possible that the Mountain West could invite the two schools and take over the Pac-12\u2019s name, as FOS previously reported.\n\nBut the conference, long known as a men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball powerhouse, will look much different, even if it survives. Some of those storied basketball programs, including USC, UCLA, and Stanford, have now joined conferences in the Big Ten and ACC that span coast-to-coast.\n\nAt this point, men\u2019s basketball coaches\u2019 biggest concern is travel logistics, National Association of Basketball Coaches executive director Craig Robinson told Front Office Sports. Coaches nationwide spoke out in press conferences and on social media to voice their disdain for being dragged along to a new conference because of football.\n\nBoth men\u2019s and women\u2019s seasons span two semesters and require multiple games per week, meaning athletes will travel much more often than football teams.\n\n\u201cYou have to be very intentional in trying to make it so that it doesn\u2019t put the student-athlete in a precarious position from a health standpoint, from a mental health standpoint, and an academic standpoint,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be tough for the student-athlete.\u201d\n\nAt Big East media day in October, coaches expressed relief that they didn\u2019t have to deal with the realignment headache.\n\n\u201cWhen they talk about student welfare and, you know, travel \u2014 just think about this: Stanford is in the ACC,\u201d Georgetown men\u2019s coach Ed Cooley told reporters at Big East Media day.\n\nAdministrators like ACC commissionerJim Phillips have promised \u201ccreative\u201d scheduling models that will decrease travel time. UCLA promised millions in extra travel spending and mental health resources for athletes to help with the new daunting schedules. But overall, the fears of coaches and athletes have not been assuaged.\n\n\u201cOther conferences \u2014 they\u2019re diminishing the importance of geography,\u201d Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman told FOS. \u201cWe\u2019ll be interested to see how that works out for them.\u201d\n\nWhile new rivalries will undoubtedly emerge, it will be more difficult \u2014 though not impossible \u2014 to keep traditional ones going.\n\nSome, like USC-UCLA, will be able to continue under a new conference umbrella. But others, like Oregon-Oregon State, are being ripped apart.\n\nRobinson explained these traditions will only survive if schools agree to contracts to play each other during the non-conference portion of their season. Georgetown, for example, plays an annual non-conference matchup against traditional foe Syracuse \u2014 reinvigorating the rivalry in 2015.\n\nOne bright spot: the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Division I NCAA tournaments will likely remain unchanged. Given the uncertainty around the future of the Pac-12, it\u2019s unclear how many conferences will have automatic bids going forward (each conference champion gets a spot in the tournaments). But ultimately, the ranking system will continue as is, and the number of teams making into the tournaments should be unaffected.\n\nWhile the final season of the current basketball world gets underway, the NABC, for its part, is still advocating to get men\u2019s basketball coaches more of a say in the future of college sports. Robinson says the organization has made some progress. But the recent round of realignment shows basketball, even as the second-most lucrative sport, is often an afterthought.\n\n\u201cYou could have every single coach say, \u2018We don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u2019\u201d Robinson said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a good idea financially, and for the institution, and for the ecosystem \u2014 it\u2019s going to take place.\u201d"
