        "title": "The Tokenization Revolution - Ripple",
        "content": "Tokenization of real-world assets like stocks, bonds, carbon credits and more is fast becoming the driving force behind many of today\u2019s most innovative businesses. Because these assets are stored on a blockchain, the benefits of transaction speed, liquidity, cost-savings and round-the-clock access have made it one of fintech\u2019s most promising blockchain use cases.\n\nBuilding on an early wave of adoption in art and gaming, the process of representing real-world assets such as financial instruments or real estate as digital assets on a blockchain is gaining momentum across a wide range of industries. Boston Consulting Group predicts real-world asset tokenization will be a $16 trillion industry by 2030. And Bank of America has already reported that the tokenized gold market is now more than $1 billion.\n\nGlobal financial leaders agree; an impressive 72% of participants in Ripple\u2019s 2023 New Value report survey expect to use tokenization in their businesses over the next three years. A new visualization from that same report shows 80% believe the technology will significantly impact the trading of assets, real estate transactions and derivatives, and carbon markets.\n\nGrowing range of tokenization use cases\n\nAt its core, tokenization helps unlock liquidity from even the most illiquid asset classes. In particular, New Value report respondents emphasized benefits of 24/7/365 market access, improved security and data protection, enhanced financial agility and increased efficiency through tokenization.\n\nAdditionally, tokenization can significantly reduce transaction costs as well as intermediary costs like management fees and insurance. Digital assets are also much better suited for programmability and automation than traditional assets, and the underlying blockchain technology ensures full transparency and immutability of the ownership and exchange of tokenized assets.\n\nThese powerful advantages are why Bank of America labeled tokenization a \u201ckey driver of digital asset adoption\u201d and the reason why leading banks and enterprises are already embracing it. In late 2022, JPMorgan executed its first live trade using tokenized Japanese yen and Singapore dollars as a part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s pilot program, Project Guardian. In the U.S., the State of California announced a blockchain pilot for a new DMV identification program earlier this year. Innovators are exploring the use of tokenization on the XRP Ledger for real-world assets like NFTs in real estate and carbon credits.\n\nMarc Beckman, a Senior Metaverse Fellow and Adjunct Professor at New York University, predicts the benefits of tokenization will lead to significant growth in the number and type of digital assets in the coming years: \u201cIts reach stretches from automotive titles and land deeds, even to consumer lifestyle sectors such as wine and spirits.\u201d Almost anything can be tokenized, but real-world assets \u2014 particularly illiquid assets \u2014 are top of mind because of the massive efficiency gains associated with blockchain technology.\n\nCBDCs as a turning point\n\nOf course, that reality requires traction beyond the early pilots underway today. For the next phase of growth to occur and tokenization to truly live up to its potential, financial innovators must first demonstrate adoption for more traditional assets like currency, equities, stocks and bonds. It will also necessitate the development of protocols and marketplaces upon which these tokens can be created and exchanged.\n\nEstablished cryptocurrency stablecoins like Tether and USD \u2013 an asset class that topped $7.4 billion in trading volume in 2022 \u2013 are proof that tokenization can work at scale and can serve as inspiration. The exploration of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) by 90% of the world\u2019s central banks could also be the inflection point that accelerates the tokenization boom.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll soon see advanced derivatives and options, algorithm-based complexities that we haven\u2019t yet discovered, all of which will be built on a blockchain foundation,\u201d says Ripple\u2019s Head of Liquidity Products Brad Chase. \u201cBringing assets on-chain is just step one.\u201d\n\nThe future of business is tokenized\n\nReal-world asset tokenization is far more than just a fad; it represents a fundamental shift in business operations. Built on a blockchain foundation, tokenization unlocks liquidity, transparency, simplicity and automation for both financial institutions and enterprises. It underpins an Internet of Value in which digital assets are seamlessly integrated into the existing systems so they can move as freely as information does today.\n\nDownload the 2023 New Value Report to learn more or contact our sales team to see how you can get started."

        "title": "Judge Kenneth Ripple transitions to emeritus status after 46 years of teaching ND Law students | The Law School ... - Notre Dame Law School",
        "content": "The Honorable Kenneth F. Ripple transitioned to emeritus status this summer after devoting 46 years to teaching constitutional law, conflict of laws, federal courts, and judicial process to generations of students as a member of the Notre Dame Law School faculty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Notre Dame Law School without the presence of Judge Ripple,\u201d Joseph A. Matson Dean and Professor of Law G. Marcus Cole said. \u201cHe has been a steadfast fixture for our students and faculty, as well as the people who rely on his judgment in the Seventh Circuit.\u201d\n\nRipple joined the Law School\u2019s faculty in 1977 and continued teaching even after he was appointed in 1985 to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. By the time he was appointed to the Seventh Circuit, the Law School\u2019s graduating classes had already voted him Distinguished Professor of the Year five times, and his former students remain eager to explain why.\n\nAve Maria School of Law Professor Mollie A. Murphy \u201980 J.D. was among Ripple\u2019s very first students.\n\n\u201cI was fortunate to take three courses with him,\u201d she said, \u201cincluding one of my favorites \u2014 Constitutional Litigation \u2014 and to serve as his research assistant in my third year.\u201d Ripple, she said, was a superb teacher right out of the gate, \u201cknowledgeable, organized, and taking care to show you not only the specific concepts of the subject matter area, but the overall structure in which they fit.\u201d\n\nAs significant as the substantive law that she learned from Ripple were \u201cthe habits of an excellent lawyer \u2014 a strong work ethic, the need for thorough analysis and attention to detail, and the importance of precise articulation of legal concepts.\u201d And most importantly of all, she said, was that \u201che provided a role model \u2014 a model of integrity, a man who valued faith and family, as well as the institutions of the law. After law school, he continued to be a mentor and friend.\u201d\n\nGregory G. Murphy \u201979 J.D. practices law in Billings, Mont. He recalls that when he took Ripple\u2019s Constitutional Law course as a second-year law student, the new professor, in just his third year on the faculty, had already established himself as a student favorite. \u201cHe was well-recognized by the students as a constitutional scholar of the first rank and was viewed as a kind and gentle man, albeit no pushover. Everyone recognized that he was extremely diligent and worked long hours. He bore an air of absolute rectitude. He obviously liked his students, and they liked him.\u201d\n\nMurphy vividly remembers the moment Ripple admonished his graduating class to build cathedrals with their lives. \u201dBy this,\u201d Murphy said, \u201che was telling us to build something glorious, beautiful, and dedicated to the Lord.\u201d He also treasures the memory of the keynote address Ripple delivered to the Class of 1979 at their 40th reunion. \u201cWe were tremendously impressed by how much he remembered about our class, but even more by how much effort he must have put forth in preparing his remarks, which were full of wisdom and kindness. We very much appreciated him.\u201d\n\nFrom left, Judge Michael S. Kanne, Judge Kenneth F. Ripple, and Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit speak to students on February 3, 2020. Professor Roger Alford is at the podium.\n\nNotre Dame Law School faculty members are no less appreciative of their colleague.\n\nProfessor Emeritus Fernand N. \u201cTex\u201d Dutile \u201965 J.D. participated in the interview process that brought Ripple to Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cDespite my strong confidence even back then that he would be a wonderful addition to our enterprise, I could not have imagined just how much he would mean to Notre Dame Law School,\u201d Dutile said.\n\n\u201cFor almost half a century he has been a superb colleague, a dedicated and brilliant scholar-teacher, and a valued friend. If during all that time there has been a better lawyer exemplar for our students, that name does not come to mind. He has wonderfully modeled the competence, preparation, civility, devotion, and caring that we so wish our students to bring to their professional lives,\u201d Dutile said.\n\n\u201cCounting him as colleague and friend has been a significant part of my career at Notre Dame.\u201d\n\nIntellectual and ideological diversity has long been an important component of the Notre Dame Law School experience, and one that sets it apart from many law schools. In this regard, Professor Emeritus John H. Robinson greatly valued Ripple\u2019s steadfast and warm collegiality.\n\n\u201cWay back in the last millennium,\u201d Robinson said, \u201cKen was widely known to be a conservative just as I was widely known to be a liberal. In all the years during which, as colleagues, we addressed all sorts of issues that arose in the Law School, never once did our substantial political differences get in the way of our collaborating on the issue at hand.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the Notre Dame Law Association presented Hon. Kenneth F. Ripple with the McCafferty Award for Service. He is pictured here speaking at the ceremony.\n\nRipple graduated summa cum laude with an A.B. from Fordham University in 1965, received his J.D. from the University of Virginia in 1968, and earned an LL.M. summa cum laude in administrative law and economic regulation from the National Law Center of the George Washington University in 1972. Before joining the Notre Dame faculty, he served as the legal officer of the U.S. Supreme Court (1972-73) and as special assistant to the chief justice of the United States (1973-77). He also practiced law in the Office of the General Counsel of IBM, and as a branch head for the Judge Advocate General of the Navy.\n\nThen, eight years after joining the Notre Dame faculty, he was nominated by President Reagan to serve as a judge on the U.S Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Loath to cut his close ties to the Law School, Judge Ripple determined to remain a member of the faculty, and to continue teaching as a part-time professor. He also continued to earn University honors. In addition to being voted Distinguished Professor of the Year on five occasions by the Law School\u2019s graduating classes, he was presented with the Special Presidential Award in 1985, and the Rev. Michael D. McCafferty Award for Service to Notre Dame Law School in 2014.\n\n\u201cMy Notre Dame years were grace-filled ones,\u201d said Ripple. \u201cI am very thankful for all the wonderful friendships that I have with colleagues and former students, and look forward to continuing those friendships in the time ahead.\u201d"
