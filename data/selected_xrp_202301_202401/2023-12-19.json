        "content": "One of the largest payment-processing companies in the world, Mastercard, has announced a partnership with Ripple that could catapult the value of XRP. Indeed, the two entities have joined forces with the digital asset, seeking to get some positive momentum to close out what has been a very positive 2023.\n\nThe partnership was announced at the tail end of last month and could coincide with a greater surge in the asset price. Indeed, it may well be on its way to breaking through the current value of $0.6 and rallying as we head into the new year.\n\nSource: BBC\n\nAlso Read: Ripple XRP Price Prediction For Christmas Day\n\nRipple and Mastercard Set to Propel an XRP Rally?\n\nThis past year has undeniably been a positive one for Ripple. The asset has seen its long-fought court battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) near its conclusion. Moreover, it is seemingly set to emerge victorious. Altogether, the stars are aligned for what could be a breakout in the coming year.\n\nA key part of that is the recently announced Rippel and Mastercard partnership, which could do wonders for XRP. Indeed, both companies have opted to collaborate to deliver cryptocurrency debit cards. The offering will allow Mastercard to delve deep into the crypto space while exposing XRP to the greater traditional finance sector.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple\u2019s XRP Predicted to Rally 1500%: Here\u2019s When\n\nSubsequently, the collaboration could continue to push Ripple closer to the $0.70 price point. The XRP token has regained $0.60, but is struggling to move higher. Still, the year has certainly been a positive one for the asset. Throughout 2023, it has boasted a 47.7% increase in its overall value.\n\nThe coming year is a vital one for XRP to continue its upward trajectory. The asset is relying heavily on similar partnerships as it continues to be a blockchain industry leader. Moreover, the impending resolution of its SEC case should eventually aid it marvelously, as it is poised for a breakthrough."

        "content": "Tue 19 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nCardano\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson, is against any collaboration that involves the Cardano blockchain and Ripple\u2019s XRP. In a recent media appearance, the CEO revisited the reasons behind this stance, which he seems unwilling to change.\n\nReasons Related to the Lack of Crypto Alignment Between Cardano and Ripple\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, remains firm in his rejection of any partnership with Ripple\u2019s XRP. According to him, the reasons for this staunch opposition stem from a lack of technological alignment between the two platforms.\n\nBut the head also cites the ongoing harassment from the XRP community. The situation exacerbates the relationship between the Cardano founder and the XRP community, characterized by mutual disdain and fairly frequent attacks.\n\nIt should be noted that the history of discord between Hoskinson and the XRP community has resurfaced recently. Particularly when an XRP user reminded him of a critical comment he made a year ago, calling the XRP community \u201ctoxic and petty.\u201d\n\nDavid Schwartz, the Chief Technical Officer of Ripple, then intervened to ask Hoskinson to reconsider his stance. But the Cardano founder\u2019s response remained unchanged, with a clear disapproval of potential partnerships.\n\nTwo years of daily harassment by the community, the lack of technical overlap between Cardano and XRP, and the different product market fit.\n\n\n\nProjects like Tezos, Algorand, Polkadot, Ethereum, and Cardano are solving similar problems. Ripple is built for a different purpose. The\u2026 \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 17, 2023 Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, strongly expresses his opposition to any partnership with Ripple\n\nCharles Hoskinson Mentions XRP\u2019s Inclinations Towards CBDCs\n\nIf the Cardano CEO does not wish to be associated with Ripple and its XRP, it is because of the ends pursued by that blockchain. He believes that XRP serves a distinct purpose as an interbank settlement system and a CBDC framework.\n\nThis, in his view, is contrary to the visions of other crypto platforms like Ethereum, Polkadot, or Algorand. Each one contributing in its uniqueness, to solving similar problems.\n\nHighlighting these fundamental differences with Cardano\u2019s ADA, Charles Hoskinson stated that collaboration with the XRP community was unlikely. This is due to the \u201cpersistent personal attacks, harassment, and the complete inability to have a conversation.\u201d\n\nIt should be mentioned that the Cardano CEO particularly contributes to aggravating the situation. Since, as he himself admitted, he attacks the XRP community with memes like ETHGate. Thus, labeling the members of the XRP community as \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d This raises questions about the potential for future collaboration between Cardano and Ripple\u2019s XRP.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, has reaffirmed the company\u2019s commitment to bankroll pro-crypto candidates in the 2024 US election cycle financially.\n\nThe post shared by Brad Garlinghouse on X comes as a much-needed booster in the ongoing efforts by leaders in the crypto ecosystem to raise funds to finance lawmakers that can help usher in responsible regulation in the country.\n\nWhile previous election cycles have welcomed support from some crypto leaders, personalized financing like the ones linked to FTX founder Sam Bankman-fried led to social and regulatory backlash.\n\nTeam @Ripple is putting a stake in the ground, leading the charge with other industry leaders to support pro-innovation and pro-crypto candidates in the 2024 US election cycle.

The regulator\u2019s enforcement action started earlier in the year with Kraken, whom it accused of offering its staking service as an unregistered security.\n\nThe $30 million settlement reached at the time did not deter the Gary Gensler-led commission from filing another lawsuit against the trading platform some weeks back.\n\nThe lawsuit between the agency and Ripple also intensified this year. As the case is wrapping up, both parties have bagged mixed victories. While Ripple\u2019s executives, including Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, have been absolved of wrongdoing, the court labeled the company guilty of selling XRP to institutional investors as security.\n\nAmidst these developments, Garlinghouse believes the crypto ecosystem needs to advance leaders who will \u201cchampion innovation and spearhead paths towards responsible regulation.\u201d\n\nTeam @Ripple is putting a stake in the ground, leading the charge with other industry leaders to support pro-innovation and pro-crypto candidates in the 2024 US election cycle.

        "title": "Meet the Electric-Powered Snowboard We're Still Not Sure We Need - GearJunkie",
        "content": "If you've dreamed of traveling at moderate speeds on flat snow, then the Cyrusher Ripple electric snowboard was likely made with you in mind.\n\nSay hello to the Cyrusher Ripple, an electric snowboard that speeds up to 31 mph on flat terrain; (photo/Cyrusher)\n\nDo you like snowboarding, but wish that it was slower, flatter, and required less effort? Then the Cyrusher Ripple, one of the world\u2019s first mass-produced electric snowboards, might just fit the bill.\n\nThis improbable invention is the latest motorized device from Cyrusher, a Utah-based company mostly known for its variety of e-bikes. Cyrusher has embraced the popularity of putting a motor on just about anything, venturing into the water with an electric surfboard. Now, it\u2019s trying out snow-based transportation.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who, exactly, this electric snowboard is meant to please. Most resorts like Vail and Aspen do not allow motorized anything on their slopes. The Ripple doesn\u2019t seem to have enough power for steep hills (a staple selling point for e-bikes), either. On top of all of that, it also requires users to carry a medium-size battery in their backpack while \u201cshredding.\u201d\n\nPlay\n\nPerhaps it packs more of a wallop than the specs or the company\u2019s YouTube introduction suggest. But since debuting a few weeks ago, many questions linger about the board\u2019s effectiveness, and where it could actually be used.\n\n\u201cWill these even be allowed on most ski slopes? My guess would be probably not,\u201d Jeffrey Clos wrote in a Medium review. \u201cYou may have to stick to the backtrails with this particular beauty.\u201d\n\nCyrusher Ripple Electric Snowboard: Features\n\nThe Ripple weighs 33 pounds, and the company recommends carrying it as shown above; (photo/Cyrusher)\n\nAccording to company specs, the Ripple comes with a 3,000W motor, offering speeds up to 31 mph. It can supposedly handle gentle inclines of 20 degrees or less. So it\u2019s not powerful enough to access truly steep and deep backcountry terrain. This board is better suited for cross-country trails and gentle tours.\n\nIt is also wicked heavy. The board alone weighs 33 pounds (most normal snowboards weigh 5-9 pounds). GearJunkie reached out to Cyrusher to find out how much the battery weighs, and whether that is included in the listed weight, but we didn\u2019t hear back from the brand by the time we published this article.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s probably safe to call the Ripple one of the heaviest commercial snowboards on the market. That\u2019s likely part of the reason Cyrusher emphasizes the \u201cjoy of boarding on flat snowfields\u201d in the video above.\n\nThe Ripple comes with an adjustable suspension system to accommodate different rider weights and terrain; (photo/Cyrusher)\n\nThe board also comes with an adjustable suspension system for absorbing vibration, and it\u2019s customizable for the rider\u2019s weight or varied terrain. Power comes from a portable lithium-ion battery pack tethered to a backpack. The estimated travel range is 9.3 to 12.4 miles, with a recharge time of a few hours. The battery can also double as a charger for electronic devices.\n\nA potential selling point lies in the comparison with snowmobiles, which often burn gas and make a lot of noise. The Ripple is meant to be a quieter, more eco-friendly option \u2014 albeit with a much smaller range, and far more limited power.\n\nCyrusher Ripple: Pricing & Availability\n\nThe bindings cost about $300 extra, but the whole setup (board, battery, and bindings) is currently on sale; (photo/Cyrusher)\n\nThe Cyrusher Ripple electric snowboard and battery are available for $2,500. If you want the bindings included, it\u2019s $2,900. But if you make your purchase before Wednesday, December 20, the brand is offering the Ripple board for a $300 discount.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine electric snowboards reaching anything like the popularity of e-bikes \u2014 especially when their accessible terrain is so limited. But this is the first iteration. If Cyrusher continues refining its design, the board could get lighter, the battery could get smaller, and the capability of the Ripple could improve to handle more than gently sloped hills.\n\nVisit the Cyrusher website to learn more about the Ripple, or to check out its other electrically powered products."

        "content": "On 19 December 2023, Monica Long, the President of Ripple, shared her predictions for the cryptocurrency landscape in 2024 on social media platform X. Her insights reflect a vision of significant evolution and maturation in the crypto industry.\n\nHere\u2019s a detailed breakdown of her key predictions and statements:\n\nBreaking the Speculative Hype Cycle: Long anticipates that 2024 will mark the end of the recurring cycles of extreme highs and lows, often driven by speculative hype, that have characterized the crypto industry since Bitcoin\u2019s inception. She believes this change will precede the next \u2018crypto summer.\u2019 Foundation for Real-World Utility: The focus, according to Long, will shift towards establishing a foundation for practical, real-world applications of cryptocurrency. This involves addressing key challenges like compliance, usability, and integration with existing financial systems. Pioneering Compliance in Decentralized Finance: Long predicts that the most significant breakthrough in 2024 will be in the area of compliance, particularly within decentralized finance (DeFi). This suggests a move towards more regulated and secure DeFi environments. Crypto Winter as an Opportunity: She views the current \u2018crypto winter\u2019 \u2013 a period of market downturn \u2013 as an advantageous time for dedicated developers. This period is seen as an opportunity to focus on solving substantial, real-world problems using blockchain technology. Emphasis on Compliance and Transparency: Long stresses that in 2024, the crypto industry needs to prioritize compliance to ensure customer and user safety. This shift is crucial for regaining trust lost due to past industry setbacks. Developing compliance tools within a decentralized framework is seen as a key area of innovation. Integration with Traditional Finance: Long notes the recent trend of traditional financial giants like Fidelity, BlackRock, PayPal, and Visa collaborating with crypto-native companies. She envisions a synergistic relationship where blockchain technology complements rather than replaces traditional banking systems. Benefits of Instant Cross-border Payments: She highlights the advantages of blockchain in enabling instant, cross-border payments without the need for intermediaries, benefiting both merchants and consumers. Focus on Greater Usability: Long points out that while many of Ripple\u2019s partners appreciate the benefits of crypto, they do not wish to become crypto experts themselves. She emphasizes the need for crypto solutions that are easy to use and do not require users to manage their assets or navigate complex trading platforms. Mainstream Recognition and Institutional Adoption: Long acknowledges that cryptocurrency has reached a point of mainstream recognition. However, she believes that 2024 could be the year when institutional adoption for practical utility truly takes off, provided the industry maintains a compliance-first approach.\n\nApproximately two weeks after Judge Torres\u2019s significant ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple Labs case, Monica Long discussed Ripple\u2019s partial victory in the lawsuit and its expanding international presence with CNBC. Long expressed her satisfaction with the court\u2019s decision, which she noted has provided essential clarity for Ripple\u2019s operations. According to Long, this verdict has enabled Ripple to re-engage with the U.S. market. However, she also emphasized that much of Ripple\u2019s growth has occurred outside the U.S., particularly in regions with well-defined regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies.\n\nLong identified the UK, Europe, Singapore, and Dubai as key regions that have established clear regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. She attributed significant growth in Ripple\u2019s business in these areas, especially in payment services, to these clear frameworks. Focusing on the UK, Long described it as a major hub for fintech and a country where Ripple is looking to increase its investment, in line with the UK\u2019s ambition to become a leading crypto hub with specific regulations for crypto companies. She noted that Ripple\u2019s presence in London has grown substantially, with the office more than doubling in size.\n\nFurther, Long mentioned Ripple\u2019s extensive customer base across Europe and the Middle East, with Dubai being another crucial office location. She also pointed out Ripple\u2019s growth in Asia and Latin America. Long specifically highlighted Latin America, with a significant office in Sao Paulo, as a region that is becoming increasingly vital for Ripple\u2019s operations."
