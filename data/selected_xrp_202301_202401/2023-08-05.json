        "content": "Norwegian boat builder Frydenb\u00f8 Marine and startup Pascal Technologies launch Ripple Boats, a long-range electric boat brand.\n\nRipple Boats is looking towards the future of boating, creating a vessel that promises fun without compromising the environment. The brand looks to design and build the next generation of long-range electric boats for the recreational market.\n\nNorwegian boat builder Frydenb\u00f8 Marine is one of the largest boat produces in the Nordics, covering brands like Nordkapp, Sting, and Airborne boats, in addition to distribution for Zodiac. Frydenb\u00f8 looks to use their quality manufacturing capacity to support Ripple Boats.\n\nPascal Technologies, Frydenb\u00f8\u2019s partner in Ripple Boats, is a marine tech startup developing an energy-efficient solution for leisure boats based on an air cushion principle. Pascal\u2019s technology pumps air between the hull and water, reducing the water resistance and extending range.\n\nRipple Boats\u2019 first model will be a 10-meter electric day cruiser designed by award winning designer Thorup Design. The brand\u2019s vessels have been designed to cater to a multitude of water-based activities and include user-friendly technology like automatic anchor handling, remote monitoring, and over-the-air updates. Pascal\u2019s air cushion technology is also included, extending the range of each vessel.\n\n\u201cOver the coming years we aim to build a series of models in the 6-11 metre range, with a focus on international sales and not just in our \u2018home market\u2019 of Scandinavia,\u201d said Stian Gulla, CEO of Ripple Boats. \u201cThe leisure boat industry and electrification is at an inflection point. Consumer sentiment is changing, battery costs are coming down and investment in the space is growing rapidly, both from established players and startups.\u201d\n\nTriton\u2019s new Tech issue is now out!

        "title": "Ripple whales dump 100 million XRP as XRP price suffers the waning bullishness of SEC lawsuit win - FXStreet",
        "content": "XRP price has declined by almost 25% in the span of two weeks after marking 2023 highs of $0.85 last month.\n\nWhale addresses holding 100,000 to 1 million XRP have sold more than 100 million XRP in the same duration to take profits.\n\nThis profit-taking might come to a stop now and reignite accumulation amongst investors as the altcoin is currently in the \u201copportunity zone\u201d as per the MVRV ratio.\n\nXRP price made a historic rally after securing a partial win last month, but that bullishness now seems to be going away. The cryptocurrency has lost a significant chunk of the recent gains as whales shifted from HODLing to profit-taking. But the altcoin still has a shot to minimize the damage before it loses another key support level.\n\nXRP price loses steam due to profit taking\n\nXRP price is currently trading at $0.619, falling by almost 25% in the span of two weeks after marking 2023 highs of $0.85 in July. The year-to-date high was achieved following a 73% rally in the span of a week after Judge Torres granted Ripple a partial win in the SEC lawsuit.\n\nXRP/USD 1-day chart\n\nThis triggered whales and large wallet holders to make the most of the situation finally, and the investors began dumping their holdings to take profits. Between July 19 and the time of writing, the supply of addresses holding 100,000 XRP to 1 million XRP declined from 6.85 billion XRP to 6.75 billion XRP.\n\nXRP whale holding\n\nThis 100 million XRP is worth about $61.8 million and could have been a catalyst in the decline observed recently. Furthermore, the ruling that propelled XRP price last month is also feared to be reversed since Judge Torres only granted XRP the label of \u201cnot a security\u201d in the case of public sales and not institutional sales.\n\nRegardless, the concern surrounding the same could lead to some pullback from investors in the market which would prove to be good for XRP price. The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio can be seen lurking around -12% below the threshold for the opportunity zone.\n\nXRP MVRV ratio\n\nMVRV is a measure of the overall profit/loss of investors, and the opportunity zone represents a shift from selling to potential accumulation from investors. In the case of XRP, this area lies below the -10% mark and suggests a recovery in XRP price provided it still stands above the key support level of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA)."

        "title": "As Crazy As It Sounds, XRP May Hit $100 Based On These Key Driving Factors - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nShannon Thorp, a renowned Wells Fargo Analyst, recently shared a bold forecast for XRP, the native digital asset of the Ripple network, on Twitter.\n\nDrawing on her meticulous calculations and considering various factors, Thorp presented a conservative short-term price prediction for XRP, suggesting that its value could range between $100 and $500 in the near short term (the next four to seven months).\n\nTo arrive at this prediction, Thorp considered several key variables that could influence XRP\u2019s future, including an analysis of the cryptocurrency\u2019s circulation and adoption by banks, liquidity providers, and governments. By evaluating these aspects, she projected the potential liquidity strength (LS) of XRP, suggesting it could reach trillions of dollars if widely utilized across various financial institutions.\n\nThe pundit also took into account the recent ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, the recent FedNow announcement, and the proposed crypto regulation bill currently under Senate consideration, which according to her, are a step in the right direction for XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, she emphasized the importance of XRP\u2019s application in messaging and settling as crucial in determining its trajectory.\n\nThorp\u2019s prediction wasn\u2019t solely based on charts and technical analysis; she underscored the significance of considering XRP\u2019s potential utility and widespread adoption. According to Thorp, XRP\u2019s rapid settlement times and low transaction fees make it a promising candidate for cross-border transactions and various other financial applications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAddressing Divisions within the XRP Community\n\nMeanwhile, despite the bold price prediction, Thorp expressed concerns about the XRP community\u2019s differing approaches to predicting its future.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, now more than ever I see a divided XRPArmy! One side looking at only charts, taking cues from the past and trends that follow Bitcoin to draw short term price predictions. Whilst others cling to utility, believing that partnerships and the replacement of antiquated systems will drive price,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cXRP, for those not in the know is NOT a security! Why would we continue to pretend it is and make price predictions based on \u201cSecurities\u201d in the crypto space? This logic seems counter intuitive and holds back what the team Ripple set off to do so many years ago.\u201d\n\nThorp then challenged both approaches, asserting that neither has proven fully accurate and encouraged a broader perspective to unlock the true potential of XRP.\n\nThat said, Thorp\u2019s positive forecast for XRP\u2019s future underscores the rising significance of XRP in the global financial landscape. The increasing demand for XRP from banks using it for wire transfers, coupled with the limited supply of around 50 billion out of 100 billion, is expected to drive a substantial price increase. Moreover, developments like Ripple\u2019s recent creation of a mortgage branch on the XRP ledger add further impetus to the cryptocurrency\u2019s upward trajectory."
