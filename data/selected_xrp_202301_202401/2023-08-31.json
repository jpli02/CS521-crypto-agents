        "content": "XRP got legal clarity from Judge Torres\u2019 ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, but since the news the altcoin has wiped out all gains.\n\nXRP whales holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 XRP tokens have shed their holdings over the past two months.\n\nRipple XRP price is tethered to 200-day EMA at $0.5251, the altcoin faces the possibility of a 7% decline.\n\nXRP price dropped and wiped out all its gains from Judge Torres' ruling that offered Ripple a partial victory in the lawsuit brought forward by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP is one of the only altcoins in the crypto ecosystem, after Bitcoin and Ethereum, to receive legal clarity in a lawsuit ruling.\n\nWhales have consistently shed their holdings of the token over the past two months, adding to the selling pressure on the asset.\n\nAlso read: XRP price risks decline to $0.41, amidst developments in SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit\n\nRipple XRP price wipes out all gains despite legal clarity\n\nIn the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, Judge Torres declared a partial win for the payment firm and considered XRP a \u201cnon-security.\u201d Following Judge Torres\u2019 ruling, Judge Failla in the recent Uniswap lawsuit referred to Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities and not \u201csecurities\u201d.\n\nThe legal clarity on the status of these digital assets has fueled bullish sentiment among the crypto community of holders and acted as a bullish catalyst for asset prices. However, in the case of XRP, the price gains were wiped out soon enough with developments in the lawsuit and other macroeconomic developments in the economy.\n\nXRP price resumed its downward trend, and the asset is currently tethered to its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.5251.\n\nXRP price decline supported by on-chain metric\n\nWhale accumulation is considered a typical bullish indicator. Similarly, when whales shed their holdings of an asset, it foreshadows an upcoming correction in the asset. XRP whales holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 XRP tokens have consistently reduced their token holdings and redistributed them, adding to the selling pressure on the asset.\n\nThis chart from on-chain intelligence tracker Santiment shows the state of whale holdings over the past two months.\n\nWhales holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 XRP tokens vs price\n\nXRP price risks 7% decline\n\nLockridge Okoth, a technical analyst at FXStreet, analyzed the XRP price chart and noted that the altcoin needs to break its tether to the 200-day EMA at $0.5251 to make the next move. Since August 18, XRP price has been in a state of consolidation, and there is a probability of dipping into the demand zone between $0.5040 and $0.4600. A decisive daily candlestick close below the mean threshold at $0.4800 strengthens the downward trend of the asset, and XRP risks a drop to $0.4191.\n\nXRP/USDT one-day price chart on Binance\n\nIf XRP price breaches the 50 and 100-day EMAs at $0.5813 and $0.5646, a sustained uptrend to the $0.6840 level is likely."

        "title": "Ripple: This Is How XRP Holders Can Earn Passive Income with New Sidechain from XRPL Ecosystem - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "A top market expert has shed new light on an opportunity for XRP community members to earn passive income.\n\nHis idea is hinged on leveraging emerging AMMs on the XRPL to become Liquidity Providers (LPs)\n\nPanos Mekras, a distinguished Financial Consultant and the Founder of DigitalGen has recently shed light on an enticing prospect for XRP holders to harness passive income through the upcoming XRP Ledger (XRPL) Automated Market Maker (AMM).\n\nAt the core of Mekras\u2019 insights lies the significance of on-chain liquidity and the pivotal role that AMMs play in maintaining it. Liquidity is a cornerstone of any functioning market, fundamentally influencing asset prices. AMMs, including those integrated into decentralized exchanges, facilitate this liquidity through liquidity pools, where funds are locked within smart contracts to facilitate token swapping.\n\nCrucially, Mekras emphasizes the crucial role of Liquidity Providers (LPs) who contribute to these liquidity pools. These LPs deposit their assets into these pools, increasing liquidity while also collecting a portion of the trading fees produced by these pools. This distinct function allows LPs to develop and sustain a liquid market while reaping a passive revenue stream.\n\nMekras goes further to suggest that members of the XRP community could actively assume the role of LPs. By doing so, XRP holders have the opportunity to engage with the XRPL ecosystem in a new way, contributing to the network\u2019s vitality while reaping the rewards of trading fees.\n\nWhat makes this opportunity particularly attractive is the potential for passive income. As LPs, XRP community members could earn a portion of the fees generated by the XRPL AMM. This passive income could serve as a rewarding incentive for individuals who wish to be more actively involved in the ecosystem while capitalizing on their existing XRP holdings.\n\nMekras\u2019 insights not only highlight the potential financial benefits but also contribute to the broader discourse surrounding decentralized finance. As the crypto landscape matures, mechanisms like XRPL\u2019s AMM and the participation of community members as liquidity providers help shape a more robust and sustainable ecosystem.\n\nXRP Income Strategy: Reevaluating Impermanent Loss\n\nThe concept of being an LP has often been met with trepidation due to the potential for Impermanent Loss (IL), however, Mekras has shed light on how this apparent disadvantage can actually be turned into a strategic advantage.\n\nImpermanent Loss occurs when the value of assets held in a liquidity pool undergoes changes, resulting in the pool\u2019s overall value differing from what it would have been if the assets were simply held without being part of the pool. This phenomenon arises when the prices of the tokens within the pool deviate from their initial ratio.\n\nMekras, in his comprehensive analysis, challenged the notion that IL is an insurmountable obstacle. Instead, he introduced the idea that IL can be an integral part of an effective trading strategy. To illustrate this, he proposed leveraging IL as an automated Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) approach.\n\nBy offering liquidity to a pair such as XRP stablecoin, LPs have the potential to accumulate more XRP in the midst of price fluctuations. This strategy takes advantage of IL by purchasing more XRP when the price is low and fewer when the price is high.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "title": "The ASUS TUF Gaming 850W Gold PSU Review: Tough But Fair - AnandTech",
        "content": "Power Supply Quality\n\nAs part of our testing, we also check output parameters are within specifications, as well as voltage ripple and line noise.\n\nMain Output Load (Watts) 172.95 W 431.86 W 643.96 W 857.48 W Load (Percent) 20.35% 50.81% 75.76% 100.88% Amperes Volts Amperes Volts Amperes Volts Amperes Volts 3.3 V 2.23 3.42 5.57 3.4 8.36 3.39 11.14 3.38 5 V 2.23 5.15 5.57 5.12 8.36 5.12 11.14 5.09 12 V 12.62 12.19 31.56 12.18 47.34 12.1 63.12 12.09\n\nLine Regulation\n\n(20% to 100% load) Voltage Ripple (mV) 20% Load 50% Load 75% Load 100% Load CL1\n\n12V CL2\n\n3.3V + 5V 3.3V 1.2% 18 14 18 22 16 22 5V 1.3% 20 12 18 22 16 20 12V 0.8% 28 22 26 36 30 22\n\nOverall, the electrical performance of the ASUS TUF Gaming 850W Gold PSU is very good. It has strict voltage regulation on the major 12V line, fluctuating below 0.8% across the nominal load range. Regulation is not as tight on the 3.3V/5V lines, which are at 1.2/1.4% respectively, but these still are very good performance figures. The filtering on all voltage lines is very good, with optimal results at 50% load. The maximum ripple on all voltage rails occurred at maximum load, with a ripple of 16 mV / 16 mV / 30 mV on the 3.3V / 5V / 12V lines respectively.\n\nAs part of our standard testing, we test the primary protections of all PSUs we review (Over Current, Over Voltage, Over Power, and Short Circuit). All of the protections of the ASUS TUF Gaming 850W Gold are engaged normally. The over-current and over-power protection of the unit is markedly lax, allowing the draw of more than 140% of the unit's rated current and 125% of its rated capacity for seconds before shutting the unit down.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ASUS TUF Gaming Gold power supply unit demonstrates a commendable level of build quality, underscored by the incorporation of high-quality Japanese electrolytic and solid-state capacitors. However, it is worth noting that a notable proportion of electrolytic capacitors and major active components stem from suppliers that may be unfamiliar to the seasoned observer.\n\nQuality-wise, ASUS is placing a lot of resources on the marketing of some of their products as \u201cmilitary grade\u201d equipment, which does raise the eyebrows of more experienced system builders and engineers. To begin with, military designs are minimalistic, often limited to baseline functionality, favoring low cost and resource readiness above everything else \u2013 and we can all agree that the design of the TUF Gaming 850W Gold PSU is anything but minimalistic.\n\nWhat ASUS is doing is that they are having the inductors and capacitors certified by an independent lab to verify compliance with certain standards (in this case, a US Department of Defense standard) \u2013 an undeniably nice (and costly) procedure \u2013 but, truth is, the Nippon Chemi-Con and Nichicon capacitors found in this PSU are no different than any other of the same series. All equipment manufacturers typically certify their products according to a national or international standard because these are what those involved in the commercial market typically ask for. Some could very well have certifications proving compliance with the US DoD standards as they would need those to directly or indirectly supply certain organizations \u2013 we cannot know because manufacturers typically do not publish those test reports publicly. What is certain is that every quality equipment manufacturer certifies their products according to at least one official standard, because no sane equipment procurer would publish a tender or even request a quote for parts that do not come with at least one official certification attached. Finally, the US DoD electronics standards are not actually all that strict, and most of their test methods were issued somewhere between two and six decades ago, making it easy for modern materials and manufacturing procedures to outperform their requirements.\n\nThe OEM/ODM affiliation of the ASUS TUF Gaming Gold power supply unit is with Great Wall, a sizable Chinese manufacturer whose presence in mainstream and high-end PC power supply units has emerged only recently. The external design, while captivating, maintains a balance between aesthetics and functionality without veering into the realm of extravagance.\n\nWhen evaluating power quality, the ASUS TUF Gaming Gold power supply unit offers commendable performance within its class. Its 12V line showcases precise voltage regulation, and the voltage filtering across all voltage rails is notably effective. The energy conversion efficiency surpasses the requirements stipulated by the 80Plus Gold certification, regardless of input voltage conditions.\n\nIn terms of thermal performance, the ASUS TUF Gaming Gold exhibits a noteworthy level of resistance to thermal stress. However, in demanding scenarios with extreme loads and elevated ambient temperatures, the cooling profile's relatively lax nature leads to elevated operating temperatures. In terms of acoustics, the ASUS TUF Gaming Gold power supply unit is virtually noiseless during typical operating conditions, even when subjected to substantial loads. The integrated fan remains dormant until the unit's load surpasses fifty percent of its total capacity, contributing to a serene computing environment.\n\nIn light of its features, performance, and affordability, the ASUS TUF Gaming Gold offers excellent value at its current price point of $111 in the US. This competitive pricing, combined with its compliance with the ATX 3.0 standard, positions the unit as an attractive choice for those seeking a high-performance power supply solution. Despite minor caveats, the ASUS TUF Gaming Gold stands as a compelling option, addressing the needs of PC enthusiasts and professionals alike, making it a worthy addition to the ASUS TUF Gaming lineup."

        "title": "Martha's Vineyard News | Islanders Feel Home Insurance Ripple Effect - The Vineyard Gazette - Martha's Vineyard News",
        "content": "As the national insurance market retreats from areas ravaged by wildfires and storms, Island insurance agents say Martha\u2019s Vineyard is increasingly being considered a risk by the companies writing homeowner policies.\n\nSome insurers are declining to renew either portions of home insurance or entire policies. In many cases, home insurance prices have gone up by 20 per cent or more. One Vineyard insurance agent said she has seen premiums jump 50 per cent as companies take a harder look at insuring on the Cape and Islands.\n\nThe tightening market is a result of fewer companies wanting to take on the risk of insuring an Island community with sky high real estate values at a time when major storms and fires are battering other parts of the country, agents at three Island agencies said.\n\n\u201cNationally the insurance market is in a really tough spot,\u201d said Richard Soo Hoo, the chief operating officer at Sterling Insurance in Tisbury. \u201cThe Island is really a microcosm of all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d said Paula O\u2019Connor, business manager and executive vice president at Mone Insurance in Vineyard Haven.\n\nJoe Gervais, founder and president of Tashmoo Insurance, said fewer than 5 per cent of Tashmoo\u2019s clients \u2014 about 70 homeowners \u2014 have had their plans not renewed by carriers.\n\nWhile Mone hasn\u2019t seen many carriers canceling policies yet, Ms. O\u2019Connor said the market is trending that way.\n\n\u201cThe prices are going up by thousands,\u201d she said. A 30 per cent hike isn\u2019t unheard of, and she\u2019s seen premiums on commercial properties start to double.\n\nInsurance renewals started to come in the late winter, and by spring large increases were seen almost across the board, leading to what Ms. O\u2019Connor described as a year of \u201chorror\u201d so far in 2023.\n\nAbout 30 years ago, several of the large companies stopped insuring Island homes, according to Mr. Gervais. Lloyd\u2019s of London stepped in to fill the void.\n\n\u201cOur marketplace has been dominated by Lloyd\u2019s of London for the last 10 years,\u201d Mr. Gervais said. \u201cThe household name insurance companies have not done business out here for over 30 years.\u201d\n\nNow Lloyd\u2019s, which has several companies under its umbrella, is pulling back as more destructive storms are expected in different parts of the country.\n\nInsurance companies buy what\u2019s known as reinsurance \u2014 basically a form of insurance on themselves to protect from large claims. Though the Vineyard hasn\u2019t had any major damage from a storm or other disaster in years, catastrophes elsewhere \u2014 such as tropical storm Idalia \u2014 ripple through the entire market. As reinsurance rates rise, it becomes more expensive to write insurance policies, and many insurers are simply backing out.\n\n\u201cBasically, it doesn\u2019t matter where these hurricanes hit at all, and we are going to take a hit for that,\u201d said Mr. Gervais. \u201cWe are going to suffer.\u201d\n\nNarragansett Bay Insurance stopped writing new policies as well as peeling away from existing policies here, according to Mr. Soo Hoo, and other companies are starting to offer non-standard coverage.\n\nThe remaining companies that would write new policies are limiting the number of customers they will take on because of the high cost of construction on the Island. Companies are also hesitant to take on too many new properties in one area in case a large storm were to damage all of them in one swoop.\n\n\u201cThe cost to rebuild is so high it eats up that capacity fast,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor said.\n\nFinding insurance up-Island is especially difficult because of the lack of full-time fire departments or town water, increasing the risk in the eyes of many insurers.\n\nOne homeowner in Edgartown shared a letter from their insurance agency with the Gazette. In August, AIG declined to renew a portion of the homeowner\u2019s policy related to storm damage.\n\n\u201cThe reason for nonrenewal is to reduce the Company\u2019s exposure to catastrophic losses for risks with an unacceptable exposure to windstorm, hurricane, or flood due to proximity to water, elevation, construction type, or lack of exterior protection,\u201d the notice read.\n\nMany insurance companies have started to amend policies to include high mandatory wind deductibles. A 2021 report from the state Division of Insurance noted that wind deductibles had started creeping up in coastal areas, including the Vineyard, Cape Cod, Nantucket and the South Coast.\n\nAll but six of the top 25 insurance companies in the Massachusetts market had mandatory wind deductibles, and the largest deductibles were for coastal communities, according to the report. Some customers were seeing deductibles as high as 5 per cent.\n\nLater reports for 2022 were not on the division\u2019s website and the state agency did not respond to a request for comment this week.\n\nWith wind deductibles so high, most wind damage from storms likely won\u2019t get covered at all anymore, Mr. Gervais said. As an example, a $1 million property with a modest wind damage deductible of 2 per cent would need to reach a damage threshold of $20,000 before the insurer stepped in to help.\n\n\u201cIn most cases if there is a big storm, the insurance policy will not cover that damage because it\u2019s less than $20,000,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. O\u2019Connor expects wind coverage to be rolled back in the coming years, as it has done for some commercial properties.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s where the homeowner market is trending,\u201d she said.\n\nIn some instances, people with higher risk properties can fall back on the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association. The state-legislated association, commonly referred to as the FAIR Plan, writes policies for eligible applicants who cannot find other insurance.\n\nHowever, the association only provides coverage for properties up to $1 million. Island agents said that leaves the Vineyard vulnerable because of the Island\u2019s dizzying valuations and the cost of construction. The median home price in 2022 was $1.4 million.\n\n\u201cIf they would increase their cap it would help out a lot,\u201d said Ms. O\u2019Connor. \u201cRight now, it doesn\u2019t do people a lot of good.\u201d\n\nMr. Soo Hoo said that insurance often runs in cycles, with tough markets coming every six to 10 years. The current market, however, is one of the toughest.\n\nOne longtime insurance agent in his office has been helping homeowners for 30 years.\n\n\u201cShe said it\u2019s the worst she\u2019s ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have to agree. If you look around nationally, it\u2019s never been so bad.\u201d"

        "title": "3 Questions: A bigger, better space-ripple detector - MIT News",
        "content": "The search for space-shaking ripples in the universe just got a big boost. An MIT-led effort to build a bigger, better gravitational-wave detector will receive $9 million dollars over the next three years from the National Science Foundation. The funding infusion will support the design phase for Cosmic Explorer \u2014 a next-generation gravitational-wave observatory that is expected to pick up ripples in space-time from as far back as the early universe. To do so, the observatory\u2019s detectors are planned to span the length of a small city.\n\nThe observatory\u2019s conceptual design takes after the detectors of LIGO \u2014 the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory that is operated by MIT and Caltech. LIGO \u201clistens\u201d for gravitational waves by measuring the timing of two lasers that travel from the same point, down two separate tunnels, and back again. Any difference in their arrival times can be a signal that a gravitational wave passed through the L-shaped detector. LIGO includes two twin detectors, sited in different locations in the United States. A similar set of detectors, Virgo, operates in Italy, along with a third, KAGRA, in Japan.\n\nTogether, this existing network of detectors picks up ripples from gravitational-wave sources, such as merging black holes and neutron stars, every few days. Cosmic Explorer, scientists believe, should bump that rate up to a signal every few minutes. The science coming out of these detections could provide answers to some of the biggest questions in cosmology.\n\nMIT News checked in with Cosmic Explorer\u2019s executive director, Matthew Evans, who is a professor of physics at MIT, and co-principal investigator Salvatore Vitale, associate professor of physics at MIT, about what they hope to hear from the earliest universe.\n\nQ: Walk us through the general idea for Cosmic Explorer \u2014 what will make it a \u201cnext-generation\u201d detector of gravitational waves?\n\nEvans: Cosmic Explorer is in some sense a giant LIGO. The LIGO detectors are four kilometers long for each arm, and Cosmic Explorer will be 40 kilometers on a side, so 10 times larger. And the signal that we get from a gravitational wave is essentially proportional to the size of our detector, and that\u2019s why these things are so big.\n\nBigger is better, up to a point. At some point, you\u2019ve matched the length of the detector to the wavelength of the incoming gravitational waves. And then, if you continue making it bigger, there\u2019s really diminishing returns in terms of scientific output. It\u2019s also hard to find sites to build that large of a detector. When you get too big, the curvature of the Earth starts to become an issue because the detector\u2019s laser beam has to travel in a straight line, and that\u2019s less possible when a detector is so large that it has to curve with the Earth.\n\nIn terms of looking for possible sites, fortunately now, as opposed to in the 1980s when sites were being looked at for LIGO, there\u2019s a lot of public data that\u2019s available digitally. So we have already first versions of algorithmic searches that can search the U.S. for potential candidate sites. We\u2019re looking for places which are kind of flat but also a little bowl-shaped in terms of altitude because that would avoid some excavation. And we\u2019re looking for places that are not in the middle of cities or lakes, or in the mountains, and that aren\u2019t too far from populated regions so that we could imagine getting scientists in and out. Our first go-around shows there are some potential candidates, especially in the western half of the U.S.\n\nWe see Cosmic Explorer as \u201cnext-generation\u201d in the sense that it will replace existing observatories. If we were to build two Cosmic Explorer observatories in the U.S., which is our reference concept, then we would presumably shut down the two LIGO observatories. That\u2019s probably mid-2030s, depending on how funding goes. So, it\u2019s still a ways in the future. But we believe it would change the name of the game in terms of the science we can do.\n\nQ: And what might that science be? What new things could you see, and what big questions could it answer?\n\nVitale: It will allow us to see sources that are farther away. And by sources, I mean things that we are seeing today, such as black holes and neutron stars colliding. Now, with the sensitivity of LIGO, we can see sources in our backyard, cosmologically speaking \u2014 about one-and-a-half billion years ago. That seems far away, but compared to the size of the universe, which is about 13 to 14 billion years old, that\u2019s pretty nearby. That means we are missing important steps of the history of the universe, one of which is \u201cCosmic Noon,\u201d where most of the stars in the universe were formed. That\u2019s when the universe was around 3 billion years old. It would be great to access sources which were formed around that time, because it would teach us a lot about how black holes and neutron stars come from stars.\n\nGoing beyond that, when the universe was about a billion years old, during the Epoch of Reionization \u2014 that\u2019s when atoms were ionized and galaxies started to form \u2014 this is still too far for us to see. Cosmic Explorer would be sensitive to the mergers of black holes and neutron stars up to those distances, and even farther than that.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be able to see sources in a much clearer and louder way. Today, LIGO might detect something with a signal-to-noise ratio of 30, where it\u2019s pretty loud but hard to characterize. That same signal, coming through Cosmic Explorer, would have a signal-to-noise of 3,000. So, anything that requires really sensitive measurements, like testing if Einstein\u2019s relativity is correct, which now we can do but with large uncertainties \u2014 that would be a more precise test with Cosmic Explorer.\n\nFinally, many measurements get better the more sources you have. We think Cosmic Explorer could detect hundreds of thousands of black hole binaries and up to a million neutron star mergers per year.\n\nEvans: Being able to detect more sources lets you detect objects that are in the corners of parameter space, which you wouldn\u2019t otherwise detect \u2014 like very large spins of the black hole, or very high mass ratios. If you have hundreds of thousands of sources, you can detect these oddballs.\n\nQ: What\u2019s next for the project going forward?\n\nEvans: Over the next three years, we\u2019ll be doing a full, top-down design, where we pick all the parameters of the instrument and include the infrastructure that goes around it, like the vacuum system, and we end up doing architectural designs for the buildings. And all of this needs to lead to a cost estimate which is fairly sound, both for the construction and the preliminary design. By the end of the next design phase we will have to have identified sites and have solid architectural and infrastructural designs done, and the design of the instrument will be at the nuts-and-bolts level.\n\nThe environment in which we\u2019re doing this is one that includes other next-gen detectors in development, such as the space mission, LISA, being run by the European Space Agency, and expected to launch mid-2030s. There is also the Einstein Telescope in Europe. All these groups are colleagues rather than competitors, who we anticipate working with. In this field, you get farther by working together. It's kind of a global effort to build these next-generation gravitational wave detectors, and it\u2019s global science."
