        "content": "Michael S. Barr, the ex-Ripple advisor and current Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision, met with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde in Frankfurt on Wednesday, according to a recent tweet from the latter. This meeting has resulted in some buzz within the XRP community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLagarde, a long-time financial industry influencer, is known for her nuanced stance on cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile she has been critical of Bitcoin and other private cryptocurrencies, expressing concerns about their environmental impact, potential misuse for money laundering, and the risks to uninformed investors, she has simultaneously advocated for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\nThe meeting with Barr, who served as an advisor for Ripple Labs, a significant player in the digital currency space, is likely to spur speculation about the ECB's future stance on digital currencies.\n\nBarr, who served as an advisor for Ripple Labs from mid-2015, and took office as the Vice Chair for Supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 2022, has a profound understanding of financial regulations and international finance.\n\nThe details and outcomes of the meeting have not been disclosed, but the crypto community will be watching closely. The implications of this meeting could range from further development and possible acceleration of the ECB's exploration of CBDCs to a more nuanced approach to the regulation of private cryptocurrencies"

These are real people who are never going to see their loved ones again,\" Dupre said.\n\nJacob Blanchard lost his 20-year-old daughter Jillian Blanchard in June of 2020 after she was hit head on by drunk driver Jerrod Lee Watkins.\n\n\"There's no doubt at the level of impairment that he was, he would have definitely hit someone else. My daughter was someone else's angel that day,\" Blanchard said.\n\nBlanchard says the ripple effects last forever.\n\n\"She'll never be able to have kids, she'll never get married. I'll never be a grandparent because of it, so that ripple effect hurts,\" Blanchard said.\n\nCurrently 26% of all traffic deaths on the Texas roadways are caused by drunk drivers.\n\nThis is about three people dying every day, according to TxDOT.\n\nBlanchard became a member of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, where he shares his stories with DWI offenders.\n\n\"The person you kill may be someone that you love. Okay? So, you don't always kill a stranger. So, when you get behind the wheel as a drunk driver you could literally kill your own brother and sister or your own parents and if you think of it that way you'll never do the act,\" Blanchard said.\n\nNovember 7, 2000 was the last day a person was not killed on Texas roadways by an impaired driver.\n\nTxDOT reminds everyone to always choose a sober ride and that there are various rideshare apps available for use."

        "content": "The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has approved Ripple\u2019s application for a Major Payment Institution (MPI) License in principle.\n\nCommenting, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said Singapore is \u201ctaking a pragmatic, innovation-first approach to crypto.\u201d Also, Garlinghouse said he is proud that Ripple is one of only a few companies to have been granted an MPI License.\n\nRipple stated that its Asia-Pacific cross-border payment solutions, servicing businesses and financial institutions, had experienced massive growth in 2022. This expanded its Singapore base, doubling the staff to cope with demand.\n\nFurthermore, the company commended the central bank\u2019s innovative approach to fintech regulation, adding that the region is set to \u201creap the myriad benefits\u201d of supporting digital asset technology while spearheading future global regulation. The statement signed off:\n\n\u201cThis in-principle approval marks an important inflection point in the country\u2019s positive and progressive adoption of digital assets, and Ripple looks forward to continued growth and expansion in Singapore and throughout the APAC region.\u201d\n\nThe MAS operates three types of payment service provider licenses \u2013 Standard Payment Institution, Major Payment Institution, and Money-Changing.\n\nThe MPI License allows the holder to conduct business without being subject to thresholds on daily/monthly limits. The eligibility criteria include having a Singaporean-registered company or branch, a permanent place of business storing records, a minimum capital base of $250,000, and at least one director with Singapore residency or citizenship.\n\nMAS also stated that the applicant\u2019s track record, financial condition, and whether the company and related entities are already subject to \u201cproper supervision by a competent regulatory authority\u201d may also be considered.\n\nThe license approval comes when the ongoing U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) vs. Ripple lawsuit is close to final judgment.\n\nThe SEC sued Ripple in December 2020 over allegations of offering and raising $1.3 billion of unregistered securities through the XRP token.\n\nXRP recorded a 5.7% swing on the June 22 daily candle to peak at $0.5272 \u2013 marking a seven-day high.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "XRP Moon Time? Ripple Eyes Upper Hand In SEC Lawsuit As CEO Garlinghouse Sheds Light On Case Outcome - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, made key revelations regarding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a rare video address, providing light on what he believes to be a purposeful effort to stifle innovation in the crypto space and control through enforcement. The documents associated with the notorious 2018 Hinman speech, which covered the standards for establishing if a token is a security, were recently unsealed, prompting the Chief Executive to make his remarks.\n\nHighlighting the contents of the unsealed documents, Garlinghouse stated, \u201cAt best, these documents show that senior officials at the SEC couldn\u2019t agree on the law and told Bill Hinman directly he would confuse the public even more about the rules for crypto. At worst, they show that Hinman deliberately ignored the law and tried to create new laws, something only Congress can do.\u201d\n\nGarlinghouse further emphasized that while the SEC put on a front of openness and direction, the findings were not limited to any token or blockchain and instead served as proof of the agency\u2019s tenacious pursuit of enforcement actions against the sector. He mentioned Ripple\u2019s aggressive interaction with the SEC, including private meetings with Jay Clayton and Bill Hinman, during which no objections to the token XRP being categorized as a security were voiced.\n\n\u201cWe were fully transparent, not knowing they would then use this information against us,\u201d Ripple\u2019s CEO said in the Video message. He criticized the unexpected SEC Wells notification, citing violations of the Securities and Exchange Act without offering details and reiterating the experiences of others who had faced similar legal procedures.\n\nGarlinghouse alleged that the SEC tried discouraging American crypto innovation by pointing out the regulatory body\u2019s purported contradictions and ambiguities. He called out the current SEC chair as an unelected bureaucrat. He accused the SEC of utilizing the lack of regulatory clarity to seize control of the whole cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe SEC tried to bully us into acquiescing,\u201d Garlinghouse stated. \u201cThankfully we have had the resources to fight back, and now we can all see what they\u2019ve fought so hard to hide. They knowingly created confusion about the rules and used that confusion to regulate through enforcement. That\u2019s bad faith, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nThe Ripple CEO noted that there is still much to be done in the struggle for regulatory clarity as the SEC\u2019s action against Ripple approaches its conclusion. He expressed his gratitude to those who supported Ripple throughout the process, including his co-workers, friends, family, and the larger XRP community.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approach to cryptocurrency has been the subject of increased debate since Garlinghouse\u2019s discoveries, which have also called into question the agency\u2019s transparency and regulatory aims. The need for transparent legislation and an environment that fosters innovation is still at the forefront of the continuing discussion as the crypto community waits for new developments."
