        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry secured an early victory in its court battle with U.S. regulators when a federal judge ruled on Thursday that the sale on public exchanges of a digital asset called XRP complied with securities laws.\n\nFor years, the Securities and Exchange Commission has argued that digital assets constitute securities, like stocks and bonds traded on Wall Street, and should be subject to the same strict regulations. Last month, the S.E.C. sued two of the largest crypto exchanges, Coinbase and Binance, accusing them of marketing unregistered securities to the public.\n\nBut the ruling on Thursday in a case involving the crypto company Ripple may complicate that argument and provide fodder for the crypto industry to defend itself in court.\n\nThe S.E.C. sued Ripple in December 2020, accusing the firm of violating securities laws in one of the first major legal fights involving cryptocurrencies. In the 34-page ruling on Thursday, Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said that Ripple did not break the law when the cryptocurrency it created, XRP, was sold on public exchanges."

S3studio | Getty Images\n\nRipple's XRP token surged on Thursday after a judge in the Southern District of New York ruled that it's \"not necessarily a security on its face.\" The price of XRP was last higher by 71% at about 80 cents a coin, according to Coin Metrics. The news gave hope to crypto investors, who breathed a sigh of relief that other altcoins also may not be considered securities after all. Polygon's matic token gained 17.82%. Litecoin and the Solana jumped 18.35%, and Cardano's token advanced 20.31%. Bitcoin and ether got a boost too, rising more than 4% and 6%, respectively. \"The judgments today are a huge step forward for the industry,\" Chris Martin, head of research at Amberdata, told CNBC. \"By judging that XRP is not a security we're starting to get clarity on what constitutes a security and what constitutes a commodity \u2014 the SEC will have to revise their tactics on several of their ongoing cases and I expect that this judgment will implicate several other tokens as non-securities.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nCoinbase, which had previously de-listed XRP on its trading platform, tweeted on Thursday afternoon that it would now allow trading of the asset again. Gemini said it's \"exploring the listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading.\" \"The judgment that institutional sales of XRP by Ripple constitute securities also has massive implications for the industry with several ICO's now likely in the spotlight,\" Martin added. \"For exchanges caught in ongoing SEC cases, it's not clear how this judgment will affect them \u2013 they've only been involved in secondary sales for the most part. But as we can see with prices today, the market is very bullish on the judgments.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon XRP surges after judge rules it's not a security"
