        "content": "More than 16 million people in the Middle East are currently displaced, and water insecurity is likely to drive further displacement. Climate change and ineffective water management have driven people from their homes as floods, droughts, and landslides have become more common. Water insecurity also drives instability and conflict, as resource shortages aggravate pre-existing vulnerabilities and inequalities.\n\nPlease join the CSIS Middle East Program for a virtual discussion on the connections between water insecurity and displacement and how these factors have played out in Iraq, Yemen, and Syria with eminent experts Giorgi Gigauri, Niku Jafarnia, and Michael Talhami, moderated by Natasha Hall.\n\nThis event is made possible through support by Bahaa Rafic Hariri."

July could prove to be a crucial month for the crypto market, with many major developments expected by investors.\n\nThe US House Financial Service Committee prepares to bring regulatory clarity and a stablecoin bill. This could also see US SEC and CFTC having separate control of the crypto market. Moreover, Judges in different cases including Binance, Coinbase, Terraform Labs, and others will announce major decisions in July.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRipple continues its global outreach despite the SEC lawsuit. Last week, Ripple Markets APAC Pte Ltd received in-principle approval of the Major Payments Institution license from Singapore\u2019s central bank Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n\nIn addition, institutional investors are again buying XRP as ETFs recorded the first week of inflow after many weeks of outflows. The renewed interest amid Bitcoin ETF filing and TradFi entering crypto industry have led to an increase in sentiment among traders.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Withdraws License From Another European Country, Focus In UAE\n\nRipple vs SEC: XRP Price to Jump Again in July?\n\nPopular crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to Twitter on June 26 to share interesting data on the relationship between network activity and XRP price.\n\nAccording to Santiment data, XRP price jumped higher following a spike in the number of active XRP addresses in the last three instances this year. Prices soared 25% in January, 50% in March, and 25% in May after daily active addresses increased significantly.\n\n\u201cThe last three instances XRP price jumped were preceded by a spike in the number of active XRP addresses.\u201d\n\nSantiment on-chain data shows a surge in XRP daily active addresses in the last few days. It indicates a high probability of a jump in XRP price. As per historical data and US SEC v. Ripple lawsuit sentiment, a 50% is expected again.\n\nXRP price has rallied more than 35% this year. The price is currently trading at $0.48, down 2% in 24hrs.

        "content": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2013 We are digging deeper into the disparities the Black community faces when it comes to swimming in Northeast Florida.\n\nIt was a skill that was largely denied to Black Americans, especially in the Segregated South. There was a time when there was no pool for Black people to use in Jacksonville.\n\nIt gives more insight into how Jacksonville\u2019s past creates a ripple effect with drowning rates today.\n\nRELATED: How the impact of the historic St. Augustine \u2018Swim-In\u2019 still echoes today | Mother of reporter who drowned on the job in 1998 also didn\u2019t know how to swim\n\n87-year-old Warner Singleton learned to swim in metal water tanks on philanthropist Eartha White\u2019s property on Moncrief Road in the late 1940s.\n\n\u201cThey had a big tank \u2014 like those above-the-ground pools are now. It was just one level, one depth,\u201d Singleton said.\n\nThe metal tanks, which historians said were also used for baptisms, were some of the few options for Black Americans in Jacksonville during segregation.\n\nRELATED: 50 years later: Monson Motor Lodge incident | Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. joined push to end racial discrimination in nation\u2019s oldest city\n\nAnother place where black children could swim was part of a city trash site called \u2018Brown\u2019s Dump.\u2019\n\nIt was a reservoir full of chemicals on Pearce Street near the former Mary Mcleod Bethune elementary school.\n\n84-year-old Pearl White remembers children getting in that water.\n\n\u201cAll of it was polluted,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kids didn\u2019t really know anything about polluted water or what it could do to your skin, even if you swallowed some or inhaled some could do to your lungs or any of your bodily organs. Some of them did, they were just trying to cool off.\u201d\n\nThe city pool in the Springfield neighborhood, which first opened in 1922 was whites-only.\n\n\u201cWe never went. We were afraid. We didn\u2019t in Springfield Park period. Day or night,\u201d she said.\n\nRELATED: \u2018He will be missed\u2019: Local Civil Rights activist Ben Frazier dies at 73 | Activist Mimi Jones, captured in famous civil rights image, dies at 73\n\nWhite said the racial tensions were palpable.\n\n\u201cIn the back of your mind, you always got that little feeling that something might happen to me over here if I\u2019m over here. I don\u2019t know so I\u2019m not going,\u201d White said.\n\nClemson University professor and Jacksonville native Abel Bartley wrote a book on the city\u2019s past and said local leaders drew a hard line in the sand when it came to water.\n\n\u201cWhat you have is a long history of African Americans being denied access to things that are important. Water was one of the defining lines,\u201d Bartley said.\n\nEfforts to change that started in 1948, when councilman Claude Smith promised black community leaders the city would build them a pool, if they voted for him instead of the black candidate.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that they had argued for since the 1940s, was that they wanted a swimming pool, a place for their kids to go during the summer months,\u201d he said.\n\nSmith won the election and the pool on Jefferson Street was built shortly after in 1951.\n\n\u201cOn the first day, it was loaded,\u201d Singleton said.\n\n\u201cThis was an outlet for us. It was safe for you to be,\u201d White said.\n\nSingleton and White climbed the ranks, getting certification after certification right here at the pool.\n\n\u201cAll we thought about was training other people to become swimmers,\u201d Singleton said.\n\nSaving lives and teaching swim lessons along the way.\n\n\u201cEvery time you turn around somebody was in there struggling. From the beginning. After a while, it became less and less and less, because more being were learning how to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite said the Jefferson Street pool helped contribute to more Black people learning how to swim.\n\n\u201cWe had swim lessons every morning from 10 to 12. This place would be packed,\u201d she said.\n\nSingleton eventually made history as one of Jacksonville\u2019s first Black lifeguards.\n\nHe said the Jefferson Street pool did more than just create swimmers.\n\n\u201cIt was very, very, I guess you could say enlightening. Making us want to be people. We wanted to be more than what we were here,\u201d he said.\n\nHe eventually became co-captain of the Jefferson Street Swim Club, the city\u2019s first Black swim team.\n\nWhite was on the first women\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any other Black teams for us to participate against anyway, so we had to compete with each other. And it was just fun,\u201d she said.\n\nA key figure in training Singleton and the team was Jacksonville\u2019s first Black aquatics director Julius Guinyard, a man who spent countless hours mentoring neighborhood kids at the pool, which also doubled as a recreation center.\n\n\u201cWithout Julius Guinyard, a lot of people would not be who they are,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he was. He was a big father-type figure to these people out here.\u201d\n\nThe pool is now named after him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor for this pool to be named after him,\u201d Singleton said.\n\nDespite the progress made by having the Jefferson Street pool in the neighborhood, Bartley says the stain of segregation surrounding swimming pools, continues to create a ripple effect in the Black community.\n\nMost Black people still don\u2019t know their way around the water.\n\n\u201cBeing able to swim versus not being able to swim, that was what put one group in a superior position and another group in an inferior position. There\u2019s never been an incentive to make up for the ground that was lost,\u201d Bartley said.\n\nSingleton is hopeful, especially seeing that the Jefferson Street pool is still here, after all these years.\n\n\u201cIt just feels good to be here to see that thing has still survived,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I walked in, I just felt a warm feeling, that, hey, I was a part of this whole mechanism that went here, from the beginning.\u201d\n\nSingleton and White still swim in their 80s and have taught hundreds how to swim here in the community."

        "title": "Here's why Ripple XRP partnerships and MoUs often go nowhere - Protos",
        "content": "Over the years, Ripple has announced innumerable XRP partnerships that it ultimately abandoned. Thousands of crypto leaders publish official-looking press releases about preliminary initiatives that generate minimal results. Their primary intention is usually to associate the token with the large brand partner and its \u201cutility.\u201d\n\nOccasionally, those large brands are not even aware that the partnership exists. Helium (HNT), for example, once promised token holders that it had partnerships with Salesforce and Lime scooters that never existed.\n\nAccording to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple\u2019s partnership announcements were not merely innocent attempts at brand-building \u2014 to the contrary, Ripple made over $2 billion off XRP sales in large part as it \u201cmade an avalanche of public statements\u201d attempting to increase the value of XRP.\n\nAccording to commissioners, Ripple misused XRP partnerships to sway investors into believing they were making an investment in XRP that might increase in value from the efforts of Ripple.\n\nThese included several memorandums of understanding (MoUs); non-binding documents indicating a tentative plan to work together. Often, nothing actually happens after parties sign an MoU. Binance, for example, once had a nonbinding agreement to buy FTX in November 2022. Days later, it abandoned that MoU; FTX went bankrupt.\n\nHere are some examples among hundreds of Ripple (XRP) \u2018partnerships\u2019 that have generated minimal usage of XRP.\n\nEarly years\n\nOn January 29, 2016, Japan-based SBI announced an MoU to work together to develop Ripple Connect. Since then, SBI has published glowing series of press releases naming its various subsidiaries of gaming, banking, and fintech companies \u2014 which number in the hundreds. SBI, of course, received equity and XRP from Ripple prior to all of these announcements. None of these announcements occurred without financial incentivization by Ripple.\n\nOn April 26, 2018, Ripple announced deals with FairFX, RationalFX, Exchange4Free, UniPAY, and MoneyMax to use RippleNet and the xVia API for payment originators. Out of those four organizations, only MoneyMax mentions Ripple in any capacity.\n\nMoneyGram and other 2019 partnerships\n\nMoneyGram began using XRP Ledger technology in June 2019 in what Ripple called a \u201cstrategic partnership.\u201d\n\nIn reality, MoneyGram only used XRP technology because Ripple was subsidizing its otherwise unprofitable use. Specifically, Ripple paid MoneyGram tens of millions of dollars in \u201cmarket development fees\u201d which Moneygram initially booked as revenue and only later reclassified as \u201ccontra expenses.\u201d\n\nMoneyGram eventually ended the deal altogether after Ripple stopped paying and the SEC filed its complaint alleging that Ripple offered unregistered securities to US investors.\n\nRead more: After dumping Ripple, MoneyGram cozies up to Jed McCaleb\u2019s Stellar\n\nIn October 2019, Ripple said it was partnering with Finastra to add blockchain technology to payments. Today, Ripple is not on Finastra\u2019s list of partners.\n\nThat same month, Ripple partner Finablr signed a deal with UnionPay to increase its international operations. This included a plan to enable Chinese customers to send payments through Finablr\u2019s Swytch. However, there are still no options to directly exchange CNY to XRP through UnionPay.\n\nCBDCs and carbon credits\n\nOn May 15, 2021, Ripple tweeted plans to become carbon-neutral by 2030 and announced partnerships with several organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Mercy Corps, Mojaloop Foundation, and the Institute for Business and Social Impact. Of course, 2030 was nine years away when Ripple benefited from that press release in 2021.\n\nIn June 2021, Ripple and the Digital Pound Foundation announced a collaboration on a British CBDC. So far, an official British CBDC has not materialized and is still \u201csome years away,\u201d according to Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe.\n\nBhutan\u2019s central bank similarly announced a deal with Ripple to pilot a CBDC in September 2021. In August 2022 and May 2023, they appeared to announce the same thing, indicating that they may not have made much progress on this. Despite tests and trials for the past few years, no Bhutanese CBDC exists.\n\nIn November 2021, Ripple announced a deal with the Republic of Palau to explore a possible CBDC. The Republic of Palau has not said anything about it or even mentioned plans for a national digital currency on its website. Ripple claims that Palau is still in years-long pilot testing.\n\nIn 2022, Ripple promised $100 million in investments to develop a blockchain-based carbon credit market. So far, it has invested just $15 million in what it calls \u201ccarbon removal advanced market commitments.\u201d\n\nRecent partnerships\n\nRipple announced a partnership with Pyypl in 2021 to develop an international remittance service to the Philippines. By April 2023, Ripple and Pyypl had entirely pivoted to developing a micro-investment platform for African residents.\n\nIn March 2022, Ripple\u2019s Creator Fund announced that it was partnering with NFT marketplace Ethernal Labs. Today, Ethernal Labs\u2019 NFT marketplace, Ethernity, offers Ethereum- and Polygon-based NFTs, but no XRP-based NFTs.\n\nIn June 2022, Ripple announced a deal with luxury product marketplace Lunu to use Ripple\u2019s Liquidity Hub to enable cryptocurrency payments. Lunu has said nothing about it on its blog. Instead, it announced deals with Paxful and Binance to assist with payments and liquidity. It also created its own mobile terminal that enables digital asset payments without using the XRP Ledger.\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s what new Tether documents reveal about its reserves\n\nIn August 2022, Ripple announced a deal with Brazil\u2019s Travelex Bank to use RippleNet for cross-border payments. Like most cross-border remittance partnerships in Ripple\u2019s history, there is no option to convert the Brazilian real to XRP on Travelex, and the partnership appears abandoned.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the hype\n\nLike many non-binding MoUs, Ripple\u2019s tentative partnership announcements often fall through. Many crypto partnerships are mere fodder for bullish token price forecasts.\n\nRather than believing promotional announcements, investors should maintain healthy skepticism. Questioning partnerships until the work is complete and organic, uncompensated utility proves product-market fit is often the safest approach.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.
