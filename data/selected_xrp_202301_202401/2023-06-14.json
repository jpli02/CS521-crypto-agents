        "content": "Ripple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called \u201cRipple\u201d even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders \u201cgifted\u201d 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as \u201cRipple.\u201d"

        "title": "Ripple to Expand into Europe on Back of MiCA Amid US Regulatory Uncertainty - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Ripple sustains global expansion despite the pressure from the U.S. SEC lawsuit, with a view to penetrate deeper into Europe as MiCA becomes law.\n\nRipple continues to push for expansion on a global scale despite facing a multi-year legal tussle with the U.S. SEC. The regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. has catalyzed Ripple\u2019s penchant for global expansion, as the technology company seeks to penetrate deeper into Europe on the back of the MiCA regulation.\n\nSendi Young, Ripple\u2019s Managing Director (MD) for the U.K. and Europe, highlighted these expansion initiatives in a recent interview at the Money20/20 event in Europe this month. Antony Welfare, CBDC Advisor at Ripple, called attention to the interview in a tweet today.\n\nGreat interview with @sendiyoung on @Ripple's future prospects here in Europe and #CBDC: \u201cIt's really a number of different currencies and CBDCs. They're all going to be coexisting and that kind of ability to interoperate, to go in and out is going to be very important.\u201d https://t.co/fAzlDmZ7Yn \u2014 Antony Welfare (@AntonyWelfare) June 14, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRipple\u2019s Digital Currencies Plans\n\nWelfare pointed out Young\u2019s remarks pertaining to Ripple\u2019s extended efforts towards digital currency and CBDC developments. According to Young, Ripple has continued to expand its offerings to accommodate digital assets and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).\n\nRecall that, as The Crypto Basic disclosed last month, Ripple rolled out its CBDC platform for central banks and other financial institutions to develop their own digital currencies on May 18. Ripple is also collaborating with Montenegro for the development of the country\u2019s digital currency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a number of different currencies and CBDCs. They\u2019re all going to be coexisting, and that kind of ability to interoperate, to go in and out, is going to be very important,\u201d Young remarked, speaking on Ripple\u2019s CBDC efforts in the latest Money20/20 interview.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRipple Intensifies Europe Expansion Plans\n\nBesides the CBDC initiatives, Young also emphasized the importance of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in creating a fertile ground for Ripple\u2019s expansion into Europe. Recall that all 27 European Union finance ministers unanimously voted to pass the MiCA regulation last month. The European Parliament president signed the bill into law on May 31.\n\nEven prior to the approval of MiCA, Ripple had been making attempts towards expanding its reach in Europe. The Crypto Basic reported last November that the firm was seeking an operational license in Ireland as part of its efforts to expand into Europe. MiCA has encouraged Ripple to intensify these European expansion plans.\n\nSpeaking on the MiCA regulation and the impact of clear legislation in Europe, Young noted: \u201cI think that\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen much bigger mainstream take up and the real benefits of crypto\u2019s utility being realized. Without clear regulation, that is impossible. I see that as the first step in getting more mainstream adoption.\u201d\n\nThe favorable environment observed in Europe and the U.K. directly contrasts the atmosphere in the U.S. where industry leaders have continued to bemoan the SEC\u2019s aggressive enforcement actions. The agency recently sued Binance and Coinbase for facilitating trades in unregulated securities despite the prevalent regulatory uncertainty in the country."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether extend losses; XRP drops most - Forkast News",
        "content": "Both Bitcoin and Ether fell in Wednesday afternoon trade in Asia, with Ripple\u2019s XRP leading losses among the other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. Other tokens in the top 10 traded mixed, with crypto exchange Binance\u2019s BNB token leading the gains amid its ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors are looking forward to the U.S. central bank\u2019s decision on interest rates to be announced later on Wednesday, with the Federal Reserve expected to keep rates unchanged at 5%-5.25%.\n\nSee related article: How American courts have become central to crypto law\n\nXRP leads losses, BNB gains\n\nBitcoin fell 0.69% to US$25,894 in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost 3.40% in the past week following lawsuits brought by U.S. regulators against two of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second biggest cryptocurrency, fell 0.42% to US$1,741 over the past 24 hours, bringing its weekly losses to 7.18%.\n\n\u201cLast week and the weekend were tumultuous days for cryptocurrency markets, marked by significant declines in valuations across the board,\u201d Robert Quartly-Janeiro, Chief Strategy Officer of crypto exchange Bitrue, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThe challenges faced by Binance and Coinbase in the United States hold significant weight. Binance, commanding over 60% of the global market, and Coinbase, with 70% market share in the USA, are major participants so what happens to them naturally affects global sentiment,\u201d Quartly-Janeiro added.\n\nBNB, the native token of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange Binance, gained 4.93% to US$246 over the past 24 hours. That reduced its weekly losses to 10.95%.\n\nThe gains came after a U.S. federal judge on Tuesday denied the SEC\u2019s request to freeze the assets of Binance.US. The decision allows Binance.US to continue operating while it battles a lawsuit filed against it by the regulator last week. The SEC alleges that Binance.US failed to register as a securities exchange while offering and selling unregistered securities.\n\nThe SEC also sued Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., on similar charges.\n\n\u201cOutflows from Coinbase and Binance reached US$4 billion during the week. Crypto traders, spooked by SEC lawsuits, are withdrawing assets from exchanges en masse,\u201d Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at online brokerage firm FxPro, said in emailed comments.\n\nIn a parallel development involving the SEC and crypto, Ripple\u2019s XRP token was the biggest loser, dropping 5.36% to US$0.5013 in 24 hours and 4.93% on the week. The drop came after the so-called \u201cHinman documents\u201d were released, named after former SEC corporate finance director William Hinman.\n\nRipple Labs Inc. was sued by the SEC in December 2020, for allegedly selling US$1.3 billion in unregistered securities. The company asked to unseal documents in which Hinman said Bitcoin and Ether should not be categorized as financial securities. The comments are a major point of contention in the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple as Ripple seeks to bolster its fair notice defense.\n\nRipple\u2019s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cHinman\u2019s speech should never again be invoked in any serious discussion about whether a token is or is not a security. Unelected bureaucrats must faithfully apply the law within the constraints of their jurisdiction.\u201d\n\n14/ And finally, Hinman\u2019s speech should never again be invoked in any serious discussion about whether a token is or is not a security. Unelected bureaucrats must faithfully apply the law within the constraints of their jurisdiction. They can\u2019t \u2013 as Hinman tried \u2013 create new law. \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 13, 2023\n\nMarkus Thielen, Head of Research & Strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, feels that the crypto crackdown by the U.S. SEC opens up new opportunities for other parts of the world including Asia.\n\n\u201cI think the key difference is that in the U.S., derivatives are not really offered; only the spot market. And the derivatives market is 11 times bigger than the spot market,\u201d Thielen told Bloomberg on June 13.\n\n\u201cSo a lot of the trading already happens outside of the U.S. and I think this is why Binance got into trouble because a lot of U.S. institutions appear to be trading on the platform according to the allegations. I think to really offset the pressure from the U.S., I think Hong Kong needs to do more and I think Hong Kong can actually step into this void now,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nEven in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which gained momentum after multiple centralized finance (CeFi) collapses throughout 2022, institutional investors are looking at Asia and the Middle East.\n\n\u201cGrowth is returning to DeFi, albeit slower than last year, but interest is coming back as institutions and investors evaluate the landscape,\u201d Robert Alcorn, chief executive and Co-Founder of DeFi credit marketplace Clearpool, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the main obstacle for traditional institutions remains regulatory clarity and compliance. Significant progress has been made in this regard across Asia and the Middle East, which is likely to encourage investor participation, and we expect these regions to become the main crypto lending hubs as confidence builds,\u201d Alcorn added.\n\nIn Asia, Hong Kong\u2019s new rules for the cryptocurrency industry came into effect from June 1, as part of the city\u2019s ambition to become a global hub for digital assets.\n\nThis week, Hong Kong-based Bank of China International Holdings (BOCI) issued US$28 million worth of fully digital structured notes in the form of tokens on Ethereum blockchain. That makes it the first Chinese financial institution to issue a tokenized security in Hong Kong, according to a statement from investment banking firm UBS.\n\nThe product was developed by UBS and is available to its clients in the Asia Pacific region.\n\n\u201cWorking together with UBS, we are driving the simplification of digital asset markets and products for customers in Asia Pacific through the development of blockchain-based digital structured products, designed specifically for customers in Asia Pacific,\u201d Ying Wang, deputy chief executive officer at BOCI, said in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the evolution of Hong Kong\u2019s digital economy and are committed to promoting the digital transformation and innovative development of Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry,\u201d Wang added.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization fell 0.46% to US$1.06 trillion, while total market volume gained 8.59% to US$31.3 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nNFT markets slump, Snoop Dogg releases collectibles\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.63% to 2,942.34 in the 24 hours to 6.45 p.m. in Hong Kong, registering losses of 10.43% over the last seven days.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite dropped 1.24% to 1,037.33, down 6.37% on the week.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is finally reacting to the U.S. SEC\u2019s stepped-up attacks against the cryptocurrency industry,\u201d according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cEither way, it\u2019s pretty clear we\u2019re entering another new phase of the NFT market, and traders are being cautious. How low we can go, nobody knows,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume on the Ethereum blockchain dropped 3.07% to US$13.09 million in 24 hours. In stark contrast, sales volume gained 95.59% to US$5.41 million on the Bitcoin network, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nSales of uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 Bitcoin NFTs that are not part of an established collection \u2013 recorded the highest sales volume in 24 hours, climbing 87.32% to US$3.10 million.\n\nAmong other developments in the sector, entertainment icon Snoop Dogg has launched The Snoop Dogg Passport Series, a digital tour collectible. The passport series includes behind-the-scenes video and images uploaded by the rapper, a public relations spokesperson for the project said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe collection will also include visual works from NFT artists like Coldie, Terrell Jones, and Alien Queen.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. futures mixed; European bourses rise\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equities traded mixed on Wednesday as China is expected to cut its headline policy interest rate on Thursday, due to slower-than-expected economic recovery. Senior Chinese officials are reportedly seeking inputs from economists and business leaders on how to revive the world\u2019s second largest economy after three years of Covid-19 related disruptions.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite dropped 0.14% while the Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.26%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index lost 0.58% but Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened 1.47%.\n\nU.S. stock futures were mixed as of 8 p.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 0.26%, and S&P 500 futures gained 0.11%. Nasdaq 100 Futures also rose 0.14%.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at its meeting on June 13 and 14. Current interest rates in the U.S. are between 5% and 5.25%, the highest level since 2006, after 10 consecutive raises that started in March last year.\n\n\u201cThe market has all but moved on to what happens in the [Fed\u2019s] following meeting in July,\u201d DBS Bank said in a research note on June 12.\n\n\u201cGiven the economy\u2019s slow but steady state of affairs, the chance of a hike in that meeting is non-trivial, in our view. In our forecasting horizon, we see both headline and core inflation in the 3-4% range this year and next, which may justify a prolonged pause than a number of additional hikes by the Fed,\u201d DBS said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, a key inflation indicator, showed that inflation in the world\u2019s biggest economy grew at a 4% annual rate in May, compared to 4.9% in April. The CPI was the lowest yearly inflation rate since March 2021, but is still higher than Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\nEuropean bourses strengthened on Wednesday, as investors look forward to the European Central Bank\u2019s decision on interest rates on Thursday. The central bank is expected to announce another 25 basis point rate hike to 3.5%.\n\nThe benchmark STOXX 600 rose 0.57% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 gained 0.52% during afternoon trading hours in Europe."
