        "content": "Time spent in New York City rental apartments feels like dog years. On paper, I\u2019ve lived in the same West Village apartment for almost six years, but it\u2019s really felt more like 40, and over those past 40 years I\u2019ve acquired a lot of stuff. At best, I\u2019m a collector. At worst, I\u2019m a hoarder. I have so many throw pillows that, some days, I can barely find a place to sit on my couch. I\u2019m probably the only person under the age of 65 who has more than five regular print-magazine subscriptions. Drawers almost overflow with random papers. Things can quickly appear disorganized, so if you\u2019ve lived in an apartment as long as I have, you simply need a tray from Kate Rheinstein Brodsky\u2019s Upper East Side shop to get things in order. They\u2019re finished in a high-gloss lacquer, and the design is inspired by Villa Bologna, in Malta. They\u2019ll fool any and all visitors into thinking you have it all under control.

        "content": "In what could be a preparatory move before filing for the spot XRP ETF filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple is hiring for a senior manager role in the institutional Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space. Is this the beginning of a wider institutional adoption of the cryptocurrencies in the financial world?\n\nAlso Read: Altlayer (ALT) Price Jumps 30% After Airdrop And Binance Listing\n\nadvertisement\n\nRipple Already Holds Advantage For XRP ETF Approval?\n\nThe company has already secured a court win in July 2023, with U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan ruling partially in its favor when it comes to the regulatory compliance of securities laws for the sale of XRP tokens to retail investors. The judgment pertaining to the institutional sale of tokens is still pending before the court. In yet another victory for the company, the US SEC had withdrawn the charges it made against company\u2019s executives including chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nWith this judgment, the SEC already faces a legal precedent that shows XRP sales do not amount to investment contracts, paving way for approval of the spot ETF approval. In a recent development, the SEC asked the court to make Ripple provide certain information, like audited financial statements for 2022-2023, contracts for selling or transferring XRP to non-employee parties, and details on XRP sales money received after the lawsuit was filed in December 2020. In a response filed on January 19, Ripple disagreed with the SEC\u2019s request for the documents.\n\nRipple Preparing For ETF Filing?\n\nThe company is hiring for the Senior Manager, Business Development (Institutional DeFi) role, which is to be based in London. It stated that the managerial role is part of the \u2018Ripple X\u2019 team, which is actively partnering with enterprises and institutions to develop solutions and use cases, leveraging on the XRPL Ledger and its native digital asset, XRP. Among the key responsibilities of the role would be to drive cryptocurrencies related ETFs initiatives with internal trading teams and relevant partners.\n\nAlso Read: Terra Luna Classic Core Security Upgrade Proposal Hits Roadblock"

        "content": "The potential launch of automated market making functionality on top of XRP Ledger might change the way Ripple's on-demand liquidity corridors work, a seasoned community enthusiast says. At the same time, other voices in the XRP army raise concerns about this integration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRipple's ODL might reward XRPL AMM liquidity providers: Community\n\nOnce the XRP Ledger AMM amendment is activated, its liquidity providers will be able to benefit from the activity of the Ripple Payments (previously known as On-Demand Liquidity or ODL) service. This statement was shared by Ripple's pseudonymous enthusiast who goes by @WKahneman on X.\n\nThe great thing about the AMM amendment is that by participating in liquidity pools, participants are ostensibly profiting off of ODL. \u2014 WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) January 26, 2024\n\nHe explained that while Ripple Payments and XRPL AMM will be separate independent mechanisms, they might cooperate for mutual benefit. Ripple Payments might source liquidity from AMM, and anyone will be able to participate in on-chain market making with an asset utilized in this or that \"corridor.\"\n\nHowever, to make this dual-system mechanism work, the XRPL/Ripple ecosystem will need an interface for liquidity providers, the influencer admitted.\n\nThe team of XRPL-focused analytical platform XPMarkets opined that this hypothetical tool will only work with a large volume of liquidity injected from the very beginning. Otherwise, the price slippage will be too high and the usage of XRPL AMM by Ripple Payments will make no sense:\n\nIn order for such thing to function, a really high TVL is required. We are talking tens of millions of liquidity in a single pool. Anything less will result in significant price impact and inefficiency for large capital.\n\nRipple's ODL was the most popular product of Ripple in terms of retail cross-border payment. It was rebranded to Ripple Payments in mid-September 2023, as U.Today reported.\n\nXRPL AMM needs five votes to pass\n\nAlso, Jon Nilsen, the owner of an XRP Ledger validator, stressed that injecting liquidity in XRPL AMM is too risky, in particular during the first phases of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the exact timeline for the XRPL AMM activation remains unclear. As of printing time, it only scored 23 votes in favor out of the 28 votes it needs to pass.\n\nUnlike Ethereum (ETH), in the XRP Ledger ecosystem, amendments have no voting deadline. However, the XRPL AMM proposal discussion has already scored the status of the longest in the last years."

        "title": "An alleged N.Y. hate crime tied to Israel-Gaza war raises questions of justice - The Washington Post",
        "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 There was a woman walking toward him, but he didn\u2019t recognize her. They were at a basketball court on a Tuesday morning in Brooklyn, just after 10 a.m. \u2014 two strangers at a playground. The sun was out. It was warm. Ashish Prashar, 40, had taken off his jacket and laid it on the ground. He watched his son, who was 18 months old, standing near the three-point line, happy, babbling, fascinated by an older boy playing basketball. Maybe the boy was this woman\u2019s son, Ash thought, and now she was coming closer, and she began to speak.\n\nThe tone of her voice surprised him. It was firm and direct.\n\nTwo weeks from now, in a courtroom, a prosecutor would summarize what Ash said he heard:\n\n\u201cYou support Hamas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey kill babies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour baby should die.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a terrorist.\u201d\n\nThat morning, it was one month into the Israel-Gaza war, and as the woman came closer, Ash asked himself what was happening. He scanned the playground, and now the facts of the situation came to order in his mind: Around his neck, he was wearing a kaffiyeh, a Palestinian scarf. He and his son had brown skin. They were not Palestinian \u2014 Ash was Punjabi, born in London \u2014 but they might look Palestinian to the woman, whose voice was getting louder now. Ash took a few steps back. He grabbed his son. He grabbed his phone inside his jacket pocket. And then he made a decision that would cascade outward in the weeks ahead, testing what he thought he believed about accountability and compassion.\n\nAt 10:19 a.m., he pressed the record button.\n\n\u201cGo away,\u201d the woman said.\n\nThe phone shook, pointed at the ground, a blacktop covered in dry leaves. The camera leveled. Her figure came into focus on the screen: a woman in a hat and sunglasses, phone in one hand, paper coffee cup in the other.\n\n\u201cYou and your son, go away,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Ash asked.\n\nShe walked toward him, nearly in front of him now.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d she said at a high pitch. \u201cYou cannot take \u2014\u201d\n\nShe raised her hand and hurled her cellphone toward him.\n\n\u201c\u2014 any pictures!\u201d\n\nHer phone crashed, landing in the leaves.\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Ash said.\n\nShe raised her hand again and this time hurled the coffee cup. The cup flew past him, but the lid came off. He felt the liquid hit his neck. It felt hot.\n\n\u201cGet away!\u201d she said.\n\nShe was close to his face now. The camera shook.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t f---ing touch me, love!\u201d Ash said.\n\n\u201cGet away!\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cWhy am I getting away?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you to leave,\u201d she yelled. \u201cI told you to leave.\u201d\n\nShe picked up her phone from the ground.\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cGet the f--- out,\u201d the woman said. \u201cGet the f--- out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna do that.\u201d\n\nShe walked back to Ash again and lunged, swiping at his phone.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t come near me, love,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take pictures of me,\u201d she said.\n\nThe woman swiped at him a second time. Then a third.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a baby,\u201d Ash said.\n\n\u201cGet away,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a baby!\u201d he said.\n\nThe woman turned and started to leave. The playground was quiet.\n\nWhat is happening, Ash kept thinking, until whatever just happened was over.\n\nHe stopped recording, held his son and wondered what he was supposed to do next.\n\n(Ashish Prashar)\n\nForty-seven seconds \u2014 that\u2019s how long the video lasted. And that might have been the end of it. But in a time of rising hate crimes, with anger and outrage available to anyone at any time online, that\u2019s not the way it worked out. Ash went home and showed the video to his wife, Mary Rinaldi. \u201cWe got attacked,\u201d he said. Later that day, he walked to the 88th Precinct in Brooklyn and showed the video to the police, who elevated it to the Hate Crime Task Force in Manhattan. The next day, after Mary said to him, \u201cShe hurt our child and needs to be held accountable,\u201d Ash decided to post the video on Instagram, too.\n\nIn a week, it had passed 1 million views.\n\nNow his phone was filled with hundreds of messages. Sad faces, angry faces, Palestinian flags. Strangers zoomed in on the woman\u2019s face, rushing to identify her. They zoomed in on Ash\u2019s son, who had been on the ground at one point, holding something small and red. An Israeli hostage poster, someone online said, though it was only an empty bag of chips, crinkling in his hands. One person sent close-ups of the coffee cup the woman had thrown, identifying the logo of the bakery where it had been purchased. People told Ash how well he handled the situation, how calm he\u2019d kept his voice. More than one person said they would have punched the woman in the face, if it had been them that day.\n\nAsh didn\u2019t want to punch the woman. He\u2019d tried to de-escalate the situation. He considered himself a nonviolent person, in large part because of two things that had happened in his life. The first came when he was 17 years old. He was arrested for stealing from a London department store and spent four months in prison. Anger was all around him there, and he told himself that in order to survive, he would need to become a different person \u2014 someone who didn\u2019t react. One morning, when a guard pinned him against the wall and shouted racist slurs, Ash just looked at him and let him yell. He became a person who said, \u201cOkay,\u201d if he said anything at all.\n\nThe second thing happened years later, after he had begun a career in politics. He joined a team working for former prime minister Tony Blair, the Middle East peace envoy at the time. In 2011, the job took Ash to the West Bank, where he received his kaffiyeh as a gift. That same year, he traveled to Sierra Leone, where he sat in on reconciliation meetings as the country healed from a decade-long civil war. He watched a mother face the child soldier who had been accused of killing her son and daughter. Here was a chance for vengeance, but when the council asked what punishment the soldier should face, the mother asked for the boy to be released into her own care, and to raise him as her own. It was a life-changing moment for Ash. He began to think of himself as an abolitionist, a person who stood against forms of oppression and occupation. It was a feeling that only deepened as he moved to the United States, met and married Mary, and worked as a human rights activist and political strategist for campaigns and criminal justice groups.\n\nIn Gaza, Ash had long seen another system of oppression. After Oct. 7, when Hamas militants killed at least 1,200 people and took hundreds hostage in Israel, he and Mary began organizing pressure campaigns for a permanent cease-fire. They used words like \u201cgenocide\u201d to talk about Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza, where the death toll would climb past 25,000 in the weeks to come, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Along with a few activists, they spent their days documenting firsthand accounts from the region to send to reporters and government officials.\n\nAsh wanted the person who attacked him and his son to be held accountable, but he also worried about the anger stirred up by the video of the confrontation he'd posted online.\n\nAsh and his wife, Mary, dress their son at their Brooklyn home.\n\nNow, seeing the outrage on his own Instagram feed, where strangers were promising to \u201cfind\u201d the woman in the video, he began to worry about what all the anger could turn into. He posted a message urging restraint: \u201cIf you think you know this person please share the information but don\u2019t take this in your own hands. We have never asked for that and we do not want that. This is not vigilante justice.\u201d\n\nBut the messages kept coming.\n\nTwo strangers contacted Ash to say they recognized the woman from their gym. They each gave him the same name. \u201cI do not have any doubt about who she is,\u201d one of them said.\n\nHe looked up the woman\u2019s name online. He read old comments he thought she\u2019d left on YouTube videos. He wondered if he might pass her on the street. He sent the name to the detective assigned to his case, and now the detective was on the phone, sounding out the same name.\n\n\u201cHer name is, like, Hadasa \u2026 Kara \u2014 vani? Karavani \u2014 Bozak?\u201d\n\nAsh and Mary, 44, sat at their kitchen counter, listening.\n\nNow the detective was asking if Ash had seen any other photos of the woman online that he could send. It would help make a positive identification and ensure an indictment, he said.\n\n\u201cThe big deal is getting her prosecuted, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, okay, understood,\u201d Ash said. \u201cWe\u2019ll look around.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust to confirm, you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt,\u201d the detective said.\n\nMary didn\u2019t speak until the call was over.\n\n\u201cSo we need to do the work for them, is basically what they\u2019re saying,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWell, we need to do a search,\u201d Ash said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to do their job for them. That\u2019s my opinion,\u201d Mary said. \u201cI think it\u2019s not very valuable for us, for our own mental space.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ash said. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it upsets you a lot.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nAsh stared at his laptop, where a Google search for the name was still open in his browser.\n\n\u201cI might email them and say they should look at the immigration database,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Mary said.\n\n\u201cNo? Okay. Let them do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gotta let that go.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, but a few hours later, when Mary and their son were out, Ash was looking through his messages again. \u201cMy wife and I have to constantly look over our shoulders and don\u2019t feel safe out and about with our baby,\u201d he\u2019d written in an email to the detective the day before. \u201cIt\u2019s not a nice feeling at all.\u201d\n\nThe gym must have a photo on file. The bakery must have security footage. They weren\u2019t far away.\n\nHe got his coat and his scarf and walked out the door.\n\nOutside his building, he passed lampposts where someone had taped fliers.\n\n\u201cHATE CRIME: ATTACKED 18 MONTH OLD,\u201d they read.\n\n\u201cDo you recognize her?\u201d\n\nFliers were posted around Ash's neighborhood asking for information about the woman who had attacked him and his son.\n\nA few blocks away, a woman sat in her apartment looking at messages on her phone.\n\n\u201c \u2026 You vile human being!!!!!!\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 YOU ARE EVIL.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 You thought you wouldn\u2019t be found?\u201d\n\nHer name was Annette Lalic.\n\nDid she look like the woman in the video? She had short, dark hair like the woman did, but that\u2019s where the similarities ended. She lived in another part of Brooklyn. She worked as a lawyer for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and at 10:19 a.m. on that Tuesday, as Ash pressed the record button in Brooklyn, she was at her office in Lower Manhattan, preparing for mediation in a discrimination case.\n\nTwo days later, Annette, 38, was working from home, just after lunch, when the first message came. A notification from Instagram said she had been tagged in a photo. It was a picture she hadn\u2019t seen before: a woman in a hat and sunglasses. The logo on the hat was familiar to her, from a Brooklyn running store she went to often. Now she had a text from a friend at the store: \u201cCall me when you get this.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething weird is going on online,\u201d her friend said.\n\nSomehow, from the hat in the video, people had found a picture of Annette wearing a hat on the running store\u2019s website. The hats didn\u2019t look the same, she thought, but it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cHer name is Annette Marie Lalic,\u201d someone said online. Now she watched part of the 47-second video and searched her name on social media. Someone had posted her photo next to screenshots from the video, with arrows pointing to each woman\u2019s chin, nose and jawline. \u201c100% is Annette Lalic,\u201d the person had written.\n\nShe felt herself begin to panic.\n\nShe went to a neighbor\u2019s apartment across the hall.\n\n\u201cDo I respond to this?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s slow down,\u201d her neighbor said.\n\n\u201cHow do I even prove that it\u2019s not me? Clearly, it\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nAnnette Lalic, a lawyer for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, was misidentified as the assailant in the attack on Ash and his son.\n\nFriends told her to stay off the internet, but Annette wanted to know what the people online knew, in case of a threat. She went through more messages. \u201cTwo blocks down \u2026 they\u2019re watching you. When you least expect it,\u201d one person wrote to her on Instagram, with an emoji of a gust of wind. What did the wind emoji mean? She didn\u2019t know. She saw people post her old home address, her work address, her license number from the New York State Bar Association. They called her office in Manhattan. They found her LinkedIn, so she deactivated her account. There were friends and acquaintances on Reddit and Instagram, and neighborhood group chats for parents, all saying it wasn\u2019t her.\n\n\u201cThis is misinformation! The woman in the video is NOT Annette Lalic!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not her. I used to work with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can also confirm it is not Annette.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Your life will be hell from now on.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 You SLUT.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 You\u2019re sick.\u201d\n\nVoice mails filled her inbox.\n\n\u201c \u2026 You\u2019re disgusting. Know that, all right? You\u2019re a disgusting human being. I don\u2019t even want to call you a human being.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 Annette, do you call yourself a woman? You are a barbarian.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 You stupid, racist, Jewish b----.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 Quit hiding, you f---ing p---y, Annette.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoxed,\u201d she wrote in her planner beneath the date.\n\nShe went to bed and thought about what to do next. She could issue a statement of her own saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d She could record a video of herself reading the statement. Surely, as soon as people heard her voice and saw her face up close, they would realize it wasn\u2019t her. \u201cYou need to do this,\u201d some friends had told her. She wondered if people even cared whether it was her or whether it wasn\u2019t. She had already seen one commenter say, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like her,\u201d to which another replied, \u201cAgree to disagree.\u201d There was no logic here. She decided to do nothing.\n\nAnnette described feelings of fear and guilt after being falsely accused of attacking Ash and his son.\n\nThe days passed, and now, as people kept telling her how terrible she was, her panic gave way to a new feeling, one she hadn\u2019t expected. It was a feeling of guilt \u2014 as if she really had done something wrong, \u201cas if I\u2019d actually done what the woman had done,\u201d she thought. The guilt was peculiar \u2014 detached and almost out-of-body. Physically, she was at home, eating dinner next to her cat. \u201cThis is me,\u201d she told herself. She was fine, but the messages kept coming, telling her that she was not.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I will make sure the whole world knows that you are racist,\u201d one said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not who I am,\u201d she told herself.\n\n\u201c \u2026 We\u2019re gonna see you out in the street.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not real,\u201d she told herself.\n\nOn the day Ash left his apartment to search for the woman, Annette was scheduled to coach a running group in Central Park but thought about staying home instead. \u201cDo what you\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d one of the other coaches told her. On the train, she looked around and wondered if people were staring at her. How many knew her face as the face in the video?\n\nShe got off the train, walked into the park, coached the group and was starting to leave when she heard someone shout her name.\n\n\u201cAnnette!\u201d\n\nHer stomach dropped. Panic.\n\nShe turned around. It was only someone she knew, a friend coming up to her to say hi.\n\nAsh and Mary walk their son to the park.\n\nAsh was still out searching. Seven blocks west, past the playground, past more fliers, past a crossing guard on the corner who stopped him and said someone told her just yesterday that the woman in the video was an attorney.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ash said to her, knowing she meant Annette. He had already heard about what happened to her. He had thought about contacting her, but what would he even say? Instead, he told the crossing guard: \u201cIt\u2019s not her. I think I know who the woman is. I\u2019m just trying to find her now.\u201d\n\nHe walked another 13 blocks to the gym, where the people behind the front desk said they couldn\u2019t give out private information. Another seven blocks back to the bakery, where the people behind the counter said they would check their security footage and get back to him. Six blocks back to his neighborhood. It was getting dark now. From the street, he called the detective again and told him about his trip to the gym, and the bakery, and that\u2019s when the detective told him that they didn\u2019t need any more photos of the woman. They had an arrest warrant.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Ash said. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\n\nHe headed home, walked inside and kicked off his boots.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re gonna arrest her,\u201d Ash said.\n\nMary stood at the kitchen counter chopping onions.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhile Ash had been out on his search, she had been looking at news from overseas. A video from al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, showing premature babies crying. Another video from the West Bank, showing two boys, one 8, one 14, shot in the street.\n\n\u201cMer?\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d she said. Her voice was low. She kept chopping. \u201cYou know how I feel about it.\u201d\n\nHe did know. Earlier that week, Ash had told her, \u201cMary, you might have punched her in the face,\u201d and Mary had said, \u201cI wonder what I would have done.\u201d Maybe she would have snapped, she said, or maybe she would have picked up their son and run. \u201cYou don\u2019t know until you\u2019re in the situation,\u201d Ash said, and that was the difference between them. Ash had been there. Mary hadn\u2019t. And now they were processing the same event in their own way. While Ash was becoming more and more focused on the arrest, Mary sometimes noticed herself getting quiet.\n\nAsh took off his scarf and coat. \u201cThey\u2019re issuing an arrest warrant,\u201d he said again. \u201cLike, I think they might actually pick her up today.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Mary said.\n\n\u201cWhich means, \u2018Yay,\u2019\u201d Ash said.\n\n\u201cMhmm.\u201d\n\n\u201cA little bit of relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mary said. She paused. She didn\u2019t want her son to be hurt. \u201cObviously,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want other kids to be hurt.\u201d She kept her head down. \u201cBut it\u2019s all sad. Like, the whole thing is just \u2026\u201d\n\nNow she stood in the kitchen and began to cry.\n\n\u201cThe emotion \u2026 it\u2019s up here,\u201d she said, putting a hand to her neck.\n\n\u201cHey, come here. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nAsh walked to the other side of the counter and put his arms around her.\n\nMary took a deep breath. \u201cSo what\u2019s the next thing for us?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs the state going to prosecute her? Or the city? Do we have a say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I actually don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have a say.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we do have a say, what do we want to do?\u201d\n\nAsh was invited to speak at pro-Palestinian demonstrations after the video of him and his son being attacked went viral.\n\nNo matter how many times they discussed it, Ash and Mary couldn\u2019t come up with an answer.\n\nThey thought an arrest might bring some clarity. But the arrest did not happen that night, as Ash thought it would. It did not happen the next day, or the next, or the day after that. The weekend came and still no arrest. Ash was still getting messages, and in between his Instagram posts about Gaza, he wrote updates about the case to his followers, which in a matter of weeks had grown from several hundred to 10,000. He was invited to speak at two pro-Palestinian demonstrations, and he accepted. People in the neighborhood recognized him on the street. He was becoming the face of something.\n\nHe could sense people becoming impatient, and he understood their frustration.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s taking them so long?\u201d someone asked in the comments of one of Ash\u2019s posts.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?!\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cRelease the name.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease we need her full name.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna snowball,\u201d the detective had warned him, and it had, so much so that Ash was now worried about the woman\u2019s safety. What if someone attacked her? He thought about what had happened to Annette, and imagined worse. \u201cSomeone is going to make a citizen\u2019s arrest,\u201d Mary told him.\n\nProtesters watch as Ash speaks at a New York rally opposing the ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.\n\nNow there was a new message.\n\nSomeone had seen the woman at a grocery store in Brooklyn.\n\nThe person had taken photos. They\u2019d called the precinct and waited at the store for the police. No police came. No arrest was made. Ash was also feeling impatient. He decided to post the photos to his Instagram. \u201cIt is disheartening to let you know that the NYPD didn\u2019t send an officer to the scene to apprehend her,\u201d he wrote, and more comments came streaming in.\n\nBut a few days later, he saw something that alarmed him. It was a new video about the case, from another stranger. This one named the woman and listed her home address.\n\n\u201cThis is not what I wanted,\u201d Ash said.\n\nHe called the detective. \u201cSomeone posted her address and her name online,\u201d he said, speaking quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t know who this person is, but I wanted to call you to tell you straight away \u2014\u201d\n\nThe detective stopped him. \u201cOkay, so, Ash,\u201d he said, \u201cI have her under arrest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have her under arrest?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have her under arrest.\u201d\n\nAsh and Mary's son plays at home in Brooklyn.\n\nAfter all this time, Ash had seen the woman only once, during that brief encounter at the playground. He could only guess what she had been doing in the days since. He\u2019d imagined her in a state of isolation, rarely leaving her apartment building, 12 blocks away from his own, where fliers of her face still hung outside on the street. He\u2019d studied the pictures from the grocery store, where she stood with a shopping basket on her arm, glancing at a bin of fresh fruit. But the woman was still a stranger to him, a person he could read about online, the same as anyone else.\n\nNow there was a chance to see her. Arraignments were open to the public.\n\nThe courthouse in Brooklyn was a 25-minute walk away, and the woman was already there.\n\nShe had turned herself in at 7 a.m. She\u2019d been in one of the holding pens downstairs since morning, waiting. All day there were arraignments. First-degree robbery. Second-degree harassment. The hours passed. It was evening now. \u201cWarning,\u201d read a sign on the stairwell door. Each time the door opened, yelling came from the floor below.\n\nThe door opened again and now it was almost midnight.\n\nThe woman walked into the courtroom, led by a police officer. She was short and small. Her hair was tied back. A black mask sat beneath her nose. Her fingernails were painted. Her hands were in handcuffs behind her back. In legal documents, her name was listed as Hadasa Bozakkaravani.\n\n\u201cHow do I say your last name?\u201d the judge said.\n\n\u201cKaravani,\u201d she told the judge.\n\n\u201cKaravani,\u201d he repeated. \u201cGood evening, Miss Karavani.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nAcross the aisle, a prosecutor approached a microphone and began to recount that morning in the playground for the judge. \u201cDefendant was a stranger to the complainant,\u201d she began.\n\n\u201cDefendant approached the complainant \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 stated in sum and substance: \u2018Why are you wearing that? You support Hamas. They kill babies. Your baby should die. You\u2019re a terrorist \u2026\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDefendant then threw a cellphone \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 threw a hot beverage \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 nearly striking the child \u2026\u201d\n\nBozakkaravani shook her head.\n\nHer lawyer introduced her to the court: forty-eight years old, a longtime Brooklyn resident and a first-time offender \u2014 zero contacts with the system, he told the judge. No warrant history. No absconding or escapes. No felonies. No misdemeanors. \u201cNothing,\u201d he said. She had turned herself in voluntarily. \u201cEverything went very smoothly.\u201d The complainant, \u201cby the way,\u201d he said, \u201cwent immediately onto social media and did every interview he could possibly do to explain what he believed occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, the court is aware of what is occurring politically, not only internationally, but out there on the streets.\u201d\n\nThe case should have been charged as a misdemeanor assault, he said, or a menacing, or an attempt of those things. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s been charged as a hate crime.\u201d\n\nBozakkaravani stared ahead.\n\nAt 12:11 a.m., some 16 hours after she\u2019d turned herself in, she was released without bail. She was handed a copy of an order of protection, barring her from contact with Ash and his son. The handcuffs came off. She left the courthouse with her lawyer, stepped outside and disappeared.\n\nBy that time, Ash and his family were asleep.\n\nInstead of going to the courthouse, he and Mary had stayed home. They were cooking dinner. Their son was in the living room. The television was on, and suddenly Ash heard a voice in his apartment. The local news was playing the video again.\n\n\u201cYou and your son, go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet away!\u201d\n\nHe turned off the TV and the sound was gone.\n\nAsh plays with his son at Edmonds Playground in Brooklyn, where the attack on them happened in early November.\n\nThe fliers in the neighborhood had come down. The mob that had found the wrong woman and misidentified an empty bag of potato chips had mostly moved onto another outrage. The online comments had slowed. It had been six weeks since that morning in the playground, but Ash still had one question he couldn\u2019t answer: What was an appropriate punishment for hate?\n\nHate is what it had been, he thought.\n\nAnd the charges that followed were serious: attempted assault as a hate crime, menacing as a hate crime, aggravated harassment and endangering the welfare of a child. Twelve counts in all.\n\nAfter her arraignment, Bozakkaravani had returned to court, this time to enter a plea.\n\nShe had yet to say anything publicly about the case. (She and her lawyer declined multiple interview requests for this story.) As she waited to see the judge, a tabloid photographer walked up to her and began to take pictures. She held a hand up to cover her face. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. She got up from the bench where she\u2019d been sitting and stood in a corner, turning her back to the camera. \u201cShe said no,\u201d said a man in the waiting room. \u201cShe said no, bro.\u201d The photographer took another picture. \u201cI\u2019m gonna knock your head off,\u201d the man said. The photographer stopped and a few minutes later, Bozakkaravani entered the courtroom and pleaded not guilty.\n\n\u201cJustice and mercy are hard,\u201d Mary had said to Ash as they discussed it one day.\n\n\u201cMercy isn\u2019t always the answer,\u201d she said.\n\nBut prison?\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nThe charges carried a maximum sentence of seven years, according to the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cIs there a path to reconciliation?\u201d Ash asked during another conversation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the question,\u201d Mary said.\n\n\u201cWhat is justice now?\u201d Ash asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mary said.\n\nAnother conversation:\n\n\u201cIt was a hypothetical. Now it\u2019s real,\u201d Ash said. \u201cMy feelings are more complex.\u201d\n\nSoon, the prosecutor would ask them what they thought the woman deserved.\n\nThey had contacted a few Palestinian friends for advice. One of them said the woman should be forced to attend a class about Palestine. Another said she should be forced to spend one day in jail, to have some idea of what it\u2019s like to be oppressed. Just one day.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t appear to be soft,\u201d Mary said during another conversation. They were back at the playground with their son.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s going to prison, okay, fine,\u201d Ash said, \u201cbut they need to put the same energy that they put into this into everything else \u2014 every hate crime.\u201d\n\nThey were still talking when they heard a cry.\n\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d Ash said.\n\nIt was their son. He had tripped near the entrance to the basketball court.\n\nAsh and Mary ran to him. They wiped some dirt off his pants. They wiped a small bit of blood from a scrape on his forehead. They hugged him until he stopped crying, and then, distracted for a moment from their conversation about hate and the question they still could not answer, Ash helped him to his feet, held out his hand and guided him back onto the court.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go so that you can play,\u201d he said."
