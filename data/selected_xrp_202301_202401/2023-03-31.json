        "content": "Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive officer of Ripple Labs, has called on lawmakers in the United States to look into assertive statements made by Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), about the American crypto industry.\n\nGarlinghouse\u2019s comments come as Gensler told a House Appropriations Committee in a recent hearing that there is no need for additional legislation for crypto assets, as already existing securities laws are sufficient for regulating the sector.\n\nGensler\u2019s Assertions are \u201cBeyond Comprehension\u201d\n\nIn a tweet, the Ripple CEO insisted that the SEC chair\u2019s assertions are beyond comprehension. Urging elected officials to notice Gensler\u2019s actions, Garlinghouse pointed out that the SEC is subject to the legislation as the agency derives its power from there.\n\nGensler\u2019s belief that the SEC can determine which digital assets are securities is seen in his behavior as he has taken enforcement actions against several crypto firms in the past few months.\n\nAt the hearing, the SEC chair noted that although Congress could act to provide clearer legislation for the crypto sector, the agency did not need additional authorities to determine which assets were securities or not. He insisted that the SEC is in charge of defining securities and not legislation.\n\nIn contrast, Garlinghouse believes crypto should be regulated by legislation and not from the SEC\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cFor the Chair of the SEC to assert that he dictates what is a security \u2013 and not the legislation from which his agency derives its power \u2013 is beyond comprehension. It\u2019s time for elected officials in the U.S. to take notice,\u201d the Ripple boss stated.\n\nAn \u201cAutocrat\u201d Running a Bloated Agency\n\nGarlinghouse further accused Gensler of behaving like an autocrat. The Ripple CEO insisted that the SEC chairman felt he did not need regulatory clarity because he ran a bloated agency.\n\n\u201cWhen you behave like an autocrat running a $2.2B bloated agency, why would you ever want to provide clarity about what\u2019s \u201cin or out\u201d? Without clear jurisdiction, ambiguity masquerades as power,\u201d Garlinghouse said.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC and Ripple have been in a two-year-long legal battle over securities law violations. The agency sued Ripple in 2020 for offering unregistered securities by selling XRP tokens. The court is expected to give its verdict on the case before the end of the year."

        "content": "Fiona Murray\u2019s five year journey at Ripple has truly been something to behold. She began her career at the Ripple London office as a Sales Director building new customer relationships across Europe. As Ripple continued to expand and opened up an office in Singapore, a position as Head of Sales for APAC became available.\n\nWith the reputation she\u2019d developed as an expert in her field, Fiona made the bold choice to pursue the position and was soon packing her bags to move across the world with her family.\n\n\u201cRipple was super supportive of my ambition. They saw that energy, that excitement and that focus from me, and decided to give me the opportunity to prove it.\u201d\n\nThe crypto industry moves fast, and Fiona hit the ground running once she settled into life in Singapore. While she and her team are excited to be on the cutting edge of innovative new technologies in the APAC region, selling crypto solutions to traditional finance professionals can be somewhat uncharted territory.\n\nFortunately, the team tackled the challenge straight on with direction from Fiona to embrace Ripple\u2019s \u201cSay It\u201d value through an abundance of transparency and constructive feedback. As a global company with customers from a variety of backgrounds, Ripple prioritizes creating a company culture reflective of those diverse communities.\n\nThat\u2019s why Fiona stresses the importance of open communication to her teammates; welcoming diverse perspectives and out-of-the-box ideas is vital to developing the right messaging to potential customers.\n\n\u201cAt Ripple, what is the best feeling is that we\u2019re changing the way that people operate and interact with value, and it\u2019s a really bold mission.\u201d\n\nBut Fiona isn\u2019t just helping pioneer the future of finance, she\u2019s also paving the way for other women to lead in male-dominated industries.\n\nWhile Ripple has made it a priority to support career growth and development for all employees, there is still work to be done across the globe. A LinkedIn study found that one in three women in APAC consider gender a barrier to opportunity. Compounding this, almost half of the women surveyed said they struggle to find a balance between work and family.\n\nFiona shared similar concerns when she went on parental leave after her son was born. But through preparation of her own and trust in her team, Fiona was able to enjoy her time with her family without any added stress itching at the corners of her mind.\n\n\u201cIn Sales, your pay is commission-based so it can feel frightening if you\u2019re taking yourself out of your territory for a while. Ripple takes a lot of that concern away.\u201d\n\nFiona has since been promoted to VP of APAC Sales and continues to drive bold innovation across the region.\n\nLearn more about building real-world value with teams across the globe."

He has previously served as the CEO of Hightail, a file-sharing service, and is also an active angel investor. He is currently serving as the CEO of financial technology company Ripple Labs.

EntrepreneurInvestorChief Executive OfficerBoard Member , CEO of Ripple, launched a new attack on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). gary gensler gary gensler Gary Gensler is an enthusiastic leader and the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He has the extreme experience that spans wall street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. He announced several initiatives to enhance investor protections in the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market. He previously led the Biden-Harris transition\u2019s federal reserve, Banking, and securities regulation agency review team.

Gary Gensler will probably keep on filling in as seat of the SEC until 2026, accepting his renunciation. He has expressed his desires to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. A few officials as well as his kindred SEC magistrates have scrutinized Gensler for not giving adequate administrative direction on crypto, possibly prompting a standoff between Congress and the association. The SEC, CFTC, and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network handle advanced resource guidelines in the U.S., however, each with various jurisdictional cases, bringing about an interwoven methodology that crypto firms should explore to work legitimately. Whether 2022 will see a more clear way for organizations in the crypto space is questionable, yet the cosmetics of the SEC's initiative will fundamentally change following the takeoff of chief Elad Roisman in the first month of the year. Chief Allison Lee's term is likewise set to terminate in June 2022.

Garlinghouse responded to a news story in which Gensler claimed that the industry is already covered by current regulations, so no new legislation is required.\n\nTo which Garlinghouse responded, \u201cFor the Chair of the SEC to assert that he dictates what is a security \u2013 and not the legislation from which his agency derives its power \u2013 is beyond comprehension. It\u2019s time for elected officials in the US to take notice.\u201d\n\nAs long as the SEC head acts like an autocrat in charge of a $2.2 billion bloated agency, the authority will never want to be clear about which crypto assets are \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout.\u201d Garlinghouse emphasized that ambiguity can pass for authority in the absence of clear jurisdiction.\n\nAlso Read: David Gokhshtein Predicts XRP Price Surge if Ripple Prevails in SEC Case\n\nGarlinghouse\u2019s Opinions Echo Those of Crypto Stakeholders\n\nThe crypto community has long expressed its concerns about the SEC\u2019s approach to Crypto. The commission recently increased its regulatory efforts against the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nJustin Sun, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, and his businesses are the targets of a new lawsuit from the Commission. Moreover, for failing to register as a national securities exchange, the financial authority also brought charges against the cryptocurrency platform Beaxy.\n\nThe legal battle between SEC and Ripple is nearing its end with several crypto attorneys predicting a win for the crypto firm.
