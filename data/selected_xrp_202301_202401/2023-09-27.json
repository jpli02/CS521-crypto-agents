        "content": "Ripple\u2019s (XRP) chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, asserted that Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman, is set to make statements that may be misleading during his appearance before the Senate Committee on Financial Services.\n\nIn a Sept. 27 post on his X(formerly Twitter) account, Alderoty contended that Gensler might assert the existence of a \u2018crypto asset securities market\u2019 and suggest that tokens inherently qualify as investment contracts.\n\nAccording to Alderoty, this statement is false, considering Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 landmark ruling in Ripple\u2019s case against the financial watchdog. He said:\n\n\u201cPerhaps just one representative will read this line from the Court\u2019s 7/13/23 decision in the Ripple case: \u201cXRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a \u201ccontract, transaction[,], or scheme\u201d that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract.\u201d\n\nWhat Gensler plans to say\n\nSEC Chair Gensler is set to double down on his views that the crypto industry falls under the purview of the Commission, according to his written testimony for the Senate Committee on Financial Services.\n\nGensler reiterated his opinion that \u201cmost crypto tokens are subject to the securities laws,\u201d adding that the crypto industry was rife with non-compliance with existing laws. Per his statement, crypto intermediaries, like exchanges, must also comply with securities laws.\n\nThe SEC Chair further touted some of the rule-making efforts of the Commission, saying:\n\n\u201cThe SEC also has addressed the crypto security markets through rulemaking. We issued a reopening release that reiterated the applicability of existing rules to platforms that trade crypto asset securities, including so-called \u201cDeFi\u201d systems. This release also provided supplemental information for systems that would be included in a new, proposed exchange definition.\u201d\n\nHe concluded that the SEC has brought enforcement actions against wrongdoers to promote investor protection.\n\nGensler\u2019s strict regulatory approach towards the crypto industry has drawn criticism from stakeholders who have highlighted how the SEC was stretching decades-old securities laws to emerging crypto finance models like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "3 Things That Could Cause Ripple (XRP) to Explode This Year - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ripple has been caught in an ongoing legal battle against the SEC for almost three years now, and it seems Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse are fully committed to fighting the regulatory agency until they get a decisive victory.\n\nWhile the XRP community is eager to see the latest developments in the case, here are three things that could cause Ripple (XRP) to explode in 2023.\n\nRipple Wins: Judge Torres Denies SEC Appeal\n\nIf Judge Analisa Torres denies the SEC appeal against Ripple, not only could it possibly bring price appreciation for XRP but also push regulators and lawmakers across different jurisdictions in the US to work on a clear and thorough regulatory framework for cryptocurrency assets.\n\nBack in July, XRP surged over 70% after Judge Torres stated that XRP is not a security. The SEC immediately moved forward to appeal the ruling, stating that this decision could affect other cryptocurrency-related cases.\n\nHowever, these cases are nowhere similar to Ripple\u2019s, considering how different XRP\u2019s underlying infrastructure is from most DeFi tokens. That just means the SEC is putting all their eggs in a single basket.\n\nUS Institutions Integrating ODL\n\nA major issue with today\u2019s payment infrastructure is poor data flow between intermediaries, causing delays and added expenses to payments. This is where ODL, On-Demand Liquidity, can trigger a massive uptick for XRP.\n\nODL is RippleNet\u2019s liquidity management solution, a product that customers, such as financial institutions, can leverage to execute cross-border payments instantly and seamlessly without intermediaries.\n\nThe gist of ODL is that liquidity is sourced from a pool filled with XRP, and the cost of sourcing this liquidity is low because it only occurs when there\u2019s demand \u2014 hence the name.\n\nFollowing July\u2019s partial victory, Ripple representatives expect several American financial institutions will move forward with implementing ODL to their platforms or at least feel more comfortable talking about the problems they experience with their business when it comes to payment rails and cross-border transactions.\n\nSettlement Between Ripple and the SEC\n\nWhat effects a theoretical (but probable) settlement between Ripple and the SEC would have on XRP\u2019s price depends heavily on the terms and conditions in that agreement.\n\nBut, to be fair, most crypto projects that had battled against the SEC have agreed to a settlement; they pay a specified amount to the SEC, and the case is dropped.\n\nDue to the negative implications, a settlement wouldn\u2019t be the best news for XRP, which is already down 70% from its previous highs in July, back to $0.50 at the time of writing.\n\nWhile it can allow founders to go back to focus on Ripple instead of legal battles with the SEC, its founders have expressed they have no intentions for a settlement and instead want to fight the SEC all the way through."

        "title": "MOVEit Bug's Ripple Effect Still Unfolding | Decipher - Duo Security",
        "content": "\u201cUnfortunately, not all organizations might even be aware that they have this vulnerable software as a part of their (indirect) tech stack from another supplier upstream.\"\n\nWhile zero-day vulnerabilities typically make headlines when they are first disclosed, they have lasting long-term impacts in the ensuing weeks, months and years, as threat actors continue to target unpatched instances. In fact, an August report from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) found that the majority of the flaws that attackers routinely exploited over the last year were disclosed in 2021 or earlier, including the Log4Shell flaw from 2021, the ProxyShell bugs in Exchange from 2021 and a Fortinet SSL VPN bug from 2018.\n\nFor MOVEit, many of the attacks occurred during an initial rampage on vulnerable MOVEit Transfer servers by the threat actors linked to the Clop ransomware. Some researchers said that they first saw this exploit activity on May 27, while others saw scanning for the MOVEit Transfer logging page as early as March 3 (months before the bug became public on May 31). While victim disclosures are still steadily continuing, many disclosures are stemming from this initial surge. For instance, though it only recently disclosed details on the impact of its breach, National Student Clearinghouse first learned on June 20 that the unauthorized actor had accessed files on May 30.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still very successful [for threat actors] as far as we know, it\u2019s having a continued impact on a variety of industries and we\u2019re nowhere near to seeing the total impact of that,\u201d said Glenn Thorpe, senior director of Security Research and Detection Engineering with GreyNoise. \u201cWe know MOVEit is not over yet - actors haven\u2019t moved away from it and it hasn\u2019t stopped being fruitful for them.\u201d\n\nThe obvious lesson here, both with the MOVEit Transfer bug and with other actively exploited flaws, is to patch vulnerabilities that are serious or under active exploitation as soon as possible. In a new survey looking at top exploited vulnerabilities of this year, Qualys researchers calculated that the flaw had a mean time to response/remediate (MTTR) of seven days. This data point, which shows the average time taken to address the vulnerability after detection, is low in comparison to other vulnerabilities like the PaperCut NG/MF bug (CVE-2023-27350), which had an MTTR of 23 days, and the Fortra GoAnywhere MFT remote code execution flaw (CVE-2023-0669) that had one of 31 days. However, Qualys researchers found that the flaw had a patch rate of just over 51 percent, showing that many systems are still exposed.\n\nBeyond patching, however, part of the complexity of the MOVEit bug is that many of the impacted organizations don\u2019t use the software themselves, but instead are part of this \u201ctrickle-down\u201d data breach effect. These impacted organizations and individuals should be on alert for phishing emails that may use their stolen data or fraud-related attacks.\n\n\u201cDuring the early days of June, while our industry was first chasing indicators of compromise and looking for signs of exploitation, this certainly widened the pool of potential victims,\u201d said Hammond. \u201cUnfortunately, not all organizations might even be aware that they have this vulnerable software as a part of their (indirect) tech stack from another supplier upstream.\u201d\n\nOverall, flaws like the ones in MOVEIt Transfer highlight a need for better security practices from manufacturers themselves, particularly for those behind file transfer services that handle a rich bank of data that\u2019s attractive to cybercriminals. The MOVEit bug has left questions about software liability in its wake, and several lawsuits have cropped up over the past months - including ones against Progress Software itself, but also several against companies using the MOVEit Transfer platform.\n\n\u201cThe CVE-2023-34362 flaw in MOVEit Transfer signals potential long-term shifts in cybersecurity,\u201d Saeed Abbasi, manager of vulnerability and threat research at Qualys. \u201cMuch like the repercussions from Heartbleed on open-source security, this vulnerability highlights the imperative for strengthened secure development practices. It's a definite call for organizations to intensify their vulnerability assessments, engage in rigorous penetration testing, transition towards zero-trust models, and accelerate a surge in cybersecurity investment. Such high-profile vulnerabilities can spur re-evaluations of vendor trust and catalyze stricter regulatory oversight.\u201d"
