        "content": "Police said Christian Myers was a suspect in a shots fired incident that happened Jan. 29 in Broad Ripple.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 A man shot and injured by IMPD officers after a chase late last month is now facing criminal charges.\n\nChristian Myers, 22, has been charged with attempted murder, battery, criminal recklessness, possession of a machine gun and resisting law enforcement, all felonies, along with misdemeanor counts of unlawful possession of a firearm by a domestic batterer and battery resulting in bodily injury.\n\nLast week, IMPD identified the three officers who shot and critically injured Myers on Sunday, Jan. 29 on the city's northeast side.\n\nZachary Boston, a three-year veteran; Andrew Girt, a 15-year veteran; and Jacob Liebhauser, a three-year veteran, shot Myers.\n\nThe incident started Sunday morning in Broad Ripple and resulted in a police chase that ended in a crash later in the afternoon, IMPD said.\n\nAccording to IMPD, officers responded to the 100 block of Broad Ripple Avenue, near Broad Ripple Park, around 3 a.m. for a report of shots fired. A woman told officers she was involved a dispute with the father of her child, who she said fired at least one shot, hitting her car as she drove away.\n\nDetectives responded to the scene to begin an investigation and search for the suspect, Myers.\n\nThey found Myers outside a car at the BP gas station at the intersection of East 38th Street and East Fall Creek Parkway North Drive just after 4 p.m.\n\nOfficers attempted to stop Myers, who got into a car and drove away, leading police on a chase. He eventually crashed into an uninvolved car near the intersection of Binford Boulevard and Kessler Boulevard East Drive.\n\nNo one was injured in the crash.\n\nMyers and another man inside the car ran westbound across Binford Boulevard, through a ditch and over a fence.\n\nMyers then fired shots at officers in the area of 5800 Winding Way Lane, just northwest of Kessler Boulevard East Drive and Binford Boulevard, and three officers returned fire, shooting Myers, IMPD said.\n\nMyers was taken to Methodist Hospital in critical condition. Police have not provided an update on his condition since Monday afternoon, when he remained critical.\n\nThe second person who ran from police, identified as a 24-year-old man, was taken to Eskenazi Hospital for a complaint of chest pain. Police said there is no indication this man fired any shots at officers. Detectives arrested the 24-year-old man for resisting law enforcement.\n\nNo officers were injured.\n\nIMPD Officer Joshua Barker said Sunday evening it was too early to tell how many shots were fired in the shooting.\n\nDetectives located a handgun with an extended magazine outside the passenger door of the suspect car, and a handgun with an extended magazine and Glock switch where the suspect who fired shots at officers was found, police said.\n\nMultiple body-worn cameras were activated during the incident, police said.\n\nThe Marion County Prosecutor's Office will make final charging decisions in the case.\n\nThe IMPD Critical Incident Response Team is investigating the incident, and a separate administrative investigation is being conducted by IMPD Internal Affairs.\n\nBoston, Girt and Liebhauser have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in officer-involved shootings.\n\nThe civilian-majority Use of Force Review Board will conduct a mandatory hearing after the criminal process concludes.\n\nAnyone with information on the incident is asked to contact Detective Sergeant Erika Jones at the IMPD Homicide Office by calling 317-327-3475."

        "title": "Indianapolis crime: Police involved in shooting on city's northeast side - IndyStar",
        "content": "Update:This article was updated after police announced charging information against the suspect. On Feb. 3, 2023, Indianapolis police released the following names of the officers involved in the shooting: 3-year veteran Zachary Boston, 15-year veteran Andrew Girt and 3-year veteran Officer Jacob Liebhauser.\n\nA man was in critical condition after he was shot while exchanging gunfire with police Sunday afternoon, officials said.\n\nNo officer was injured in the incident. A second person who was with the injured man at the time of the shooting was also taken to the hospital with chest pains.\n\nThe series of events started about 4 p.m. at a gas station on 38th Street and Fall Creek Road when Indianapolis Metropolitan Police officers attempted to stop a car carrying the two men. Police wanted to talk to the men because one is accused of shooting a car belonging to his child's mother in Broad Ripple hours earlier, officers said.\n\nIndianapolis police on Monday identified the man wanted in the Broad Ripple shooting as 22-year-old Christian Myers.\n\nMyers, identified by police as the driver, fled the scene, and a car chase ensued until the vehicle crashed at Binford and Kessler boulevards. Both men then ran and officers chased them, said Deputy Chief Joshua Barker.\n\nMoments later, Myers is accused of shooting at police, and three officers returned fire, striking him, Barker said.\n\nBoth men were transported to the hospital, and detectives have placed them under arrest in the aftermath. The Marion County Prosecutor's Office is weighing charges against Myers in connection with the shooting, though the 22-year-old faces charges of intimidation, criminal recklessness, unlawful possession of a firearm by a domestic batterer and battery stemming from the Broad Ripple shooting involving his child's mother. Police are not naming the second suspect involved \"given his limited role,\" a news release from the department stated.\n\nInvestigators recovered two firearms from the scene \u2014 one outside the suspect\u2019s vehicle and the other where he was shot. Both had extended magazines, and one had a Glock switch, Barker said. Glock switches allow a firearm to shoot multiple rounds with one trigger pull.\n\nPolice closed southbound Binford Boulevard, north of Kessler Boulevard, in both directions while processing the scene."
