        "content": "David Schwartz thinks real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is primed to \u201cdrive the blockchain economy.\u201d\n\nSchwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer (CTO), predicts that real estate and commodities will lead to RWA tokenization.\n\n\u201cTokenized RWAs on XRP Ledger will enhance collateralized loans, improve interoperability, and attract institutional adoption, reshaping the financial sector. XRPL will be a leading blockchain enabling these use cases.\u201d\n\nThe CTO is also excited about decentralized identifiers (DIDs), which can verify the identity of a person or subject without relying on third parties like trusted validators and centralized entities.\n\nSchwartz says DIDs will \u201crevolutionize privacy on the blockchain\u201d and drive demand for decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\n\u201cDEXs, empowered by DIDs, will see increased institutional volume, driving growth and liquidity in decentralized finance. The proposed XLS-40 amendment introduces DID capabilities to XRP Ledger, marking a new era in privacy, security, and financial innovation.\u201d\n\nThe Ripple executive also thinks stablecoins are primed to change the composition of global finance and reduce dependence on the US dollar.\n\n\u201cThe Middle East will lead in stablecoin adoption for regional trades. Financial institutions standardizing integration with blockchains will pave the way for stablecoins as a universal tool, streamlining international transactions and unlocking new economic potential.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ripple Price Prediction: Will XRP Drop Below $0.60? - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The price of XRP continues to trade narrowly between $0.62 and $0.61 this week. This consolidation stands in contrast to major gains seen by other top 20-ranked digital assets like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) over the same period.\n\nAccording to recent on-chain analysis, decreasing trading volume for XRP seems to be a key factor holding back its price trajectory as the broader altcoin market rallies.\n\nData from the crypto trading platform Coinglass shows that daily trading volume for XRP has declined sharply over the past week, even as its price trended downward. After hitting a peak of $0.69 last week, XRP has since dropped to around $0.61 at press time.\n\nHigh trading volumes tend to signal strong market demand and high levels of economic activity around a coin. When trading activity declines at the same time broader market prices are rising, it often indicates waning investor interest and profit-seeking speculation in an asset compared to its competitors.\n\nAlso read: Here\u2019s How to Be a Millionaire When Ripple XRP Hits $1\n\nWill XRP drop below $0.60?\n\nWith major altcoins like Avalanche, Cardano, and Solana posting historic double-digit price spikes this past week, XRP\u2019s simultaneous loss of trading volume points to investors shifting attention to those rising stars over the languishing Ripple token for their short-term bets. This dynamic weighs on XRP\u2019s price outlook.\n\nWithout a significant infusion of bullish news or market triggers, XRP seems poised to fall below $0.60 in the coming days as negative momentum continues to sap its trading activity.\n\nTo flip momentum and turn bullish again, XRP would need to break back above resistance at $0.67, where it peaked last week. Otherwise, failure by current holders to buy the dip could see prices cascade below $0.60. The next support level sits around $0.59.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Cryptocurrencies You Need Before the Next Bull Run\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nIn summary, Ripple\u2019s XRP token has diverged from broader altcoin market gains this past week as investors dump the formerly mainstream asset. However, the 24-hour trading volume has surged by 22.3% and now stands at $1,371,489,998."

        "title": "Ripple CEO slams SEC chair for 'stunning hypocrisy' - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Garlinghouse\u2019s comments stem from Gensler\u2019s recent statements about widespread noncompliance in the crypto industry. The regulator emphasized the detrimental impact of these actions on individuals, often leading to bankruptcy without adequate recourse.\n\nGensler said:\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of noncompliance in the crypto space. It undermines confidence when so many people have been hurt and all they can do is stand in line in the bankruptcy court. Further, this can make it hard for the good faith actors to compete.\u201d\n\nIn response, Garlinghouse accused Gensler of being hypocritical, pointing out that the SEC chief \u201ccozied up to the biggest fraud in recent memory.\u201d\n\nHe also furthered that Gensler\u2019s actions have harmed consumers and eroded the SEC\u2019s integrity while maintaining close ties with Wall Street.\n\nMeanwhile, this isn\u2019t the first instance of Garlinghouse\u2019s critique of Gensler. In earlier remarks, he likened Gensler\u2019s approach to that of an autocrat and urged Congress to take note of his conduct.\n\nGensler\u2019s crypto stance\n\nHowever, Chair Gensler has consistently defended his stance that the current securities laws are sufficient for the crypto industry, a position reflected in the SEC\u2019s rejection of Coinbase\u2019s request for new regulations.\n\nUnder Gensler, the Commission has filed several legal actions against major crypto firms like Coinbase and Binance, alleging that their operations violated securities law. Additionally, the regulator has labeled several large-cap cryptocurrencies, like Solana, Cardano, and Polygon, as crypto securities tokens in many of its legal actions.\n\nCommunity members lampoon SEC\n\nExpressing solidarity with Garlinghouse\u2019s sentiments, the broader crypto community has deemed Gensler a primary adversary of the emerging industry.\n\nGensler\u2019s strict regulatory approach towards the crypto industry has drawn criticism from stakeholders who have highlighted how the SEC was stretching decades-old securities laws to emerging crypto finance models like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nNotably, figures like Dogecoin founder Billy Markus have echoed these concerns, highlighting the absence of clear rules for the emerging sector."

        "title": "Ripple CTO Tags Elon Musk in Provocative Tweet - U.Today",
        "content": "Chief technology officer at Ripple blockchain decacorn and a cofounder of XRP Ledger David Schwartz has taken to the Twitter/X social media platform to publish a provocative message about the platform\u2019s owner, Elon Musk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwartz explained why he is doing that, prompting a wave of comments in response.\n\nRipple CTO 'challenges' Elon Musk and his billions of USD\n\nSchwartz wrote what quite a lot of people have written on Twitter about Musk over the past couple of years, hinting that he could solve the problems of all humanity by sharing his tremendous wealth with them.\n\nElon Musk is worth about 250 billion dollars. There are less than 8 billion people on Earth. That means he could give each of us a billion dollars and still have more than 242 billion dollars left. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 22, 2023\n\nThe tech mogul has a net worth of roughly $250 billion. With the global population comprising around eight billion (and continuing to grow at a rapid pace), Musk could give each person one billion USD, the Ripple CTO provocatively stated, and he would still have more than 242 billion U.S. dollars left for himself.\n\nSimilar calls on Musk were often heard last year, when he announced his intention to acquire Twitter. Back then, people wrote in their tweets that with those $44 billion, Musk could have solved the problem of hunger in Africa, and in the developing world in general, instead of spending this money on purchasing another company.\n\nHere\u2019s why Schwartz tagged Musk\n\nWhile those people\u2019s understanding of Musk and the hunger problem can be questioned, the Ripple CTO has explained the goal of today\u2019s tweet \u2013 he wants to \u201cget community noted,\u201d Schwartz wrote in a comment to his own post.\n\nI went to get community noted. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 22, 2023\n\nCommunity Notes is a service on the X platform that suggests corrections to published materials: tweets and articles shared by X users. This is how Elon Musk is trying to fight misinformation and unreliable data on his social media network. Recently, he introduced a new upgrade to Community Notes: notes will now appear under tweets much faster than before, by one hour. According to the tweet, this helps to move the system \u201cfrom a batch update process to real-time streaming infrastructure. The scorer now receives ratings via streaming rather than waiting for a batch update of new ratings.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s tweet introducing the upgrade sparked a wave of support and encouragement from the crypto community on Twitter."

        "title": "Expert Says No Settlement in Ripple Vs SEC Case Unless This Happens - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Attorney John Deaton, the founder of Crypto Law, issues fresh comments regarding a potential settlement in the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple.\n\nIn a recent interview on Thinking Crypto, Attorney Deaton speculated that there will be no settlement in the Ripple case due to the SEC\u2019s securities claim against other crypto projects.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSEC Claim Against Cardano Could Hinder Ripple Settlement\n\nNotably, Deaton said he does not think the SEC will settle with Ripple and agree that XRP sold on exchanges are not securities while the commission still considers ADA, SOL, and MATIC to be investment contracts.\n\n\u201cIs the SEC going to say, \u2018well, let\u2019s come to grips and agree that XRP sold on exchanges is not a security but Cardano is, I don\u2019t see it [happening],\u201d said Attorney Deaton.\n\nRecall that in June, the SEC labeled ADA, SOL, MATIC, and over ten cryptos as securities in its lawsuits against Coinbase.\n\nThe SEC alleged that Coinbase violated U.S. laws by operating an unregistered securities exchange and facilitating the trading of assets deemed as investment contracts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA month later, a federal court in New York issued the highly-anticipated summary judgment in the Ripple case, where it held that XRP in itself is not a security. The court also found that Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales and other distributions are not investment contracts, as alleged by the SEC.\n\nWhile some legal experts speculate that the SEC could appeal the decision after the final judgment, others predict that the regulator could settle with Ripple.\n\nPossible Factor For a Settlement\n\nAttorney Deaton is among the legal experts who do not think a settlement is the next outcome in the lawsuit. Deaton, who believes the SEC is currently in a war against crypto, argued that the commission will only settle with Ripple based on the outcome of its legal tussle with Coinbase.\n\nAccording to Deaton, there could be a settlement in the Ripple case if Coinbase wins its motion to dismiss the SEC charges.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I see causing the settlement is if Coinbase wins their motion to dismiss or partially wins it. That\u2019s the only thing. Otherwise, it\u2019s still a war. We\u2019re in the middle of a war,\u201d said Attorney Deaton.\n\nIf the San Francisco-based exchange wins the litigation, the court will dismiss the SEC\u2019s claim that ADA and a host of other crypto assets are securities.\n\nThis way, it would be easier for the SEC to settle with Ripple and agree that XRP coins traded on exchanges are not securities, according to Deaton\u2019s statement.\n\nFor context, in October, Coinbase filed its final motion to dismiss the charges filed by the SEC, arguing that crypto assets traded on its platform do not constitute investment contracts.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange also argued that the SEC does not have Congress\u2019 blessing to regulate an industry like crypto. The court has yet to issue its decision on the matter. Some legal experts, including Deaton, speculate that the Coinbase ruling might be issued by early next year.\n\nIn the meantime, the Ripple case is still in the remedies stage, with the proceeding scheduled to commence in February. After the court releases the final judgment, the SEC will decide whether it will settle with Ripple or challenge the summary judgment decision in the Second Circuit."
