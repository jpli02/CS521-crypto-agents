        "content": "Advertisement\n\nInternational remittance service provider SBI Remit, part of the SBI Group, has made an exciting announcement regarding its South East Asia operations. According to a blog post, SBI Remit is increasing its reach in the region with the help of Ripple. Both companies, who have been in a long-term partnership, continue their work in building global rails for the future financial system.\n\nIn the announcement, SBI said it would provide cross-border money transfer services to the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. SBI Remit, which has facilitated payments through Ripple since 2017, introduced international money transfers in 2021. Using XRP as a bridge currency between legal tender currencies and a crypto wallet in the Philippines made them the first in Japan to offer this service.\n\nQuick, Low-Cost, and Scalable Transfers\n\nDue to high remittance activity in these countries, RBI is expanding this service to bank accounts in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The goal is to provide quick, low-cost, and scalable international money transfers, strengthening Ripple\u2019s and SBI\u2019s competitiveness in the industry.\n\nSBI Remit will send money transfer requests from customers and will send XRP in response to those requests in real time. SBI partners with Tranglo, another Ripple partner, to enable customers to receive remittances in the local legal tender.\n\nJapan has a long history with XRP and Ripple; only in April 2023 did Japanese banks Yamaguchi, Momiji, and Kitakyushu adopt MoneyTap. The peer-to-peer lending app uses RippleNet and was launched jointly by Ripple and SBI Holdings in 2018. The banks which adopted MoneyTap have several hundred branches in Japan, highlighting the continued expansion of crypto-based services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Adoption Increases, Will Price Follow?\n\nThe move by SBI Remit continues the increasingly bullish narrative for XRP. As the use of XRP and ODL increases, so should demand for XRP. The price expectations, however, have so far come short of what some had hoped for. At the time of writing, XRP trades hands at $0.503, down 18.3% from last month. The price of XRP had taken off after Judge Torres granted Ripple a partial win against the SEC in July. The price went from $0.47 to $0.83 but has since lost most of these gains.\n\nThis comes on the back of uncertainty around the legal proceedings with the SEC when the agency filed a motion for interlocutory appeal. Ripple had filed its opposition with a response by the SEC due Friday, September 8. It should be noted that the SEC is not questioning the status of XRP but rather programmatic and other sales by Ripple and its executives."

        "content": "Wall Street financial expert Linda Jones recently shared with the crypto community how non-accredited investors can buy shares of Ripple before the firm\u2019s eventual public offering.\n\nIn a recent post, Jones noted that Linqto has unveiled a special package for people who could not pass the accredited investor requirement to invest in Ripple stock. The offer is called \u2018Reg D.\u2019 The sole aim is to allow non-accredited investors to acquire Ripple shares pre-IPO.\n\nJones noted it is a limited offering, urging the community to act fast.\n\n#Ad NON-accredited Investors\u2026BIG NEWS! If you want to invest in Ripple stock (private equity) before the IPO but you don't meet the requirements for an Accredited Investor, Linqto has a special offer for you! They put together a Reg D offering which will allow non-accredited\u2026 pic.twitter.com/oePuqXDo0H \u2014 Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) September 8, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNon-accredited Investors Buying Ripple Stock\n\nAccording to the update, the Linqto offering commences next week, particularly on Monday or Wednesday. The intending buyers of Ripple shares are to prepare a minimum investment of $2,500.\n\nThe first step involves registering an account on the Linqto platform. For the next step, Jones stated that intending buyers should move their funds to the Uphold platform and store the amount in US dollars. The minimum amount transferable through Uphold to Linqto is $2,500 a day via debit and credit cards, as well as Apple and Google Pay. The maximum daily limit is $10,000 if you are funding your Uphold via ACH.\n\nAfter the fund movement, Jones stated that Linqto would verify such a user. The third step includes transferring the $2,500 from Uphold into Linqto via the Linqto software.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the essence of sending the fund to Uphold before subsequently sending it to Linqto is to expedite the process of fund confirmation. Interested persons not pleased with such multiple steps can directly send from their bank accounts to Linqto.\n\nHowever, Jones highlighted that the process may take up to three days before the beneficiary\u2019s account is credited.\n\nRegardless, for the fourth step, the interested individuals are to watch the Linqto app or their email for a message on Monday. The last timeline for the email message is Wednesday, September 13.\n\nBy that date, the Ripple stock will be available for acquisition. While the option for wire transfer to Linqto is also available, Jones cautioned that the stock could sell out before the fund confirmation.\n\nNot Financial Advice\n\nMeanwhile, the Wall Street expert disclaimed that the announcement does not constitute financial advice. She urged participants to assess their risk tolerance level properly before proceeding."

        "content": "It\u2019s no longer news that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a formal request for the court\u2019s approval to interlocutory appeal in the ongoing XRP lawsuit.\n\n\n\nThis move has the potential to suspend the proceedings, causing further delays until a final decision is made. The SEC argues that the court\u2019s previous ruling, which stated that XRP retail sales did not constitute an investment contract, holds broader legal implications.\n\nThis request for an appeal contradicts SEC head Gary Gensler\u2019s earlier assertion that the existing regulatory framework for the digital assets industry was adequate. The implications of this development have sparked lively debates within the XRP community.\n\nRead Also: Ripple CTO David Schwartz Clarifies Key Aspects of the SEC Appeal\n\nDelving into the Debates\n\nOne vocal supporter of XRP recently took to social media to indirectly reach out to Marc Fagel, an esteemed figure in securities law enforcement and a former SEC official.\n\nThe supporter questioned the likelihood of the court granting the SEC\u2019s request for an interlocutory appeal, stressing the significance of the case for the entire industry. The supporter presented novel legal aspects and conflicting rulings as factors that should be considered.\n\nI agree with those points, and think they should factor in. However, the specific requirements for interlocutory appeal are hard to meet. I think the odds are against granting the request unless the court looks to the points you raise. \u2014 Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) September 9, 2023\n\nMarc Fagel, when confronted with this query, acknowledged the importance of the factors in question but also shed light on the formidable hurdles faced by interlocutory appeals.\n\nFagel cast doubt on the likelihood of the court approving the SEC\u2019s appeal request unless the concerns raised by the SEC are deemed crucial and compelling by the court. His response adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing discussions surrounding this case.\n\nRead Also: Breaking: Ripple Files Opposition to SEC Appeal Request Over XRP Victory\n\nChallenging the Notion of Triumph\n\nAdding fuel to the debate, another passionate XRP enthusiast entered the conversation, indirectly questioning the novelty of the legal issues involved in the case. This individual suggested that the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions might not be as victorious as they claim. Fagel, however, countered this argument by highlighting the SEC\u2019s track record of success in previous cryptocurrency enforcement actions.\n\nWhile acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead, particularly when dealing with cases involving cryptocurrency exchanges, Fagel cautioned against hasty generalizations. He made it clear that characterizing a mixed ruling in a single case as indicative of an overall losing trend would be an exaggeration.\n\n<\n\nAs the Ripple v. SEC case continues to unfold, the SEC\u2019s recent attempt to appeal the court\u2019s ruling has raised doubts and sparked engaging discussions within the XRP community. With the views of law veteran Marc Fagel adding depth to the conversation, the potential implications of this appeal request are being carefully examined.\n\nWhile uncertainties linger, it is evident that the outcome of this case will have a significant impact on the digital assets industry as a whole.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"

        "title": "Crypto keeps winning in court\u2014but Wall Street may claim the spoils of victory - Fortune",
        "content": "When longtime crypto firm Grayscale beat the SEC before the influential D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last week, it was the industry\u2019s most high-profile legal victory to date. The decision joins two other recent rulings that likely will pave the way for crypto to enter mainstream finance.\n\nThis should be a moment of celebration for Web3 enthusiasts\u2014courts are clearing longstanding legal obstacles to blockchains adding billions of users\u2014but this moment also could prove a crossroads in determining how those users come \u201con chain\u201d\u2014and whether that process will uphold the crypto community\u2019s long-cherished value of decentralization and its benefits, or whether that ideal will be betrayed.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the court rulings themselves, including the recent Grayscale case, which challenged the SEC\u2019s longstanding refusal to grant a spot Bitcoin ETF. While the decision does not command the SEC to approve the ETF, it makes an eventual approval almost a foregone conclusion (though the SEC delaying its decisions on all spot bitcoin ETFs after the Grayscale decision means it will not be immediate). One reason for this is that traditional financial institutions with whom the SEC is likely more comfortable\u2014such as the largest money manager in the world, Blackrock\u2014are also keen to get into the bitcoin-spot-ETF game. As my colleague Peter Fox observed, \u201c[r]etail investors and institutions alike may be attached to bigger names,\u201d and Grayscale might have unwittingly been doing Wall Street\u2019s homework.\n\nWhile the SEC could find ways to keep fighting over spot bitcoin ETF listings, the agency may see a silver lining in admitting defeat here, as that would guarantee the SEC some piece of the regulatory pie. One could even see a world in which spot ETFs for crypto tokens other than BTC and ETH proliferated. While that may be a big win for the institutions issuing and managing those funds, a world in which retail traders primarily access these tokens through such funds\u2014rather than holding, trading, and using them directly through user-controlled digital wallets\u2014would be a huge waste of potential, stifling innovative business models the technology enables.\n\nThe recent order in the Ripple case in the Southern District of New York represents another big symbolic victory for the industry after the scandals and market funk of the last year. I wrote about this at greater length earlier with my colleagues, but, for present purposes, the important thing to note is the order does not establish a precedent (or win the case for Ripple). So the order\u2019s knock-on effects are likely limited, and while it does supply the industry with ample ammunition in the form of legal arguments to bolster various use cases and business models, the order\u2019s real impact could be as fleeting as Terra scammer Do Kwon\u2019s 15 minutes of fame.\n\nThen there is the Uniswap case. Although not an SEC-related decision action, and the least high-profile of the three cases examined here, the recent dismissal of a class-action against Uniswap is likely to prove influential in the long term. The case itself involved claims by putative \u201cinvestors\u201d that Uniswap, its CEO, and its biggest venture capital backers were liable for scammy tokens sold by unknown actors who were using the firm\u2019s decentralized protocol.\n\nShowing a deft understanding of the function of the decentralized technology at issue, Judge Polk Failla of SDNY found, with respect to liability under the Exchange Act, that \u201cthird-party human intervention caused the harm, not the underlying platform.\u201d Developers writing smart contracts are not entering into a legal contract with any user of such smart contract, she wrote, and so \u201cit defies logic that a drafter of computer code underlying a particular software platform could be liable\u201d for another person\u2019s misuse of the platform.\n\nThat decision lets us observe a court that understands the technology, the gaps in the law, and the various arguments about how and why particular rules from the federal securities laws should\u2014or should not\u2014apply. The court also concedes that the state of industry regulation is in flux, but the best ammunition for the industry is language supporting the proposition that writing code underlying a smart contract does not a financial institution make. Not holding people liable for what bad actors do with their publicly published computer code is a good result.\n\nThis important victory may prove only pyrrhic, though, if important legal issues (e.g. token security status) are not resolved in a more comprehensive and systemic fashion. Disputes settled in court seldom make the best policy. And while Wall Street can bring liquidity, know-how, and legitimacy to crypto, entrepreneurs must be allowed to experiment with business models unlocked by the technology.\n\nOtherwise, this mainstream moment will be a missed opportunity. Rather than a billion users holding and trading NFTs, yield farming through DeFi, and storing files on decentralized protocols like Filecoin, mainstream crypto could mean Wall Street offering financial products that integrate crypto, relegating blockchains to the backend. Rather than decentralized protocols empowering users through digital ownership, could Mainstream Crypto merely become the establishment usurping the entrepreneurs\u2014Wall Street eating Silicon Valley\u2019s breakfast? I hope not, but the actions of entrepreneurs, the courts, and policymakers in the near future will answer that question.\n\nDamien G. Scott is an attorney at Scoolidge, Peters, Russotti & Fox LLP.
