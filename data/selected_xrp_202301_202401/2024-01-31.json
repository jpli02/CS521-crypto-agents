        "content": "Chris Larsen, the executive chairman of San Francisco-based payments firm Ripple Labs, has been hacked, resulting in the theft of 213 million XRP tokens.\n\nThe cyberattack, which targeted Larsen\u2019s holdings, has led to a loss estimated at around US$112 million.\n\nAccording to ZachXBT, an online blockchain sleuth who first reported the hack on X (formerly Twitter), the stolen funds have been \u201claundered\u201d through cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Kraken and OKX.\n\n\u201cYesterday, there was unauthorized access to a few of my personal XRP accounts (not @Ripple ) \u2013 we were quickly able to catch the problem and notify exchanges to freeze the affected addresses. Law enforcement is already involved,\u201d said Larsen.\n\nLarsen added that the hack was an isolated incident and Ripple\u2019s wallets are secure.\n\nXRP, the cryptocurrency that Ripple Labs builds its payment products around, had a steep drop of around 5% following the incident. It traded at US$0.5114 at 2:00 p.m. ET, according to CoinGecko data."

The stolen funds were subsequently laundered through multiple exchanges. This caused some to question why Larsen did not inform the public of the incident, and only made the announcement after ZachXBT\u2019s tweets.

Ripple Labs, the company behind the network, utilizes XRP to power tools like RippleNet, its cross-border payments platform designed for financial institutions. In 2020, Ripple Labs achieved a significant victory over the SEC over XRP\u2019s classification as a security."
