The global standard for cross-border payment flows is steadily evolving to ISO 20022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is interesting to note that Ripple has taken the lead in this transition, having built its RippleNet network with the ISO 20022 standards in mind from the beginning.\n\nExciting era for cross-border payments as #ISO20022 standard is globally introduced in Mar. 2023. @BNYMellon's Isabel Schmidt shares benefits for banks and customers with Swift's Stephen Lindsay at @Sibos. Read more in @Euromoney: https://t.co/rpOF3hswSy #payments #crossborder \u2014 Swift (@swiftcommunity) February 16, 2023\n\n2020 saw Ripple become the first member focused on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to join the ISO 20022 Registration Management Group (RMG) standards organization.\n\nThe use of ISO 20022 for international payments has only recently begun to expand. As a result, Ripple and its RippleNet customers were early adopters of ISO 20022 for cross-border payments.\n\nRipple's focus: utility\n\nRipple emphasized its focus on real-world utility, which includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and sustainability at the beginning of 2023. It claims that a focus on real-world applications will help propel the coming age of CBDCs.\n\nIn this light, Ripple anticipates the launch of new CBDC pilot programs around the world and has thus prepared. James Wallis, VP of central bank engagements, predicts an emphasis on interoperable CBDC solutions that enhance cross-border payments.\n\nRipple's shift to utility extends to NFTs, with a second wave of NFTs exploring real-world use cases, such as real estate and carbon markets in the works.\n\nCrypto's real-world utility also extends to sustainability-oriented initiatives, as blockchain and cryptocurrency are seen as playing a bigger role in the effort to combat climate change."

        "title": "Ripples from the Dunes: Playing Possum\u2026 Opossum? - seehafernews.com",
        "content": "Photo from the University of Texas Biodiversity Center\n\nEver since I was little, I have always loved possums! Or, opossums\u2026 well we will discuss that later. There are even several photographs of me as a toddler chasing after an opossum in our forested backyard trying to befriend the cute creature. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I never did manage to befriend them. As I grew older and learned more about them, I have grown to love them even more, as they are so interesting!\n\nOpossum or possum? Excellent question. Both terms are used when referring to the Virginia Opossum (native to Wisconsin). The word \u201copossum\u201d comes from the Algonquian word \u201capasam\u201d meaning \u201cwhite animal\u201d. Early settlers referred to the creatures as \u201copossum\u201d\u2026 however, through a process called aphesis (the loss of a short unaccented vowel at the beginning of the word) the \u201cO\u201d was dropped giving way to the term \u201cpossum\u201d. This is pretty confusing, especially given that possums are completely different animals than opossums. Possums are marsupial animals native to Australia, New Zealand, and China whereas the opossum is a marsupial animal native to America and southern Canada. Textbooks and scientific writings favor the usage of \u201copossum\u201d whereas general speech has \u201cpossum\u201d being more common. I grew up saying \u201cpossum\u201d but now use the two interchangeably. how confusing..\n\nRegardless of what you call it, the Virginia Opossum (Didelphis virginiana) can be found throughout most of Wisconsin. They have adapted to live close to humans, and their adaptability has allowed them to survive for millions of years!\n\nThey are the United States ONLY marsupial mammal, how neat! Baby opossums will stay in their mother\u2019s pouch for around 2 months before they climb out onto their mother\u2019s back for the cutest piggyback ride you will ever see! They have little hands that look similar to ours, they even have an opposable digit on their back feet similar to our thumbs called a hallux. Their fur-less hands are adapted to grab and hold onto things, perfect for helping them to climb. Speaking of climbing adaptations, they use their tails to help them climb and balance as well. They even use their tail to help carry bedding materials to their den!\n\nOpossums are omnivores and are adept at scavenging for food\u2026 they will eat almost anything! They also have the most teeth out of any North American mammal, a whopping 50!\n\nOne thing that comes to people\u2019s minds when they think of opossums is the saying \u201cplaying possum\u201d\u2026 which is true! They really do fake their death when they are frightened. This behavior is involuntary, not a conscious choice made by the animal. They will fall onto their side, eyes open, drool, and emit a foul-smelling musk to deter predators. They can stay motionless like this for minutes to even hours until they start to wake up, beginning with a twitch of their ears.\n\nHere at Woodland Dunes, we see opossums on our trail cameras throughout the preserve, both near the nature center and out in the State Natural Area. Whether or not you agree about them being the cutest animals ever, they are very important parts of our ecosystem. They are food for other animals, eat things we deem as pests, and clean up rotting foods and dead animals too. And they are our only native marsupial mammal, so that is pretty neat! Younger me would\u2019ve been ecstatic to get to share all of this \u201cpossum\u201d information with others, and hopefully it inspired you to see them as the unique and interesting creatures that they are too."

        "title": "The Montech Titan Gold 1200W PSU Review: A Capable Contender for the ATX 3.0 Club - AnandTech",
        "content": "Power Supply Quality\n\nAs part of our testing, we also check output parameters are within specifications, as well as voltage ripple and line noise.\n\nMain Output Load (Watts) 241.83 W 602.35 W 899.2 W 1197.61 W Load (Percent) 20.15% 50.2% 74.93% 99.8% Amperes Volts Amperes Volts Amperes Volts Amperes Volts 3.3 V 2.04 3.37 5.11 3.36 7.67 3.34 10.22 3.33 5 V 2.04 5.09 5.11 5.05 7.67 5.03 10.22 5.01 12 V 18.59 12.08 46.46 12.04 69.7 11.98 92.93 11.97\n\nLine Regulation\n\n(20% to 100% load) Voltage Ripple (mV) 20% Load 50% Load 75% Load 100% Load CL1\n\n12V CL2\n\n3.3V + 5V 3.3V 1.4% 10 12 14 16 12 14 5V 1.55% 10 12 16 16 14 14 12V 0.9% 12 16 16 26 28 22\n\nThe power quality of the Titan Montech Gold 1200W PSU is excellent for a product of this price range and of that efficiency certification. It has exceptional filtering on all voltage lines and a regulation lower than 1% on the primary 12V line. The maximum ripple on the 12V line is just 26 mV, a spectacular figure for a 1200W PSU. Montech also implemented exceptional filtering on the 3.3V/5V lines as well, where we recorded a maximum ripple of just 16 mV.\n\nAs part of our standard testing, we test the primary protections of all PSUs we review (Over Current, Over Voltage, Over Power, and Short Circuit). We tested all of the protections of the Montech Titan Gold 1200W PSU and they all operate as intended. However, as seems to be the trend with ATX 3.0 units that are upgrades/updates of older platforms, both the OCP and OPP protections of the unit seem to be set very high. The OCP protection of the 12V rail kicked in instantly, as intended, when the current was almost 35% above the unit\u2019s maximum rating. Likewise, we could draw almost 200 Watts above its rated capacity for relatively long time periods before the unit\u2019s OPP protection decided it should shut the unit down. All quality PSUs are designed with overheads for the OPP/OCP protections but we suspect that these very high figures are the side effect of gaining ATX 3.0 compliance, as the engineers have to ensure that the PSU will not be shutting down due to short-term power excursions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Titan Gold 1200W marks a significant milestone for Montech, as it is their first entry into the ATX 3.0 market and one of the first units to be released under this new standard. With a focus on delivering a good price-to-performance ratio, the Montech Titan Gold 1200W aspires to be a top contender in the crowded power supply market.\n\nThe Montech Titan Gold 1200W is a high-performance computer power supply that delivers excellent power quality with very low voltage ripple and good regulation. This power supply is highly efficient, especially at lower loads, but its performance drops slightly at higher loads. The build quality of this power supply is exceptional, featuring Japanese capacitors and construction by a reputable OEM. Additionally, the competitive retail price of the Montech Titan Gold 1200W makes it a great value for those in need of a powerful and reliable power supply.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the power supply can get thermally stressed if it is kept running heavily loaded for prolonged periods of time, which must be considered for some applications. Home users and gamers need not worry about this, as regular PCs will not be running at maximum capacity for considerable periods. However, it will also generate very high noise levels if heavily loaded, which can be a potential drawback for some users.\n\nIn conclusion, the Montech Titan Gold 1200W power supply is a good, cost-effective option for high-end gaming and workstation builds. Its 1200W output makes it a great choice for all but the most power-hungry of systems, more than easily accommodating a GeForce RTX 4090 and overclocked CPU, and the 80 Plus Gold certification assures good efficiency and passable thermal losses. The build quality is solid and the unit is well designed, and the 12VHPWR connector ensures its compatibility and usefulness going forward. The only downside is the noise level under heavy loads which might be an issue for some users. However, for those who are looking for a top-performing power supply, the Montech Titan Gold 1200W is a great option, and its $220 retail price makes it highly competitive in the market."

        "title": "Feedback loops make climate action even more urgent, scientists say - Oregon State University",
        "content": "CORVALLIS, Ore. \u2013 An international collaboration led by Oregon State University scientists has identified 27 global warming accelerators known as amplifying feedback loops, including some that the researchers say may not be fully accounted for in climate models.\n\nThey note that the findings, published today in the journal One Earth, add urgency to the need to respond to the climate crisis and provide a roadmap for policymakers aiming to avert the most severe consequences of a warming planet.\n\nIn climate science, amplifying feedback loops are situations where a climate-caused alteration can trigger a process that causes even more warming, which in turn intensifies the alteration. An example would be warming in the Arctic, leading to melting sea ice, which results in further warming because sea water absorbs rather than reflects solar radiation.\n\nOSU College of Forestry postdoctoral scholar Christopher Wolf and distinguished professor William Ripple led the study, which in all looked at 41 climate change feedbacks.\n\n\u201cMany of the feedback loops we examined significantly increase warming because of their connection to greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cTo the best of our knowledge, this is the most extensive list available of climate feedback loops, and not all of them are fully considered in climate models. What\u2019s urgently needed is more research and modeling and an accelerated cutback of emissions.\u201d\n\nThe paper makes two calls to action for \u201cimmediate and massive\u201d emissions reductions:\n\nMinimize short-term warming given that \u201cclimate disasters\u201d in the form of wildfires, coastal flooding, permafrost thaw, intense storms and other extreme weather are already occurring.\n\nMitigate the possible major threats looming from climate tipping points that are drawing ever-closer due to the prevalence of the many amplifying feedback loops. A tipping point is a threshold after which a change in a component of the climate system becomes self-perpetuating.\n\n\u201cTransformative, socially just changes in global energy and transportation, short-lived air pollution, food production, nature preservation and the international economy, together with population policies based on education and equality, are needed to meet these challenges in both the short and long term,\u201d Ripple said. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to fully prevent the pain of climate change, but if we take meaningful steps soon while prioritizing human basic needs and social justice, it could still be possible to limit the harm.\u201d\n\nRipple, Wolf and co-authors from the University of Exeter, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the Woodwell Climate Research Center and Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Associates considered both biological and physical feedbacks. Biological feedbacks include forest dieback, soil carbon loss and wildfire; physical feedbacks involve changes such as reduced snow cover, increased Antarctic rainfall and shrinking arctic sea ice.\n\nEven comparatively modest warming is expected to heighten the likelihood that the Earth will cross various tipping points, the researchers say, causing big changes in the planet\u2019s climate system and potentially strengthening the amplifying feedbacks.\n\n\u201cClimate models may be underestimating the acceleration in global temperature change because they aren\u2019t fully considering this large and related set of amplifying feedback loops,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThe accuracy of climate models is crucial as they help guide mitigation efforts by telling policymakers about the expected effects of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. While recent climate models do a much better job of incorporating diverse feedback loops, more progress is needed.\u201d\n\nEmissions have risen substantially over the last century, the researchers note, despite several decades of warnings that they should be significantly curbed. The scientists say interactions among feedback loops could cause a permanent shift away from the Earth\u2019s current climate state to one that threatens the survival of many humans and other life forms.\n\n\u201cIn the worst case, if amplifying feedbacks are strong enough, the result is likely tragic climate change that\u2019s moved beyond anything humans can control,\u201d Ripple said. \u201cWe need a rapid transition toward integrated Earth system science because the climate can only be fully understood by considering the functioning and state of all Earth systems together. This will require large-scale collaboration, and the result would provide better information for policymakers.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the 27 amplifying climate feedbacks the scientists studied were seven that are characterized as dampening \u2013 they act to stabilize the climate system. An example is carbon dioxide fertilization, where rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 lead to increasing carbon uptake by vegetation.\n\nThe effects of the remaining seven feedbacks, including increased atmospheric dust and reduced ocean stability, are not yet known.\n\nThe paper in One Earth has a corresponding website that features more about climate feedback loops, including infographics and interactive animations."

        "title": "The ripple effects of Georgia's public defender shortage - GPB News",
        "content": "A shortage of public defenders in Georgia is leaving attorneys overburdened and those accused of crimes waiting for a proper defense \u2014 and that wait can last for months. The problem has been long in the making and will take longer to solve. For a look at the extent of the problem, we turn now to Jason Sheffield. He's the former president and current board member of the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. He spoke with GPB's Peter Biello.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nPeter Biello: Let's start by unpacking who is harmed by a shortage like this. First off: the defendants. What happens when someone's accused of a crime and needs a public defender but either has trouble getting one or the \u2014 the public defender assigned to them has too many clients and maybe not enough time to focus on them?\n\nJason Sheffield: The person accused is absolutely at the first level of harm that we're experiencing statewide in the public defender system. But there's more than that. There's the judges who are harmed, and there's the system itself. If you think about, starting with the people who are accused, these are individuals who are indigent. When you are accused of a crime, the state brings all of their power, all of their investigative power, all of their authority against you. And it triggers certain rights for these people who are accused. To have someone be there when you're questioned, to have someone assist you when you're trying to get out of jail on bond, to have someone explain the charges to you \u2014 these are the basic fundamental rights that are being denied because the system's in crisis.\n\nPeter Biello: You mentioned judges are harmed by this. Can you tell us how?\n\nJason Sheffield: A judge wants to do the right thing. Where you don't have adequate representation for persons accused of a crime who are indigent, the judges hear nothing from the other side, and the judges begin to wonder, \"Am I getting the full story? Am I hearing the full truth?\" Judges cannot make informed decisions without the help and assistance of a criminal defense lawyer.\n\nPeter Biello: What resources do public defenders need now that perhaps they used to have but don't anymore?\n\nJason Sheffield: Being a public defender is a very challenging job for many reasons. It requires that you devote your time to people who don't have the resources to give you, as an attorney, to help in their defense. So you are totally reliant on the state, the Georgia Public Defender Council (GPDC) and/or the county to provide you with the resources so that you can do a good job. And what a good job looks like in the world of criminal defense is: an investigator, an office with printers and paper. Historically speaking, GPDC has partnered with the state and has partnered with the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to always do their best to fund and to educate these public defenders across the state. But something changed that so fundamentally undermined the efforts of public defenders that they began to feel unappreciated, unsupported, and then their offices were taken away. Then their printers were taken away. And paper was taken away. The camaraderie disappeared and people started to feel like they didn't have a home to build their case within to protect these people accused.\n\nPeter Biello: And you're talking about public defenders across the state?\n\nJason Sheffield: I'm talking about public defenders across the state that have been financially supported by GPDC. Under new leadership, they started having things taken away, in a way that appeared to be politically motivated.\n\nPeter Biello: Well, let me ask you, what political constituency would be pleased by that? Why is that a good thing for some people?\n\nJason Sheffield: Obviously, we're always concerned in Georgia about our budget. We're always concerned about programs, were concerned about protecting citizens. But there can be no more fundamental protection than a citizen's right and access to the courts and to an attorney. And so when you have the governor encouraging cuts and you have the director then making those cuts to an organization that is already underfunded, you begin to chip away at the spirit of the people who provide protections for indigent persons statewide.\n\nPeter Biello: Lawmakers have discussed pay raises for some in the public defender world. Would that help?\n\nJason Sheffield: The current issue in Georgia's public defense system is that there aren't enough public defenders because they feel abused by the agency, the state agency that's traditionally supported them and help them. We would like to have our office back. We'd like to have a printer. We'd like to be able to work together and not from home. We would like our appellate division to not be decimated. Now that appellate division is back, but the appellate division was dismantled. And several lawyers who specialize in the type of issues that trial lawyers need to know as they're heading into trial \u2014 those lawyers were terminated. So you didn't have the backup. You didn't have the kind of information that was available before. It's as if the state agency expected a bridge to stay solid, but took away the pillars from underneath the bridge one by one and is surprised when that bridge collapses.\n\nPeter Biello: For people accused of crimes and waiting so long for defense to become available \u2014 proper defense to become available \u2014 is there a short-term solution so that these people aren't waiting in jail for so long, like bringing lawyers out of retirement to quickly help address the issue, or something else I'm not thinking of? What do you think?\n\nJason Sheffield: The solution seems to be to start with the state and for the state to acknowledge \u2014 and by the state I mean GPDC \u2014 to acknowledge that they need to be properly funded and they need to lobby the Legislature for appropriate funding. If you look at, as an example, what's happened most recently with the ARPA funds, the rescue funds that had been given to Georgia in the tune of about $100 million \u2014 maybe a little bit more than that \u2014 85 to 90% of that was given to prosecutors and judges. The rest of it was given to public defenders. So now prosecutors have more people to prosecute crimes. They have more victim advocates to assist with the victim issues in the case. And judges are ready to try cases. But it's like an entire lane of cars ready to start in the Indy 500 and none of them have tires. The tires, of course, are the public defenders that you need to make the system move forward \u2014 the cases move forward. Why did they only get a small percentage of those funds? I don't know. But that just shows an imbalance in the type of thinking that has become systemic in our Legislature and in our state funding agencies.\n\nNote: We reached out to Omotayo Alli, the Executive Director of the Georgia Public Defender Council. Through a spokesman she declined our request. But the Georgia Public Defender Council did send a statement, part of which reads as follows: \"Pre-2020, GPDC regularly furloughed attorneys statewide for weeks each year to maintain its budget. In 2020, the agency relocated to state-owned office space rather than furloughing attorneys, and there have been zero furloughs since Executive Director Alli\u2019s appointment. We understand GACDL may be unhappy with GPDC as circumstances require us to bring training and professional development in-house and reinvest in our own capacity rather than contracting with private groups.\""
