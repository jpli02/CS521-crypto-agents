        "title": "Ripple Labs Plans $285 Million Share Buyback: Report - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "The company behind the XRP token reportedly plans to buy back $285 million worth of shares, valuing the firm at $11 billion.\n\nRipple Labs, the company behind the XRP token, appears to have offered its early investors an alternative exit strategy in the form of a share buyback.\n\nAccording to a Wednesday report from Reuters, citing two sources familiar with the matter, the company plans to buy back $285 million worth of shares from early investors and employees.\n\nThe tender offer would value the company at $11.3 billion, and investors would be allowed to sell a maximum of 6% of their stake in the firm.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Ripple has engaged in a share buyback \u2013 the company repurchased shares in January 2022 after it secured a $200 million funding round. At the time of that buyback, Ripple was valued at $15 billion.\n\nRipple later confirmed the tender offer to Reuters, adding that the firm plans to spend $500 million in the proposed buyback to cover the costs of converting restricted stock units into shares and taxes.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also told the publication that the firm plans to do more share buybacks on a regular basis as a means to provide liquidity for investors, but has no plans for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) given the \u201cregulatory uncertainty\u201d in the U.S.\n\nFor the better part of two years, Ripple was engaged in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the regulator claiming that the firm had offered unregistered securities from the sale of XRP tokens.\n\nIn July 2023, a U.S. District Judge granted Ripple a partial victory, ruling that the sale of XRP on exchanges and other platforms did not constitute investment contracts.\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.60, gaining 5.8% over the last 24 hours, joining a host of altcoins that rallied after the SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier today."

        "title": "Ripple to be valued at US$11.3 bln following share repurchase - Forkast News",
        "content": "Ripple Labs, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency payments firm, will reportedly repurchase US$285 million of its shares, effectively valuing the company at US$11.3 billion.\n\nThe buyback initiative, which is aimed at early investors and employees, will allow them to sell up to 6% of their holdings, according to sources close to the matter cited by Reuters. This move comes as Ripple continues to navigate the complexities of the U.S. regulatory environment, with no immediate plans for a public offering.\n\nThe repurchase is part of a broader US$500 million buyback plan that includes costs associated with converting restricted stock units into common shares and related taxes. Ripple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse reportedly confirmed the tender offer and highlighted the company\u2019s strong financial position, with over US$1 billion in cash and more than US$25 billion in crypto assets, predominantly in XRP. The decision to buy back shares rather than pursue an initial public offering (IPO) provides liquidity to investors while maintaining greater control over the company\u2019s operations.\n\nIn December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and its executives for conducting unregistered securities offerings through the sale of XRP. However, a recent court ruling deemed that XRP sales on public exchanges did not constitute unregistered securities offerings, marking a partial victory for Ripple.\n\nThe significance of Ripple\u2019s share buyback lies in its alternative approach to providing investor exits. By opting for a tender offer instead of an IPO, Ripple avoids the additional scrutiny, market fluctuations, and investor expectations that come with going public.\n\nRipple\u2019s commitment to its payment protocol, which facilitates cross-border transactions and promotes the use of XRP, remains strong despite regulatory challenges. The company recently acquired the Switzerland-based crypto custody firm Metaco for US$250 million.\n\nXRP is the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization of approximately US$31 billion.\n\nXRP rose 1% to US$0.5759 in the last 24 hours, as of 4:00 p.m. ET, according to CoinGecko data."

        "title": "SEC wants Ripple to share financial statements and contracts to determine remedies - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said in a Jan. 11 filing that it aims to have Ripple provide certain documents in an ongoing legal case.\n\nSpecifically, the securities regulator requested a court order compelling Ripple Labs, Inc. to produce financial statements for 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe SEC also asked for Ripple to be compelled to produce contracts governing institutional sales of XRP from after the SEC\u2019s original complaint. It noted that Judge Analisa Torres previously identified institutional sales as unregistered securities sales and offerings within the pre-complaint period.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC said that it seeks to have Ripple answer a single interrogatory (that is, a formally written question) about the amount of proceeds that it received from institutional sales after the filing of the SEC\u2019s complaint, but for contracts that it entered into before the complaint.\n\nThe SEC said that those two types of documents and the interrogatory will help Judge Torres determine whether the court should impose relief, including injunctions and civil penalties, as well as the amount of civil penalties that may be applied.\n\nRipple argues that it should not face injunctions because its future XRP sales are exempt from registration and securities laws. The SEC countered this by asserting that the the financial information it has requested is \u201cfundamental to tailoring a penalty to deter future violations.\u201d\n\nSEC v. Ripple has largely concluded\n\nThe SEC originally alleged that Ripple\u2019s sales of XRP constituted unregistered securities offerings in December 2020. Ripple gained a partial victory in July 2023 when Judge Torres ruled that certain sales (including programmatic and exchange sales) were not securities offerings. However, Judge Torres also ruled that Ripple\u2019s institutional sales were securities offerings, favoring the SEC.\n\nThe dispute was resolved in October 2023 as the SEC dropped charges against two Ripple executives. The case largely concluded in December 2023 as Judge Torres issued a summary judgment on certain remaining matters.\n\nDespite the recency of the SEC\u2019s decision to request new information, previous reports noted that the court could impose penalties on Ripple.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Is Ripple's share buyback positive or negative? - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Yesterday Reuters reported that Ripple Labs is buying back $285 million worth of stock from early investors and employees, citing sources. The tender offer allows owners to sell up to 6% of their stake, valuing the company at $11.3 billion.\n\nRipple confirmed the buyback to Reuters with CEO Brad Garlinghouse stating that Ripple has $1 billion in cash and $25 billion in crypto, mostly XRP. He also confirmed there are no plans for an IPO any time soon because of U.S. regulatory uncertainty.\n\nIt is exceptionally unusual for a pre-IPO company to buy back its own shares. However, Ripple isn\u2019t just any company. Few startups hold the quantity of assets that Ripple has.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen Ripple\u2019s balance sheet, but based on simple math, a valuation of $11.3 billion seems to represent around 44% of Ripple\u2019s cash and crypto. And one would hope that Ripple\u2019s intellectual property might be worth something.\n\nIs Ripple\u2019s XRP worth $25 billion?\n\nBut that calculation isn\u2019t entirely accurate because valuing an escrowed stash of coins at the current market price is risky. According to Coingecko, the currently circulating XRP supply is 54.2 billion tokens out of a maximum of 100 billion. So Ripple has the balance of 45.8 billion tokens valued at yesterday\u2019s price of 55 cents, which is around $25.2 billion. Using that figure is natural because that\u2019s the available market price.\n\nHowever, if Ripple released those tokens onto the market today, the price would drop significantly. Of course, it won\u2019t do that because it has its escrow process. However, an investor using the current price to value locked-up tokens is FTX-risky, particularly when it\u2019s such a large proportion of the total issuance.\n\nSo, an $11.3 billion valuation isn\u2019t really a 56% discount.\n\nThat said, buying back stock is generally a vote of confidence by the company and its leaders. One could imagine CEO Garlinghouse saying, \u201cWe can buy you out at a big discount. We\u2019ll take that!\u201d\n\nThe fact that Ripple is in a position to do this is positive. Compared to its cash and XRP balance, $285 million is not huge.\n\nWhy investors might want an exit\n\nOne potential reason for investors exiting is the long time that has passed since Ripple\u2019s early funding rounds between 2013 and 2016. Some venture funds might simply want an exit to secure their massive profits. Given an IPO was on the cards before the SEC litigation and no longer is, it might be the simplest explanation is the right one. The list of external investors is at the foot of this article.\n\nOther investors may believe that Ripple will have to pay substantial penalties to the SEC.\n\nRecall that Ripple only prevailed in part of its battle with the SEC. Judge Torres ruled in Ripple\u2019s favor that anonymous XRP sales via exchanges to retail investors were not sales of securities. However, the judge found for the SEC regarding institutional sales. Those institutional sales totaled $1.3 billion when the case was filed and another $3 billion subsequently.\n\nIf Ripple has $1 billion in cash, it might need to sell more XRP to pay damages, depending on the penalty figure.\n\nInvestors might think this will put pressure on the value of XRP. Alternatively, over the longer term, perhaps they believe the value of XRP will be lower by the time Ripple sells its XRP stash.\n\nWhat\u2019s Ripple\u2019s motivation?\n\nA key issue is we don\u2019t know why Ripple wants to buy back stock. There may be a lot of stock overhang because some investors want to exit. That could be pushing down Ripple\u2019s stock valuation on secondary markets for private stocks such as Forge Global. Hence, this could be an exercise to prop up its stock price. That\u2019s not dissimilar to Ripple\u2019s actions in putting unlocked XRP back into escrow. News of a low stock price could impact XRP\u2019s price and result in a vicious circle.\n\nAfter all, the $11.3 billion valuation isn\u2019t much higher than the $10 billion Series C valuation in December 2019. That was before the last crypto boom, and XRP was valued at around 20 cents then.\n\nThe most interesting piece of information will be which investors choose to sell.\n\nAs an aside, this is not the first time that Ripple has bought back stock. In early 2022 it repurchased its Series C $200 million funding, which originally valued the business at $10 billion. For the repurchase Ripple used a valuation of $15 billion. The company had a nasty falling out with lead Series C investor Tetragon, who wanted out after the SEC sued Ripple. A clause in the contract said a determination that XRP was a security would trigger a buyback.\n\nJudging by the XRP price action, the buyback seems generally regarded as good news.\n\nEarly Ripple investors"
