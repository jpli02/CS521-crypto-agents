        "content": "Ripple President Monica Long has shared her take on how crypto and blockchain technology will change commerce and consumer behavior in 2024 and beyond.\n\nMonica Long featured in the New York Times\u2019 special series on how macroeconomic factors can impact consumer behaviors in the coming years. As an advocate of blockchain, Monica posits that the global economy is changing in the financial world, as current infrastructure cannot power a dynamic marketplace.\n\nMonica Long on Crypto Takeover\n\nTo solidify her thesis, the Ripple President pointed out the ongoing \u201cCryptoization\u201d of many developing economies.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWith macroeconomic instability and high inflation ravaging many developing countries, some citizens in countries like Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and Argentina have had to embrace cryptocurrencies in place of their weakening fiat currencies.\n\nMonica highlighted how these crypto and stablecoins are helping to power savings and retail purchases, a trend that shows how the fast-evolving digital world cannot rely on the slow settlement and high-cost infrastructures that most financial institutions are still using to date.\n\nThe Ripple executive said that blockchain technology and crypto have the tendency to make the financial ecosystem internet native. This feature will not just be accessible to everyone, it will be cheaper compared to existing alternatives.\n\nWith commerce cited as one of the key industries that will benefit from the ongoing crypto takeover, Monica Long said the financial landscape, dominated by a few mega-banks, can no longer serve the needs of a digital-first world.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRipple Labs Piloting the Move\n\nWith different innovative solutions ranging from RippleNet to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), Ripple is bringing seamless payments that can truly power the ongoing financial revolution. The company is inking the right partnerships to achieve this goal.\n\nBesides its retail and consumer leaning, Ripple is also aligning its focus for the future with its role in helping some partner countries in their Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pursuit."

        "content": "WEB3\n\nThe document addresses key challenges hindering CBDC adoption, including regulatory issues, consumer education, interoperability, digital identity verification, offline transaction access, and privacy concerns.\n\nRipple has taken a proactive stance on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), unveiling a comprehensive whitepaper that digs into the potential advantages and challenges associated with these digital forms of national currencies.\n\nThe 23-page document confronts critical hurdles impeding the widespread adoption of CBDCs. Ripple identifies challenges such as the absence of a unified regulatory framework, limited consumer education, interoperability issues among CBDCs, digital identity verification concerns, offline transaction access, and apprehensions regarding privacy and security.\n\nDespite acknowledging these hurdles, Ripple expresses confidence that these challenges are not insurmountable.\n\n\u200d\n\nRipple's Active Role in CBDC Development\n\nRipple underlines its commitment to the CBDC cause by actively engaging with central banks globally. The whitepaper reveals ongoing collaborations with central banks in Hong Kong, Palau, Colombia, Montenegro, Bhutan, and more than 20 others. Ripple sees CBDCs as catalysts for expanding financial inclusion, strengthening policy control, and streamlining cross-border payments.\n\nThe paper concludes on a positive note, projecting that CBDCs are expected to circulate $5 trillion during the next decade through major economies. Ripple views CBDCs as a transformative force in providing cost-effective financial services.\n\nJames Wallis, Ripple's Vice President, previously expressed optimism, stating that CBDCs offer streamlined payment options and credit establishment opportunities, even for individuals without prior connections to traditional financial institutions.\n\nRipple was founded in 2012 by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen and offers a digital payment protocol tailored for financial institutions. Its native token, XRP, serves as a mediator for value transfers across RippleNet and is at the core of Ripple's operations. XRP is trading at $0.6266, down 4% in the last seven days, as of writing,"

Local currencies are rapidly losing value, resulting in increased acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nLong adds that this trend underlies the simple fact that the current financial infrastructure may be too \"fractured, slow and expensive to serve growing global commerce.\"\n\nHowever, this is poised to change with the rise of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Long believes that financial rails may and will become internet-native, offering greater accessibility and affordability to financial services for everyone.\n\nAccording to the Ripple president, the continuous shift from analog to digital-first in the realm of financial infrastructure has the potential to profoundly revolutionize how commerce is conducted.\n\nRipple has long stated its intention to revolutionize the future of finance. The first phase of the Ripple Palau Stablecoin Program, as reported, was a big success, as volunteers and retailers were optimistic about the value proposition presented by the Palau stablecoin (PSC) as a digital payment system."

        "title": "Is the Retail Crime Wave a Tsunami or a Ripple? - Retail TouchPoints",
        "content": "With our Editors Perspectives columns, you\u2019ll get insights and opinions from the Retail TouchPoints editorial team as they dig into the latest trends in retail, marketing and tech.\n\nBack in 2022, the message was clear \u2014 retail crime was on the rise: \u201cThere\u2019s no two ways about it,\u201d said Gautham Vadakkepatt, Director of the Center for Retail Transformation at the George Mason University School of Business in an interview with Retail TouchPoints. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to several retailers and it\u2019s a major issue that all the big retailers are dealing with.\u201d\n\nPossible culprits (beyond the thieves themselves) were the supply chain challenges the industry was still dealing with at the time, inflation driving up the cost of goods and even the lingering use of masks following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt all sounded plausible, and the prevailing view \u2014 that retail crime was on a rampage \u2014 was backed up by the National Retail Federation\u2019s April 2023 Organized Retail Crime (ORC) report, which stated that \u201cnearly half\u201d of the $94.5 billion in 2021 retail shrink could be attributed to ORC. The perception gained even more support as Lowe\u2019s, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Target all blamed ORC for negatively affecting their financial results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScary stuff \u2014 just the words \u201corganized crime\u201d conjure up visions of Tony Soprano and his cronies plotting murder, extortion and other illegal activities at the Bada Bing! And there was certainly some reality to it: the Retail TouchPoints 2023 Store Operations Benchmark Survey of retailers themselves revealed that \u201creducing theft/shrink\u201d was a top store-level workforce management challenge for 46% of respondents, second only to the 53% citing employee training and empowerment.\n\nThere was only one little problem: the NRF\u2019s startling statistic was arrived at by conflating survey data with Senate testimony. The statement about organized retail crime\u2019s impact on shrink was an inference made by the analyst from K2 [the risk advisory firm that assisted with the report] linking the results of a 2021 NRF crime survey with previous Senate testimony by Ben Dugan, former President of the Organized Retail Crime Resource Center.\n\nThe upshot was that the NRF had to retract the claim earlier this month and update its report. This garnered the kind of coverage that no organization wants, including this recent New York Times article.\n\nCrime Data Confusion\n\nDon\u2019t think that I\u2019m gloating over this mistake (and kudos to NRF for owning up to it). The fact is that it\u2019s extremely difficult to get accurate figures about retail crime \u2014 not just how much there is, but what exactly is causing it.\n\nFor example, while the popular image of \u201cshrink\u201d is customers stuffing items under their clothing (go to just after one minute in this Animal House clip to see what I mean), I learned long ago that a retailer\u2019s employees, using techniques like \u201csweethearting\u201d (cashiers ringing up items for less than the marked price in collaboration with the purchaser) or just plain theft, are often responsible for far more shrink than shoplifters. (That kind of makes sense as well: employees know how a retailer\u2019s loss prevention systems work, so the unscrupulous among them would have a better understanding of how to game the system for their own benefit.)\n\nAdditionally, definitions remain vague. If a cashier \u201csweethearts\u201d for his friends and family, how many people need to be involved for it to be classified as \u201corganized retail crime\u201d? Where do fraudulent returns fit in, and is it possible to definitively determine if these bad actors are working alone or for a larger group? (Amazon recently sued an international organization for its role in millions of dollars of returns fraud.) And let\u2019s not even get into cybercrime, where the black hats do everything they can to cover their nefarious tracks.\n\nThe NRF admitted the challenges associated with getting accurate crime data: \u201cWe stand behind the widely understood fact that organized retail crime is a serious problem impacting retailers of all sizes and communities across our nation,\u201d said an NRF spokesperson in comments provided to Retail TouchPoints. \u201cAt the same time, we recognize the challenges the retail industry and law enforcement have with gathering and analyzing an accurate and agreed-upon set of data to measure the number of incidents in communities across the country. Retailers and law enforcement agencies continue to experience daily incidents of theft, partner in large-scale investigations and report recoveries of stolen retail goods into the millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nPerception vs. Reality\n\nBut this narrative of a retail theft tsunami has been more than a data accuracy challenge. I\u2019d say one reason the NRF\u2019s figures weren\u2019t challenged earlier is that they fit into a perception of overall lawlessness. And here we get into another sticky wicket, because those perceptions are frequently shaped by people\u2019s political persuasion.\n\nIt\u2019s a common trope of right-wing media to paint cities (particularly those run by Democrats) as flaming trash cans of criminality. As New York Times opinion columnist Paul Krugman recently wrote: \u201cThe putative shoplifting tsunami has been relentlessly hyped both by the usual suspects, such as Fox News, and by some politicians.\u201d (Of course, my quoting a liberal talking head shows you where I\u2019m coming from politically.)\n\nI don\u2019t have any brilliant methods for getting that \u201caccurate and agreed-upon set of data\u201d that the NRF, and the retail industry as a whole, would like. I only know that solving, or at least mitigating, the impact of retail shrink requires that we all get a much better idea of where it\u2019s actually coming from."
