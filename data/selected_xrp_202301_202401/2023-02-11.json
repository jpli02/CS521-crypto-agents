        "content": "WA\u2019s summer Omicron wave may have subsided to a ripple, but with more than 20 people dying every week from the virus and the threat of long COVID looming large, those who have spent years on the frontline say the pandemic is far from over.\n\nNearly three years since the World Health Organisation declared COVID a pandemic in March 2020, WA hospitals are still treating a steady flow of cases and vulnerable regional communities remain very much alert to the danger. Some say it could be years until a \u201cnew normal\u201d is established."

        "title": "Nancy Jane Newhouse Leffler Obituary - The Indianapolis Star - IndyStar",
        "content": "Nancy Jane Newhouse Leffler, lifetime nurse and caring mother & grandmother, passed away on February 9, 2023 at the age of 87. Nancy was born in Indianapolis on November 6, 1935, to George and Wanda Newhouse. She attended Broad Ripple High School, Miami University and graduated from Indiana University\u2019s School of Nursing. Nancy worked in the OR, labor and delivery and retired after more than 25 years as a psychiatric nurse at Larue Carter Hospital. She was a tireless volunteer giving her time to Gennesaret Mobile Medical Clinic, Lawrence Township Schools tutoring, Indianapolis Public Library, Indpls Zoo/White River Gardens, Lawrence North High School, & Northminster Presbyterian Church. Nancy was a dedicated mother, avid gardener, dog lover, and walker. Over many decades, neighbors grew to enjoy watching for and greeting Nancy as she walked her dogs every morning and evening. Even while working full time, Nancy always valued family dinners while her children were growing up and took pride in the revelation her son Randy had when he went to school and discovered that kids had cookies that came from the store not their mother\u2019s oven. Grammy was a constant fixture in the stands at every sporting event of her grandchildren. Nancy is preceded in death by her husband of 42 years Truman Leffler, and her sister, Janeane (Donald) Abbitt. She is survived by her brother George \u201cBud\u201d Newhouse, children George \u201cRandy\u201d (Kim) Leffler of Fishers, and Meri (Adam) Weber of Indianapolis, and 4 grandchildren: Christian Leffler, Kendal (Matt) Speer, Cade Weber, & Cole Weber. Visitation will be held on Friday February 17 from 12:30-2:00 pm with a celebration of her life immediately following at Northminster Presbyterian Church, 1660 Kessler Blvd E Dr, Indianapolis, 46220. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Nancy\u2019s honor to Northminster, the Humane Society of Indianapolis, or the American Heart Association.

        "title": "Curiosity Just Found its Strongest Evidence of Ancient Water and Waves on Mars - Universe Today",
        "content": "This week, NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover stumbled across the best evidence yet that liquid water once covered much of Mars in the planet\u2019s distant past: undulating rippled rock formations \u2013 now frozen in time \u2013 that were sculpted by the waves of an ancient shallow lake. But perhaps the biggest surprise is that they were discovered in an area that researchers expected to be dry.\n\nNASA\u2019s Curiosity rover has been exploring Gale crater on Mars since 2014, studying the geologic history of the region and assessing whether the planet could ever have supported an environment suitable for organic life. Starting from the crater floor, the rover has been slowly climbing the foothills of Mount Sharp, the five-kilometer-tall central peak at the heart of Gale crater. As it climbs, it traverses Mars\u2019 geologic history. The lower rock layers at the bottom of the crater represent the oldest periods in Mars\u2019 history, and as it climbs higher it is able to study more and more recent deposits.\n\nThe ripples discovered this week were found in a region nicknamed the \u201cMarker Band\u201d, which sits about 800 meters above the crater floor. From orbit, the Marker Band looks dark in color, standing out from the slopes of Mount Sharp. It\u2019s well above the region where scientists expected to find evidence of water.\n\n\u201cWe climbed through thousands of feet of lake deposits and never saw evidence like this \u2013 and now we found it in a place we expected to be dry,\u201d said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity\u2019s project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nA panorama taken by the Curiosity rover on the Maker Band in Gale crater. To the right of the rover, ripples in the rock show evidence of an ancient lakebed. Beneath the rover\u2019s arm, two of Curiosity\u2019s attempted drill-holes can be seen in the rock. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS.\n\nThe rocks of the Marker Band contain salty minerals called sulfates, which are usually found in regions where previously wet regions are drying up. But the ripples are clear evidence of sediment stirred up by waves, just like the ripples found in the sand of shallow water beaches here on Earth.\n\nCuriosity is decked out with a suit of geology tools, but two attempts to drill into the Marker Band have been unsuccessful \u2013 the rock is too hard to penetrate. Future attempts will be made in the weeks ahead. In the meantime, there are other intriguing formations nearby that tell more of the story.\n\nA mosaic of 17 images captured in the \u201cMarker Band\u201d area by Curiosity\u2019s Mastcam in November 2022, showing regularly repeating layers, likely caused by repetitive, cyclical weather patterns in Mars\u2019 distant past. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS.\n\nNearby rocks, positioned just above the ripples, feature overlapping layers that are unusually regular in their spacing and thickness. Such regularity suggests a cyclical cause \u2013 perhaps repeated weather events or atmospheric phenomena like dust storms. It\u2019s an indication of a period of variable climate conditions at some point in Mars\u2019 history.\n\nLater this year, Curiosity is expected to have a chance to examine debris from a wet landslide in the nearby Gedis Valley, a depression carved partially by wind and partially by a long-vanished river.\n\nThis landslide debris is likely to be the most recent water-driven geology in Gale crater, deposited in a period long after the era of liquid lakes.\n\nGedis Valley, with distant landslide debris on the valley floor. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS.\n\nTaken together, these varied rock formations are helping build a climate timeline for Gale crater. \u201cThe wave ripples, debris flows, and rhythmic layers all tell us that the story of wet-to-dry on Mars wasn\u2019t simple. Mars\u2019 ancient climate had a wonderful complexity to it, much like Earth\u2019s,\u201d said Vasavada.\n\nLearn More:\n\n\u201cNASA\u2019s Curiosity Finds Surprise Clues to Mars\u2019 Watery Past.\u201d JPL.\n\nFeatured Image: Ripples formed billions of years ago by waves on a shallow lake, imaged by NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover.
