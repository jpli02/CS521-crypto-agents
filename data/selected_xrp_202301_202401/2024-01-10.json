        "title": "Ripple to be valued at US$11.3 bln following share repurchase - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ripple Labs, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency payments firm, will reportedly repurchase US$285 million of its shares, effectively valuing the company at US$11.3 billion.\n\nThe buyback initiative, which is aimed at early investors and employees, will allow them to sell up to 6% of their holdings, according to sources close to the matter cited by Reuters. This move comes as Ripple continues to navigate the complexities of the U.S. regulatory environment, with no immediate plans for a public offering.\n\nThe repurchase is part of a broader US$500 million buyback plan that includes costs associated with converting restricted stock units into common shares and related taxes. Ripple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse reportedly confirmed the tender offer and highlighted the company\u2019s strong financial position, with over US$1 billion in cash and more than US$25 billion in crypto assets, predominantly in XRP. The decision to buy back shares rather than pursue an initial public offering (IPO) provides liquidity to investors while maintaining greater control over the company\u2019s operations.\n\nIn December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and its executives for conducting unregistered securities offerings through the sale of XRP. However, a recent court ruling deemed that XRP sales on public exchanges did not constitute unregistered securities offerings, marking a partial victory for Ripple.\n\nThe significance of Ripple\u2019s share buyback lies in its alternative approach to providing investor exits. By opting for a tender offer instead of an IPO, Ripple avoids the additional scrutiny, market fluctuations, and investor expectations that come with going public.\n\nRipple\u2019s commitment to its payment protocol, which facilitates cross-border transactions and promotes the use of XRP, remains strong despite regulatory challenges. The company recently acquired the Switzerland-based crypto custody firm Metaco for US$250 million.\n\nXRP is the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization of approximately US$31 billion.\n\nXRP rose 1% to US$0.5759 in the last 24 hours, as of 4:00 p.m. ET, according to CoinGecko data."

        "content": "Experiments are carried out on a laboratory prototype version of the proposed NI-HGIC with the specifications mentioned in Table 1. The components employed to build and test the prototype converter are also mentioned.\n\nTable 1 Specifications of the proposed converter and the components used in the proposed NI-HGIC. Full size table\n\nFigure 4a depicts the photograph of proposed NI-HGIC and its experimental setup photograph is depicted in Fig. 4b. The gate pulses for the switches are generated by suitably programming a STM32F411RE microcontroller. The gate pulses are then applied to a MOSFET driver IRF25600 before interfacing them with the power circuit. Tektronix mixed domain oscilloscope (MDO4014C) along with standard accessories like differential high voltage probes (P5200A) and current probes (A622) are used to capture the experimental waveforms from proposed NI-HGIC.\n\nFigure 4 Photograph of (a) the prototype version of the proposed NI-HGIC. (b) The experimental set up used to test the NI-HGIC. Full size image\n\nFigure 5a,b respectively depict the experimental and simulated waveforms for the gate pulses (CH1, CH2), input voltage (CH3) and voltage measured across the load terminals (CH4). The proposed NI-HGIC employs an interleaved structure. The gate pulses to S 1 and S 2 are phase shifted by 180\u00b0 with a duty ratio of 0.5 and 50 kHz switching frequency. When 18 V is supplied as the input, the converter produces 380 V at the output. This validates the practical voltage conversion ratio of 21.11. Thus, the proposed hybrid gain extension technique combining CIs, voltage lift capacitors and DCMs employed in the proposed NI-HGIC is validated.\n\nFigure 5 Waveforms exhibiting voltage gain capacity during (a) experimentation, (b) simulation and voltage gain enhancement concept during (c) experimentation and (d) simulation. Full size image\n\nThe practical voltage waveforms across C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , C 01 are captured and presented in Fig. 5c through the channels CH1, CH2, CH3 and CH4 respectively. Since the voltage lift technique is used, the voltage that is obtained across C 1 , between the top plate and ground is dependent upon the states of S 1 and S 2 . The bottom plate of C 1 is grounded when S 1 is ON held at a potential which is equivalent to that of CBC when S 1 is OFF. Therefore, its voltage swings periodically as depicted through the CH1 waveform. The voltage across the DCM capacitors C 2 and C 3 (CH2, CH3 respectively) clearly validates the voltage gain contributed by DCM cells. By observing the voltage across C 01 (CH4) the net contribution of Stages 1 and 2 is also validated. Thus, the circuit synthesis and its proper operation is practically demonstrated and verified. Figure 5d portrays the simulated waveforms of the same parameters as in Fig. 5c.\n\nFigure 6a,b respectively depict the practical and simulated values of voltage stress experienced by the S 1 , S 2 and the output diode D 01 . The switches are employed at the two legs of the IBC structure and are operated with 180\u00b0 phase-shift. Hence, their complementary operation is validated. Additionally, when S 1 is ON, the passive elements located in Stages 1 and 2 store energy and the output diode D 01 remains in reverse-biased state. The correlation between the switches and D 01 is also verified from Fig. 6a. Interestingly, in the gain extension mechanism adopted in the proposed NI-HGIC, the switches are judiciously located closer to the input port. Consequently, S 1 and S 2 are subjected to very low voltage stress value which is only 10.5% of output voltage (CH4). The voltage spikes observed in the waveforms are caused by the leakage inductance of CIs. The voltage spikes in the waveforms are within the safe limits. The voltage across output diode D 01 (CH3) clearly depicts the complementary operation of S 1 and D 01 as expected. The slight increase in voltage stress magnitude of D 01 is mainly due to its proximity to the output port and its voltage stress magnitude matches with the value calculated using (18).\n\nFigure 6 Waveforms demonstrating the voltage stress on S 1 and S 2 with respect to output voltage during (a) experimentation and (b) simulation, (c) correlated operation of D 1 , D 2 , D 3 and V 0 profiles while experimenting and (d) simulating. Full size image\n\nFigure 6c depicts the proper operation of diodes D 1 , D 2, D 3 and their voltage stress levels compared to V 0 under practical conditions while the simulation results are portrayed in Fig. 6d. The diodes operate in a complementary manner as elaborated during the circuit operation and is illustrated through the practical voltage waveforms presented in CH1, CH2 and CH3 respectively. The voltage stress magnitude of D 1 , D 2 and D 3 is 72 V and is consistent with the value predicted using (17). Compared with the output voltage, the voltage stress level works out to 18.95% of V 0 . Since the DCM cells are adopted, each diode in the cell is subjected to a lower voltage stress magnitude as discussed theoretically and verified practically.\n\nFigure 7a demonstrates the complementary operation of D 4 , D 02 (CH1, CH2), voltage across the secondary-side capacitor C 02 (CH3) and the output voltage (CH4) during experimentation. Expectedly, the voltage developed across C 02 of Stage 3 in the proposed NI-HGIC is validated by (13). Since D 02 is located at the secondary side of the CIs, its voltage stress magnitude is very close to the voltage impressed across C 02 . Under simulated condition, the proposed converter exhibits similar behaviour as observed from Fig. 7b.\n\nFigure 7 Waveforms demonstrating the correlated operation of D 4 , D 02 , C 02 , V 0 during (a) experimentation, (b) simulation, (c) experimental waveforms of voltage stress on S 1 and S 2 in accordance with D 4 and D 02 and (d) simulated waveforms. Full size image\n\nFigure 7c,d are used to validate the correlated operation of the switches (S 1 -CH1, S 2 -CH2) which are located at Stage 1 and the diodes located in Stage 3 (D 4 -CH3, D 02 -CH4) during practical and simulated conditions respectively. The practical waveforms prove that when S 1 is ON, D 4 is reverse-biased and D 02 conducts. Thus, the diodes employed at the secondary-side of the CIs contribute to the voltage gain extension through Stage 3 of the proposed NI- HGIC. To summarize, the two switches and all the diodes employed in the NI-HGIC operate as expected and their voltage stress magnitudes are experimentally verified.\n\nThe experimental waveforms of the primary inductor currents (CH1, CH2) along with the input and output currents (CH3, CH4) are portrayed in Fig. 8a. CH1 and CH2 reveal the complementary charging and discharging profiles of L 1p and L 2p respectively. The interleaved arrangement employed in the NI-HGIC results in sharing of the input current by the primary windings of CI. Experimental waveforms indicate that the proposed NI-HGIC draws 10.8A from the source under full-load condition. Further, due to the operation of switches at D = 0.5 with 180\u00b0 phase-shift, the input current is free from ripples as observed from the practical waveforms (CH3). In fact, though the current through the individual inductors contain ripples, they are nullified due to the interleaved operation and the net input current is almost ripple-free. Due to the manufacturing imperfections, small current spikes are observed at the switching instants. Hence, the ripple content is calculated to be 11.11% of the total input current magnitude. Further, based on the voltage gain achieved, the output current magnitude (CH4) is observed and to be 0.48A. Thus, the proposed NI-HGIC delivers 185W power to the load at an output voltage of 380 V.\n\nFigure 8 Experimental waveforms of current through (a) L 1P , L 2P , the input (I in ) and the output (I o ), (b) switch S 1 , L 1s , L 2P , and L 2s . Full size image\n\nFigure 8b shows experimental waveforms of current through S 1 (CH1), secondary winding L 1s (CH2), primary winding L 2p (CH3) and secondary winding L 2s (CH4). As explained in Section \"Modes of operation\", currents through the secondary windings L 1s and L 2s exhibit an alternating (AC) behaviour due to their charging and discharging intervals. Their magnitudes are also on expected lines. Thus, the correlated operation of the switch current and the inductor currents is experimentally verified.\n\nThe practical efficiency of the prototype NI-HGIC under full-load condition is extracted from waveforms depicted in Fig. 9a. Based on the values of the voltages and currents captured at the input and output terminals, the prototype NI-HGIC delivers 185W at 94.8% efficiency. Since the semiconductor devices are subjected to low voltage levels, their ratings are reduced mainly due to the adopted gain extension technique. At 150W power level, the proposed NI-HGIC delivers power to the load at 390 V as illustrated in Fig. 9b. Since the load on the converter is slightly reduced, the output voltage increases marginally and the efficiency is about 92%.\n\nFigure 9 Practical waveforms of the proposed NI-HGIC to obtain efficiency (a) at full-load condition (185W) and (b) 150W. Full size image\n\nTo regulate the output voltage obtained from the proposed NI-HGIC when the input voltage and/or the load current undergoes step variations, digital proportional-integral (PI) based closed-loop is implemented. The STM32F411RE microcontroller is suitably programmed to fetch the actual V 0 value from the in-built analog-to-digital converter (ADC), compare it with the desired value (380 V) and generate the gate pulses to S 1 and S 2 using the timer module. Figure 10a depicts the dynamic response of the proposed NI-HGIC when the input voltage undergoes step variations. The output voltage obtained from the proposed NI-HGIC settles down quickly to the desired value of 380 V when the input voltage variation ranges from 15.6 V to 24.5 V. In absolute magnitude terms, the input voltage is variation is 8.9 V. Considering the nominal input voltage of 18 V, the experimental result proves the effectiveness of the closed-loop mechanism.\n\nFigure 10 Dynamic response of the proposed NI-HGIC under closed-loop condition when (a) line voltage (CH1) varies and (b) load current (CH3) undergoes a step variation. Full size image\n\nIn Fig. 10b, the load regulation profile of the proposed NI-HGIC is depicted. Under full-load condition (185W at 380 V), the nominal load current value is 486 mA. When the load on the proposed NI-HGIC is varied from 360 to 620 mA in a stepped manner, the output voltage profile undergoes overshoots and undershoots depending on the light or heavy load conditions respectively. Nevertheless, the output voltage is restored back to its nominal 380 V due to the implemented closed-loop control technique. Importantly, the overshoot and undershoot values of the output voltage are within acceptable limits. Thus, the converter is expected to be suitable for a practical DC microgrid application.\n\nThe efficiency curve of the converter under various load conditions during simulation and experimentation is demonstrated through Fig. 11a. The practical values match closely with the simulated values. To understand and appreciate the various losses that occur in the proposed NI-HGIC, standard expressions presented in25 are used. The losses that occur across the parasitic elements of the passive elements and the semiconductor devices are calculated and represented as a pie-chart in Fig. 11b. Due to the use of low voltage rated semiconductor devices, their conduction losses are reduced."
