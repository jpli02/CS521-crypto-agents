Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert reporting, Ripple sent back 800 million XRP, worth about $492.5 million, to its escrow system after unlocking 1 billion XRP, worth about $610 million, on Jan. 1, 2024. This action is part of Ripple's monthly routine of releasing and relocking a fixed amount of XRP from its escrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer crypto data tracker Whale Alert, the XRP move back to the Ripple escrow was done in two transactions.\n\nIn the first transaction, Ripple relocked 500,000,000 XRP worth $308,354,921 in its escrow. The second transaction returned to Ripple escrow was 300,000,000 XRP valued at $184,222,995. This comes after Ripple performed its monthly unlock of XRP tokens from its escrow.\n\nRipple released 1 billion XRP from its escrow earlier today in three transactions of 500 million, 400 million and 100 million XRP, according to Whale Alert.\n\nRipple's holdings are divided into two categories: XRP that it presently owns in its wallets and XRP that is subject to on-ledger escrow lockups that will be released monthly for the next 39 months.\n\nRipple does not have access to the latter category of XRP until the escrow releases it to Ripple monthly. The vast majority of this XRP released is returned to escrow.\n\nThe Ripple escrow system was launched in December 2017 to ensure predictability and stability of the XRP market. This escrow mechanism is planned to last until all 55 billion XRP have been released.\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.62, down 0.21% in the last 24 hours, and had a market capitalization of $33.56 billion, making it the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap."

        "title": "Ripple (XRP) v. SEC Lawsuit: The Most Important Developments in 2023 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nRipple had several partial legal victories against the SEC in 2023, including a ruling favoring its XRP sales and the clearing of its executives from allegations.\n\nThe court\u2019s decisions led to positive market reactions for XRP, with major cryptocurrency exchanges re-listing the token.\n\nThe final trial in the Ripple-SEC lawsuit is set for April 2024, with outcomes eagerly awaited by the cryptocurrency sector, as they could significantly influence the market and regulatory environment.\n\nRipple\u2019s Winning Streak in 2023\n\nThe whole fiasco between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started in December 2020. Back then, the watchdog fired the first shot, accusing the blockchain enterprise of selling XRP (the native token of the entity) in an unregistered security offering.\n\nThat action caused a heated battle, with both sides showing no signs of stepping back. Years passed by until one of the organizations took the upper hand. This happened in July 2023 when US Federal Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales to retail investors did not constitute an offer of investment contracts. Unsurprisingly, the court\u2019s decision positively affected the price of the token, which briefly surpassed $0.80.\n\nIt also triggered a wave of support from leading cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Kraken, which re-listed XRP on their platforms.\n\nUnhappy with the ruling, the SEC, under the regimen of Gary Gensler, attempted to appeal. However, the US magistrates dismissed that option, finding no substantial ground for a difference of opinion from the initial decision, giving Ripple a second partial victory.\n\nThe regulator had to endure a third setback at the end of October when Ripple\u2019s CEO \u2013 Brad Garlinghouse \u2013 and Executive Chairman \u2013 Chris Larsen \u2013 were cleared of all accusations brought by the SEC.\n\nThe Battle is Not Over\n\nBesides granting Ripple three major (yet partial) wins, the US magistrates have not said their final word on the case. At the beginning of October, they set April 23, 2024, as the date of the grand trial between the entities.\n\nA month later, Judge Torres required both parties to comply with all necessary procedures before meeting in court. The SEC must file its brief with respect to remedies by March 13, 2024, whereas Ripple must file its opposition by April 12, 2024.\n\nThe outcome of the lengthy battle is anticipated by numerous cryptocurrency participants since a decisive victory for the blockchain firm could lead to an overall market boom and increase the legitimacy of the whole industry.\n\nOn the other hand, a potential win for the SEC might negatively impact the digital asset sector and prompt the implementation of stringent rules that could hamper investors\u2019 interest."

        "title": "Is Ripple's (XRP) Price About to Explode? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The Ripple (CRYPTO: XRP) cryptocurrency rode a roller coaster in 2023. Starting the year at $0.35 per token, the international payment system's operating coin rose as high as $0.82 before dropping back down to $0.62. These sharp trend changes made the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) indices look sleepy by comparison, even though the market trackers delivered gains of historic scale last year:\n\nDigital asset investors see the latest crypto winter thawing out, and Ripple has several unique catalysts waiting in the wings. Is the token more properly known as XRP setting up for a rocket launch?\n\nLet's have a look.\n\nThe elephant in the courtroom\n\nAbove all else, Ripple investors keep a close eye on the lawsuit launched by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) three years ago. The suit halted XRP trading on American crypto brokerage services for two years, and the popular Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) platform still won't let you buy or sell Ripple. The risk of court-ordered fallout from potentially improper trading of digital assets is still too large.\n\nThe lawsuit took a significant step forward last summer, when District Judge Analisa Torres in the Southern District of New York dismissed most of the SEC's complaints. It wasn't a complete victory for XRP and Ripple Labs, and the charge of illegal trading of unregistered securities continues, but only in terms of institutional investors.\n\nThe final verdict of the SEC lawsuit will be game-changing. Ripple Labs set out to defend its conduct to the very end, avoiding settlements in order to set a legal precedent through a proper trial. The parties have document-filing deadlines to meet over the next few months, leading up to a jury trial in the summer or fall of 2024.\n\nThat could be the end of Ripple's courtroom drama, or the case might drag out with appeals over several more years. Either way, the token's price will surely react strongly to the progress (or lack thereof) of interim rulings. So a favorable outcome in that New York courtroom could indeed drive XRP's price higher in 2024 -- while a harsher verdict would have the opposite effect.\n\nThe business behind Ripple's digital coin\n\nMind you, the Ripple payment system runs a successful business outside American borders. The crypto network's trading volume actually spiked in the fall of 2020, several months after the court-inspired shutdown of U.S. trading. The volume stayed sky-high for a full year, indicating strong use of the quick-and-cheap payment system without access to the world's largest financial market.\n\nWith or without an American market with reasonable regulations, Ripple should gain value over time from its international footprint. On top of the border-crossing payments solution, the cryptocurrency also serves as a solid platform for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other crypto-based financial systems. Ripple has explored the CBDC opportunity since 2016 in tandem with mega-banks such as Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY), and Banco Santander (NYSE: SAN).\n\nThe development of standards and technologies to support Ripple-based CBDCs may have slowed down during the American lawsuit spectacle, but it never stopped. Recent success stories include a Ripple-powered stablecoin linked to the U.S. dollar in the tiny island nation of Palau. In the slightly larger but much richer market of Singapore, Ripple is now fully licensed to run digital payment services -- a step toward launching a full-on CDBC.\n\nThese projects should catch a second breath as cryptocurrencies become more mainstream. If and when partners like Bank of America and Santander announce fresh progress in their Ripple Labs collaborations, those press releases could prompt a bullish market response.\n\nXRP's gains should come, but maybe not right away\n\nSo Ripple's business prospects keep growing, no matter what happens to the SEC lawsuit. XRP is the sixth most valuable cryptocurrency today, and for good reason -- you're looking at a respectable digital solution to more than one problem in real-world financial services. Looking past the daily price swings, cryptocurrencies create true coinholder value via successful answers to financial questions.\n\nI'm not saying that Ripple is poised to pop in January, or that the token most certainly will rise later in 2024. However, it does seem poised for long-term success. If the XRP price doesn't soar in 2024, you might want to pick up some tokens on the cheap and settle down for stronger pricing in the years ahead.\n\nI don't mind waiting for a market-beating gain until 2025 or 2030 -- patience is a long-term investor's best friend, after all. In the meantime, XRP may pop or flop from time to time, giving investors the opportunity to cash in some gains or double down on the future opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in XRP right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and XRP wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.
