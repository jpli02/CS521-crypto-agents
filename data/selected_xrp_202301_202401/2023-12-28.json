        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights Ripple Labs moved $198 million worth of XRP from its escrow wallet, leaving $16.7 million remaining.\n\nThe escrow release is planned until 2027 and XRP price shows uncertainty with a potential breakout soon.\n\nLegal clarity after the SEC lawsuit dismissal adds to the intrigue surrounding Ripple's recent XRP transfer.\n\nRipple Labs made a significant move in December by transferring 310 million XRP, which amounts to $198 million, from its Ripple escrow wallet. As a result, the wallet now holds about 26.34 million XRP, valued at roughly $16.7 million.\n\nCurrently, the escrow contains less than 40 billion XRP tokens. There\u2019s a plan in place for their gradual release, set to continue until 2027. Initially, Ripple Labs minted 100 billion XRP tokens before introducing the XRP Ledger. Over time, the company has been selling these tokens in line with quarterly guidelines.\n\nToken Management Strategy\n\nRipple\u2019s key executives, who own a considerable portion of XRP, are subject to specific rules when selling their tokens. Their sales have a more noticeable impact compared to tokens used for transaction fees, which are generally minimal.\n\nRecent data suggests that XRP\u2019s price has been forming a symmetric triangle pattern since July. This pattern indicates uncertainty, signaling a potential price shift either upwards or downwards.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple Price: XRP Price Poised For 8 to 10x Rally Soon\n\nFactors Influencing XRP Price\n\nXRP\u2019s unique position as both a store of value and a player in instant payments brings its own set of influences.\n\nDespite concerns about its centralized nature, XRP has found practical applications in facilitating quick transactions, as evidenced by the National Bank of Georgia partnering with Ripple Labs for a central bank digital currency pilot.\n\nLegal Developments and Ripple\u2019s Position\n\nUS Judge Analisa Torres earlier this year dismissed the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) claims regarding Ripple selling XRP as unregistered securities. The judge\u2019s ruling brought clarity, specifying that sales to institutional investors, as opposed to retail investors, constituted unregistered securities offerings. This decisive verdict left the SEC without grounds for an appeal.\n\nGiven this legal and financial backdrop, Ripple\u2019s recent XRP transfer has generated interest and speculation. The industry is keenly watching to understand Ripple\u2019s intentions and the potential implications on XRP\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nRead More: XRP Yearly Review: Ripple Legal Wins Pave Way for 2024 Price Boom"

        "title": "Judge rules Terra 'stablecoin' and other tokens are securities in victory for the SEC and departure from Ripple case - Fortune",
        "content": "A federal judge sided with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a closely watched crypto case on Thursday, ruling that four crypto tokens offered by the failed Terraform Labs company\u2014including UST and LUNA\u2014constituted unregistered securities.\n\nAs the crypto industry battles regulators over how to classify digital assets, the decision is a setback for the sector\u2019s interpretation of securities law and a departure from a separate decision by a different judge in the Southern District of New York over the token XRP.\n\nIn his 71-page decision, Judge Jed Rakoff wrote that there is \u201cno genuine dispute\u201d that the four crypto tokens offered by Terraform were securities because \u201cthey are investment contracts,\u201d arguing that defendants wanted to \u201ccast aside decades of settled law,\u201d citing the seminal Supreme Court precedent called the Howey test.\n\n\u201cHowey\u2019s definition of \u2018investment contract\u2019 was and remains a binding settlement of the law, not dicta,\u201d wrote Rakoff.\n\nThe trials of Do Kwon\n\nDuring crypto\u2019s bull run of 2021, Terraform Labs represented one of the most successful projects in the sector, raking in billions of dollars and backed by prominent investors in the space. With its so-called algorithmic stablecoin, UST, Terraform cofounder Do Kwon promised a crypto token that could maintain a $1 peg through a complicated system of distributing a secondary cryptocurrency called LUNA.\n\nLess than a year later, UST lost its $1 peg in a spectacular meltdown in May of 2022, causing investors\u2014including retail traders across the world\u2014to lose their money. The prices for both UST and LUNA plummeted in a death spiral. Kwon was soon arrested in Montenegro, triggering an ongoing extradition fight between the U.S. and his home country of South Korea, with fraud charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nIn February 2023, the SEC sued Terraform Labs and Kwon, alleging that they orchestrated a multibillion-dollar securities fraud by offering unregistered securities, including UST and LUNA, as well as two other crypto tokens tied to the ecosystem, MIR and wLUNA.\n\nIn response, lawyers for the defendants made an argument similar to that of other crypto companies currently in legal battle with the SEC: U.S. securities law is antiquated, and crypto tokens do not fall under the traditional definition of the Howey test because they did not represent an investment in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit derived from the effort of others. UST, after all, was meant to maintain a $1 peg.\n\nAfter U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in a separate court case involving the crypto company Ripple\u2014finding that its crypto token XRP itself was not a security, and that its sale only constituted an investment contract in certain contexts\u2014lawyers for Terra filed a motion to dismiss.\n\nRakoff, the judge overseeing the Terra case, threw cold water on his colleague\u2019s decision, dismissing the motion and rejecting the approach used by Torres to distinguish how different digital assets are sold.\n\nThursday\u2019s decision furthers Rakoff\u2019s argument that the sale of Terraform\u2019s crypto assets constituted an unregistered security. Even with UST, the token meant to be pegged to $1, Rakoff argued that holders of the token could deposit the tokens in a proprietary protocol developed by Terraform to earn back a yield. The distinction, however, seems to support the argument that stablecoins that do not offer a yield would not constitute a security.\n\nRakoff left one matter of the case unsettled\u2014the question of fraud claims related to UST\u2019s depeg brought by the SEC. In his decision, Rakoff wrote that the SEC\u2019s evidence for its allegations comes from third-party whistleblowers that should be heard before a jury. Furthermore, he argued that defendants have shown a \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d over whether a \u201creasonable investor\u201d would have found statements around UST\u2019s depeg to be misleading. Part of the pending case will relate to the involvement of Jump, a prominent trading firm that served as one of Terra\u2019s main backers.\n\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the decision and do not believe that the UST stablecoin or the other tokens at issue are securities. Further, the SEC\u2019s fraud claims are not supported by evidence, and we will continue to vigorously defend against those meritless allegations at trial,\u201d said a spokesperson for Terraform Labs in a statement shared with Fortune.\n\nThe jury trial is scheduled to begin in January 2024."

        "content": "XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple payment protocol network, has taken investors on a wild ride since its debut in August 2013. If you had invested $1,000 in XRP on its first trading day at just $0.0058893 per token, your stake would have grown to $652,030 when it reached its all-time high of $3.84 on Jan. 4, 2018.\n\nBut today, XRP trades at about $0.62, so your investment would have shrunk back to about $105,276.

It was designed to facilitate \"secure, instant, and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.\" It subsequently pre-mined 100 billion XRP tokens to serve as the platform's native cryptocurrency. Just over half of those tokens are in circulation, while most of the remaining tokens are locked in an escrow account to ensure the market's supply remains stable.\n\nXRP didn't gain much attention until the rise of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) drew more mainstream investors to the crypto market. Since XRP was already pre-mined, the bulls promoted it as a more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient alternative to the other two.\n\nXRP's relatively extended history and support from Ripple's established payment platform -- which already serves a growing number of financial customers like Travelex Bank, Tranglo, and Sentbe -- also made it seem like a safer play than many of the altcoins on the market. It's currently the world's sixth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $35 billion.\n\nWhat's keeping XRP below a dollar?\n\nFor successful cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, rising above $1 marked the major inflection point in their long-term rallies. However, XRP dropped below $1 in late 2021 and has remained under that threshold for three reasons.\n\nFirst, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple Labs and two of its executives in December 2020 for raising $1.3 billion through an offering of XRP tokens. The SEC claims those tokens should have been classified as securities, and therefor registered with the agency in compliance with securities regulations. The SEC subsequently dropped the cases against Ripple's individual executives, but the overall case against Ripple hasn't been resolved yet. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple's XRP tokens had more in common with a foreign currency than an unregistered security. Torres subsequently rejected a request by the SEC to appeal that ruling in October, but the SEC still hasn't given up on cracking down on Ripple yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, Ripple faces fierce competition from similar blockchain-driven platforms like Ethereum and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL). Ethereum serves a broader range of markets than Ripple, which mainly serves financial institutions, while Solana processes its blockchain transactions at a much faster rate than Ripple.\n\nFinally, rising interest rates broadly drove investors away from cryptocurrencies in 2022. Some cryptocurrencies have gradually stabilized over the past year, but they probably won't fully recover until interest rates cuts arrive.\n\nCould XRP head higher over the next few years?\n\nXRP isn't the most exciting cryptocurrency on the market, but a few near-term catalysts could easily propel its price back above $1. It might only be a matter of time before Ripple wins its case against the SEC, and widely expected interest rate cuts in 2024 will likely draw investors back to riskier investments like cryptocurrencies again. A weaker greenback should also drive up the prices of cryptocurrencies alongside precious metals and other hard assets.\n\nAs a result, I don't think it's too late for investors who missed out on XRP's huge rally over the past decade to hop aboard the bullish bandwagon. All of its core strengths suggest it could head a lot higher once it resolves its near-term challenges.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in XRP right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and XRP wasn't one of them.
