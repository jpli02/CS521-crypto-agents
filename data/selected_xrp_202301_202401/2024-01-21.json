        "content": "Ripple Labs chief executive Brad Garlinghouse is predicting that regulatory clarity will come to stablecoins in 2024.\n\nIn a new interview with CNBC International, Garlinghouse says that the US government will create clear guidelines for the stablecoin industry this year as he believes dollar-pegged crypto assets have important utility.\n\n\u201cI think this year there will be legislation that passes. I won\u2019t be as predictive about which one I think, but the likelihood is that the [Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act] \u2013 I can\u2019t remember the name of the bill that has been going through the system in Washington DC \u2013 but I think we will see that in part because the US Treasury wants it.\n\nI think the stablecoin market has really surprised people in some ways in terms of solving a real need, and I think it only makes sense for there to be regulatory clarity around that I think that\u2019s good for the whole industry.\u201d\n\nGarlinghouse goes on to say that stablecoins such as USDT and USDC are here to stay and that if they have any skeletons in their closet, they will come to be known once clear guidelines are established for the nascent crypto sector.\n\n\u201cOne of the things you said earlier is, are there skeletons in the closet? The stablecoin market, because there hasn\u2019t been clear rules of the road, it\u2019ll be interesting as that comes to fruition.\n\nThe two primary [stablecoins] \u2013 obviously USDT and USDC \u2013 I think they are here to stay and I think you\u2019re going to see other entrants in that market too.\u201d\n\nThe Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act was proposed last year and would require stablecoin issuers to hold all reserves associated with dollar-pegged digital assets in U.S dollars, government securities, or fully collateralized repurchase agreements.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 A restaurant that proudly proclaims itself as \"Indiana's Best Beer Bar\" on its windows is closing its doors for good at the end of the month.\n\nHopCat announced on social media Thursday that it will close its location at the corner of Broad Ripple Avenue and College Avenue on Jan. 28.\n\nThe Michigan-based restaurant posted this statement about the closure:\n\nFor the past 10 years, it has been our pleasure to share great craft beer and made-from-scratch food with the Broad Ripple community. It is with regret that we announce the last day of service at HopCat Broad Ripple will be on 1/28/2024.\n\n\n\nPlease join us in raising a pint to our amazing staff, many of whom have been with us since we opened our doors. We thank you for your support and hope to see you before we close our doors later this month. And if your travels bring you our way, we look forward to serving you at another one of our 10 HopCat locations.\n\n\n\nIf you have questions, please email Guest Relations at support@hopcat.com.\n\nHopCat employee River Bennett said they and their co-workers suddenly learned about the closure from a human resources professional on Wednesday.\n\n\"No one in our store knew,\" Bennett said. \"General manager, assistant general manager...no one knew. We've been booking events for the summer time. We have wedding parties that people scheduled with us that they can't do anymore.\"\n\nBennett hoped HopCat executives would have given employees more time to try and find a new job.\n\n\"I'm sure the HR person would want a two-week notice from me if I was leaving, but she did let us know she could have told us we're let go by just putting a note on the door,\" Bennett said.\n\nThe small window between the closure announcement and the last day of business allowed customers to come back for one last meal.\n\n\"I said, 'I've got to go try it again,\" said Andrew Larrigan, who said he had eaten at HopCat at least six times over the years. \"The fries and the burgers are so good, and so is the beer selection. I'm sad to see it go.\"\n\nLarrigan dined at HopCat Saturday afternoon and soon realized he was not the only person who wanted a final bite and brew.\n\n\"The host said it was an hour wait today, but we lucked out and got a seat at the bar,\" Larrigan said.\n\nBennett did not have to wait long for another job opportunity.\n\n\"I had 30 to 40 different restaurants reaching out to me to offer me employment, which was wonderful,\" Bennett said. \"I was stressed. I thought I was going to get evicted.\"\n\nBennett does not regret working for HopCat, but remains upset about the way it ended.\n\n\"A lot of us had put all of our eggs in this basket and a lot of us had families,\" Bennett said. \"They dropped the news on us like it was nothing.\"\n\nHopCat does not have any other locations in Indiana. Its only other location outside of Michigan is in Lincoln, Nebraska."

        "title": "The Clash of Titans: Ripple, Hedera, SWIFT, and FedNow in the Battle for Financial Supremacy - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "SWIFT and institutional products like FedNow have dominated the payments market, but with blockchain solutions from Ripple, Hedera and others gaining popularity, the end is nigh.\n\nUnlike SWIFT and FedNow, blockchain platforms are instant, have lower fees, are accessible 24/7, eliminate middlemen, and give users ownership of their data.\n\nGlobal trade relies on efficient payment systems, and for decades, the same few players have dominated the sector. Despite their inefficiencies, the likes of SWIFT have been the go-to services for cross-border funds transfers. This is changing, and as Ripple, Hedera, Stellar, and other blockchain networks become more prominent, the legacy players face their most formidable challenge yet.\n\nTrillions of dollars move globally daily\u2014the global forex trading market alone accounts for over $6.6 trillion daily. Banks remain the most used avenue, a position they have enjoyed for several decades. Fintech startups have jumped on the map in recent times, but they still pale in comparison to the big banks.\n\nHowever, banks face several challenges as they have refused to change. While you can send a message from one end of the world to another in seconds, transferring money takes at least three business days. Even worse, you\u2019d have to wait longer if this falls on the weekend or a public holiday. All this is done at premium fees, with a World Bank study finding that citizens in most African countries have to part with about 8% of the money they receive from other countries, including their neighbours, as fees.\n\nHow these banks have maintained a chokehold on the payments systems is puzzling. However, all this could end as blockchain technology invades this almost impenetrable market to offer users the cheapest, fastest and most convenient solutions.\n\nSWIFT vs Blockchain: Clash of the Titans\n\nUnlike the SWIFT-reliant banks, blockchain technology offers users a new way to send value worldwide in seconds for a tiny fraction of the cost. Ripple\u2019s XRPL, for instance, only costs 0.00001 XRP, or $0.0000055, to send any amount of money anywhere. To contextualize it, $1 could pay for 181,000 transactions on XRP. According to the UN, sending $200 by bank on average globally costs 6.5%, or $13.\n\nRipple, the blockchain payments firm which pushes for the adoption of XRPL in payments, has been working on partnerships that integrate the blockchain into existing systems.\n\n\u201cSince the start, Ripple focused on creating products that solve real problems for real customers. This evolution of Ripple Payments represents an extension of our long-running work to optimize the cross-border payment experience through transformative technology,\u201d stated the company\u2019s president, Monica Long.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that banks are a dying breed in the face of the blockchain revolution. Cognizant of the potential of the technology, banks have been working on integrating blockchain. SWIFT, which faces the most significant threat, has been working to integrate various blockchains as it seeks to evolve and keep its place in the world of payments.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "title": "Ripple fires back at 'untimely' SEC request as XRP sell-off persists - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The legal battle between the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and blockchain firm Ripple is persisting, with both sides currently tussling over financial statements.\n\nSpecifically, the regulator had previously filed a motion to compel Ripple to disclose its financial statements for 2022-2023 and post-complaint contracts.\n\nIn the latest development, Ripple has countered the SEC\u2019s demand by filing a motion challenging it. Defense attorney James Filan, in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on January 19, revealed that Ripple deemed the motion \u2018untimely.\u2019\n\nThe court filing disclosed that Ripple argues the SEC\u2019s requests are untimely, emphasizing that the regulatory body had ample opportunities during fact discovery to pursue the requested information.\n\nFurthermore, Ripple\u2019s legal team contended that the appropriateness of post-complaint discovery has previously undergone litigation.\n\n\u201cThe SEC requests are irrelevant and has no bearing on the court\u2019s remedies determination. The SEC\u2019s considering whether Ripple\u2019s post-complaint conduct violated the law will need a lengthy fact discovery period or a new litigation,\u201d Ripple said.\n\nRipple also highlighted that, during this dispute, the SEC consistently asserted that such discovery was irrelevant to remedies. Consequently, Ripple asserts that the SEC should be prevented from reversing its position.\n\nPossible delays\n\nExpressing concern about potential delays caused by the SEC\u2019s demand, Ripple believes that reexamining whether its post-complaint conduct breached the law could extend the proceedings, necessitating an extensive and protracted fact-discovery period.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the SEC-Ripple trial, set to begin in April, originated from charges filed by the regulator in 2020, alleging that Ripple raised funds by selling unregistered securities in XRP tokens.\n\nIn a significant development in 2023, Ripple partially won when the judge ruled that XRP does not qualify as a security.\n\nDespite ongoing legal challenges, Ripple continues to view the case as part of hostile regulatory actions in the United States.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, noted that the regulatory situation prompted the exploration of a possible initial public offering (IPO) outside the US. However, the IPO plans have been put on hold for now.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nElsewhere, the latest developments in the case have had a minimal impact on the value of XRP, which continues to trade under pressure. By press time, XRP was valued at $0.55, reflecting daily gains of about 0.60%. On the weekly chart, XRP is down over 4%.\n\nXRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold.\n\nAt the same time, XRP technical analysis reveals bearish sentiments, with a summary of one-day gauges indicating a \u2018sell\u2019 rating at 15, moving averages are for \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 13, and oscillators align with \u2018neutral\u2019 sentiment at 8.\n\nXRP technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nOverall, since XRP lost its support level at $0.60, analysts speculate that the token might experience further drops before a potential rally.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
