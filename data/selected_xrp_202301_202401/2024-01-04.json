        "title": "Ripple May Dump Over 200,000,000 XRP This Month - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Leading crypto payment company Ripple could dump over 200 million XRP from the 1 billion coins it released from escrow on January 1, 2024.\n\nFollowing the latest unlock of 1 billion XRP from escrow by Ripple, the crypto payment company immediately re-locked 80% of the total sum while the remaining 20% was sent to the firm\u2019s spending account.\n\nRipple\u2019s Latest Unlock\n\nThe Crypto Basic tracked these transactions to identify how these unlocks could affect the long-term value of XRP. In what has become a routine exercise, Ripple unlocked 1 billion XRP in three tranches on January 1.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile \u2018Ripple (22)\u2019 received a lump sum of 500 million XRP, \u2018Ripple (23)\u2019 received a total of 500 million XRP in two transactions.\n\nShortly after the transaction, \u2018Ripple (22)\u2019 sent 200 million XRP to the company\u2019s spending account labeled \u2018Ripple (1)\u2019, while the remaining 300 million XRP coins were sent to another address owned by the company, \u2018Ripple (11)\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, \u2018Ripple (23)\u2019 also moved 500 million XRP to \u2018Ripple (10)\u2019. Interestingly, \u2018Ripple (11)\u2019 was used to lock the 300 million XRP in an escrow account programmed to be released on May 1, 2027. Additionally, \u2018Ripple (10)\u2019 also locked the 500 million XRP in escrow until June 1, 2027.\n\nAt the time of writing, \u2018Ripple (22)\u2019 and \u2018Ripple (23)\u2019 hold a combined 1 billion XRP. Both accounts will hold the coins until Ripple releases another 1 billion XRP from escrow.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFollowing Ripple\u2019s latest re-locking exercise, the company now holds 45.9 billion XRP in escrow, worth $26.1 billion.\n\nRipple Could Dump Over 200M XRP By January\n\nWith Ripple re-locking 80% of the 1 billion XRP unlocked on January 1, it sent 200 million XRP to \u2018Ripple (1)\u2019. At press time, \u2018Ripple (1)\u2019 holds a total of 226 million XRP, equivalent to $131.08 million.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the funds in this account would be disbursed to other accounts before they are finally sold in the market.\n\nFor context, \u2018Ripple (1)\u2019 also received 200 million XRP from \u2018Ripple (22)\u2019 last month after the usual monthly XRP unlock program. Before the month ended, \u2018Ripple 1\u2019 moved a total of 310 million XRP worth $179.8 million to this address \u2018rP4X2\u2026sKxv3\u2019 in four tranches.\n\nThe funds were later sent to two additional accounts: \u2018rhWt2\u2026E32hk\u2019 and \u2018r4wf7\u2026h4Rzn\u2019 before they were finally sent to different centralized exchanges, including Bitstamp and Bitso.\n\nNotably, the 226 million XRP currently held in \u2018Ripple (1)\u2019 could be dumped in the same pattern as seen in previous months. At press time, \u2018Ripple (1)\u2019 has yet to make any transaction since it received the 200 million XRP. However, it is only a matter of days or weeks before the 226 million XRP are sold on centralized exchanges."

        "content": "Ripple price has likely bottomed out, with both the RSI and the ADX indicators showing the prevailing trend strengthening.\n\nXRP could ascend to the $0.6500 level amid rising momentum and the filing of the insufficiency in the market (FVG).\n\nThe bullish thesis will be invalidated if the payment token\u2019s price breaks and closes below the $0.5580 support level.\n\nRipple (XRP) recorded a massive dip during the Wednesday trading session, but this has turned out to be a healthy correction as it saw the payments token fill an imbalance in the XRP market. Now, the upside potential may come to fruition with multiple trend strength quantifiers showing rising momentum.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price hit a three-year low against Bitcoin as fears of Spot BTC ETF rejection span the market\n\nXRP dip on Wednesday was a healthy correction\n\nRipple (XRP) price hit a three-year low against Bitcoin on January 3, coming on the back of a widespread sell-off triggered by a blog suggesting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would reject spot BTC exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe XRP/USD three-month low at $0.5000 saw Ripple price fill an imbalance or inefficiency in the market, represented by the Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $0.4927 and$0.5111. An FVG is significant as it represents errors in the market, and the price always tends to revert to these areas and fill the gap with some more trades.\n\nWith the FVG filled, the XRP price appears ready to recover, with multiple trend strength quantifiers, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Average Directional Index (ADX) indicators showing growing bullish effort.\n\nWhen the RSI is moving north, it means momentum is growing, while the ADX quantifies strength. When the ADX line rises, it means the trend strength is increasing, so the prevailing trend will continue. However, when the ADX line is falling, the trend strength in question is decreasing and the asset\u2019s price could enter a retracement or consolidation period.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP is among the altcoins that are benefiting from the abounding hope that the US SEC will ultimately approve the spot BTC ETF applications. Evidence of this hope can be seen in the latest development, where the filers, among them VanEck, Grayscale and Fidelity, have filed for registration of securities with the financial regulator. The approval hype momentum appears to be in full swing after the SEC met with NYSE, NASDAQ, and CBOE exchanges to discuss the spot BTC ETF.\n\nRipple price readies for a possible 20% climb\n\nWith the inefficiency in the market filled, Ripple price is poised for a recovery, with the RSI showing rising momentum and the ADX showing that the ongoing recovery is steadily gaining strength.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Ripple price restore back within the fold of the rising wedge above the $0.6000. Further north, the price could extend to shatter past the upper boundary of the rising wedge to tag the $0.6500 level.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend for Ripple price to collect the sell side liquidity residing above to tag the $0.7000 psychological level. Such a move would constitute a 20% climb above current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nEarly profit booking from traders that suffered Wednesday\u2019s losses could see XRP price push south, potentially revisiting the FVG. A break and close below the midline of this order block at $0.5023 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, with an extended fall likely to see XRP market value hit the range low at $0.4174."

        "content": "The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs Inc. and a group of XRP investors led by Vladi Zakinov is set to reach a pivotal moment on January 11, 2024, as both parties prepare for a significant court hearing. This date, highlighted by the XRP community and closely monitored by the cryptocurrency sector, marks a crucial phase in a case that could have potentially far-reaching implications for Ripple and XRP.\n\nRipple Vs. Zakinov: Proceedings Resume On January 11\n\nCrypto Eri, a prominent figure in the XRP community, shared the official court notice on a social media platform, detailing the logistics of the upcoming Zoom hearing. The notice, issued by the court, specifies that the hearing is about the \u201cMotion to Approve the Form and Manner of Class Notice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a procedural step critical for ensuring that all potential class members in this lawsuit are adequately and fairly informed about the case, their rights, and the actions they might need to take.\n\nZakinov et al v. Ripple Labs, Inc. et al This is a ZOOM HEARING set for 1/11/2024 at 01:30 PM Webinar Access: All counsel, members of the public, & media may access the webinar information at https://t.co/7BcPnPVugN\n\nZoom Guidance: https://t.co/uXJrxSbYzg\n\n\ud83d\udc47Follow the rules\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/qz4o1k5MG6 \u2014 \ud83c\udf38Crypto Eri \ud83e\ude9dCarpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) January 4, 2024\n\nThis notice is a crucial step in ensuring that the legal process is fair and transparent to all parties involved. The \u201cform\u201d of the notice refers to its content and layout, while the \u201cmanner\u201d refers to the method of distribution, such as through mail, publication, or digital means.\n\nThe court\u2019s role in approving the form and manner of the notice is to ensure that it is clear, concise, and effective in reaching all class members. The court also ensures that the notice complies with legal standards and provides sufficient information for class members to make informed decisions about their participation in the lawsuit.\n\nBill Morgan, a lawyer active within the XRP community, provided his insights, expressing his intention to join the hearing and offer comments.\n\nReflecting on the case\u2019s history, Morgan noted the contrasting support dynamics within the XRP holder community. While a small faction supports Zakinov\u2019s stance against Ripple, a significantly larger group aligns with Ripple.\n\nHe stated:\n\nThanks Eri. I will be joining if there is no restriction and giving comments. Last year XRP investors were granted class status in the lawsuit of Zakinov v. Ripple Labs [\u2026] even though the number of XRP holders that support Zakinov against Ripple you could count on one hand compared to the hundreds of thousands that supported Ripple against the SEC including the almost 80,000 that joined the Amici army of John Deaton.\n\nClass Status Already Confirmed\n\nThe last development in the case came eight months ago when the class led by Zakinov was granted class status in the lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The class certification, confirmed by Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton, was a pivotal moment, setting the stage for a class action that accuses Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security. This allegation, if proven, could have substantial implications for Ripple.\n\nLead plaintiff Vladi Zakinov, who held XRP for a brief period, seeks to represent a class of XRP owners who allege that XRP is a security issued by Ripple. The class aims to include all XRP owners worldwide who bought and currently hold XRP or those who sold it at a loss. This class action, therefore, encompasses a wider array of XRP investors (in comparison to the SEC case).\n\nThe January 11 hearing, therefore, is not just a routine procedural step. It\u2019s a pivotal event that will set the stage for another crucial battle for Ripple. The trial is expected to begin on April 15, 2024. Remarkably, the original lawsuit was filed in May 2018.\n\nAt press time, XRP traded at $0.57137.\n\nFeatured image from Vauld, chart from TradingView.com"

The dynamic cultural hub, bridging the Grand Theater, the Museum, and the Sports Center under a floating sun canopy with surrounding public spaces, sits in dialogue with its natural surroundings as its design infuses elements that capture the humble spirit of Southern Guangdong alongside Nanhai\u2019s traditional culture.\n\nWith construction set to start in 2024, it will redefine the urban waterfront experience on both sides of the river upon completion in 2029, and provide local communities with a new public gateway embedded with diverse services, recreational activities, and shopping experiences. Lead architect Ma Yansong notes: \u2018The large overhangs of traditional southern Guangdong architecture and the gray space that provides shade, rain, and ventilation are all sources of inspiration for the art center. The architectural space suitable for the natural climate and the application of new green technologies are trying to explore a model of contemporary Lingnan architecture.\u2019\n\n\n\nall images courtesy of MAD Architects\n\na vibrant hub bridging architecture, culture, and nature\n\nDeparting from the conventional image of a solitary and static sculptural object, the team at MAD Architects proposes a vibrant epicenter for community engagement, inviting the public to participate in a lifestyle immersed in culture. The Grand Theater brings together immersive spaces including a 1,500-seat main theatre and a 600-seat multi-purpose hall \u2014 both designed to accommodate the needs of various dynamic performing arts, conferences, and experiences. The upcoming National Museum hosts an array of comprehensive exhibits, inviting exploration, education, and discovery to help strengthen the local and global community, while the Sports Center includes leisure, recreation, and fitness amenities including swimming pools, basketball, and badminton courts.\n\nSituated in the Nanhai Cultural District, flanked by the Foshan Waterway to its south and the Qiandeng Lake Park to the north, the Nanhai Art Center\u2019s design is centered around its encompassing bodies of water, creating a visual corridor that connects the three venues.

The elevated landscape serves a dual purpose; beneath it, the first-floor commercial services integrate, efficiently managing public parking and logistical operations.

        "title": "Broad Ripple HS basketball star dies. No one claims his body. Then a classmate steps in - IndyStar",
        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS -- They were two Broad Ripple High School kids with just about nothing in common. Nothing except the magic that happened inside the concrete walls of a raucous basketball gym.\n\nDonnie Harris was the athlete, a feisty, fiery guard. A star who led Broad Ripple to a semi-state battle against New Castle and the Indiana golden boy Steve Alford.\n\nBill Myers was the artist, a bass player in the school's jazz band. A star who stood in the bleachers rallying the team through music.\n\nWhen the Broad Ripple band started playing its go-to tunes, \"Ain't No Stopping Us Now\u201d or \"Shining Star\" or any other popular song from the early 1980s, Harris would look up at Myers from the middle of the basketball court and stare right into his eyes.\n\nThe music Myers and his band played was Harris' fuel on the court. There was a kindred connection between the two, an unspoken connection.\n\nBut when high school ended and the two graduated in 1984, Harris and Myers lost touch, as often happens to high school acquaintances. Their paths veered in very different directions.\n\nFor the next three decades, Myers was absorbed in a successful acting career in big cities like Chicago and New York. He won an Emmy, starred in a soap opera and performed on Broadway.\n\nFor the next three decades, Harris was struggling to survive, sometimes homeless and sometimes addicted to drugs and sometimes living in darkness on the streets of Indy.\n\nOn occasion, his Broad Ripple High classmates would spot Harris on a city bench or on the sidewalk and say hello. Harris was always so friendly and kind. He was always so grateful to see them.\n\nAs Myers lived a star-studded life in the big city, he heard about those encounters and, when he moved back to Indy, he had a few of those Harris encounters as well.\n\nBut five months ago, Myers would have his last encounter with Harris in the emergency waiting room at IU Health Methodist Hosptial. Myers was there with his mother when he ran into Harris, who was there for himself. They sat for two hours and talked, catching up.\n\nMyers talked about his passion for music and the arts, but mostly they talked about Harris. His love of basketball, his tough life journey, how he had finally climbed his way from the depths of his addiction and homelessness to a house at 14th and Pennsylvania streets. His very own place.\n\nThe two took a selfie, parted ways and Myers didn't hear from Harris again. Not until Dec. 19 when he learned that Harris had died at the age of 57 alone in his home, the low-income housing he had been so proud to live in.\n\nThen Myers learned that no one had come forward to claim Harris' body and that he would have no funeral. And that no one would remember his life, his Broad Ripple High School spirit. No one would pay their respects.\n\nThe way Myers saw things, coming from a Hollywood career, everyone deserves a standing ovation. Harris deserved a standing ovation.\n\nSo, he went to work making sure that would happen, that Harris would be given the funeral he deserved.\n\nAll it took was rallying a fiercely loyal legion of Broad Ripple classmates and a community who cared deeply about a lost soul, a forgotten high school basketball star.\n\n'A future for Donnie that Donnie didn't see himself'\n\nHarris died eight days before his 58th birthday in his home, alone. After the required grace period and advertisements of his death, he had no family that came forward to claim his body, which was devastating and sad, but not a surprise to those who knew his story.\n\nBetsy (Blankenbaker) Murphy grew up with Harris. Her family met his family through church when he was six years old.\n\nWhen Harris was 13, tragedy struck, his dad died. Not long after that, his mother suffered severe health issues and Murphy's parents, Richard and Virginia Blankenbaker, took Harris in to live with them for his final high school years.\n\n\"Donnie was a star basketball player during the early 1980s at Broad Ripple and you would often see my parents cheering him on at his games,\" Murphy posted to Facebook after Harris' death. \"I was a swimmer and dad never came to my swim meets but he was at most of Donnie's games. My father loved basketball and was so proud of Donnie's accomplishments, both on the court and off the court as a student.\"\n\nAt one point, Murphy said, her father believed Harris would have the basketball career of Isiah Thomas. \"There's not a better passer in the state of Indiana,\" he said during Harris' final year at Broad Ripple.\n\nHarris earned a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin where he started in the fall of 1986.\n\n\"Donnie earned the scholarship. Dad just reminded him to believe in himself,\" Murphy wrote. \"And like many teenagers, sometimes Donnie got into trouble and my dad took it hard. I think often my father saw a future for Donnie that Donnie couldn't see for himself.\n\n\"Donnie's life was far from easy.\"\n\nBut he always had help. There were so many people who helped Harris through his struggles. So many classmates who helped him along the way.\n\nAnd that final classmate was Myers, who shot straight up in bed at 3 a.m. Dec. 20, hours after learning Harris had died.\n\n\"And it was like, 'I can't do it. I can't watch this go down. I have to do something,'\" Myers said. \"There's no family. I cannot allow this to happen. I can't just witness it.\"\n\nMyers, along with Mark Webster, started rallying their Broad Ripple classmates and alumni, including Bruce Buchanan, the owner of Flanner Buchanan Funeral Centers.\n\n\"Man, I really need your help with something very serious,\u201d Myers told Buchanan on the phone call. He told him the story of Harris and he asked Buchanan, \"Will you join the cause? Can you help?\"\n\nBuchanan's answer was quick and steadfast. \"Count me in.\" Buchanan claimed Harris' body. And Myers, with some encouragement from the Broad Ripple community, started a GoFundMe for funeral expenses, which has garnered more than $10,000.\n\n\"Every individual deserves dignity and respect as the next chapter begins,\" said Myers. \"Donnie deserves the dignity and respect. That story's done. It is behind him. This is his next chapter.\"\n\nFuneral services for Harris are pending.Donate to Harris' funeral expenses.\n\nFollow IndyStar sports reporter Dana Benbow on X: @DanaBenbow.
