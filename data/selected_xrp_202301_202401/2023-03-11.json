        "title": "WOMADelaide 2023 opens day one with a bang - the AU review",
        "content": "After a couple of smaller WOMAD festivals during the COVID pandemic, this year, WOMADelaide is back at full steam and the sold out crowd appreciated it. The mood in the air was one of jubilation and celebration.\n\nThere is just so much to see and do that it is impossible to see it all. Decisions have to be made. Bangarra Dance Theatre or Billy Bragg? Bon Iver or Jyoty? The best thing is, that no matter where you are in the event, there will be something interesting and captivating to take in.\n\nLate in the afternoon, AURORA on stage 2 bears the brunt of the harsh afternoon sun with good humour. Even if she becomes burnt like bacon, she ignores this minor inconvenience and impishly and playfully entertains the audience of mainly young girls. She throws her heart and soul into the performance and captivates the crowd. Meanwhile, near the back of the crowd, Compagnie Didier, from Montpellier, do interpretive dance to AURORA\u2019s music whilst dressed in pink inflatable suits. Surprisingly graceful and funny simultaneously.\n\nThe smaller stages have some hidden gems as well. Constantinople, led by Belgian-Tunisian singer Ghalia Benali are also playful and captivating. The Ripple Effect Band from Maningrida in Arnhem Land, sing fascinating songs from their culture and heritage with contagious energy that has the crowd dancing.\n\nFolk musician Grace Cummings has an adoring crowd at the zoo stage and is clearly enjoying sharing her music. Cimafunnk over at the Foundation stage bought their infectious high energy dance music to the stage, which had the crowd jumping.\n\nThe highlight is French troupe Gratte Ciel feathered angels performance. From atop cranes high in the sky, the angels fly, soar, walk and dance along wires strung high above. Feathers shower down on the audience as oohs and ahhs are heard from every corner of the arena. Something that cannot be fully described and has to be seen to be believed.\n\nThe Bangarra Dance Theatre are no strangers to WOMADelaide, and were fascinating to watch. Their tribal beat-filled dance performance was mesmerising. The troupe worked as one, with each individual movement intrinsically linked with the other.\n\nFor an opening evening of entertainment, this was a delightful taste of what is to come over the next three days."

        "content": "In the latest development series, a former lawyer shared a tweet noting the 5 outcomes in the Ripple vs. SEC case.\n\nThe Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit is almost 2 years old and has not yet reached any conclusion.\n\nThe long-going Ripple vs. SEC case attracted a former lawyer, who shared his 5 outcomes that suggest a possibility in the lawsuit. Scott Chamberlain is a former lawyer and co-founder of Evernode XRPL\u2014 the permissionless Layer 2 platform. On March 10th, Chamberlain shared a tweet in which he wrote, \u201cWith a decision in SEC vs. Ripple seemingly nigh, I thought I\u2019d do the stupid thing and predict 5 outcomes.\u201d\n\nWith a decision in SEC v @Ripple seemingly nigh, I thought I\u2019d do the stupid thing and predict 5 outcomes:\n\n\n\n1. Summary judgement for Chris and Brad \u2013 I don\u2019t think the SEC has anywhere near the evidence to support they knowingly or recklessly sold an unregistered security. \u2014 Scott Chamberlain | \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f \ud83e\ude9d (@scotty2ten) March 10, 2023\n\nIn In 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began a lawsuit against Ripple- a blockchain company. In the case, the SEC alleged that Ripple and its executives illegally sold XRP\u2013 a cryptocurrency, to investors without registering it as a security.\n\n5 Outcomes in Ripple vs. SEC Case\n\nAccording to Chamberlain, his 5 outcomes are as follows.\n\nOutcome 1: Initially, he gave a summary judgment for Chris and Brad, as he \u201cdon\u2019t think the SEC has anywhere near the evidence to support they knowingly or recklessly sold an unregistered security.\u201d\n\nOutcome 2: Chamberlain added a summary judgment for Ripple in Respect of Overseas sales and wrote, \u201cRipple\u2019s sales of XRP on overseas exchanges are not within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. A new precedent would be set to deem those domestic transactions finalized in the US.\u201d\n\nOutcome 3: He also mentioned \u201csummary judgment dismissing the part of the case that asserts XRP itself is a security \u2013 no precedent supports the digital asset itself being a security. This claim was a contrivance for the SEC not to have to prove each sale and to avoid the problem of overseas sales.\u201d\n\nOutcome 4: Chamberlain wrote about his 4th outcome: \u201cWhat proceeds is a limited case about whether any of Ripple\u2019s sales of XRP in the US involved an unregistered investment contract.\u201d\n\nOutcome 5: And lastly, the lawyer mentioned, \u201cBecause of 2 and 3, the case settles. I happen to believe the SEC underestimated that most of Ripple\u2019s sales occurred on overseas exchanges through algorithmic trading. Once overseas and secondary market sales are excluded, there\u2019s insufficient meat left on the bone.\u201d\n\nAlthough, Ripple\u2019s legal team has secured a win in the lawsuit against the financial watchdog as Judge Analisa Torres ruled on both parties\u2019 motions to exclude certain expert witnesses, especially one that both Chamberlain and Ripple\u2019s amicus curiae John E. Deaton found disastrous for the SEC\u2019s argument.\n\nMoreover, another lawsuit against a cryptocurrency business has been filed as New York Attorney General Letitia James sued KuCoin\u2014 a crypto exchange, and accused it of illegally operating as a securities and commodities broker-dealer without registering in the state.\n\nXRP Price Analysis\n\nAccording to Coinmarketcap, at press time, XRP price is $0.363344 with a 24-hour trading volume of $1.24 billion. XRP is up 0.46% in the last 24 hours, with a current market cap of $18.51 billion. It has a circulating supply of 50.95 billion XRP coins and a max. supply of 100 billion XRP coins.\n\nSource: XRP/USD by Coinmarketcap\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational ideas only and do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.
