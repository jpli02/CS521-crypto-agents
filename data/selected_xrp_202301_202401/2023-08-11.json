        "content": "Enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions provider Ripple is among the members of a cross-border payments task force recently formed by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\n\nAs part of the cross-border payments interoperability and extension task force, Ripple will work with other organizations, including Mastercard and SWIFT, in fulfilling BIS\u2019 goal to \u201cenhance cross-border payments and meet the quantitative targets for cross-border payments endorsed by the G20,\u201d Cointelegraph reported Thursday (Aug. 10).\n\nTo that end, BIS will be working to improve access to payment systems, extend operating hours of payments systems and create links between different payment systems, according to the report.\n\nBIS said that improvements to payment systems require global coordination and cooperation between stakeholders in both the public and private sectors.\n\nCross-border transactions are growing rapidly, thanks to digital transformations and new international settlement rails, but a host of international payment frustrations and reconciliation frictions still exist.\n\nPYMNTS research has found that just 23% of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) found that their current cross-border payment solutions are very or extremely satisfactory.\n\nIn addition, 27% of SMBs see the complexity of cross-border payments as a hindrance to their ability to grow, according to \u201cInternational B2B Payments: A Guide for Entrepreneurs and Digital Businesses,\u201d a PYMNTS and Payoneer collaboration.\n\nThe report also found that 38% of SMBs reported increased cross-border payments sent or received. This is driven by the fact that local entrepreneurs can now develop a clientele worldwide as easily as they can within their own cities.\n\nBlockchain and digital asset technology promise faster, more affordable, transparent payment methods, as well as the ability to offer new financial services to customers and tap into new revenue streams, and they will underpin the future of financial infrastructure, Aaron Sears, managing director of the Americas at Ripple, told PYMNTS in an interview posted in June.\n\nNowhere is this truer than within the $156 trillion cross-border payments market, Sears said at the time.\n\n\u201cThe primary pain points are around speed, reliability, transparency and cost,\u201d Sears said.\n\nWith blockchain and crypto-enabled payments, on the other hand, value is transferred instantaneously, enabling real-time settlement and payout, Sears said. Cross-border payments powered by these technologies can be made on demand, 24/7/365."

        "content": "Riana Pfefferkorn is a lawyer-turned-research scholar at Stanford University in the U.S.A. She sat down with us for a Q&A about encryption, protecting kids online, and the ripple effects of misguided legislation. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nQ: Tell us more about your work on encryption.\n\nA: I try to study and analyze bills that might\u2014either overtly or covertly\u2014have a negative impact on the availability of strong encryption that has no back doors or other intentional weaknesses in it. This applies to both devices and communications.\n\n\n\nAfter spending time in private practice as a lawyer working on a lot of online consumer privacy issues, I developed an interest in the intersection of technology, law, and civil liberties. Being at Stanford enables me to work at that intersection.\n\nMy work since coming to Stanford has tried to focus on encryption policy, which has continually been under threat from around the world.\n\nQ: Why is it so important to be scrutinizing bills that affect encryption?\n\nA: We\u2019re in a place where almost all traffic on the web is encrypted. It\u2019s terrific. That said, it\u2019s kind of a whack-a-mole job trying to keep track of the bills that still threaten an open, free, and secure Internet in different parts of the world at a given time.\n\nQ: Which bills are you concerned about right now? Why?\n\nA: In the U.S., it\u2019s the STOP CSAM Act and the Kids Online Safety Act. It\u2019s the ongoing debates over child sex abuse regulation in the European Union. And finally, it\u2019s the Online Safety Bill in the UK.\n\nThe biggest threat is democratic governments around the world using child safety as a rationale for proposing legislation that could very easily have the effect of making it illegal to offer strong end-to-end encryption to users in those jurisdictions\u2014and by consequence, potentially in other jurisdictions as well.\n\nQ: Why should people pay attention to bills in countries other than their own?\n\nA: Anything that happens with regulation that affects encryption in one country will affect other countries because of the nature of the Internet. It\u2019s international.\n\n\n\nThese companies that provide these services are not confined to the market of just one country, and so, what they are required to do in any given nation will affect how they provide service in other countries.\n\nQ: What\u2019s an example of a ripple effect?\n\nA: You know, I think, one of the most troubling tendencies that we see is that the calls for reduction to a strong encryption, or to take other measures that undermine the security and privacy and openness of the Internet, are now coming largely from Western democracies, such as the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nThat provides cover to more authoritarian regimes and places like China and Russia to propose the same and gives very little standing to democracies to try and distinguish themselves, because they say: \u201cWell, those guys are doing it.\u201d\n\nQ: What can people to do defend encryption?\n\nA: If you\u2019re someone from a technical or policy background, it could be about highlighting to the people you love that the privacy and protection afforded to them is under attack by their own legislators.\n\nMany societies have connected every function of society to the Internet, so data and privacy and data security are a fundamental need.\n\nIt\u2019s not simply a question of individuals just exercising their personal rights to privacy. It\u2019s an economic issue. It\u2019s a national security issue.\n\nLearn more about why encryption is the best tool we have for keeping ourselves safe online.\n\nImage copyright: \u00a9Unsplash"

        "title": "The SEC is vying for a Ripple appeal. Here's what to watch out for - Blockworks",
        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission said it plans to challenge a federal judge\u2019s ruling that certain XRP token offerings and sales did not violate securities laws. It\u2019s an attempt to preserve its power over regulating the crypto industry, legal experts say.\n\nAccording to a new letter to Judge Analisa Torres, the SEC wants to overturn two rulings: that programmatic sales of XRP and Ripple\u2019s distribution of XRP tokens in exchange for labor and services are not securities offerings or sales.\n\n\u201cJudge Torres\u2019 conclusions that digital assets such as cryptocurrency tokens are not themselves securities could severely limit the SEC\u2019s ability to apply regulations to platforms that custody or facilitate transfers or exchanges of digital assets,\u201d said Jeffrey Alberts, a partner at Pryor Cashman.\n\nThe SEC is asking to delay the pretrial proceedings and trial pending the resolution of the appeal.\n\nThe agency said a timely appeal is essential as it could impact other pending enforcement actions and there is already a demonstrated disagreement between federal judges, as seen in a recent opinion handed down in the SEC v. Terraform Labs case.\n\n\u201cThese two issues involve controlling questions of law on which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion, as reflected by an intra-district split that has already developed,\u201d the SEC wrote in Wednesday\u2019s letter.\n\nIn the Terraform Labs case, a federal judge in the same district as Judge Torres denied Terraform\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds that all sales of Terraform tokens contributed to building the blockchain and profit for holders. A key reason for Torres to rule that programmatic sales of XRP were not securities was that buyers were \u201cnot investing money in Ripple at all,\u201d per the summary judgment.\n\nTorres\u2019 summary judgment did not address secondary sales, but her reasoning could potentially limit the SEC\u2019s ability to regulate crypto exchanges and other platforms that facilitate trades, Alberts said.\n\n\u201cThe most interesting part of Judge Torres\u2019 decision for the wider crypto industry is her finding that XRP itself was not a security when not wrapped in an investment contract \u2014 just as the oranges in Howey are just oranges when the investment contract falls away \u2014 and the implication that has for secondary market transactions,\u201d Philip Moustakis, a partner at Seward & Kissel, said.\n\nThe legal battle between the SEC and Ripple and two of its former and current executives is far from over. Also on Wednesday, Torres issued a scheduling order for the trial, which should take place during the second quarter of 2024. As such, the SEC is seeking interlocutory review, which is an appeal issued before a final judgment is handed down.\n\nAn appeal of the programmatic sales ruling could impact the charges against Ripple\u2019s founder and former CEO Christian Larsen and current CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who are alleged to have aided and abetted in securities law violations. As of now, their liability is set to be determined at the jury trial.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC\u2019s appeal is successful in expanding the categories of XRP sales constituting securities violations, it likely would increase the potential liability of Garlinghouse and Larsen for aiding and abetting those violations,\u201d Alberts said.\n\nThe SEC also noted that the remedies phase, during which the fines and other penalties Ripple and/or the other defendants are subject to, is likely to bring up an \u201carray\u201d of additional factual and legal issues. The SEC is also inclined to seek remedies from Ripple on the alleged $3 billion in net XRP sales that have been conducted since the initial complaint was filed.\n\nRipple must respond to the SEC\u2019s letter by August 16. The SEC said it hopes to file its appeal opening brief two days later, should it receive the court\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cThe SEC does not have the \u201cright\u201d to appeal just yet, which is why they are asking permission to file an \u2018interlocutory\u2019 appeal,\u201d Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said in a tweet Wednesday. \u201cRipple will file its response with the Court next week.

        "title": "A Ripple of Doubt | Insights - Holland & Knight",
        "content": "In an Aug. 9, 2023, letter to Judge Analisa Torres, the SEC alerted the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) \u2013 and the crypto industry writ large \u2013 of its intent to seek leave to file an interlocutory appeal of the court's recent grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Ripple Labs Inc.\n\nSpecifically, the SEC wants a change to persuade the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \u2013 now, not later \u2013 of its view that Torres got it wrong when she determined that the company's offer and sale of its XRP token over crypto trading platforms, and distributions of XRP in exchange for labor and services, did not involve investment contract securities under the Howey doctrine.1 And the SEC now has a new opinion at its disposal to support its argument.\n\nProcedural Status of the Case\n\nAs we've discussed in other posts, SEC v. Ripple Labs, Inc., et al. is one of the most closely watched crypto cases to date given its key question of whether XRP tokens, or the transactions through which they are offered and sold, constitute securities and thus come within the SEC's enforcement reach. Filed in December 2020, the case has made headlines for a number of reasons, including the defendants' unsuccessful efforts to secure early dismissal of the case and the parties' discovery fights thereafter.\n\nMost recently, following the close of discovery, the parties filed, and on July 13, 2023, the Southern District of New York decided, cross motions for summary judgment. In her ruling, Torres delivered partial victories \u2013 and partial losses \u2013 to both sides. For its part, the SEC has alleged that all of the various transactions by which XRP tokens were distributed constituted securities transactions. Not so, concluded the court when it granted summary judgment in the company's favor, determining that the XRP token is not, in and of itself, a security, and that sales over trading platforms and distributions of the token as consideration for labor and services did not involve investment contracts under Howey. Following the court's decisions on the parties' respective summary judgment motions, it directed the clerk to set the case for trial.\n\nPurpose of an Interlocutory Appeal\n\nThe SEC's letter seeking leave to move for an interlocutory appeal followed soon after the court ruled on the summary judgment motions. Simply put, an interlocutory appeal occurs when litigation is still ongoing and no final judgment has been entered, but one or more parties want to challenge and reverse an order from the trial court deciding an issue in the case. The SEC's challenge would focus on whether platform-based transactions and other distributions of XRP were securities transactions.\n\nParties are not guaranteed the right to an interlocutory appeal and must persuade the court why such a step is necessary. Here, the SEC argues that such an appeal is necessary and appropriate because:\n\nthe two determinations it seeks to appeal involve \"controlling questions of law on which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion, as reflected by an intra-district split that has already developed\" between the Ripple Labs decision and a decision just 18 days later by Judge Jed Rakoff \u2013 also of the SDNY \u2013 deciding in SEC v. Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd. 2 that platform-based sales did comprise securities (and \"reject[ing] the approach recently adopted\" in Ripple Labs)\n\nthat platform-based sales did comprise securities (and \"reject[ing] the approach recently adopted\" in Ripple Labs) there are numerous actions currently pending and \"the Order's rulings are of particular consequence to an issue of programmatic concern to the SEC's enforcement of the securities laws and potentially to a large number of pending litigations\"\n\ninterlocutory review would permit the court and the parties to avoid piecemeal litigation and the possibility of two trials and two remedies phases (assuming the SEC prevailed)\n\nAn Intra-District Split\n\nPerhaps chief among its bases for arguing why an appeal is needed now, the SEC points to a decision from another SDNY court expressly rejecting, in part, the finding in Ripple Labs \u2013 a possibility we predicted could occur following the original ruling.\n\nIn Terraform Labs, the SEC charged the company and its founder Do Keyong Kwon with five counts of securities fraud relating to sales of a stablecoin called the UST coin, a companion coin called LUNA and three other related crypto assets. The charges included fraud under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, control person liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and the unregistered sale of securities and security-based swaps under Section 5 of the Securities Act.\n\nIn his July 31, 2023, opinion, Rakoff denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, a dispositive motion that occurs before fact discovery, whereas summary judgment motions seek a ruling after fact discovery concludes. The court found that the allegations in the SEC's amended complaint, which the court was required to accept as true at the motion dismiss stage, were sufficient to survive dismissal and that the SEC alleged sufficient facts that, if later proven to be true, would demonstrate the digital assets sold by Terraform qualified as \"investment contracts\" under Howey.3 Notably, the court cited and rejected Torres' approach that distinguished sales to institutional purchasers from sales through the secondary market to anonymous purchasers, declining \"to draw a distinction between these coins based on their manner of sale.\" Instead, Rakoff found that:\n\nHowey makes no such distinction between purchasers. And it makes good sense that it did not. That a purchaser bought the coins directly from the defendants or, instead, in a secondary resale transaction has no impact on whether a reasonable individual would objectively view the defendants' actions and statements as evincing a promise of profits based on their efforts.4\n\nMore to Come\n\nThe SEC needs the court's permission to file a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal. Per the court's practices, the defendants have until Aug. 16, 2023, to submit a letter in opposition to the SEC's Aug. 9, 2023, pre-motion letter. If the court grants the SEC's request to file a motion, the SEC has proposed a briefing schedule whereby it would file its motion on Aug. 18, 2023, then the defendants' opposition brief would be due on Sept. 1, 2023, and the SEC's reply brief would be due on Sept. 8, 2023. The court may accept (or reject) that schedule or impose its own.\n\nThe SECond Opinions Blog will be watching and provide updates. If you need additional information on this topic \u2013 or any topic related to securities enforcement or investigations \u2013 please contact the authors or other members of Holland & Knight's Securities Enforcement Defense Team.\n\nNotes\n\n1 SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946).\n\n2 No. 23-cv-1346, 2023 WL 4858299 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2023).\n\n3 The court also rejected the defendants' other arguments. First, the defendants relied on the Major Questions Doctrine, which the court found did not apply because \"the cryptocurrency industry \u2013 though certainly important \u2013 falls far short of being a portion of the American economy bearing vast economic and political significance.\" Terraform, 2023 WL 4858299, at *8. Next, the court rejected the defendants' fair notice argument under the Due Process Clause, finding that a reasonable person operating within the crypto industry would have fair notice that their conduct might prompt an SEC enforcement action due to the SEC's activities in the crypto space to date, including written guidance and other enforcement actions and litigation. Id. at *9. Finally, the court declined to credit the defendants' argument under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), finding that the SEC simply was enforcing its existing views that certain digital assets are securities and not imposing any new policy such that the APA was not triggered. Id. at *10.\n\n4 Terraform, 2023 WL 4858299, at *15."
