        "title": "XRP Holders on Edge as Ripple Lawyer Leaves Amid SEC Lawsuit - Crypto Times",
        "content": "The company behind the XRP cryptocurrency, Ripple, has suffered a setback in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as one of its attorneys, Kylie Chiseul Kim, has resigned from the case.\n\nKim, who joined Ripple\u2019s legal team in July 2022, filed a letter in the Southern District of New York on May 24, 2023, stating that she would no longer be associated with Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, P.L.L.C., the law firm representing Ripple. She did not give any reason for her departure.\n\nKim\u2019s exit comes at a critical juncture in the lawsuit, which was initiated by the SEC in December 2020. The regulator accused Ripple and its current and former CEOs, Brad Garlinghouseformat=png&nam and Chris Larsen, of raising over $1.3 billion in unregistered securities offerings of XRP since 2012.\n\nRipple has denied the allegations and argued that XRP is not a security but a digital asset that facilitates cross-border payments. The company has also claimed that the SEC failed to provide fair notice to the market about its position on XRP and that the agency\u2019s actions have harmed millions of XRP holders.\n\nThe lawsuit has attracted widespread attention from the crypto community as it could have significant implications for the future of digital assets in the U.S. Many XRP holders have intervened in the case as third-party defendants, seeking to protect their interests and rights.\n\nHinman documents, which relate to a 2018 speech given by former SEC director William Hinman. In his speech, Hinman stated that Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was not a security due to its decentralized nature.\n\nRipple hopes that these documents will prove that the SEC had a similar view on XRP or at least did not have a clear stance on its status. The court has ordered the SEC to produce these documents by June 2023."

        "content": "Ripple Labs Inc. has filed a trademark application that suggests \u201cRLUSD\u201d as the ticker for its upcoming dollar-based stablecoin. This development comes amid growing anticipation within the XRP community regarding the company\u2019s new financial product, which aims to integrate seamlessly with On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), recently rebranded as Ripple Payments.\n\nDetails On Ripple\u2019s RLUSD Trademark Filing\n\nAccording to details from Justia Trademarks, the filing, identified under serial number 98537677, was made on May 7, 2024. This application is still in the early stages of processing, listed under the status \u201c630 \u2013 New Application \u2013 Record Initialized Not Assigned To Examiner.\u201d The attorney of record for this filing is Olivia Maria Baratta from Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP.\n\nThe filing specifies a broad range of financial services tied to this trademark, which include but are not limited to \u201cmonetary services for receiving and disbursing payments and gifts in virtual and digital currency and digital tokens of value determined by fiat currency over a computer network.\u201d Moreover, the application covers \u201cfinancial management and administration services, such as facilitating transfers of digital currency and electronic transmission of digital currency.\u201d\n\nThis move by Ripple marks a significant step towards launching its stablecoin, which had been hinted at earlier this year. In April 2024, the company had expressed its intentions to delve into the stablecoin market, a strategic pivot aiming to harness a market sector that is projected to burgeon to a near $3 trillion valuation in the upcoming years.\n\nThe choice of RLUSD as a ticker symbol appears to be a tactical decision, influenced by the preoccupation of other potential tickers such as USDX and USDR by other entities. Flare Networks has already introduced USDX as a stablecoin on its blockchain platform, while USDR is currently utilized by Real USD. These circumstances presumably led Ripple to settle on the designation of RLUSD for its stablecoin initiative.\n\nWhile the formal launch and full details of the stablecoin are still forthcoming, the trademark filing marks another major step for Ripple\u2019s broad vision for a full-service crypto company. The company has yet to issue an official statement regarding the detailed features and launch timeline for RLUSD.\n\nAs previously revealed, the primary motivation for introducing a stablecoin and integrating it with its payment platform is to enhance its Ripple Payments solution for cross-border transactions. The stablecoin will enable US based customers to leverage stablecoin for international payments through Ripple Payments, as an alternative to using XRP.\n\n\u201cI see stablecoins as a complement or even an accelerant to what Ripple\u2019s doing at its core,\u201d Garlinghouse remarked during a recent interview with the CEO of SCB 10X.\n\nAt press time, XRP traded at 0.53379.\n\nFeatured image from Knowledge Innovations, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse says that the firm\u2019s court case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will conclude in the near future.\n\nIn December 2020, Ripple was sued by the SEC on the grounds of allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security.\n\nDuring an interview with Tai Panich, the CEO of SCB 10X, a technology investment firm, Garlinghouse expressed his belief that Ripple\u2019s success in the ongoing lawsuit will have significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Based on recent developments relating to the SEC\u2019s former Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman and his speech declaring Ethereum (ETH) a non-security, Garlinghouse says he expects a court decision in weeks, rather than months.\n\n\u201cIn terms of where things stand today \u2013 I\u2019ll try to not get too much into the legal weeds \u2013 you are right that I feel very confident that we\u2019ll see a decision from the courts this year. In fact, I think I would guess that it will be in weeks, not months. There were some decisions that happened last week that you may have read about. The judge ruled against the SEC\u2019s effort to redact certain information, a very kind of infamous speech that the then Director of Corporate Finance Bill Hinman gave, talking about why ETH, in his view, is not a security.\n\nThe court just ruled last week that the notes in the emails associated with that are going to be made public, and should be public around June 13th. So I think that\u2019s a huge win for transparency. But what it really calls out is, there really hasn\u2019t been clarity, despite calls and demands from leaders across the crypto industry.\u201d\n\nThe Ripple CEO remains committed to completing the fight but acknowledges that the ongoing conflict with the SEC and the absence of clear regulations in the US have resulted in many industry players relocating or outsourcing.\n\n\u201cRipple decided to lean in and fight this fight, both for Ripple and the whole industry. We\u2019ve spent a lot of money defending it. And I think what we\u2019ve called out is the government in the United States, and the SEC particularly, is putting politics ahead of smart policy. Because of that, you\u2019re seeing entrepreneurs going overseas, you\u2019re seeing companies like Ripple \u2013 most of our hiring is non-US now. Most of our customers\u2026 are non-US. I think it\u2019s kind of to be expected that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
