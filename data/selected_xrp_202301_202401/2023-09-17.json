        "content": "There\u2019s been an interesting ongoing discussion among XRP aficionados on Twitter lately, with some laying arguments as to what the future of Ripple should look like so that it supports the company\u2019s vision, as well as that of XRP holders.\n\nA community member, Yassin Mobarak, took it to X to comment:\n\nI\u2019m sensing Ripple is shifting from reliance on XRP in cross-border payments to new use cases such as institutional custody of digital assets, derivatives, CBDCs, and carbon credit markets. Not saying that\u2019s a bad strategy at all, but in order for XRP to prosper long-term, we cannot rely on just Ripple.\n\nIndeed, there have been multiple announcements recently related to Ripple. Just a few days ago, the company expanded its liquidity hub to two new countries \u2013 Brazil and Australia.\n\nBefore that, Ripple made headlines by revealing an acquisition of the well-known crypto-focused financial institution called Fortress Trust.\n\nCommenting on the matter was also a popular blockchain analyst, who said:\n\nWe cannot rely on Ripple. It\u2019s the builders we should be focusing on. XRP ecosystem has approximately 1000 projects according to Ripple Markus Infanger at Apex. We need 100,000 active projects to even get close to ETH. If you love to focus on Ripple, shop for private equity that is sold on more than dozen platforms with competitive prices.\n\nIn essence, the expert argues that there\u2019s a long way ahead if Ripple is to catch up to Ethereum in terms of development, but this in itself brought up another interesting argument by another user, who said:\n\nXRPL is not a SC-centered chain, you don\u2019t need to keep acting like it is. Different use cases will create a different value."

        "content": "Brad Garlinghouse says XRP could be the next Bitcoin if \u201cwe solve a multi-trillion-dollar problem.\"\n\nThe CEO says Ripple has been working with regulators and regulated institutions like banks all along where there is regulatory clarity.\n\nThe allure of XRP, like XLM, is that countries use it for cross-border payments.\n\nXRP is the next Bitcoin if we solve a multi-trillion-dollar problem, as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said during an interview with Bloomberg. The remittance token has been a popular topic since Ripple secured a victory in court against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when Judge Annalisa Torres determined that XRP is a security only when sold to institutional clients. The ruling, though only partial, provided some level of clarity for the payments token.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple records landmark win against the SEC as court rules XRP is not a security except...\n\nXRP may be the next Bitcoin\n\nRipple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse says XRP could be the next Bitcoin, as it has a strong competitive edge over its peers in the crypto sector. Specifically, he says, \u201cFrom the get-go, Ripple has worked with regulators and regulated institutions like banks,\u201d In his opinion, the digital asset\u2019s exposure to a space where there is no regulatory uncertainty, such as the traditional finance sector (TradFi) is in itself a competitive advantage, increasing the chances of the token\u2019s success long term.\n\nAs such, Garlinghouse articulates that with XRP at the core of what Ripple wants to do, it is working to solve some of the original problems that Bitcoin (BTC) set out to solve, which is expected to map out the next generation of digital assets. It comes as RippleNet takes on the SWIFT messaging system in an innovative attempt to solve the nature of a payment taking days to settle instead of seconds.\n\nThe innovation currently boasts over 100 customers, according to Garlinghouse, \u201cranging from some of the biggest banks in the world to payment providers, to the Western Union and MoneyGram,\u201d among others, with Garlinghouse noting that they are signing up more than a bank every week.\n\nDecrease in cost, increase in speed\n\nThe allure of XRP, like XLM, is that countries use it for cross-border payments, unlike tokens used to manipulate the market. Garlinghouse notes that XRP is at the helm of digital asset maturity, providing real value to customers by solving real problems. More broadly, he says, \u201cXRP is 1000X faster than Bitcoin, which means the volatility risk taken around XRP is only for three seconds.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock rumors of shifted focus from Bitcoin to XRP fail to deflate BTC Spot ETF flare."

        "content": "Over the last few months, there have been a number of XRP price predictions that have taken the crypto market by surprise. While some of these have looked to be attainable, others have carried price ranges that seem impossible for the current vantage point. A\n\ns a result of community members questioning what Ripple can do about these predictions, Ripple CTO David Schwartz has come forward to explain why the company is not debunking the predictions.\n\nRipple CTO Says It\u2019s Hard\n\nAn X (formerly Twitter) user drew the attention of the Ripple CTO toward the numerous XRP price predictions that have been making the rounds on social media. The X user who goes by Darkhorse called out Ripple and its founders for not debunking these outrageous price predictions that have gone as high as $50,000, saying that \u201cRipple have let people suffer, while Ripple founders hit the rich list & post $2m porches.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading\n\nIncoming Milestone Could Be Very Bullish For XRP Price, Here\u2019s Why 8 months ago\n\nTo round off the post, Darkhorse explained that they could\u2019ve easily debunked these XRP price predictions to prevent this. \u201cWould of taken 1 post to correct the BS just 1,\u201d the user said.\n\nSchwartz who was mentioned in the tweet responded to Darkhorse\u2019s complaints to explain why the crypto firm has not necessarily come forward to debunk the XRP price predictions. He starts out by saying that while he understands how the user felt, \u201cit\u2019s a lot harder than you think.\u201d\n\nThe Ripple CTO explains that debunking everything could open up a chance that the company ends up debunking something that actually turns out to be true. He further added; \u201cIf we call out everything we know is false, we\u2019ll be seen to be enforcing things we don\u2019t know aren\u2019t fake because we won\u2019t can them out.\u201d\n\nLastly, the CTO points to the possibility of legal risks arising from trying to debunk all of the price predictions.\n\nI completely understand why you feel this way, I do sometimes too. But it\u2019s a lot harder than you think. We don\u2019t know everything, and even a small chance we \u201cdebunk\u201d something true is worrisome. If we call out everything we know is false, we\u2019ll be seen to be enforcing things we\u2026 \u2014 David \u201cJoelKatz\u201d Schwartz (@JoelKatz) September 17, 2023\n\nXRP Price Predictions Are Still Rampant\n\nThe XRP price predictions are still coming in hot over the last few weeks. Some of the most notable ones include the $10,000 forecast put forward by an analyst who goes by Lord XRP on X (formerly Twitter). The prediction follows one from a Wells Fargo Manager placing the XRP price at $500.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCoinbase\u2019s BASE Shows Teeth As TVL Nears Solana 8 months ago\n\nBoth of these price predictions actually follow the expectation that Ripple will begin to capture a larger share of the payments market. When this happens, the analysts expect the XRP price to rise exponentially as a result of the share of the market cap commanded by Ripple.\n\nSmaller price predictions have also included a predicted run to $130 by pseudonymous crypto analyst XRP Captain. However, the appearance of a death cross in the price trend over the last few days suggests none of these predictions would be happening anytime soon.\n\nToken price holding $0.5 support | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "Ripple vs. SEC: Factors At Play That Could Guarantee A Settlement | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Prominent figures in the crypto community have continued to give their takes on why and how a settlement between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission is likely to happen. This time around, Crypto influencer Zach Rector has stated why he believes a \u201csettlement is guaranteed.\u201d\n\nRipple And SEC Guaranteed To Settle\n\nIn a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Rector stated that both parties are \u201c100%\u201d likely to settle before the case goes to trial as the SEC won\u2019t want Ripple to call witnesses like the \u201cEthereum ICO Insider\u201d Steven Nerayoff. This is because Nerayoff recently came forward to detail how Ethereum got preferential treatment during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nAccording To Rector, Nerayoff\u2019s claims vindicate members of the XRP community who had postulated the \u2018Ethereum Free Pass\u2019 theory. This theory is based on the premise that key SEC figures had ties to Ethereum, and that was why the cryptocurrency didn\u2019t face any regulatory scrutiny like the one Ripple is facing despite running the world\u2019s first ICO.\n\nFor one, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which was founded in 2017, had Simpson Tha Cher & Bartlett as one of its members, and this was the firm that former SEC Director William Hinman worked for before he joined the SEC. This may have influenced Hinman to give his famous speech where he stated that Ether was not a security.\n\nThere is also the belief that the SEC may have targeted Ripple at the time because XRP was a direct competitor to ETH, with both tokens occupying the position of 2nd and 3rd largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nWith key witnesses like Nerayoff, Rector believes Ripple is well-positioned not only to win but also to destroy the SEC\u2019s credibility (something which the SEC will be looking to avoid). As such, the SEC will be looking to settle before the case goes to trial.\n\nThis position is also similar to when pro-XRP legal expert Fred Rispoli mentioned that the SEC won\u2019t want to drag Ripple\u2019s founders through a trial as there is the likelihood of former SEC Chair Jay Clayton and former SEC Director William Hinman being called to the witness stand. He reasoned that statements from this duo could bring the SEC\u2019s credibility into question.\n\nWhat Nerayoff Has To Say\n\nSteven Nerayoff happens to have actively participated in Ethereum\u2019s ICO. As such, any testament from him can really hamper the SEC\u2019s case. Interestingly, Nerayoff is believed to be one of those who lobbied the SEC to give Ethereum a regulatory \u2018free pass\u2019 during the period the SEC was clamping down on crypto projects for selling unregistered securities.\n\nOn September 17, Nerayoff released a tweet where he suggested that there were some irregularities in Ethereum\u2019s ICO of which the SEC seems to be directly implicated. He further stated that he \u201cmight\u201d have evidence to prove these irregularities.\n\nMeanwhile, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton stated that Nerayoff\u2019s statement clearly proves that the \u2018Ethereum Free Pass\u2019 isn\u2019t a myth and that the only thing that the community had lacked before now, to prove this theory was \u201ca true insider who was there, and knows everything and has the receipts to prove it.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, if Nerayoff truly knows where the \u201cbodies are buried\u201d and has the map \u201cshowing the location,\u201d then things (probably in reference to the SEC vs. Ripple case) are \u201cabout to get real interesting.\u201d\n\nXRP price recovers above $0.49 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from CoinMarketCap, chart from Tradingview.com"
