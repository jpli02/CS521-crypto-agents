We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Feb. 7, Bank of England (BoE) released a document on the digital version pound of sterling, the U.K.'s digital currency, sharing the link via its Twitter handle. Curiously, it has mentioned Ripple in it, although without naming XRP.\n\nToday the Bank of England and @hmtreasury have published a Consultation Paper on the digital pound, a UK central bank digital currency. Find out more here: https://t.co/jISyz0kvtb pic.twitter.com/KhYOY0Dlaz \u2014 Bank of England (@bankofengland) February 7, 2023\n\nBoE is working on CBDC\n\nThus, the Bank of England and the U.K. Treasury are planning to create a CBDC, the digital pound. They hope users can begin benefiting from its users by the end of the decade as that would push out banknotes and coins from circulation. They would conduct payments using their smartphones.\n\nThe BoE also wants to keep its CBDC from being created by a private Big Tech company, so that these CBDC payments do not end up within only a closed, private network.\n\nTo protect the U.K.'s financial system from becoming unstable as the CBDC would be introduced, Parliament decided to limit the number of digital pounds stored within a single wallet even if this would reduce the efficiency of the pound as a means of payment.\n\nHowever, the final decision on whether to go on with these plans will be made in 2025.\n\nRipple gets mention, here's what it is about\n\nBoE's consultation paper mentions Ripple crypto giant. It mentioned that the bank and Ripple have a \"joint project\" with Ripple, which is about synchronized FX transfers located in two different simulated RTGS systems.\n\nWhat's more, according to the paper, this is included in the BoE's Real Time Gross Settlement Renewal Programme at the moment.\n\nAs a reminder, back in 2017, the Bank of England's Fintech Accelerator chose Ripple as a partner to perform a PoC (proof-of-concept) with the DLT behemoth to work on transnational payments and settlements between two different Real Time Gross Settlement systems.\n\nImage via Bank of England\n\nRipple seeks engineer for CBDC projects\n\nAs reported by U.Today, blockchain behemoth Ripple is now in search of an engineer intern for its projects related to central bank digital currencies.\n\nThe person hired by Ripple will be dealing with creating prototype software on the basis of Ripple's private CBDC Ledger powered by XRPL.\n\nIn September 2021, Ripple partnered with the central bank of Bhutan to help them build their own centralized digital currency, dubbed Ngultrum.\n\nIn March of the same year, the company released a white paper that explained how XRP Ledger could be used for building central bank digital currencies.\n\nAs reported by U.Today in late January, pro-Ripple attorney Jeremy Hogan shared several possible ways that XRP Ledger could be used by central banks for creating CBDCs."

        "title": "Bank Of England Mentions Ripple In CBDC Consultation Paper - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Yesterday, the Bank of England and the UK Treasury published a consultation paper on the digital pound, a U.K. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) \u2013 mentioning Ripple\u2019s technology at one point. In the 116-page document, the Central Bank of England describes why it is considering launching it and what the CBDC might look like.\n\nThis year, the Central Bank of England wants to gather public opinion through a consultation. If the decision is made in favor of a digital pound, it would be implemented in the second half of the decade. However, cash would remain in circulation and the CBDC would only serve as a supplement.\n\nThe digital pound would be for everyday payments by households and businesses and would be stored directly at the Bank of England, but users would access it through digital wallets offered by private companies.\n\nHow Is Ripple Involved In The CBDC Of England?\n\nWhat role Ripple will play in the project is relatively unclear at this time. However, the U.S. company is mentioned in the consultation paper under the heading \u201cEnable private sector innovation\u201d and in connection with RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement).\n\nThe report states that as part of the RTGS renewal program, the central bank is focusing on developing a roadmap for continuous improvement of the RTGS service in line with industry feedback and incorporating elements from previous feasibility studies and experiments.\n\nIn reference to this, the Bank of England cites two projects: a DLT proof of concept on which it worked with Baton Systems, Clearmatics Technologies Ltd, R3 and Token, and a cross-border synchronization project. This is where Ripple comes in:\n\nCross-border Synchronisation: a joint project with Ripple demonstrating that synchronised FX transactions in two different simulated RTGS systems can be achieved, leading to the incorporation of synchronisation functionality into the roadmap for renewal.\n\nFurthermore, the central bank states that it has been working with industry to develop new strategies and structures so that the benefits of innovative technologies can be enjoyed by new types of private sector companies. For example, in 2017, the BoE expanded access by allowing non-bank payment service providers to apply for an RTGS settlement account.\n\nIn 2021, the Bank introduced its omnibus account policy, which allows payment system operators to fund their participants\u2019 balances with central bank money. And going forward, the Bank of England intends to continue to encourage innovation:\n\nThe Bank continues to engage with private sector firms to understand potential new models of wholesale settlement and how these can be supported going forward.\n\nWhether this also refers to Ripple can only be speculated. In a footnote to its Ripple mention, the Bank of England refers to its website and the Ripple proof of concept from 2017.\n\nThere, it is stated that the central bank conducted a proof of concept with Ripple to explore the synchronized movement of two different currencies across two different real-time gross settlement systems connected to Ripple Connect and the Interledger protocol.\n\n\u201cThis engagement concluded upon completion of this proof of concept. We will continue to work with businesses on fintech proofs-of-concepts whenever this may help us fulfill our mission,\u201d the Bank of England website reads.\n\nTherefore, such news as \u201cthe Bank of England will work with Ripple for its CBDC\u201d are definitely premature. Still, the connections between Ripple and the BoE are interesting. As Bitcoinist reported, Ripple is also part of the Digital Pound Foundation, a lobby group that supports the introduction of a digital pound.\n\nAt press time, the XRP price stood at $0.4013, still trading below the crucial 200-day EMA.\n\nFeatured image from julientromeur / Pixabay, Chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Physicists want to use gravitational waves to 'see' the beginning of time - Livescience.com",
        "content": "Ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves could help reveal the secrets at the dawn of time, just moments after the Big Bang, new research suggests. And physicists say they can learn more about these primeval gravitational waves using nuclear fusion reactors here on Earth.\n\nIn a new study, physicists used equations that govern how electromagnetic waves move through plasma inside fusion reactors to create a theoretical model for how gravitational waves and matter interact.\n\nThat, in turn, could reveal a better picture of the earliest moments in time.\n\nMoments after the Big Bang, the universe was permeated by a soup of hot, ultradense primordial plasma that sent powerful gravitational waves rippling out into the cosmos.\n\nThese ancient gravitational waves would have propagated throughout the universe and should still be present today, so the mutual influence that matter and gravitational waves had on each other in the universe's infancy would leave observable traces in both. Working backward from those observable traces could reveal a better picture of that early period.\n\n\"We can't see the early universe directly, but maybe we can see it indirectly if we look at how gravitational waves from that time have affected matter and radiation that we can observe today,\" said Deepen Garg , a graduate student in the Princeton Program in Plasma Physics and lead author of the study, in a statement .\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAn illustration showing waves of space-time rippling away from two colliding neutron stars (Image credit: NASA)\n\nA matter of great gravity\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of general relativity , massive bodies interact gravitationally by deforming space around them, generating ripples in space-time called gravitational waves that travel at the speed of light.\n\nUntil now, physicists have used detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) to hunt gravitational waves born in the collisions of black holes . These cosmic cataclysms generate the most powerful gravitational waves, and they travel from the collision region to Earth in a vacuum, meaning that to describe them, physicists need only model the physics of these ripples in empty space.\n\nHowever, when the universe was in its infancy, huge amounts of matter moved around, generating gravitational waves that had to propagate through a primordial plasma, which would have interacted with the waves, altering their shape and trajectory.\n\nTo calculate how this primordial plasma would have affected these ancient gravitational waves, Garg and his supervisor Ilya Dodin carefully analyzed the equations of Einstein's theory of relativity, which describes how the geometry of space changes as matter moves through it. Under certain simplifying assumptions about the physical properties of matter, they could calculate how gravitational waves and matter affect each other.\n\nThe team based part of their equations on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in plasma. This process not only occurs under the surface of stars, but also in fusion reactors on Earth.\n\n\"We basically put plasma wave machinery to work on a gravitational wave problem,\" Garg said.\n\nAlthough scientists have taken an important step toward computing the measurable effects that gravitational waves and primordial plasma may have had on each other, they still have a lot of work to do. The scientists still need to make more accurate and detailed calculations in order to get a better picture of what these ancient gravitational waves would look like today.\n\n\"We have some formulas now, but getting meaningful results will take more work,\" concluded Garg."

        "title": "Kyrie Irving\u2019s trade causes ripple effect across the NBA - CNN",
        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSome NBA trades are simple transactions. One team gets this player or draft picks and in return, the other franchise gets a player, or players, or draft capital.\n\nBut other NBA trades have a ripple effect across the league, impacting a multitude of teams in perhaps unusual ways.\n\nThis looks to be the case for the recent trade of Kyrie Irving who, earlier this week, was moved from the Brooklyn Nets to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nIn compensation, the Nets received guard Spencer Dinwiddie, forward Dorian Finney-Smith and three draft picks. The Nets also sent big man Markieff Morris to Dallas in the trade.\n\nAt first glance, Dallas gets an extra offensive weapon and Brooklyn shifts a wantaway star, but look closer and Irving\u2019s trade doesn\u2019t only have implications for the Mavs and the Nets: it also most notably impacts the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nSharing the load\n\nLuka Donci\u0107 couldn\u2019t do it all on his own \u2013 try as he might.\n\nThe Mavs star has almost single-handedly driven the team\u2019s offense this season in absence of any other star players following Jalen Brunson\u2019s departure to the New York Knicks in the offseason.\n\nMany of Donci\u0107\u2019s stats have increased this year \u2013 his points, field goal attempts, field goal percentage and usage (defined as \u201cthe percentage of team plays used by a player when they are on the floor\u201d) have all reached career highs \u2013 it\u2019s as if he\u2019s Dallas\u2019 own Hercules.\n\nDespite all his hard work, the Mavs are just a few games above a .500 winning percentage, facing a stiff test to climb up the Western Conference rankings.\n\nA key problem has been the time when Donci\u0107 hasn\u2019t been on the floor, with no players to handle offensive responsibilities and take some of the load off of the 23-year-old\u2019s shoulders when he\u2019s resting.\n\nDonci\u0107 scores a basket against Wenyen Gabriel of the Los Angeles Lakers on January 12. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nEnter Irving.\n\nThe eight-time NBA All-Star is one of seven NBA players averaging at least 27.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game this season.\n\nOver the years, Irving has shown that when he is on the court, he can handle the offense almost himself. He should make an excellent \u2018Robin\u2019 to Donci\u0107\u2019s \u2018Batman.\u2019\n\nDallas had to give up a lot to get the 30-year-old Irving, but head coach Jason Kidd believes it is a move that allows the squad to challenge for titles.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s won everywhere he\u2019s gone,\u201d Kidd said of Irving. \u201cWe feel like the talent and his abilities to make us better are something that we needed. We feel that getting him is going to help put us in a position to win a championship.\n\n\u201cTo have two starters that are going to start in the All-Star Game for the Mavs is probably a first. It\u2019s exciting. We have to be excited about this opportunity. It\u2019s easy to look at all the talk of the negative. But let\u2019s look at the positive and what he\u2019s done on and off the court and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re approaching it.\u201d\n\nFor Irving himself, it is a chance for a reset, not just on the court.\n\n\u201cI want to be places that I\u2019m celebrated and not just kind of tolerated or just kind of dealt with in a way that makes me feel respected,\u201d he told reporters in his first press conference as a member of the Mavericks.\n\n\u201cAnd there were times during this process in Brooklyn where I felt very disrespected. And my talent, I work extremely hard at what I do, no one ever talks about my work ethic. Everyone talks about what I\u2019m doing off the floor. So I just wanted to change my narrative and write my own story. And now I\u2019m in Dallas, just focus on what I can control.\u201d\n\nIrving has been in the spotlight many times over the last few seasons over off-the-court controversies. Sarah Stier/Getty Images\n\nQuestions\n\nWhen Kevin Durant signed for the Nets, it was meant to be the beginning of a new dynasty.\n\nHe did not play in the 2019/20 season due to an Achilles injury, but when he took to the court, it was alongside longtime friend James Harden and Irving after both had been acquired via free agency and trade.\n\nWith the three of them on the court, the team looked like a real title challenger.\n\nHowever, injuries to Harden and off-court controversies with Irving restricted the trio of stars\u2019 playing time. Eventually, Harden was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers last season.\n\nAt the end of a disappointing 2021/22 season which ended in a convincing first-round playoff loss to the Boston Celtics, Durant requested a trade away from the organization, sensing it was drifting.\n\nBut owner Joe Tsai remained steadfast despite the circling vultures, and Durant rowed back on his request once the organization fired its previous coach, Steve Nash. And once he and Irving both got onto the court \u2013 and new head coach Jacque Vaughn had time to implement his philosophies \u2013 the team surged up the Eastern Conference with Durant playing arguably the best basketball of his career.\n\nEven after Durant suffered a knee injury which would keep him out for multiple weeks, the Nets remained relatively strong behind Irving\u2019s steady play.\n\nSo following Irving\u2019s departure, will other teams come calling for Durant sensing a moment of weakness? Will the two-time NBA champion request to leave again? And if he does, will the Nets enter a full rebuild?\n\nAlthough it leaves Brooklyn restocked in terms of draft assets and rotation players, Durant\u2019s future with the team is arguably up in the air.\n\nDurant's future with the Nets is in the air following the Kyrie Irving trade. Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n\n\u2018Definitely disappointed\u2019\n\nOne of the surprises of Irving\u2019s trade destination was the location and team.\n\nMany had presumed that if he were to leave, he would be reunited with his former Cleveland Cavaliers teammate, LeBron James, with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nJames and Irving previously enjoyed great success playing together in Cleveland between 2014 and 2017, reaching the NBA Finals in all three seasons they were teammates and winning the title in 2016.\n\nAnd with the Lakers languishing at the bottom end of the Western Conference with an unbalanced roster and stars struggling to fit together, rumors linked a move for Irving at the trade deadline as a way for the team to turn its season around. Irving also reportedly favored a move to Los Angeles to be paired with James.\n\nBut the Nets chose not to do business with the Lakers in the end. According to a report from leading NBA journalist Marc Stein, one of Tsai\u2019s \u201cpresumed objectives\u201d was to not trade Irving to the Lakers, which was his \u201cpreferred\u201d destination.\n\nJames said he was \u201cdefinitely disappointed\u201d that the Lakers were unable to acquire Irving.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit here and say I\u2019m not disappointed on not being able to land such a talent,\u201d James told ESPN on Monday. \u201cBut [also] someone that I had great chemistry with and know I got great chemistry with on the floor, that can help you win championships, in my mind, in my eyes.\n\n\u201cBut my focus is shifted now. My focus is shifted back to where it should be and that\u2019s this club now and what we have in the locker room.\u201d\n\nIt leaves the Lakers in a perilous position and needing James and Anthony Davis to play like MVPs just to reach the playoffs in a congested Western Conference. Do they make a move before the deadline to give James another weapon? Or will a frustrating season for the Purple and Gold continue?"
