        "title": "Brad Garlinghouse Reveals Astonishing Facts About SEC And Hinman After Docs Release - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nRipple boss Brad Garlinghouse has taken to Twitter to share a rare video. This time, he was driven to record it after reading Dr. Hinman's emails released by the SEC after the pressure the court put on this regulatory agency.\n\nGarlinghouse revealed several astonishing facts about Dr. Hinman, the SEC and the crypto regulation that the agency seems to be unwilling or incapable of deploying in the U.S.\n\nGarlinghouse admitted that he does not make a video every week, but this week has been a tough one, so he decided to address the crypto community.\n\nShots fired! This is remarkable; Ripple trying the case in the court of public opinion! Pure political pressure. Without direct accusation, Brad points out Hinman \"Received millions of dollars of law firm part of an alliance with others that had a vested interest in the speech. https://t.co/oz5FlYMe3d \u2014 WrathofKahneman \ud83e\ude9d (@WKahneman) June 16, 2023\n\nRipple CEO reveals curious facts about SEC and Hinman\n\nHe mentioned that the documents about Hinman's speech, internal SEC emails and other documents related to it were finally released by the SEC after two years, seven court orders and more than $100 million of legal bills.\n\nGarlinghouse revealed that, according to the above-mentioned documents, the SEC could not agree inside of the agency on the crypto law that should be used for regulating crypto (as to when a token stops being security) and they told Hinman directly that his speech would confuse the public even more.\n\nHe also pointed out that, according to the documents, while he worked for the SEC, \"Hinman received millions of dollars of payments from his law firm, which was part of an alliance with others that had invested interest in this speech.\"\n\nRipple CEO meets with Clayton and Hinman in person\n\nGarlinghouse also drew attention to the fact that it is clear from the documents that the SEC to a high degree has relentlessly pursued enforcement actions against crypto players, \"while professing fake open arms and calls to come in and register\" as it was lying about their so-called guidance all the way through.\n\nThis happened despite, per Garlinghouse, Ripple spending years proactively engaging with the SEC on the subject of crypto regulatory compliance. Garlinghouse personally met with Jay Clayton (the SEC back then, who then initiated the lawsuit against Ripple in 2020 one day before he retired) and William Hinman without any lawyers present to discuss those matters.\n\nRipple CEO and other top executives answered all the questions from the SEC reps, and there was not a single time when Clayton or Hinman suggested to Garlinghouse, per his words, that XRP was a security. Later on, Garlinghouse said, they used the information he revealed to them in private against Ripple in court.\n\nEven after Ripple received a surprise Wells Notice, saying that the SEC was considering suing them for violating the securities laws, the regulator still refused to provide any substance to those allegations, Garlinghouse added.\n\nAnd now, the SEC, he said, is sending those notices to multiple crypto companies in the U.S. and suing them \u2014 Coinbase, Binance among the most recent ones. The SEC wants to kill crypto innovation in the U.S., Ripple CEO concluded."

The event, held at the prestigious FilmHouse Cinemas in Landmark Centre, VI, Lagos on Friday, June 16, 2023, was an evening filled with heartfelt speeches, enthralling performances, and an electric atmosphere.\n\nTaking viewers three decades into the future from the conclusion of the original hit show, Ripples, which aired on NTA in 1993, Ripples: New Generation plunges audiences into a gripping tale following the legacy of the late matriarch, Leslie Dehinde-Philips. The focal point of the story revolves around Doris, a young and extraordinary woman, who finds herself on the precipice of inheriting the immense Dehinde-Phillips fortune, including a staggering 75% share of DP Oil. Raised to assume the position of Chief Executive Officer, Doris appears destined for greatness. Yet, beneath her picture-perfect life, she longs for an intangible aspiration \u2013 freedom.\n\nRegrettably, Doris\u2019s dreams of liberation are abruptly shattered when a dramatic protest against DP Oil, spearheaded by the Elders of a Niger Delta Community, erupts. Determined to extricate herself from the predicament and pursue her desires, Doris unwittingly falls prey to the clutches of a ruthless corporate executive, harboring a desperate ambition to claim the CEO title.

We are going to hold viewers hostage every Wednesday at 9 pm.\u201d\n\nThe highly-anticipated watch party, expertly hosted by renowned On-Air Personality Ifunanya Igwe, boasted an impressive guest list that included esteemed personalities such as Fred Amata, Professor Shola Fosudo, Patrick Doyle, and Zeke Zulu\n\n"

        "title": "XRP Price Forecast: Expert Predicts Significant Surge in Coming Months - The Currency Analytics",
        "content": "Ripple/XRP is a digital payment protocol and cryptocurrency that aims to facilitate fast, low-cost international money transfers. Developed by Ripple Labs, the platform was designed to provide a seamless and efficient method for transferring value across borders. Unlike traditional banking systems that rely on intermediaries and can be slow and costly, Ripple uses blockchain technology to enable direct transfers between parties.\n\nAt the core of Ripple\u2019s technology is its consensus algorithm known as the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA). This algorithm ensures agreement among network participants on the validity and order of transactions. By achieving consensus, Ripple eliminates the need for mining and reduces the energy consumption associated with traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has always been a hotbed of speculation and debate, and XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple, is no exception. In recent months, there has been growing interest and excitement surrounding the future price of XRP. Notably, Thomas Kralow, a crypto hedge fund manager at Kralow Capital, has made a bold prediction, forecasting a significant price surge for XRP in the coming months. In this article, we will explore Kralow\u2019s insights, examine the increasing interest in XRP, and discuss the potential implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nThomas Kralow\u2019s prediction of a price surge in XRP aligns with the increasing interest in the cryptocurrency among enthusiasts. Recent data from Google Trends reveals a doubling of global searches for XRP, indicating a heightened curiosity among digital traders. This surge in interest can be attributed to various factors, including the recent developments surrounding Ripple\u2019s legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the overall growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBuilding upon these observations, Kralow suggests that XRP\u2019s price could experience a remarkable escalation in the coming months. He puts forth estimations ranging from $10 to $30, representing a monumental leap from its current trading value of $0.483. While such price predictions are met with both excitement and skepticism, they highlight the potential for significant gains in the XRP market.\n\nWhile XRP has seen a marginal increase of 0.9% in the past day, there have been instances where its value dipped below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $0.47, albeit without closing below this mark. This volatility underscores the need for a bullish resurgence to drive XRP\u2019s price to new heights.\n\nA sustained position below the 50-day SMA might lead to further decline, potentially pushing XRP\u2019s value down to $0.41. On the other hand, a bullish resurgence would require XRP to rise swiftly above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and break the overhead resistance at $0.55. These key levels serve as important indicators for the short-term price movement of XRP.\n\nOne of the key factors impacting XRP\u2019s future is the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. The outcome of this lawsuit holds significant implications for Ripple\u2019s operations and the status of XRP as a cryptocurrency. The broader cryptocurrency community eagerly anticipates a favorable resolution, as it would allow Ripple to continue its operations unhindered and potentially lead to XRP regaining listings on various cryptocurrency exchanges. This positive outcome, combined with a bullish market trend, could propel XRP\u2019s price to reach $2 by the end of the year.\n\nWith Thomas Kralow\u2019s prediction of a significant price surge for XRP in the next quarter and the growing interest in the cryptocurrency, the market\u2019s attention remains focused on XRP\u2019s future trajectory. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. Investors should conduct thorough research, consider multiple factors, and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies. As the market continues to evolve and regulatory uncertainties are resolved, the future of XRP and its potential for growth will become clearer."
