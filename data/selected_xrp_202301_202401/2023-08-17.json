        "content": "A U.S. district judge has granted the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permission to file a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal in its case against cryptocurrency platform Ripple Labs.\n\nThis decision by Judge Analisa Torres allows the SEC to bring the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Cointelegraph reported Thursday (Aug. 17). Ripple Labs will also have the opportunity to oppose the motion.\n\nAn interlocutory appeal is when a ruling by a trial court is appealed while other aspects of the case are still ongoing, according to the report. The SEC\u2019s request for an appeal has raised concerns about its potential impact on multiple pending court cases. In a letter to Judge Torres, the SEC acknowledged that her decision could have broader implications.\n\nRipple Labs, on the other hand, has expressed opposition to the potential appeal, the report said.\n\nThe company\u2019s lawyers presented three main arguments against the SEC\u2019s request. They argued that an appeal requires a pure question of law, and the SEC\u2019s request does not raise any new legal issues that need to be reviewed. They also stated that the SEC\u2019s claim of an incorrect court ruling is not sufficient, and an immediate appeal would not advance the termination litigation proceedings.\n\nTorres had previously ruled on July 13 that Ripple\u2019s native XRP token is not a security when distributed in public sales but is considered a security in institutional sales, per the report. This ruling has been a significant development in the ongoing case against Ripple, which began in December 2020 when the SEC sued the company and its two chief executives, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, over allegations of offering an unregistered security.\n\nGarlinghouse has expressed his belief that the SEC would face a lengthy appeals process, according to the report. He stated that the law currently recognizes XRP as not being a security, and until the SEC has the opportunity to file an appeal, which could take years, he remains optimistic. Garlinghouse believes that an appeal against the retail sales ruling would only further solidify Judge Torres\u2019 decision.\n\nThe judge\u2019s July 13 ruling will have far-ranging repercussions across the digital asset ecosystem, which has long argued that its tokens do not represent securities contracts."

        "title": "Central bank digital currencies: CBDC benefits and risks - Mastercard",
        "content": "Central banks have been exploring ways to issue their own digital currencies for years. Yet their efforts haven\u2019t captured the public\u2019s attention \u2014 for better or, more recently, for worse \u2014 like cryptocurrencies have. But central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs \u2014 essentially a digital version of fiat currency backed by a government and therefore far less speculative than crypto \u2014 are gaining momentum, with the potential to have an even bigger impact on our everyday lives. Central banks around the world are experimenting with issuing these digital currencies to complement traditional payments, both the physical version in your wallet and the online version in your banking app. In fact, 93% of central banks are engaged in some form of work on CBDCs, and four retail CBDCs are already in full live circulation, according to the Bank for International Settlements. But there are many questions that central banks need to consider, says Jesse McWaters, who leads global regulatory advocacy at Mastercard. This includes the role of the private sector in CBDC issuance, security, privacy and interoperability \u2014 such as how a CBDC works with other commonly used payment mechanisms, what specific challenges CBDCs would solve and whether they\u2019re even the right tool for the job.\n\nTo bring a greater understanding of the benefits and limitations of CBDCs and how to implement them in a way that is safe, seamless and useful, Mastercard is convening a group of leading blockchain technology and payment service providers to join its new CBDC Partner Program. It\u2019s designed to foster collaboration with key players in the space so they can drive innovation and efficiencies, says Raj Dhamodharan, head of digital assets and blockchain at Mastercard. The inaugural set of partners includes CBDC platform Ripple, blockchain and Web3 software company Consensys, multi-CBDC and tokenized assets solution provider Fluency, digital identity technology provider Idemia, digital identity consultant Consult Hyperion, security technology group Giesecke+Devrient and digital asset operations platform Fireblocks. Their efforts include Fluency\u2019s work to build interoperability among different CBDCs, Consult Hyperion\u2019s work with central banks and payment processors to define their CBDC requirements and Ripple\u2019s launch of an inaugural government-issued national stablecoin in collaboration with the Republic of Palau, in addition to work on four CBDC pilots. \u201cWe believe in payment choice and that interoperability across the different ways of making payments is an essential component of a flourishing economy,\u201d Dhamodharan says. \u201cAs we look ahead toward a digitally driven future, it will be essential that the value held as a CBDC is as easy to use as other forms of money.\u201d CBDC program partner Giesecke+Devrient, based in Germany, has a legacy in public currency that dates back 170 years, when it first started printing banknotes. Today the company specializes in safeguarding both physical and digital assets. It works with central banks to roll out digital currencies, offering its CBDC solution called G+D Filia, which can enable secure offline payments. That feature is important both for ensuring as many people as possible can use CBDCs and ensuring you can access your money even amid connectivity problems or power failures. Filia can be used for online and offline payments using a variety of wallet types and IoT devices. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that cash is still there, and that won\u2019t change, but there is emerging demand for a public digital currency,\u201d says Sebastian Baierle, manager of strategic partnerships for CBDC at G+D. \u201cAnd the intentions vary from country to country.\u201d Baierle says the Bank of Ghana \u2014 which is partnering with G+D on its CBDC pilot \u2014 wants to use CBDCs to bring more of its citizens into the formal financial economy. By contrast, the Swedish central bank might be more concerned that the rapid shift away from cash in that country is reducing consumers\u2019 access to a form of money directly backed by the central bank, something it is committed to preserving, McWaters says.\n\n\"As we look ahead towards a digitally driven future, it will be essential that the value held as a CBDC is as easy to use as other forms of money.\u201d Raj Dhamodharan\n\nAs the technology continues to mature, there\u2019s still plenty for this partnership to study and consider. For one thing, CBDCs have yet to gain wide acceptance. While BIS expects as many as 24 central bank digital currencies to be circulating by decade\u2019s end, more than two-thirds of central banks say they\u2019re unlikely, in the near term, to issue a digital currency people can use for everyday purchases. This stems partly from the complex issues involved, says Varun Paul, who was most recently head of the Bank of England\u2019s fintech hub and now oversees CBDC and market infrastructure for Fireblocks. For example, central banks must determine how to strike the right balance between privacy and transparency, to prevent illicit activities while preserving an individual\u2019s right to privacy. \u201cPrivacy is extremely important to users. It\u2019s really the No. 1 topic,\u201d says Jerome Ajdenbaum, who leads the digital currencies business for Idemia, citing a recent European Central Bank survey on the digital euro. It\u2019s vital to demonstrate to the user that their privacy is protected, \u201cnot just that we promise\u201d to do so, he adds. Idemia develops cryptographic techniques for offline payments to ensure privacy for individuals, while still maintaining enough oversight to prevent fraud. The company has partnered with the Bank of England on exactly this issue, working to understand the right level of privacy for its CBDC project. Another conundrum is getting people to use the new digital currency. In the few countries that have formally adopted CBDCs, some people have been reluctant to adopt a form of money they\u2019re not familiar with, Fireblocks\u2019 Paul notes. Hesitancy may have increased in the wake of last year\u2019s \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d with scandals threatening the trust that the digital ecosystem needs to evolve and thrive. Paul says that recent high-profile collapses actually strengthen the case for CBDCs, which (like regular currency and government bonds) are fully backed by a central bank and government. For CBDCs to succeed in the years ahead will also require central banks to build trust through improved communication. \u201cI\u2019d argue,\u201d Paul says, \u201cthat there\u2019s a huge amount to be done to explain to the public what this thing is, why it should be used and when it should be used.\u201d CBDCs shouldn\u2019t be adopted in a vacuum, and the work of the Mastercard CBDC Partner Program will help central banks understand how to develop a CBDC that adds something new and valuable to the economy, McWaters says. \u201cBy assembling the strengths, deep expertise and different capabilities of these partners, we can drive innovation in the central banking community and along the CBDC value chain as the space continues to evolve,\u201d Dhamodharan says. Implemented poorly, a CBDC could create disruptions in the established payment system and crowd out private sector investment. Citing U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell on the potential for a digital dollar, McWaters adds, \u201cIt\u2019s more important to get it right than to be first.\u201d\n\nTo bring greater understanding of the benefits and limitations of CBDCs and how to implement them in a way that is safe, seamless and useful, Mastercard is convening a group of leading blockchain technology and payment service providers to join its new CBDC Partner Program.
