        "title": "Britain?s first shared solar park to be built in Devon - Renewable Energy Magazine",
        "content": "Tuesday, 18 April 2023\n\nRES is entering an agreement to sell its Derril Water Solar Park to a Ripple managed co-operative. Shared solar is a new, affordable and simple way for households to act on climate change and shrink their carbon footprint. Households across Devon and Britain will be able to buy and own part of the pioneering project which is located approximately 1.2 kilometres away from the village of Pyworthy.\n\nRipple is ring-fencing 10 percent of the ownership of Derril Water Solar Park exclusively for those in the surrounding area and is urging interested local households and businesses to come forward. From Tuesday 18th April, individuals in the local area will be given two weeks exclusive access to buy shares from the ring fenced portion of the project. Owners of the solar park will see savings applied to their electricity bill, based on how much electricity their share of the solar park generates. By co-owning Derril Water Solar Park, members will be able to power their homes with local green energy, and slash their energy bills whilst reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nThe remaining 90 percent of the people-powered solar park will be open to people across Britain. Ripple has already proven its model with two consumer-owned wind farms in Wales and Scotland (the UK\u2019s first and the UK\u2019s largest of its kind). Derril Water Solar Park will be Ripple\u2019s third and most ambitious project to date and is an important milestone in its mission to make green energy ownership accessible to everyone.\n\nRES will continue its involvement in the project, undertaking the construction and providing operational services once the solar park starts generating clean energy.\n\n\u201cBy offering consumer ownership, Derril Water Solar Park will become a completely different kind of solar park, one owned by the people it supplies low cost green power to\u201d said Sarah Merrick, founder and CEO of Ripple Energy. \u201cWe want Derril Water to become a blueprint for consumer-owned solar parks around the world. We want to create a wave of green energy ownership that enables people to make a real climate impact, as well as stabilising their energy bills. People from all corners of Britain will be able to co-own Derril Water Solar Park, and we hope as many as possible will become part of this pioneering project.\u201d\n\nIncreasing biodiversity and habitat creation around its renewable energy projects is central to Ripple\u2019s approach. RES specifically designed Derril Water to ensure the solar park delivers a net biodiversity gain and ecological improvements across the site.\n\nThe site is currently predominantly arable habitats (primarily cattle-grazed improved grassland and grass leys), which are considered to be of low ecological value. Through plans created by RES, these areas will be transformed with the creation of new habitats, and planting species-rich grassland, native trees and hedgerows around the site. In addition, bird and bat boxes, hedgehog houses, dormouse boxes, bee banks and invertebrate hotels will be built to provide more habitat creation of key insects and pollinators which will increase the flora and fauna as a result of the development. It is anticipated that the number of habitat units will be increased by 90 percent and there will be an increase of 30 percent of existing hedgerows.\n\nRipple is ring-fencing 10 percent of Derril Water Solar Park for local households and businesses to buy for two weeks, so they can own and be supplied by their local solar park. In addition, the co-op will create a Community Benefit Fund which will provide \u00a31,000/MW annually - expected to be up to \u00a342,000 per year towards good causes in the local community. Working closely with the local community, Ripple and the co-op will determine how best the fund is used. RES has committed \u00a315,000 towards the warm hub project at the local village hall and will match funds raised locally in support of the project.\n\nLocal contractors and employees will be used where possible during the construction of the solar park. RES has a strong track-record of delivering significant local investment and opportunities through construction. The major opportunities arise during the construction phase when local firms are invited to bid for different aspects of construction. Contractors will be encouraged to source construction materials locally (i.e. within the county) and to use local transport and plant hire companies where possible, in addition to local services and amenities.\n\nTorridge District Council retains 100 percent of all the business rates due from renewable energy businesses (solar parks and wind farms) to fund vital local services for all local residents. It is estimated the Derril Water Solar Park will deliver approximately \u00a3162,000 in business rates annually.\n\nFor additional information:\n\nRipple Energy\n\nRES"

        "title": "How a Ripple CBDC project in Montenegro could influence payments globally - American Banker",
        "content": "Montenegro's central bank is working on a digital currency that could provide clues for international interoperability. Bloomberg News\n\nRipple recently launched a central bank digital currency project in Montenegro, a country of only 630,000 people that could provide clues to how to make different countries' digital currencies work in harmony.\n\n\"There is no one-size-fits-all approach to CBDC,\" said Joe Vollono, director of business development for CBDC at Ripple. \"Every country is pursuing a CBDC for specific reasons. We recognize how important it is to develop a custom solution for our partners.\"\n\nTo balance that need for a custom CBDC that can still work with other countries, Ripple is using open-source development, blockchain and standardized messaging. These technologies and methods are meant to streamline communication. They may also address the question of how payments involving two different CBDCs will work with one another and with traditional currencies.\n\n\"Ripple now has multiple CBDC projects ongoing around the world and is in dialogue with dozens of central banks globally,\" Vollono said.\n\nMontenegro's central bank will work with Ripple, banks, academia and others to create a digital currency and test the underlying blockchain's functionality, compliance with regulations and potential use cases. It will also analyze the risks and opportunities inherent in a CBDC, and how it will work with the European Union's CBDC project and similar initiatives in different countries.\n\n\"We have been developing standards for cross-border payments for over ten years, and have seen firsthand how complex and challenging this is,\" Vollono said, adding that Ripple was a contributor to the development of the ISO 20022 messaging standard, which adds more data and transaction information to payments for e-commerce, real-time processing and other digital purchases.\n\n\"To successfully achieve this interoperability, it cannot be done in silos but rather as a payments ecosystem,\" Vollono said.\n\n\n\nOpen for business\n\nThere are dozens of CBDC projects underway globally, with much of the work geared toward interoperability among CBDCs, since a digital currency is much more useful if it can operate internationally. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is testing international CBDC payments with the Monetary Authority of Singapore , which is also part of several other cross-border CBDC projects.\n\nThere are several options at work to encourage interoperability among CBDCs, with one of the most promising being open-source development, Vollono said. Banks are starting to warm up to open source, which allows code to be made freely available and can add efficiency to technology development.\n\nBuilding a digital currency with open-source technology is one of the best ways to address the challenges and create opportunities around interoperability, as it builds a path for the global community to collaborate and build standards by which CBDCs can function, Vollono contends.\n\nOpen-source development can be useful for achieving interoperability between different CBDCs, according to Nick Donarski, the founder and chief technology officer of ORE-System, a distributed ledger company.\n\n\"Open-source development allows for collaboration between different developers and communities, enabling the creation of common tools and frameworks used by different CBDC projects,\" Donarski said.\n\n\n\nGlobal influence\n\nSimilar to most CBDC projects, the Montenegro initiative involves experiments and pilots of a CBDC that may never exist, since the government must make a final decision on whether to move forward.\n\nThe U.S. and most European countries are working on CBDCs while legislatures and central banks debate use cases and the potential impact CBDCs may have on existing financial systems and digital assets such as stablecoins. Whether most countries have a CBDC will depend on their legislators \u2014 whose votes could be years away.\n\nBut the work on interoperability for CBDCs could inform work on stablecoins or real-time processing, which are also challenged to find ways to enable transactions between different jurisdictions.\n\nIn the event that CBDCs gain traction, open-source collaboration and development among central banks will be key to guaranteeing compatibility and efficient communication between digital currencies, said Mark Fidelman, founder of SmartBlocks, a distributed finance technology company.\n\nFidelman, a private DeFi developer who is generally opposed to CBDCs, says interoperable payment systems could provide the necessary infrastructure for secure, scalable and cost-effective cross-border transactions.\n\n\"APIs can bridge the gap between different CBDCs, ensuring compatibility and seamless interaction,\" Fidelman said. \"This approach may facilitate a smoother transition, should CBDCs become inevitable.\"\n\nUltimately, interoperability between CBDCs will be through blockchain technology, standardized technical specifications and protocols, open-source development and digital identity and authentication technologies, Donarski said.\n\n\"These approaches can help to create a more connected and interoperable financial ecosystem, enabling individuals and businesses to transact across borders with greater ease and at a lower cost,\" he said.\n\nBuilding bridges between different blockchains is crucial for the success of the digital-asset ecosystem, said Aaron Rafferty, CEO of StandardDAO, a fintech company that specializes in underserved markets.\n\nStandardDAO partners with blockchain-supported projects in local markets, as well as projects that support international transactions. \"To achieve interoperability among CBDCs, it is important to maintain a consistent record of transactions and value across various blockchains,\" Rafferty said.\n\nA practical example of digital-asset interoperability in action is Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) , which allows bitcoin to be used on the Ethereum network, Rafferty said. The supply of wBTC is monitored through mechanisms leveraging a cross-ledger crypto communication tool called an oracle , ensuring that the asset's value is accurately represented even when it is utilized outside of its native blockchain, Rafferty said.\n\n\"This same concept can be applied to CBDC development, ensuring that no matter which blockchain a country chooses for its digital currency, the value and record of supply will be preserved across networks,\" Rafferty said.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding whether CBDCs will even exist in most countries, there is momentum in development.\n\n\"There will be progress this year building interoperability between the global patchwork of domestic faster or real-time interbank payment systems,\" said Eric Grover, a principal at Intrepid Ventures, adding that an important focus for most CBDC projects in the near term will be on launching and demonstrating use cases.\n\n\"Facilitating cross-border remittances would be an interesting use case,\" Grover said. \"Improving cross-border B2B payments is being addressed by private systems, but CBDCs could support them as well. And moving funds between central banks would be a straightforward use case.\"\n\nThere has been incremental movement toward identifying interoperability models and scalability of technology with support from leading distributed ledger firms like Circle, Stellar, Swift and card brands like Visa and Mastercard, according to Nilesh Vaidya, global industry head for retail banking and wealth management at Capgemini.\n\n\"As the adoption of wholesale CBDCs continues to grow, it's becoming increasingly clear that cross-border functionality is essential for their success,\" Vaidya said. \"However, until there is a global standard for creating CBDCs, interoperability between different chains and existing payment rails is crucial.\"\n\n"

        "title": "Beryl Kelly's devotion to the Gorey community will have ripple effects for years to come - Irish Independent",
        "content": "Beryl Kelly was the driving force behind countless community organisations and initiatives in Gorey and, while she may no longer be with us, the impact of her endless generosity and kindness will have ripple effects across the community long into the future.\n\nBeryl died peacefully at St Vincent\u2019s Hospital on Friday, April 7. In the days since her death, many who knew her have remembered the kindness that the nurse and dedicated volunteer extended to people around the community.\n\nHer funeral mass in St Michael\u2019s Church on Thursday, April 13 saw people come in their droves to remember this woman who gave a lifetime of care to the community. Many of her endless number of contributions were recalled in a touching eulogy by her son Aidan.\n\nBeryl Cookson was born in 1950 to George and Renee Cookson in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. She and her twin sister Renee grew up on Quarrendon Estate with their cousins Sheila and Jean along with Aunt Glad and Uncle Reg. They also had close friends in Uncle Don and Aunt Linda with their daughter Jan and their son Jim who spent every weekend with Beryl and Renee. This would be the seed of the idea of community for Beryl.\n\nAfter school, Beryl had several jobs but she soon found her calling in nursing and began her journey as a nurse in the Stoke Mandeville Hospital. It was here that she met a lovely Irish girl called Margot who was following in her own mother\u2019s footsteps by training in Stoke Mandeville. The pair became good friends and during a visit to Margot\u2019s homeplace of Kilkenny, Beryl met Margot\u2019s older brother Michael. Ever the romantic, his first words to her were \u201cpass the salt please\u201d.\n\nBeing a poetic and romantic man, his proposal was something to behold. \u201cHow would you like to move to Ireland? You know what I\u2019m asking don\u2019t ya?\u201d he said. Beryl accepted his matter-of-fact proposal and the pair became husband and wife after getting married in St Mary\u2019s Church Aylesbury on November 17, 1973.\n\nShortly after their wedding, the pair moved to Cloneapower in County Waterford where, despite being low on money, they built a comfortable home together. They moved to Ballymacarbary, Ballythomas and later to Gorey, where the family had grown to six with Ivan, Natasha, Aidan and Gareth.\n\nBeryl may not have been from Gorey originally but she quickly became the heart of the community.\n\nHer door was always open and children from all across the neighbourhood knew the Park Avenue house as a place where they could come to play, get support and have all of their questions answered. As a nurse, Beryl\u2019s advice was often sought during a medical emergency, and she was even brought injured animals from time to time.\n\nBeryl was determined and kind to her core, and her drive to help other people was endless. Her concern for others led her to spearhead a huge number of organisations within the community. She joined the local scout group and became a leader where she set up Gorey Beavers with Angela Travers among others. Angela, who was a swim instructor, got Beryl involved with setting up the local swim club and a similar group for people with additional needs.\n\nBeryl also joined Michael in volunteering with the local Red Cross group and quickly found that her nursing background was very beneficial. The pair later went on to establish their own company, First Aim Teaching, with which they first aid all over the country.\n\nHer passion for teaching first aid was particularly strong when it came to educating young people and, inspired by this, Beryl formed a Red Cross Youth group and authored a series of books on first aid for children. Those who wish for copies of these books are encouraged to contact Beryl\u2019s family.\n\nBeryl and Michael\u2019s community work did not stop there. Inspired by her own mother\u2019s love for lifeboats, Beryl and Michael played a pivotal role with both Courtown RNLI and Cahore Inshore Rescue Service. The pair taught first aid to the crews of both, ensuring they were trained and prepared for any situation they may be faced with.\n\nRecognising that marine first aid required different skills to other medical situations, Beryl and Michael created an elementary course devoted to first aid at sea.\n\nBeryl\u2019s love for the Cahore lifeboat didn\u2019t stop there and just last year completed an amazing 530 k.m. length of Ireland cycle to raise funds for this deserving cause.\n\nWhen Beryl took anything on, she never did the bare minimum. She always endeavoured to get instructor-level knowledge on the topics that she was working on so that she could pass what she had learned on to others.\n\nHer capacity and desire to give back never dried up. Because of this, it is certain that Beryl\u2019s capacity for care and extensive knowledge will not end with her.\n\nWithin the many groups that she founded and volunteered for, she passed her skills on to younger generations and many of those inspired by her are continuing her legacy in roles in the medical profession. Many people have said that being taught by Beryl was so easy because she made it fun to learn, had great wit and had the ability to get the message across and make it easy to understand.\n\nIn 1990, Beryl became a founding member of Gorey Arch Club to address the need for a social outlet for people with special needs. She remained involved in the running of the club throughout her life and was the backbone of the club for many years. As a result of her experience with the Arch and swim club, Beryl became a volunteer for the Special Olympics World Games in Dublin in 2003.\n\nAll of this work influenced the establishment of the SOCGA (Special Olympic Club Gorey Area), which remains strong in the community today. She held many roles in the club and later a role with the SO Leinster Regional committee as a Medical Coordinator. Her enthusiasm for this work never faded and she continued working and learning right up until her final days.\n\nIn 2020, Volunteer Ireland recognised Beryl for her outstanding commitment and dedication to Special Olympics in the Gorey area (SOCGA) over many years. One of just three winners nationally in the Sports and Recreation category, Beryl was nominated for this award by the Special Olympics Leinster Regional Team. However, two of the biggest highlights for Beryl were being a part of the first Irish Team to win the European First Aid Championships in Trondheim, Norway in 1995 and fulfilling her ambition to become an EMT, even going out on calls with the local Ambulance crews.\n\nWhile Beryl offered a huge amount of support to others through the many organisations she founded, it didn\u2019t end with her work.\n\nHer house on Park Avenue was also a place where everyone was welcome and it became fondly known as HQ. It was a place where anyone could come and find shelter and for a lot of people a place to stay till they got back on their feet. Everyone was made to feel welcome, and her generosity knew no bounds. Beryl\u2019s friends, family and neighbours have many fond memories of enjoying conversation, card games and tea at HQ, and they\u2019re sure to form stories that will be shared for many years to come.\n\nBeryl\u2019s house was also the centre of many a donation drive, including one book drive inspired by a simple conversation.\n\nFollowing the break up of the Soviet Union, Beryl met a Red Cross delegate from Lithuania who informed her that they did not have many English language books in the country.\n\nThe endlessly-determined Beryl chose not only to listen, but to take action, and organised a book drive in Gorey. Realising that Lithuania and Ireland were due to play a soccer match in the weeks that followed, Beryl contacted the FAI and arranged for the book collection to travel to Lithuania alongside Jack Charlton and the Irish team.\n\nBeryl was a loving, kind, caring and generous woman who gave so much to her family, friends and the wider Gorey community. In the days since her death, tributes have been paid to her from people around the country.\n\nCahore Inshore Rescue Service have reflected on her \u201ckindness, wisdom, advice, support and sense of fun\u201d during her many years providing training with them. The Gorey branch of the Irish Red Cross have remembered Beryl\u2019s \u201cfriendly voice\u201d and the fact she had \u201calways a kind word for everyone, a shoulder to cry on. Always just a phone call away when needed\u201d. Special Olympics Ireland have vowed to carry on Beryl\u2019s \u201ccommitment, generosity and sense of humour\u201d in the years to come.\n\nBeryl was the beloved wife of Michael and loving mother of Ivan, Natasha, Aidan and Gareth and sister of Renee, Sash and the late Jean. She will be deeply missed by her loving husband, daughter, sons, sisters, grandchild Grace, son-in-law Colin, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, nieces, nephews, relatives, friends, neighbours and extended family members Brian, Brendan, Barry, Trevor, Joann, Tom, Marta and Ann Bolger.\n\nMay she rest in peace."
