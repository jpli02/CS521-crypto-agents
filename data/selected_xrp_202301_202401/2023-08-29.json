        "title": "XRP price could drop to $0.41, amidst developments in SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ripple counsel prepares for the SEC\u2019s appeal against the ruling, with the Howey Test and former SEC official William Hinman\u2019s speech in focus.\n\nXRP has a historic trend of closing September at a loss.\n\nXRP price climbs above the $0.50 psychological barrier, unable to start a decisive uptrend.\n\nXRP price has failed to break into an upward trend after struggling to get past the $0.52 hurdle. As the altcoin attempts its recovery, there are two catalysts that can drive changes in its price: The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) vs. Ripple lawsuit and XRP\u2019s historic trend of negative monthly returns in September.\n\nRipple attorneys are preparing to tackle the SEC\u2019s interlocutory appeal against Judge Torres\u2019 ruling. Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton shifted focus to former SEC official William Hinman\u2019s speech and the Howey Test\u2019s application to XRP.\n\nBased on data from crypto price tracker Cryptorank.io, XRP has typically yielded losses for holders in September. This has been the case three out of five times since 2018. If history repeats itself, XRP price is at risk of decline this month.\n\nAlso read: XRP price makes comeback above $0.50 as pro-XRP lawyer urges former SEC officials\u2019 testimony\n\nRipple counsel prepare for SEC appeal with Hinman speech and Howey Test in focus\n\nThe SEC is set to file its interlocutory appeal against the Ripple ruling issued by Judge Analisa Torres. The ruling was interpreted as a partial victory for Ripple in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit, however, the regulator is set to appeal before the case heads into trial.\n\nPro-XRP attorney John Deaton shared key information that could support Ripple counsel\u2019s preparedness against the SEC\u2019s appeal. Deaton commented on a \u201cmemo\u201d written by the SEC\u2019s enforcement lawyers that was undisclosed to the public. Deaton stated that Judge Netburn found it important to note that authors of the memo did not recommend any action be taken against XRP token.\n\nTo be clear, I didn\u2019t say the memo concluded XRP is not a security. The memo was found to be privileged and not disclosed so I haven\u2019t read exactly what it says. But Judge Netburn found it important to note that the authors of the memo, who were Enforcement lawyers at the SEC,\u2026 \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 27, 2023\n\nTherefore, in June of 2018, the memo did not warrant any action to be taken, declaring XRP as a security or alleging Ripple\u2019s sale of unregistered securities. Deaton said the memo was most likely inconclusive.\n\nXRP price historically closes September at losses\n\nThe second catalyst influencing XRP price is the likelihood of the token closing September at a loss. Between 2018 and 2022, XRP closed September at a loss three out of five times. In 2022, XRP price rallied 46.2%, against the historic trend.\n\nWith the altcoin\u2019s price struggling to begin its upward trend, it is likely that XRP closes September by yielding losses for token holders.\n\nXRP Monthly Returns over the years as seen on cryptorank.io\n\nXRP price drifts at $0.52, likely headed for decline\n\nLockridge Okoth, a technical analyst at FXStreet, evaluated the XRP price trend and predicted a decline in the altcoin, unless it makes a decisive break past $0.57. The analyst argues that XRP price is at a risk of a drop to the range low at $0.41, unless it reverses trend.\n\nIf XRP successfully breaks past the $0.57 level, the altcoin could tag the monthly high of $0.68.\n\nXRP/USDT one-day price chart on Binance\n\nIf selling pressure on the altcoin increases, XRP is likely to continue its downward trend and head to support below $0.41."

        "title": "The wellness ripple effect: promote mental health training in student organizations - The Daily Texan",
        "content": "At a large university, it can be daunting to find your place among the thousands. Peer organizations provide a smaller circle for students to connect with each other, develop personally and professionally and make the most of their time on campus. In effect, student organization leaders have an important responsibility to mold the student experience for the better.\n\nAs we kick off the new year, student leaders have the opportunity to help their peers build a strong foundation for success. In particular, studies show that mental health is a precursor for students to thrive academically. While in college, students are more likely to neglect components of their overall well-being, such as sleep, nutrition and mindfulness, which correlates to worsened anxiety, depression and academic struggles.\n\nLonghorn Wellness Center offers workshops, such as Mental Health First Aid, to equip groups with essential skills for intervention, mental health support and building a safer, healthier community at UT, but it\u2019s up to an organization\u2019s leadership to request these resources.\n\nWhile building a strong relationship with crucial campus resources, student leaders can actually promote the well-being of the entire UT community by educating and training their organization members. Psychologists suggest that wellness practices cause a \u201cripple effect\u201d \u2014 our words, actions and feelings affect those around us, who in turn impact people around them, and so on. This effect extends not only among peers but also across various facets of an individual\u2019s life, including academic performance and contributions to student organizations.\n\n\u201cMany of us, particularly college students, go through periods in life where we deal with more stress or mental health challenges,\u201d said Katy Redd, CMHC\u2019s Director of Prevention and Development. \u201cSo what (LWC and CMHC) can do is come in and provide an opportunity to discuss facts, strategies and behavior. We\u2019re really interested in asking \u2018How is this (skill) going to work for you in your life?\u2019\u201d\n\nGroup workshops center on topics from self-care to helping a friend in distress. By partnering with LWC to practice these skills, student leaders promote the reach of mental health resources on campus, fostering a network of support.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a really beautiful connection piece that happens when the peers deliver workshops,\u201d said Angelique Karditzas, Health Promotion Coordinator for LWC.\n\nBy giving students the skills to handle crises, these workshops also have the potential to prevent them in the first place. Well-being strategies help students avoid the trappings of overachievement and hyper-performance, reminding them that they are humans first and students second.\n\n\u201cIf you, as a student leader, find that your group could benefit from one of these workshops, I think it\u2019s a really good leadership point to be proactive about giving your group this kind of information,\u201d Karditzas said.\n\nGiven that the brain is not fully mature until age 20 or later, most students don\u2019t have the emotional regulation and behavioral control to cope with the stress of college. By empowering students to recognize and address distress, they can correct problems surrounding well-being before they become unmanageable.\n\nWithin student orgs, improved student wellness shapes team members who are more confident, motivated and productive. Wellness should be at the core of leadership priorities, and LWC workshops offer an avenue for student leaders to fulfill that crucial need while promoting a supportive campus.\n\nJackson is a Plan II and journalism sophomore from Boerne, Texas."

        "title": "The Ripple Effect of Yellow's Demise on the Supply Chain Industry - SupplyChainBrain",
        "content": "The financial collapse of Yellow, the third-largest less-than-truckload (LTL) carrier in the U.S., will incur some challenges in the transportation world that people might not have considered.\n\nBefore Yellow went out of business, UPS was experiencing ripples in its labor force, which was threatening to strike. Recent labor disputes have spurred activity within the shipping community. Shippers are reaching out to other carriers to avoid potential disruptions resulting from providers abruptly ceasing service.\n\nMany in the industry see the collapse of Yellow as an excellent opportunity for smaller carriers to acquire new business. However, a lot of these smaller providers already operate at 90% capacity. When you add 100% of Yellow's freight to the marketplace, existing carriers can\u2019t handle the additional volume without buying new trucks and hiring new drivers. Larger carriers may have more spare capacity to absorb this freight, however.\n\nThe situation has been a long time coming. When trucking was deregulated in 1984, the three largest LTL carriers and other unionized carriers faced greater competition from non-union providers. Consolidated Freightways went out of business in 2002, and Teamsters began accepting concessions to even out the cost advantages of non-union LTL carriers. Then, in 2004, Yellow acquired unionized rival Roadway, for which it paid $1 billion. The integration of overlapping networks proved difficult, and added to the company's problems.\n\nIn Yellow's most recent financial report, the company carried over $1.5 billion in long-term debt, half of which came from a pandemic-era bailout loan. Yellow used the money to purchase new tractors and catch up on delinquent benefits and payments to union members. Still, Yellow today has one of the oldest fleets in the industry.\n\nTeamsters concessions helped out Yellow financially, but the company said it would be out of money again if the union didn't approve specific operational changes. The Teamsters refused, and on July 30, Yellow ceased operations.\n\nWhat Can Carriers Do Now?\n\nBruce Chan, research director for transportation with Stifel, says the industry is just beginning to see a migration of Yellow customers to other carriers. \"Shippers that utilize LTL carriers could see increases as high as 20% in shipping rates with the exit of Yellow, one of the sector's lowest-cost carriers,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe company owned about 10% of the LTL market, so capacity will tighten.\"\n\nChan anticipates that Yellow's 10% market share will be redistributed to others in the industry. He believes that some existing LTL carriers with pricing closer to what Yellow offered its customers will gain business.\n\nWith the demise of Yellow, prices could rise \u201cin the high single-digit range,\" Chan says. \"I think it's very safe to assume that the industry pricing moves up. And certainly, the freight that was with Yellow that needs to find a new home will be repriced at higher levels.\"\n\nWhat Can Shippers Do?\n\nShippers who relied on the low-cost LTL carrier are in for sticker shock. When they learned that Yellow was going under, many began reaching out to a mix of large and smaller carriers to secure pricing and capacity. A WSJ article reports that truckers in Yellow's markets \u201chave seen from 2,000 to 3,000 added shipments each day in recent weeks, a welcome infusion in a U.S. freight market that has been turning downward this year.\u201d\n\nShippers are considering additional ways to address the challenges caused by Yellow\u2019s demise. One option is changing product packaging. Another is breaking pallets into individual products and shipping via parcel or smaller regional carriers. While this will get orders into the hands of end customers, it could cause an increase in transportation spend.\n\nShippers now have an opportunity to consolidate their LTL shipments into full truckloads. Freight-optimization software can help analyze the best way to do this. Consolidation of LTL into TL shipments lowers cost by reducing the number of carriers needed. Fewer shipments also result in lower fuel consumption and carbon emissions. By maximizing available carrier capacity, companies can reduce the number of empty or underutilized trucks on the road.\n\nLTL carriers rely on terminals to move freight through their networks. Shipments come from a warehouse or distribution center to the terminal, then are shipped to the end user. Yellow had more than 300 terminals that are now closed and will eventually be up for sale. They are mostly near high population centers, making deliveries quicker and at a lower cost. Working with a third-party logistics (3PL) provider with a vast network of carriers can help shippers find the right LTL carrier with terminals in prime locations to keep costs and travel time down.\n\nYellow\u2019s collapse will have a ripple effect over the supply chain for the next year or two, and maybe beyond. But with the economy looking strong, shipments are picking up, so shippers and carriers should have a solid year in 2023 and 2024.\n\nChris Schramm is director of sales and accounts at Nexterus."

        "title": "When it comes to the Hollywood strikes, it's not just the entertainment industry that's being hurt - The Associated Press",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The company had struggled for years, tossed around by pandemic-induced production shutdowns that began in March 2020. Last year, though, business for Valentino\u2019s Costume Group had finally picked back up.\n\nHoping to capitalize on that good fortune, the shop moved in January to a North Hollywood space twice the size of its old building.\n\nThen Hollywood\u2019s screenwriters and actors went on strike. Now, says co-owner Shon LeBlanc, Valentino\u2019s can no longer afford to pay its rent.\n\n\u201cMy chest is tightening because the money is so tight,\u201d says LeBlanc, bemoaning the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\u2019 apparent lack of urgency to try to reach an agreement with the unions. \u201cWhen is the mayor going to step in and say, \u2018I\u2019m ordering you guys to figure something out because you\u2019re about to collapse the economy in Los Angeles?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt has been well over 100 days since members of the Writers Guild of America stopped working, and more than a month since the actors union joined them. LeBlanc\u2019s is just one story of many detailing the financial ripple effects.\n\nFew corners of the entertainment industry have been left unscathed\n\nFrom studio rentals and set construction to dry cleaning for costumes and transportation to sets, it\u2019s hard to find a corner of the Los Angeles economy that has entirely escaped the reverberations.\n\n\u201cA movie set in one day can generate tens of thousands of dollars,\u201d says Kevin Klowden, chief strategist with the Milken Institute, a think tank that researches social and economic issues. \u201cDepending on the level of activity, it can be hundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nThe last writers strike, more than 15 years ago, took three months to resolve and is conservatively estimated to have cost $2.1 billion in lost output. This time around, the number will be harder to measure given how much production costs, locations and timelines have changed in recent years thanks to technological improvements and increased globalization.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than 100 days since members of the Writers Guild of America stopped working \u2013 and more than a month since the actors\u2019 union joined them. The financial ripples that the strikes have caused are too wide-reaching to count, making it difficult to find a corner of the Los Angeles economy that has entirely escaped the reverberations. (Aug. 28)\n\n\u201cWe tend to think of productions as sort of a self-contained thing,\u201d Klowden says, while in reality, a production often spans companies and even countries. Projects are often \u201cshipped off\u201d to New Zealand for the addition of visual effects, he cites as an example. \u201cThe larger a production is, the more likely you are to see a whole bunch of different tax credit mentions at the end.\u201d\n\nBoth guilds are seeking to address issues brought about by the dominance of streaming services, which have changed all aspects of production, from how projects are written to when they\u2019re released.\n\nFor the writers, the guild has said the use of small staffs, known as \u201cmini rooms\u201d (a riff on the notion of the \u201cwriters\u2019 room\u201d), for shorter time periods has made a living income hard to achieve. Actors\u2019 concerns include protections on the use of artificial intelligence.\n\nAlthough talks between the WGA and the AMPTP have resumed, there are no plans between the actors and studios to return to the bargaining table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really understanding what the silent treatment is,\u201d SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher told The Associated Press last week. \u201cIt could be a tactical strategy to see if we they can wait us out until we lose our resolve and then they can make a better deal for themselves.\u201d\n\nSAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher poses for a portrait, Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2023, at the SAG-AFTRA offices in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nIn an earnings call at the beginning of August, Hudson Pacific executives tried to assuage concerns about the financial impact that the strikes are having on their businesses, while still conceding the reality behind those fears. The company owns both Quixote and Sunset Studios, two major equipment and studio rental companies in the entertainment industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hugely aware of the shrapnel around the industry in general and all of the residual businesses that are getting affected. It will start to feel fairly painful,\u201d warned its chair and CEO Victor Coleman in response to questions of how long the strikes may last. \u201cIt will be damaging. And I think everybody is very cognizant of that.\u201d\n\nThe fallout reaches beyond entertainment, into all corners of LA\n\nThe uncertain duration of the strikes looms large over every business feeling the financial effects, with fallout spreading well beyond the entertainment industry. Restaurants, coffee shops, even nail salons that neighbor major studios \u2014 they\u2019re all desperate for a quick resolution.\n\nPatys Restaurant, a Toluca Lake staple that boasts regulars including Steve Carell and Adam Sandler, has seen a major slump in business from diners and catering orders, according to owner George Metsos. He cites lost businesses from obvious patrons \u2014 actors, writers, crew members \u2014 but also speaks of other regulars who aren\u2019t coming in: electricians, set carpenters and the drivers who stop in for breakfast on their way to work at the nearby valley studios.\n\nEmmanuel Pelargos, who owns Astro Burger across the street from Paramount Studios in Hollywood, says the regular presence of writers and actors on the picket lines has not offset the decline in business from halted productions.\n\n\u201cThey come in sometimes,\u201d he says of the picketers, \u201cbut it\u2019s mostly to use the bathroom.\u201d\n\nCorrie Sommers, vice president of the Toluca Lake Chamber of Commerce, says the timing of the strikes \u2014 on the heels of financial recovery from the pandemic \u2014 hits small businesses particularly hard.\n\n\u201cThe strike ... has just set everybody backwards again. Only this time, there\u2019s not the aid that is needed,\u201d Sommers says. \u201cNo one\u2019s saying, \u2018Here\u2019s some free money to bail you out. Here\u2019s some money to float you through.\u2019 That\u2019s not there anymore. And it\u2019s affecting everybody.\u201d\n\nSommers, also a real estate agent in the area, cites multiple clients who were interested in buying homes but changed their minds.\n\nShon LeBlanc displays a costume used in the musical production \"Gavroche.\" (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) Shon LeBlanc primps a bowler hat at his warehouse. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve personally had about five buyers in the last three months say, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to wait until next year because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nWhile many on strike acknowledge the financial burdens on both peers in the industry and their neighbors outside of it, the writers are standing by their decision with renewed vigor on the picket lines after the much larger actors guild joined them.\n\nLuvh Rakhe, a member of the WGA negotiating committee who has written for hit shows like \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d and \u201cNew Girl,\u201d is acutely aware of the financial costs. But he believes people across industries and professions know it is necessary.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is, like, blase and happy about the momentary disruption to their lives,\u201d Rakhe says, \u201cbut they understand why it happened and what it is hoping to achieve.\u201d\n\nDespite the burdens being placed on people in peripheral lines of work, many of them say there is a general sense of solidarity. LeBlanc, the Valentino\u2019s co-owner, continues to underscore his support, even amid the uncertain future of his 25-year-old business. (To answer his question, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass hasn\u2019t indicated she will intervene, but did say in a statement in early August that she is \u201cready to personally engage with all the stakeholders in any way possible to help get this done.\u201d)\n\nTo keep the shop afloat, Valentino\u2019s has started a GoFundMe to pay the rent for now. LeBlanc is hopeful that if they can raise enough money for the next month or so, Halloween and school productions starting back up will get them through the rest of the year.\n\n\u201cWe do have things coming up,\u201d he has assured the landlord. \u201cWe just need to get some money in here to get us over the hump.\u201d"
