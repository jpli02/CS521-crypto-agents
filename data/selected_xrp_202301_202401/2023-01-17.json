        "content": "Airwallex customers will now be able to accept American Express card payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRipple partner Airwallex has entered into a partnership with American Express to expand merchant payment acceptance options, per a press release from Airwallex today.\n\nAlso, the company shared the development via Twitter.\n\nAs a result of the partnership, Airwallex customers in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United Kingdom will now be able to accept customer payments via American Express cards. Notably, they will be able to do so via online payment portals, Xero invoice payments, and e-commerce shopping extensions.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAirwallex discloses that the partnership results from the demand from customers who want to enjoy the benefits of accepting American Express payments. The outlined benefits include higher spending, high-end customers, and better customer payment experiences.\n\nPer the press release, the partnership will leverage novel cross-border and multi-currency payment solutions, integrating Airwallex\u2019s technology with the convenience of using American Express for payments. The Ripple partner adds that it allows customers to choose from 60 payment options, including American Express.\n\nIt is worth noting that Airwallex has been a Ripple partner and RippleNet user since 2017, per a Ripple blog post. Consequently, it leverages XRP as a bridge currency in multi-currency and cross-border transactions to enable near-instant and low-cost remittances and settlements.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the latest partnership has caught the attention of XRP influencers, who have taken to Twitter to share the development.\n\nIt is the latest in a long line of partnerships between Ripple partners and renowned legacy finance institutions. As reported in December, Moneygram launched an online remittance platform in Brazil with the help of Frente Corretora, a Ripple partner. Less than a week later, DeeMoney, another Ripple partner, entered into a partnership with Visa to utilize the Visa Direct solution to offer near-instant peer-to-peer cross-border payments."
