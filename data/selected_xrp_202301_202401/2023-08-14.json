At last count, more than a dozen Republican candidates are attempting to unseat Donald Trump as the party\u2019s standard bearer in hopes of taking on President Joe Biden next fall. And even as these candidates are raising money, giving speeches, and preparing to debate, it\u2019s all taking place under the giant shadow that\u2019s been cast as a result of Trump facing multiple criminal indictments. We could see a fourth criminal indictment coming this week from Fulton County, Georgia.

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBig investors are still betting crypto\u2014and it\u2019s not just Bitcoin in their sights.\n\nInstitutional investors have poured cash into Ripple (XRP)\u2014the fifth-largest digital asset by market cap\u2014for the 16th week running, according to a Monday report from digital assets investment firm CoinShares.\n\nAssets under management for XRP products have also risen 127% since the beginning of the year, the report noted. CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt that $11.25 million worth of investor money has been put into XRP since the start of 2023.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe reason for apparently optimism is due to recent developments in the saga between Ripple Labs and regulators. In 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hit Ripple with a $1.3 billion lawsuit, alleging that it had misled investors and sold unregistered securities in the form of XRP.\n\nBut a federal district judge last month wrote in a partial ruling that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors did not qualify as securities.\n\nThe judge did, however, say that $728 million worth of contracts for institutional sales did constitute unregistered securities sales. Even so, investors\u2014and Ripple Labs\u2014broadly interpreted the ruling as positive.\n\nThe price of the asset has since surged after already being on the rise this year. Ripple\u2019s General Counsel Stu Alderoty said he expected U.S. banks to go back to using the fintech firm\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product.\n\nCoinShares\u2019 report added that institutional investors plugged $29 million last week into digital asset investment products, \u201clikely due to the recent US inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe firm added that Bitcoin remains the primary focus, with $27 million flowing into large funds designed for accredited investors, including Grayscale, 3iQ, and 21 Shares."

        "content": "Bitcoin price shows growing momentum that could see BTC hit $30,400 before a potential pullback to the $27,000 range.\n\nEthereum price is stuck within a range and could descend 5% to the demand zone before a northward propulsion.\n\nRipple price coils up for a 20% slump to the $0.5048 level unless budding momentum is sustained.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price momentum is rising, and with it, that of Ethereum (ETH) price, fueling some optimism among traders after watching the dull price action during the weekend. On the other hand, Ripple (XRP) price is on a gains-shedding exercise that could see the remittance token lose all the ground covered in the July 13 rally.\n\nAlso Read: Ex-SEC staff thinks a Republican president would be good for spot BTC ETF applications, cites partisan issues\n\nBitcoin price shows growing momentum\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price shows growing momentum after a prolonged stagnation. The people\u2019s crypto is up 2%, which is not a mean achievement considering how close-knit the price was moving along the equilibrium level at $29,399 over the weekend.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin price is $29,657 after breaking above the equilibrium level. Volatility seems to have been restored, and now BTC is on a course north and will potentially tag $30,476 if bulls nurture their current buying appetite.\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index (RSI) pointing upwards, some growing momentum could see Bitcoin price continue north. After flipping the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from a resistance level to support, upwards is the path with the least resistance. An increase in buying pressure could see BTC complete the rally to the forecasted $30,400 range.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could shatter past this hurdle to record a new range high around the $31,804 level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, a rejection from the $30,476 level could see Bitcoin price move back below the 50-day EMA and lower to break below the $28,806 support level before tagging the 100-day EMA at $28,690. If this support level fails to hold, BTC could continue south to tag the 200-day EMA at $27,265 or, in the dire case, extend to the June 19 low at around $26,344.\n\nSuch a move would constitute a 10% drop from the current level. Notably, the position of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) histograms in negative territory points to the presence of bears in the market, which could threaten the current uptrend.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin ETF potential approval could come close to BTC halving\n\nEthereum price waits for BTC confirmation\n\nEthereum (ETH) price remains in a bind, tucked between the 50- and 100-day EMAs at $1,859 and $1,843, respectively. If BTC makes a strong move north, ETH could shatter past the 50-day EMA to forge north, potentially breaching the next roadblock at $1,891.\n\nThis assumption stands considering Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to Ethereum has proven strong of late, with the two giants painting the same price action during the weekend on the four-hour timeframe.\n\nIn a highly ambitious case, the largest altcoin by market capitalization could extend into the $2,000 zone to tag $2,005, a level last tested in mid-July.\n\nThe RSI, like in the case of BTC, is edging north to show rising momentum. If this is nurtured, Ethereum price could complete the 10% climb to $2,005.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if current bullish momentum fades and bears take charge, Ethereum price could slide below the 100-day EMA at $1,843 and tag the $1,813 support level. Increased selling pressure below this level could push ETH to the 200-day EMA at $1,789.\n\nIn the dire case, Ethereum price could approach or dip into the demand zone marked in pink. This would be the likely turnaround point, considering it represents an order block where bulls are likely to buy aggressively.\n\nIt is worth considering the possibility of the demand zone failing to hold as support, in which case it could transform into a bearish breaker, clearing the path for further losses.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price hovers around equilibrium as ETH future-based ETF filings await October verdict\n\nRipple price readies for a 20% slump\n\nRipple (XRP) price is trading within a narrow range, a move that has led to doji candlesticks forming. This repetitive pattern could see XRP continue the downtrend, going down 20% to tag the $0.5048 support level.\n\nThe position of the RSI below 50 and the AO histograms in the negative zone show that bears have the advantage, increasing the odds for a downtrend. Moreover, the Ichimoku Cloud hovering above the Ripple price action adds credence to the bearish momentum.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a break above the conversion line of the Ichimoku (blue) at $0.6315 could clear the path for Ripple price to head north, possibly reaching the cloud itself. However, Ripple price remains in murky waters unless XRP breaks about the baseline of the Ichimoku (red) at $0.6937.\n\nRipple price must decisively break past the $0.8193 for a confirmed uptrend. Such a move would constitute a 30% ascent from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP holder community confident that the altcoin is not a contract, confirmation from Attorney Jeremy Hogan"

        "title": "Bitcoin Vs. Ripple (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "The crypto market is full of exciting investments that offer you a chance to participate in the decentralized economy. As you journey deeper down the rabbit hole, you are sure to encounter Ripple (XRP). Understanding the differences between Bitcoin vs Ripple (XRP) can help you to become a better investor, as both cryptocurrencies serve very different purposes and clientele.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, was built to function as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d per Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper. This coin was built to serve the needs of the people and provide a viable alternative to the centralized banking system.\n\nWhat is Ripple?\n\nIn comparison, Ripple was designed to provide banks with decentralized financial services. The developers wanted to utilize a decentralized ledger to streamline payment settlement and asset exchanges for the traditional banking sector. While people often use the terms Ripple and XRP interchangeably, they are actually different as Ripple Labs is the company that developed the XRP cryptocurrency, its digital payment network, and protocol. The platform currently operates as a real-time gross settlement system, currency exchange, and remittance network. XRP facilitates these transactions.\n\nRippleNet\n\nRipple Labs is a member of RippleNet. RippleNet is a network of institutional payment providers located around the globe. This network has seen considerable expansion since its inception. By 2018, the network had secured over 100 banks. These banks seek to utilize Ripple to streamline their international money transfers.\n\nBitcoin Uses Cases\n\nBitcoin has two main use cases. The first is as a form of digital currency. People can send Bitcoin globally. It's borderless and immutable. There's no central organization to block or charge back your transactions. The second use case for Bitcoin is as a store of value (SoV). In its current state, Bitcoin is serving as an excellent SoV. The world's first cryptocurrency is valued at over $50,000.\n\nHowever, scalability issues have left Bitcoiners paying high fees to complete normal transactions. In this way, the coin is still seeking ways to fulfill its original purpose. Advancements, such as the off-chain protocol, the Lightning Network has helped Bitcoin better fill its role as such a system.\n\nRipple Use Cases\n\nRipple has three main use cases. Like Bitcoin, Ripple is designed to function as a payment settlement system. Ripple achieves this functionality better than Bitcoin in terms of efficiency and speed. XRP transactions complete in under a minute. Additionally, they have very little cost.\n\nIn comparison, it can take 30 minutes to hours for a Bitcoin transaction to complete. The fees you pay for the transaction will be dependent on the level of congestion on the network. Bitcoin is designed to increase its fees as more network congestion occurs. This protocol was meant to eliminate spam but recently has resulted in record-high network fees.\n\nAsset Exchange\n\nAs a second-generation cryptocurrency, Ripple has more technical functionality than Bitcoin. The network is designed to operate as a low-commission currency exchange. The protocol allows users to facilitate quick conversions between different currencies.\n\nFor example, a bank could send $1 million in USD to China without any conversion losses using RippleNet and XRP as a medium. The USD would be converted to XRP first. Then, it would be sent to China where it could then be converted into yuan. The process is faster, more secure, and cheaper than the traditional monetary system.\n\nBitcoin Consensus\n\nAnyone familiar with Bitcoin knows the network requires an enormous amount of electricity to secure. Bitcoin's energy consumption can be attributed to its Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Consensus mechanisms are how decentralized networks verify the state of the blockchain. In Bitcoin's PoW protocol, network nodes (miners) compete against each other to correctly answer a complex mathematical equation.\n\nThe first miner to answer the problem correctly gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain. They receive a reward for their efforts. The reward is currently 6.5 Bitcoin. Notably, this is the only time that Bitcoins are ever minted. This process occurs roughly every ten minutes. In this way, Bitcoin has a highly predictive monetary issuance.\n\nRipple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA)\n\nRipple utilizes a distributed ledger technology, but it\u2019s not blockchain. As such, it requires a different method to secure this network. The RPCA is a unique distributed consensus mechanism that provides Ripple with its fast transaction speeds. Instead of having all nodes approve transactions, only a select few handle this task within Ripple's decentralized ledger.\n\nParticipating nodes verify the authenticity of a transaction by conducting a poll. Since fewer nodes are required to confirm transactions, they complete much faster. Ripple is known to complete almost instant confirmations. Transactions are not affected by their size or destination either. In this way, Ripple is far more scalable than Bitcoin currently.\n\nMining\n\nXRP is pre-mined and uses a less complicated method of mining that isn't available to all users. The developers intend to release 100,000,000,000 XRP manually over the life of the project. There are around 46 billion XRP in circulation at this time. XRP operates similarly to a bank in that it can issue tokens as it deems fit. In comparison, Bitcoin pursued a more democratic and decentralized approach to coin distribution. Bitcoin's creator only pre-mined 1 million Bitcoin before opening the network to the public.\n\nBank Support\n\nSince Ripple was built to service the banking community, it obviously has far more support in the sector than Bitcoin. RippleNet brings their financial institutions together and allows them to save on their normal business practices. RippleNet has already conducted transactions on multiple banking networks. These establishments include some well-known institutions such as Santander, Axis, Bank, Yes Bank, Westpac, Union Credit, NBAD, and UBS.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nRipple has Bitcoin beat in many technical aspects. However, it lacks in other categories. For one, Ripple is highly centralized. The firm makes its development decisions at its sole discretion. Additionally, Ripple Labs own 61% of the total XRP supply. The platform's developers can decide when and how much to release.\n\nBitcoin introduces community governance in the form of miner consensus. The community debates when deciding on the future of the protocol. This approach provides regular users with more control over their investments. It also helps to prevent rug pulls.\n\nCensorship\n\nAnother concern Ripple investors must be aware of is censorship. Ripple is a privately-owned corporation. The firm has the capability to freeze, refund, or reject your transactions. In one instance, these powers were flexed on Jed McCaleb, the founder of Ripple Labs. In the occurrence, McCaleb had his sale of one million+ XRP reversed.\n\nHow Do Ripple and Bitcoin Work?\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ripple operate distributed open-source protocols. Bitcoin leverages a blockchain to provide its services whereas, Ripple introduces a decentralized ledger that serves as an intermediate mechanism of exchange between two currencies or networks. Notably, Ripple was one of the first cryptocurrencies to enter the market without a Blockchain. The RippleNet is managed by a network of independent servers which compare their transaction records.\n\nXRP\n\nXRP officially launched in 2012. It functions as the main utility token for the Ripple Network. It was purpose-built to support tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, or other units of value. The developers choose to pre-mine 1 billion XRP. This decision was seen as controversial as it provided the developers with the majority of tokens in the market. They have gradually released the funds into the market over time, but the majority still remains in the hands of early investors and developers.\n\nRipple vs Bitcoin Company\n\nRipple is a privately owned company. The goal of the project is to secure a profit and expand its network. In comparison, Bitcoin is simply a decentralized protocol. There is no Bitcoin office or CEO to contact. In this way, Bitcoin is insulated better from regulatory pushback and scrutiny.\n\nHistory of Ripple\n\nRipple (XRP) is the brainchild of Jed McCaleb. McCaleb is best known as the founder of Mt.Gox. Notably, he had already sold his shares in the exchange prior to the now infamous hack. He also co-founded several crypto startups. These firms include Stellar, eDonkey, and Overnet.\n\nMcCaleb built Ripple with the help of Arthur Britto and David Schwartz. Originally, the firm launched with the goal of providing a peer-to-peer trust network. In 2012, the team partnered with another developer by the name of Fugger. At the time, he had a project called OpenCoin which would eventually roll into Ripple. Ripple remained OpenCoin until September 2013, when it rebranded back to its original title.\n\nBy December 2014, Ripple Labs had started to secure major partnerships in the market. The firm began working with global payments service Earthport to provide a streamlined payment service to users. The RippleNet has seen rapid expansion ever since.\n\nSEC Issues\n\nNotably, in December 2020, Ripple Labs and two of its executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleged that Ripple had participated in the unregistered sale of unlicensed securities during its ICO. The trial is still ongoing in court.\n\nWhat's the Best Investment?\n\nBoth Ripple and Bitcoin offer high ROI potential. If you review past charts, it\u2019s easy to see that Bitcoin has consistently outperformed XRP in terms of ROI. However, given the growing size of Ripple's Network, there is still a possibility for major growth with this project in the coming months as well. To date, both coins are up considerably from their launch.\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP)\n\nThese are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. The exchanges below enable the purchase of both of these digital assets.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nBitcoin Vs Ripple \u2013 Two Sides of the Coin\n\nNow that you understand the key differences between Bitcoin vs Ripple, it\u2019s easy to see why both of these projects can coexist in the market. Investors will find that Bitcoin offers an excellent SoV and Ripple is a project that has a strong following in the market. For these reasons, it\u2019s not a bad decision to participate in both networks to some degree.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Bitcoin and Investing in Ripple guides."
