        "title": "XRP Will Get Relisted On Coinbase Immediately After Ripple\u2019s Victory Over SEC, Exchange\u2019s Chief Legal Officer Hints - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIf Ripple wins the case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a relisting of the coin on America\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange could ensue.\n\nCoinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal has delved into the possibility of relisting XRP in a recent interview.\n\nWill Coinbase Relist XRP Promptly?\n\nWhen the SEC filed its suit in December 2020, many pundits and observers felt it was a death knell for XRP, as the token was delisted from most crypto exchanges globally, including Coinbase. At the time, Coinbase said the move was motivated by its Digital Assets Framework policy, which assesses factors like securities compliance.\n\nSpeaking to Tony Edward \u2014 host of the Thinking Crypto podcast, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer Paul Grewal acknowledged that this delisting had been a constant source of frustration for XRP fans.\n\nWhen asked whether Coinbase is planning to relist XRP after the court\u2019s ruling in the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, Grewal noted that it would depend on the grounds of the ruling, the judge\u2019s legal reasoning, and the exchange\u2019s assessment of whether or not the apex court would uphold the decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo a lot is going to depend on the particulars of that court rules. I know that\u2019s not going to be terribly satisfying to some, but we do have a responsibility as a publicly listed company to tread carefully in this area and with respect to any token that\u2019s a subject of federal court litigation,\u201d the CLO explained.\n\nHe, however, assured XRP holders that Coinbase would immediately begin the review process as soon as the ruling was made.\n\n\u201cBut I am very eager as anyone else to see how the court rules and what I can say, as soon as we have the ruling, we will put in our process to see if we need to revisit our listing decision.\u201d\n\nCoinbase Exec Praises Ripple\u2019s Attorneys Ahead Of Crucial Court Ruling\n\nYou might recall that Coinbase petitioned a federal court for permission to back Ripple\u2019s case against the SEC.\n\nIn his latest interview, Paul Grewal commended the incredible work of Ripple\u2019s legal team. \u201cI certainly paid attention to the fact that the defendants in this case have done a masterful job of pushing the SEC and raising serious questions about the SEC\u2019s entire theory,\u201d the CLO posited.\n\nGrewal revealed that these efforts by Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty and others at the San Francisco-based payments firm prompted Coinbase to file a friend of the court (\u201camicus\u201d) brief in the long-standing suit between the XRP progenitor and the SEC.\n\nLike most people in the crypto community, Grewal is impatiently awaiting a decision in the case, and he is optimistic that the judge will rule in Ripple\u2019s favour.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously speculated that the suit could be wrapped up by June but admitted that is only a guess."

        "content": "A cancer diagnosis affects all aspects of life. While doctors and nurses care for a patient\u2019s physical symptoms, there is so much more that goes into patient- and family-centered care. At Moffitt Cancer Center, specially trained social workers are essential to providing the support, guidance and resources needed to help cope with and manage so many aspects that come with a diagnosis of cancer.\n\nSocial workers can help you with:\n\nUnderstanding emotions and ways to cope\n\nManaging changes to relationships and family\n\nTalking to children about a parent\u2019s diagnosis\n\nDiscussing and completing an advance directive\n\nPlanning for end of life by creating a legacy for loved ones\n\nReferral to Moffitt and community resources to help with support, home care, medical equipment, food, transportation, lodging and financial assistance\n\n\u201cWe walk alongside the patients and their caregivers in understanding their cancer journey in the context of their life and the world around them,\u201d said Donna DiClementi, manager of Outpatient Social Work at Moffitt. \u201cThey\u2019re not cancer patients to us. They\u2019re people living with cancer and that\u2019s a huge difference.\u201d\n\nDuring a patient\u2019s clinic appointments and when they are admitted to Moffitt, a trained team member will ask about their distress and coping. If there are concerns that cause distress, they will offer the services of our clinical social workers to make sure patients can get the help they need.\n\nWorking with Health Care Providers\n\nMoffitt\u2019s social workers collaborate with health care providers by giving them critical information about the patient that the providers may not know, which impacts their care.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re people who have full, rich lives outside of their diagnosis,\u201d DiClementi said. \u201cWe get to learn all about that and how the diagnosis is impacting their body, mind and spirit.\u201d\n\nDr. Damon Reed is an oncologist in Moffitt\u2019s Department of Individualized Cancer Management and the director of the Adolescent and Young Adult Program. He\u2019s seen firsthand the way Moffitt\u2019s social workers care for patients of all ages.\n\n\u201cCancer is bad enough for its physical nature of causing pain and discomfort and threatening patients\u2019 lives, but there is unfortunately much more that it can cause,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThe emotional toll it takes on patients and their support systems is massive. Social workers consider all of the \u2018human\u2019 factors that cancer affects to improve patient and family cancer journeys. They anticipate bumps in the road, alleviate financial stressors and guide patients by addressing their worries.\u201d\n\nSocial workers consider all of the \u2018human\u2019 factors that cancer affects to improve patient and family cancer journeys. They anticipate bumps in the road, alleviate financial stressors, and guide patients by addressing their worries. Dr. Damon Reed\n\nWhy Are Social Workers Essential?\n\nDr. Pam Hodul\n\n\u201cSocial workers are essential in that they complement the complex care requirements of our high acuity patients and address the emotional concerns of our patients and families,\u201d said Dr. Pam Hodul, a gastrointestinal surgeon at Moffitt.\n\nA person living with cancer is also concerned about COVID-19, possibly missing work, the impact the disease has on their children and their support system. It\u2019s the role of the social worker to assist the patient in alleviating these worries.\n\nDr. Philippe Spiess is the assistant chief of Surgical Services and senior member of the Department of Genitourinary Oncology at Moffitt. He\u2019s seen an increase in the supportive needs of his patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDr. Philippe Spiess\n\n\"The level of understanding and engagement of our social workers, always being committed to addressing all of our patients\u2019 emotional needs, has been instrumental in allowing us to care for our patients through these truly unprecedented times,\u201d Spiess said. \u201cThis global pandemic has created additional barriers and challenges for our patients and their families. It is truly remarkable that we have such an engaged social work team always meeting the needs of our patients, and they without question deserve recognition for all their efforts and achievements.\u201d"

        "content": "In \u201cHoosier Hysteria\u201d lore, there are not many more famous shots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard about it 1,000 times,\u201d Lutheran senior K.J. Patterson said with a smile.\n\nOn the scale of jaw-dropping, did-that-just-happen moments, Stacey Toran\u2019s three-quarter court last-second heave to push Broad Ripple past No. 1 Marion 71-69 in the morning game of the state finals in 1980 has to rank near the top.\n\nK.J. Patterson\u2019s brother, Kam, had his own moment in last week\u2019s Class A regional at Martinsville, scoring on a three-point play with 3 seconds left as Lutheran knocked off top-ranked Bloomfield 43-40.\n\nNeddenriep:A story about family, 3-pointers, underdogs and 'Hoosiers'\n\nMore:Often ignored for jobs, Jim Stanbrough gets chance... at 67. He's making up for lost time.\n\nThe two moments, nearly 43 years apart, are connected by family. K.J. Patterson, who bears a striking resemblance to Toran, and twin brother Kam, are Toran\u2019s grand-nephews. Their grandmother, Cynthia, was Toran\u2019s older sister. She died in 2019, but their grandfather, Royal Patterson, has kept memories of Stacey Toran and that moment in 1980 alive.\n\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d been there to visualize it,\u201d K.J. Patterson said. \u201cBut it always meant a lot to us to hear what he did in basketball and football and who he was as a person.\u201d\n\nToran was a senior starter on Broad Ripple\u2019s team in 1980, already committed to Notre Dame for football. New Albany, a 69-68 winner over Andrean in the thrilling first game of the state finals, awaited the winner of the Broad Ripple-Marion winner in the state championship game.\n\nIn a back-and-forth game, Marion tied it 69-69 with 1 second remaining when Jeff Todd slipped through the Rockets\u2019 zone to tie the score. But instead of the game going to overtime, Marion called timeout and left Broad Ripple with one final attempt.\n\nIt was all Broad Ripple needed. Needing to go the length of the floor, Jeffrey Adkisson surveyed the scene before flipping a pass to Toran, who caught the ball, turned without dribbling and let it fly with two hands from 57 feet. It banked through, sending Broad Ripple fans into hysterics and Marion\u2019s to tears.\n\nBroad Ripple went on to defeat New Albany that night, 73-66, to win the state championship. Lutheran coach Remus Woods, who graduated from Broad Ripple in 2000, learned about the 1980 team from coach Bill Smith.\n\n\u201cI helped him in the summer time and while we were doing our work, he would watch these old VHS tapes with King Duke, Kevin Tracey, Jeff Robinson, Stacey Toran and that team,\u201d Woods said. \u201cHe talked about how athletic Stacey Toran was and how he could guard the best players and was really strong in basketball and football.\u201d\n\nToran\u2019s story ended in tragedy. After his college career at Notre Dame, he was drafted in the sixth round by the Los Angeles Raiders in 1984. He became a regular in the Raiders\u2019 secondary, playing 72 games with 41 starts in five seasons, making nine sacks, six interceptions and scoring two touchdowns.\n\nAfter a preseason game on Aug. 6, 1989, Toran was driving near his home in Marina del Rey, Calif., when his car flipped multiple times and crashed into a tree, killing him. Toran was 27.\n\nFuneral services for Toran were held five days later in the gym at Broad Ripple, where he had been captain of the football and basketball teams.\n\n\u201cI see him as a role model,\u201d K.J. Patterson said. \u201cTo be an athlete, I want to make it too. I think he\u2019s part of the reason we are here where we are today.\u201d\n\nThe Pattersons have their own Hoosier Hysteria moment to share now though, unlike their great uncle, they have three more games \u2014 not one \u2014 to earn the state championship. Lutheran plays Loogootee Saturday in the Class A semistate in Washington and, with a win, would face the winner of Rock Creek Academy and Jac-Cen-Del on Saturday night with a state finals bid on the line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great moment for their family,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize the connection until I met Kam and K.J. when they were in about fourth grade. Their grandfather told me their relation to Stacey Toran. I was like, \u2018Oh, I used to watch him on VHS tapes with Bill Smith.\u2019\u201d\n\nCall Star reporter Kyle Neddenriep at (317) 444-6649."

        "content": "Crypto exchange Coinbase could relist XRP if Ripple wins against the SEC \u2013 Paul Grewal is optimistic.\n\nThe exchange will initiate the review process immediately after the ruling.\n\nXRP is up 2.1% in the last 24 hours after reclaiming the $0.3649 support level.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase delisted XRP in January 2021 after the SEC filed its case against the Ripple network. Despite vocal appeals by the Ripple community to have the token relisted, Coinbase remained unmoved.\n\nAs recently reported, LBRY Inc also called for XRP relisting on Coinbase. The reaffirmation of its support for XRP came after the SEC settled its lawsuit against LBRY Inc, with the presiding District Judge concluding that LBC tokens sold in the secondary market are not securities.\n\nCoinbase should relist $XRP.\n\n\n\nUnder the SEC vs LBRY standard, $XRP sold by secondary holders is not a security. \u2014 LBRY (@LBRYcom) February 1, 2023\n\nXRP price has reacted positively to the development, rising over 2% to reclaim the $0.3649 support level. The uptrend comes despite the current mood in the market after several collapses in the banking sector and the debacle that befell USDC stablecoin.\n\nCoinbase CLO optimistic about Ripple win\n\nHowever, in a March 16 interview with Thinking Crypto host Tony Edward, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer (CLO) Paul Grewal said that if Ripple wins its lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the largest American crypto exchange will relist XRP token.\n\nGrewal spoke in detail about the matter, expressing his optimism for a Ripple win. However, he also noted that a relisting does not depend solely on the question of a court victory as there might be other factors that could come into play, including the exact details of the court judgment.\n\nThe Coinbase CLO revealed that the exchange makes regular evaluations of assets for listing, delisting, and pausing, noting that they were cognizant of the frustration of the XRP community.\n\nI know that for many XRP holders, it has been frustrating that they have not been able to trade their assets on Coinbase while this SEC case has been pending.\n\nBefore explaining what the process of relisting XRP would look like, Grewal said that he was eager for the ruling, lauding the work of Ripple\u2019s lawyers in the highest terms. He said, \u201cI carefully paid attention to the fact that the defendants, in this case, have done a masterful job of pushing the SEC and raising serious questions about the SEC\u2019s entire theory.\u201d\n\nNotably, Coinbase had also filed an amicus brief to support several defenses presented by the Ripple lawyers. Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty and his team at the fintech company have done an \u201cincredible job,\u201d which explains Grewal\u2019s confidence about the court\u2019s ruling favoring Ripple.\n\nWe\u2019ll see that the SEC theories have serious issues. I think the briefing, in this case, has been excellent, and we are all going to find out soon what the trial judges think of the arguments.\n\nNevertheless, Grewal also noted that the Southern District Court of New York\u2019s decision would only be the first step in a longer process. In his opinion, the chances of an appeal remain high for both parties regardless of who wins in court.\n\nCoinbase exchange to relist XRP\n\nGrewal did not shy away from giving a possible timeline of XRP relisting on the exchange. While he did not give an exact date, the Coinbase CLO said it depends on \u201cthe grounds of the ruling, the judge\u2019s legal reasoning, and Coinbase\u2019s assessment of whether or not the appeals court will uphold the decision.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging that his response was not entirely satisfactory, Grewal said that as a publicly listed company, Coinbase needs to tread with caution on this matter, respecting every token that is a subject of federal court litigation.\n\nNevertheless, Grewal assured Coinbase would immediately kickstart the review process once the court rules.\n\nBut I am very eager as anyone else to see how the court rules and what I can say, as soon as we have the ruling, we will put in our process to see if we need to revisit our listing decision.\n\nXRP price on a rise\n\nXRP price has already reacted to this news, soaring 2.13% in the last 24 hours to auction for $0.3711 against the US Dollar at press time. The token is on course to confront the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.3798, which could pave the way for more gains if breached.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nAlong with the hope of a relisting, the XRP community is also elated about the network\u2019s recent partnership and investment with a Singaporean-based venture capital fund to accelerate Web3 adoption.\n\nHowever, if the FUD of the crypto market caused by banking sector woes takes precedence, XRP price could decline, potentially below the immediate support at $0.3649."

Medical debt is high in North Carolina; Medicaid expansion could help\n\nAs North Carolina leaders inch closer to finally expanding Medicaid, their final passage won't eliminate the buildup of future debt.\n\nAs North Carolina leaders inch closer to finally expanding Medicaid, their final passage won't eliminate the buildup of future debt.\n\nAs North Carolina leaders inch closer to finally expanding Medicaid, their final passage won't eliminate the buildup of future debt.\n\nAs North Carolina leaders inch closer to finally expanding Medicaid, their final passage won't eliminate the buildup of future debt.\n\nThe ripple effect of medical bills is something Durham resident Kerry Holbrook knows all too well.\n\n\"Anybody who has ever had cancer and gone to treatment knows that once you have cancer, you are bankrupt,\" she said.\n\nShe's had breast cancer and too many surgeries to count. Now she's overcoming hearing impairments and mental health challenges. For years, she worked two part-time jobs without health insurance.\n\nHolbrook estimates she has hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical debt but she's lost count.\n\n\"We just laughed about how we stacked our bills up on the table. And then we threw it in the trash. Because what else are you gonna do with it?\" Holbrook remembered.\n\nThere isn't any relief in sight for Holbrook but her needs don't stop. Recently, she had to open a credit card to afford new hearing aids.\n\n\"I couldn't do $7,000, you know? I mean, how am I supposed to pay for that? And so I opened up the credit card and from there you know, I mean, it just it's a ripple effect,\" she explained.\n\nShe isn't the only one facing mounting bills. When people can't pay their bills, their credit suffers and it goes on to impact other facets of their lives.\n\n\"It makes you feel bad; it makes you feel like you can't take care of yourself,\" Holbrook said.\n\nLower credit scores and high medical debt are both plaguing southern states.\n\nA 2021 JAMA study found some patients in primarily southern counties can face medical debt six times higher than in other areas of the country.\n\nThe Urban Institute estimated the average medical debt in collections for North Carolinians is $757. Along the same lines, the institute reported the average credit score in the state is 2% lower than the national average.\n\nThe 2021 JAMA study found medical debt decreased by 44% between 2013 and 2020 in states that expanded Medicaid as opposed to only a 10% drop in states that did not.\n\nThe burden of medical debt is something Rev. Mindy Douglas, the pastor at First Presbyterian Church, is trying to lessen in North Carolina.\n\nLast year her congregation started a campaign with RIP Medical Debt and was able to help pay off $5 million of medical debt for North Carolina patients. While the church hopes to raise money for another medical debt campaign soon, Douglas said, she is hoping lawmakers finalize Medicaid expansion soon.\n\n\"This is something that we as a church community have been pushing for a long time because we need to take care of the health care of all of the people not just some of the people,\" Douglas said. \"There too many people who are not going to the doctor when they need to, who are not receiving significant treatments that they need to, who are not having the medications that they need, because they can't afford it.\"\n\nAs North Carolina leaders inch closer to finally expanding Medicaid, their final passage won't eliminate the buildup of future debt.\n\nApril Cook, CEO of the North Carolina Association of Free & Charitable Clinics, said around 700,000 people will still be left uninsured across the state.\n\n\"Medicaid will take care of individuals up to 138% of federal poverty, that those that are living at 139% to 250% are the working poor,\" Cook explained. \"A single person making $19,000 will not qualify for Medicaid.\"\n\nShe said that is where the 71 free and charitable clinics across North Carolina will be needed. One of those clinics is Alliance Medical Ministry in Wake County.\n\n\"We have a waiting list of patients to begin with us. We're at capacity,\" explained Alliance Medical Ministry executive director Pete Tannenbaum.\n\nThe clinic provides holistic care to uninsured patients to help prevent their conditions from leading to major needs and subsequently large bills. Tannenbaum said they have around 2,200 patients but the need is growing.\n\n\"If we're not able to expand our patients, more than half they would either not receive care or they would go to the emergency room for basic primary care. Our patients have chronic diseases that are treatable. And that's what we do,\" Tannenbaum said.\n\nCook estimated the free and charitable clinics across the state saved hospital systems $369 million from emergency room diversion costs.\n\n\"The association saw about 100,000 uninsured folks last year if there's 700,000 remaining our work is still we've got a job to do,\" Cook said.\n\nWhile the clinics have received funding over the past few years through COVID relief funds, continual funding will be needed.\n\nRELATED\n\nNC Medicaid expansion offers a potential lifeline for people struggling with drug addiction\n\nMedicaid expansion is another step closer to becoming reality for thousands of low-income North Carolinians with no health insurance.\n\n'Falling through the cracks': Lack of rural health transportation options puts family in bad spot\n\nTransportation rises to one of the top healthcare concerns for people living in rural communities.\n\nHealthcare shortages leave patients behind"
