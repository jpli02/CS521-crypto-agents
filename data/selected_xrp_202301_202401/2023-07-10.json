        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 BRICS stands for the Broad Ripple Ice Cream Station, and it\u2019s a name that pays homage to the building\u2019s history as the original Monon train station in Broad Ripple.\n\n\u201cIt's just a great old building,\u201d Jay Hill, assistant manager of BRICS, said.\n\nThe ice cream shop opened in 2010 and Hill began scooping sweet treats the following year.\n\n\u201cThree of the four original owners were students of mine,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI retired from teaching and didn't want to sit at home, so I asked them if they'd be interested in me working.\u201d\n\nAnd while you can take the teacher out of the school, you can\u2019t take the \"call to teach\" out of the teacher.\n\n\u201cI really enjoy working with all the young kids that this is their first job,\u201d Hill said.\n\nBRICS always carries at least 30 different flavors of dairy-based ice cream.\n\n\u201cYellow Cake Batter is our most popular flavor,\u201d Hill said. But the popularity extends well beyond traditional ice cream.\n\n\u201cWe also offer eight vegan flavors which we make ourselves,\u201d Hill said.\n\nA few of the oat-milk-based ice cream flavors include Chocolate, Birthday Cake, Vanilla, Strawberry and Mint Chip. BRICS also has a dairy-free Raspberry Sorbet.\n\nThe ice cream at BRICS goes beyond tasting good according to Hill. The owners also use it to do good in the community.\n\n\u201cI can't tell you how much ice cream we donate over a week or a month or a year. I mean, it's an extraordinary amount of ice cream,\u201d Hill said. It's a really cool part of working here that you get to be a part of this outreach to the community.\u201d\n\nBRICS Indy\n\n901 East 64th Street\n\nIndianapolis\n\n(317) 257-5757\n\n"

        "content": "The Bank of America (BofA) says that Ripple is an example of a company that is making an impact with blockchain and its use case for cross-border payments.\n\nIn a recent report, BofA analysts say Ripple is an exception to blockchain\u2019s relatively modest effect on international payments systems, particularly in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.\n\n\u201cAnother technology that is having an effect on real-time activity in APAC, albeit to a lesser degree than APIs (application programming interface), is blockchain. It\u2019s used as an underlying security measure in certain transactions, but it\u2019s not having the level of success that its preceding hype had suggested, notes Venkat.\n\nIt has played an important role in helping to digitize trade documentation, as the technical basis of the smart contract, but in cross-border payments, the work of Ripple is a possible exception, its impact has been limited, he comments. The reason for this is the rapid emergence of SWIFT GPI (global payments innovation) as the favored solution for tracking and tracing cross-border payments.\u201d\n\nThe banking giant also says that APAC, as one of the main regions blazing a trail in financial technology, is likely on a path toward abandoning physical cash.\n\n\u201cBy presenting every digital option, from consumer payments via QR codes on mobile devices, to real-time corporate treasury and wholesale settlements, to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and crypto, APAC is heralding new opportunities for all stakeholders to finally abandon hard cash.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Mon 10 Jul 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe recent disclosure of Hinman\u2019s documents reversed expectations of a Ripple victory against the SEC. Despite this, some believe the firm\u2019s native crypto has significant upside potential.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP price set to reach $10\n\nCrypto company Ripple\u2019s chances of winning its case against the SEC have been dwindling. Ever since the disappointing disclosure of the Hinman documents, considered for several months to be the key to the trial.\n\nNevertheless, crypto analyst Crypto Assets Guy believes that XRP, Ripple\u2019s native token, is not to be buried. In his opinion, the asset is still in line for a price explosion. It is expected to rise to $3.5, then $10, from its current level of around $0.50.\n\nThe surge in XRP\u2019s price, despite the current legal context, is due to a combination of factors. The first of these is the fact that the crypto is now available on certain exchanges. In particular, those that delisted it.\n\nCrypto Analyst Reveals His Bullish Case For $XRP to Surge to $10 in the Future https://t.co/VOLy4e3f5Q \u2014 monty7 (@montyworld7) July 8, 2023\n\nA second circumstance could impact XRP\u2019s price valuation, according to Crypto Assets Guy. This is the possible IPO of Ripple, which could trigger a new wave of crypto bullishness. This trend is likely to strengthen as the crypto company ramps up strategic collaborations with banking institutions.\n\nAdmittedly, these predictions are essentially subjective. In view of the weight and circumstances of the crypto market, their realization remains essentially hypothetical, if not questionable.\n\nNevertheless, JackTheRippler, another crypto analyst, sees XRP reaching a valuation of $1,000. His projection, which understates that of Crypto Assets Guy, has delighted many XRP supporters.\n\nFor many others, it would take a miracle for such expectations to materialize. Perhaps the crypto whales hold the secret to the latter? Last month, when the XRP collapsed, many of them pounced on it. They offered themselves up to 360 million XRP.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program! Earn points for each article you read and gain access to exclusive rewards.

        "title": "Black Hole Flares Up, Causing Ripple in Space-Time \u00bb Explorersweb - ExplorersWeb",
        "content": "Astronomers may have come across something extraordinary. A supermassive black hole \u201cswitched on\u201d to become one of the brightest transient objects ever detected.\n\nThe gigantic black hole is approximately 10 billion light years away from Earth. Astronomers first spotted J221951 in 2019, but the research on it has only just become public.\n\nBecause the black hole is so far away, the event would actually have occurred when the universe was only one quarter of its current age.\n\nA team of astronomers led by researchers from @unibirmingham, @ucl, and @QUBelfast have discovered one of the most dramatic \u2018switches on\u2019 of a black hole ever seen. They will present their findings today at #NAM2023 in Cardiff. pic.twitter.com/6RSx0fpONi \u2014 Royal Astronomical Society (@RoyalAstroSoc) July 4, 2023\n\nThe discovery began when the researchers came across the path of a gravitational wave \u2014 a ripple in space-time from a collision in space. They began searching for a kilonova, an explosion that occurs when two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole merge.\n\nBut it soon became clear that J221951 was something else. Kilonovas are blue and fade to red in a few days. This stayed bright blue for months. A single explosion could not have caused it.\n\nSeveral telescopes observed the mysterious object for months. It lined up almost perfectly with the center of another galaxy. This suggested that it could be a supermassive black hole like Sagittarius A*, the one at the core of our own galaxy.\n\nTen months after it suddenly lit up, it started to fade. This showed that it wasn\u2019t the center of a galaxy, bur rather a transient object in space. Astronomers believe that they were watching a black hole \u201cswitch on.\u201d Black holes can switch on and off during their lifetime. It depends how much matter is available for them to feed on.\n\nTwo possible triggers\n\nThere are two possible triggers for the event. The first is that the previously dormant black hole became active and started rapidly feeding on the surrounding matter. No one is sure why this happens.\n\nThe second is that a tidal disruption event occurred. In this scenario, a star passed too close to the hole. Its tidal forces ripped it apart, then the black hole consumed it.\n\nScientists will continue to monitor it. If it lights up again, the cause is likely the first trigger \u2014 that every time the hole starts feeding, it lights up. However, if it continues to fade, then the other possible cause, the tearing apart of a star, is more likely.\n\n\u201cOur understanding of the different things that supermassive black holes can do has greatly expanded in recent years, with discoveries of stars being torn apart and accreting black holes with hugely variable luminosities,\u201d said astronomer and co-author Matt Nicholl. \u201cJ221951 is one of the most extreme examples yet of a black hole taking us by surprise.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin price could breach the $30,500 hurdle if it holds above the local low of $29,950.\n\nEthereum price looks ready for another leg higher above $2,000 as ETH gains pace against the USDT.\n\nRipple price shows investors are not trading the intermediate with possible entry and exit points at $0.448 and $0.506, respectively.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is bullish on the lower timeframe, but there is no actionable price action in the higher timeframe. Without a proper catalyst in individual ecosystems, Ethereum (ETH) price is moving in tandem with BTC, steadily gaining ground as the broader market braces for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading scheduled for July 12. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price is moving within a steady range as market participants plan their next move.\n\nAlso Read: Will altcoin investments pay out in third quarter of 2023?\n\nBitcoin price braces for the CPI week\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price shows an actionable price move in the one-hour chart for the BTC/USDT 1-hour trading pair. This is unlike the one-day timeframe, where you can assume a stagnating market. The king of crypto remains bullish after flipping the 50-, 100-, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) hurdles at $30,252, $30,296, and $30,344 into support.\n\nHowever, experts anticipate a prolonged drag until the CPI inspires some volatility. Based on popular opinion, the report could come in at 3.1%, an outcome that could trigger a rally for the flagship crypto.\n\nA positive reading could see Bitcoin price break the range, potentially breaching the $30,500 mark to record a new range high.\n\nThe Fibonacci Retracement indicator shows that Bitcoin price is likely to head north toward the 50% Fib at $30,727. This outlook is supported by the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO), moving up to show rising momentum.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-hour Chart\n\nHowever, the influence of macroeconomics like CPI has sort of dried up over time, meaning BTC could continue the dull price action or succumb to investor greed and head south.\n\nAlso Read: CPI meets low BTC supply \u2013 Five things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nEthereum price gains pace against USDT\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is sitting above the 50-day EMA at $1,852, with momentum indicators pointing to a rising momentum. The PoS token is gaining momentum against Tether (USDT), recording a daily rise of almost 2% and almost 10% over the last month. A sustained increase in buying pressure could see ETH breach the immediate barricade at $1,959 before confronting the $2,000 level.\n\nThe AO, an indicator histogram that compares and displays market momentum, is trading above the zero line to show Ethereum price is still bullish. Similarly, the RSI is edging north, pointing to a growing momentum.\n\nBitcoin price recording a potetial fresh increase, possibly catalyzed by the oncoming macroeconomic report, could increase the chances for the upside as the overflows of a BTC rally often bode well for Ethereum price.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, a rejection from the $1,959 hurdle could send Ethereum price below the support offered by the 50-day EMA.\n\nAlso Read: Veteran trader Peter Brandt calls Binance \u2018scam of the decade\u2019 as Bitcoin, Ethereum trade at discount\n\nRipple price to record significant moves upon breaking the intermediate\n\nRipple (XRP) price points to a market where traders are reluctant to make moves as XRP continues moving within a zone. The complacency comes as community members grow weary of a long-overdue judgment in the network\u2019s case against the US SEC.\n\nThe resistance at $0.506 and the support at $0.444 has the remittance token caught in a bound, possibly as investors plan the ideal entry or exit points. An increase in buyer momentum could see Ripple price rise 5% above the current market position of $0.478 to fight off the $0.506. With investor greed in check, XRP could extend further toward the $542 level.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nNevertheless, the $0.506 range could also be the ideal exit points for investors booking early profits. The ensuing selling pressure could send Ripple price southward to find support at $0.444.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple price suffers the aftermath of Hinman email failure as the XRP hype train dissipates"
