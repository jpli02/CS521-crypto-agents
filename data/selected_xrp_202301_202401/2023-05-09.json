        "content": "Ripple\u2019s ongoing case against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to determine if its native token XRP is a security, might not be as strong as it believes \u2014 due to its management of popular Unique Node Lists (UNLs).\n\nUNLs act as gatekeepers on who can participate in XRP\u2019s consensus mechanisms. Users can modify their UNL to prefer certain nodes, and almost every user opts into a UNL that the Ripple-backed XRP Foundation maintains.\n\nThe XRP network can also eject a user if the user\u2019s UNL doesn\u2019t have enough overlap with other UNLs. Again, because Ripple operates UNLs with commanding popularity, it controls the cooperation rates of other UNLs.\n\nThe XRP Foundation operates its own UNLs, maintaining \u2018master lists\u2019 of trusted third parties that it allows to contribute to the consensus mechanism.\n\nThe XRP Foundation controls a default UNL \u2014 which is opted into by default, as the name suggests \u2014 known as dUNL.\n\nIt also maintains a second UNL called XRPLF.\n\nCoil had maintained a third UNL for the XRP Foundation but the firm went bankrupt, leaving just those two.\n\nThe XRP Foundation can modify these UNLs at any time, kicking off nodes that don\u2019t follow its rules \u2014 and can potentially penalize users who connect to them for circumstances outside their control.\n\nSEC cites UNLs in XRP security complaint\n\nThe SEC cites the centralized nature of UNLs in its argument that XRP is a security. \u201cDuring the process to achieve consensus with respect to a new proposed state of the XRP Ledger, each server on the network evaluates proposed transactions from a subset of servers it trusts not to defraud it, also known as the server\u2019s UNL,\u201d reads page eight of the SEC\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cWhile each server defines its own trusted servers, the XRP Ledger requires a high degree of overlap between the trusted nodes chosen by each server. Ripple thus publishes its own proposed UNL. Approximately 40% of the nodes validating transactions on the XRP Ledger are operated by organizations or entities based in the United States, including Ripple itself.\u201d\n\nNaturally, Ripple denies that XRP is centralized. It claims that it can democratize its transaction validation process by removing incentives to accumulate hashrate in a mining pool to find a block the fastest.\n\nRead more: SEC vs Ripple: Two-year crypto beef could soon be settled\n\nThe crypto firm claims that UNLs merely give users a way to avoid a situation in which they\u2019re forced to use a validator with enough nodes to exert too much influence over the network. It did acknowledge running its own validators, but claims it only operates 10 of them.\n\nHowever, it rarely addresses the existence of dUNL and XRPLF, specifically. These two master UNLs could damage its defense against the SEC\u2019s allegations that Ripple and its co-founders conducted an unregistered securities sale when they sold XRP. UNLs are critical to understanding why XRP might pass the \u201cthrough the efforts of others\u201d prong of the Howey Test.\n\nQuotes in bold are our emphasis. Got a tip?

Her work has been produced by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Kansas City Repertory Theatre, the Geva Theatre Center, and Yale Repertory Theatre, among others. She is the recipient of both the 2022 Horton Foote Prize and the Arthur Miller Legacy Award. A MacDowell fellow and New Dramatists resident, Anderson has taught playwriting at the David Geffen Yale School of Drama, Wesleyan University, and SUNY Purchase, and was the interim head of playwriting at Brown University.

The ATCA also presented citations to Suzan-Lori Parks for Sally and Tom, which was produced by the Guthrie Theater, and to Rebecca Gilman for Swing State, which was produced by the Goodman. Both citations come with a $7,500 award. Additionally, the ATCA presented the M. Elizabeth Osborn Award to Madison Fiedler for her play Spay, which premiered at the Rivendell Theatre Ensemble. The Osborn Award, which come with a $3,000 prize, recognizes the work of an emerging writer who has not yet received a major national award or New York City production.\n\nATCA began honoring new plays produced at regional theatres outside New York City in 1977, and awards $40,000 in annual prizes. The awards have been funded the Harold and Mimi Steinberg Charitable Trust since 2000. The trust was created in 1986 by Harold Steinberg on behalf of himself and his late wife to support the American theatre.\n\nThe American Theatre Critics Association is the only national association of professional theatre critics in the United States. Since its founding in 1974, the ATCA has worked to foster greater communication among theatre critics and emerging writers, and to provide opportunities for members to explore the artistic resources of the nation.\n\nSupport American Theatre: a just and thriving theatre ecology begins with information for all.
