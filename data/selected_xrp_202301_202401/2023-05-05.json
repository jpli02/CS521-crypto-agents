        "title": "JOSEPH's 'Ripple Effect' for 'The Sun' to Come to Light - Aquarian Weekly",
        "content": "Coming off of release week for album that is as sentimental as it is vulnerable, equal parts touching and motivational, and more grounded than most could understand is JOSEPH \u2013 a band who heals alongside all of us.\n\nAll sister trio JOSEPH have swept the Pacific Northwest with their sweet harmonies since 2014. The three, from Portland, have also succumbed to the pressures of the music industry. Natalie Closner-Schepman and twins Allison Closner and Meegan Closner were ready to call it quits during the pandemic. Then, after ironing out some essentials and regrouping both internally and externally, they turned things around to make The Sun. \u201cWe had a moment a couple of years ago before we started writing this new record. It was a moment of what we all wanted to recommit and allow ourselves to leave the band if we chose to do so,\u201d Allison explains to The Aquarian.\n\n\u201cHaving that conversation and putting it on the table was the healing. The three of us can keep on and carry on so to speak. It\u2019s a lot to tour and being gone from your life. It allowed us to keep going, though,\u201d adds Natalie. \u201cIt then went into this new album a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe day-to-day traumas, whether it be on the road or in the studio, is what lead to the doubling down on whether or not they still wanted to be in a band. One thing they had to make sure was that this decision wasn\u2019t going to affect their sisterly bond. \u201cThe most important thing here is our relationships as sisters and family. The question [was], \u2018Could we maintain the band and maintain our relationship?\u2019 The answer was yes \u2013 it just took a lot of conversations to get to that point,\u201d admits Meegan.\n\nThe result is The Sun, a sonically new and incredible fourth effort. According to Natalie, \u201cWe made this album in our hometown. We explored different sounds with producers Tucker Martine and Joey Burns. As we kept going, we invited British rocker Leggy Langdon and Seattle\u2019s Deep Sea Diver to be involved. It was a wild journey, but we wanted to remain true to the songs each step of the way,\u201d says Natalie.\n\nThe first single for The Sun, out now, was \u201cNervous System.\u201d Amazing imagery filled the music video, but it may puzzle the viewer if you don\u2019t innately relate, but it all comes down to Allison\u2019s past anxieties. She gives voice to this: \u201cThe whole song is about my experience with anxiety and finding the power within myself to be ok, finding my strength and compass. One of the things that helped me a lot in my journey was Panic Free TV. One of the analogies is that they compared your anxiety to a smoke alarm. It\u2019s basically a false alarm if you have a piece of toast that gets burned in the toaster and that ends up smoking. That\u2019s what your anxiety is \u2013 just a false alarm. You come to realize your alarm is still working and that it\u2019s not an actual emergency. I loved that. As we were making the video, I pitched the burnt toast, and it tied in pretty good.\u201d\n\nNatalie adds, \u201cThe visuals were designed by Clifton Chandler and worked off a brain scan. It\u2019s a literal image of a brain. The marbles are coming from the thought of \u2018losing your marbles.\u2019 It\u2019s your mind deciding and its not ignoring it \u2013 grab it and [assess] what is going on and bring it back into your own power.\u201d Meegan amplifies this; \u201cThe marbles acknowledged the journey and thread of the whole song.\u201d\n\nTheir second single, title track \u201cThe Sun,\u201d is a bright ditty that deals with darkness at some points due to its lyrical content. \u201cThe song \u2018The Sun\u2019 comes from my story of having come out of a relationship and being taken down a few notches from it,\u201d notes Meegan. \u201cIt\u2019s about relearning that my goodness doesn\u2019t come from someone else saying that I am good. I want people to feel the victory in it. I am really happy with the way it came out.\u201d\n\nBefore The Sun was out as a whole, \u201cFireworks\u201d became the third tune that fans were able to hear and further feel out the album with. They explain that it\u2019s a song about \u201cnot wanting to settle and wanting more \u2013 whether it\u2019s in love life or for your life in general.\u201d\n\nNow that this record is out, though, audiences have leaned more into it and JOSEPH\u2019s folk pop style. \u201cWe really do like pop music, but we never wanted to be like everyone else,\u201d Meegan tells us. \u201cWe hope our music is pop enough, but that it\u2019s unique enough that you think, \u2018I\u2019ve never heard anything like this.'\u201d\n\nWith originality on the mind and coming from the Portland area, the trio suggest Deep Sea Diver and Mini Trees to listen to next for more cool new sounds in a similar vein\u2026 but New York is never not on their mind. \u201cWe\u2019ve had really good experiences in New York,\u201d they say, and the Bowery Ballroom and Music Hall of Williamsburg are some of the band\u2019s favorite NYC venues. Come June you can support these sisters at Irving Plaza, as well, when they bring The Sun to life on stage.\n\nTHE SUN IS OUT NOW WHEREVER YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC! FOR MORE ON JOSEPH, CLICK HERE!"

        "title": "Sudan's conflict will have a ripple effect in an unstable region - and across the world - The Conversation",
        "content": "Sudan, Africa\u2019s third largest country by land mass, shares borders with seven countries in an unstable region. This means that Sudan\u2019s current conflict will have economic, social and political ripple effects across a number of countries, including the Central African Republic, Egypt, Libya, Chad, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea.\n\nThe conflict might also affect countries further afield, including the US, Russia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia, which have close economic ties with Sudan. It could destabilise the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa and jeopardise US interests in these regions. It could also delay the ratification, by the yet-to-be-formed legislative assembly, of the agreement for Russia to build a naval base at Port Sudan. Finally, the conflict could interfere with trade between Sudan and the Gulf states \u2013 the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSudan\u2019s top exports are gold, which earned a total of US$2.85 billion in 2021, groundnuts (US$488 million), crude oil (US$385 million), and sheep and goats (US$239 million), all of which are sold primarily to the UAE, China, Saudi Arabia, India and Italy.\n\nSudan (and South Sudan) exported about 132,000 barrels per day of crude oil in 2021 with the UAE accounting for 45% of these exports. Sudan is also the world\u2019s top exporter of gum arabic, a key ingredient for many food industries. The harvest of this product has been disrupted by the conflict.\n\nSudan\u2019s main imports are raw sugar, refined petroleum, wheat, packaged medicines and cars, mainly from China, UAE, Saudi Arabia, India and Egypt. The current conflict could derail this trade and create economic problems for Sudan and its trading partners.\n\nSudan is not a major export market for these countries but they should care about the instability in Khartoum for at least two reasons. First, the conflict could destabilise the region and negatively affect the efforts of these countries to expand their export trade. Second, Sudan is located on the Red Sea. Instability could interfere with trade flows through the Suez Canal, restraining these countries\u2019 ability to trade with the rest of the world.\n\nPort Sudan, which is about 169 nautical miles from Jeddah (Saudi Arabia), is an important travel point for thousands of Muslims from west and other parts of Africa who are embarking on the Hajj to Mecca through Jeddah Islamic Port. In addition, most Nigerian hajj air carriers transit through Sudanese airspace on their way to Mecca. Violent conflict in Sudan could force these carriers to seek alternative but more expensive and longer routes, a process that could prevent many Muslims from successfully performing this important religious ritual.\n\nIn addition, 90% of Sudan\u2019s external trade passes through Port Sudan. The port is also an important commercial sea gateway for neighbouring landlocked countries. Interruption of the port could worsen already acute shortages of key commodities, including especially food.\n\nPort Sudan also has a container port that handles trade to and from various parts of the world. It has been argued that Russia is seeking to build a military base at Port Sudan in order to grant its warships access to and influence over one of the world\u2019s busiest and most contested sea lanes \u2013 the Suez Canal.\n\nRipple effect\n\nA civil war in Sudan could spill into already violence-plagued neighbouring countries, such as Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Libya, Eritrea and Ethiopia.\n\nWere Sudan\u2019s neighbours to get involved on either side of the conflict, the region could become embroiled in the civil war largely because communities in the border areas share a common heritage.\n\nTwo countries stand to suffer the most if the conflict escalates: Egypt and South Sudan.\n\nSudan straddles the Nile River. Its main tributaries meet at Khartoum and then flow downstream to water-hungry Egypt. Fragility in Khartoum could affect Egypt\u2019s fresh water supply and hence economic and social development.\n\nInstability in Khartoum could also derail efforts to reach agreement on the filling and management of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. That could create problems, not just for Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, but also for the entire Nile basin.\n\nRead more: Ethiopia's dam dispute: five key reads about how it started and how it could end\n\nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is a hydro-electric project which Cairo sees as a threat to its use of the Nile. Since Ethiopia began constructing the dam in 2011, Egypt has relied on Khartoum\u2019s cooperation to fight perceived threats to its water security.\n\nCairo might see Sudan\u2019s security situation as a threat to reaching a mutually acceptable tripartite treaty for the filling and management of the dam. A peaceful, democratic Sudan, thus, is important to Egypt and other Nile Basin countries.\n\nNinety percent of South Sudan\u2019s economy is based on oil, which is exported through Sudan to Port Sudan. Conflict in Khartoum could seriously interfere with oil shipments and force economic collapse in South Sudan.\n\nRead more: South Sudan's oil and water give it bargaining power \u2013 but will it benefit the people?\n\nExternal ties\n\nOutside the African continent, three countries have significant interests in seeing Sudan return to peaceful coexistence: the Russian Federation, the US and the UAE.\n\nThe Russian Federation: Russia is interested primarily in gaining access to the country\u2019s enormous resources, which include gold, uranium, oil and its port facilities. Looking ahead, Russia also has much to lose. It has sought for some time to establish a military base at Port Sudan, which would host about 300 troops and give Russian warships access to and influence over the Suez Canal and the Red Sea.\n\nRussia\u2019s hope is that its foothold in Sudan will give it better access to other countries in North Africa and the Horn of Africa. A full-blown civil war would delay or derail that.\n\nThe United States: Some foreign governments, such as the US, have indicated that they are interested in helping Sudan establish democratic institutions and a governing process undergirded by the rule of law. Others may want to place themselves in a position to exploit the country and its resources. However, since it signed on to the Abraham Accords, Sudan has emerged as an important player in efforts by Washington to improve diplomatic relations between Israel and the Arab States.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE): The UAE has military and commercial assets in Eritrea, Somaliland, Somalia and the southern coast of Yemen. It stands to benefit from a peaceful Sudan. Under the administration of Omar al-Bashir \u2013 the military leader who ruled Sudan for three decades until he was overthrown during a 2019 popular uprising \u2013 Sudan was a beneficiary of billions of dollars in aid from the UAE. The UAE has also benefited from the relationship. For example, Sudan has become a major exporter of gold to the UAE.\n\nFinally, continued instability in Sudan could exacerbate the already serious humanitarian situation in many of Sudan\u2019s neighbours, such as Chad, which has received hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees."

        "title": "Pepe, Ripple and Dogecoin Crypto Analysis - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Latest news and prices from the crypto sector: today we analyse Pepe (PEPE), Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nIn particular, PEPE is attracting the attention of the entire market as it continues to post record-breaking numbers, to the point of being dubbed the next Doge Killer.\n\nShould Elon Musk\u2019s favourite dog feel threatened by the frog attack? We find out together in this article.\n\nThe latest news on Crypto Pepe (PEPE), Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\nLet\u2019s start our analysis of cryptos Pepe (PEPE), Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) by looking at the main news.\n\nAs far as Pepe is concerned, there is no major news that does not affect the price front, which will be discussed in the next section.\n\nThe only news worth mentioning is a series of on-chain transactions that the memecoin team has performed to safely move funds from the \u201cPepecexwallet.eth\u201d address to a more secure and tamper-proof multi-signature wallet.\n\nThe wallet currently holds 26.7 trillion PEPEs worth $56 million.\n\ntransfers to the multi-sig are complete. pic.twitter.com/k3KyeQ9NuA \u2014 Pepe (@pepecoineth) May 4, 2023\n\nOn the Ripple front, in addition to the classic promotional activities that the company carries out on social media to make its products and services known to the public, the main news concerns the publication of the quarterly report for the first quarter of 2023 for the XRP cryptocurrency.\n\nThe document covers sensitive topics such as the global regulation of crypto assets, the developments and improvements made to the open source XRP ledger blockchain, as well as some technical and economic-financial data related to the Ripple token.\n\nThe Q1 2023 XRP Markets Report is live\u2014detailing important events in crypto and the broader financial markets in Q1, global regulatory progress, a vibrant community building on the XRP Ledger, and the latest technical updates on the #XRPL. https://t.co/owULBusAMC \u2014 Ripple (@Ripple) April 27, 2023\n\nFinally, there is no news to report on Dogecoin, Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk\u2018s favourite crypto.\n\nAt most, we can mention this tweet published by the official Dogecoin account, which alludes to a rivalry between anti-innovation boomers who want to maintain their hegemony over the world and new technologies and robots that could potentially replace those same boomers and human labour, but not in terms of the ability to put on trousers!\n\nThe irony continues in the comments section of the tweet, where some users claim that robots do not wear trousers.\n\nJust because the old man lost his mule, does not mean it's a bad thing. Gravy is a dish often served warm. Robots may be good at math, but a human will beat them at putting on pants every single time. \u2014 Dogecoin (@dogecoin) April 24, 2023\n\nMarket analysis for the crypto Pepe (PEPE), Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\nMoving on to price analysis, which is much more interesting today than the news front, let\u2019s take a look at how the cryptos Pepe (PEPE), Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are performing graphically.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the price of PEPE, a crypto that has literally \u201cgone to the moon\u201d in recent days, and just today hit a new all-time high on Uniswap at 3am Italian time, at a price of $0.00000233 per token.\n\nAt the time of writing, the crypto depicting the famous \u2018Pepe the Frog\u2019 meme is once again attacking the highs and currently stands at $0.00000215.\n\nThe market capitalization has reached the figure of $895 million, a crazy figure considering that PEPE was only born on the 15th of April and is a cryptocurrency with no purpose and no intrinsic value.\n\nThis last detail is not the result of a personal opinion, but was announced by the cryptocurrency team itself, which recommends on its website not to expect any financial return from buying PEPE.\n\nThis makes one quite smile if one takes a look at PEPE\u2019s graph.\n\n4h chart of the price of Pepe (PEPE/USDC)\n\nTurning to a token with more sobriety and less euphoria, we can look at the chart of XRP and see that the price is perfectly balanced between a bullish and a bearish scenario in the short term.\n\nThe crypto currently has a value of $0.459 per token and a market capitalisation of $23.8 billion.\n\nAfter forming a \u201cbart\u201d\u2019 pattern, named after the famous character from The Simpsons cartoon, prices converged below the fast 10-period average (daily time frame) and simultaneously above the slower 60-period average.\n\nThe situation is therefore stalled: even when looking at the situation over longer periods, there are no technical indicators that can be used to predict the future price of XRP.\n\nThe best solution in these cases is to wait for a break on either side and only open positions after confirmation.\n\nDaily chart of Ripple (XRP/USDT)\n\nFinally, looking at DOGE, which has been PEPE\u2019s nemesis for a few days now, the situation seems to be bearish, with low volumes and bearish crosses of the 10 and 60 period averages on the daily timeframe.\n\nThe crypto\u2019s current value is $0.078 per token, with a market cap of $10.9 billion.\n\nIt is likely that most DOGE traders have temporarily moved on to other markets such as PEPE or the BRC-20 token market on the Bitcoin blockchain, both of which are experiencing hype.\n\nIt may be some time before we see extreme price spikes in DOGE again.\n\nDaily price chart of Dogecoin (DOGE/USDT)\n\nNew all-time high for PEPE: could it be the next Doge Killer?\n\nPEPE\u2019s exponential growth is prompting many people on Twitter to name the anthropomorphic frog-based crypto meme as the next Doge Killer to replace it.\n\nIt is difficult to make such predictions given the volatility of the crypto market and the tendency of memecoins to defy every existing rule of the financial markets.What we can do is refer to objective data: in order to reach the same market capitalization as DOGE, the crypto PEPE would have to make an additional X12 from its current price, according to data from \u201cMarketcapof\u201c.\n\nIt is not impossible to believe that this will happen, but it is unlikely at the moment, as PEPE has already been pumped up quite a bit since its recent arrival on the market.\n\nPerhaps PEPE the frog could overtake DOGE the dog in the near future, probably in a few months/years, with the more likely scenario being traders taking advantage of the exponential rise in the value of crypto.\n\nRemember that markets are a zero-sum game: if someone makes a lot of money, someone else loses just as much.\n\nBe very cautious about positioning yourself on such extended charts, even if there is still the possibility of further gains.\n\nThe prudent thing to do in such cases is to relax, do some maths on the risk management side and calculate the risk/reward ratio of the trade you are thinking of executing.\n\nOn the more technical on-chain side, it is interesting to note this tweet from \u201clookonchain\u201d showing how a trader who made a stellar profit on SHIB in 2021 is moving part of his main holding (SHIB to be precise) into PEPE.\n\nFollowing the movements of the whales can be a trump card for predicting the next short-term movements of cryptocurrencies, as long as this data is correlated with other variables that are part of the study of technical and fundamental analysis."
