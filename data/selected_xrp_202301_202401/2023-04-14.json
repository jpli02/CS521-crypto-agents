        "content": "The executives at Ripple (XRP) have expressed confidence in the recent past that they can win the case as XRP does not pass the \"Howey Test\" which the regulator uses to define whether an asset is a security. Another aspect used by the defense was comments from a previous SEC director which claimed Bitcoin and Ethereum do not classify as securities because they are decentralized. Despite their hopes of winning, the ongoing suit has hampered productivity in the project and XRP investors have struggled."

        "title": "Ripple CTO Dismisses Claims that XRP Ledger Handles 1,500 Transactions Per Sec - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "The claim was part of many widely held beliefs about the XRP Ledger and XRP, later debunked by the CTO.\n\nDavid Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Ripple, recently dismissed claims that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) currently handles up to 1,500 transactions per second (TPS). Schwartz\u2019s remarks were made in reply to queries raised by a member of the XRP community.\n\nSchwartz recently took to Twitter to dispel ten different beliefs about XRP and the XRP Ledger that are widely held by the community but are, in fact, false. One such claim is that XRPL processes up to 1,500 transactions per second. An anonymous community member had called attention to these claims.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFor the uninitiated, transaction per second (TPS) is a metric that measures the number of transactions processed by a blockchain network per second. The TPS of a blockchain network depends on several factors, including the network\u2019s consensus algorithm, block size, network latency, and transaction complexity.\n\nAccording to Schwartz, they have never witnessed up to 1,500 TPS on the live XRP Ledger since it launched in 2012. However, he acknowledged that the blockchain\u2019s current configuration could support up to 300 to 500 transactions per second on a live network. For context, Bitcoin processes between 3 and 7 transactions per second.\n\n\u2026\n\n3. We've never seen 1,500 TPS on the live XRPL. I suspect it could, as currently configured, probably sustain about 300-500.\n\n4. While someone could create a basket containing XRP, the only current reason to do so I can think of is as for cryptocurrency index exposure. \u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 13, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOne of the XRP community members highlighted an authoritative source on the official Ripple website as the origin of the widely-held claim. Specifically, the page dedicated to XRP on the Ripple website explicitly states that XRPL \u201cconsistently handles 1,500 transactions per second, 24\u00d77.\u201d\n\nIn response, Schwartz clarified that the statement XRPL consistently handles 1,500 TPS 24/7 is not true, as the current operation of the XRPL on the live network is below the 1500 TPS mark.\n\nHe acknowledged that the statement was poorly worded and has reported to the appropriate department to have it corrected.\n\n\u201cThat is poorly worded, I agree\u2026\u201d\n\nThat is poorly worded, I agree. It's trying to say that the XRPL software/technology can consistently handle 15,000 TPS 24\u00d77. I agree that the wording suggests that the live network is actually doing that (something nobody would want). \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 14, 2023\n\nSchwartz Debunks Other Claims\n\nDavid Schwartz also tackled nine other misconceptions regarding the XRPL that had been recently refuted. Among them, he explained that the XRP Ledger relies on the internet and cannot function offline. He further confirmed that, at present, no Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are issued on XRPL.\n\nSure.\n\n1. XRPL certainly needs the Internet for now and the foreseeable future.\n\n2. No CBDCs on XRPL right now. \u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 13, 2023\n\nFurthermore, Schwartz noted that RippleNet, Ripple\u2019s global payment network consisting of banks and financial institutions, does not use liquidity from the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution."

        "title": "Missouri House Republicans want to defund libraries. Here\u2019s why - PBS NewsHour",
        "content": "ST. LOUIS\u2013 Missouri\u2019s Republican-led House voted to cut all funding for libraries in its version of the state\u2019s annual budget, an unprecedented move that has angered librarians and patrons across the state who rely on the facilities for everything from books to educational programming and internet access.\n\nThe proposal is not yet final; it now sits before the state Senate\u2019s appropriations committee along with the rest of the annual $45.6 billion budget, and Republican chair Sen. Lincoln Hough said it would be his intention to restore library funding.\n\nBut for those who manage or use the state\u2019s 160 library districts, especially in rural areas where services are not as robust, the threat feels real, librarians and patrons told the PBS NewsHour.\n\n\u201cThe majority of Missouri libraries are small libraries, and for smaller communities that rely on this funding to serve their communities, to provide summer reading programing, to provide new books, new materials, books, and to pay their staff, this will have an absolutely devastating effect,\u201d said Judy Garrett, who has served as a librarian at the Gentry County Public Library for 27 years.\n\nGentry County, located 90 miles north of Kansas City, is home to a little over 6,000 people, many of whom, like residents in other rural parts of the state, rely heavily on their libraries for internet access, Garrett said.\n\nIn Missouri, 20 percent of the population \u2013 more than 1.26 million people \u2014 do not have high-speed internet access. Nearly 34 percent of Missouri\u2019s population live in rural parts of the state, where this kind of access can be harder to come by. Libraries provide a lifeline to this service, among others.\n\nREAD MORE:House Republicans pass \u2018parents\u2019 rights\u2019 bill in fight over schools\n\nBeyond internet, libraries have historically provided analog services that existed long before fiber optics, such as passport services, free concerts and assistance with voter registration. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, some branches expanded their offerings to include distribution of masks and test kits, and vaccine clinics.\n\nJon Karlen, a resident of St. Charles County, whose more than 400,000 residents are represented by Republican legislators, told the NewsHour that book bans and library funding cuts in the state feels like an effort to control distribution of information, which, he said, would hurt the state\u2019s most vulnerable residents in the end.\n\n\u201cSome people would say, \u2018well, if kids want to learn about that, it\u2019s all there. They just have to go home and Google it.\u2019 But as far into the Internet era as we are, not everybody in Missouri has that opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nMissouri Rep. Cody Smith, the House budget committee chair who proposed eliminating library funding, pointed to a recent lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union over a state law banning sexually explicit material from schools as justification for the cuts. Nearly 300 books have been removed from school libraries under the law, according to EducationWeek. The ACLU is suing the state alongside the Missouri Association of School Librarians and the Missouri Library Association.\n\nDuring a committee hearing back in March, Smith, who was recognized by the Missouri Library Association in 2019 for his \u201ccontribution to the welfare of Missouri\u2019s libraries,\u201d restated his position.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should subsidize the attempts to overturn laws that we also created,\u201d Smith said in a budget meeting.\n\nIn a statement, the ACLU said the lawsuit, filed in February, is not funded by state-funded library dollars.\n\nSmith did not respond to a request from the PBS NewsHour for comment.\n\nREAD MORE: Experts say attacks on free speech are rising across the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe house budget committee\u2019s choice to retaliate against two private, volunteer-led organizations by punishing the patrons of Missouri\u2019s public libraries is abhorrent. As with every case when the ACLU represents someone, we are not charging our clients to challenge the unconstitutional book ban the legislature passed last year,\u201d the statement read.\n\nOpponents of the proposed cuts argue the move is unconstitutional, pointing to a 1945 statute in the Missouri constitution declaring \u201cthe establishment and development of free public libraries and to accept the obligation of their support by the state and its subdivisions and municipalities in such manner as may be provided by law.\u201d\n\nRep. Peter Merideth, a ranking Democrat on the state house\u2019s budget committee who tried along with other party members to reinstate the funding, called the move to strip the funds \u201chorrific, and borderline fascist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate using that word,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it sounds like a dystopian novel where a government issues a book ban, librarians are upset about it and try to exercise their rights and the government then de-funded public libraries, which is like the primary source of free information in our state.\u201d\n\nKarlen said it is issues like these, among others, that show the state\u2019s lawmakers don\u2019t make decisions that align with what voters want.\n\n\u201cThe electorate is paying attention and sometimes it takes a few cycles to catch up, but they\u2019re taking away vital and important services to the people that send them into power,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lincoln Hough, who chairs the Senate Committee on appropriations, called the house\u2019s decision \u201cshortsighted.\u201d\n\n\u201cLibraries provide access to reading materials for people that maybe don\u2019t have the means to order every book that they want,\u201d Hough said. \u201cI know our community in Springfield, we depend on those libraries and those resources \u2013 and not just for reading material, but for Internet access for folks sometimes that are a little less socioeconomically disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nOtter Bowman, president of the Missouri Library Association ,said beyond basic services, \u201cthe physical buildings become either a cool space or a warm space for our unhoused population, depending on the weather.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:As LGBTQ book challenges rise, some Louisiana librarians are scared to go to work\n\nTamara King, a parent and resident of St. Charles County, told the NewsHour it feels like the state\u2019s residents should still be concerned even if the budget is not yet final.\n\n\u201cYou start by taking away small things, right? And then you do that, you gain your support and then you go for the jugular, right? So that\u2019s what they did. They took away everything. Now, where are these kids supposed to go and learn and have those activities that involve books?\u201d King said. \u201cBooks create imagination.\u201d\n\nLike many lawmakers, Hough said he\u2019s been fielding calls from constituents since the decision was made.\n\nRegina Cooper is the Executive Director of the Springfield-Greene County Library District, which sits in Hough\u2019s district and has worked in library systems for more than 40 years.\n\nWhen she heard reduced funding could be in her library\u2019s future, she said she was concerned not only for her own library, but also for others dealing with even smaller budgets. .\n\n\u201cMoney is tight and we have a lot of needs. And as you know, inflation continues to be a problem,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cEvery year our expenses go up.\u201d\n\nThe Springfield-Greene County Library District serves nearly 300,000 people in the surrounding area. Though the cuts are still being discussed, Cooper believes the decisions that state lawmakers have made make their message clear.\n\n\u201cI think it makes [community members] feel like that who they elected, don\u2019t really care about what their needs are because it\u2019s something they all know and use every day. To suddenly have the legislators say, \u2018no, we\u2019re not going to provide any more money for you,\u2019 that\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d she told the NewsHour.\n\nCooper said the move was a surprise to most librarians seeing that some politicians utilize library services themselves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it would feel that way to me, even if I weren\u2019t the librarian[and] just a patron that [knows] this is a really important thing for me and my family. Why are you not supporting this?\u201d she said.\n\nThe importance of libraries was made especially clear during the pandemic, Garrett said, when librarians had to get creative about how to fill needs that were at times more acute than ever.\n\n\u201cDuring the pandemic when we weren\u2019t able to be open, our parking lot was full of cars because we expanded our wireless outreach beyond our walls so that people could get online to do homeschooling or\u2026.. they had to use their computers to access their schoolwork,\u201d Garrett said.\n\nBowman worries most about libraries like Garrett\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThere are so many small libraries that are just barely getting by on a shoestring the way it is,\u201d Bowman said\n\nDespite reassurance from lawmakers, Bowman said the future feels uncertain.\n\n\u201cNationally, this is such a thing right now. There\u2019s an attack on public schools and there\u2019s an attack on public libraries and I would just really hate for us to continue to stay in the news for all the wrong reasons,\u201d she said."
