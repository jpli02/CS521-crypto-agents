        "content": "Ripple seems determined to push the legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into a decisive victory in its favor.\n\nAs such, the company recently hired a renowned lawyer who could help in that mission.\n\nRipple Welcomes Rahul Mukhi\n\nJames K. Filan \u2013 a defense lawyer and formal federal prosecutor \u2013 took it to X (Twitter) to reveal that Rahul Mukhi will represent Ripple and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse in its ongoing lawsuit with America\u2019s securities regulator.\n\nMukhi has a rich experience in the field, having served as Assistant United States Attorney between 2010 and 2016. He later became a counsel and partner at the international law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.\n\nOver the past decade, Mukhi has led significant cases involving financial and tax fraud, public corruption, cybercrime, money laundering, and organized crime.\n\nA Brief Recap of Ripple v. the SEC Battle\n\nThe legal dispute started in December 2020 when the SEC filed a lawsuit, accusing Ripple of trading billions of dollars worth of XRP as a security without registering with the Commission.\n\nThe heated battle passed through numerous stages in the following years as both entities fired shots at each other. However, Ripple seems to have a serious advantage since it secured a vital but yet partial win in July when a US court ruled that most of its XRP sales did not constitute an offer of investment contracts.\n\nThe SEC formally appealed the decision at the beginning of September, hinting that the fight is far from over. Some crypto analysts have argued that Ripple will manage to emerge victorious as the watchdog\u2019s request might hit a dead end. One such example is the popular trader using the X handle KALEO."

        "content": "Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies \u2013 Ripple (XRP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) \u2013 have achieved a major milestone as the British banking behemoth HSBC allowed their usage for specific payments.\n\nIn the following lines, we will explain in detail in which cases customers can take advantage of the latest offering.\n\nXRP, SHIB, DOGE, and More\n\nThe biggest banking institution in the United Kingdom \u2013 HSBC \u2013 collaborated with the blockchain payment system \u2013 FCF Pay \u2013 to allow eligible clients to pay their mortgage bills and loans in various cryptocurrencies.\n\nAmong the supported assets are the most popular memecoins \u2013 Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) \u2013 as well as Ripple\u2019s native token XRP. Interestingly, the announcement had little-to-no effect on the price of the aforementioned coins.\n\nIn fact, most digital assets have recently either consolidated to certain levels or have slightly decreased their valuation. XRP and SHIB are down almost 2% for the past week, whereas DOGE has slumped by over 3% (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nHSBC\u2019s Previous Crypto Forays\n\nThe financial institution made some of its first steps in the cryptocurrency industry in December 2021 when it partnered with Wells Fargo to use a blockchain platform to settle Forex transactions.\n\nA few months later, it teamed up with The Sandbox to become the first global bank to enter the Metaverse. According to the plan, HSBC vowed to purchase virtual real estate in the form of LAND. Thus, it could use it to connect and engage with sports, esports, and gaming enthusiasts.\n\nDespite those pro-crypto moves, HSBC has been rather critical of the industry in the past. In the spring of 2021, CEO Noel Quinn \u2013 said the bank has no intention to adopt Bitcoin and offer it as an investment option to customers:\n\n\u201cGiven the volatility, we are not into Bitcoin as an asset class, if our clients want to be there, then of course they are, but we are not promoting it as an asset class within our wealth management business.\u201d"

        "title": "David Schwartz on Trust and Security in the XRP Ledger - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "On 26 September 2023, David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, elucidated the inner workings of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), specifically discussing the roles of nodes and validators.\n\nThe XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized cryptographic ledger that is powered by a network of peer-to-peer servers. It is the underlying technology that supports the digital asset XRP, which was created to facilitate quick, low-cost cross-border payments. Unlike traditional financial systems, the XRP Ledger provides a more efficient and scalable way to transfer value. It operates on a consensus algorithm to validate transactions, ensuring that the network remains secure and functional without relying on a central authority.\n\nThe XRP Ledger is open-source and permissionless, meaning that anyone can participate in the network. It also offers various features like a decentralized exchange, smart contracts, and the ability to issue new tokens. These functionalities make it a versatile platform that can be used for a wide range of financial applications beyond just transferring XRP.\n\nSchwartz stated that the only way to interact with the XRPL is through a node. If you\u2019re not running your own node, he pointed out that you would be relying on someone else\u2019s node, thereby placing some level of trust in that third party.\n\nSchwartz emphasized that all key information about the XRPL is publicly accessible. This includes the state of the ledger, all transactions, and the rules governing those transactions. According to Schwartz, if a node is functioning as it should, it will automatically be aware of these three crucial aspects.\n\nContrary to some popular beliefs, Schwartz clarified that nodes in the XRPL don\u2019t require external validators to determine the validity of transactions. He explained that nodes are inherently programmed to recognize which transactions are valid and what actions those transactions will perform. Schwartz affirmed that all honest nodes would naturally reach a consensus on these matters, as the system\u2019s rules dictate them.\n\nHowever, Schwartz also highlighted validators\u2019 indispensable role, particularly in resolving the double spend problem. In situations where two equally valid but conflicting transactions are submitted to the network, Schwartz stated that validators are essential for deciding which transaction to approve and which to reject. He emphasized that the primary role of validators is to maintain consensus among all honest nodes regarding asset ownership, especially when conflicting transactions arise.\n\nFor added convenience, Schwartz mentioned that validators also assist in coordinating the activation of network features. However, he explicitly stated that this is not a governance function. According to Schwartz, validators do not possess the authority to compel nodes to accept features they are unwilling to implement."

        "content": "The Ripple CTO addressed the talks about the preferential treatment Ripple had toward XRP holders.\n\nWeighted sentiment remained negative while social dominance jumped.\n\nThe heat Ripple [XRP] has been facing has not just been limited to its issue with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although unpopular like the former, some market players have repeatedly accused XRP of being a centralized entity.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 XRPs worth today?\n\nRipple keeps explaining, no evidence\n\nThe discussion arose again on 24 September, as a certain \u201cWolf of Golden Street\u201d asked Ripple\u2019s CTO David Schwartz about the centralized XRP claims. To buttress his point, the pseudonymous X (formerly Twitter) user, noted that Bitcoin [BTC] maximalist Max Keiser, had been at the forefront of the accusation.\n\nSchwartz, in his response, mentioned that the claims were random assertions with no evidence to back them up. He said,\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to find a coherent claim to answer. Any particular tweet that makes an actual claim? They all just seem like random assertions mixed with insults.\u201d\n\nHowever, Wolf of Golden Street was not one to give up. He went ahead and asked Schwartz to clarify the claims that Ripple was only committed to empowering the top 1% XRP holders instead of the entire cohort.\n\nSchwartz responded, saying that the 1% claim had no basis, and ownership of XRP could be transparent and could be tracked on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). While the CTO admitted that XRP had a centralized design, he mentioned other reasons while referencing Bitcoin, that the token itself is not centralized.\n\n1.Does XRP really empower the top 1% who is controlling the main XRP system. I\u2019m not sure I understand this claim. The top 1% of what exactly? XRP empowers anyone who want to use the ledger to track the ownership and exchange of assets. What kind of control is he talking about\u2026 \u2014 David \u201cJoelKatz\u201d Schwartz (@JoelKatz) September 24, 2023\n\nEyes are back on XRP\n\nA look at on-chain data from the XRPL showed that this lack of clarity may have affected the XRP sentiment. At press time, the weighted sentiment was -0.061. Weighted sentiment shows the unique social volume attributed to a cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen the metric is positive, it means that there are more positive comments than negative ones in relation to the asset. Therefore, XRP\u2019s weighted sentiment being negative suggested that XRP was dealing with more negative comments than positive ones.\n\nAs per the social dominance, XRP seemed to be getting back the attention it had lost. Previously, XRP\u2019s social dominance was down to 1.18%. However, the metric had risen to 1.80% as of this writing.\n\nThe rise in social dominance suggested that there was more discussion relating to the asset than there was before. Compared to other cryptocurrencies in the top 100, XRP looks to have grabbed a good share of the assets being talked about often.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s XRP\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nHowever, the circulation in the last 24 hours had fallen to 153.48 million. This meant that fewer XRP tokens had been used within the period. On the positive side, the token may not experience any notable selling pressure."

        "content": "Amid growing interest in the XRP Ledger (XRPL), Ripple CTO David Schwartz clarifies validators\u2019 roles on the decentralized network.\n\nRipple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has presented a clear overview of the role validators play on XRP Ledger. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a blockchain network that uses XRP as a native currency and supports the development of decentralized applications.\n\nLaunched in June 2012, XRPL operates a Federated Consensus model, which requires validators to agree on ordering transactions on the network.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, similar to most blockchains, users can also run a node to send transactions and verify the state of the ledger. There are currently 118 validators on the network, with 681 nodes, according to XRPL.org.\n\nDavid Schwartz\u2019s latest expose breaks down the relationship between nodes and validators on XRPL. It mentioned, among other things, that an individual node does not need validators to \u201ctell it what transactions are valid.\u201d\n\nOnce again, what validators do for XRPL: There is one, and only one, way to interact with XRPL, and that's through a node. If you interact with XRPL and don't run a node, someone else is running a node for you that you are interacting with and you are, at least to some extent,\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) September 26, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRelationship between nodes and validators on XRPL\n\nAccording to the Ripple CTO, the only problem nodes cannot solve on XRPL is the double-spend dilemma which is handled by validators on the network. The double spend problem, which was originally solved by Bitcoin\u2019s technology but advanced by more recent systems such as XRPL, provides a way to detect fraudulent transactions on the network.\n\nCommenting on how someone can try to cheat the network, David Schwartz wrote, \u201cSomeone can submit two equally-good, but conflicting, transactions to the network, and you need some way to agree on which one of them to permit and which to reject.\u201d\n\nXRPL validators follow carefully outlined system rules to distinguish such transactions, and once done, honest nodes will stay in agreement. They can thus distinguish which address holds what assets and avoid getting confused by conflicting transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, validators on XRPL play additional roles, including activating network features by upgrading to the latest XRPL software.\n\nDavid Schwartz clarified that validators \u201ccannot force nodes\u201d to adopt features they do not want. This factor means that nodes on XRPL also contribute to the network\u2019s decentralization since they reserve the right to choose whether or not they would accept some implementations approved by validators.\n\nXRPL Sees Growing Interest\n\nThe work of nodes and validators under the hood helps power XRPL and enable developers to build user-facing applications. In recent times, XRPL has seen an influx of user interest, especially with the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps on the network.\n\nThis month alone, two new DEXes have launched on the XRPL testnet, seeking to allow users the option to exchange XRPL-based assets. These exchanges seek to tap into a new upgrade that will enable native automated market-making (AMM) on XRPL for the first time."
