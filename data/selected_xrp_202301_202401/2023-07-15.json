        "content": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse does not see Judge Torres\u2019 ruling as a split victory, as he believes the SEC lost on the essential aspects of the lawsuit.\n\nThe crypto community has been analyzing Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 final SEC v. Ripple case verdict.\n\nJudge Torres\u2019 Decision\n\nRecall that the judge issued her decision earlier this week. While ruling that XRP is not a security, Judge Torres also ordered that XRP sales by Ripple execs and other XRP distribution to developers, employees, and charities are not securities.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, the judge ruled that Ripple\u2019s direct past sales to institutional investors constitute securities\u2014these transactions amount to $728.9 million, lower than the SEC requested in its original complaint.\n\nFox Business Journalist Asks How Ripple Will Pay Fine\n\nFollowing the ruling, many crypto enthusiasts have suggested that Ripple will be required to pay a fine of $728.9 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nInterestingly, prominent Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino also weighed in on the penalty aspect of the lawsuit. In a tweet yesterday, Gasparino questioned how Ripple intends to pay the fine to the SEC.\n\nHe asked whether Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse would be the one to pay the SEC directly from his pocket. Furthermore, Gasparino also questioned whether Ripple has the financial capability to pay the $728.9 million to the regulatory agency.\n\nBREAKING: Will @bgarlinghouse have to reach into his own pocket to pay @SECGov ruling the initial institutional sales of #XRP a security? Does @Ripple have enough money on its balance sheet to settle a possible @SECGov fine? We are waiting for answers from @Ripple stay tuned \u2014 Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) July 14, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRipple CEO Reacts\n\nGasparino\u2019s questions prompted reactions from Garlinghouse. In response, Garlinghouse said the court would decide the issue of potential penalties, not the SEC.\n\nPer Garlinghouse, the SEC\u2019s attempt to paint Judge Torres\u2019 ruling as a \u201csplit victory\u201d is pathetic, adding that the agency lost every important aspect of the lawsuit.\n\nCharlie, happy to come into the studio any time to discuss the facts. Any attempt by the SEC to paint this as some sort of split victory is pathetic. They lost on everything that matters (as many lawyers have noted, not just Ripple\u2019s). \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 15, 2023\n\nFurthermore, Garlinghouse pointed out that the lawsuit was never about fines but the company\u2019s quest to establish the non-security status of XRP.\n\nWith Judge Torres ruling that XRP is a non-security, Garlinghouse asserted that Ripple won while the SEC lost the case.\n\n\u201cYou very well know this case was never about fines or penalties; it was about establishing the non-security status of XRP. We won. They lost.\u201d\n\nTo your question here about potential penalties \u2013 that\u2019s up to the Court to decide, not the SEC. You very well know this case was never about fines or penalties, it was about establishing the non-security status of XRP. We won. They lost. \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 15, 2023\n\nNotably, Garlinghouse said he is open to discussing the facts of the ruling with Gasparino.\n\nSEC Is Pleased With Court\u2019s Ruling\n\nIt can be recalled that the SEC also claimed to be the biggest winner of the lawsuit. In a statement sent to Fox Business, the SEC said it is pleased the court ruled that Ripple violated federal securities law in certain circumstances via its XRP offering.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s \u201cpathetic\u201d statement, as described by Ripple\u2019s CLO Stuart Alderoty, has made many believe Judge Torres\u2019 ruling is a split victory."

On Thursday Ripple Labs got a landmark ruling from a federal judge who said some of the company's XRP token sales were not subject to securities laws.US District Judge Analisa Torres in New York found some digital token sales by Ripple did not violate the law as alleged by US Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC sued Ripple for conducting an unregistered offering of $1.3 billion in XRP between 2013 and 2020.Torres ruled that Ripple's sales on public exchanges to retail investors were not offers of securities under the law because purchasers did not have a reasonable expectation of profit tied to Ripple's efforts.Those sales were \"blind bid/ask transactions,\" she said, in which buyers \"could not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple, or any other seller of XRP.\"It was the biggest win for a cryptocurrency company in a case brought by the SEC. The regulator got a partial victory because Torres also ruled that Ripple violated securities laws when it sold XRP directly to sophisticated investors such as hedge funds.The regulator has brought more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto companies, claiming digital assets are securities.The biggest case was brought this year. The SEC said Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency platform, allowed users to trade at least 13 crypto assets that should have been registered as securities, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon. Coinbase denied the allegation.Industry players have insisted that most cryptocurrencies - which operate on a database shared across a network of computers, known as a blockchain - do not fit the US legal definition of securities. They say the SEC has been vague and inconsistent and have called for new regulations or laws.To SEC's contends crypto assets are securities, citing a US Supreme Court case from 1946 dealing with investors in Florida orange groves owned by the W. J. Howey Co.The court ruled that \"an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others,\" is a kind of security called an investment contract.The SEC had jurisdiction to seek to prevent Howey from selling to out-of-state investors fractional land interests with a contract to provide profit from the harvest, the court said.Securities, unlike assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks.Many of the SEC's crypto-related cases have ended in settlements, with companies paying fines and agreeing to follow US law or exiting the US market.Before the Ripple decision, judges in the few cases decided in court agreed with the SEC that specific crypto assets were securities.Those rulings said developers' statements tying the value of their digital assets to efforts to grow or maintain the associated blockchain systems showed investor profits depended on the \"efforts of others.\"Courts have also decided that investors in those assets participated in a \"common enterprise\" because the funds they spent were pooled by the token issuer and used to develop relevant systems.Bitcoin is not considered a security because its anonymous and open-source origins mean investor profits are not dependent on the efforts of developers or managers, said Carol Goforth, a law professor at the University of Arkansas.Some blockchain projects have tried to fund their operations in two stages, by offering securities under SEC regulations and later giving or selling those investors cryptocurrency after building a functional blockchain.Goforth said the developers hoped that approach would remove the \"common enterprise\" element, but she added the SEC has never clarified what it would take to convert a security to a non-security."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ripple (XRP) While It's Still Below $1? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The courtroom dust has settled, and Ripple's on a roll -- but should you jump on the bandwagon right now?\n\nThe crypto market experienced an avalanche this week, as the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) long-running lawsuit against Ripple (XRP 0.21%) finally reached an end. Ripple's XRP token (commonly known by the Ripple moniker) soared on the news of a legal victory as U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres issued a ruling firmly in Ripple's favor.\n\nRipple skyrocketed as much as 76% higher in four hours before backing down from the absolute peak. As of this writing near the stock market's closing bell on Friday, July 14, Ripple has tripled in a year and trades at $0.68 per token.\n\nDid the international payment processing expert burn all of its pent-up market interest with Thursday's legal ruling, or should you consider buying a few of these tokens while they remain valued below $1?\n\nHow did the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple Labs work out?\n\nI won't dive too deep into Ripple's business model today. Suffice it to say that the blockchain network and its XRP token focus on providing international payment processing at a large scale, with minimal transaction costs, and blink-and-you-missed-it settlement times.\n\nLet's focus on how the courtroom tussle with the SEC worked out instead, and what it means for Ripple investors going forward.\n\nAfter years of legal wrangling followed by many moons of intense deliberation, Judge Torres ruled that Ripple's operations didn't satisfy the Howey Test and therefore isn't subject to the rules and regulations that apply to a proper security. The SEC, which manages the trading, taxation, and ownership of securities, doesn't have the standing to impose its rules on Ripple.\n\nIt wasn't a complete victory, as the honorable judge also ruled that Ripple mismanaged the sale of XRP tokens to institutional investors before making them available to the public. But most crypto investors just wanted to see whether the SEC has any power over this market, and Judge Torres said that it doesn't.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe case isn't a closed book yet. The SEC will most likely file appeals against three of Judge Torres' four summary judgments, while Ripple Labs appeals the last one. Precedent-setting lawsuits like this one can end up in the U.S. Supreme Court many years later.\n\nBut the judgments removed the immediate threat of the SEC filing lawsuits against cryptocurrency traders and exchanges for the alleged crime of trading unregistered securities. American crypto exchanges that ended their support for trading XRP tokens in 2021 have opened up the floodgates again. Robinhood Markets (HOOD -3.44%) is still thinking about it but Binance US and Coinbase Global (COIN -5.03%) flipped the switch on Friday.\n\nMind you, investors abroad have been able to work with the XRP crypto throughout the lawsuit process, which started in December 2020. Still, the return of interested owners, traders, speculators, and long-term investors in the world's largest financial market must be seen as a big plus for Ripple's trading liquidity and long-term pricing prospects. Once the immediate furor fades out, Ripple's trading volumes should stay wider and deeper than the modest trickle that started in 2021 and ended this week.\n\nNavigating the clearer crypto waters\n\nIn light of these events, Ripple certainly presents an appealing investment opportunity, particularly with its value still below the $1 mark. With the recent court ruling lifting the specter of the SEC, the reopening of American crypto exchanges for XRP trading, and its consistent demand in international markets, Ripple's price outlook seems promising.\n\nHowever, as with any investment decision, it's crucial to take a balanced approach. While Ripple could be a viable addition to a diversified crypto portfolio, it's not necessarily the best crypto investment in this market. Stalwarts like Bitcoin (BTC -0.03%) and Ethereum (ETH -0.58%) still offer robust value and market stability. On the emerging end, Polkadot (DOT -0.85%) offers a direct bet on Web3, the decentralized internet. This trio of convincing crypto projects also benefit from Ripple's courtroom success, as the SEC had its hand slapped away from direct regulation of the digital assets market.\n\nWith or without this week's Ripple-friendly legal ruling, I still prefer these three crypto names. They are the cornerstone building blocks of the digital financial system that is taking shape right in front of us.\n\nSo it might be tempting to get caught up in the current Ripple hype, but you should still proceed with caution. Don't make the mistake of putting all your eggs in the XRP basket, but you could consider testing the waters while it's still under $1. There is nothing magical about that particular price point, apart from the strong impact a round number can have on investors' mass psychology."

        "content": "Many believe blockchains and crypto are a groundbreaking technology that enable creativity and entrepreneurship, and some regard these tools as just another internet fad.\n\nRegardless of where you stand, it\u2019s indisputable that the consumers and entrepreneurs alike in the burgeoning crypto and web3 sector face tremendous regulatory uncertainty, which holds the legitimate industry back and allows bad actors to flourish.\n\nThis tension was on full display as a federal district court just issued a much-anticipated summary judgment in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple Labs and two of its founders.\n\nThe ruling deems Ripple\u2019s direct sales of their digital asset XRP to institutional investors to be securities offerings\u2014which is in line with previous cases applying securities laws to initial coin offerings (ICOs) that dominated the industry in its early years. But in a blow to the SEC, the ruling did not extend the application of securities laws to Ripple\u2019s\u2014and its founders\u2019\u2014sales of XRP to individuals via certain digital asset exchange platforms.\n\nWhile this is a potentially significant win for crypto, and a rebuff to the SEC\u2019s ongoing war against it, the ruling results in a confusing set of outcomes which highlights the long standing uncertainty plaguing an industry clamoring for stability.\n\nWhat are entrepreneurs to make of the decision? On the one hand, the ruling is not the definitive word on the issue and may be appealed. This means entrepreneurs may choose to continue current industry practices, where digital asset issuers mostly rely on the SEC\u2019s helpful, but incomplete, decentralization framework from 2019\u2014a process that mitigates many of the risks digital assets pose to consumers. But even some members of the SEC have tried to distance themselves from that framework and it has proven to not be sufficiently clear or robust enough to be effective.\n\nOn the other hand, the ruling opens an entirely different pathway for digital asset issuers, as it establishes that digital assets sales on exchange platforms are not governed by securities laws. But the ruling is also directly at odds with the SEC\u2019s very recent actions against several major digital asset exchanges, including Coinbase.\n\nUltimately, what the Ripple ruling makes obvious is that the rules are anything but clear. And without clear rules, the SEC\u2019s current regulation-by-enforcement posture toward crypto is hurting, not helping American innovation.\n\nThis uncertainty has already long acted as a drag on the pace of innovation and a feeding ground for bad actors. Responsible actors have been subject to dubious U.S. regulatory enforcement actions, while ill-intentioned firms launch products that flagrantly violate long standing rules \u2013 often beyond the reach of U.S. authorities until it is too late.\n\nUnfortunately, this is likely to get worse before it gets better. Unless Congress acts quickly.\n\nThere are significant challenges to applying 80-year old precedents to novel technologies consistently. The unique advantages and risks of blockchain and crypto demand a new regulatory approach. Legitimate innovators and consumers of new products need clear rules of the road to build products with utility that can be purchased and used safely\u2014and for use cases that go far beyond financial speculation.\n\nThe only way forward at this point is through thoughtful, well-calibrated legislation that protects consumers from scams and conflicts of interest\u2014while still embracing the innovations of blockchain technology. Other countries around the globe have already reached this conclusion; the United States is falling behind.\n\nSo how do we not fall behind, yet also avoid more confusion and uncertainty? We recommend that U.S. legislators do three things:\n\nFirst, ensure that both consumers and investors are protected by requiring registration and supervision of centralized firms. Regulators should be probing for risk arising from custodial relationships, conflicts of interests, and use of digital assets in illicit finance. We have seen many examples already of these regulatory failings.\n\nSecond, any legislation should provide the entrepreneurs who have been building non-centralized networks and legitimate businesses in spite of this uncertain environment a pathway to compliance.\n\nFinally, laws and regulation should properly incentivize decentralization and community ownership and usage\u2014the key characteristics of crypto and blockchain technology that drive the true benefits to the public and next-generation internet that this technology offers.\n\nThere are some hopeful signs: Progress is being made in both the House and the Senate on such legislation. We applaud Chairmen Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and G.T. Thompson (R-Pa.) and Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) for attempting to create meaningful consumer protections through legislative frameworks that promote responsible innovation. We urge Congress to swiftly consider and pass such legislation before it\u2019s too late.\n\nMiles Jennings is general counsel and head of decentralization at a16z crypto and a former partner at Latham & Watkins.

        "title": "Judge Rules XRP Is Not A Security. What Does It Mean For Other Crypto? - Investopedia",
        "content": "The crypto industry celebrated Ripple's partial win in court on Thursday, as a judge has ruled XRP (XRPUSD) is not a security. While many crypto proponents see this as a sign these sorts of assets will be allowed to flourish in the U.S., some legal experts point out that there is still much more regulatory clarity needed.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS A Thursday court ruling in Ripple's case with the SEC indicated that the digital asset XRP is not a security.\n\nThe crypto industry has responded positively to the news, with crypto exchanges relisting XRP and many hoping this will lead to an end to the perceived war on crypto waged by the SEC.\n\nThe ruling will undoubtedly have an impact on the SEC's cases against Binance and Coinbase, and the fact that many U.S.-based exchanges have decided to relist XRP is seen as positive development for Binance and Coinbase's legal standing.\n\nWhile there is reason for crypto enthusiasts to rejoice over the short term, the reality is the Ripple ruling may not be the end-all-be-all method by which crypto assets are classified.\n\n\n\nWhat Does the XRP Ruling Mean for Crypto Assets?\n\nBitcoin is a commodity, and that brings clarity on how it is regulated and by which agency. But that is not the case for most cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contends that most cryptocurrency assets are securities and therefore must fall under the purview of securities laws. To that effect, the regulator has brought enforcement actions against issuers of the crypto tokens and as well as crypto exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase (COIN) that provided a platform to trade those tokens.\n\nWith the latest court ruling that XRP is not an investment contract itself, some members of the crypto industry are hopeful that the SEC will be forced to take a more hands off approach going forward. In addition to XRP, a number of other crypto assets that had previously been deemed securities, such as Solana (SOLUSD) and Polygon (MATIC), rallied on the news of the Ripple court order.\n\n\n\nAccording to Morrison Cohen Partner Jason Gottlieb, Thursday's ruling is a departure from what had previously been found in the SEC's cases against Telegram and Kik, where all initial coin offerings were part of one investment scheme. Now, it's possible that crypto assets could be traded as \"unrestricted securities\" in a situation where they are sufficiently decentralized or not sold directly to retail. Gottlieb also says it would be difficult to conclude that staking rewards are securities in the context of the Ripple ruling.\n\n\"All in all, while lots of thorny questions remain, the initial jubilation over the decision is justified,\" said Gottlieb. \"This new judicial guidance is a boon to token creators and markets, giving them new non-violative ways to issue and trade tokens.\"\n\n\n\nImplications for SEC Cases Against Binance and Coinbase\n\nIn addition to offering more clarity for crypto token issuers, Thursday's Ripple court order also opens up more flexibility in terms of what can be listed on exchanges, at least in the eyes of those operating the exchanges.\n\nThe XRP token \"is not in and of itself a \u201ccontract, transaction[,] or scheme\u201d that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract,\" a federal judge ruled Thursday. The order also said that XRP sold to institutional investors broke securities laws while XRP traded on exchanges by retail investors did not.\n\nThat could have some implications for the lawsuits the SEC has filed against Binance and Coinbase, which were both sued for operating unlicensed securities exchanges.\n\nCoinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal told CNBC that the crypto exchange's legal standing has been improved by the court order in the Ripple case. \"I thought we would win before this decision,\" said Grewal. \"We think this decision has only further strengthened the case.\"\n\nIn an episode of The Chopping Block, Brown Rudnick Partner Stephen Palley brought up the question of whether the SEC may go after the crypto exchanges that have now decided to relist XRP. \"If so, the exchanges are willing to fight,\" Palley said.\n\nPalley added that he's confident Coinbase would be raising this new legal opinion in their case against the SEC to illustrate that the transactions that occur on their platform are not securities transactions. \"The most important sign, at least short term, is that Coinbase and Kraken have relisted [XRP],\" Palley added. \"That, obviously, means something.\"\n\nThis is Not a Final Decision\n\nWhile the crypto industry can take the Ripple court order as a win for now, the reality is this ruling may not end up being the final say on the matter for two key reasons.\n\nFor one, the SEC still has the ability to appeal the decision made by the judge in the Ripple case. Secondly, the final word on crypto assets' regulatory classification may come from Congress by way of new legislation, as SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has been advocating.\n\nIn his own post on the matter, Brown Rudnick Partner Preston Byrne shared his belief that the SEC is likely to appeal this decision and see the ruling overturned. Gottlieb also added his own caveat that this is simply one decision from one district court that other courts could adopt or not follow.\n\nSpecifically, Byrne says the court made an error when it concluded \"programmatic\" sales of XRP on exchanges were not investment contracts. In his view, it's \"obvious to anyone active in the industry\" that Ripple is the principal promoter of XRP, no matter whether the purchasers of the digital asset on exchanges were aware they were purchasing from Ripple.\n\n\"My hope is that Congress will get its act together and decide that it\u2019s time for cryptocurrency tokens and cryptocurrency exchanges to receive their own purpose-built disclosure and supervisory frameworks which will take cryptocurrency regulation out of the slow and contradictory hands of our courts, and the politically motivated hands of the SEC,\" wrote Byrne. \"My expectations of Congress are, however, quite low.\"\n\n"
