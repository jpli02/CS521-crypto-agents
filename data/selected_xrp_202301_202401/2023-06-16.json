Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLondon-based enterprise blockchain solutions provider Quant has revealed its groundbreaking partnership with the Bank of England and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in their joint venture, the Rosalind project. The initiative aims to explore the potential of APIs for the development of CBDC systems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re proud to be part of the vendor team for #ProjectRosalind. Congratulations to all involved at @BIS_org and the @BankOfEngland. An important and successful project.#CBDC #DigitalPoundhttps://t.co/y44Jxasws4 \u2014 Quant (@quant_network) June 16, 2023\n\nThe market response to this groundbreaking partnership has been resoundingly positive, with Quant's native token, QNT, experiencing a remarkable surge of 7% at its peak. The substantial increase propelled QNT to the forefront of the crypto market's top performers, with its current trading price settling at $105.5.\n\nQNT to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nInterestingly, Ripple, another prominent player in the cryptocurrency sphere, previously collaborated with the Bank of England on a CBDC project centered on the digital pound. Adding to this, it was recently disclosed that Ripple forged a partnership with the central bank of Colombia to explore the prospects of a digital national currency.\n\nThese two significant developments offer valuable insights. First, the global momentum behind CBDCs continues to gain traction, affirming growing interest in this transformative technology. Second, competition within the CBDC solutions sector, particularly between Quant and Ripple, is set to intensify further.\n\nRipple, once perceived as the frontrunner, now faces formidable competition from Quant and other crypto companies that central banks of leading nations are eager to collaborate with. This latest partnership between Quant and the Bank of England undoubtedly strengthens the former's already impressive portfolio of high-level alliances."

        "title": "MDS Changes Could Have Ripple Effects on Nursing Home Readmissions, Citations - Skilled Nursing News",
        "content": "Staying informed about upcoming changes to the Minimum Data Sets (MDS) will be vital for skilled nursing operators come October, when the new changes are implemented. These changes include more finely-tuned definitions and more data collection.\n\nSection GG of MDS, which measures the functional status and goals of residents in their self-care, mobility, and communication capabilities, is often the most widely discussed change because it will directly impact reimbursement for skilled nursing operators. However, there are other changes that operators need to be aware of as well.\n\nAmong these changes are those pertaining to the data collection process on social determinants of health. With this measure, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recognizes the role played by social, economic, and environmental factors in health outcomes. CMS will now, for example, require data on social activity, and by extension social isolation, because it impacts mental health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also some changes related to refinements to definitions \u2013 and knowledge of these is important to avoid survey citations as well as coding and getting reimbursed correctly for services rendered.\n\nLeah Klusch, executive director of The Alliance Training Center, said that the accurate coding of the MDS is involved in almost every aspect of the operation of a skilled nursing facility.\n\n\u201cIf the person who\u2019s coding on the MDS does not know all of the definitional specifics for that item, they may just code the item inaccurately, or what they put on the MDS might be in the wrong place,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocial Determinants of Health\n\nExecutives at Health Dimensions Group, a management and consulting organization that serves senior living, post-acute, and long-term care providers, said that there are 10 different areas that are being affected by the changes to the MDS document itself, five of which are fairly major.\n\nOne of the overall new focuses of the new MDS is on social determinants of health, which will be addressed in sections A, B and D.\n\n\u201cSocial determinants are not genetics, they\u2019re not physical,\u201d said Heather Haberhern, SVP of Quality at HDG. \u201cThey\u2019re not necessarily even medical. They are the things that happen around us that really impact how we age and how our health is.\u201d\n\nExamples would include access to transportation, health literacy, and social isolation.\n\nCMS is increasingly acknowledging the influence of social, economic, and environmental factors on residents\u2019 health outcomes, and emphasizing the importance of addressing social determinants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important data section and the changes really reinforce the commitment that CMS made for us in October that has to do with behavioral health,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Madison, a clinical consultant for long term and senior care with Briggs Healthcare, said during a webinar this week that taking more data on social determinants of health will hopefully have a positive impact on readmissions.\n\n\u201cWe have to know where people are coming from and where we\u2019re going to send them back to and how we can help them go back successfully and not cause a readmission or worse for them and us,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also discussed the interview component of MDS data collection with the resident, and how there will be an increased emphasis on collecting accurate racial and ethnic data.\n\n\u201cWe were to interview people before but this is critical going forward,\u201d she said. \u201cYou ask the resident to select the category or categories that most closely respond to their ethnicity. It\u2019s not what the medical record says. It is not what you think they are from eyeballing them. You ask them to select and it can be a multiple choice. If the resident is unable to respond, you may ask a family member, a significant other and or a guardian or legally authorized representative.\u201d\n\nShe emphasized that staff training and utilizing federal training resources can help get staff up-to-date.\n\n\u201c[Social determinants of health] are conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, play and age that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt affects all of us, whether we\u2019re staff or residents or family.\u201d\n\nOther clarifications\n\nSome operators have said that survey citations they have received for elopement have been inaccurate and burdensome. The new MDS includes revisions of what is considered to be a resident elopement.\n\nElopement refers to the act of a resident leaving a healthcare facility without proper authorization or supervision, which can pose significant risks to their safety and well-being.\n\nThe new MDS includes further specification of what kinds of behavior can constitute harm to a resident in regard to elopement.\n\n\u201cThere was certainly a clarification of what\u2019s considered to be elopement, you know, all kinds of additions to that plus a state form and a state process that\u2019s now nationally controlled for facility reported incidents,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile it helps to clarify elopement, Haberhern stressed that focusing on staff retention can help mitigate accidents and elopements.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough people out there to bring in and sometimes we\u2019re keeping them for days, not for months or for years,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very hard to get them as well trained to care as deeply as we need them to and so on.\u201d"

        "title": "Trump's indictment has barely made a ripple in 2024 presidential race - Chicago Sun-Times",
        "content": "Exploring critical issues facing our democracy and searching for solutions.\n\nRarely does such astonishing political news have so little political effect.\n\nLast week Donald Trump distinguished himself as the first president ever to be formally indicted by the Department of Justice. Arraigned earlier this week, Trump faces 37 federal charges associated with mishandling classified documents, obstructing justice and lying to the FBI. These charges come while Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s competitor in the 2020 election, now sits in the White House and oversees the DOJ. And all signs point toward Biden and Trump squaring off once again in 2024.\n\nMembers of both parties recognize the gravity of these events. For Democrats, they serve as a shocking reminder of Trump\u2019s deceit, corruption, chicanery and unfitness for office. For Republicans, meanwhile, they demonstrate the lengths to which Democrats will go to keep Trump out of power.\n\nAmidst all the outrage, however, hardly anyone is changing their minds. Over the last week, the approval ratings of both politicians remain steady. Biden\u2019s continue to linger in the low 40s, while 50% to 55% of Republicans continue to prefer Trump as their nominee. Both politicians, meanwhile, are using these events to raise money in their shared quest to serve a second term. Trump held a fundraiser on the same day as his arraignment. Biden heads out to California on a fundraising tour next week.\n\nOpinion bug Opinion\n\nRather than disrupt the early dynamics of the 2024 presidential elections, Trump\u2019s indictment stabilized and accelerated them. The news reaffirmed the support of his core supporters and shrunk what little space exists for competitors to enter the race. According to a CBS poll, fully 80% of likely Republican voters said that Trump should be able to return to the White House even if convicted; and while a handful of Republicans admitted misgivings about his candidacy, more than twice as many insisted that the indictments changed their views \u201cfor the better.\u201d\n\nRelated Stunning details in latest Trump indictment show the importance of getting this case right\n\nHow can this be? How is it possible that something so anomalous and so outrageous is not turning our political world upside down? A good part of the answer, of course, has to do with the larger news cycle. These indictments are only the latest accusations leveled against a former president who was twice impeached; who is facing state charges for paying hush money to a porn actress in New York; whose involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection remains under federal investigation; and who is likely to face further charges in Georgia for election tampering.\n\nThe indictments also reaffirm what each party is already saying about the other. For Trump, they are only the latest chapter in a never-ending witch hunt, albeit one in which his main political opponent now is weaponizing the DOJ for his own political gain. And while Biden refuses to publicly comment on Trump\u2019s legal woes, his supporters cast them as further evidence of Trump\u2019s continuing threat to our national interests and democracy.\n\nA final contributing factor concerns the contents of the indictments themselves. In its 44-page indictment, DOJ\u2019s Special Counsel Jack Smith outlined, in rather shocking detail, Trump\u2019s reckless storage of documents containing highly sensitive state secrets; his efforts to thwart the federal government\u2019s repeated efforts to recover them; multiple instances of him cavalierly sharing the documents with people who lack any kind of government clearance; and his awareness that he was, in doing so, breaking the law.\n\nNever, however, does the special counsel explain why Trump behaved this way. Never does it present evidence of a particular plan, intention, or motive.\n\nAs a matter of legal responsibility, the DOJ need not do so. There are plenty of reasons to bring charges without having sorted out exactly why Trump did what he did. His actions alone are reason enough to hold him to account.\n\nBut for these charges to shake up the 2024 election, they need to fix Trump\u2019s actions within a larger plot. Did Trump intend to use state secrets to advance his family\u2019s business interests abroad? To manipulate what foreign nations might say or do in the upcoming presidential election? As some kind of get-out-of jail card? The DOJ doesn\u2019t say.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, of course, that Trump had no real purpose in mind. The documents may have merely served as props for his ego and proof of his unending sense of entitlement. If true, though, then his actions merely reveal character traits that we already know \u2014 and with which his supporters have long made peace.\n\nOver the last several years, political pundits have worried a great deal about the effects of misinformation and disinformation on our politics. The American electorate is supposedly roiling in a sea of lies, conspiracy theories, and fabrications. More startling still, though, may be the muted effect of very real, altogether unprecedented, and objectively alarming news \u2014 how a cannon ball shot by the federal government can slip into these present political waters without making the slightest splash.\n\nWilliam Howell is the Sydney Stein Professor of American Politics and the Director of the Center for Effective Government at the University of Chicago.
