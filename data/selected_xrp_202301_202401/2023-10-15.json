        "title": "Oil prices leap as ripple effect from Israel-Hamas war seen on global markets - The Jerusalem Post",
        "content": "Economists and market strategists are anticipating further ripple effects globally from the Middle East conflict, watching to see if the situation draws in other countries with the potential to increasingly drive up oil prices and send capital flowing to safe havens.\n\nIsrael was preparing on Saturday to launch a ground assault in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, after telling Palestinians living in the territory to flee south. The Israeli national security adviser, meanwhile, warned Lebanese militant group Hezbollah not to start a war on a second front.\n\n\"It looks like we\u2019re headed for a massive ground invasion of Gaza and a large-scale loss of life,\" said Ben Cahill, senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \"Anytime you have a conflict of this scale, you will have a market reaction.\"\n\nIn the past week, concerns about the conflict have fed through to asset prices, contributing to weakness in stocks on Friday with the S&P 500 .SPX down 0.5%. Safehaven assets saw buying with gold XAU=up more than 3% on Friday and the US dollar touching a one-week high. Oil prices leapt nearly 6% on Friday as investors assessed what the conflict could mean for supplies from nearby countries in the world's top oil producing region.\n\n\"If it looks like a broadening conflict, oil prices will rise further,\" said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics LLC in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nEconomic fallout of war\n\nAn expanding conflict would also likely cause inflation and, as a byproduct, interest rates around the world to accelerate, said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nHowever, while inflation and rates in other countries will likely rise in this worst-case scenario, the US could be the exception as foreign investors pour capital into what they deem a safehaven during global conflict, Baumohl noted.\n\n\"Interest rates could go down,\" he said. \"Expect the dollar to strengthen.\"\n\nOther fuels could also be impacted, as seen in recent developments such as Chevron halting natural gas exports through a major subsea pipeline between Israel and Egypt. Advertisement\n\n\"The bigger risk to the oil market is that this conflict draws in neighboring countries,\" said CSIS' Cahill.\n\nRising oil prices are unlikely to have a significant impact on US gas prices or consumer spending, analysts noted.\n\n\"The consumer is unlikely to see a significant impact on gas prices anytime soon,\" Englund said."

        "title": "Could XRP Be on Edge of Massive Run to $5 Amid Ripple vs. SEC Fight? - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "XRP appears to be on the cusp of a bullish surge to $5 with favorable court cases, institutional adoption, and an ending bear market.\n\nThe fifth largest crypto, XRP, currently trades at $0.4865 with a significant 24-hour volume of over half a billion dollars. While the whole crypto market wallows in a bear market, XRP is enshrouded with some unique circumstances that may see it breaking out of the bears, potentially leaving other digital assets.\n\nThe unique events surrounding XRP include its extended bear accumulation periods, the regulatory challenges with the US regulator, Ripple business partnerships, and financial institutions\u2019 adoption.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBesides, the Google-powered artificial intelligence software, Google Bard, affirmed that these circumstances would contribute to seeing XRP toward $5. Interestingly, these XRP-specific events have seen pivotal developments in recent weeks.\n\nCourt Cements XRP\u2019s Clear Regulatory Status\n\nEarly this month, the judge presiding over the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit declined the SEC\u2019s request to initiate an appeal against the ruling that XRP is not a security.\n\nRecall that in July, Judge Analisa Torres declared that XRP does not inherently qualify as a security based on the SEC\u2019s argument. While the legal battle subsists, the US court reaffirmed XRP\u2019s clear regulatory status. Therefore, the way is smooth for its potential to soar without any obstacles.\n\nMonths of Stockpile Frenzy, Market Forming Triangle\n\nSimilarly, prominent market experts have made a case for an unprecedented resurgence of XRP, having remained below the $1 mark for an extended duration.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThese analysts often refer to the six years since XRP\u2019s last all-time high (ATH), where the digital asset failed to break an ATH in the 2021 bull run, given the court case that it has now prevailed.\n\nOne prominent analyst, EGRAG, conducted an in-depth analysis and determined that XRP\u2019s accumulation phase has spanned 68 months thus far. Therefore, he projected a range of possibilities, with the most conservative estimate suggesting XRP could trade at $6.6, while the most optimistic outlook places it at $90.\n\nFurthermore, XRP\u2019s market performance since 2018 has formed a symmetrical triangle similar to the pattern witnessed prior to the 2018 ATH.\n\nFinancial Institutions\u2019 Adoption\n\nLast month, Japan payment giant SBI Remit launched an ambitious international money transfer service using XRP. Specifically, SBI Remit collaborated with Ripple and SBI Ripple Asia to utilize XRP to facilitate remittance services in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.\n\nOn the other hand, this month, the prominent luxury car brand Ferrari has proclaimed it will accept crypto like XRP for car purchases.\n\nXRP Growing Astronomically to $5\n\nGiven XRP\u2019s price at $0.4865, the digital asset needs to grow over 927% to reach $5. While the percentage suggests a formidable path ahead, XRP has exhibited tendencies for such astronomic growth in the past.\n\nFor example, XRP grew from $0.009482 in March 2017 to its ATH of $3.84 in January 2018. That is a growth rate of over 40,486% within ten months. Therefore, XRP climbing 927% to $5 may not be far-fetched.\n\nBesides, XRP now has a larger community of enthusiasts from the top banks and the broader crypto sphere, which was absent before it made its $3.84 ATH."

        "title": "Here's potential XRP price range if Ripple wins against the SEC - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The price of XRP has been shrouded in uncertainty due to the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While Ripple initially secured a victory when the court declared XRP was not a security, the cryptocurrency market anticipates that the case\u2019s final resolution will significantly impact the asset\u2019s price.\n\nIn this context, Finbold sought insights from Google Bard, an interactive artificial intelligence (AI) tool, to understand how XRP might trade if Ripple and its executives emerge victorious after the case.\n\nIn response to Finbold\u2019s inquiry, Google Bard stated that a favorable outcome for Ripple in its case against the SEC could lead to a substantial surge in the price of XRP. Bard\u2019s prediction suggests that, in the short term, the price of XRP could range from $2.50 to $3.00.\n\nApart from the SEC case outcome, Bard pointed out that the valuation of XRP is influenced by factors such as market sentiment, the overall regulatory landscape, and developments in Ripple\u2019s partnerships.\n\n\u201cBased on the factors I mentioned in my previous response, I believe that the price of XRP could range from $2.50 to $3.00 in the short term if Ripple wins its case against the SEC. This would represent a significant increase from its current price of around $0.50,\u201d the tool said.\n\nHowever, Bard cautioned that, due to the volatility of the crypto market, the price of XRP could fall within a range either higher or lower than the one provided. Notably, after Ripple\u2019s initial win, the value of XRP skyrocketed to almost $1 but was weighed down by overall market sentiments.\n\nStatus of Ripple case with SEC\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC is still ongoing, and the outcome remains uncertain, as the case is scheduled for trial in 2024. Ripple\u2019s president, Monica Long, has committed to pursuing the case to its conclusion, as reported by Finbold. She stated, \u201cThe company plans to continue to fight the case all the way through.\u201d\n\nThis commitment comes after Ripple secured a recent victory when the presiding judge denied the regulator\u2019s motion for an interlocutory appeal. In light of this development, John Deaton, a prominent lawyer advocating for XRP, has cast doubt on the likelihood of a trial in the case.\n\nDeaton expressed skepticism about the SEC\u2019s prospects if it chooses to pursue this high-profile case, emphasizing the numerous complexities the regulatory agency would face. He has pointed out that, due to these uncertainties, the SEC might consider settling the case and redirecting its focus to other high-profile litigations involving crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nBy press time, XRP was trading at $0.49, marking a correction of nearly 7% in the past seven days.\n\nXRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAccording to technical analysis based on one-day data obtained from TradingView, XRP currently exhibits a bearish trend. The summary indicates a \u2018sell\u2019 signal at 10, while moving averages suggest a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 13. Oscillators are neutral at 9.\n\nXRP technical analysis.
