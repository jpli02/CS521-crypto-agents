        "title": "Why a recovery for XRP looks imminent - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "XRP\u2019s whale transactions have seen a spike in recent days.\n\nHowever, the token may fall below $0.60 before a jump.\n\nRipple\u2019s [XRP] price decreased by 8.80% over the last seven days. However, the token could be on the verge of a recovery, if on-chain data is to be believed.\n\nNotably, according to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis per Santiment, whale transactions between $100k \u2013 $1 million witnessed a rise over the past few days. Historically, whenever whale transactions have picked up at a time when XRP falls, prices have witnessed a rise.\n\nNever a straight line to revival\n\nNow could be the perfect time to watch out for the significant changes in XRP\u2019s price. To do this, AMBCrypto decided to take a look at the metrics.\n\nWhen we viewed TradingView\u2019s XRP/USD 4-hour chart, we found that the 20-day EMA (blue) had a downward crossover below the 50 EMA (yellow). This crossover is a bearish sign. So, XRP could fall below the $0.60 threshold soon.\n\nIf the EMA position is accompanied by high trading volume, the drawdown may be faster. But at press time, Ripple\u2019s trading volume decreased, indicating a drop in spot trading.\n\nAnother indicator we evaluated was the Money Flow Index (MFI). The MFI measures the selling and buying pressure by looking at the price and volume data. At the time of writing, the oscillator stood at 23.53.\n\nThus, evidence of XRP\u2019s potential recovery could also be found in the MFI. For the uninitiated, an MFI value of above 80 is considered overbought. When the indicator is below 20, it is termed as oversold.\n\nShould the MFI hit 20.00 or below, XRP might reverse its direction to the upside.\n\nOpen Interest declines\n\nCorrespondingly, the token\u2019s Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) had flattened at the time of writing. For confirmation of XRP\u2019s uptrend, the accumulation has to increase. If this happens, then XRP may be able to hit $0.65 in the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, Open Interest around XRP had declined at press time, based on AMBCrypto\u2019s evaluation of Coinglass\u2019 data. At press time, the Open Interest was down to $605 million.\n\nOpen Interest is the amount of liquidity allocated to open positions in the Futures market. When the Open Interest increases, it implies a surge in market interest.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nRead Ripple\u2019s [XRP] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nXRP\u2019s waning Open Interest meant that traders were refraining from opening more positions at the time of the report. This lack of interest could be due to the current market uncertainty.\n\nAs matters stand, XRP continues to have the potential to rise, but investors may have to brace themselves for another decrease first."

        "title": "Important Ripple (XRP) Announcement for XRPL Projects - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nRipple has awarded $1.3 million through XRPL Grants to 22 projects across Web3 sectors like GameFi, DeFi, and NFTs, with recipients selected by a global expert panel.\n\nKey projects include EVM Finance, DeXfi, and ChatXRP, with funding ranging from under $10,000 to over $100,000, supporting Ripple\u2019s global expansion.\n\nIn other news, Ripple is advancing in its SEC lawsuit, and XRP experiences significant whale activity, along with its relisting on the CEX.io exchange.\n\nRipple\u2019s developer arm has unveiled the recipients of XRPL Grants Wave 6 and is granting $1.3 million to support 22 projects from 13 countries leveraging XRP Ledger (XRPL).\n\nThe recipients showcased a lineup of groundbreaking projects spanning various sectors within the Web3 realm, including GameFi, DeFi, NFTs, developer tooling, and more. Each project was reviewed by a global panel of judges with vast expertise in these areas.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the next wave of applications will reopen in 2024.\n\nThis investment in new projects aligns with XRPL\u2019s strategy to enhance its future potential. Similarly, Xahau, the first XRPL\u2019s smart contract layer, is on the horizon with ongoing upgrades, so the sidechain will likely benefit the XRPL ecosystem as the next wave of projects joins in.\n\nThe Most Important Projects in XRPL\n\nAmong the notable recipients were DeFi solutions working towards making Web3 and DeFi more accessible in terms of user experience and simplicity. Among these is EVM Finance, a unified interface for DeFi, essentially a hub for asset management, trading, transactions, and NFT launches.\n\nAnother awardee, DeXfi, positioned itself as another DeFi one-stop-shop on the XRPL, providing users with similar options and features. Meanwhile, Chris Winkler, the brain behind DeXfi, secured funding of $50,000 to propel the project forward.\n\nChatXRP stood out as the sole recipient in the AI space, receiving an award of $75,000. Functioning as a stress-free gateway to Web 3.0 services, ChatXRP simplifies XRPL interactions through its user-friendly interface.\n\nIn the education sector, EpicTask was recognized, while sustainability-focused projects EUA Carbon Token and Meta-Carbon also made the list of awardees. These projects highlight XRPL\u2019s commitment to fostering innovation across various domains.\n\nThe financial support ranges from microgrant funding for seven projects in the lowest tier \u2014below $10,000\u2014 to substantial funding exceeding $100,000 for six projects. Moreover, 55% of the awardees are based outside of the US. This aligns with Ripple\u2019s decision to expand overseas as the company\u2019s executive considers other jurisdictions more crypto-friendly."

        "title": "Wall Street Expert Convinced Ripple Will Go Public In May 2024: Can It Drive XRP Price To $10? - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe murmurs in the crypto corridors have grown louder about the future of American fintech payments company Ripple Labs, which has been mired in a lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since December 2020.\n\nA Wall Street financial whiz has commented on the potential plans of Ripple to float an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the coming year. Which begs the question: will the price of XRP hit $10 if Ripple conducts an IPO?\n\nRipple IPO Coming In May 2024?\n\nBestselling author and Wall Street expert Linda P. Jones has indicated that there may be a Ripple IPO next year.\n\nSpeaking during an interview with Linqto, Jones offered in-depth insights and expected dates for when Ripple might go public. She also shared her thoughts on the potential valuation of Ripple\u2019s stock.\n\nHere is my interview with Linqto today. We talked about when Ripple might go public, my back of the envelope calculation for what the stock might be worth and potential acquisition targets. #xrp #xrparmy #ripple #Uphold #linqto @linqto #polysign #preipo #privateequity\u2026 \u2014 Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) November 17, 2023\n\nRipple\u2019s chief executive officer, Brad Garlinghouse, first floated the idea of going the IPO route back in 2020, when he indicated that the move would be \u201ca natural evolution for our company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore recently, rumblings of Ripple going public started when the company posted a job listing for a Shareholder Communications Senior Manager. Notably, the role and responsibilities listed for the potential candidate reflect the business practices of a public firm.\n\nWhile Ripple has not formally declared its intention to go public as of now, Jones believes investor pressure might push the company\u2019s executives towards this course. She elaborated, \u201cWell, like I said, Ripple was founded in 2012, and I think their investors want the exit, and Brad [Garlinghouse] will get pressure to do that even though they don\u2019t need the money from the IPO.\u201d\n\nIn Jones\u2019 opinion, Ripple could potentially launch its IPO on May 15, 2024. She noted that this would be an ideal time for the payments firm, explaining:\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity if Ripple wants to go public next year, that mid-May would be an ideal time, right around May 15. That\u2019s my first target that they might go public if everything \u2014 the stars, the Sun, and the Moon \u2014 lined up, and they wanted to go public. If it doesn\u2019t happen, then I think it probably won\u2019t happen until 2025.\u201d\n\nCould XRP Reach $10?\n\nThe Wall Street investment veteran\u2019s forecast hinges on a wider economic outlook, envisioning a meteoric bull run buoyed by lowering inflation and interest rates, thus creating a favourable environment for public offerings.\n\nFor some market participants, a Ripple IPO could lead to the company garnering more attention and legitimacy from institutional investors, banks, and the broader financial industry, which could be an indirect boon to the perception of XRP.\n\nAt press time, XRP is changing hands for $0.612 after a 1.4 percent rise on the day. If Ripple\u2019s IPO is a success, XRP could easily reach the coveted $10 mark."

        "title": "'This must stop,' UN chief says as deaths, displacement ripple across Gaza - UN News",
        "content": "Top UN officials echoed that call to improve conditions for Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people, 1.7 million of which have been displaced since the 7 October Hamas attack in Israel resulted in the killing of 1,200 Israelis and capture of 240 hostages. Since then, more than 11,000 people have been killed in besieged Gaza.\n\n\u201cThis war is having a staggering and unacceptable number of civilian casualties, including women and children, every day,\u201d UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cThis must stop. I reiterate my call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.\u201d\n\nVolker T\u00fcrk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), said in a statement on Sunday that: \u201cThe horrendous events of the past 48 hours in Gaza beggar belief.\u201d\n\nTweet URL UN_News_Centre\n\nGrowing despair\n\n\u201cThe killing of so many people at schools turned shelters, hundreds fleeing for their lives from Al-Shifa Hospital amid continuing displacement of hundreds of thousands in southern Gaza are actions which fly in the face of the basic protections civilians must be afforded under international law,\u201d Mr. T\u00fcrk said, stressing that failing to adhere to these rules may constitute war crimes.\n\nAccording to the UN agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA), which issued its latest situation report on Sunday, nearly 884,000 internally displaced persons are sheltering in 154 UNRWA installations across all five governorates of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cJust getting into one of the shelters makes you burst into tears,\u201d an UNRWA employee said. \u201cChildren looking for food and water and standing in queues for over six hours just to get a piece of bread or a bottle of water. People are literally sleeping on streets here in Khan Younis as thousands keep escaping from the north.\u201d\n\nAttacks on schools, shelters\n\nIn less than 24 hours, two UNRWA schools sheltering displaced families were hit, causing \u201cmany deaths\u201d and injuries, mostly of women and children, in addition to other deadly incidents across Gaza and the West Bank against the backdrop of soaring humanitarian needs, UNRWA said.\n\nMr. T\u00fcrk said at least three other schools hosting displaced Palestinians have also been attacked.\n\n\u201cThis must stop,\u201d he said. \u201cHumanity must come first. A ceasefire \u2013 on humanitarian and human rights grounds \u2013 is desperately needed. Now.\u201d\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, who heads UNRWA, said in a statement on Sunday that the attacks are \u201cjust cruel\u201d.\n\n\u201cI watched with sheer horror reports from an attack on the Al-Fakhoura UNRWA school-turned-shelter in northern Gaza,\u201d he said.\n\nClassrooms sheltering displaced families were hit and at least 24 people were reported killed in the strike. Up to 7,000 people were in the school at the time, the UNRWA chief said. On Friday, following strikes on the UNRWA Al-Falah/Zeitoun school in Gaza City, ambulances could not reach the school, where 4,000 people were sheltering.\n\nSoundcloud\n\nBeyond \u2018collateral damage\u2019\n\nSince 7 October, at least 176 people sheltering in the agency\u2019s schools were reported killed and 800 wounded during Israeli bombardments, Mr. Lazzarini said.\n\n\u201cThe large number of UNRWA facilities hit and the number of civilians killed cannot just be \u2018collateral damage\u2019,\u201d he said, adding that the UN agency routinely shares the buildings\u2019 coordinates with parties to the conflict.\n\n\u201cThis vicious war is reaching a point of no return when all rules are disrespected, in overt disregard for civilian lives,\u201d he said, calling and appealing \u201conce again for humanity to prevail and for a humanitarian ceasefire right now.\"\n\nWHO Palestinian civil defence responders search the rubble of a building in the aftermath of an air strike in the Gaza Strip. (file)\n\nAl-Shifa Hospital\n\nIsraeli military operations have been continuing inside and around Al-Shifa Hospital, with UN colleagues that visited the site on Saturday describing it as a \u201cdeath zone\u201d.\n\nOn Sunday, WHO and humanitarian partners helped to evacuate infants in critical condition.\n\nMedical personnel, patients and civilians had fled the hospital over the weekend, ordered to do so by the Israeli military, UNRWA\u2019s chief said, adding that hundreds were seen making their way south on foot, at great risk to their lives, health and safety.\n\nWHO reported on Sunday that six Palestine Red Crescent ambulances transported the babies to Al-Helal Al-Emirati Maternity Hospital, where there are receiving urgent care.\n\n\u201cFurther missions are being planned to urgently transport remaining patients and health staff out of Al-Shifa Hospital,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a social media post on Sunday.\n\nWHO A joint humanitarian team, led by WHO, accessed Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza to assess the situation on the ground.\n\nSouthern Gaza\n\nIn the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, the Israeli Defense Forces are dropping leaflets demanding residents go to unspecified \u201crecognized shelters\u201d, even as strikes take place across Gaza, according to OHCHR.\n\n\u201cAlready displaced Palestinians, deprived by extreme restrictions on lifesaving assistance, are struggling to meet their basic needs, forced into ever-diminishing, overcrowded, unsanitary unsafe spaces,\u201d Mr. T\u00fcrk said.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of warnings, Israel is obliged to protect civilians wherever they are,\u201d the UN human rights chief said. \u201cThe pain, dread and fear etched on the faces of children, women and men is too much to bear. How much more violence, bloodshed and misery will it take before people come to their senses? How many more civilians will be killed?\u201d\n\n\u00a9 WFP/Ali Jadallah UNRWA schools are sheltering more than 800,000 displaced people in Gaza during the Israel-Palestine crisis.\n\nCritical needs\n\nMeanwhile, needs are rising, UN agencies said.\n\nThe entry of fuel critical for the overall humanitarian operations across the enclave has been largely banned since 7 October when the war began. Limited fuel deliveries began on Wednesday, and UNRWA has been informed that, as of Saturday, 120,000 litres of fuel will be delivered every two days going forward.\n\nUN agencies have said this is not enough for all humanitarian activities, and that at least 200,000 litres per day are required to, among other things, power generators to provide electricity to hospitals and to operate water facilities. Both services have been cut since the start of the conflict.\n\nFuel is also critical for telecommunications networks, UNRWA said, noting that Gaza\u2019s fourth communications blackout on Friday meant the agency was unable to transport trucks of humanitarian assistance arriving via Egypt.\n\nRising death toll\n\nAs of 10 November, over 11,078 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October; two thirds of them are reportedly children and women, the UNRWA report said. Due to the collapse in the Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health services and communications in the north, casualty data has not been updated for the last five days.\n\nMedia reports indicate the number of Palestinian deaths is nearly 12,000.\n\nIsrael reported that around 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, the vast majority on 7 October, according to the UN humanitarian agency (OCHA).\n\nOn Saturday, one UNRWA colleague was killed in the northern area due to strikes. In total, 104 colleagues have been killed since the beginning of the war, the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict in the Organization\u2019s history, according to UN Palestine refugee agency.\n\nWest Bank\n\nViolent incidents, deaths and injuries struck several areas of the West Bank, including the Fara\u2019a and Jenin refugee camps, according to UNRWA\u2019s situation report.\n\nOCHA reported that since 7 October, 198 Palestinians, including 52 children, have been killed by Israeli security forces and eight, including one child, by Israeli settlers.\n\nIn the Balata refugee camp in Nablus on Saturday, Israeli security forces launched an operation, entering with an armoured bulldozer and mobilizing a drone that fired missiles towards the Fatah office, killing five, injuring two others and damaging homes and shops, according to UNRWA."
