        "content": "(L-R \u2013 Standing) Ms Prasanti, Segment Head CAIE; Ms Baljeet Oberoi, Principal, Oakridge Bachupally; Ms Swarna Diana, Co-Organizer, TEDxOakridgeBachupally & Ms Vaishnavi Namdar (Sitting 5th from right), Organizer, TEDxOakridgeBachupally; along with the rest of the students\u2019 core team; at the TEDx event, hosted by students of Oakridge International School, Bachupally on the theme of \u201cRipples\u201d, at the school premises.\n\nHyderabad, 14th January 2023: Students leaders at Oakridge International School, Bachupally organized a TEDx event on the theme of \u201cRipples\u201d, today at the school premises at Bachupally. The theme was chosen to highlight that even small actions\u2019 impact on creating positive change. With over 100 attendees, the event featured a line-up of dynamic speakers sharing their life experiences and insights on the theme of \u201cRipples\u201d, including Actor Divi Vadthya and trans rights activist & motivational speaker Naaz Joshi, as well as the students of Oakridge Bachupally, Mr. Rohan Poduri, Mr. Akshith Garapati, and Mr. Adarsh Mangipudi.\n\nThe event explored the idea that small actions can have a big impact and inspired attendees to consider the power of their own actions in creating positive change in their communities and the world. Ms. Divi Vadthya, Big Boss 4 contestant and actor (\u201cMaharshi\u201d, \u201cGodfather\u201d and \u201cGinna\u201d), said, \u201cThis rock (scrambled tissue) symbolizes the gigantic decision that I had taken. This created massive ripples in my life \u2013 to become an actor. When I made the decision to become an actor, I knew there would be extreme effects on me as a person \u2013 both positive and negative effects. All I had to do was make the positive dominate the negatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was born a boy who shall not be named, I was loved and pampered by everyone till the age of 7,\u201d excerpt from the speech of Naaz Joshi, a trans rights activist & motivational speaker who spoke about her journey and how a childhood event of molestation has put her through a roller coaster of experience through which she found herself and went on to become the three-time champion of the \u201cMiss World Diversity Pageant\u201d and India\u2019s first-ever transgender international beauty queen.\n\nAddressing the event, Ms. Baljeet Oberoi, Principal at Oakridge Bachupally, shared an account of her childhood memory while emphasizing the importance of empathy and tranquillity. Speaking on the impact of small actions on the world, the principal shared her thoughts on non-toxic positivity and the significance of listening to the concerns of others. Referencing a quote by Mother Teresa, \u201cI alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples,\u201d the speech ended with a room full of applause.\n\n\u201cFrom watching TED Talks as a child to now organizing this event, is something I take utmost pride in. I learnt how some simple changes can have an everlasting impact on life and wish to reverberate the same through the event, \u201c said Vaishnavi Namdar, event organizer.\n\n\u201cWhen our consistent focus is on leading a passionate and meaningful life, we inadvertently create striking ripples of inspiration in the lives around us\u201d, said Ms. Swarna Diana, TEDx Co-organiser. She further added, \u201cWith ripples as the theme for TEDxOakridgeBachupally 2023, my idea is to spur every son and daughter to \u2018Be a ripple\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe event featured an array of cultural activities, from band performances to workshops on painting & Dance performances focused on the theme of ripples. All the activities at the TEDxOakridgeBachupally event underlined the Ripple Effect and how we can harness the power of small actions to create positive change. The student speakers, Mr. Akshith Garapati and Mr. Adarsh Mangipudi took the stage to share their rewarding experiences, which transformed them and shaped their respective identities.\n\n\u201cHow can I be myself, when I see a stranger in the mirror\u201d said Mr. Rohan Poduri, a DP2 student speaking on how he found his form of self-expression and went on a journey of self-discovery. \u201cThe reflection of myself I saw in this distorted pool of emotions and changed had become just a little bit clearer, this idea of ripples has exposed me to several negative situations. It was these same experiences that made the image of ME clearer one bit at a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarvels happen when you get a fresh set of eyes on a problem at hand. It ensures that the pebbles you throw have ripples that are truly infinite in effect\u201d, says Mr. Akshith, IBDP 1 at Oakridge Bachupally.\n\n\u201cNever underestimate big effect of small things because even those small things can create huge ripples\u201d, said Adarsh Mangipudi, a 14-year-old from Oakridge Bachupally with a burning passion for sports and athletics."
