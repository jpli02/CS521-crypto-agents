        "content": "It is unclear if this latest speculation relates to the controversial XRP buyback proposal.\n\nRumors have made the rounds in the last few days that XRP may be backed by gold, with influencers predicting a price as high as $100 for the token in such a scenario.\n\nIt is unclear where this particular speculation originates from. However, it could be an interpretation of the controversial XRP buyback proposal, which resurfaced again early this year.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRecall that Valhil Capital\u2019s Jimmy Vallee came up with the XRP buyback theory in 2021 with the assumption that XRP would become the world\u2019s reserve currency. According to Vallee, for this to happen, governments must own large quantities of the token, necessitating a buyback.\n\nThe Valhil Capital managing director drawing comparisons between his theory and the Bretton Woods Agreement asserted that this buyback would not occur on the secondary market but at a fixed rate as it was with gold. The lawyer placed this fixed value between $37,500 and $50,000 per XRP.\n\nAs reported, Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz expressed that the proposal looked like a scam.\n\nSimilarly, former Ripple Director Matt Hamilton debunked the latest rumors that XRP Will be backed by gold, stating, \u201cyou can\u2019t back XRP itself with gold.\u201d According to Hamilton, what is possible is to track gold by creating an XAU token on the XRP Ledger.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA view supported by the former Ripple director explained that to back 1 XRP with 1 ounce of gold, you would need 2.8 million tons of gold for the 100 billion XRP token supply. Hamilton pointed out the impracticality of this as humans have only managed to mine about 208,874 tons of gold in our history. Hamilton asserted that an even more significant concern is that XRP has a finite supply while gold inflates by about 0.3% annually.\n\nIt is worth noting that the XRP community is no stranger to conspiracy theories and speculation. Schwartz, in the past, has had to debunk narratives that XRP traded as high as $327k on a private ledger."

        "title": "Ripple Calls For Recusal Of Gensler From Crypto Cases - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to await a decision after the final briefs were submitted by both parties about a month ago. The latest development in the lawsuit was the intervention of Forbes journalist Dr. Roslyn Layton, who filed a motion to intervene to ask the court for access to the Hinman speech documents.\n\nNevertheless, Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty has repeatedly pointed out the SEC\u2019s misconduct in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, he wrote that SEC chairman Gary Gensler is a political liability for failing to establish proper regulation for over 40 million Americans who own cryptocurrencies.\n\nRipple CLO Demands Gensler\u2019s Withdrawal\n\nIn his latest tweet, Alderoty draws attention to a gross misconduct by Gary Gensler that may yet be his undoing. The Ripple CLO writes:\n\nCrypto lawyer PSA: Chair Gensler has again proclaimed that every cryptocurrency, except BTC, is an unregistered security. He now must recuse himself from voting on any enforcement case that raises that issue since he has prejudged the outcome. Antoniu v. SEC (8th Cir. 1989).\n\nAlderoty\u2019s tweet alludes to an interview by Gensler in New York Magazine in which he stated that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d is a security. In making this unequivocal and clear statement, however, Gensler may have erred, as Alderoty notes, citing Antoniu v. SEC.\n\nIn that case, the defendant SEC barred a stockbroker from employment with a firm for violating federal securities laws. The SEC initiated proceedings to permanently bar the stockbroker from all employment in the securities field.\n\nHowever, an SEC commissioner made a monumental mistake, the court later ruled. While the proceeding was pending, the commissioner called the ban permanent.\n\nThe court found that the commissioner\u2019s comments about the permanent ban on the stockbroker\u2019s employment while the case was pending showed that the commissioner had prejudged the issue. The Commissioner\u2019s continued participation in the debarment proceeding violated due process.\n\nWith his recent statement, Gary Gensler has thus disqualified himself from participating in any vote on a crypto-related securities case. As Alderoty explains, Gensler must now recuse himself from voting on any enforcement case since he has prejudged the outcome.\n\nSEC Faces Another Battleground\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC is also facing a new battlefield to fight with a XRP community attorney. Fred Rispoli of Hodl Law sued the SEC two months ago, asking the court to declare that Ether and the Ethereum network are not securities.\n\nRemarkably, the SEC has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. In its motion, the SEC makes this stunning statement:\n\nHodl Law\u2019s own allegations make clear that the SEC has not reached a final decision about the Ethereum network or Ether.\n\nYet again, the SEC and Gensler contradict themselves. The first hearing day in the case is scheduled for March 13.\n\nAt press time, XRP was trading at $0.3741, down 0.3% within the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Morning Tick, Chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Ripple price could break key support level as regulatory jitters linger - FXStreet",
        "content": "Should there be a breakthrough in the court case or ruling in favor of XRP, expect a massive relief rally to unfold. Quite quickly, Ripple price would take out both moving averages at $0.38 and $0.39 to trade near $0.40. A short breather there would open up the window for more bulls to join and create a breakout above $0.42 with a 28% profit nearby.\n\nXRP could tank further if this negative news surrounding the cryptocurrency continues. With an already fragile trading environment, from a purely technical point of view, a full unwind of the profits for 2023 could be underway. That means roughly 20% is at risk of being erased from XRP\u2019s performance .\n\nRipple price is sliding again by 1% during the ASIA PAC session this Tuesday. The negative price action occurs as regulatory pressure emerges again with Ripple\u2019s lawyer in the SEC court case demanding that SEC Chair Gary Gensler recuse himself over a past statement where he said all altcoins were unregistered securities. This adds additional bearish pressure on the price action, possibly seeing XRP drop below $0.37.\n\nRipple (XRP) price is set to tank another 13% as the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) escalates again. Ripple\u2019s lawyer suggested that the US SEC Chair recuse himself over a past claim concerning Bitcoin. Meanwhile, rumors are simmering that XRP could be backed with gold, which eats into the credibility of the top three cryptocurrencies.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nGary Gensler is a US public servant and financial regulator who now serves as the Head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With his recent regulatory measures, Gensler has often come under fire. Senator Tom Emmer of Minnesota has criticized him for his regulatory flaws.\n\nOthers have expressed their disapproval of the manner the SEC is conducting the case against Ripple and LBRY. Also, with regard to the pointless raids and their failure to stop the entire FTX scandal.\n\nGary Gensler, the head of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), outlined his reasoning for thinking that all crypto tokens other than bitcoin are securities. This, needless to say, has received plenty of criticism. Let\u2019s explore.\n\nAlderoty slams Gensler\n\nIn a recent tweet, the Chief Legal Officer of Ripple, Stuart Alderoty described how Chair Gensler had once more declared that all cryptocurrencies, with the exception of Bitcoin (BTC), are unregistered securities. He is now required to abstain from voting in any enforcement case that brings up that subject because he has already formed an opinion on the result for SEC v. Antoniu (8th Cir. 1989)\n\nCrypto lawyer PSA: Chair Gensler has again proclaimed that every cryptocurrency, except BTC, is an unregistered security. He now must recuse himself from voting on any enforcement case that raises that issue since he has prejudged the outcome. Antoniu v. SEC (8th Cir. 1989) \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) February 27, 2023\n\nThe question in SEC v. Antoniu was whether the commissioner\u2019s ongoing involvement in the disbarment proceedings was an infraction of due process. The commissioner\u2019s words on the stockbroker\u2019s permanent ban from employment in the securities industry while the proceedings were ongoing, according to the court, showed that the commissioner had already made up his mind about the case.\n\nOthers support Stuart Alderoty\n\nAttorney John Deaton, who represents thousands of XRP holders as an amicus curiae in the SEC litigation against Ripple, backed up Alderoty\u2019s claims. Deaton called the Ripple lawyer\u2019s position a \u201cBrilliant move\u201d and said it was important to bring it up in front of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nAnother pro-XRP lawyer, Bill Morgan, affirmed Alderoty\u2019s assertions and said that Gensler has persisted in making these allegations despite the fact that most cryptocurrencies have not been the subject of investigations.\n\n\ud83d\ude02 this is actually correct. Brilliant point. He has prejudged every crypto on this issue before investigations have been conducted or even commenced about must coins. What sought of reckless legal advice would conclude all cryptos are securities w/o considering the facts of each https://t.co/W0r8gzjL3a \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) February 28, 2023\n\nCrypto lawyers weighed in on Gary Gensler\u2019s statements about crypto regulation, claiming that the Securities and Exchange Commission lacks the legal authority to control the industry. Alexander Grieve, Jake Chervinsky, Logan Bolinger, Jason Brett, and Gabriel Shapiro are just a few of the industry insiders and attorneys who have shared their opinions.\n\nMarc Fagel comes in support\n\nMarc Fagel, a former regional director for the Securities and Exchange Commission, refuted these allegations by pointing out the distinction between an administrative proceeding and voting on enforcement measures. Fagel asserts that the SEC commissioners and Chair serve as judges in a litigated administrative process, which the SEC no longer brings. Yet, they defer to the courts when authorizing acts taken by the enforcement section. Fagel contends that the precedent does not hold because of this.\n\nTo conclude,\n\nThe SEC seems to be facing criticism for every step they take these days, but they keep following the same pattern. The absence of clear guidelines has led to issues."
