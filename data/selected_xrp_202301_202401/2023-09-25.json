        "content": "The XRP community recently spotlighted Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s commendation of Ripple in 2009 amid sustained XRP criticisms from Max Keiser.\n\nWhile the renowned Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser continues to deride XRP, proponents of the digital asset have unearthed a statement favoring Ripple from Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIn multiple posts on the X platform recently, Max Keiser mocked that XRP is a centralized cryptocurrency. One of his statements was that people investing in XRP are wasting their funds on what he believes is meaningless.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin maximalist, \u201cA fortune in a centralized fiat-shitcoin like XRP is meaningless.\u201d\n\nA fortune in a centralized fiat-shitcoin like XRP is meaningless https://t.co/otXwZdHEGe \u2014 Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) September 24, 2023\n\nIn response to Keiser\u2019s statement, a notable XRP influencer highlighted a comment the founder of Bitcoin made about Ripple fourteen years ago. Satoshi\u2019s remark read in part:\n\n\u201cRipple is interesting in that it\u2019s the only other system that does something with trust besides concentrate it into a central server.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDid Satoshi Commend Ripple [XRP]?\n\nNotably, the pro-XRP influencer spotlighted Satoshi\u2019s statement to show Keiser that while he loved Bitcoin and hated XRP, the founder of Bitcoin praised the Ripple protocol.\n\nIt is worth clarifying that the comment from Satoshi came three years before XRP Ledger (XRPL) went live. Specifically, Satoshi commented in 2009 about the original Ripple protocol dubbed \u2018RipplePay.\u2019\n\nBesides, the authenticity of Satoshi\u2019s comment on Ripple is debatable. A site that published the statement in 2009 stated:\n\n\u201cAs with all private emails, there are limits on our ability to verify the trustworthiness of the material, but the consensus is that these emails are accurate and do not contradict anything else Satoshi wrote.\u201d\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the concept behind Ripple Lab started much earlier than 2012. According to Wikipedia sources, Ripple started 2004 with Ryan Fugger, a prominent software engineer.\n\nMoreover, in a similar conversation thread, Ripple\u2019s CTO David Schwartz confirmed that Saotshi did comment on RipplePay. He emphasized that RipplePay was the original Ripple system, and that the XRPL is only different from it due to the use of XRP as a native token."

        "content": "Ripple\u2019s XRP Ledger (XRPL) is rolling out an upgrade as part of a two-week activation countdown, with backing from over 80% of validators.\n\nThe amendment aims to reduce obscured order books, improving XRPL\u2019s overall functionality.\n\nXRPL introduces fixReducedOffersV1\n\nXRPL is gearing up for new features, and users on the Ripple v1.11.0 or earlier versions are urged to update their software, particularly for the critical fixReducedOffersV1 addressing DEX issues. For the upgrade to get executed, an 80% consensus must be reached within a 14-day period.\n\nAccording to the XRPL v1.12.0 update, fixReducedOffersV1 upgrade\u2019s goal is to reduce obscured order books caused by reduced offers, thereby improving the overall functionality of the XRPL.\n\nThis amendment also allows protocol changes with 80% validator support within two weeks, prompting users to upgrade for continued engagement. From the taker\u2019s standpoint, fixReducedOffersV1 can enhance exchange rates on DEXs, making reduced offers more appealing.\n\nWithout these amendments, reduced offers may have unfavorable rates, hindering decentralized brokerage platforms on XRPL.\n\nIn September, XRPL rolled out version 1.12.0, featuring significant additions like fixReducedOffersV1.

        "content": "Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are expected to engage in additional courtroom battles during the second quarter of 2024, subsequent to the occurrence of the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event. What implications may this have for the price movement of XRP?\n\nAlthough the court has ruled in favor of Ripple Labs in \u2018a partial victory,\u2019 it is important to note that the legal dispute is still ongoing. The attainment of a resolution seems to be a distant prospect, with indications suggesting that it is probable to occur only in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nA prospective trial date is being established in the continuing legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC. Given that the available days of both sides do not coincide prior to the period above, it is very probable that the trial will be scheduled between April 22 and 26, shortly after the occurrence of the Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAug. 9 filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Source: PACER\n\nFinbold engaged OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT on September 25 about the potential ramifications of SEC v Ripple\u2019s return to court in the aftermath of the Bitcoin halving. ChatGPT, in its response, offered a nuanced assessment of the situation, highlighting five key factors.\n\nChatGPT highlights potential factors\n\nThe outcome of Ripple-SEC negotiations can influence XRP\u2019s price by boosting investor confidence if the resolution is positive. However, it noted:\n\n\u201cHistorically, Bitcoin halvings are followed by market volatility, potentially affecting XRP\u2019s price temporarily.\u201d\n\nIt also noted:\n\n\u201cXRP\u2019s price might rise ahead of news events (like negotiations) and fall afterward as investors take profits.\u201d\n\nCritical points on XRP price impact. Source: ChatGPT\n\nThe outcome of the legal case can provide regulatory clarity for XRP, impacting investor sentiment. Finally, it stressed the overall cryptocurrency market conditions, adoption, tech advancements, and global economic factors will also affect XRP\u2019s price.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nAfter Ripple\u2019s victory over the SEC on July 13, the price of XRP experienced a notable absence of bullish momentum, resulting in a sustained downward trajectory. Given Ripple\u2019s legal battle with the SEC slated for 2024, it wouldn\u2019t be unexpected to witness a continued decline in the value of the remittance token.\n\nXRP has demonstrated notable resilience in the crypto market over the past year, surpassing 63% of the top 100 digital assets. This impressive performance includes 16 consecutive days of bullish gains within the last month, constituting a substantial 53% of the trading period.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to acknowledge that XRP\u2019s overall trajectory has not been entirely favorable. In the context of its peers, XRP has been outperformed by the heavyweight champions of the crypto realm, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nFurthermore, its current trading position resides below the critical 200-day simple moving average at $0.49, signifying a potential challenge for sustained upward momentum.\n\nXRP 1-year price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nFrom its all-time zenith, XRP has undergone a notable descent, currently languishing at a formidable -87% decrease. This descent underscores the formidable obstacles it faces in regaining its former glory.\n\nAdding another layer of complexity to XRP\u2019s performance is the annual inflation rate, which currently stands at 15.41%. This rate may exert additional pressure on the coin\u2019s value, requiring astute navigation for investors and market participants.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin price could attempt a move to the 50% retracement level, between the $28,208 and $28,815 range.\n\nEthereum price coils up for a move north and could test the $1,650 resistance level in a 5% climb.\n\nRipple price deliberates the next move after rejection from the mean threshold at $0.5337; the odds still favor bulls.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is pushing north, but the headwinds continue to oppose the recovery rally. However, the odds still favor the upside, though only narrowly. On the other side, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) investors and traders have a lot going on with both price actions leaving longs and shorts a lot to ponder over. Generally, the market has a lot to decipher, with a quick rally in the cards, according to experts.\n\nAlso Read: Week Ahead: No ETFs, but crypto markets might be preparing for a quick rally ahead of Powell's speech\n\nBitcoin price could test the 50% Fib\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is in an overall uptrend, in what appears to be a recovery rally, with the $26,000 psychological level holding forte for the flagship crypto even as profit takers engage the load-shedding gear. Increased buying pressure above this level could send BTC north, confronting the resistance confluence between the 200- and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at around 26,933, before heading up to the 100-day EMA at $26,962.\n\nHowever, it would take more than just buying pressure to drive Bitcoin price north, considering the low volatility in the market. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moving north, momentum is growing. With such bullish interest, BTC bulls could launch a subsequent attack at the range limit presented by the EMAs before the next breakout.\n\nTraders must also put off their profit-taking appetite, with a confirmed break and close above the $27,771 likely to fuel optimism that could send BTC to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level around the $28,208 to $28,215 range.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, selling pressure from the supplier congestion zones indicated by the EMAs could extend the downtrend for Bitcoin price, with a likely retest of the $25,613 range. In the dire case, the slump could extrapolate to the $25,100 support level, last tested during mid-June. Such a move would constitute a 5% slide.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price action culls $30 million longs ahead of Fed Chairman speech\n\nEthereum price could make a move north\n\nEthereum (ETH) price appears due for a move north, supported by the promising outlook of the RSI, which is about to signal a call to buy as its edges closer to the signal line (yellow band) in the rising trajectory.\n\nTraders heeding this call could send Ethereum price north, likely to the $1,650 resistance level. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extend to the 50-day EMA at $1,672. Such a move would constitute a 5% ascent above the current level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, profit-taking could send Ethereum price back towards $1,551 or lower to collect the sell-side liquidity resting underneath.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales prepare ahead of futures Ethereum ETF approval on October 2\n\nRipple price rejected from the supply zone\n\nRipple (XRP) price was rejected from the mean threshold of the supply zone order block at $5,337. This was expected, considering the zone is characterized by aggressive selling. With the 50-, 100- and 200-day EMAs at $0.5300, 0.5468, and 0.5391, all resting within the supply zone, the bears have the advantage.\n\nHowever, the RSI is showing rising momentum, while the Parabolic SAR continues to track XRP from below, acting as support at $0.4760. These are both bullish indicators, likely to give Ethereum price the pivot for its move north.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIn the same way, the token has been recording lower highs and lower lows, indicating growing seller momentum. This could see ETH break below $0.4191 or in the dire case, send ETH below the $0.4600 to tag to mid-July.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple Price Forecast: Declining network growth and underwater XRP holders suggest more downside for XRP price"

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights XRP is experiencing a slight downward trend, possibly due to the ongoing Ripple vs. U.S. SEC legal battle.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, expressed interest in interning at Ripple in 2015, sparking speculation about his motivations.\n\nXRP traders should be aware of these past events when making investment decisions, as they could impact the price of XRP.\n\nXRP, the cryptocurrency often in the spotlight, is experiencing a slight downward trend, possibly indicating a bearish market sentiment. XRP\u2019s flat movement is primarily due to the ongoing Ripple vs. U.S. SEC legal battle, which lacks substantial updates. Additionally, there\u2019s also buzz around why Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, got engaged with XRP and Ripple back in 2015.\n\nButerin and XRP: What\u2019s the Link?\n\nThe revelation regarding Vitalik Buterin\u2019s involvement with XRP and Ripple in 2015 has garnered considerable attention. Steven Nerayoff, a former advisor to Ethereum, addressed this intriguing topic in his recent post, shedding light on the matter and dispelling lingering community speculations.\n\nNerayoff clarified that Buterin\u2019s interest in Ripple was indeed genuine, bringing transparency to what had been shrouded in mystery for years.\n\nNo idea. He told me he wanted to implement smart contracts on Bitcoin but the devs didn\u2019t want it. I spoke to him about Ripple but that was bc I had met the Ripple folks and used them as an example of how a company should be operated in this space. Ripple has been following me\u2026 \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) September 23, 2023\n\nControversy Unveiled\n\nThe story gains an interesting twist with insights from Matt Hamilton, a former director at Ripple. Hamilton disclosed that Buterin had expressed interest in interning at Ripple, going as far as staying overnight at the residence of Ripple\u2019s CTO, David Schwartz. This revelation set the crypto community abuzz, with many quick to draw conclusions.\n\nRead More: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum Transfers Hint at Potential Short Squeeze: Should You Sell Your ETH?\n\nWhile some saw this as a potential conspiracy, speculations ran rampant about what might have transpired had Vitalik Buterin continued his involvement with Ripple. Some even suggested that he could have harnessed knowledge about XRP\u2019s powerful Consensus Algorithm, potentially implementing it into Ethereum, thus strengthening its position in the blockchain arena.\n\nButerin\u2019s Multifaceted Interests\n\nSteven Nerayoff\u2019s revelations, however, paint a broader picture of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s interests. Not limited to Ripple, Buterin had once aspired to introduce smart contracts to Bitcoin, a venture met with opposition from developers. His discussions about Ripple were rooted in secret meetings with Ripple representatives, where effective operational practices in the blockchain industry were shared\u2014perhaps a joint effort to elevate the industry as a whole.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s insights ignite a debate about Buterin\u2019s true intentions during his interactions with Ripple and XRP, leaving room for genuine interest or underlying motives to be explored.\n\nListen Up, XRP Traders!\n\nWhile the past is in the past, such revelations are necessary for XRP traders to decide who is riding the SEC horse. Despite today\u2019s slight fall, XRP\u2019s price is inching towards testing the resistance level of $0.5109, despite a minor dip today. If buyers maintain their momentum, a breakout could lead to further growth around the $0.5140 mark. However, on the daily chart, XRP is still flat. It\u2019s currently trading within yesterday\u2019s levels, suggesting sideways movement in the coming days.\n\nAlso Read: Will XRP Price See a Relief Rally in October? Here\u2019s What Traders Can Expect\n\nSeveral positive factors are bolstering XRP\u2019s potential for a rebound. The prospect of a settlement in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit and statements made by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse at Mainnet 2023 have laid the groundwork for a potential XRP price recovery."
