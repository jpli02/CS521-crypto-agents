        "title": "The three Grateful Dead songs Robert Hunter wrote in one day - Far Out Magazine",
        "content": "The three classic Grateful Dead songs Robert Hunter wrote in one day\n\nRobert Hunter never had a problem following his muse when it presented itself. The Grateful Dead lyricist could adapt his writing style to a number of different genres, whether it was the playfully whimsical \u2018Ramble On Rose\u2019, the dense psychedelia of \u2018China Cat Sunflower\u2019, or the autobiographical storytelling of \u2018Truckin\u201d. Hunter experienced a major outpouring of classic material between 1969 and 1972, producing a large number of the most beloved songs in the Grateful Dead canon.\n\nIt was while visiting England for the first time in 1970 that Hunter found himself relaxing in the home of Alan Trist, one of the Dead\u2019s publishers and extended family members. Suddenly, Hunter experienced a profound onslaught of inspiration. With only a bottle of retsina wine to keep him company, Hunter went about scribbling some lyrics that wound up forming the basis for three classic Grateful Dead songs: \u2018Ripple\u2019, \u2018Brokedown Palace\u2019, and \u2018To Lay Me Down\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt was the second day I was there, and everybody went and left me alone with a case of Retsina,\u201d Hunter recalled in the Classic Albums documentary From Anthem to Beauty. \u201cI realised, here I was in London, the city I\u2019d always dreamed of going to, and I was very, very happy. I felt like I\u2019d come home to some psychic place, maybe the home of Robin Hood and Peter Pan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d only drank half a bottle of this Retsina, but it was having the whole case there that was important,\u201d Hunter added. \u201cI sat down and wrote \u2018Ripple\u2019, \u2018To Lay Me Down\u2019, and \u2018Brokedown Palace\u2019 that afternoon. It was a magic day. I knew I was writing stuff that would live forever.\u201d\n\nIn the foreword to The Complete Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics, Hunter described that particular day in more poetic terms. \u201cThe personal quintessence of the union between writer and Muse, a promising past and bright future prospects melding into one great glowing apokatastasis in South Kensington, writing words that seemed to flow like molten gold onto parchment paper,\u201d was how Hunter described the process decades later.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Jerry Garcia to take Hunter\u2019s words and make songs out of them. Both \u2018Ripple\u2019 and \u2018Brokedown Palace\u2019 would appear on American Beauty just a few months after Hunter\u2019s writing session. \u2018To Lay Me Down\u2019 made its first official appearance on Garcia\u2019s self-titled 1972 solo album but would quickly become a part of the Dead\u2019s live repertoire, having been performed more than 75 times between 1970 and 1992.\n\nCheck out \u2018Ripple\u2019, \u2018Brokedown Palace\u2019, and \u2018To Lay Me Down\u2019 below."

        "title": "When will Ripple lawsuit end and how high XRP could go? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Although Ripple has scored a monumental victory in the blockchain company\u2019s legal standoff with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that the XRP token was not a security, the XRP community still awaits the final judgment before it can move away from the lawsuit.\n\nSpecifically, as the court found, Ripple Labs did not violate federal securities law by selling its XRP token to retail investors on public cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the SEC did score a partial win for itself, as the judge ruled that the XRP sales to sophisticated investors did, in fact, constitute securities sales.\n\nOne potential outcome of the final judgment is that both parties reach an agreement and settle the case. In a different scenario, in which the parties fail to reach a settlement, the case could go to trial. On the other hand, either party appealing the case is a possibility as well.\n\nUntil presidential election?\n\nIn particular, legal experts stand divided on the regulator\u2019s next course of action \u2013 whether the SEC would appeal Judge Torres\u2019s decision and try to reverse the conclusion that XRP is not a security or settle with Ripple and turn to a different front from which it could attack the crypto industry, such as the crypto trading platform Coinbase.\n\nIf the SEC pursues an appeal under the direction of chief Gary Gensler, it could suffer an even worse loss, including in terms of finances, and Ripple could drag the initial appeal out until the next presidential election or beyond, after which Gensler would likely be gone, as the higher courts prefer not to rule on issues partially, and typically wait until there is a final judgment.\n\nFurthermore, as legal expert Jeremy Hogan argues:\n\n\u201cIf [the SEC] wins the appeal, it pulls back some adverse trial-level case. But if it LOSES at the appellate level, now every Court in the 2nd [District Court of Appeal (DCA)] MUST follow the decision. They could literally turn a mole-hill into a mountain.\u201d\n\nIndeed, should the regulations watchdog realize this is not worth its efforts, it might decide to settle, in which case the XRP community could put the whole ordeal behind it much sooner. Either way, a favorable outcome for Ripple would mean an increase in the price of XRP, as it happened following Judge Torres\u2019s decision.\n\nXRP price predictions\n\nAt press time, XRP was changing hands at the price of $0.714, increasing 0.21% in the last 24 hours, recording a 7.77% decline across the previous seven days, and capturing a significant gain of 51.09% on its monthly chart, according to the recent information retrieved on July 28.\n\nXRP 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, Google\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) tool Bard has listed several potential price predictions for XRP after Ripple\u2019s legal triumph, including reaching an average price of $1.30 by the end of 2023, as well as more conservative predictions of $0.47 or $0.71 by the year\u2019s turn.\n\nBy comparison, the machine learning algorithm deployed by the crypto forecast platform PricePredictions projected XRP to trade at $0.71 at the end of August 2023, suggesting a slight downswing over the next 30 days. Earlier, crypto analyst CoinsKid shared an opinion that XRP could hit the $6 price by the end of 2023.\n\nMore recently, crypto market expert Cryptoinsightsuk listed five potential price outcomes for the XRP token post-SEC case, including a mini bull run to $10-$15, a similar smaller pump, a further pump to $20-$30, a complete moon mission, or double tapping the highs of 2017 and reaching $3.30-$3.60, as Finbold reported on July 21.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "'A Strong Ripple Effect': Career Center's Janet Rakes Leaves Legacy of Service - Poole College of Management",
        "content": "After 15 years with the Poole College of Management, Janet Rakes plans to pay it forward in retirement, continuing to serve students in need.\n\nBy Jess Clarke\n\nJanet Rakes\u2019 passion is helping students to find theirs \u2014 about 10,000 of them in the past 15 years, in fact.\n\nAfter she retires August 1, Rakes, an assistant director at the Poole College of Management Career Center, will pursue her own keen interests. And one of them will be continuing to work with undergraduates, but as a volunteer.\n\nWhy? Because the mission-focused grandmother wants to address a growing need: helping students struggling with debt and prone to food and housing insecurity.\n\n\u201cMore than any other place I\u2019ve ever worked, Poole College and my outstanding career team have allowed me the time and resources to help students and really make a difference in their lives. That\u2019s why I stayed,\u201d Rakes says.\n\nThe difference she\u2019s made in students\u2019 lives has a potential multigenerational influence on career success and financial independence.\n\nMore than any other place I\u2019ve ever worked, Poole College and my outstanding career team have allowed me the time and resources to help students and really make a difference in their lives.\n\n\u201cMy aim, and the aim of our career team, is to help every student find a career they\u2019ll really enjoy,\u201d Rakes says, \u201cand to find financial security, so they and their children and their children\u2019s children will never know financial hardship.\n\n\u201cOnce these students have children, they can teach their children how to teach their children how to find a satisfying career. Providing students with effective career guidance has a very long-range impact.\u201d\n\nIn matching students with careers, Rakes asks: How would they want to spend their life if money didn\u2019t matter? When they have an answer, \u201cThen I have a target, and I try to help them get as close as possible to what they most want to do and still be practical and take into account family obligations and their skills,\u201d she says.\n\nRakes\u2019 guidance, and that of her Career Center colleagues, has yielded promising results.\n\nBased on career surveys NC State sends to graduates, \u201cPoole students do very well. Year after year, they\u2019ve indicated they\u2019re satisfied or very satisfied with the career they\u2019re going into,\u201d Rakes says.\n\nA survey from May 2022 showed the average salary for new Poole graduates was over $63,000. \u201cIf we\u2019re achieving that level of financial security,\u201d she notes, \u201cwe\u2019re achieving what we wanted to achieve.\u201d\n\nAnother achievement for the career center team was recent Poole approval for a career readiness course (M120) the team developed. The course is required for transfer students and an elective for others. She calls that a big breakthrough in providing crucial career information to undergraduates.\n\nRakes (second from right) with the Poole College Career Center team.\n\nRakes\u2019 role in initiatives for student well-being is one reason she received an NC State Award for Excellence for customer service this spring. The award nomination cites a clothes closet service she helped launch for Poole students to access professional attire and her efforts to address food insecurity.\n\nFood and housing insecurity among college students nationally is a trend Rakes has noted over the years.\n\nThe 2008 Great Recession marked her start at the Career Center. Since then, employers increasingly have wanted new hires to have career-related experience from hands-on opportunities in college. The importance of GPAs generally has decreased in the past few years as work experience has become more crucial.\n\n\u201cEmployers realize when they get interns and they turn into full-time hires, those with higher GPAs aren\u2019t necessarily performing better. It\u2019s the work they\u2019ve done in an internship that\u2019s a better predictor of success once they\u2019re full-time in the job,\u201d Rakes says.\n\nAs a result, many Poole seniors have jobs waiting after graduation \u2014 before they start their senior year \u2014 usually because of internships.\n\nIf you make positive change in your own little world, it can have a strong ripple effect.\u201d\n\nAnother national trend is high student debt. Rakes is concerned about students dropping out because of debt, and the food and housing insecurity debt can drive. Some students end up without a degree in a job that doesn\u2019t require a college education. That leaves them worse off financially than when they started college.\n\nLast fall, she initiated a first-generation career support group and employer mentor program. She met with students weekly to discuss resumes, interviewing, salary negotiation and related topics, and connected them with industry mentors.\n\n\u201cIf you could take what our career team has achieved and implement these strategies and programs as soon as students arrive at college, I can\u2019t imagine the impact it could have on the entire economy. We have developed a little microcosm that works,\u201d Rakes says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I went into career services and why I love it \u2014 because of the potential it has to make such a positive impact on the whole country.\u201d\n\nRakes holding one of her grandchildren.\n\nIn retirement, she looks forward to spending more time with her grandchildren, traveling and tutoring children in a Latinx community her church supports. She\u2019ll also continue working with first-generation Poole students and volunteering at the Pack Essentials hub.\n\nRakes will follow her own advice for students: \u201cWhen you\u2019re given a choice, choose to go the extra mile because usually you\u2019ll be glad you did as you think back over your life,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you make positive change in your own little world, it can have a strong ripple effect.\u201d"

        "title": "United States: Court rules that XRP by itself is not a security - GlobalComplianceNews",
        "content": "In brief\n\nOn July 13, 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York issued an Order on competing motions for summary judgment in the closely followed SEC v. Ripple Labs, Inc. litigation. As the first court decision to broadly address the question of whether a cryptocurrency itself is a security, as the SEC has maintained in most circumstances, the Order may have broad implications to the state of crypto industry regulation in the US.\n\nContents\n\nAt a high level, the Order contains five key holdings:\n\nXRP, as a digital asset, is not in and of itself an investment contract.\n\nSelling any asset (including a digital asset) via an investment contract does not automatically make the subject asset a security.\n\nAn arrangement by Ripple to sell XRP directly to institutional investors pursuant to written agreements (\u201c Institutional Sales \u201c) is an investment contract.\n\n\u201c) is an investment contract. An arrangement by Ripple to sell XRP \u201cprogrammatically\u201d or through trading algorithms anonymously to the public via crypto exchanges (\u201c Programmatic Sales \u201c) is not an investment contract.\n\n\u201c) is not an investment contract. An arrangement by Ripple to distribute XRP as a form of payment for services (e.g., employee compensation) (\u201c Other Distributions \u201c) is not an investment contract.\n\n\u201c) is not an investment contract. In this Alert, we provide an overview of the key holdings and share some insights on its potential implications to the state of crypto regulation in the US.\n\nBackground\n\nIn this case, Judge Torres was called upon to determine whether or not Ripple engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201c) in connection with its XRP transactions, as alleged by the SEC. The court was obliged to evaluate the transaction under SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 US 293 (1946), the leading precedent under which the US Supreme Court set forth a test for determining how to identify a security. The Howey test generally provides that an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d is a \u201ccontract, scheme or transaction\u201d whereby a person (1) invests money (2) in a common enterprise and (3) is led to expect profits from the essential managerial efforts of others which affect the success or failure of the enterprise. If the contract, scheme or transaction is an investment contract, it is a security and will be governed accordingly under a panoply of the federal and state securities laws.\n\nThere has been little debate in recent years that an initial coin offering or other forms of selling digital asset tokens in an initial distribution constitutes an investment contract and therefore a securities offering. However, through consent orders, recent complaints, and informal statements, the SEC has clouded the long understood distinction between investment contracts (a security) and the underlying assets sold pursuant to them.\n\nIn speeches and interviews, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly taken the view that the \u201cvast majority [of digital asset tokens] are securities.\u201d Similarly, as highlighted in a prior alert, the SEC\u2019s recent enforcement actions against crypto exchanges effectively argue that once a digital asset token is sold via an investment contract, the token somehow becomes an investment contract itself.\n\nIn those complaints, the SEC attempts to tie the initial offering of a token and continued participation of its founders and issuing organizations to the secondary trading of such tokens on crypto trading platforms as an ongoing investment scheme under Howey.\n\nHowever, as noted in the Securities Clarity Act, a bi-partisan bill reintroduced a few weeks ago, these statements and claims conflate the long settled distinction between an investment contract (a security) and the underlying assets sold pursuant to the investment contract, which may or may not be a security. This distinction also was reflected in the now infamous 2018 speech by former Director of the SEC Division of Corporate Finance, William Hinman \u2014 Digital Asset Transactions: When Howey Met Gary (Plastic). Still, somewhere in between, the Chair Gensler and the SEC determined to test that distinction.\n\nOrange groves are not securities and neither is XRP: Back to Howey basics\n\nWhile the Ripple decision contains other important holdings, for the sake of Howey and the crypto industry, perhaps no holding was as important as returning to the basics: that is, the purpose of the Howey test and the distinction between an investment contract and its subject asset. In assessing the XRP token, Judge Torres recognized that any asset can be the subject of an investment contract, but selling any asset (including a digital asset) via an investment contract does not automatically make that subject asset into a security. Rather, whether the sale and distribution of XRP, orange groves, or any other asset (a non-security) constitutes an investment contract (a security) depends on the totality of the circumstances surrounding each contract, transaction, or scheme through which the asset is sold and distributed (i.e., a transaction-by-transaction analysis).\n\nWhen looking at XRP, Judge Torres was unequivocal in holding that XRP, the digital asset by itself, is not \u201ca \u2018contract, transaction, or scheme\u2019 that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract,\u201d and thus it is not a security. In that sense, XRP, the digital asset, is no different than the orange groves in Howey. In Howey, investors purchased ownership interests in parcels of orange groves coupled with a service agreement for another person to cultivate, harvest and market the crops and remit the net proceeds to the passive investors. It was the entirety of that arrangement that constituted the investment contract in Howey, not the orange groves themselves.\n\nRe-establishing the basic Howey analysis framework may be the most important outcome of the Order, and arguably one less likely to be overturned on appeal. Moreover, the Securities Clarity Act and the recently introduced Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act would further reinforce the distinction between the investment contract and the underlying asset. Indeed, the connection was immediately highlighted by Rep. Emmers in reaction to the Order.\n\nInstitutional Sales vs. Programmatic Sales\n\nApplying the Howey transaction-by-transaction analysis, in the Order, Judge Torres assessed each of the Institutional Sales, Programmatic Sales, and Other Distributions based on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding each contract, transaction or scheme. Of the three contracts, transactions or schemes involving XRP assessed by the court, only the Institutional Sales were found to meet all of the Howey elements. The court found that both the Programmatic Sales and Other Distributions failed to meet at least one Howey element, and thus were not investment contracts.\n\nThe court\u2019s divergent conclusions on Institutional and Programmatic Sales stems from the analysis of the third prong of the Howey analysis. With respect to Institutional Sales, Judge Torres quickly dispensed with the first two Howey prongs, finding they were easily met. Because the court found the third prong was not met for Programmatic Sales, discussion of the first two prongs was unnecessary. When assessing the third prong, the court recognized that buyers in both types of sales had or could have had an expectation of profits in purchasing XRP. Thus, the crucial question for Judge Torres was whether that expectation was derived from the efforts of Ripple.\n\nThe court found that Institutional Buyers derived their expectation of profits from the efforts of Ripple, but that Programmatic Buyers did not. To reach this conclusion, the court identified several differences, but the key distinction was buyers\u2019 knowledge of whether Ripple was on the other side of the transaction.\n\nIn particular, Institutional Buyers entered into contracts with Ripple and purchased XRP directly from Ripple. As a result, they knew that Ripple was the seller and Ripple knew the buyer. In contrast, Programmatic Buyers had no contract directly with Ripple and purchased XRP through blind bid/ask transactions on a secondary exchange. As a result, Programmatic Buyers could not have known whether Ripple was the seller, and Ripple could not have known the buyer. As noted in the Order, these Programmatic Buyers largely \u201cdid not invest their money in Ripple at all.\u201d The court also noted evidence that some of these Programmatic Buyers who purchased XRP were wholly unaware of Ripple.\n\nAdditionally, the court also looked at the sophistication of the different types of buyers in determining whether a reasonable, similarly situated person would have connected XRP\u2019s price to Ripple\u2019s efforts. In this regard, unlike the Institutional Buyers, the court found the evidence lacking that a reasonable person in the shoes of the \u201cgenerally less sophisticated\u201d Programmatic Buyers could have analyzed the various documents and statements published by Ripple and its personnel over an extended period of time and connected those efforts by Ripple to XRP\u2019s price.\n\nAs a result, having considered the economic reality and totality of the circumstances, although Judge Torres held Ripple\u2019s Institutional Sales constituted an unregistered offer and sale of securities, Ripple\u2019s Programmatic Sales did not.\n\nOther Distributions\n\nThe court took little time in finding that Ripple\u2019s Other Distributions did not involve an investment of money and thus failed the first prong of the Howey test. In each distribution cited, Judge Torres noted that it was Ripple who gave up something of value (XRP) and not the recipients. The recipients paid no money, cash or other tangible and definable consideration to Ripple in exchange for the XRP they received.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nCongressional action more likely\n\nAlthough the Ripple decision is likely to be appealed, it stands to complicate the SEC\u2019s other ongoing litigation matters in this area while supporting pending Congressional action. Indeed, arguments that crypto regulation in the US must be resolved by Congress and not administrative action have only been bolstered by the Order; and the FIT for the 21st Century Act and other legislative activity may find more support than previously thought. Still, converting expectations of legislation into law may require significant bi-partisan support to avoid a veto threats from the Biden administration, which has shown little receptiveness to the industry.\n\nImpact to ongoing SEC litigation\n\nAs briefly noted above, the Order cuts directly at the heart of the SEC\u2019s legal arguments in its ongoing litigation matters against crypto exchanges, and one of those cases also happens to be in the SDNY, where Judge Torres\u2019s Order will carry more legal weight. The Order is undoubtedly a new litigation risk for the SEC\u2019s ongoing and planned enforcement activity. How it may impact the current cases or the SEC\u2019s crypto crackdown remains to be seen.\n\nCrypto exchanges and trading platforms\n\nThe question of whether secondary market sales of XRP constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts was not properly before the court and thus was not directly addressed. Nonetheless, in footnote 16, the court reiterated that such a question must be assessed under the transaction-by-transaction Howey analysis. As a result, the court reinforced the framework for exchanges to assess their digital asset listing process: (1) assessing each digital asset to determine whether it constitutes an investment contract or some other security by itself, and (2) if not, whether the manner in which the exchange makes the digital asset available for sale on its platform constitutes an investment contract.\n\nFirms should consider how the Order may impact their listing standards, and trading and promotional activities. Of note, US crypto exchanges generally take the position that merely making digital asset tokens available for trading on their platforms, without more, is not the offer and sale of securities. As a result, the Ripple Order was enough to prompt many US crypto exchanges to begin relisting XRP on their platforms."
