        "content": "Montenegro has joined dozens of nations around the world in pursuing a digital currency.\n\nThe Central Bank of Montenegro (CBCG) is working with cryptocurrency and blockchain firm Ripple to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to a Tuesday (April 11) press release.\n\n\u201cThrough the project, the CBCG will work with the government of Montenegro and Montenegro\u2019s academia to create a practical digital currency or secure currency solution to test the main blockchain technology\u2019s functionality and potential,\u201d the bank\u2019s governor, Radoje \u017dugi\u0107, said in the release. \u201cIt will also analyze the advantages and risks that CBDCs or national stablecoins could pose concerning electronic means of payment availability, security, efficiency, compliance with regulations, and most importantly, the protection of end users\u2019 rights and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe project will go through a series of stages, including determining the practical application of a digital currency and the design to simulate its circulation and use in controlled conditions, per the release.\n\nThe hope is to develop a \u201cCBDC for many use cases including widening financial inclusion, modernizing monetary policy, improving payment security and increasing cross-border payments efficiency,\u201d the release stated.\n\nThe Ripple/CBCG partnership is happening amid a wave of CBDC activity. For example, the Digital Currency Monetary Authority unveiled Monday (April 10) a digital coin known as Universal Monetary Unit (UMU) and designed to speed cross-border transactions.\n\nUMU is \u201clegally a money commodity, can transact in any legal tender settlement currency, and functions like a CBDC to enforce banking regulations and to protect the financial integrity of the international banking system,\u201d the DCMA said in a news release.\n\nAccording to the release, banks can attach SWIFT codes and bank accounts to a UMU digital currency wallet and transact \u201cSWIFT-like cross-border payments over digital currency rails.\u201d\n\nAlso this week, the Bank of England has begun hiring workers to help launch its CBDC. The career section of the central bank\u2019s website includes listings for a \u201cdigital pound solutions architect\u201d and \u201cdigital pound security architect,\u201d both added at the end of March.\n\nAlthough the United Kingdom has left the European Union, it\u2019s still one of 29 countries using the EU\u2019s SEPA Instant Credit Transfer real-time payments scheme, which lets consumers clear cashless payments in seconds across the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).\n\nThat\u2019s why the U.K. government will have to make a strong case for a digital pound, especially when access to instant payments is already part of consumers\u2019 everyday lives, Martin Hargreaves, chief product officer at Quant, told PYMNTS earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the real challenge for those designing the CBDC, which is to come up with something compelling enough that will interest consumers enough to open a CBDC account and actually use it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor all PYMNTS Crypto and EMEA coverage, subscribe to the daily Crypto and EMEA Newsletters."

        "title": "As rising temperatures affect Alaskan rivers, effects ripple through Indigenous communities - University of Colorado Boulder",
        "content": "Banner image: Small rivers draining the Brooks Range in Gates of the Arctic National Park, Alaska. (Credit: Josh Koch)\n\nStreamflow is increasing in Alaskan rivers during both spring and fall seasons, primarily due to increasing air temperatures over the past 60 years, according to new CU Boulder-led research.\n\nThis increased volume of free-flowing water during the shoulder seasons is compounded by earlier snowmelt and thawing permafrost, also driven by increasing temperatures; all of which are affecting the formation and safety of Alaska river ice in winter, and the timing of when rivers \u201cbreak up\u201d in response to seasonal warming each spring.\n\nThe findings are the result of a collaboration between researchers at CU Boulder, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Park Service, who analyzed data from 1960 to 2019 for nine major river basins in Alaska. Their results, published in February in Environmental Research Letters, show how rivers can serve as a measurable quantity for understanding the cumulative impacts of climate change in Arctic regions.\n\n\u201cMeasuring rivers is useful because it integrates all these other changes in temperature, precipitation, permafrost and snow cover. All the dynamics that feed the hydrologic cycle eventually get filtered into the amount of water in a river,\u201d said Dylan Blaskey, lead author on the study and doctoral student in civil engineering.\n\n\n\nTop: Ice-rich permafrost bluffs on the bank of the Canning River, Alaska.

(Credit: Michael Gooseff)\n\nThis scientific work quantifies the consequences already observed and experienced for generations by local Indigenous communities who rely on these rivers for their livelihoods. They face not only cultural and financial losses from less dependable winter river ice but heightened danger when using these rivers for transportation and fishing.\n\nAhead of the study\u2019s publication, the CU-led research group hosted the Arctic Rivers Summit in Anchorage late last year. The gathering of Indigenous leaders and community representatives, government officials and scientists met to discuss these and other pressing issues facing Alaska and other Arctic communities. At the Summit, the team learned more about regional and local concerns and observations. The outcome is intended to help the researchers tailor and improve the delivery of scientific data to create information and products that are usable for Indigenous communities faced with planning for an uncertain future.\n\n\u201cWe're using these river gages to monitor these remote areas, but there are many people who have a much more intimate and holistic knowledge of the landscape and how it's changing,\u201d said Blaskey. \u201cAt the Summit, it became clear that we were converging on an understanding of how climate change is affecting Indigenous communities and Arctic ecosystems.\u201d\n\nStrides in streamflow\n\nRiver gages are small pieces of equipment that monitor a river\u2019s stream flow by measuring the amount of water that passes over it in a set period of time, usually each second. In comparison to the Lower 48, there are very few river gages in Alaska, said CU Boulder co-author Keith Musselman, assistant professor at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at CU Boulder.\n\nThe researchers analyzed six decades\u2019 worth of monthly data from river gages in nine Alaskan rivers, comparing streamflow to air temperature, soil temperature, soil moisture and precipitation across the basins. They also accounted for large scale climate anomalies, such as El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a.\n\nStreamflow in Alaskan rivers typically peaks in summer, and remains quite low in winter, with stark transitions between the two seasons. The study found that while the amount of water flowing through these rivers on a yearly basis is not changing, when it flows through them is shifting, with more water freely flowing from October through April\u2014creating more gradual seasonal transitions.\n\nChanges in air temperature have had the biggest impact on streamflow in these Alaskan rivers. The average days above freezing in April and October have increased by about a day every decade, according to Blaskey. These months are also when average monthly streamflow has increased the most: by 15% per decade in April and 7% per decade in October.\n\nThey also found that the correlation of increased streamflow with temperature is only getting stronger over time when data from the first 30 years (1960\u20131989) are compared to the most recent 30-year period (1990\u20132019).\n\nSince the 1960s, winter air temperatures have increased by 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) on average across the global Arctic. The findings from Alaskan river gages help quantify the disproportionate impacts that climate change is having on the planet\u2019s northernmost ecosystems.\n\n\u201cOne of the opportunities and challenges of researching in Alaska is that signals of climate change have already begun to appear,\u201d said Blaskey.\n\nGroup photo from Arctic Rivers Summit held in Anchorage in December of 2022. (Credit: Keith Musselman)\n\nRipple effects in community\n\nIndigenous communities use rivers for vital transportation and sustenance, whether frozen in ice or as free-flowing water. Many rivers are part of traditional hunting and fishing routes, which can be traveled over when they are frozen. Rivers also serve as essential thoroughfares to connect communities and to bring in seasonal supplies, such as fuel and food, because road networks are limited in Alaska.\n\nAs the seasons shift, ice freezes later and breaks up earlier, undermining the stability and safety of river ice.\n\n\u201cThe shrinking of the fall and spring seasons affects how long river ice persists and is safe to travel over. Indigenous communities have suffered an increasing number of fatalities over the last few decades,\u201d said Musselman. \u201cIt seemed that everyone at the workshop had stories of someone who had fallen in the ice and lost their life.\u201d\n\nThese and other timely concerns were shared at the Arctic Rivers Summit in December. Hosting this meeting was also another chance for Blaskey and his fellow researchers to listen to the communities most affected by the changes they\u2019re studying, in addition to regularly working with an Indigenous advisory council who has helped guide their work since the inception of the project.\n\n\u201cDocumenting the long-term changes in streamflow is a way for us to quantify and share what's happening in the rivers,\u201d said Blaskey. \u201cIndigenous communities already know what\u2019s happening to the rivers.\u201d\n\nTogether, Indigenous knowledge and long-term monitoring can help to develop narratives of change across the Arctic landscape to support planning and community adaptation, said Musselman.\n\nAdditional authors on this publication include: Joshua Koch, United States Geological Survey; Michael Gooseff, University of Colorado Boulder; Andrew Newman and Yifan Cheng, National Center for Atmospheric Research; and Jonathan O\u2019Donnell, National Park Service, Arctic Network. This study is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Navigating the New Arctic program."
