        "title": "Harnessing the Power of XRP: Unveiling the Benefits of Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Ripple\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service may not be a newcomer to the FinTech landscape, but it continues to solidify its position as an innovative game-changer in the realm of cross-border transactions. This compelling solution, powered by the digital asset XRP, holds the potential to redefine traditional financial paradigms, particularly when it comes to cost efficiency and speed.\n\nCross-border transactions have long been a source of friction in global finance. The conventional processes involve pre-funded local currency accounts and are often burdened with high costs and time-consuming procedures. Enter ODL \u2014 Ripple\u2019s solution that has been quietly transforming this landscape for several years.\n\nUsing XRP as a bridge currency, ODL enables financial institutions to transfer funds across borders instantly, reliably, and cost-effectively. It bypasses the need for pre-funding and leverages the speed and efficiency of XRP, which can be moved in mere seconds. This unique approach presents a wealth of benefits that are hard to ignore.\n\nCost Efficiency\n\nOne of the standout advantages of ODL is its potential for significant cost savings. By eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts in destination currencies, ODL dramatically reduces the operational costs associated with foreign exchange. This can translate into substantial savings for financial institutions, and by extension, for their customers.\n\nUnparalleled Speed\n\nIn the world of finance, speed can often be the difference between success and failure. Traditional methods of transferring money across borders are notoriously slow, sometimes taking several days to complete. ODL, however, takes full advantage of the high-speed settlement capability of XRP, enabling transactions to be completed in seconds. This level of speed can bring about a sea change in how businesses handle international transactions.\n\nDespite being in the field for a few years, ODL seems to be an underappreciated gem in the expansive world of cryptocurrencies. Its potential to eliminate long-standing bottlenecks in the cross-border transaction process can have ripple effects (pun intended) across the global financial landscape.\n\nImproved Liquidity and Expanded Reach\n\nBy providing on-demand liquidity, ODL enables businesses to free up capital tied in foreign bank accounts, thereby improving their liquidity. This benefit, coupled with the service\u2019s cost-effectiveness and speed, allows financial institutions to expand their services to new markets that may have been previously inaccessible due to financial constraints and inefficiencies.\n\nTraceability and Scalability\n\nWith blockchain technology at its heart, ODL ensures every transaction is traceable, secure, and transparent. This feature adds another layer of trust to the service, a crucial factor in the financial industry. Additionally, ODL\u2019s scalability allows it to handle substantial transaction volumes simultaneously, making it a suitable solution for financial institutions of all sizes.\n\nDespite these compelling benefits, Ripple\u2019s ODL still appears to be flying somewhat under the radar for many cryptocurrency enthusiasts. It\u2019s high time this solution receives recognition for its potential to revolutionize cross-border transactions."

        "title": "Mutual destruction: Binary stars, black holes, and ripples in space-time - New Atlas",
        "content": "Researchers from University College London and the University of Potsdam, Germany have studied two most massive touching stars in a neighboring galaxy that will eventually turn into black holes and collide, sending ripples through space and time.\n\nThe black holes we observe today were formed billions of years ago when there were lower levels of iron and other heavy elements floating around the universe. As the universe aged, the levels of these elements have increased, making the phenomenon of merging black holes less common.\n\nThe stars, which orbit around a shared center of gravity and together are known as a binary star, are in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a mere 210,000 light-years away from our Milky Way galaxy. The stars orbit one another every three days and are the biggest touching stars (contact binaries) ever observed. But it\u2019s their mutually destructive relationship that piqued the interest of the researchers.\n\nUsing long-term data collected by NASA\u2019s Hubble Telescope and the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the European Southern Observatory\u2019s (ESO\u2019s) Very Large Telescope in Chile, as well as other telescopes, the researchers measured different bands of light coming from the binary star (spectroscopic analysis). They found that most of the outer envelope of the smaller star had been stripped away by the larger one.\n\n\u201cThis binary star is the most massive contact binary observed so far,\u201d said Daniel Pauli, co-author of the study. \u201cThe smaller, brighter, hotter star, 32 times the mass of the Sun, is currently losing mass to its bigger companion, which has 55 times our Sun\u2019s mass.\u201d\n\nIn the scheme of astronomical evolution, it won\u2019t take long before the small star becomes a black hole and the star\u2019s role will be reversed, according to the researchers.\n\n\u201cThe smaller star will become a black hole first, in as little as 700,000 years, either through a spectacular explosion called a supernova or it may be so massive as to collapse into a black hole with no outward explosion,\u201d said Matthew Rickard, lead author of the study. \u201cThey will be uneasy neighbors for around three million years before the first black hole starts accreting mass from its companion, taking revenge on its companion.\u201d\n\nTheir findings were backed up by comparing gravitational wave observations from the Virgo interferometer and LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, with theoretical models of the evolution of binary stars.\n\n\u201cThanks to gravitational wave detectors Virgo and LIGO, dozens of black hole mergers have been detected in the last few years,\u201d Rickard said. \u201cBut so far, we have yet to observe stars that are predicted to collapse into black holes of this size and merge in a time scale shorter than or even broadly comparable to the age of the universe.\u201d\n\nGravitational waves are invisible \u2018ripples\u2019 in time and space caused by the universe\u2019s most violent and energetic processes. The strongest gravitational waves are produced by cataclysmic events like colliding black holes, which would disrupt space-time in such a way as to send out cosmic ripples, traveling in all directions at the speed of light. These ripples carry information about their origins.\n\n\u201cAfter only 200,000 years, an instant in astronomical terms, the companion star will collapse into a black hole as well,\u201d Pauli said. \u201cThese two massive stars will continue to orbit each other, going round and round every few days for billions of years.\u201d\n\nAccording to the study\u2019s findings, we have some time before the black holes collide. But when they do, it will generate gravitational waves that may be detectable on Earth.\n\n\u201cSlowly they will lose this orbital energy through the emission of gravitational waves until they orbit each other every few seconds, finally merging together in 18 billion years with a huge release of energy through gravitational waves,\u201d Pauli said.\n\nHaving stars like these so close to our own galaxy has enabled researchers to further our knowledge of the universe.\n\n\u201cFinding stars on this evolutionary pathway so close to our Milky Way galaxy presents us with an excellent opportunity to learn even more about how these black hole binaries form,\" Rickard added.\n\nThe study has been accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nSource: University College London"

        "title": "Waves of concern continue to ripple across the global banking sector, writes David Buik - LBC",
        "content": "Waves of concern continue to ripple across the global banking sector, writes David Buik\n\nWaves of concern continue to ripple across the global banking sector, writes David Buik. Picture: LBC\n\nBy David Buik\n\nOn Friday 14th April and Tuesday 18th April, there was a slew of great US bank earnings, including JP Morgan, Citibank, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America.\n\nListen to this article Loading audio...\n\nAfter the crisis created by SVB Bank, First Republic Bank of California, and Signature Bank and even more worryingly from the demise of Credit Suisse, which caused bondholders to lose circa $17 billion, the quality of these earnings came as a bit of a welcome surprise.\n\nWhat market observers may well have not taken into consideration, was the aggressive stance taken by the FED in the last year. Rates had risen from 0.25% to 4.5%.\n\nThis action created an environment for banks to increase their income for the last quarter by between 23% and 50% - unprecedented in recent years. Of course, markets have enjoyed lower interest rates for nearly 15 years since the banking crisis of 2008/9 \u2013 hence the misjudgement by market observers and analysts.\n\nApart from Wells Fargo, these banking shares bounced quite sharply by between 4% and 7% in response to the unexpected strength of these results, before easing back. It is interesting to note that First Republic Bank of California announced it had suffered $100bn of customer withdrawals between January and March, sparking concerns about its financial health.\n\nIts shares have fallen 79% in two days, sending ripples of concern through the US banking regulators.\n\nDavid Buik & Michael Wilson, two of the most respected commentators in the world of Money and Business come together for a weekly podcast exclusively on Global Player\u2013 Money!\n\nListen to Money with David Buik and Michael Wilson only on Global Player. Picture: LBC\n\nHowever, these earnings were hardly Utopian. Provisions for bad debts were measurable \u2013 JP Morgan $2.3bn, Citibank $2.4bn, Wells Fargo $1.21bn and Bank of America $931 million respectively. It then became clear that on Monday 17th April 2023, State Street Bank, Charles Schwab, and Northern Trust had surrendered $60 billion of deposits since the SVB/Credit Suisse \u2018faux pas.\u2019\n\nState Street shares fell by 18%, ending Monday session down 11%. Technology and social media now move faster than the speed of lightning, allowing a gargantuan level of deposits to see alternative accommodation elsewhere, in a heartbeat! Banks have received a real wake-up call, as have regulators, due to the damage caused by uncertainty.\n\nThe volatility of a bank\u2019s deposit base could well continue to cause measurable damage to the stability of the international banking sector.\n\nA continuing negative factor that could manifest itself from this anomaly, could be that banks may become reluctant to lend money, by tightening their belts. This could stifle growth and lead to a modest recession in the next year.\n\nListen to LBC on Global Player: Podcasts, news and radio highlights. Picture: Global Player\n\nAs for the investment banking community, Goldman Sachs did not exactly cover themselves in glory.\n\nProfits fell 18% thanks to weaker bond trading than expected and a dearth of corporate finance opportunities. A loss of $470m was incurred on \u2018Marcus\u2019 loans.\n\nMorgan Stanley fared slightly better, with first-quarter forecasts topping estimates from better-than-expected trading results with revenues of $14.52 billion, though profits fell 19% to $2.98 billion.\n\nIn years gone by, Europe\u2019s banking sector was always considered a jewel in its crown \u2013 with UBS, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank very much in the vanguard - Sadly, this is not entirely the case today.\n\nThere is little point in dwelling on Credit Suisse\u2019s plight. Suffice to say they fell fortunately into the attentive arms of UBS. It is worth recording that in the last quarter of 2022, Credit Suisse lost CHF 110 billion of deposits and CHF 61 billion in the first quarter of 2023!\n\nThis seismic movement illustrates very succinctly how neurotically sensitive deposit customers are to the advent of instability. In the last quarter, UBS increased its provisions of $665 million associated with residential mortgage-backed securities litigation issues.\n\nThe Swiss banking mogul also attracted $28 billion in net new money into its global wealth management unit. Notwithstanding that news, UBS reported a 52% annual drop in net profit to $1.03 billion.\n\nSergio Ermotti, UBS\u2019s distinguished CEO has not underestimated the magnitude of the task of bedding down Credit Suisse into UBS\u2019s operations.\n\nOne suspects there will be solid support from the Swiss Central Bank. However, the threat of litigation may play more than a spear-carrying role in their adventure.\n\nSantander has performed splendidly this year, with its shares rallying by 14% this year. It might have been more, but for the imposition of a \u20ac224m windfall tax. Profits were down to \u20ac2.57 billion.\n\nEarnings from Deutsche Bank this Thursday offered hope. It posted a pre-tax profit for the first quarter of \u20ac1.9 billion \u2013 up 12% on net inflows of \u20ac7.7 billion \u2013 up 5%.\n\nTrading revenue was down 17%. Tier One Capital came in at a decent 13.6%. Provisions for bad debt came in at \u20ac372 million.\n\nThese are decent numbers, but investors still need convincing that Deutsche\u2019s shares are on the march. Since 2007, just before the banking crisis, Germany\u2019s premier bank\u2019s shares stood at \u20ac93.\n\nToday\u2019s share price is \u20ac9.56, despite copious rights issues over the years. Deutsche Bank has never really recovered from what the market perceives to have been dramatic over-involvement in derivative trading \u2013 at the time probably the largest in the world. Disengaging from large positions has proved challenging and the recovery process has been painful.\n\nI will post news on UK bank earnings next week. It will be interesting to draw comparisons with their European/US peers.\n\nWhat concerns most market observers is whilst these ripples of concern prevail over the brittleness of the banking sector, lending may contract, thus stifling growth prospects across the world."

        "title": "Q1 2023 XRP Markets Report - Ripple",
        "content": "Ripple publishes the quarterly XRP Markets Report to voluntarily provide transparency and regular updates on the company\u2019s views on the state of crypto markets, including its quarterly XRP sales, relevant XRP Ledger and XRP-related announcements, and commentary on market developments over the previous quarter.\n\nAs an XRP holder, Ripple believes proactive communication and transparency are part of being a responsible stakeholder. Moreover, Ripple urges others in the industry to build trust, foster open communication and raise the bar industry-wide.\n\nNotable Takeaways\n\nTotal XRP sales by Ripple in Q1 2023, net of purchases, were $361.06M v. $226.31M the previous quarter.\n\nXRP Ledger on-chain activity remained strong, with decentralized exchange volumes increasing 34% to $115M in Q1 2023 versus Q4 2022. XRP Average Daily Volume (ADV) on centralized exchanges jumped 46% in Q1 to $1B from $698M.\n\nThe EU, UK and UAE proposed new regulatory regimes for crypto focused on licensing and activity-based frameworks.\n\nDevelopers proposed a new interoperability standard (XLS-38d) for the XRP Ledger that would enable users to transfer digital assets and data between blockchains regardless of underlying protocol or programming language.\n\nCrypto Market Summary\n\nThere was no shortage of important events in crypto and broader financial markets in Q1. While initially global inflation expectations slowed, macro turbulence revealed cracks in parts of the economy. Critical blows were dealt to Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature and Credit Suisse, among others. Despite the turmoil, crypto markets including XRP, remained resilient.\n\nWhile Silvergate\u2019s fall unfolded over the course of several months, the speed of the bank run on SVB caught many off guard. Exacerbated by social media, SVB\u2019s lack of basic asset-liability-management on the back of rate hikes ignited concerns of other regional banks failing to match their liabilities effectively. The resulting panic saw other institutions such as First Republic and Charles Schwab experience deep sell-offs. Credit Suisse\u2019s collapse shortly thereafter \u2013 while due to largely unrelated factors \u2013 was spurred by the larger market anxiety. While the Swiss government\u2019s intervention quelled initial fears, it raised questions as to the extent to which a sovereign can overrule established law. This unprecedented set of events highlighted the extent of the opacity and interconnectedness across our global financial and crypto markets.\n\nWith the fall of SVB and unexpected shutdown of Signature Bank, much of the crypto world found itself de-banked in the US overnight. While a deposit backstop by the FDIC and Federal Reserve relieved immediate fears, the subsequent closures of the three main banks servicing crypto companies meant that the fiat rails to these banks, utilized by the bulk of the industry to move money in and out of crypto, needed to be rebuilt and new partners to be found. Another casualty in the process was USDC, which had a short-term liquidity driven de-peg down to $0.85 on some exchanges. USDC recovered to $1 within a few days, but market confidence in important on-off ramps was shaken.\n\nThis combination of events \u2013 with previous actions such as the Fed denying the application of crypto-focused bank Custodia for membership, and the Fed, FDIC and OCC issuing a joint statement on liquidity risks to banks servicing the fiat deposits of crypto clients \u2013 continued to fuel sentiment that regulators are attempting to dissuade banks from allowing legal operating entities within crypto to have bank accounts in the US. Some have referred to this as \u201cOperation Choke Point 2.0.\u201d\n\nDespite broader financial turmoil, in Q1, volumes in XRP markets were up 46% QoQ, likely due to a combination of a subsequent recovery in markets as well as large volatile events which tend to spike volumes (Source: CCData). BTC and ETH spot volumes were up 12% and down 12% respectively QoQ. However, derivatives volumes tell a different story with BTC and ETH up 14% and 20% respectively QoQ. This divergence between spot and derivatives volumes could point towards a significant leverage-driven rally with an additional volume boost stemming in part from reassurance with the successful Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, which allowed ETH validators the ability to withdraw 18 million staked tokens that were previously locked up.\n\nHeading into Q2, it is clear that macro uncertainty will continue. Nevertheless, we expect that those who build on a battle-tested foundation of prudent risk management and real-world utility will continue growing once the world emerges from the current climate.\n\nGlobal Regulation\n\nSeveral countries are moving forward with new legislation and licensing regimes to provide clarity for crypto. Specifically, in the EU, the final vote on the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) - which will result in the implementation of a new licensing regime in the 27 member states - passed on April 20. The UK government introduced comprehensive regulatory proposals for a new regulatory regime for crypto, building on prior proposals focusing on stablecoins and financial promotion oftokens. As a result, many in the industry lauded Europe\u2019s efforts to regulate crypto responsibly.\n\nIn the Middle East, the UAE passed a new law governing virtual assets, setting up the country's initial regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies at the federal level. Additionally, in Dubai, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) published their regulatory regime for crypto, consisting of activities-based rulebooks. This also opens up the way for companies to be authorized by VARA and conduct crypto activity within Dubai (rather than in the international free zones). Australia's central bank and Treasury held private meetings with international crypto industry executives on the future of crypto and regulation in the nation. Finally, Hong Kong and Australia opened public consultations on proposed requirements for virtual asset trading platform operators and token mapping respectively.\n\nThe US\u2019s approach to crypto regulation continued to focus on regulation by enforcement instead of rulemaking, as Coinbase and Paxos received Wells notices from the SEC alleging various securities laws violations and lack of registration. SEC Chair Gensler issued a broad warning to yield-earning crypto platforms to come into compliance after Kraken shuttered its staking service, to which Commissioner Peirce denounced her own agency\u2019s actions. The SEC also filed a lawsuit against Justin Sun, affiliated firms and celebrity promoters, alleging market manipulation and sales of unregistered securities. The CFTC sued Binance, CEO Changpeng Zhao and Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim, for allegedly violating US trading and derivatives laws.\n\nUpdate on the SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple\n\nOn March 6, the Court issued a 57 page opinion deciding which opinions of the SEC\u2019s and Ripple\u2019s experts can be considered on summary judgment (and, if needed, at trial) and which opinions need to be \u201cstricken.\u201d Specifically, the SEC\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony regarding the \u201creasonable expectations of an XRP purchaser\u201d was struck from the record, along with their expert who attempted to determine what \u201ccaused\u201d the price of XRP to change. Ripple expects a decision on summary judgment in 2023 though timing is ultimately up to the Court.\n\nXRPL On-chain Activity\n\nOn-Chain Activity Q1 2023 Q4 2022 Q3 2022 Transactions 116,341,516 106,429,153 103,039,261 XRP Burned for Transaction Fees 140,993 101,968 146,433 Avg cost per transaction (in XRP) 0.00121 0.00096 0.0014 Average XRP Closing Price (in USD) 0.40 0.42 0.36 Avg cost per transaction (in USD) 0.000484 0.0004032 0.000504 Volume on DEX (in USD) 114,567,441 85,772,947 117,372,932 Trustlines 8,317,321 8,731,628 9,115,964 Number of New Wallets 140,558 228,143 125,225\n\n(Source: XPMarket.com and CoinMarketCap)\n\nOn-chain activity on XRPL remained strong this quarter, as transactions increased 9% to 116M, versus 106M from the previous quarter. NFTs continue to drive activity and over 1 million assets have been minted on the Ledger since XLS-20 went live on mainnet. This strong activity is also reflected in DEX volumes, which increased 34% versus last quarter to $115M. Note: the average cost per transaction in USD has been corrected on this table (for this and previous quarters) and continues to be more advantageous for users, compared to other blockchains.\n\nOn-Demand Liquidity (ODL)\n\nBitso, the leading crypto exchange in Latin America, announced last quarter it surpassed more than $3.3 billion in transactions between the US and Mexico in 2022 through its institutional crypto solutions utilizing Bitso\u2019s strategic partners, such as Ripple and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. This partnership illustrates the institutional use of cryptocurrency as a cross-border payment solution and an example of the utility of blockchain and crypto.\n\nThe big news of the quarter was the banking crisis and the negative impact to crypto liquidity, which also led to some disruption to liquidity available for ODL, though customer flows recovered quickly. ODL remains robust and continues to serve customer flow to facilitate cross-border payments in a low-cost, timely and reliable method thanks to redundancy and sustainability planning. While there is no denying the industry is facing strong headwinds, Ripple continues to be laser focused on minimizing the impact of the banking crisis on our partners, and providing the best experience for its customers.\n\nDisciplined, Responsible Stakeholders: Q1 Sales and Purchases\n\nLast quarter, total XRP sales by Ripple, net of purchases, were $361.06M vs. $226.31M in the previous quarter. Ripple has continued to sell XRP only in connection with ODL transactions. Since 2020, Ripple has sourced XRP from the open market to ensure there is a sufficient supply of XRP available for our growing ODL business. We continually strive to minimize undue market impact with our purchases by, for example, limiting how much and from whom we purchase XRP.\n\nSummary of Ripple's XRP Sales (dollars in millions) Q1 2023 Q4 2022 Total ODL-related sales* 2,930.87 2,964.28 Total purchases 2,569.81 2,737.97 Net Sales 361.06 226.31\n\nGlobal XRP volume Q1 2023 Q4 2022 ADV XRP (dollars in millions) 1,020.42 698.45 Total XRP volume (dollars in billions)** 91.84 64.31 Net sales as % of total volume 0.44% 0.35%\n\n*All ODL-related sales are attributed to the growth and adoption of ODL.\n\n**Note: Figures were compiled using the CCData API for daily TopTier aggregate volumes which reflects total XRP volume in dollars by exchanges that CCData lists in the TopTier.\n\nTotal sales by Ripple, net of purchases, ended the quarter at 0.44% of global XRP volume according to CCData TopTier (CCTT) volumes. Due to the circumstances of the banking crisis, Ripple stopped purchasing XRP for several days due to the disruption. This activity has since resumed and the company expects to continue to undertake purchases as ODL adoption grows.\n\nLeases\n\nCertain wallets used for XRP sales also provide short-term leases to market makers and participants. This is worth noting, given they are often incorrectly interpreted by market participants as sales. XRP associated with leases are ultimately returned to Ripple. The total amount of leases outstanding in Q1 2023 was 52 million XRP.\n\nReported Volume and Price\n\nDuring Q1 of 2023, the price of XRP appreciated 24% with ADV on centralized exchanges also scaling up to an average of $1.0B, up 46% from Q4 2022.\n\nEscrow\n\nIn Q1 2023, three billion XRP were released out of escrow (one billion each month) in line with prior quarters and the official escrow arrangement. In total, 2.1 billion XRP were returned and subsequently put into new escrow contracts throughout the quarter. Learn more about the XRP escrow process. Note: All figures are reported based on transactions executed during the quarter.\n\nBuilding with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) Community\n\nMessari Adds XRP Ledger to Coverage Messari, a leading crypto analyst firm, wrote about the XRP Ledger in a Protocol Overview, covering everything from how the Ledger processes transactions to unique capabilities of the DEX, what's being built by the community (EVM sidechain, Hooks, etc) and more.\n\nTokenization Projects Since the mainnet launch of the NFT standard XLS-20 in Q4 2022, over 1.2M NFTs have been minted, making XRP Ledger among the top 10 chains for NFT volume and transactions. In addition, there are now 1,500+ apps/exchanges on the XRPL and 950+ public projects on GitHub related to XRPL.\n\nLaunch of XRPL Commons XRPL Commons, a non-profit association focused on educating and empowering the global XRP Ledger community, launched last quarter. With a mission to support a vibrant XRP Ledger ecosystem, XRPL Commons aims to provide education, hands-on building programs, and resources for the XRPL community and developers worldwide. Its focus will encompass regenerative finance, financial inclusion, and intellectual property.\n\nXRPL Labs Launches a Browser-Based DEX Accessing the Native XRPL DEX This is the first desktop trading solution from XRPL Labs, the creators of Xumm, a noncustodial XRPL wallet.
