        "content": "TL;DR\n\nXRP Prediction : XRP expected to reach $0.67 soon and possibly $0.88 by early December; long-term $470 prediction deemed unrealistic.\n\n: XRP expected to reach $0.67 soon and possibly $0.88 by early December; long-term $470 prediction deemed unrealistic. ADA Forecast : Predictions suggest ADA could exceed $0.40 soon, with potential to reach around $11 post-BTC halving.\n\n: Predictions suggest ADA could exceed $0.40 soon, with potential to reach around $11 post-BTC halving. Shiba Inu Growth: Shibarium, Shiba Inu\u2019s blockchain, surpasses 4 million transactions; SHIB wallets increase significantly.\n\nXRP\u2019s Possible Trajectory\n\nAs usual, Ripple\u2019s native token has been the subject of numerous predictions as of late, with some analysts envisioning a rally in the near future. The one using the X (Twitter) handle \u2013 Dark Defender \u2013 believes the asset could surge to $0.67 today (November 24) and continue the uptrend to as high as $0.88 by the beginning of December.\n\n\u201cI am expecting and basing this XRP to hit $0.67 by tomorrow at the latest. Then a small correction and then: Road to: $0.8888 & $1.0507. If you ask me, I like the numbers. I expect to hit $0.88 between November 30 & December 1 (not financial advice),\u201d they said.\n\nAnother person who recently chipped in was the X user CryptoBull. The analyst observed previous breakouts to lay out one of the most outrageous XRP price predictions, setting a future tag of $470 for the coin.\n\nIt is worth noting that the envisioned milestone would most likely remain a mirage since the token\u2019s market capitalization should blast to approximately $250 trillion for this to happen. Recall that the entire market cap of the sector was hovering around $3 trillion during the bull run in 2021 when Bitcoin (BTC) hit an all-time high of almost $70K.\n\nThose willing to dive deeper into the matter and explore how XRP might perform in the remaining quarter of the year could take a look at our video below:\n\nWhere is ADA Headed?\n\nCardano\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 ADA \u2013 was also projected to spike in the following months. Analyst and crypto Youtuber LuckSide Crypto claimed that the asset might surpass the $0.40 level in the near future, while Dan Gambardello \u2013 the Founder of Crypto Capital Venture \u2013 was far more bullish.\n\nThe latter believes that ADA is currently in a pre-bull run condition, suggesting its price could skyrocket months after the BTC halving (scheduled for next spring) to around $11.\n\nThose curious to observe additional predictions involving Cardano\u2019s coin could take a look at our latest video below:\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Advancements\n\nLast but not least, we will touch upon the popular memecoin \u2013 Shiba Inu \u2013 and its recent achievements. As CryptoPotato reported, its layer-2 blockchain solution \u2013 Shibarium \u2013 hit another milestone, with the number of total transactions on the network exceeding 4 million.\n\nIn addition, SHIB wallets with a balance above $0 have surged above 1.2 million, an almost 15,000% increase compared to the 8,460 observed in February 2021."

        "title": "XRP vs. SWIFT: Can XRP Replace the Global Payment Giant and Reach $10,000? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "XRP has been named a possible replacement for SWIFT in the global financial ecosystem.\n\nThe XRP community remains divided on whether XRP can hit $10,000 in the near future.\n\nRecently, an interesting proposition came from Edward Farina, the Head of Social Adoption at XRP Healthcare, arguing that XRP has the potential to replace SWIFT for cross-border payments and surge to $10,000.\n\nSWIFT\u2019s Limitations and XRP\u2019s Value Proposition\n\nSWIFT, the global messaging system for financial institutions, has long been a staple for international money transfers. However, it is not without its flaws. High fees, extended settlement periods, and the requirement for pre-funded accounts in foreign currencies have made SWIFT less than ideal for many users.\n\nOn the other hand, XRP, the digital currency associated with Ripple Labs Inc., offers a compelling alternative. With transaction settlement times as fast as 3 seconds and an average fee of $0.0002, XRP boasts speed, cost-effectiveness, and reliability. Farina argues that these advantages position XRP as a viable replacement for SWIFT, especially considering the vast volume of transactions handled by the latter.\n\nFarina highlights the importance of RippleNet, Ripple\u2019s worldwide network of financial institutions, in pushing XRP adoption. According to him, if RippleNet replaces SWIFT, the billions of transactions that currently travel through the system may possibly be routed through XRP.\n\nFarina\u2019s argument hinges on the basic economic principle of supply and demand. He points out that financial institutions move hundreds of trillions worldwide, and even if XRP captures a small fraction of this volume, it could lead to a surge in utility and demand for the digital asset.\n\nFurthermore, Farina draws attention to XRP\u2019s advantages over other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), particularly in terms of speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, XRP\u2019s reported Transactions Per Second (TPS) of 3,400, though subject to debate, still outpaces Ethereum and other prominent blockchains.\n\nCan XRP Rise to $10,000?\n\nDespite Farina\u2019s optimistic outlook, not everyone in the crypto community is convinced. The current price of XRP is $0.6177, with a volume of $1.29 billion, which presents a significant gap to reach $10,000. Skeptics argue that a 1,616,976% increase from the current position seems implausible, considering the current market conditions and regulatory uncertainties in the broader ecosystem.\n\nWhile Farina\u2019s prediction appears ambitious, the discussion around XRP challenging SWIFT and revolutionizing cross-border payments remains relevant. The dynamic nature of the crypto space, coupled with technological advancements, regulatory shifts, and industry collaborations, could reshape the future of XRP.\n\nNotably, the XRP community anticipates a surge in liquidity in the coming month, driven by the introduction of multiple XRP Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) in the European market. These products, signaling institutional demand, may act as a catalyst for a potential price rally.\n\nMoreover, Ripple\u2019s strategic partnerships within the banking and finance sectors, such as collaborations between its subsidiary Metaco and HSBC for advanced security token custody and the National Bank of Georgia for a CBDC project, highlight Ripple\u2019s substantial growth since September.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "title": "Ripple (XRP) price analysis hints at a possible upsurge: What do experts predict? - crypto.news",
        "content": "Current bullish indicators in Ripple XRP price prediction suggest a potential rise in its short-term value. How far will it go?\n\nXRP, the digital currency associated with the company Ripple, has been experiencing a dynamic phase, marked by both gains and fluctuations.\n\nXRP\u2019s value saw notable changes over the past month. It first experienced a drop amid Binance news which saw its ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s exit and XRP fell to around $0.58 on Nov. 22, however, it has made a swift recovery as of Nov. 24 and is trading at around $0.62 per token.\n\nDespite these recent fluctuations, XRP\u2019s year-to-date (YTD) performance has been impressive. The currency has registered an increase of over 81% since the beginning of the year.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into Ethereum\u2019s current landscape, explore the various factors influencing its price, and provide insights into Ethereum\u2019s price prediction.\n\nRipple and SEC\u2019s ongoing legal battle\n\nThe legal tussle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reached a critical juncture.\n\nThe case, presided over by Judge Analisa Torres in the Southern District of New York, is now entering a settlement phase, which could have significant implications for the future of XRP and the broader crypto market.\n\nOn Nov. 9, both Ripple and the SEC submitted their schedules to Judge Torres, marking the start of a remedies discovery and briefing phase.\n\nThe SEC has requested 90 days for discoveries related to remedies, a request accepted by Ripple, indicating cooperation.\n\nA settlement could bring clarity to the status of XRP, benefiting investors and the cryptocurrency industry at large. It would also save legal costs and remove regulatory uncertainty for Ripple, allowing the company to operate more confidently\u200b\u200b.\n\nThis phase is expected to be challenging, with pro-XRP lawyers like John Deaton suggesting that a settlement of $20 million or less would be a significant success for Ripple.\n\nThe people who\u2019ve argued that the SEC got a 50-50 victory in the @Ripple case are \ud83d\udcaf wrong. It was more like 90-10 in Ripple\u2019s favor. If Ripple ends up paying $20M or less it\u2019s a 99.9% legal victory. https://t.co/Xe6SYBiTCJ \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) November 4, 2023\n\nJeremy Hogan, another lawyer, opines that the Ripple case is essentially concluded, with the SEC dismissing the remaining aspects, thus ruling out further trials in 2024\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe SEC dismissed the rest of the case, so there will be no trial next year. The facts have been set \u2013 nothing new or surprising will be coming out.\n\n\n\nWhich means the Court will be issuing a Final Judgment (probably) sometime next year. Only Ripple needs to worry about that. \ud83d\ude1b \u2014 Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) October 21, 2023\n\nXRP price analysis: will Ripple price rise?\n\nAs of Nov. 24, 2023, XRP is trading at approximately $0.623, showing signs of challenging the overhead trendline of a short-term falling channel.\n\nTechnical indicators such as the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) suggest some signals of a bullish reversal, indicating a possible positive crossover.\n\nThe support at the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) has been influential, helping to sustain XRP\u2019s price above the $0.60 mark\u200b\u200b.\n\nHowever, a recent speculative rally testing the $0.70 neckline failed to establish bullish dominance, leading to a drop to around $0.60.\n\nFor now, XRP has found good support at $0.57 and a current strong resistance is at $0.68, and overcoming this level is crucial for XRP to test higher price points.\n\nA successful breakout could lead to a breakout, possibly at $0.70, potentially setting the stage for a price jump towards $1. Conversely, a reversal could lead to a drop to the $0.58-$0.60 range\u200b\u200b.\n\nIn conclusion, XRP\u2019s price analysis indicates a cautious optimism with a mix of potential upside and downside risks. As with any cryptocurrency, market sentiment and broader economic factors could play a significant role in its future price movements.\n\nRipple (XRP) price prediction\n\nRenowned for his accurate XRP price predictions, Dark Defender, a chart analyst focused on XRP, has provided valuable insights into Ripple\u2019s potential market movements.\n\nRecently, he correctly predicted XRP\u2019s rise to the $60-70 cent range on Nov. 13. Now, he envisions XRP escalating to 87 cents to $1.05 in the very short term, indicating the currency is on the brink of a parabolic move.\n\nMeanwhile, in his latest update, Dark Defender noted, that XRP has formed a cup & handle pattern in the daily time frame. He has set targets for $1.05 & $1.88 with the Elliott Waves, and now the Cup-Handle pattern to reach the targets.\n\nHi all. $XRP formed a cup & handle pattern in the daily time frame.\n\n\n\nWe set targets for $1.05 & $1.88 with the Elliott Waves, and now the Cup-Handle pattern is also blinking XRP to reach the targets.\n\n\n\nCan the handle be extended towards $0.5286 Support?\n\n\n\nWe still need to close\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SvVokOYTs8 \u2014 Dark Defender (@DefendDark) November 21, 2023\n\nHowever, he points out that for these targets to be valid, XRP must not close under the primary support of $0.6044 for two consecutive days.\n\nWhile these ripple projections and the ripple expected price offer a bullish outlook, the volatile nature of the crypto market means these predictions should be considered cautiously. Trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\n\n\nRead more: Ripple Payments expands its business to 70 markets"
