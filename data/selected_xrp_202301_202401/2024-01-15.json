        "title": "Ripple vs SEC : Potential $3 Billion Penalty Looms - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nOnce again we are back to the square, and the Ripple vs SEC case is far from the end. In a recent analysis of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, Zach Rector, a prominent XRP YouTuber and financial expert, speculates that Ripple might face a hefty penalty of over $3 billion if Judge Analisa Torres rules that On-Demand Liquidity (ODL)-related sales are securities. The lawsuit is currently in the remedies phase, and the SEC has filed a motion to compel Ripple to produce financial statements and information regarding institutional XRP sales.\n\nSEC\u2019s Request for Documents is Still Pending\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent action occurred on January 11 when it submitted a formal request to the Southern District of New York Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn. The request specifically asks the court to mandate Ripple\u2019s submission of financial statements and sales contracts.\n\nDespite many calls and emails, Ripple has not presented any post-complaint documents. In defiance of Ripple, the SEC is requesting two specific documents and one interrogatory.\n\nAnalyst Pulls the Rug to Millions at stake, What next?\n\nOn the other side, Rector in his YouTube video highlights the potential billions at stake for Ripple, emphasizing that the SEC claims the company sold about $3 billion worth of XRP since the lawsuit\u2019s initiation. While the initial SEC claim was significantly higher, legal experts anticipate a reduction during the remedies proceeding. Rector predicts that the final penalty could surpass the $3 billion mark if Judge Torres deems ODL-related sales as securities.\n\nAfter so much of chaos and the recent SEC move, there is a possibility of a negative ruling. So if that happens, Rector expects Ripple to file an appeal in the Second Circuit, especially if the judge rules that ODL-related XRP sales constitute an investment contract. Rector suggests that confident in legal guidance, Ripple would likely challenge any such ruling.\n\nIt\u2019s Not Over Yet\u2026\n\nAs Ripple prepares to respond to the SEC\u2019s motion to compel, the lawsuit\u2019s remedies proceeding is set to conclude by February 12, 2024, with the SEC\u2019s last motion scheduled for April 29, 2024. While there\u2019s no official ruling date, pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli speculates that the judge might issue a decision in early summer, adding a layer of anticipation to Ripple\u2019s legal journey.\n\nBoth sides have been given an extra month by the court, which is on top of the discovery date for remedies. This schedule gives the SEC time to make its case to the court and gives Ripple a chance to say no. There is a lot of talk that a settlement may be on the horizon since dates are coming up and Ripple and the SEC have had a history of bad blood in the past."

        "content": "Prominent Financial expert and XRP YouTuber Zach Rector speculates that Ripple could pay over $3B in disgorgement to the U.S. SEC if Judge Torres rules ODL-related sales are securities.\n\nZach Rector claims that Ripple could pay billions of dollars as a fine to the U.S. SEC for violating federal securities laws via its institutional sales of XRP.\n\nRemedies Phase of SEC Vs Ripple\n\nRector made this known during his recent SEC v. Ripple case analysis on YouTube. Notably, the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit is currently in the remedies phase. Last week, the SEC filed a motion to compel Ripple to produce two documents and one interrogatory.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe requested documents include Ripple\u2019s audited financial statements from 2022-2023, as well as the company\u2019s contracts related to institutional sales dated after the regulator initially filed the complaint in December 2020.\n\nFor the interrogatory, the SEC wants Ripple to disclose how much proceeds it made through its institutional XRP sales since the complaint was filed.\n\nBillions of Dollars At Stake\n\nWith the SEC focusing on Ripple\u2019s post-complaint financial statements, Rector speculated that \u201cbillions [of dollars] are at stake\u201d for the popular crypto payments company.\n\nHe noted that Ripple risks paying billions of dollars as a fine if Judge Analisa Torres rules that all of the company\u2019s post-complaint sales are securities.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to Rector, the SEC claims that Ripple has sold about $3 billion worth of XRP since it sued the company in December 2020. At the beginning of the lawsuit, the SEC claimed that Ripple raised $1.3 billion in 2013 by selling unregistered securities.\n\nThe figure was drastically reduced to around $750 million after Judge Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales and other distributions of XRP do not constitute unregistered securities.\n\nWhile many legal experts speculate that Ripple might reduce the $750M during the remedies proceeding, Rector predicted that the company could pay more.\n\n\u201cIf the judge rules that all of these ODL (On-Demand Liquidity now rebranded to Ripple Payments) sales from 2020 to 2024 were securities, the tallies enter into billions of dollars worth. It might even be more than the original $3 billion that the SEC has cited. This is why billions are at stake for Ripple,\u201d he remarked.\n\nRipple to Appeal Negative Ruling\n\nNotably, Rector expects Ripple to file an appeal in the Second Circuit if Judge Torres rules that the company\u2019s post-complaint sales of XRP, including those related to ODL, constitute an investment contract.\n\nThe YouTuber said Ripple must have gotten assurance from its lawyers that there was no way ODL-related sales could be deemed as securities.\n\nHe noted that clients purchasing XRP for ODL purposes are not expecting to make profits from Ripple\u2019s efforts. Hence, he speculated that Ripple would appeal the ruling if Judge Torres found ODL-related XRP sales to be securities.\n\nRipple to Oppose SEC Motion to Compel\n\nIn the meantime, Ripple is expected to file its response to the SEC\u2019s motion to compel on January 19. Ripple will be opposing the request in its upcoming motion.\n\nThe remedies proceeding of the lawsuit is still in the discovery phase, which is scheduled to be concluded by February 12, 2024. As scheduled by the court, the SEC will file the last motion of the remedies proceeding on April 29, 2024. After which, the court will issue its ruling with respect to the remedies.\n\nThere is no official date on when the judge might issue the ruling. However, pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli speculates that the judge\u2019s ruling could be issued in early summer."
