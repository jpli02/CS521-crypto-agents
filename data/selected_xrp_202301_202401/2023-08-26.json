        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe ongoing bearish sentiment in the crypto market has led to a 60% decline in XRP\u2019s open interest (OI) since its peak in July when it was valued at $1.19 billion. Unexpectedly, this drop was noted right after the XRP\u2019s gains following Ripple Labs\u2019 court victory against the SEC in July. The downturn is not the only factor pulling the rug for XRP, the SEC\u2019s decision to appeal the ruling has fueled selling activity, and there are concerns that XRP\u2019s price could fall below the crucial level of $0.52.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the scope of XRP in the beast mode.\n\nTrader\u2019s Losing Interest in XRP?\n\nDue to less interest from the traders, XRP\u2019s open interest (OI) has experienced a significant decline of $725 million. While on-chain data says it\u2019s going downwards drastically. But data comparison from last month shows a peak of $1.19 billion, from here the OI levels have fallen to approx $465 million today, marking a negative growth of 60.92%.\n\nWhat is the link of OI with XRP Price?\n\nIf you look at the charts well, XRP OI represents the total value of derivative contracts linked to XRP\u2019s price movement, including Futures and Options contracts. Based on this the value reflects total investment by market participants in these contracts. A fall from $1.19 billion to $465 million reveals there is a lot of bearish movement traders are selling XRP hastily, which is often interpreted as a lack of confidence in the token\u2019s future price direction.\n\nAccording to the Coinglass data majority of traders have placed their XRP OI orders on the Binance exchange, with a cumulative value of $128.85 million, and $93.23 million on Bybit. One of the reasons for losing the position is also the fear of Binance going bank run in the near term.\n\nNotably, XRP\u2019s value reached its peak last month at $1.19 billion, a level not seen in recent years since November 2021. During that period, XRP traded around $1.20, which coincided with the peak of the previous bull market. The primary driving force behind this surge was the regulatory lawsuit victory. A U.S. federal court ruling clarified that XRP is not a security, instantly causing XRP\u2019s price to double.\n\nAny Hope for XRP Price?\n\nAlthough predictions may disappoint XRP enthusiasts, there\u2019s a silver lining. The support levels for the digital asset suggest that any upcoming losses might be small. So, while a drop is expected, it might not be a sudden and significant decline, but rather a gradual decrease.\n\nCurrently, bulls and bears are at loggerheads to wage a war to trigger the next move. As of writing, XRP price trades at $0.523, surging over 1.7% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "PayPal\u2019s announcement lifted its shares by 2.66% on Monday, reflecting confidence in the troubled crypto market. Elonator\u2019s (ETOR) development and its distinct community-driven, passive revenue model can potentially change the landscape of crypto payment systems.\n\nIn this article, let\u2019s ponder on Elonator with PayPal\u2019s stable coin PayPal USD (PYUSD) and Ripple\u2019s native token (XRP), emphasizing its creative approach and outlining how it may foster wider crypto acceptance.\n\n<< Click Here To Learn More About Elonator Presale >>\n\nPayPal Rolls Out Its Stablecoins\n\nPayPal introduced a US dollar stablecoin on August 7, 2023, becoming the first major financial technology corporation to accept digital currencies for payments and transfers. PayPal USD (PYUSD) is a payment system backed by extremely liquid and secure assets. While stablecoins have been available for years, they are yet to make inroads into the mainstream consumer payments sector.\n\nYou may exchange your PYUSD for US dollars whenever you want, and that\u2019s not all. It may be used to obtain other cryptocurrencies from PayPal\u2019s portfolio, such as Bitcoin. PYUSD is more than simply a token; it\u2019s the beginning of a new era of dollars on the blockchain network. This isn\u2019t simply a milestone for PayPal and Paxos, according to Paxos on the X messaging network; it\u2019s \u201clike dropping a beat that\u2019ll get the entire financial industry grooving.\u201d\n\nQuick Transactions With XRP\n\nRipple is a blockchain-based digital payment network and protocol, as well as the creator of its cryptocurrency, XRP. Rather than using blockchain mining, Ripple confirms transactions using a consensus method via a consortium of bank-owned computers. It securely and rapidly transfers payments across borders at a minimal cost. It acts as a bridge currency, allowing financial institutions to convert both crypto and fiat currencies at a lower cost.\n\nIn response to Bitcoin technology, Ripple Labs, a technology firm located in the United States, built Ripple\u2019s blockchain architecture in 2012. The resultant payment network, RippleNet, was created to give banks a quicker, more cost-effective, and simplified option for completing cross-border transactions. RippleNet isn\u2019t just the main event; it\u2019s also the brain behind the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a genius system for settling real-time transactions and a snazzy currency exchange and remittance network.\n\nNow Trace Transactions With Etor Tokens\n\nThe Elonator Token is ready to take over the top crypto community. It is a wild fusion of Elon Musk\u2019s cutting-edge intelligence with the Terminator\u2019s uncompromising force from The Terminator movies. This game-changer is more than simply a token; it represents a completely new way of pondering about memes and money.\n\nElonator is a top crypto community-focused initiative that has been built and developed to empower as many people as possible..\n\n<< Buy Into The Elonator Presale >>\n\nIt provides genuine value to investors by preserving openness and accessibility, allowing anybody to evaluate and verify the actions. Anyone having an ETOR contract address may simply trace transaction flows using the Ethereum blockchain explorer. Participating is made easy by holding the ETOR token (1 ETOR = 1 Vote). A liquidity lock is also implemented to maintain the stability and security of the ETOR token\u2019s price and to avoid significant price volatility protecting the tokens.\n\nIt\u2019s Time To Become An Elonator Presale Investor\n\nPayPal rocks the boat with its Paypal stable coin PYUSD, a game-changer in the making. Ripple\u2019s no stranger to the party either. With its XRP magic, it\u2019s speeding up cross-border payments.\n\nBut the Elonator token is all set to mesmerize on the stage with its redefined crypto payments and transactions. It\u2019s not just a token; it\u2019s a new way of thinking.\n\nNow is the time to invest in the Elonator presale and win exciting prizes.\n\nFor All Things Elonator, Including Its Presale:\n\nPresale: https://buy.elonator.com/\n\nWebsite: https://elonator.com\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/ElonatorCoin\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElonatorCoin\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"
