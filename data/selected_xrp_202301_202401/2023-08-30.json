        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSeveral XRP transactions that make up an impressive total amount together \u2014 close to half a billion XRP \u2014 have been spotted by the popular crypto tracking service Whale Alert over the period of the last 24 hours.\n\nRipple Labs giant took an active part in this, transferring part of this massive crypto stash.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 424,018,481 #XRP (225,957,060 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/E8kW88yOPX \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 30, 2023\n\nRipple sells 59 million XRP, with 483 million XRP on the move in total\n\nThe above crypto tracker spotted three XRP transfers, carrying 424,018,481 XRP; 31,000,000 XRP and 27,600,000 XRP.\n\nOf these three transfers, Ripple's was the second one as it moved 31 million XRP to an anonymous wallet address. The company often transfers several tens of millions of XRP to crypto exchanges to sell crypto for fiat to cover its operational expenses or send XRP to its customers \u2014 banks and various other financial institutions. Often, Ripple also makes large XRP transactions to support its ODL platforms.\n\nThirty-one million XRP is equivalent to $16,530,182, and Ripple transferred it to a wallet marked by Whale Alert as \"unknown.\" Still, details provided by the XRP-focused platform Bithomp show that this anonymous wallet, in reality, also belongs to Ripple.\n\nThe biggest transaction here \u2014 424,018,481 XRP \u2014 was made between two anonymous whales, and Bithomp did not share any details about them. Also, an unknown wallet owner transferred 27,600,000 XRP to the Bitstamp exchange to sell this crypto lump. Bithomp identified the sender as Ripple Labs.\n\nSEC loses case to Grayscale, but there's a catch\n\nAs reported by U.Today on Tuesday, Grayscale scored a victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in court. Since this is the third crypto company that has beaten the U.S. securities regulator; first in was Ripple, then Caitlin Long's Custodian Bank, now Grayscale's turn has come.\n\nEven though, the victory of the latter does not automatically ensure the conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a Bitcoin ETF. Still, victory in this case means a lot to the crypto community and its future.\n\nIn light of this news, the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged back above the $27,000 level on Tuesday, and XRP printed a rise by over 6%.\n\nThe court ruled that \"denial of Grayscale's proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products.\"\n\nNow, the community is looking forward to Coinbase also beating the SEC in court."

        "content": "Wed 30 Aug 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nThe legal battle between Ripple and the SEC remains fierce, constantly bringing new dimensions. Veteran crypto lawyer John Deaton has lifted the veil on a secret XRP memo, potentially decisive in influencing the outcome of the ongoing trial.\n\nIn brief\n\nCrypto lawyer John Deaton reveals a secret memo from 2018 related to XRP.\n\nMany crypto observers believe this document could play a decisive role in the course of the current trial\n\nThe secret memo that\u2019s shaking up the Ripple trial\n\nThe legal battle between Ripple and the SEC is reaching a key moment, marked by an unexpected development. While the trial\u2019s start date was initially set for August 23, with an initial estimate between April and June 2024, this timetable has undergone a slight shift. Curiously, this postponement seems to be in Ripple\u2019s favor.\n\nAt the heart of this situation, lawyer John Deaton, who represents XRP holders, has brought to light a secret memo linked to XRP. Considered by many observers to be a key element, this document could play a decisive role in the unfolding of the current trial.\n\nThe memo focuses on questions posed in June 2018 by Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, and David Schwartz, CTO, to William Hinman and Jay Clayton of the SEC.\n\nThe questions raised in this secret memo by Garlinghouse and Schwartz concern the clarity surrounding XRP\u2019s status three months after Hinman\u2019s memorable speech. During that speech, Hinman had excluded Bitcoin and Ethereum from the securities category, leaving XRP out, a crypto that at the time closely rivaled Ethereum in terms of capitalization.\n\nDeciphering the SEC\u2019s perception of XRP: Clarity unveiled!\n\nA closer look at the secret memo reveals that Garlinghouse and Schwartz expressed questions at the time about the absence of any mention of XRP in Hinman\u2019s speech. This omission had raised doubts as to whether the SEC perceived XRP as a security or not.\n\nRecently disclosed documents have authenticated both the meeting and the SEC memo, adding credibility to John Deaton\u2019s revelations. The lawyer pointed out that the annotations of William Hinman\u2019s lawyer, also present at the meeting, could provide crucial clues.\n\nThe omission of XRP as a non-security in Hinman\u2019s speech has given rise to various speculations. Experts argue that the commission does not recognize any intrinsic value associated with this digital currency. This omission reflects differing interpretations of the Howey test, which remains at the heart of the controversy.\n\nNow that more than two and a half years have passed since the XRP trial began, the time for a conclusion finally seems to be dawning on the horizon. However, Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 recent ruling that XRP\u2019s programmatic sales are not securities under the Howey test is currently being challenged by the SEC. The SEC has been granted leave to file an interlocutory appeal. Whatever the outcome of the trial, optimism about a possible victory for Ripple continues to gain strength.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Ripple (XRP) News: Breakout Soon or Impending Doom? - YouHodler.com",
        "content": "Seize the opportunity to trade a dynamic cryptocurrency with real-world utility and transformative potential. Take advantage of XRP volatility right now.\n\nIn July, Ripple Labs received a landmark court ruling by the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC). The positive news sent XRP prices skyrocketing as investors celebrated the win over the SEC and its supposed legitimacy in U.S. markets. However, bearish sentiment is starting to creep in on the broader crypto market.\n\nDoes this mean XRP will erase its recent gains or will it ride the victory wave to new heights? We\u2019ll cover all that and more in our latest \u201ccoin of the week\u201d article. \u201c\n\nRipple (XRP) price on a downtrend after SEC ruling\n\nXRP/USDT chart by TradingView\n\nEven though Judge Torres ruled in favor of Ripple labs - saying that XRP is not a security - XRP\u2019s price has been in a downtrend.\n\nOn July 14th, XRP price jumped $.47 to $.80 (~70% increase). Yet, in the 30 days following that massive spike, XRP has crept back down to around $.55 ( -24.13%).\n\nThere are three primary reasons for this price decline:\n\n1. XRP death cross appears on the daily chart\n\nThis Monday, during the early Asian trading hours, a quick-moving 50-day single moving average (SMA) crossed below the slow-moving 200-day SMA. This event, known as a \u201cdeath cross\u201d amongst crypto traders, is a clear call to sell XRP.\n\n\u200d2. Relative Strength Index (RSI) is weak\n\nXRP/USDT RSI by TradingView\n\nFurther supporting the death cross is XRP\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI). This technical indicator began moving in the negative direction showing XRP\u2019s downtrend is still strong and unlikely to change in the short term.\n\n\u200d3. Crypto investors are still fearful\n\nWhile the crypto market is in recovery after its most recent micro-crash, the overall market sentiment is still somewhat fearful. While some coins can experience bullish periods during a bear market, it is rare. At the moment, XRP investors seem to be following the market trend and are hesitant to buy XRP at this time until conditions improve.\n\nOn-chain data suggests XRP is still undervalued\n\nThere is a silver lining to all the above news. New on-chain data suggests that XRP\u2019s price is undervalued. While the bearish sentiment across the crypto market is preventing an XRP price breakout at the moment, it is not out of the question in the long term.\n\nAnalyzing Santiment\u2019s Network Value to Transaction Volume (NVT), one can look at the underlying transactional activity on a given blockchain network. XRP\u2019s NVT ratio increased a shocking 340% from August 18th to August 24th.\n\n\u200d\n\nThis suggests that there is consistent activity on the Ripple blockchain despite the price going down.\n\nIt\u2019s reasons like this that long-term investors are still stashing their XRP bags and holding out for a momentum shift in the future. When that shift happens is anyone\u2019s guess but some analysts predict it could be a rebound of 20% - 25%.\n\nVolatility equals opportunity\n\nAs we have said many times before in YouHodler history, \u201cvolatility equals opportunity.\u201d All financial markets move in waves. Many people think you can only profit from the positive waves. However, there are just as many opportunities to profit in the downward waves as well.\n\nYouHodler makes this easier than ever with our MultiHODL feature. Open up an XRP position in two directions (up or down) to capitalize on this volatility. We\u2019ve already seen plenty of sharp XRP movements in the past month and more are surely to come.\n\nSo try Multi HODL and start testing out your trading strategies today. MultiHODL also recently integrated TradingView charts in the features so you can easily utilize technical indicators and conduct in-depth analysis on XRP and all our favorite cryptocurrencies.\n\nDisclaimer: The content should not be construed as investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

        "title": "Western Union Adopts Ripple\u2019s Blockchain and XRP to Revolutionize Cross-Border Payments - CoinTrust",
        "content": "Western Union, a prominent player in the global money transfer services sector, has recently disclosed its adoption of Ripple\u2019s blockchain technology and integration of the XRP token. This strategic move marks a significant achievement for both Western Union and Ripple, as they collaboratively harness the potential of distributed ledger technology and digital assets to enhance the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and security of cross-border money transfers.\n\nThe adoption of Ripple\u2019s blockchain technology and incorporation of the XRP token into its operations signifies Western Union\u2019s intent to leverage innovative solutions for streamlining its cross-border payment capabilities. Ripple, operating as a global payment network, effectively connects banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges, and corporations through its proprietary blockchain platform, RippleNet. The underlying RippleNet infrastructure facilitates rapid, economical, and dependable cross-border transactions, utilizing diverse currencies and assets, including the native cryptocurrency of the network, XRP. Functioning as a bridge currency, XRP enables seamless value exchange between various fiat currencies and other digital assets, further enhancing its utility and significance.\n\nGlobal Money Transfer Giant Teams Up with Ripple to Optimize International Transactions\n\nThe journey toward this alliance began in 2018 when Western Union embarked on testing Ripple\u2019s technology, a venture that yielded impressive results, solidifying the potential benefits of this collaboration. According to Hikmet Ersek, CEO of Western Union, Ripple\u2019s technology holds the promise of transforming the company\u2019s settlement processes from spanning days to mere seconds. Furthermore, the integration of this technology has the potential to yield cost reductions of up to 60%, while simultaneously enhancing compliance and security standards. Ersek also expressed openness to the idea of employing XRP as a bridge currency for select transactions, particularly in emerging markets where liquidity constraints pose challenges.\n\nThe convergence of Western Union and Ripple holds broader implications for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, serving as tangible evidence of the practical applications and advantages of these innovative concepts. Western Union, renowned globally for its extensive reach and credibility in money transfer services, boasts a network of over 550,000 agent locations spanning more than 200 countries and territories. The assimilation of Ripple\u2019s technology and XRP token into Western Union\u2019s ecosystem equips the company to offer its customer base a swifter, more economical, and secure method of sending and receiving funds across international borders, thereby enhancing its competitive stance within the competitive global remittance market.\n\nTwo pioneering technologies, RippleNet and XRP, hold immense potential for Western Union, a dominant figure in the money transfer domain. RippleNet serves as a worldwide network interlinking banks and financial institutions to facilitate real-time cross-border transactions through Ripple\u2019s blockchain technology. By joining the RippleNet network, Western Union is presented with the opportunity to access untapped markets, expand its operational horizons, and simplify complex procedures associated with cross-border payments. This collaboration also allows Western Union to leverage the standardized regulations, governance, compliance framework, and robust data analytics capabilities inherent to the RippleNet ecosystem.\n\nXRP, functioning as the backbone of RippleNet, assumes the role of a bridge currency, bridging the gap between diverse fiat currencies. The incorporation of XRP into Western Union\u2019s processes bears the potential to mitigate liquidity-related expenses by eliminating the need for pre-funding accounts across multiple nations. Additionally, the adoption of XRP enhances transaction efficiency by facilitating rapid and cost-effective settlements, accomplished within seconds with nominal transaction fees. This approach equips Western Union to offer its clientele competitive exchange rates and accelerated transaction times, thereby delivering superior value.\n\nThe synergy between RippleNet and XRP positions Western Union to secure a competitive edge within the burgeoning global remittance market, anticipated to swell to a staggering $930 billion by 2026. This strategic alignment empowers Western Union to elevate its value proposition, bolster market share, and cultivate increased profitability. As Western Union\u2019s integration of Ripple\u2019s blockchain technology and XRP token progresses, it not only optimizes its own operations but also contributes to reshaping the landscape of international money transfers, ushering in an era of heightened efficiency and accessibility."

        "title": "Ripple IPO: Everything you need to know about Ripple Labs - City Index Singapore",
        "content": "As Ripple plans to celebrate after winning its SEC lawsuit, investors will be hoping there\u2019s an IPO at the end of the tunnel. Learn everything we know about the company behind XRP and its potential listing.\n\nWhat do we know about the Ripple IPO?\n\nRipple Labs \u2013 the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency \u2013 has not filed for an initial public offering (IPO). But the CEO of Ripple Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC back in 2022 that the company would explore the option of an IPO once its lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission was over.\n\nFast forward to August 2023, and Ripple announced it would be hosting a grand celebration in New York to celebrate its win, which has reignited talk over the possibility of a Ripple IPO.\n\nIn April 2023, Ripple held a private \u2018road show\u2019, meeting potential investors to gauge their interest in its potential listing.\n\nMany believe that Ripple\u2019s IPO could have a significant impact on the value of the XRP cryptocurrency itself \u2013 rather ambitious price targets have now been set for the coin, given it\u2019s experienced a slow 18 months of US growth amid the lawsuit.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to distinguish between the shares of the public company Ripple Labs, and the token XRP.\n\nHow much is Ripple worth?\n\nRipple was valued at $9.8 billion in 2019 after it raised $200 million in a Series C funding round. The company bought back the shares it sold in that financing round in 2022, boosting Ripple\u2019s value to $15 billion.\n\nHow to trade the Ripple IPO\n\nAs there is no confirmed listing of Ripple, there\u2019s no way to take a position on the IPO. However, once Ripple has gone public, you\u2019ll be able to trade its shares in the same way as any other stock on the market.\n\nIn the meantime, you can trade thousands of other shares with City Index in these easy steps:\n\nOpen a City Index account, or log in if you\u2019re already a customer Search for the company you want to trade in our award-winning trading platforms Choose your position and size, and your stop and limit levels Place the trade\n\nAlternatively, you can practise with a risk-free demo trading account, and get to grips with trading shares with virtual funds before you tackle live markets.\n\nIt\u2019s important to take care when trading an IPO, as the share price can be volatile for the first few months.\n\nWhat does Ripple do?\n\nRipple Labs is a technology company that serves as both a digital payment network and a cryptocurrency provider. It was founded in 2012 by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb.\n\nRippleNet is the name of the company\u2019s digital decentralised payment network, which facilitates online transactions. Unlike other financial payment platforms, RippleNet is underpinned by blockchain technology, which is used to improve the transparency and security of the network. RippleNet enables individuals and institutions to exchange money regardless of location.\n\nRipple\u2019s other service is its XRP token \u2013 the cryptocurrency that is tailored to work on the RippleNet network, which speeds up the platform\u2019s transactions. XRP can be used to buy other cryptocurrencies, as well as fiat currencies. The digital asset consistently ranks among the largest cryptocurrencies by total market capitalisation.\n\nAlthough some consider the firm a crypto company, Ripple would say it is a money transfer system that just happens to offer a cryptocurrency.\n\nThis is what led to Ripple\u2019s legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company was accused of conducting an unregistered securities offering by selling its native crypto asset \u2013 XRP. Ripple argued that XRP is not a security, but a digital currency, and therefore didn\u2019t fit into the SEC\u2019s traditional framework. The court has now ruled in favour of Ripple \u2013 which not only has ramifications for XRP and Ripple but for the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe XRP token\u2019s price shot up on the news \u2013 rising by 76% in the hours following the ruling, but falling back soon after.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s unlikely this will be the end of the SEC vs. Ripple, as they have the opportunity to appeal against the summary judgements.\n\nDespite the lawsuit, Ripple continued to expand in other markets outside of the US and through partnerships with other businesses, particularly in the Middle East. In 2021, the number of transactions on RippleNet more than doubled \u2013 with total payment volume reaching $10 billion.\n\nHow does Ripple make money?\n\nRipple makes money through a variety of means:\n\nSelling its XRP token \u2013 Although after the initial sale, XRP is decentralised and Ripple Labs makes no money from forward transactions, any new distribution will come from Ripple Payment fees \u2013 Any transaction fee is paid to Ripple, as there is no incentive to validators on the blockchain (unlike some other networks) Profits from investment \u2013 Ripple has acquired other companies, such as Tranglo, and will profit from their revenue streams Interest fees on loans \u2013 In 2020, Ripple came out with a loan product to access on-demand liquidity, which is collateralised with XRP tokens\n\nIs Ripple profitable?\n\nAs a private company, Ripple\u2019s finances are still undisclosed. However, previous statements from a company spokesperson have implied that Ripple is cash flow positive and has a strong balance sheet."
