        "content": "TL;DR\n\nXRP\u2019s price exceeds $0.56, benefiting from an overall bullish crypto market; its market capitalization stands near $30 billion.\n\nOngoing lawsuit against the US SEC has caused notable XRP price fluctuations; Ripple recently achieved three significant partial victories in the case, boosting its token\u2019s value.\n\nA mid-July ruling favored Ripple, resulting in a 70% XRP price surge; recent developments include the dismissal of the SEC\u2019s appeal and Ripple\u2019s CEO and Executive Chairman being cleared of all charges.\n\nXRP Rising Amid a Green Crypto Background\n\nRipple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 is once again among the top-performing cryptocurrencies, with its price surpassing the $0.56 mark (per CoinGecko\u2019s data). One major factor prompting that surge could be the bullish outlook of the entire market, where most digital assets are well-positioned in the green zone.\n\nXRP is currently the fifth largest in terms of market capitalization (almost $30 billion), and its valuation has spiked by approximately 14% in the past two weeks.\n\nThe Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit\n\nThe developments surrounding the legal battle between the blockchain enterprise and America\u2019s securities regulator (which started in December 2020) have caused significant price swings for XRP over the years. Ripple has recently won three landmark partial victories, which triggered a rally for its native token.\n\nThe most spectacular price increase occurred in mid-July when a US Federal Judge determined that the company\u2019s programmatic sales from years ago did not constitute an offer of investment contracts. Shortly after the ruling, XRP exploded by over 70%, surpassing $0.85.\n\nThe second win happened at the beginning of the month when the magistrates dismissed the SEC\u2019s intention to appeal the initial court decision. Most recently, Ripple\u2019s CEO \u2013 Brad Garlinghouse \u2013 and Executive Chairman \u2013 Chris Larsen \u2013 were cleared of all charges brought by the watchdog.\n\nSuch events have also supposedly affected XRP\u2019s positive price performance lately. Those willing to observe the asset\u2019s possible trajectory in Q4, 2023 could take a look at the video below:"

        "title": "To a growing number of scientists, climate change is an \u2018emergency\u2019 - The Washington Post",
        "content": "Bill Ripple had never been an activist. The Oregon State University ecologist had spent his career wandering through the hills and canyons of Yellowstone National Park, tracking the health of wolves and other large carnivores. Nor was he particularly outspoken: As a college student, he was so concerned about taking a debate class that he considered dropping out and returning to his family farm.\n\nBut then, in 2018, Ripple saw pictures of a town called Paradise, Calif., completely destroyed by wildfire. Houses had disappeared in the blaze; all that remained were twisted hunks of metal and glass. Ripple started writing a new academic paper. He called it: \u201cWorld Scientists\u2019 Warning of a Climate Emergency.\u201d He sent it to colleagues to see if anyone wanted to sign on. By the time the paper was published in the journal Bioscience in 2019, it had 11,000 signatures from scientists around the world \u2014 it now has more than 15,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy life completely changed,\u201d Ripple said. He is the subject of a 30-minute Oregon State documentary; he gets constant media requests and calls to collaborate from scientists around the world. Last week, he published a new paper on the state of the climate system.\n\nIt was called \u201cEntering Uncharted Territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cScientists are more willing to speak out,\u201d Ripple said. \u201cAs a group, we\u2019ve been pretty hesitant, historically.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI feel like scientists have a moral obligation to warn humanity.\u201d\n\nAfter a few years of record-breaking temperatures and extreme weather events, Ripple\u2019s experience is a sign of how climate scientists \u2014 who once refrained from entering the public fray \u2014 are now using strident language to describe the warming planet. References to \u201cclimate emergency\u201d and \u201cclimate crisis,\u201d once used primarily by activist groups like the British-based Extinction Rebellion or the U.S.-based Sunrise Movement, are spiking in the academic literature. Meanwhile, scientists\u2019 communication to the media and the public has gotten more exasperated \u2014 and more desperate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, scientists released a paper showing that the world\u2019s \u201ccarbon budget\u201d \u2014 the amount of greenhouse gas emissions the world can still emit without boosting global temperatures more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2014 has shrunk by a third. The world has only six years left at current emissions levels before racing past that temperature limit.\n\n\u201cThere are no technical scenarios globally available in the scientific literature that would support that that is actually possible, or can even describe how that would be possible,\u201d Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London, told reporters in a call.\n\nTim Lenton, one of the co-authors on Ripple\u2019s most recent paper and a professor of earth system science at the University of Exeter, said that 2023 has been filled with temperatures so far beyond the norm that \u201cthey\u2019re very hard to rationalize.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fitting a simple statistical model,\u201d he said.\n\nLenton said he isn\u2019t afraid to use terms like \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201cclimate and ecological crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you say \u2018urgent\u2019 to a politician \u2026 that isn\u2019t really enough,\u201d he said.\n\nThe language has spilled into academic publications as well. As recently as 2015, only 32 papers in the Web of Science research database included the term \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d In 2022, 862 papers contained the phrase.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. In the 2000s and even early 2010s, most scientists shied away making any statements that could be seen as \u201cpolitical.\u201d Jacquelyn Gill, a professor of climate science and paleoecology at the University of Maine, said that when she was doing her PhD in those years, senior academics warned her against deviating at all from the science when interacting with the media or the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were actively told if we start to talk about solutions, if we start to talk about the policy implications of our work, we will have abandoned our supposed \u2018scientific neutrality,\u2019\u201d Gill said. \u201cAnd then people will not trust us anymore on the science.\u201d\n\nSusan Joy Hassol, a science communication expert who has worked with climate researchers for years, says that even a decade ago, climate scientists were uncertain what their role was in communicating the dangers of rising temperatures. \u201cI think at least some of them felt that scientists communicate through IPCC reports,\u201d Hassol said, referring to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \u201c\u2018We do our science, we publish, we put together these reports, and it\u2019s kind of up to other people to listen.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, she said, that has changed. \u201cWe have reached this stage of crisis,\u201d she said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the fact that emissions aren\u2019t going down \u2014 or that policy hasn\u2019t responded quickly enough to the challenge. (Carbon dioxide emissions related to energy use have continued to climb, even after the brief downturn of the coronavirus pandemic.) As the impacts of climate change escalate, scientists say, their language has changed to meet the moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to terms like \u201cclimate emergency,\u201d Gill says, \u201cit\u2019s a little bit of strategy and a lot of honesty.\u201d While climate scientists are still discussing whether warming is accelerating, she added, \u201cit\u2019s clear the impacts are becoming more noticeable and in-your-face.\u201d\n\nHassol said that the shift is simple. In the 2000s, she said, climate change wasn\u2019t yet at the level of an emergency. She recalls a 2009 report called \u201cThe Copenhagen Diagnosis,\u201d which analyzed climate science to date and made suggestions for how to reach net-zero carbon emissions. If world governments had acted swiftly, the world would have had to cut emissions only by a bit over 3 percent per year. \u201cWe called that the bunny slope,\u201d Hassol recalled.\n\nIf, on the other hand, governments waited until 2020 to start the transition, cuts would have to be much steeper \u2014 up to 9 percent per year. \u201cWe called that the double-black diamond,\u201d she said. Despite the brief respite in CO2 emissions during the pandemic, humanity\u2019s trajectory has veered closer to the double-black diamond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, many scientists realize that even the best communication in the world isn\u2019t enough to overcome the inertia of a system based on fossil fuels \u2014 and the resistance of various oil and gas companies.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not that scientists haven\u2019t been communicating clearly enough,\u201d Hassol said. \u201cWe communicated pretty darn clearly. Anyone who wanted to hear the message \u2014 it was there.\u201d"
