        "content": "TOKYO -- Political turbulence in the Red Sea is forcing global shippers to make more costly journeys and increasing pressure on companies to review their supply chains and prepare for a new norm characterized by longer transportation distances.\n\n\"The market will need to adjust to longer transit times. For everybody dependent on containerized trade, it means the supply chains have to adjust,\" said Peter Tirschwell, vice president for maritime & trade at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"It means planning has to be accelerated, the manufacturing has to be accelerated. It means a greater commitment of working capital to inventory.\""

        "content": "In a recent social media exchange, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, and John Deaton, a prominent pro-crypto lawyer representing XRP holders, engaged in a discussion that shed light on a crucial aspect of the legal landscape surrounding Ripple's ongoing battle with the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe focal point of their conversation was the significance of the 1994's Second Circuit case, Revak v. SEC Realty.\n\nGrewal, expressing his admiration for the case, highlighted a standout element that underscored the folly of defining an investment contract through an \"ecosystem\" access lens. Thus, Grewal emphasized the court's stance on the Howey test, stating that the mere tie between investor fortunes and promoter efforts does not easily satisfy the criteria. The court maintained that a common enterprise must be essentially dependent upon promoter expertise for the investments collectively to hinge on fortuity.\n\nWhen people brought up the district court ruling in @LBRYcom, my response, every time, was: read the 2nd Circuit Revak case. LBRY was a case governed by the 1st Circuit & the SG case. The @Ripple & @coinbase cases are governed by the 2nd Circuit & Revak. \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/tuUvX6iDME \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 28, 2024\n\nJohn Deaton, aligning with Grewal's perspective, drew parallels between the Revak case and the legal battles involving LBRY, Ripple and Coinbase. He specifically highlighted the jurisdictional nuances, noting that the Revak case, governed by the Second Circuit, holds relevance for the Ripple and Coinbase cases.\n\nRipple, Coinbase, SEC: Latest\n\nThe ongoing legal battles between the SEC and two prominent cryptocurrency companies, Ripple Labs and Coinbase, have significant implications for the future of the digital asset industry. As of latest, on Jan. 18, a federal judge ruled that the SEC could proceed with its lawsuit against Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the judge also narrowed the scope of the lawsuit, excluding several of the SEC's claims. This decision was seen as a partial victory for Coinbase, as it limits the potential legal liabilities the company faces.\n\nAs for Ripple, the SEC recently filed a motion to compel Ripple to produce additional internal documents related to the sale of XRP. This move suggests that the SEC is continuing to aggressively pursue its case against Ripple."

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nFrom the start, Ripple\u2019s legal team has leaned on the Revak v. SEC Realty case to support its stance against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), revealing the SEC\u2019s attempt to undermine cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a recent discussion, Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, and John Deaton, a prominent lawyer for XRP holders, chimed in on the critical aspects of Ripple\u2019s case, focusing on the 1994 Revak case.\n\nExpert Insight: Dismantling the SEC\u2019s Ecosystem Argument\n\nGrewal yet again brought up the Revak case and said that it showed how silly it is to look at an investment deal through the lens of \u201cecosystem\u201d access.\n\nHe reaffirmed the court\u2019s Howey test stance, saying that a simple link between investor wealth and promoter activities doesn\u2019t easily meet the requirements. The court must assert that a common enterprise must be essentially dependent on promoter expertise for investments to depend on luck.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s framework for digital asset analysis, found on its website, mentions that federal courts demand \u201chorizontal commonality\u201d or \u201cvertical commonality\u201d to fulfill the \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d aspect of the Howey test.\n\nHowever, the Commission itself doesn\u2019t explicitly require these commonalities and doesn\u2019t treat \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d as a separate element of an \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d\n\nJohn Deaton agreed with Grewal and said that the Revak case was similar to the ongoing legal fights between LBRY, Ripple, and Coinbase. He focused on the details of jurisdiction, pointing out how the Revak case, which was heard by the Second Circuit, was related to the Ripple and Coinbase cases.\n\nLooking at the current scenario, the SEC\u2019s legal battles with Ripple Labs and Coinbase carry significant implications for the digital asset right now.\n\nA recent ruling allowed the SEC to proceed with its lawsuit against Coinbase but narrowed its scope, seen as a partial victory for Coinbase. The SEC is contesting Ripple\u2019s dismissal, arguing that Ripple failed to show harm in producing recent financial statements.\n\nThe outcome could impact the XRP ecosystem, potentially opening doors for spot XRP ETFs with a positive resolution for Ripple. Meanwhile, Ripple\u2019s strategic hiring in institutional DeFi signals a move to expand its influence in the cryptocurrency ETF space."
