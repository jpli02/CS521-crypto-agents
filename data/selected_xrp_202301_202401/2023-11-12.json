        "title": "Horrifyingly Realistic Ripple Scam Emerges on Social Media - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nA new scam involving Ripple-affiliated XRP cryptocurrency has surfaced on social media platforms. The scam, alarmingly sophisticated in its execution, utilizes AI technology to imitate Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's voice and image, aiming to mislead users into believing in a non-existent XRP giveaway.\n\nNature of scam\n\nThe scam lures victims with a seemingly generous offer: Send a minimum of 1,000 XRP and receive double the amount in return.\n\nThe scam video features Garlinghouse promoting this fake giveaway. The video's voice, mimicking the Ripple boss in an extremely realistic manner, promises swift returns to those participating in this so-called community support initiative.\n\nHowever, eagle-eyed viewers have noticed discrepancies in the video's editing, particularly around the mouth movements, raising red flags about its authenticity.\n\nThis scam is part of a worrying trend of using AI to clone the voices of public figures. Similar tactics have been employed against other prominent individuals, including venture capitalist Tim Draper, a well-known Bitcoin enthusiast.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Draper recently warned the public about these AI voice cloning scams, stressing that he would never solicit funds in such a manner.\n\nRipple's legal action against YouTube\n\nXRP scams have been plaguing YouTube for years. Back in 2021, Garlinghouse took legal action against the popular video-hosting platform for allowing such scams to proliferate on its platform.\n\nUltimately, the case was settled, with both parties agreeing to work together to prevent such deceptive practices in the future.\n\nHowever, with the rise of AI-powered voice-cloning technologies, cryptocurrency scams continue to proliferate on social media platforms."

        "title": "Ripple Chief: SEC Could Be 'Thawing' Toward Crypto - PYMNTS.com",
        "content": "The CEO of Ripple says the SEC has stumbled in its investor protection duty.\n\n\u201cI think the SEC, in my opinion, has lost sight of their mission to protect investors,\u201d Brad Garlinghouse said of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an interview with CNBC published Saturday (Nov. 11). \u201cAnd the question is, who are they protecting in this journey?\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment when reached by PYMNTS.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that people talk about is, one of the definitions of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and thinking you\u2019ll get a different outcome, the SEC is doing the same thing over and over again,\u201d Garlinghouse added. \u201cAnd they think, I guess, they\u2019re gonna get a different outcome at some point.\u201d\n\nGarlinghouse is no stranger to tangling with the SEC, which sued Ripple and its executives in 2020 for securities law violations. The regulator accused Ripple of failing to register an ongoing offer and sale of billions of XRP tokens to investors.\n\nRipple won a crucial victory \u2014 for itself and the crypto sector as a whole \u2014 in July when a judge found that XRP is not a security. The ruling has \u201cfar-ranging repercussions across the digital asset ecosystem, which has long argued that its tokens do not represent securities contracts,\u201d PYMNTS wrote soon after.\n\nThe SEC later lost its bid to appeal that decision. Last month, the commission dropped its charges against Garlinghouse and fellow Ripple executive Chris Larsen, though its case against the company continues.\n\n\u201cI think it is a positive step for the industry, not just for Ripple, not just for Chris and Brad, but for the whole industry, that the SEC has been put in check in the United States,\u201d Garlinghouse said.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m hopeful this will be a thawing of the permafrost in the United States for really seeing an amazing industry that has immense potential to thrive in the largest economy in the world.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s attitude toward the crypto sector has previously caused Garlinghouse to say that the company was focusing on other jurisdictions for its hiring.\n\nInterviewed in September at the Token2049 conference in Singapore, he said Ripple plans to conduct 80% of its hiring from countries he argued are better at regulating cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super frustrating that you see markets like we have here in Singapore \u2026 where the governments are partnering with the industry, and you\u2019re seeing leadership providing clear rules, and you\u2019re seeing growth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd frankly that\u2019s why Ripple is hiring there.\u201d"

Trading Volumes Indicate Overlap: High daily trading volumes for the XRP-BTC pair on major exchanges like Bitstamp and Binance demonstrate significant overlapping interest among investors in both cryptocurrencies.\n\nWay back in February 2019, \u201cMastering Bitcoin\u201d author Andreas Antonopoulos claimed:\n\n\u201cPeople interested in XRP are not interested in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBackground: BTC vs. XRP\n\nThe two ultra-high market cap, blue chip cryptocurrencies have certainly competed for capital inflows and development. Back in those \u201cearly days\u201d of the burgeoning blockchain industry, so-called \u201cBitcoin Maxis\u201d said Ripple wasn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d blockchain. The XRP army called Bitcoin an outdated blockchain.\n\nMaxis claimed Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work consensus mechanism to secure an entirely P2P cash network makes BTC more secure than XRP. Meanwhile, the most zealous Ripple supporters criticized Bitcoin for being too energy-intensive and slower to make payments.\n\nBut is it really true anymore that Bitcoin and Ripple people really have nothing to do with each other? Here\u2019s what some of the data has to say.\n\nBitcoin Ripple Price Correlation: 0.84\n\nThe three-month Bitcoin Ripple price correlation coefficient is running at a hot 0.84, according to data from Macroaxis, a fintech analytics firm:\n\n\u201cThe correlation between historical prices or returns on Bitcoin and XRP is a relative statistical measure of the degree to which these equity instruments tend to move together[\u2026] Values of the correlation coefficient range from -1 to +1[\u2026]\u201d\n\nCompare that to the Bitcoin stocks correlation, which fell into negative territory after the S&P 500 Index dipped while Bitcoin and XRP prices rallied in October.\n\nMeanwhile, The XRP-BTC trading pair saw a daily volume Saturday of over 590,000 XRP on Bitstamp alone, according to TradingView data. On Binance, the XRP-BTC pair saw an even higher daily trading volume of 41.2 million XRP.\n\nIn addition to the high Bitcoin-Ripple price correlation, that\u2019s strong evidence that there is an overlap of interest in XRP and BTC among a sizable number of cryptocurrency traders today."
