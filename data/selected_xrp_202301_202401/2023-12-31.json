        "title": "\u201cRipple Effects\u201d Wins the 2023 Dwayne McDuffie Award for Diversity in Comics - Multiversity Comics",
        "content": "The winner of the eighth annual Dwayne McDuffie Award for Diversity in Comics was announced by Phil LaMarr in a presentation on The Beat\u2019s YouTube channel last night. This year\u2019s prize went to Jordan Hart and Bruno Chiroleu\u2019s 2022 miniseries \u201cRipple Effects\u201d (published by Fanbase Press), which tells the story of a diabetic superhero.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, writer Jordan Hart talked about how the series was inspired by his experience of being diagnosed with the blood clot disease thrombophilia, and by talking to other people with invisible disabilities, which made him feel less alone; he hoped the book would in turn remind others with similar conditions that they aren\u2019t alone either. Hart\u2019s win for the book, which was previously nominated for an Eisner and a Harvey Award, comes ahead of the release of his new series \u201cThe Cabinet\u201d (created with co-writer David Ebeltoft and artist Chiara Raimondi), which begins at Image in February.\n\nThe other four finalists this year were Lawrence Lindell\u2019s YA graphic novel \u201cBlackward,\u201d Rina Ayuyang\u2019s Filipino American noir \u201cThe Man in the McIntosh Suit\u201d (both published by Drawn & Quarterly), Frederick L. Jones and Issaka Galadima\u2019s manga-inspired \u201cClock Striker\u201d (Saturday AM), and A Wave Blue World\u2019s queer romance anthology \u201cYoung Men in Love\u201d (edited by Joe Glass and Matt Miner.)\n\nThis year\u2019s judges were led by Marv Wolfman, and consisted of Colleen Doran, Heidi MacDonald, Jamal Igle, Joseph Illidge, Nilah Magruder, Kevin Rubio, Geoffrey Thorne, Matt Wayne, and Will J. Watkins, the director of the award. Watkins stated, \u201cThis award in (Dwayne\u2019s) name, its significance, and impact, has never been more important. So what might Dwayne say in the midst of such unsettling times? I believe the same thing he\u2019s still saying through this award \u2014 he\u2019d encourage diverse creators that their art, their voices, and their lives do matter.\u201d\n\nMcDuffie\u2019s widow, Charlotte Fullerton, added, \u201cIt is my honor, through this award in my late husband\u2019s name, to shine a spotlight on outstanding diverse, inclusive content and creators. Dwayne always said he wanted to see \u2018all kinds of different stories being told by all kinds of different people.\u2019 Make him proud.\u201d You can donate to the Dwayne McDuffie Foundation via the organization\u2019s GoFundMe page, and the newly established McDuffie Genius Grant for his alma mater the Roeper School at the school\u2019s website (donations must be made specifically through the grant\u2019s designation.)"

        "content": "Entering the new year, Ripple\u2019s XRP is positioned uniquely within the cryptocurrency market. The digital asset has shown limited growth since the mid-November crash, resulting in a 19% decrease in its value. Despite the introduction of a new XRP trading pair on Binance Spot, external influences have not provided the necessary boost to propel Ripple forward. It is crucial to acknowledge, however, that XRP has not remained entirely stagnant, boasting an 80% surge over the past year.\n\nAs of the current moment, XRP is traded at $0.641082, reflecting a 3.5% daily increase. The burning question for investors is how high XRP can climb in January 2024, taking into account the prevailing market conditions and the trajectory it followed throughout 2023.\n\nXRP in 2023\n\nReflecting on 2023, technical analysis offers insights into the price range of XRP. The minimum cost stood at $0.630, with the expected maximum level reaching $0.688. Throughout the year, the average trading price was estimated to hover around $0.746.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple: Up 87% in 2023, How XRP Could Pass $1 in Early 2024\n\nXRP Outlook for January 2024\n\nIn January, XRP is projected to experience a trading range with a minimum cost of $0.637, a maximum trading cost reaching $0.821, and an average trading cost stabilizing around $0.729. These figures suggest a relatively narrow band of price fluctuations, indicating a cautious yet potentially optimistic outlook for XRP\u2019s performance in the coming month.\n\nWhile technical analysis lays the groundwork for predictions, it is crucial to consider broader factors influencing XRP\u2019s performance. Ripple, the entity behind XRP, is entangled in various legal battles, including an ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Developments in these legal proceedings could significantly impact XRP\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nFurthermore, regulatory changes and the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market play pivotal roles in shaping XRP\u2019s future. Collaborations, partnerships, and technological advancements within the Ripple ecosystem may also contribute to potential price movements.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple XRP Price Prediction: New Year 2024\n\nNavigating through a phase of relative stagnation, the January 2024 forecasts for XRP suggest modest expectations. Investors and enthusiasts are advised to monitor not only technical indicators but also external factors that could influence the market. Ripple\u2019s ability to overcome legal challenges and adapt to the evolving cryptocurrency landscape will likely determine whether XRP can break free from its current sluggish phase and experience more substantial growth in the months ahead."

Linderwell\u2019s family installed a reverse osmosis system when he was a child after high nitrate levels were found in their water. Now 26, he is the administrator responsible for private well testing in the county. (Nick Rohlman/The Gazette)\n\nThis is the final installment of a two-part series on 10 years of the Nutrient Reduction Strategy and its rippling impacts on Iowa\u2019s water quality. Read part one here, and an explainer about the strategy here.\n\nWhen Alex Linderwell was in high school, the pump for the private well in his family\u2019s Manchester home had to be replaced. They decided to test the water they\u2019d been drinking for years.\n\nLinderwell remembers it coming back with nitrate levels higher than the safe drinking water limit \u2014 which wasn\u2019t surprising, he said. Private wells in Delaware County, tucked in Northeast Iowa\u2019s karst region, are prone to contamination due to the area\u2019s porous geography and heavy agricultural presence. His family installed a reverse osmosis system to filter out the nutrient.\n\n\u201cI honestly didn't really give it much of a thought,\u201d he said. \u201cLittle did I know I would end up being the person that comes out to test well water.\u201d\n\nDelaware County water and sanitation department Administrator Alex Linderwell walks Nov. 29 near the Delhi Dam on the Maquoketa River in Delaware County. (Nick Rohlman/The Gazette)\n\nLinderwell, now 26, is the administrator of the Delaware County Water and Sanitation Department who is responsible for private well water testing. He has seen nitrate levels reach as high as 60 milligrams per liter \u2014 six times the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s safe drinking water level of 10 milligrams per liter.\n\nAround 27 percent of Delaware County\u2019s nitrate tests come back above 10 milligrams per liter. That\u2019s well above Iowa\u2019s average of elevated nitrate test results between 2011 and 2020, which is 15 percent, according to state data.\n\nNitrate levels above the safe drinking water limit can cause deadly blue baby syndrome in infants. Long-term exposure to lower nitrate levels, even for adults, could lead to cancer and other negative health impacts, emerging research suggests.\n\nThe Maquoketa River below the Delhi Dam in Delaware County, Iowa on Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2023.

(Nick Rohlman/The Gazette)\n\nIt represents one of the many consequences of Iowa\u2019s battle with nutrient pollution. Agrochemicals like fertilizer were responsible for 10 percent of the fish that died in Iowa fish kills since 1981, according to Investigate Midwest reporting. Those impacts multiply as nutrients from across the Mississippi River basin make their way down to the Gulf of Mexico Hypoxic \u2014 or dead \u2014 Zone. Nitrogen and phosphorous can also disrupt public water supplies, causing facilities like Des Moines Water Works to spend up to $10,000 a day operating nitrate removal technology\n\nFor the final installment of the Ripple Effects series, The Gazette interviewed water quality experts, government officials and advocacy groups to answer the question: After a decade of Iowa\u2019s Nutrient Reduction Strategy \u2014 after some successes and several challenges \u2014 where do we go from here?\n\nNitrogen pollution at stalemate\n\nWhile Iowa\u2019s modeled phosphorous load has shown improvements, the state has made negligible progress over the last decade in decreasing its nitrogen pollution, according to Iowa State University\u2019s Nutrient Reduction Strategy data dashboard.\n\nFive-year flow-weighted averages \u2014 which help smooth out the influence of rainfall or drought \u2014 of nitrate loads in 2021 were actually higher than those in 2012, a year before the strategy was implemented.\n\n\u201cWe're stable to a little bit behind our original starting point,\u201d said Jamie Benning, ISU\u2019s assistant director for agriculture and natural resources extension.\n\nShe partly attributes that to an increase in nitrogen fertilizer application. Fluctuating corn and soybean acreage within the past decade \u2014 largely influenced by policy changes \u2014 also contributes to nitrogen loads, especially when perennial land cover enrolled in the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Conservation Reserve Program shifts back to row crops.\n\nCorn yields have seen an upward trajectory in the past decades, which may encourage farmers to use even more fertilizer on their fields to maintain profits, added Matt Helmers, director of ISU\u2019s Nutrient Research Center. Many nitrogen-focused conservation practices, like saturated buffers and bioreactors, are also relatively new to the water quality scene. Practices that prevent soil loss, and thus the loss of sediment-bound phosphorous, have been around much longer.\n\n\u201cIt's really only the last 10 years that we've focused on nitrogen reduction, certainly in the same way that we've historically focused on sediment and phosphorus reduction,\u201d Helmers said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more to do.\u201d\n\nOne potential avenue toward cutting Iowa\u2019s nitrogen pollution could be ISU\u2019s Iowa Nitrogen Initiative \u2014 a study of nitrogen fertilizer application in search of best management practices that boost corn productivity while avoiding runoff. The project aims to revise a long-standing fertilizer calculator used in seven corn-growing states.\n\nThis summer, the university and its partners completed 270 on-farm trials on 148 fields between 72 farm operators. The trial results will be available in early 2024. They may uncover site-specific recommendations for farmers to reduce their fertilizer usage and resulting nutrient runoff.\n\nInvestments overshadow progress\n\nAny progress the Nutrient Reduction Strategy has made thus far has been slow-moving.\n\nIn a 2022 report, the Iowa Environmental Council calculated how long it would take Iowa to reach one of the strategy\u2019s example scenarios for nonpoint source nutrient reduction. Based on progress through 2018, the report authors found it would take 85 years to reach 12.6 million acres of using cover crops; 942 years to reach 7.7 million acres treated by wetlands; and 22,325 years to reach 6 million acres treated by bioreactor and saturated buffers.\n\n\u201cUltimately, a strategy has to be judged by the outcomes,\u201d said the council\u2019s water program director Alicia Vasto, \u201cand the outcomes are just not there.\u201d\n\nSnow covers a field Nov. 29 in Delaware County. Reducing 45 percent of nutrient pollution from about 27 million acres of row cropland \u2014 the Nutrient Reduction Strategy\u2019s goal \u2014 is a huge undertaking, one that will take time, said state geologist Keith Schilling. (Nick Rohlman/The Gazette)\n\nReducing 45 percent of nutrient pollution from about 27 million acres of row cropland \u2014 the strategy\u2019s goal \u2014 is a huge undertaking, one that will take time, said state geologist Keith Schilling.\n\n\u201cAnybody that sees this strategy and understands its background will never say that it was a one-shot deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was always a process, and people can debate the time needed for this process to happen, but it is definitely a long time.\u201d\n\nWith the amount of investment already funneled into the Nutrient Reduction Strategy, critics say the progress to date is not enough.\n\nIn 2021 alone, federal conservation funding granted to Iowa through USDA programs surpassed $467 million; the ag department\u2019s Conservation Reserve Program for converting cropland to perennial cover represented the bulk, at $382.5 million. Farmer and landowner investments into conservation practices through public sector programs reached $38 million. Other public sector funding dedicated to the strategy\u2019s water quality goals reached $195 million.\n\n\u201cI think the lag is reasonable, but you'd like to think that over this 10-year period, we'd have seen something beyond static,\u201d said David Cwiertny, director of the Center for Health Effects of Environmental Contamination at the University of Iowa. \u201cWe don't have the indicators that are necessary for folks to say, \u2018OK, we feel like we're getting a return on the investment we're putting into those practices.\u2019\u201d\n\nResearchers advocated for more water quality monitoring to track Iowa\u2019s progress toward its water quality goals. Earlier this year, the Iowa Legislature cut funding allocated for the UI\u2019s network of sensors that measure water quality across state waterways. ISU stepped in to offer needed but reduced financial support.\n\nSeveral experts told The Gazette the lack of tangible benchmarks in the Nutrient Reduction Strategy makes it difficult to hold Iowa accountable for its water quality goals. In comparison, both Illinois and Minnesota have mapped timelines for their strategies.\n\n\u201cThere's no teeth here at all. It's just one big suggestion with no real goals, timelines or deliverables,\u201d Schilling said. \u201cBut it was written to be that. It was not written to be this mandated principle. \u2026 You\u2019d be assigning modern or new ideas to something that was never part of that.\u201d\n\nIs more regulation the answer?\n\nThe Nutrient Reduction Strategy spelled out stricter regulations for point sources like wastewater treatment facilities. Those entities are slowly making their way toward nutrient load reductions.\n\nBut, regardless of reaching their goals under the strategy, they don\u2019t account for even half of the nutrient pollution Iowa is facing. That comes from nonpoint sources \u2014 primarily agriculture and livestock \u2014 that face voluntary measures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve wrung every last ounce of pollution reduction out of point source discharges like municipalities. They're permitted, and we can then enforce reductions,\u201d Cwiertny said. \u201cThe challenge are the voluntary practices for nonpoint source pollution.\u201d\n\nOne option is to regulate nonpoint sources.\n\nFor example, Iowa could put restrictions on what flood plains farmers can farm in. Some flood every two years on average. That means nutrients \u2014 and crops \u2014 are washing away every two years, damaging the farmer\u2019s bottom line and the surrounding water quality. Marginal land that\u2019s already not profitable could be taken out of production. The state could make certain conservation practices mandatory, like saturated buffers. It could also regulation when and how much fertilizer is applied to fields.\n\nJust like for point sources, though, regulations for nonpoint sources would require enforcement. That demands more funding, time and resources for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources \u2014 the state\u2019s regulatory body overseeing state and federal laws that protect air, land and water.\n\n\u201cWhen you make something mandatory, there's still the process of verifying that it's happening. \u2026 It's not an uncomplicated process either,\u201d Benning said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a magic wand and poof, everything gets better. There's different complications.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s very little, if any, political will to pursue regulations for nonpoint sources because of potential blowback from political funders. Major agricultural companies donated about $500,000 to political candidates ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and the Iowa Farm Bureau donated more than $330,000, according to Investigate Midwest reporting.\n\n\u201cI've viewed a lot of the strategy as a big rope-a-dope strategy for agricultural interests,\u201d Schilling said. \u201cWe've delayed any sort of conversation here probably by a generation.\u201d\n\nSystemic challenges within agriculture\n\nDan Voss drives Nov. 8 near his land outside of Palo. Voss has implemented conservation practices on his land since the 1980s and was named the 2023 Conservation Farmer of the Year by the Iowa Farm Bureau. (Nick Rohlman/The Gazette)\n\nIn November, Dan Voss geared up to plant camelina \u2014 a cover crop \u2014 across some of his 600-acre farm near Palo. It\u2019s a conservation practice he has dutifully adhered to since the 1980s, along with no-till. He already has one saturated buffer and one bioreactor on his land. By the end of 2024, he\u2019s hoping for two more bioreactors and three more saturated buffers.\n\nIt\u2019s those conservation actions that led to his accolade as the Iowa Farm Bureau\u2019s 2023 Iowa Conservation Farmer of the Year.\n\n\u201cIt's a win-win for farmers. Shoot, it doesn't cost them anything,\u201d Voss said about conservation practices, like his own, that were completed within strategic patchworks of conservation practices called \u201cbatch and build\u201d initiatives that aim to improve water quality in bulk. \u201cWe really can make progress, and we can reduce the dead zone. \u2026 The agriculture community, we need to get with it.\u201d\n\nDan Voss plants cover crops on his land near Palo, Iowa on Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2023.

Voss has implemented conservation practices on his land since the 1980s. (Nick Rohlman/The Gazette)\n\nWithin the current structure of the Nutrient Reduction Strategy, the only way to make it more successful is to accelerate the rate of voluntary adoption for conservation practices. Doing that within the confines of Iowa\u2019s agricultural industry is difficult, said J. Arbuckle, an ISU rural sociologist who runs the Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll.\n\nToday\u2019s farmers are exceedingly dependent on purchased inputs, he said, a growing trend over the last few decades as farming practices advance and grant larger yields than ever before. The Gazette previously reported that Iowa farmers bought 4.94 million metric tons of fertilizer from July 1, 2022, through June 30 \u2014 down 6 percent from the previous year, but 10 percent higher than the 10-year average.\n\nNot only do these increased inputs lead to outsized impacts on water quality, but their costs also deplete farmers\u2019 bottom lines: Even if their yields are up, their overall profit decreases with every pound of fertilizer purchased.\n\n\u201cIt's really systemic, and it's really hard to just jump out of it,\u201d Arbuckle said. He recommended farmers shift their mindsets from chasing higher yields to chasing higher profits, which conservation practices can help with. \u201cIf everybody were chasing profits, and trying to reduce the amount that they're spending on external inputs, everybody would be better off.\u201d\n\nMore than three-fourths of farmers responding to his 2014 Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll said they were concerned about agriculture\u2019s impact on Iowa\u2019s water quality, and 84 percent agreed that farmers should do more to reduce nutrient and sediment runoff into waterways. Yet almost half of the farmers reported they were only slightly or not at all knowledgeable about the Nutrient Reduction Strategy at that time.\n\nIn the 2023 Farm Poll, 64 percent of rental farmer respondents indicated that their landlord had not spent any money on conservation practices for their largest parcel of land over the previous 10 years. Fifty-seven percent of renters reported spending some amount of their own money on such practices in the same time frame, and most agreed it was their responsibility to address conservation needs on the land they rent.\n\n\u201cWe're moving in the right direction in terms of awareness, knowledge and then adoption of practices,\u201d Arbuckle said. \u201cIt's just that we're going much more slowly than that we would like (in order) to actually make the types of progress that we would like.\u201d\n\nBrittney J.
