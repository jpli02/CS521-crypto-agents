Red and white jerseys flashed all around the field at the Ford Center at The Star.\n\nIt was chaos until the North\u2019s Alex Cutone (Boston U) knocked the ball loose one final time, allowing her side to wind down the clock and come away victorious, 14-13. In a game that featured 27 goals, it was those closing moments that MVP Olivia Ripple (Denver) enjoyed the most.\n\n\u201cThe back and forth at the end, everything rushing through your mind, just knowing that you have to get the ball, you have to get the last possession,\u201d Ripple said. \u201cAnything can happen. And it was just a really great moment to be able to spend with the team.\u201d\n\nIn the yearly gathering of the best college-bound girls\u2019 lacrosse players, Ripple notched a game-high four goals in the high-scoring showcase.\n\nRipple was the first on the scoreboard, converting her first of three free-position attempts. The North led 3-0 early thanks to scores from Ripple, Madi Smith (Northwestern) and Kathleen Michaud (Cal Berkley).\n\nSmith \u2014 one of a handful of Ripple\u2019s longtime teammates on the STEPS California club team \u2014 was a force throughout the game, too. Along with a goal and an assist, she took on the bulk of draw controls, played solid defense and won the halftime shot contest, slinging two 82-mile-per-hour shots.\n\nSmith took part in the most memorable goal of the contest, setting up Adele Atherton (Brown) \u2014 another STEPS California player \u2014 for a back-handed twizzler at the end of the first half. Smith will join her sister Samantha Smith, the 2021 Adrenaline All-American MVP, at Northwestern in the fall."

        "content": "BROAD RIPPLE \u2014 After recent efforts to improve safety in Broad Ripple, numerous bars and businesses are now reverting back to regular business hours, citing financial concerns.\n\nThe city and Village Association announced safety upgrades less than a month ago, which included some bars closing at 1 a-m.\n\nBut many businesses, like Goodfellas Pizza, which sits at the heart of bars and restaurants in Broad Ripple, say that early closure has hurt them financially.\n\n\"We do pizza by the slice, big pies all New York style,\" said Shift Lead Cole Mcelroy.\n\nGoodfellas is open from 11 a.m. to midnight Sunday through Thursday, right now. They were open until 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday's until the Broad Ripple Village Association announced businesses would close at 1 a.m. following a deadly shooting in late June.\n\nShift manager, Cole Mcelroy says, closing early had a major impact on them, both financially and for their employees.\n\n\"It was taking hours away from our late-night crew, which was just really unfortunate and sad for them, because that is cutting out of their paycheck and it's also kind of out of our businesses pay as well. We definitely took a pretty big hit for a while, but we're still here. We're still ready to get things to go back to normal,\" he said.\n\nNow, several establishments throughout Broad Ripple tell WRTV they're going back to closing at normal business hours.\n\nFor some it's 2 a.m. For others, it's 3 a.m.\n\n\"It's gonna be lovely for our business. We mainly cater to the late-night crew, especially, especially on Fridays, and Saturdays since we're open till three and we are one of the only places serving food,\"Mcelroy said. \"Now that we're actually able to go back to that we're gonna be able to help a lot more people.\"\n\nThe Broad Ripple Village Association says bars are working to put public safety first and balance running their business.\n\nNo public comment will be made.\n\nThe city says, \"it continues to work with businesses and the Broad Ripple Village Association, using the tools available, to keep the area safe and welcoming.\"\n\nThat includes barricades in the former troubled Broad Ripple Station parking lot, more lighting, cameras and police presence.\n\n\"I like what they're doing. they're creating an environment where it's safe. It's like downtown on Georgia Street,\" said visitor Dave Smith.\n\nMcelroy is hoping the trouble makers will stay home, but encourages those wanting to have a good time to support their business.\n\n\"I hope the lines are packed out the door from you know, 10 to 3 in the morning. I really would just appreciate everyone coming out and supporting us,\" he said.\n\nIMPD says it hasn't had any trouble with Broad Ripple since the safety upgrades were made three weeks ago.\n\nIt's continuing to work with businesses and the community."

        "title": "Blockchain-based cross-border payments \u2013 the Ripple effect - TechHQ",
        "content": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nCompanies researching the best way to receive international payments in 2023 soon discover that they have no shortage of options for accepting foreign currency from customers overseas. And that includes blockchain-based cross-border payment solutions such as Ripple. The US tech firm has long been on a mission to \u2018build breakthrough crypto solutions for a world without economic borders\u2019 \u2013 but how do blockchain-based cross-border payments work and should your organization use them?\n\nMaking overseas payments using traditional banking systems means lining up multiple intermediaries between the payer and the beneficiary. And with each link in the chain taking a fee for enabling the transaction, the cost of international payments adds up. Plus, those transfers can be delayed if cross-border payment requests happen to coincide with a weekend or bank holiday. Also, the pre-funding of overseas accounts locks up working capital.\n\nRipple\u2019s blockchain-based cross-border payments, on the other hand, promise settlement in seconds, not days. And transaction fees are kept low by removing no-longer-needed intermediaries from the equation to give customers competitive last-mile payment rates.\n\nHow does Ripple work?\n\nRipple\u2019s solutions are built using the XRP Ledger, which is a blockchain for IOUs and enables transactions between different payment types. The digital ledger has a number of features that make it attractive to fintech providers looking to modernize financial services, including on-chain escrow that can gate XRP and release it once payment settlement conditions have been met.\n\nUsing XRP as a digital intermediatory, Ripple cross-border payment settlement is active in more than 50 countries, allowing users to send a variety of currencies using the blockchain-enabled system. Senders receive a fiat-to-fiat quote on pricing and FX, and beneficiaries can be paid out immediately in the chosen currency.\n\nRipple is an interesting case study on how fintech providers are using blockchain to modernize the provision of financial services. Rather than compete against traditional banks, Ripple is reaching out to them \u2013 offering its digital currency payment rails as a high-speed, more efficient alternative to legacy systems such as SWIFT.\n\nRipple vs SWIFT\n\nSWIFT, a global member-owned cooperative that specializes in secure financial messaging services, connects more than 11,000 banking and securities organizations. And the Belgium-headquartered organization has customers in more than 200 countries, putting it ahead of Ripple.\n\nREAD NEXT Quantum computing in finance: steampunk chandeliers have their uses\n\nBut announcements by SWIFT, such as a successful experiment to move tokenized assets using its infrastructure, show that even dominant players are having to adapt to a financial future that could be increasingly blockchain-based.\n\nA common criticism of cryptocurrencies has been their energy demands, with Bitcoin miners propping up the profits of energy companies and chip makers. A switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake shrinks this carbon footprint by reducing the computing demands of running a digital ledger. Rather than mining for cryptocurrency, users can earn rewards by staking their cryptocurrency to participate in the consensus mechanism of the blockchain.\n\nThe safety net comes from the idea that stakeholders won\u2019t want to jeopardize their locked-up cryptocurrency by attempting to add invalid blocks to the chain. But there are fears that proof-of-stake networks could become centralized if a large amount of cryptocurrency is controlled by just a few actors.\n\n\n\nThe XRP ledger, which underpins Ripple, gets around this by adopting a different method of coming to consensus on adding blockchain entries. XRP makes use of a so-called federated byzantine agreement, which relies on validators overlapping in their endorsement of yet-to-be-added transactions. For example, if 80% of validators agree on adding a block to the chain then those details are assumed to be trusted.\n\nAnd nodes carry their own unique node lists (UNLs) of validators, which they believe provide reliable information \u2013 removing them if they keep failing to reach consensus. Overlap between UNLs provides continuity across the community, with the XRP Ledger gravitating towards proven validators and shying away from untrusted nodes. But there could be a catch.\n\nREAD NEXT Enterprise blockchain: digital payment rails on track\n\nA study by researchers at KAIST in South Korea on Stellar \u2013 a cryptocurrency that also operates using the federated byzantine agreement method of reaching consensus \u2013 showed that, rather than encouraging decentralization, the approach can bake in dependences on certain key nodes.\n\n\u201cWe show that all of the nodes in Stellar cannot run SCP [Stellar Consensus Protocol] if only two nodes fail,\u201d writes the KAIST team in its paper. \u201cTo make matters worse, these two nodes are run and controlled by a single organization, the Stellar Foundation.\u201d\n\nAnd like Stellar, Ripple operates its own validators, which could be problematic if those nodes form the dominant link between the various UNLs. Also, blockchains aren\u2019t bulletproof and exhibit residual failure modes \u2013 something that David Schwartz, Chief Technical Officer at Ripple, admits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we continue to innovate to reduce the odds of them happening and reduce their severity even if it is a bit embarrassing for the industry to point the finger at these failure modes,\u201d he commented at Apex \u2013 the XRPL developer summit, in a talk on the continuous evolution of the XRP Ledger.\n\nRipple's latest report let this sink in.. 250 trillion by 2027 in cross-border payments alone. \ud83e\udd2f#XRP pic.twitter.com/2SCe8h8ZnV \u2014 RIZ.XRP \u2600\ufe0f (@RizXRP) July 19, 2023\n\nIn Ripple\u2019s case, the ledger could halt its forward progress if too many validators fail before humans can respond to the issue. And, as Schwartz points out, the goal is to have ledgers that offer maximum reliability. Hence, it\u2019s why developers are working on solutions such as Negative UNL \u2013 a feature of the XRP Ledger consensus protocol designed to improve \u2018liveness\u2019.\n\n\u201cUsing the Negative UNL, servers adjust their effective UNLs based on which validators are currently online and operational, so that a new ledger version can be declared validated even if several trusted validators are offline,\u201d explains the latest XRP Ledger documentation.\n\nGiven the rollercoaster ride that cryptocurrencies have been on lately, it\u2019s promising to see fintech firms being transparent about potential weaknesses. And if these are signs of blockchain developers building firm and well-tested foundations, digital ledger projects may live up to the hype after all."

        "title": "Defining Digital Asset Securities: US District Court Issues Summary Judgment Rulings in SEC v. Ripple Labs - Mayer Brown",
        "content": "For the past several years, many have viewed \u201cSEC v. Ripple\u201d as one of the defining conflicts in the US crypto regulatory landscape. At the heart of this dispute is the question of whether digital tokens are \u201csecurities\u201d for US securities law purposes. In a closely-watched ruling, on July 13, 2023 the US federal court hearing the case ruled on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment and made several key determinations on this question. While the Court\u2019s decision provides a number of meaningful rulings, it leaves many questions unanswered and will not be the final chapter in this long-running dispute. Among the important findings are the Court\u2019s holdings that:\n\nIn the words of the Court, \u201cXRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a contract, transaction[,] or scheme that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract.\u201d 1\n\nRipple\u2019s contractual sales of XRP to direct counterparties, due to Ripple\u2019s communications, marketing campaigns, and the stipulations built into the contracts themselves, constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. 2\n\nSales of XRP by Ripple and its former and current CEOs on digital asset exchanges did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts because the buyers did not derive an expectation of profit from Ripple\u2019s efforts, among other factors. Notably, however, the Court declined to address the question of whether secondary market sales of XRP constitute offers and sales of investment contracts, because that analysis would depend on \u201cthe totality of circumstances and the economic reality of that specific contract, transaction, or scheme.\u201d\n\nIn this Legal Update, we will recap the long history of this dispute, analyze the Court\u2019s rulings and describe what the Court\u2019s decision means for digital assets in the United States.\n\nBackground\n\nXRP, and the electronically distributed ledger (or \u201cblockchain\u201d) on which it runs, was founded in 2012 as a faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient alternative to the bitcoin blockchain.3 XRP is the native digital token of the XRP Ledger, and actions performed on the XRP Ledger require XRP in order to be completed.4 Ripple (formerly known as both NewCoin, Inc. and OpenCoin, Inc.) was created by Larsen and two other founders in order to develop and promote the XRP Ledger, with the goal of \u201cmoderniz[ing] international payments by developing a global payments network for international currency transfers.\u201d5 Ripple was originally funded with 80 billion XRP (i.e., four-fifths of the total XRP supply), and, at all times prior to the end of 2020, held between 50 and 80 billion XRP.6\n\nBetween 2013 and 2020, Ripple, along with Christian Larsen and Bradley Garlinghouse (its former and current CEOs, respectively) in their respective roles as CEO of Ripple, engaged in sales and distributions of XRP pursuant to written contracts (\u201cInstitutional Sales\u201d) and through digital asset exchanges (\u201cProgrammatic Sales\u201d), and used XRP as a form of payment for services rendered by Ripple\u2019s employees and third party companies seeking to develop new applications for XRP and the XRP Ledger (i.e., the \u201cOther Distributions\u201d).7 Ripple and its senior leaders, including Larsen and Garlinghouse, frequently promoted or marketed the advantages of the XRP Ledger throughout this period, including via brochures, quarterly \u201cXRP Market Reports,\u201d interviews as well as through posts on social media platforms.8\n\nThe SEC filed claims against Ripple, Larsen and Garlinghouse (each a \u201cDefendant\u201d and collectively, the \u201cDefendants\u201d) on December 22, 2020 in federal court in the Southern District of New York, alleging that each Defendant\u2019s sales of XRP constituted the unlawful offer and sale of securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77e(a) and (c).9 The SEC also alleged that both Garlinghouse and Larsen aided and abetted Ripple\u2019s Section 5 violations.10 The parties each moved for summary judgment on September 13, 2022.11\n\nSection 5 of the Securities Act makes it unlawful for any person to directly or indirectly offer to sell or purchase a \u201csecurity\u201d in interstate commerce that has not registered with the SEC.12 The Defendants acknowledged that they did not file a registration statement with the SEC relating to the offer and sale of XRP. As a result, the Court\u2019s decision focuses entirely on whether Defendants\u2019 sales of XRP constituted sales of securities.13 The SEC alleged that Defendants marketed and sold XRP as an \u201cinvestment contract,\u201d which would constitute a \u201csecurity\u201d as the term is defined under the Securities Act.14 The Supreme Court set out the hallmark test for determining whether an instrument constitutes an investment contract in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., determining that a contract, transaction or investment is an investment contract where \u201ca person [(1)] invests his money [(2)] in a common enterprise and [(3)] is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\u201d15\n\nKey Aspects of the Summary Judgment Ruling\n\nDigital Assets as investment contracts. Much like the citrus groves in Howey, the Court noted that sales of XRP would constitute the sale of investment contracts if the totality of the circumstances indicate that they satisfied the Howey test. 16 That is, the totality of circumstances surrounding the different transactions and schemes involving the sale and distribution of XRP are critical to determining whether XRP is an investment contract, as \u201cXRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a \u2018contract, transaction[,] or scheme\u2019 that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract.\u201d 17\n\nMuch like the citrus groves in Howey, the Court noted that sales of XRP would constitute the sale of investment contracts if the totality of the circumstances indicate that they satisfied the Howey test.

The Court found that Ripple\u2019s Institutional Sales of XRP, in each case conducted via written contracts to sophisticated individuals or entities, constituted the offer and sale of investment contracts under Howey. Ripple received money, and pooled such money into commonly-controlled accounts, in exchange for XRP. Ripple executives consistently marketed both the value of the payments industry they were trying to capture, as well as how their efforts were directly correlated with putting \u201cupward pressure on XRP\u2019s price.\u201d 18 Contracts governing Institutional Sales also often limited buyer\u2019s conduct through obligations such as lockup provisions, resale restrictions based on XRP\u2019s trading volume, indemnification provisions, or even express disclaimers that the buyer was purchasing XRP \u201csolely to resell or otherwise distribute . . . and not to use [XRP] as an [e]nd [u]ser or for any other purpose.\u201d 19 The Court found that these facts were sufficient to support a finding that direct contracts for the purchase of XRP were entered into by institutional buyers as speculative investments in the future value of XRP, and ruled in favor of the SEC that Institutional Sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. 20\n\nThe Court found that Ripple\u2019s Institutional Sales of XRP, in each case conducted via written contracts to sophisticated individuals or entities, constituted the offer and sale of investment contracts under Howey.

Exchange-based sales. Even when taking Defendants\u2019 public statements about price movements into account, the Court rejected the SEC\u2019s argument that Programmatic Sales to public buyers on digital asset exchanges constituted the offer and sale of investment contracts. In particular, the Court held that the third Howey prong\u2014requiring that an investment be made with the expectation to profit from the efforts of another\u2014could not be met where purchasers of XRP could not have known whom they were transacting with when purchasing XRP from digital asset exchanges. The Court underscored that active speculation by buyers on future price movements of XRP, much like active speculation in the future value of other goods like horses or automobiles, \u201cdoes not evidence the existence of an \u2018investment contract\u2019 within the meaning for the [Securities Act]\u201d because \u201cthe expected return is not contingent upon the continuing efforts of another.\u201d 21 Programmatic buyers were also distinguished from their institutional counterparts; while Institutional Sales were conducted with sophisticated entities including institutional investors and hedge funds, who were targeted by direct marketing efforts and contractually bound to restrictions on their use of XRP, Programmatic buyers were generally \u201cless sophisticated,\u201d were not the recipients of direct marketing and had no way to know whether they were purchasing from Ripple or some other counterparty. 22\n\nEven when taking Defendants\u2019 public statements about price movements into account, the Court rejected the SEC\u2019s argument that Programmatic Sales to public buyers on digital asset exchanges constituted the offer and sale of investment contracts.

Distributions for consideration other than cash. The Court broadly held that distributions of XRP to employees or to third-party entities in exchange for their efforts to benefit XRP and the XRP Ledger failed the first prong of the Howey test and did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts because Defendants did not receive a payment of money or \u201csome tangible and definable consideration\u201d in exchange for the distributions. 23\n\nThe Court broadly held that distributions of XRP to employees or to third-party entities in exchange for their efforts to benefit XRP and the XRP Ledger failed the first prong of the Howey test and did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts because Defendants did not receive a payment of money or \u201csome tangible and definable consideration\u201d in exchange for the distributions. Sales by Executives on digital asset exchanges. Consistent with its finding regarding Programmatic Sales, the Court held that Larsen and Garlinghouse\u2019s sales of XRP\u2014in each case occurring on various digital asset exchanges through blind bid/ask transactions\u2014did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts because neither Defendant knew to whom they sold XRP, and no buyer knew that Defendants were the ones selling their tokens.24\n\nTakeaways\n\nWhile this has been one of the most high-profile enforcement actions alleging that the sale or trading of certain digital assets constitutes a violation of Section 5, it is one of many that remain ongoing. Importantly, the Court\u2019s decision does not bind other courts that are examining other digital assets or sets of facts to rule in the same manner. Nonetheless, this decision provides some useful guidance regarding how courts may consider offers and sales of digital assets as well as secondary transactions in digital assets. To that end, market participants may want to consider the following:\n\nThe decision is unlikely to deter the SEC in its pending enforcement actions or cause it to change its approach to digital tokens. The SEC will likely look to the parts of the Court decision that are in its favor to validate its continued views on the regulatory status of digital tokens.\n\nThe portions of the decision that are in Ripple\u2019s favor are fairly fact-specific, and while there may be others similarly situated in the market, some others in the marketplace may find it challenging to rely on those portions of the decision if their circumstances do not directly align.\n\nDirect (or \u201cprimary\u201d) token sales made to investors will have to surmount several hurdles in order to avoid running afoul of Howey. While the Court did not provide guidelines on when primary sales should not constitute sales of investment contracts, the decision clearly limits founders\u2019 ability to engage in pre-offering token sales (which often feature lock-up periods and may occur prior to the time at which the tokens could be used for anything but speculative investing). Protocols should be mindful of the product-stage at which they choose to make private token offerings, any representations they make in connection with such offerings, and any restrictions they contractually place on the use of such tokens.\n\n\u201cBlind\u201d or anonymous token sales (\u201csecondary sales\u201d) conducted via digital asset exchanges (as opposed to launch pads 25 or other transactions where the founding protocol is clearly selling the tokens) may not constitute the sale of investment contracts, subject to an assessment of the marketing efforts and communications relating to such secondary sales. One aspect that remains unclear is how protocols should properly fund exchanges or market makers with tokens in the first instance, particularly due to the Court\u2019s analysis regarding direct contractual, or primary, sales.\n\nor other transactions where the founding protocol is clearly selling the tokens) may not constitute the sale of investment contracts, subject to an assessment of the marketing efforts and communications relating to such secondary sales.

Distributions of tokens to employees as compensation for their efforts, or from foundations to third party companies to support development on a protocol, were found by the Court, in this instance, not to constitute investment contracts so long as they did not include \u201csome tangible and definable consideration.\u201d It is not clear from the Court\u2019s ruling what might meet this standard; while it does not seem likely that task-based compensation (i.e., providing token payments or rewards for executing discrete tasks) would be sufficiently \u201cdefinable,\u201d protocols should be cautious of receiving any tangible assets (such as other tokens or currency) in exchange for any token distributions they issue.\n\nWhile questions may abound with respect to tokens generally under the Howey test, the Court\u2019s ruling does not impact the status of a cryptocurrency token as a \u201ccommodity\u201d under the Commodity Exchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d), as administered by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d).26 Irrespective of whether a token is a security, such cryptocurrency token remains a commodity under the CEA, which permits the CFTC to prosecute fraud and manipulative conduct in the spot and derivatives crypto markets.\n\n1 SEC v.

These sales may be funded by tokens from the emerging protocols themselves, and are typically offered to purchasers in a variety of different sale or auction formats. As no third party market exists for the token at the time of the launch pad sale, users may infer that any purchases are being made directly from the emerging protocol.\n\n26 See In the Matter of Coinflip, Inc. d/b/d Derivabit, and Francisco Riordan, CFTC Docket No. 15-29 (Sept. 17, 2015).
