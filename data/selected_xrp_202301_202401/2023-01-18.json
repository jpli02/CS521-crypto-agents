        "content": "Ripple Lab\u2019s top lawyer is warning that the decision in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) lawsuit against the company will greatly impact the future of crypto in the US.\n\nResponding to an article by Bloomberg about how the lawsuit will impact regulatory jurisdiction, Ripple general counsel and crypto legal expert Stuart Alderoty says that the suit\u2019s conclusion will exert influence on how crypto assets are regulated in the US.\n\n\u201cNo matter how you dissect it, the experts agree \u2013 the outcome of the Ripple case will likely have a significant impact on crypto\u2019s future in the US.\u201d\n\nAlderoty also aims to debunk the myth that prominent figures within the crypto industry are against regulations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that actors in the crypto space do not want regulation, and I think responsible actors in the crypto space actually do want regulation. The reason they want regulation [is because] it\u2019s good for their business, it\u2019s good for their customers, it\u2019s good for the markets, and the way you get there is through clear regulation.\n\nClear regulations, consistently applied, lead to predictable outcomes and predictable outcomes are good for everybody. If you don\u2019t know what the law requires, you can\u2019t comply with the law. And the law inconsistently applied leads to unpredictable outcomes.\u201d\n\nRecently, Alderoty predicted that the SEC lawsuit will conclude in the first half of 2023 in a way that favors Ripple. The SEC originally sued Ripple in December 2020 on allegations that the firm sold XRP as an unregistered security.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ripple Manipulating The XRP Price? Researcher Finds Evidence - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The relationship between Ripple Labs and XRP tokens has been a controversial topic in the crypto community for quite some time. While there is evidence through older documents that XRP was also called Ripple in the past, since the XRP initiative in 2018, the company has placed great emphasis on the fact that the cryptocurrency is called XRP.\n\nIn particular, the company\u2019s huge XRP holdings in escrow accounts have been the focus of controversy. As of December 2017, Ripple created 55 escrow accounts, each holding 1 billion XRP. More than five years later, as of January 2023, the company still owns 43.3 billion XRP of all 100 billion pre-mined XRP.\n\nWhile Ripple created the escrow accounts to provide transparency and also publishes quarterly reports, a Twitter researcher named \u201cMr. Huber\u201d has made a \u2018finding\u2018 that sheds light on a different angle on Ripple\u2019s impact on the XRP price.\n\nIs Ripple Intentionally Influencing The XRP Price?\n\nIn an update on the company\u2019s trading of XRP yesterday, the researcher wrote that the company bought the dump at New Year with unusually high volume and is currently selling it with unusually high volume:\n\nRemember the dump at the New Year? Turns out, Ripple bought the dump with unusually high volume and is now selling again with unusually high volume. What could be the reason? Pure speculation.\n\nThe data the researcher refers to come from the official API. \u201cThat\u2019s how transparent they are. You don\u2019t have to wait for the quarterly reports, you can get the weekly data from their API,\u201d Mr. Huber explained.\n\nRemarkably, the company is selling four times more XRP at the moment than it has on average over the last two years.\n\nThe researcher first published his investigation on Twitter back at the end of October last year. At the time, he wrote that he was surprised that no one has taken a closer look at the company\u2019s XRP holdings that do not go back into the escrows.\n\nOn October 23, Mr. Huber shared the chart below, showing the supply of XRP separated into distributed supply, escrowed, and undistributed supply. Red shows the fintech\u2019s liquid XRP holdings. According to the researcher, they have been steadily decreasing since November 2020 until there was a reversal in September 2022.\n\nThe dataset since the beginning of 2022 revealed that the escrow holdings were getting smaller while the non-distributed supply was getting bigger. \u201cAt the red line you can see very well when Ripple sells and buys back. Ripple is now buying back,\u201d the researcher wrote at the end of October.\n\nAn XRP community member asked the researcher in October if he believes XRP is actually inflated by the buybacks. Huber replied:\n\nRipple is very transparent about how many tokens it holds. But exactly how Ripple calculates that wasn\u2019t clear. Apparently XRP that Ripple buys back are considered \u2018non-circulating\u2019. I have now discovered that you can use the API to track how much XRP Ripple is selling and buying.\n\nAs Huber explained, the reasons can only be speculated. Nevertheless, he wrote:\n\nNow I think about it, what Ripple is basically doing is trying to keep the price as stable as possible.\n\nIn October, Huber suggested that the buys were related to the purchases of XRP on the secondary market. \u201cIt is exactly this! Ripple bought back about half a billion XRP since September! That\u2019s probably why the price increased and why the circulating supply decreased though more XRP was released from escrow!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s What The Latest Quarterly Report Says\n\nThis is backed by the latest quarterly report (Q3 2022), in which the company wrote that it has been a buyer of XRP in the secondary market and expects to continue buying as On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) continues to gain global momentum.\n\nIn Q3 2022, Ripple\u2019s total XRP sales, net of purchases, were $310.68 million, down from $408.90 million in the previous quarter. The company emphasized that it continues to sell XRP only in conjunction with ODL transactions.\n\nIn addition, it said that it has not conducted any programmatic sales (since Q4 2019) and \u201chas no plans to do so going forward.\u201d\n\nAt press time, the XRP price traded at $0.3879.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "watch now\n\nThe head of cryptocurrency and blockchain company Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse says he is hopeful a resolution will be reached in its spat with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission within the first half of 2023. \"Judges take however long the judges will take,\" Garlinghouse, who is a defendant in the legal drama, said in an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"We're optimistic that this will certainly be resolved in 2023, and maybe [in] the first half. So we'll see how it plays out from here. But I feel very good about where we are relative to the law and the facts.\" The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission initiated a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, alleging that the company and its executives illegally sold XRP \u2014 a cryptocurrency created in 2012 \u2014 to investors without first registering it as a security. Ripple disputes the claim, saying that the token should not be considered an investment contract and is used in its business to facilitate cross-border transactions between banks and other financial institutions. In December, Ripple and the SEC submitted their final round of briefs seeking a summary judgment to the case, respectively accusing each other of stretching the law. The judge could make a ruling in favor of either side, avoiding a trial, or put the matter before a jury.\n\nGarlinghouse said that he expects a ruling to arrive \"some time in the coming single digit months\" \u2014 potentially as soon as June. He added that he doesn't expect the company will settle the case, although he remains open to the prospect. \"We have always said that we would love to settle, but it requires one very important thing, and that is that, on a go-forward basis, it's clear that XRP is not a security,\" Garlinghouse said. \"The SEC and Gary Gensler has very outwardly said he views almost all crypto as a security. And so that leaves very little space in the Venn diagram for settlement.\" At a September event organized by the Practising Law Institute, Gensler said that the \"vast majority\" of cryptocurrency tokens are securities. He subsequently hinted that ether may also qualify as a security. Without referring to it by name, Gensler told reporters in September that crypto \"staking\" mechanisms \u2014 which reward users who deposit their tokens to secure blockchain networks with interest-like payments \u2014 should count as securities offerings, since \"the investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts of others.\" Ethereum, the network behind the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, switched to such a model last year. The only cryptocurrency that the agency has made clear it doesn't view as a security is bitcoin. Gensler previously stated that the world's biggest cryptocurrency has \"no group of individuals in the middle,\" meaning investors aren't \"betting\" on an intermediary.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe XRP case has important implications for both Ripple and the broader crypto market. A judgment pronouncing XRP a security could potentially impose much stricter curbs on Ripple with respect to the token. This could include requirements for transparency disclosures and greater investor protections, akin to those imposed on regulated broker-dealers. It may also set a precedent for dozens of other crypto and blockchain projects that could potentially be classified as securities. Stressing the significance of the lawsuit's outcome, Garlinghouse said on Wednesday, \"Something I've heard here in Davos repeatedly is how important this is not just to Ripple... but also, really, the whole crypto industry in the United States.\" He added, \"I keep reminding people that outside the United States, crypto is still thriving, Ripple's still thriving, and we should make sure we're continuing to engage non-U.S. regulators as well.\"\n\n'Embarrassing' behavior\n\nIn a separate fireside discussion with CNBC's Arjun Kharpal Wednesday, Garlinghouse issued a stern rebuke of the SEC's legal battle with his firm, saying the conduct of the watchdog so far had been \"embarrassing.\" \"From the beginning, I thought it was very clear that the facts were on our side, that the law was on our side,\" he said. \"And I think as you have seen this play out, as you have seen the filings in the court, that the judge certainly is hearing our arguments.\"\n\nwatch now"
