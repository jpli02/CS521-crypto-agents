        "content": "Blockchain company Ripple's legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to cost the firm around $200 million, Cointelegraph reported Monday, citing the Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nGarlinghouse reportedly told onlookers at the Dubai Fintech Summit that he would not advise crypto entrepreneurs to set up in the U.S., adding that the country puts politics ahead of policy.\n\nRipple, along with several of its executives, was sued by the securities regulator in 2020 over the unregistered sale of XRP tokens worth around $1.3 billion. The same year, the firm opened its regional headquarters in Dubai.\n\nSince the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year, the SEC has cracked down on some of the biggest players in the industry over violations of federal securities laws \u2013 although it recently pulled back from officially defining \"digital assets.\"\n\nRipple has historically kept its distance from XRP, which powers some of Ripple\u2019s products.\n\nA judgement on the SEC case is expected in the next three to six weeks, according to the report. Hopes that the lawsuit would go in Ripple's favor caused the XRP token price to surge in March.\n\nRead more: Open Interest in XRP Surges to $800M as Crypto Traders Hope Ripple-SEC Verdict Will Bring 'Alt Season'"
