        "content": "Singapore-based fintech firm Nium Pte has announced its intention to go public in the United States by the second quarter of 2025, Bloomberg reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company, which is currently valued at approximately $2 billion, is aiming to break even before its planned initial public offering (IPO).\n\nCEO Prajit Nanu emphasized that forecasting market trends is beyond anyone's control, but their main goal over the next year and a half is to be thoroughly prepared.\n\nNium, formerly known as InstaReM, operates a platform that enables businesses to send, spend and receive funds around the globe.\n\nIn 2020, it entered into a partnership with prominent San Francisco-based blockchain company Ripple. The tie-up was designed to facilitate instant, low-cost international transactions.\n\nRipple's very own IPO plans\n\nRipple has been eyeing the horizon of going public. However, a legal storm brewing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cast a cloud over these plans.\n\nIn a conversation with CNBC during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Garlinghouse indicated that Ripple would set sail toward an IPO once the legal fog with the SEC clears.\n\nThis legal tug-of-war has been in play for nearly three years, and Ripple is hopeful for a resolution within the year. However, despite Garlinghouse's prediction about the case coming to an end in the first half of 2023, there is no final ruling as of early July."

        "content": "A prominent cryptocurrency analyst explains how XRP being valued at $1,000 per unit is peanuts.\n\nJackTheRippler, a top crypto analyst, has made bold assertions about XRP price hitting $1,000. In a tweet today, JackTheRippler said XRP changing hands at a whopping $1,000 per unit is \u201cpeanuts.\u201d\n\nThe top cryptocurrency analyst asserted that XRP is not a share nor a stock. According to JackTheRippler, XRP is a utility protocol designed to tokenize value across diverse markets, including commodities and derivatives markets.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFurthermore, JackTheRippler said over $1.2 quadrillion worth of assets across these markets need to be tokenized. He explained that the derivatives market alone is valued at around $500 trillion.\n\nConsequently, he speculates that if XRP can capture 10% of one of these markets, like the derivatives market, the cryptocurrency will be valued at a whopping $50T.\n\nAside from the derivatives market, JackTheRippler said there are other markets, including housing, debt, and commodities, that are worth at least $1.2 quadrillion, which XRP can also account for a significant share.\n\nIn this regard, JackTheRippler said XRP being valued at $1,000 per unit is nothing but peanuts.\n\nXRP is NOT a share/stock. It is a Utility protocol to tokenized value. There are over $1.2 Quadrillion to be tokenized. The Derivatives market is $500 Trillion alone! XRP to capture just 10% of one market is already at $50T.

Many enthusiasts are excited that a top analyst like JackTheRippler would speculate that XRP could hit $1,000 in the future.\n\nHowever, some XRP enthusiasts saw the analysis as a prayer request that needed divine intervention to come to pass.\n\nFrom your lips to Gods ears. \u2014 Ben (@BenMarkus1973) July 4, 2023\n\nXRP Current Performance\n\nMeanwhile, XRP has been trading between the price levels of $0.48 and $0.49 in the past few days. At the time of writing this line, XRP is changing hands at $0.486, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko data, XRP is up 0.7% and 0.9% in the past 7 and 14 days, respectively. Similarly, XRP has a market value of $25.4 billion.\n\nSEC Vs. Ripple Lawsuit Hurting XRP Price\n\nThe price of XRP has remained predominantly low due to the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple. Notably, the judge has yet to issue a verdict six months after the parties completed summary judgment briefings.\n\nThe ruling is expected to come at any time. A positive ruling for Ripple and XRP could propel the coin\u2019s price to spike. However, a verdict favoring the SEC could plunge the XRP price below its current level.\n\nInterestingly, the community, including attorney John Deaton, expects that Judge Analisa Torres will address XRP secondary market sales in the upcoming summary judgment."

        "title": "Why new gravitational ripples are blowing the minds of scientists worldwide - BBC Science Focus Magazine",
        "content": "In a Universe-shaking announcement, an international consortium of astronomers have presented evidence that the fabric of the cosmos itself is constantly vibrating with light-years-long gravitational waves.\n\nThese low-frequency disturbances in spacetime were seen with the help of a galaxy-spanning network of rapidly spinning neutron stars (the remains of massive stars post-supernova explosion) called pulsars.\n\nThe regular pulses of radio light that give pulsars their name serve as precise cosmic metronomes, hitting us once per stellar rotation, up to hundreds of times per second.\n\nBecause gravitational waves stretch and squeeze the space they\u2019re passing through, slightly changing the distances to the pulsars, their presence can be inferred if those metronome beats arrive a little early or late for sources in a specific pattern across the sky.\n\nWhile astronomers are extremely excited about this latest development, it's understandable if you are experiencing a bit of deja vu. Haven't we already detected gravitational waves? Didn't we know these were out there? It's true that pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are not bringing us the first evidence of the existence of gravitational waves.\n\nThat honour goes to the LIGO experiment, which, in late 2015, detected a violent disturbance in space due to two roughly 30-solar-mass black holes colliding in a distant galaxy.\n\nSince then, LIGO, in collaboration with partner observatories VIRGO and KAGRA, has detected a total of nearly 100 merger events involving black holes and neutron stars.\n\nThe big difference is one of frequency. Just as electromagnetic radiation \u2014 light \u2014 exists on a spectrum, from high-frequency (short-wavelength) gamma rays to visible light to low-frequency (long-wavelength) radio waves, gravitational waves are also generated at different frequencies by different kinds of cosmic events.\n\nWhen it comes to mergers, the main factors are the masses of the objects and the speed at which they\u2019re rotating around each other.\n\nBlack holes with stellar masses (those produced from the collapse of massive stars) whirl around each other hundreds of times per second during the final inspiral and create a burst of gravitational waves at the moment of collision.\n\nThese waves consequently have high frequencies and short wavelengths, matching the sensitivity range of instruments we have on Earth.\n\nSupermassive black hole pairs, on the other hand, emit appreciable gravitational waves when orbiting with periods of years, creating light-year-long waves and necessitating a detector the size of a galaxy, collecting data over decades.\n\nThe difference between what LIGO shows us and what we get from a PTA is like the difference between an image from an optical telescope and one from a radio antenna. Not only are the data and observational methods completely different, so are the lessons we learn about the Universe from them.\n\nWhat is all of the fuss about?\n\nSo, what exactly has the PTA collaboration found? So far, the main result, which was seen most clearly by the NANOGrav collaboration, is that low-frequency gravitational waves exist in the Universe all around us.\n\nEven though this release includes 15 years of data, it's not yet enough to show us specific sources. But the signal is consistent with a cosmic chorus of contributions produced by the final orbits of pairs of supermassive black holes merging when their galaxies collide.\n\nAssuming the background is primarily due to supermassive black hole collisions, the information contained in it is staggering. With just these first preliminary results, there are already indications that the final stages of galaxy mergers may be more exciting than we anticipated.\n\nFor one thing, the signal is somewhat louder than astronomers thought it would be, based on the most straightforward calculations of how galaxies and their supermassive black holes collide.\n\nThis might indicate that supermassive black holes are, on average, more massive, or colliding more often than expected. There is also some indication that collisions are helped along by the astrophysical environments in which they occur.\n\nThat is the central regions of galaxies are a bit messy and the combined effect of all the stars and gas and maybe some unexpected things hanging around them are jostling the supermassive black holes enough to make them come together sooner.\n\nWith just a few more years of observations, and the combination of data from all the PTAs, we should start to be able to see hints of individual sources. This raises the prospect of multi-messenger astronomy, in which a gravitational wave event could alert us to a merger in progress that we might also observe with a conventional telescope.\n\nWhereas the LIGO experiment gives us a new view of star formation and evolution by capturing the final moments of stellar remnants, PTAs will be able to show us the evolution and build-up of galaxies: the basic units of the large-scale structure of the Universe.\n\nOf course, this all depends on the signal truly originating in supermassive black hole collisions. We may be entirely wrong about that (the data are as-yet ambiguous) \u2013 which would be the most exciting possibility yet.\n\nViolent processes that may have shaped the early Universe can also produce a background of low-frequency gravitational waves, as can certain kinds of dark matter and some hypothetical exotic Big Bang relics.\n\nDetecting any of those, either as the dominant signal or as some contribution to it, would completely revolutionise our understanding of our cosmic history.\n\nIt is frequently said that every time we open a new window on the Universe, we find something completely new and unexpected. In the coming years, the full power of PTAs to illuminate our spacetime environment will be revealed.\n\nPerhaps they will give us a better view of the build-up of cosmic structure; perhaps they will take us all completely by surprise. Personally, I can't wait to find out.\n\nRead more about space:"

        "title": "Black hole ripples could help pin down expansion of Universe - The Royal Astronomical Society",
        "content": "The echoes of light from jets launched from black holes offers a new way to pin down the distance to these exotic objects and to study a largely unobserved population in the centre of the Galaxy. It could also even help determine the rate of expansion of the Universe. The technique, developed by a team at the University of Newcastle and tested on the archetype black hole Cygnus X-1, was presented by postgraduate researcher and team member Patrick O\u2019Neill at the National Astronomy Meeting in Cardiff.\n\nMost black holes are the compact remnants of stars that ended their lives in supernova explosions. They have such a strong gravitational field that not even light can escape their grasp, hence the description of them as black. Despite that, the influence on their surroundings can be very obvious, as material orbiting a black hole is concentrated into a disc, and can become very hot. This means they are strong sources of X-rays, and many also have associated jets spewing gas and dust out over huge distances.\n\nThe calculated distance to most black holes is based on their X-ray brightness and associated measurements of their mass, which can be deduced by how fast material swirls around them. O\u2019Neill and the other team members take a different approach.\n\nLight from the black hole jet is emitted in all directions, so this reaches the disc. Just like a mirror, the disc then reflects some part of the incoming light. Starting from the innermost part of the disc, the reflected light will ripple outwards as the light emitted in the jet takes longer to reach the outer parts of the disc. This \u2018reverberation\u2019 of light is akin to a sound echo.\n\nThis effectively means we see the light originating from the jet in two ways: the light that travels directly to us, and the light that is reflected by the disc. By simultaneously monitoring the brightness of the light that travels directly to us and the light that is reflected, it becomes possible to deduce how far the jet is above the disc. It also tells astronomers how close the inner boundary of the disc is to the black hole itself. Closer in the gravitational field of the black hole disrupts the shape of the disc.\n\nMonitoring the light emitted from the black hole jet and its surrounding disc together enables the team to calculate the size of the disc, and the fraction of the light it reflects. That gives an absolute measurement of the brightness of the disc, and hence the distance to the black hole-disc system.\n\nDense clouds of gas and dust typically block infrared, visible and ultraviolet light emitted from the centres of galaxies (including our own), restricting our view. In contrast, X-rays can cross these regions unimpeded, so it should be possible to measure the distance to supermassive black holes. If that can be done, it will be a new way of determining how fast the universe is expanding, something still not settled 94 years after the discovery of the expansion itself.\n\nIt is also a powerful tool for probing the population of black holes in the centre of the Galaxy. Up to now astronomers tended to observe black holes that were relatively light, and away from the plane of the Galaxy where most stars are found (our Galaxy has spiral arms in a flat disc winding out from a central bar).\n\nSometimes a black hole and a massive star orbit each other in a binary system. If the massive star explodes as a supernova, the black hole can be thrown out of the plane of the galaxy. The heavier the black hole, the smaller the acceleration, so heavier mass black holes will be found closer to the galactic plane and in the galactic centre.\n\nO\u2019Neill says: \u201cOften we are limited to observations of distant galaxies to make inferences about the Milky Way. This cutting-edge technique offers a method of probing the previously concealed galactic centre, offering a new insights into the evolution of our own Galaxy and how black holes accrete material[MOU1] . It\u2019s also exciting to think that we could help to establish the rate at which the Universe is expanding \u2013 and get a better understanding of its future.\u201d\n\nThe team now want to build up a picture of the population of black holes in the centre of the Galaxy. This could help find objects like intermediate mass black holes, objects thought to result from the mergers of black holes from single stars, and a step on the way to forming the monster-sized supermassive black holes found in the centre of most galaxies.\n\nMedia contacts\n\nDr Robert Massey\n\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n\nTel: +44 (0)20 7292 3979\n\nMob: +44 (0)7802 877 699\n\nnam-press@ras.ac.uk\n\nMs Gurjeet Kahlon\n\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n\nMob: +44 (0)7802 877700\n\nnam-press@ras.ac.uk\n\nMs Megan Eaves\n\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n\nnam-press@ras.ac.uk\n\nScience contact\n\nPatrick O\u2019Neill\n\nUniversity of Newcastle\n\nMob: +44 (0)7807 811878\n\nP.O'Neill3@newcastle.ac.uk\n\n\n\nNotes for editors\n\nThe NAM 2023 conference is principally sponsored by the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and Cardiff University.\n\nAbout the Royal Astronomical Society\n\nThe Royal Astronomical Society (RAS, https://ras.ac.uk), founded in 1820, encourages and promotes the study of astronomy, solar-system science, geophysics and closely related branches of science.
