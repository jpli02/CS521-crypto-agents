        "content": "The SEC is seeking a federal judge's approval to appeal her ruling finding that Ripple's programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities law. If Judge Analisa Torres, of the Southern District of New York, signs off on the bid, the SEC will need to convince the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to take up the case. In its filing Friday, Ripple argued that there are no controlling law questions and that an appeal wouldn't lead to a faster resolution of the overall case."

        "content": "In this week\u2019s Roundup newsletter we discuss SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s growing list if courtroom setbacks.\n\nHaving already partially lost against Ripple this summer, the regulator was hit with fresh disappointments this week when Grayscale and Uniswap won their cases.\n\nElsewhere, we look at Solana\u2019s post-FTX recovery, Elon Musk\u2019s latest payments push, and the supply of Dai.\n\nA version of this story appeared in our The Roundup newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up.\n\nHappy Friday!\n\nAdam Morgan here with a digest of the week\u2019s most important crypto stories.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has racked up courtroom losses up and down the Eastern seaboard. Two significant setbacks this week could force the regulator to rethink its approach.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale\u2019s proposal to convert its flagship Bitcoin trust into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was unanimously overturned. The loss could pave the way for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\n\u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\u201d Judge Neomi Rao wrote in the decision.\n\nUp the road in New York, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the US District Court in Manhattan dealt the regulator another blow on Tuesday.\n\nShe dismissed a lawsuit brought by Nessa Risley on behalf of other investors, in which Risley claimed she\u2019d suffered \u201csubstantial losses\u201d after buying tokens on Uniswap, which is a decentralised crypto exchange.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nJudge Failla rejected the contention that Uniswap was a securities exchange and could be held accountable.\n\nAnother setback for Gary Gensler, and the latest since Ripple partially won its case against the regulator in July. The chair of the SEC has long argued cryptocurrencies should be regulated like stocks and bonds.\n\nThat\u2019s all for this week, have a great weekend,\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy\n\nLike this newsletter?
