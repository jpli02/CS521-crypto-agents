        "content": "In a recent tweet, Ripple stated that the number of financial leaders around the globe who are confident in crypto has risen to more than 70% this year. Ripple hinted that there are several major factors that are fuelling this growth of optimism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, since Ripple is one of the major crypto service providers for financial institutions, it may mean that its expansion will continue in the future.\n\nSea of opportunities for Ripple here\n\nIn particular, the tweet mentioned tokenization and its potential to advance global innovation. It is likely to impact such spheres as trading public stocks and private shares, various events, games and metaverses.\n\nBlockchain will change the sphere of finance as leaders use it as leverage to innovate their companies and business. The potential perks from using DLT are better efficiency in business operations, managing big volumes of data and improving financial flexibility.\n\nFinally, businesses can use digital currencies for micropayments, cross-border payments and for letting clients pay for goods and services with them.\n\nThis provides a wide field for Ripple to expand into as it is already providing financial services for a wide range of companies and financial institutions around the world, including major banks. The number of Ripple's institutional clients exceeds 300.\n\nBesides, it also provides services through its on-demand liquidity platform (ODL), which allows sending funds using XRP token to any part of the world within a short time, unlike traditional bank transactions, including SWIFT."

        "title": "Ripple-SEC Court Ruling: Implications for the Crypto Industry and Investors - Nasdaq",
        "content": "In early July, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued its long-anticipated opinion ruling in SEC v. Ripple Labs. They provided a split decision, granting and denying different aspects of each of the parties' motions, and specifically found that XRP, the primary digital token at issue in the matter, \"is not in and of itself a 'contract, transaction [,] or scheme' that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract.\"\n\nThis finding is distinctly important not only for the Ripple defendants, but also to the larger digital assets industry, as the SEC has long taken the position that all tokens (excluding bitcoin) are, in and of themselves, investment contract securities. The ruling that XRP is not a \"contract\" and that it depends on the circumstances creates a new set of ambiguities.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called the Torres ruling \"an unequivocal win for Ripple and for crypto in the U.S.\" Garlinghouse separately picked at the SEC's attempts to be the lead regulator of digital assets. \"The SEC created this mess by proclaiming it was the cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction,\" he tweeted. \u201cWe all know legislation \u2013 not more regulation by enforcement \u2013 is the only way forward to provide clear rules and protect retail.\"\n\nThe ruling was cheered by the cryptocurrency community and particularly by exchanges, which feel the outcome will help create some more regulatory clarity. Coinbase is one such exchange, which was sued in June by the SEC on charges of operating an unregistered exchange and broker. The latest Ripple-SEC court opinion has given confidence to Coinbase in its case against the SEC.\n\n\u201cFor exchanges, for tokens that are listed on exchanges, for regular investors, there\u2019s no question that this ruling strikes a blow to the idea that somehow securities are being traded when people go onto exchanges and trade the assets,\u201d Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, told CNBC. \u201cI think we will win. Now, I thought we would win before this decision. We think this decision has only further strengthened the case,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a different view on the ruling. A week after the ruling, in a filing against Terraform Labs and former Terra-Luna CEO, Do Kwon, the SEC referenced the Ripple Labs ruling and highlighted a host of issues it holds against the court\u2019s recent decision on XRP.\n\n\u201cContrary to [Ripple's] assertions, much of the Ripple ruling supports the SEC\u2019s claims in this case and rejects arguments [Ripple] has raised here. However, with respect to the Programmatic and other sales, the SEC respectfully avers that Ripple conflicts with and adds baseless requirements to Howey and its progeny,\u201d the SEC stated, adding: \u201cRespectfully, those portions of Ripple were wrongly decided, and this Court should not follow them. SEC staff is considering the various available avenues for further review and intends to recommend that the SEC seek such review.\u201d\n\nSome portions of the ruling supported the SEC claims and on those which did not, SEC might potentially appeal. If so, the case might be headed to trial and the legal battle might drag on, putting additional pressure on the cryptocurrency space. So, who really won here?\n\nIt appears that the split decision in the Ripple ruling created more confusion and ambiguity rather than the clarity that the crypto industry and investors have been hoping for. Is there a way to resolve this confusion and gain clarity? What are the plausible solutions? Before we answer these questions, let\u2019s first understand the nuances of the ruling and its implications on investors, both retail and institutional, as well as the crypto industry.\n\nRipple Labs Ruling\n\nAlthough the parties disagreed on many aspects of the factual record in their briefing, they agreed on the types of XRP distribution transactions:\n\nDirect sale to institutional investors (Institutional Sales) Algorithmic sales of XRP on digital asset trading platforms (Programmatic Sales) XRP distributions to Ripple employees and third parties (Other Distributions)\n\nEach of these transactions occurred without the defendants (Ripple) filing any registration statements.\n\nInstitutional Sales\n\nThe court determined that Institutional Sales, where sophisticated individuals and entities purchased XRP directly from Ripple via written contracts, are considered securities. The main reasoning is that institutional investors were more likely to be aware of XRP\u2019s securities-like traits when being pitched by Ripple back then.\n\nProgrammatic Sales\n\nUnlike Institutional Sales, where institutional investors knowingly purchased XRP directly from Ripple through written contracts, Programmatic Sales occurred on crypto exchanges in blind bid/ask transactions, and buyers could not know that their payments were going directly to Ripple to fund its operations and therefore do not fall under the Howey test. Furthermore the Programmatic Sales constituted less than 1% of global XRP trading volume, so most purchasers of XRP on exchanges were not investing directly in Ripple at all.\n\nTherefore, XRP Programmatic Sales are not considered securities. It should be noted that if the percentage of Programmatic Sales were more significant, these transactions might have been considered securities.\n\nOther Distributions\n\nDistributions to Employees and Other Third Parties\n\nOther Distributions by Ripple, including distributions to employees as a form of compensation and distributions to third parties as compensation for services, are not considered securities. The main reason is that both employees and third parties did not \u201cpay money or \u2018some tangible and definable consideration\u2019 to Ripple\u201d in exchange for receiving XRP. Rather, Ripple paid XRP to its employees and third-party developers for providing services to Ripple.\n\nOffers and Sales of XRP by Garlinghouse and Larsen\n\nThe sales of XRP by Garlinghouse and Larsen on crypto exchanges are not considered securities transactions. Like in the case of Programmatic Sales, buyers in these transactions did not know the identity of the seller. Both Ripple and the SEC would have reason to view this outcome as a potential win, as it gives credence to the security-or-not debate on either side.\n\nThe implications\n\nThe crypto industry's claims of victory might be a bit overstated. There are a few aspects of the ruling that could limit the impact many have read into the opinion and in particular, the implications of the ruling, on the following areas:\n\nSecondary markets (i.e., exchanges) and other tokens\n\nSEC regulation by enforcement policy and position\n\nRetail investors\n\nInstitutional investors\n\nWe'll take a look at these four points one by one:\n\nSecondary markets and other tokens\n\nSome are taking this decision to mean Coinbase and others accused of listing potential securities to be in the clear, at least when it comes to the public buying on their exchanges.\n\nJudge Torres expressly declined to expand her opinion to secondary market sales (i.e., exchanges) of XRP or other tokens, essentially saying that it depends on the circumstances and the economic reality of a specific transaction. It is expected, though, that digital asset exchanges might be able to leverage several aspects of this opinion for their benefit \u2013 most notably extending the Programmatic Sales analysis to argue there are no securities transactions at issue and thus they can't be considered unregistered exchanges. However, the ruling here does not resolve this question fully.\n\nSEC regulation by enforcement policy and position\n\nThe SEC now has the benefit of Judge Torres's opinion, meaning the agency's likely will adapt it to the extent it pursues similar theories going forward. For example, the SEC may develop and advance more robust evidence of consideration of employees\u2019 compensation with tokens as securities \u2013 potentially the SEC might analogize tokens offered to employees to stock options. Likewise, it may develop more concrete through lines between secondary market purchases and the \"promises and offers made to investors\" \u2013 plausibly the SEC could claim that this should be no different than the expectations an investor has when investing in a publicly traded company.\n\nGiven the SEC's explicit and aggressive enforcement stance regarding tokens as securities, it\u2019s unlikely that the SEC would retreat from the positions it has staked out. Days after the ruling, the SEC hit a blockchain security company with charges of alleged violations going back six years. The SEC charged Quantstamp with conducting an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO) of crypto securities in 2017. Quantstamp agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, paying nearly $2.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest in addition to a $1 million civil penalty.\n\nIn early August, the SEC charged Hex Founder, Richard Heart, with conducting unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities that raised more than $1 billion and of defrauding investors of $12 million to buy, among other things, a 555-carat black diamond.\n\nRetail Investors\n\nThe decision was based on how well retail investors understood crypto years ago, during the period that ended in 2020. At that time, Bitcoin was worth a fraction of what it is now, and regulators were only beginning to form opinions about crypto, something that has plainly changed. Could the SEC address the court's issue by making sure what counts as a security is clear to the public going forward?\n\nFor the past few years, Gensler has made his position very clear: all tokens but Bitcoin falls within the jurisdiction of the SEC. No other regulator or legislator has been as consistent and vocal about digital assets; thus, the perceived public notion might be that tokens are securities.\n\nInstitutional Investors\n\nMany successful crypto projects these days rely on early sales of their tokens to institutional investors and venture capitalists (VC) prior to their public launch to get off the ground, often pre-registering those efforts with regulators to avoid any potential repercussions.\n\nMany on the SEC\u2019s list of possible securities had conducted these types of arrangements, and the SEC cited those examples as reasons the tokens should fall under its jurisdiction. With this ruling, that type of pre-funding might be done for, unless VCs are amenable to buying on the open market when prices are subject to the same volatility as everyone else.\n\nWhat would that mean for funding future projects? Will institutional investors and VC continue to fund knowing that they are investing in securities? And how would that impact the continued innovation for Web3, especially with new projects? The answers to these questions are yet to be determined.\n\nHow can we gain more clarity? What are the solutions?\n\nUnlike most developed countries, the U.S. has not developed a comprehensive framework for the crypto industry. Instead, the nascent industry is governed by opaque administrative guidelines and unclear rules.\n\nLate July, Bank of America published a research report emphasizing that while the digital asset industry welcomed the decision of the Ripple case, the \u201cimplications of the rulings are difficult to determine.\u201d The bank calls for a comprehensive regulatory framework, stating that establishing such a framework is crucial for mainstream adoption of digital assets and institutional engagement.\n\nLegislation would be the best route to gain clarity.\n\nA week after the ruling, the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion introduced the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. The bill addresses the sales of such assets as part of an investment contract on an exchange, or those distributed via airdrops. It crucially fills the regulatory void for the digital asset spot market that the SEC does not oversee.\n\n\u201cThe FIT for the 21st Century Act is the legislative solution we need to ensure both crypto-native and traditional finance companies can responsibly innovate in this market while establishing consumer protections that do not currently exist,\u201d the announcement reads.\n\nUnder this bill, a digital asset subject to a securities offering must comply with securities laws until the blockchain network supporting the digital asset becomes decentralized and is certified by the SEC. After decentralization, the digital asset can be traded as a digital commodity on a digital commodity exchange. Additionally, recipients of earned or airdropped digital assets can trade them as digital commodities.\n\nDefining \u201cdecentralization\u201d might be challenging. The Bank of France, which issued a discussion paper called \"Decentralized or disintermediated finance: what regulatory response,\" contained 38 questions and asked for responses from the public, has been struggling with the definition of \u201cdecentralization\u201d and when a project becomes \u201cdecentralized.\u201d\n\nAlthough there might be challenges, this suggested bill might be a good start for gaining clarity. The Ripple-SEC ruling generated more uncertainty and confusion, rather than the clarity the industry hoped for. More clarity on digital assets regulations is needed \u2013 and sooner rather than later. It is vital that the U.S. legislators follow a more proactive approach, and the FIT Act might be a good place to start.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The latest Ripple-SEC court opinion has given confidence to Coinbase in its case against the SEC.\n\n\u201cFor exchanges, for tokens that are listed on exchanges, for regular investors, there\u2019s no question that this ruling strikes a blow to the idea that somehow securities are being traded when people go onto exchanges and trade the assets,\u201d Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, told CNBC. \u201cI think we will win. Now, I thought we would win before this decision. We think this decision has only further strengthened the case,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a different view on the ruling. A week after the ruling, in a filing against Terraform Labs and former Terra-Luna CEO, Do Kwon, the SEC referenced the Ripple Labs ruling and highlighted a host of issues it holds against the court\u2019s recent decision on XRP.\n\n\u201cContrary to [Ripple's] assertions, much of the Ripple ruling supports the SEC\u2019s claims in this case and rejects arguments [Ripple] has raised here. However, with respect to the Programmatic and other sales, the SEC respectfully avers that Ripple conflicts with and adds baseless requirements to Howey and its progeny,\u201d the SEC stated, adding: \u201cRespectfully, those portions of Ripple were wrongly decided, and this Court should not follow them. SEC staff is considering the various available avenues for further review and intends to recommend that the SEC seek such review.\u201d\n\nSome portions of the ruling supported the SEC claims and on those which did not, SEC might potentially appeal. If so, the case might be headed to trial and the legal battle might drag on, putting additional pressure on the cryptocurrency space. So, who really won here?\n\nIt appears that the split decision in the Ripple ruling created more confusion and ambiguity rather than the clarity that the crypto industry and investors have been hoping for. Is there a way to resolve this confusion and gain clarity? What are the plausible solutions? Before we answer these questions, let\u2019s first understand the nuances of the ruling and its implications on investors, both retail and institutional, as well as the crypto industry.\n\nRipple Labs Ruling\n\nAlthough the parties disagreed on many aspects of the factual record in their briefing, they agreed on the types of XRP distribution transactions:\n\nDirect sale to institutional investors (Institutional Sales) Algorithmic sales of XRP on digital asset trading platforms (Programmatic Sales) XRP distributions to Ripple employees and third parties (Other Distributions)\n\nEach of these transactions occurred without the defendants (Ripple) filing any registration statements.\n\nInstitutional Sales\n\nThe court determined that Institutional Sales, where sophisticated individuals and entities purchased XRP directly from Ripple via written contracts, are considered securities. The main reasoning is that institutional investors were more likely to be aware of XRP\u2019s securities-like traits when being pitched by Ripple back then.\n\nProgrammatic Sales\n\nUnlike Institutional Sales, where institutional investors knowingly purchased XRP directly from Ripple through written contracts, Programmatic Sales occurred on crypto exchanges in blind bid/ask transactions, and buyers could not know that their payments were going directly to Ripple to fund its operations and therefore do not fall under the Howey test. Furthermore the Programmatic Sales constituted less than 1% of global XRP trading volume, so most purchasers of XRP on exchanges were not investing directly in Ripple at all.\n\nTherefore, XRP Programmatic Sales are not considered securities. It should be noted that if the percentage of Programmatic Sales were more significant, these transactions might have been considered securities.\n\nOther Distributions\n\nDistributions to Employees and Other Third Parties\n\nOther Distributions by Ripple, including distributions to employees as a form of compensation and distributions to third parties as compensation for services, are not considered securities. The main reason is that both employees and third parties did not \u201cpay money or \u2018some tangible and definable consideration\u2019 to Ripple\u201d in exchange for receiving XRP. Rather, Ripple paid XRP to its employees and third-party developers for providing services to Ripple.\n\nOffers and Sales of XRP by Garlinghouse and Larsen\n\nThe sales of XRP by Garlinghouse and Larsen on crypto exchanges are not considered securities transactions. Like in the case of Programmatic Sales, buyers in these transactions did not know the identity of the seller. Both Ripple and the SEC would have reason to view this outcome as a potential win, as it gives credence to the security-or-not debate on either side.\n\nThe implications\n\nThe crypto industry's claims of victory might be a bit overstated. There are a few aspects of the ruling that could limit the impact many have read into the opinion and in particular, the implications of the ruling, on the following areas:\n\nSecondary markets (i.e., exchanges) and other tokens\n\nSEC regulation by enforcement policy and position\n\nRetail investors\n\nInstitutional investors\n\nWe'll take a look at these four points one by one:\n\nSecondary markets and other tokens\n\nSome are taking this decision to mean Coinbase and others accused of listing potential securities to be in the clear, at least when it comes to the public buying on their exchanges.\n\nJudge Torres expressly declined to expand her opinion to secondary market sales (i.e., exchanges) of XRP or other tokens, essentially saying that it depends on the circumstances and the economic reality of a specific transaction. It is expected, though, that digital asset exchanges might be able to leverage several aspects of this opinion for their benefit \u2013 most notably extending the Programmatic Sales analysis to argue there are no securities transactions at issue and thus they can't be considered unregistered exchanges. However, the ruling here does not resolve this question fully.\n\nSEC regulation by enforcement policy and position\n\nThe SEC now has the benefit of Judge Torres's opinion, meaning the agency's likely will adapt it to the extent it pursues similar theories going forward. For example, the SEC may develop and advance more robust evidence of consideration of employees\u2019 compensation with tokens as securities \u2013 potentially the SEC might analogize tokens offered to employees to stock options. Likewise, it may develop more concrete through lines between secondary market purchases and the \"promises and offers made to investors\" \u2013 plausibly the SEC could claim that this should be no different than the expectations an investor has when investing in a publicly traded company.\n\nGiven the SEC's explicit and aggressive enforcement stance regarding tokens as securities, it\u2019s unlikely that the SEC would retreat from the positions it has staked out. Days after the ruling, the SEC hit a blockchain security company with charges of alleged violations going back six years. The SEC charged Quantstamp with conducting an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO) of crypto securities in 2017. Quantstamp agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, paying nearly $2.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest in addition to a $1 million civil penalty.\n\nIn early August, the SEC charged Hex Founder, Richard Heart, with conducting unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities that raised more than $1 billion and of defrauding investors of $12 million to buy, among other things, a 555-carat black diamond.\n\nRetail Investors\n\nThe decision was based on how well retail investors understood crypto years ago, during the period that ended in 2020. At that time, Bitcoin was worth a fraction of what it is now, and regulators were only beginning to form opinions about crypto, something that has plainly changed. Could the SEC address the court's issue by making sure what counts as a security is clear to the public going forward?\n\nFor the past few years, Gensler has made his position very clear: all tokens but Bitcoin falls within the jurisdiction of the SEC. No other regulator or legislator has been as consistent and vocal about digital assets; thus, the perceived public notion might be that tokens are securities.\n\nInstitutional Investors\n\nMany successful crypto projects these days rely on early sales of their tokens to institutional investors and venture capitalists (VC) prior to their public launch to get off the ground, often pre-registering those efforts with regulators to avoid any potential repercussions.\n\nMany on the SEC\u2019s list of possible securities had conducted these types of arrangements, and the SEC cited those examples as reasons the tokens should fall under its jurisdiction. With this ruling, that type of pre-funding might be done for, unless VCs are amenable to buying on the open market when prices are subject to the same volatility as everyone else.\n\nWhat would that mean for funding future projects? Will institutional investors and VC continue to fund knowing that they are investing in securities? And how would that impact the continued innovation for Web3, especially with new projects? The answers to these questions are yet to be determined.\n\nHow can we gain more clarity? What are the solutions?\n\nUnlike most developed countries, the U.S. has not developed a comprehensive framework for the crypto industry. Instead, the nascent industry is governed by opaque administrative guidelines and unclear rules.\n\nLate July, Bank of America published a research report emphasizing that while the digital asset industry welcomed the decision of the Ripple case, the \u201cimplications of the rulings are difficult to determine.\u201d The bank calls for a comprehensive regulatory framework, stating that establishing such a framework is crucial for mainstream adoption of digital assets and institutional engagement.\n\nLegislation would be the best route to gain clarity.\n\nA week after the ruling, the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion introduced the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. The bill addresses the sales of such assets as part of an investment contract on an exchange, or those distributed via airdrops. It crucially fills the regulatory void for the digital asset spot market that the SEC does not oversee.\n\n\u201cThe FIT for the 21st Century Act is the legislative solution we need to ensure both crypto-native and traditional finance companies can responsibly innovate in this market while establishing consumer protections that do not currently exist,\u201d the announcement reads.\n\nUnder this bill, a digital asset subject to a securities offering must comply with securities laws until the blockchain network supporting the digital asset becomes decentralized and is certified by the SEC. After decentralization, the digital asset can be traded as a digital commodity on a digital commodity exchange. Additionally, recipients of earned or airdropped digital assets can trade them as digital commodities.\n\nDefining \u201cdecentralization\u201d might be challenging. The Bank of France, which issued a discussion paper called \"Decentralized or disintermediated finance: what regulatory response,\" contained 38 questions and asked for responses from the public, has been struggling with the definition of \u201cdecentralization\u201d and when a project becomes \u201cdecentralized.\u201d\n\nAlthough there might be challenges, this suggested bill might be a good start for gaining clarity. The Ripple-SEC ruling generated more uncertainty and confusion, rather than the clarity the industry hoped for. More clarity on digital assets regulations is needed \u2013 and sooner rather than later. It is vital that the U.S. legislators follow a more proactive approach, and the FIT Act might be a good place to start.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
