        "content": "Few know that the modern cloud revolution originated on South African soil, before Amazon Web Services (AWS) became a global leader in cloud computing.\n\nThis origin story traces back to the founding of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) service in 2004, which is now regarded as one of the fundamental pieces of cloud computing technology. A passionate team of AWS developers and engineers in Cape Town, South Africa, created a single virtual server instance allowing South African customers to access practically unlimited cloud computing capacity without needing an on-premises data center. It was a watershed moment for AWS, and it changed the trajectory of cloud computing worldwide. The development of Amazon EC2 in South Africa also resulted in significant economic impacts.\n\nFast forward to 2018, when AWS announced plans to launch data center infrastructure in the country. Since then, AWS has invested ZAR 15.6 billion through 2022 to meet customer demand for cloud computing services, according to a new economic impact study (EIS) from AWS. Thousands of South African customers have used AWS technologies to transform their businesses and accelerate their innovation, agility, and cost savings since AWS launched the AWS Africa (Cape Town) Region in 2020. The new EIS states that AWS plans to invest ZAR 30.4 billion more in its South African cloud infrastructure by 2029.\n\nAWS\u2019s investment in South Africa from 2018-2022 has contributed ZAR 12 billion in gross domestic product (GDP), while supporting an estimated average of 5,700 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs locally on an average annual basis. This includes local vendors in construction, engineering, energy consulting, plumbing, maintenance, and security. According to the EIS, AWS operations will add an estimated ZAR 68 billion more to South Africa\u2019s GDP by 2029.\n\nAWS\u2019s investment impacts other parts of the South African economy as well, helping develop the next generation of workforce, digitally transform businesses, and promote sustainability throughout the country.\n\nAn overview of AWS\u2019s planned investment and its estimated economic impact in South Africa from 2018-2029. View a larger version of the image here.\n\nWorkforce now and in the future\n\nThe jobs supported by AWS\u2019s investment span sectors such as telecommunications, nonresidential construction, electricity generation, facilities maintenance, and data center operations. AWS\u2019s investment includes multiple programs that develop the next generation of technology workforce. Through the AWS Activate program\u2014a global program offering startups no cost access to training resources, business support, and promotional credits for AWS services\u2014more than 2,600 companies in South Africa received access to over R340 million in AWS Promotional Credits in 2018\u20132022.\n\nDigital transformation\n\nTo help meet South Africa\u2019s National Digital and Future Skills Strategy, AWS is committed to supporting digital literacy goals through innovative development programs. In 2019, AWS launched the AWS Equity Equivalent Investment Program (EEIP) in South Africa, to pursue its mission to invest over $20 million (ZAR 365 million) in developing 100% black-owned small information and communications technology (ICT) and digital economy businesses in the country through December 2026. The EEIP allows small business owners to participate in an 18-to-24 month development and incubation program, becoming certified developers and solutions architects in the AWS Partner Network (APN) The program has supported the creation of 75 permanent jobs at local businesses, including 24 positions for women and 17 for youth. Through the EEIP program AWS plans to help small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs) build technical capacity and skills to deliver services, expand into new markets, access capital for training and product development, and receive customer deal support.\n\nSustainability in South Africa\n\nAmazon is committed to becoming a more sustainable business and is the world\u2019s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy. Amazon is on a path to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 \u2013 five years ahead of its original target. AWS launched a 10 megawatt (MW) solar power plant in South Africa\u2019s Northern Cape Province in 2021 This project is expected to generate up to 28,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable energy per year\u2014equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of over 8,000 South African homes. It will avoid producing an estimated 25,000 tons of carbon emissions annually\u2014equivalent to removing 5,400 cars from South Africa\u2019s roads.\n\nRead the full AWS Economic Impact Study and discover how AWS is committed to transformation in Africa.\n\nLearn more about how organizations in South Africa are using AWS to innovate for their communities.\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the AWS Public Sector Blog newsletter to get the latest in AWS tools, solutions, and innovations from the public sector delivered to your inbox, or contact us.\n\nPlease take a few minutes to share insights regarding your experience with the AWS Public Sector Blog in this survey, and we\u2019ll use feedback from the survey to create more content aligned with the preferences of our readers."

        "content": "We are excited to announce that Ripple Liquidity Hub is officially open for business. Last year we launched a successful pilot, and now Liquidity Hub is publicly available to provide businesses with a simple, seamless way to manage their modern crypto liquidity needs. Designed for usability and interoperability, it gives enterprise customers a competitive advantage in a multi-asset future.\n\nA Future Defined by Liquidity\n\nWe are rapidly moving towards a multi-asset reality wherein consumers and businesses will have to manage a broad portfolio of assets across fiat, cryptocurrencies, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and more.\n\nBusinesses must be able to move into and out of these distinct assets quickly and easily regardless of the number of users on the platform, trading volume, and market efficiency \u2014all aspects which may impact liquidity. A key component to this is ensuring businesses do not have to sacrifice value in order to execute transactions like affordable, real-time cross-border payments. Crypto and digital assets can also enhance transparency and facilitate treasury functions.\n\nThese use cases all hinge on interoperability, requiring strong on- and off-ramps between crypto and fiat and deep pools of liquidity between asset pairs\u2014or a crypto asset to bridge lesser pools.\n\nMaximize Crypto Liquidity\n\nLiquidity Hub was created in response to the gap and inefficiencies associated with bridging the world of crypto and fiat. It functions as a standalone solution or an extension of our cross-border payments solution which leverages our global network to provide partners access to payout rails worldwide.\n\nAs a turnkey solution for enterprises, Liquidity Hub was designed to source digital assets from the broader crypto market more easily and efficiently. We wanted to make it as frictionless as possible for businesses looking to supercharge liquidity, power crypto payments and operations, or support end-customers interested in buying, selling or holding crypto.\n\n\u201cLiquidity Hub benefits from all the hard-won lessons Ripple gained sourcing liquidity from other providers and across multiple venues for ODL. It combines ease of use, powerful payment integrations, cost savings and more into a single, scalable enterprise-grade platform,\u201d said Brad Chase, Head of Liquidity Products at Ripple.\n\nReduce Costs and Free Trapped Capital\n\nAvailable 24/7/365, Liquidity Hub leverages smart order routing to source a variety of digital assets at optimized prices across multiple liquidity venues, including market makers, exchanges and OTC desks. These deep liquidity pools from multiple providers ensure liquidity is sourced when you need it\u2014from USD to BTC, ETH, ETC, BCH, LTC, USDC and USDT.\n\nXRP will be evaluated along with other tokens for support within the product. We look forward to supporting XRP as it receives regulatory clarity in the U.S.\n\nBy optimizing crypto pricing and liquidity across asset pairs, businesses can realize significant cost savings on high-volume transactions like treasury management.\n\nImportantly, Liquidity Hub reduces the need to pre-fund capital positions to source liquidity or transactions within multiple venues, freeing up previously trapped capital that can be applied to other areas of your business.\n\nEliminate Complex Liquidity Management\n\nThis solution makes it easy to source and manage liquidity across several venues. And because it uses a streamlined API, businesses can get started on their crypto strategies without the intensive integrations and unnecessary investments of time and resources.\n\nOnce live, Liquidity Hub eliminates complex multi-venue management requirements by allowing businesses to access digital assets all in one place. Multi-asset, multi-venue sourcing also locks in optimized pricing and stability to shield businesses from market volatility and price swings.\n\nThe intuitive dashboard enables streamlined managing, trading and reporting of transactions to further simplify digital asset management. This simple, user-focused approach helps companies avoid having to build teams of crypto experts, affording more time, budget and headcount.\n\n\u201cLiquidity Hub offers both usability and interoperability, helping teams quickly and easily get started and then manage the assets that drive their business,\u201d said Chase.\n\nPower An Interoperable Future\n\nLiquidity Hub is an integral part of Ripple\u2019s commitment to helping businesses unlock immediate, real-world value through crypto and blockchain.\n\nAt its core, it allows for seamless bridging between traditional fiat and crypto assets. Paired with Ripple\u2019s broader suite of products, Liquidity Hub enables businesses to optimize crypto liquidity and tap an extensive network of global payout rails to streamline crypto transactions, treasury management and other applications.\n\nIts streamlined API and simple, intuitive design make it easy for customers to deploy and manage. And its ability to execute real-time trades around the clock with a minimum number of re-quotes or slippage all while meeting a high bar for security and regulatory standards provides peace of mind for any business.\n\nRipple Liquidity Hub is a purpose-built platform for enterprises that confers a critical business advantage in a crypto-first future.\n\nAvailable by jurisdiction, click here to learn more about Liquidity Hub."
