        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSEC\u2019s Action Against Kraken: The SEC sued Kraken for operating without proper registration, highlighting compliance issues in the crypto industry.\n\nThe SEC sued Kraken for operating without proper registration, highlighting compliance issues in the crypto industry. XRP Excluded from Kraken Lawsuit: XRP, Ripple\u2019s token, was not listed in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Kraken, though its price saw a minor decline.\n\nXRP, Ripple\u2019s token, was not listed in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Kraken, though its price saw a minor decline. Ripple\u2019s SEC Lawsuit Progresses: Ripple is engaged in an ongoing legal battle with the SEC, with a significant trial set for next spring after some initial wins for Ripple.\n\nInteresting Observation\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown another punch at the cryptocurrency industry recently, filing a lawsuit against Kraken. The regulator accused the company of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency.\n\n\u201cWe allege that Kraken made a business decision to reap hundreds of millions of dollars from investors rather than coming into compliance with the securities laws. That decision resulted in a business model rife with conflicts of interest that placed investors\u2019 funds at risk,\u201d said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement.\n\nIn addition, the watchdog alleged that Kraken had offered trading services with several unregistered securities. However, Ripple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 is not part of the lengthy list.\n\nDespite not being involved in the legal battle against Kraken, the asset\u2019s price has experienced a slight decline, dropping by 2% for the past 24 hours and 6% on a weekly basis (according to CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nSEC\u2019s Lawsuit Against Ripple\n\nApart from suing Kraken, America\u2019s securities regulator has filed additional lawsuits against cryptocurrency firms, including Binance and Ripple.\n\nThe legal battle with the latter is among the trendiest topics in the sector, with the blockchain enterprise currently having the upper hand after winning three major (yet partial wins) over the past few months.\n\nMost recently, Judge Analisa Torres set a schedule for remedies-related discovery and briefing, and both entities are required to complete the necessary procedures before February 12, 2024. A grand trial next spring should determine the outcome of the battle, which started almost three years ago."

        "content": "Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.\n\nTrading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency.\n\nMarket capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset\u2019s current market value. For Bitcoin, the market capitalization at the beginning of August 2023 is above $570 billion, which is the result of the more than 19 million BTC in circulation multiplied by the Bitcoin price around $29,600.\n\nThe developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. Since its inception, a total of 19,445,656 BTCs have been mined, which is the circulating supply of Bitcoin. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains.\n\nXRP price is likely to rally to the $0.68 mark, over 10% gains from the current level. The altcoin could find support at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.59, in the event of a decline.\n\nXRP price is in an uptrend in November 2023. The altcoin is on track to extend its gains, with the recent developments in the altcoin. XRP price eyes the 50% retracement level of the decline from the July 13 top of $0.93 to Aug 17 low of $0.42.\n\nXRP price sustained above the $0.60 mark, early on Tuesday. The altcoin is in an uptrend, amidst rising capital inflow from institutional investors to XRP funds. Over the past three weeks, large wallet investors have distributed their XRP token holdings, and retail traders have scooped up the altcoin, supporting a bullish thesis.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "How Ripple is trying to reach new audiences - American Banker",
        "content": "Ripple is looking to make blockchain tech easy to use for a non-technical audience, says Brendan Berry, the company's head of payments products. Ripple\n\nRipple has been successful at using the technology that supports the XRP token to boost international payments, a strategy that it's trying to expand through upgrading its payments platform, partnerships and digital asset projects.\n\nIn November, the firm recast its RippleNet platform as Ripple Payments. This system supports blockchain-powered international business payments without requiring users to have expertise in digital currencies or transaction processing.\n\nRipple is trying to make itself more competitive in the cross-border B2B payments market. B2B payments have become a major battleground, with JPMorgan Chase recently debuting a product that uses blockchain technology to support \"programmable\" B2B payments, and Wise and Visa partnering with the Swift messaging system to battle fintechs that offer digital B2B payments.\n\nThe newly-dubbed Ripple Payments provides access to Ripple's global network of more than 70 crypto and traditional payment markets. It also includes a built-in compliance system that uses more than 30 licenses, such as money transmitter licenses in the U.S. and a recent license form the Monetary Authority of Singapore . Ripple Payments also enables onboarding via the XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange, which is designed to make it easier for users to access different sources of liquidity.\n\nRipple's licenses are key to reaching a wider range of users, according to Brendan Berry, head of payments products at Ripple.\n\n\"Previously, the impact that our payments solution provided was limited to the types of customers we could serve, which were primarily licensed financial institutions,\" Berry said. \"With the licensed solution, we're able to serve a broader base of corporates who want someone to manage their payments flows end to end.\"\n\nRipple Payments has made new integrations with the XRP Ledger's native decentralized exchange, with a simpler user interface.\n\n\"This is geared toward providing the speedy processing and cross-border availability of a blockchain-enabled payment system without requiring one to have any expertise in the underlying technology,\" he said.\n\nRipple anticipates that Ripple Payments will be used to support digital invoices for imports, exports and international supply-chain payments. Other uses include payroll processing for staff or contractors.\n\n\"This will greatly enhance our ability to offer optionality, speed, ease of use, and compliance among a number of cross-border payments needs,\" Berry said.\n\nRipple Payments followed several other deployments. In early November, Ripple partnered with African fintech Onafriq to support digital asset-enabled cross-border payments between Africa and the Gulf Cooperation Council (an economic union including Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman). Ripple and Onafriq's partnership will also include the U.K. and Australia. Onafriq is using Ripple Payments to open corridors among these nations to cut transfer times. Other payment firms have also made substantial investments in Africa, including Visa, which pledged to invest $1 billion in Africa by 2027.\n\nThe total transaction value in Africa's digital payments market is on pace to reach about $146 billion in 2023 and $265 billion by 2027, according to Statista .\n\n\"Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has demonstrated strong market dynamics for crypto adoption, with consumers using digital assets for trading and for protection against fiat inflation,\" Berry said.\n\nRipple also recently entered a partnership with the Web3 financial platform provider Uphold . Web3 encompasses blockchain-powered technology that supports new uses for cryptocurrency, such as NFTs and the metaverse \u2014 both in early-stage use in financial services. \"Uphold's trading architecture makes it easy to move value between fiat and crypto and across networks, and provides access from a wide range of crypto liquidity venues globally,\" Berry said.\n\nThese moves stack on top of products launched earlier in 2023. In June, Ripple released its CBDC Platform , which aims to spot uses for central bank digital currencies or stablecoins at commercial and central banks. Ripple hopes to use its position as an enabler of cross-border transactions to forge a role in CBDCs, which will need some kind of bridge technology to work in different countries.\n\nVisa and Mastercard are also attempting to play a similar role for stablecoins and CBDCs.\n\n\"Cross-border payments are the primary use case for cryptocurrencies, and of those, the stablecoins have a natural advantage because they do not introduce Bitcoin-level value fluctuations,\" said Aaron McPherson, principal AFM Consulting. XRP's value does fluctuate, but under sufficiently fast timescales that may not be an issue, McPherson said, noting that the CBDC Platform probably makes Ripple flexible enough to work with any stablecoin. \"[Ripple] clearly sees the opportunity, they want to be the exchange,\" McPherson said.\n\nOne challenge Ripple could have is the persistent question of whether XRP is an investment asset or a medium of exchange, McPherson said, referring to Ripple's long dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission over how XRP should be regulated. Ripple did not provide comment on that dispute for this article.\n\n\"Ripple's prospects for working with CBDC pilots are probably hurt by the ongoing SEC case, because central banks will not want the legal uncertainty,\" McPherson said. \"Hopefully, that is resolved soon so that things can move forward.\"\n\n"

        "title": "Ripple effects of climate change have created a 'new ocean' - Earth.com",
        "content": "The impact of climate change on marine ecosystems is becoming increasingly complex. A recent study offers a new perspective on how climate change and local temperature fluctuations interact to affect marine life.\n\nStudy co-author Jon Witman, a professor of Biology at Brown University, emphasized the importance of understanding both the steady warming trend and local temperature variability.\n\nHow organisms adapt\n\nWitman collaborated with Andrew Pershing of Climate Central and John Bruno from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe researchers investigated how marine communities adapt to both gradual and variable changes, reviewing processes that either facilitate or hinder adaptation.\n\nStudying climate and the ocean\n\n\u201cGreenhouse gas emissions are warming the ocean with profound consequences at all levels of organization, from organismal rates to ecosystem processes. The proximate driver is an interplay between anthropogenic warming (the trend) and natural fluctuations in local temperature,\u201d wrote the study authors.\n\n\u201cThese two properties cause anomalously warm events such as marine heatwaves to occur with increasing frequency and magnitude.\u201d\n\nTemperature fluctuations\n\nHowever, the interaction between the steadily warming climate and the spikes in local temperatures tends to be underappreciated, said Witman.\n\n\u201cClimate change studies often focus on the trend of global warming. But organisms in the ocean are also experiencing temperature fluctuations, and that\u2019s less studied and therefore less understood,\u201d explained Witman.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to add more reality into ocean climate change studies by considering both the smooth, upward trend of climate warming as well as the variability on top of that trend.\u201d\n\nLocal conditions\n\n\u201cMarine communities are made up of species that are adapted to the prevailing local conditions. Thermal conditions can be characterized by the mean temperature, the amplitude of the annual cycle, and the interannual variability,\u201d wrote the researchers.\n\n\u201cThese characteristics of ocean temperature strongly influence countless aspects of the physiology and ecology of marine organisms, the composition and diversity of marine communities, and even the structure and dynamics of marine food webs.\u201d\n\nAbrupt heat spikes\n\nThe research highlights that while marine organisms like coral attempt to adapt to gradually rising temperatures, they are also subjected to abrupt spikes, like heat waves, which have dire consequences.\n\nThese heat spikes can lead to consequences like coral bleaching, where stressed corals expel algae and turn white, potentially leading to death if conditions don\u2019t improve.\n\nWitman pointed to the increased incidence of such events in regions like the Mediterranean, which have seen significant coral bleaching and death.\n\nTemporal ocean climate variation\n\n\u201cAspects of temporal variation such as the frequency of repeated temperature anomalies and delays in ecological changes (legacy effects) following anomalies are central to understanding the different ecological impacts of climate change. These processes can either accelerate or slow the rate of change and adaptation,\u201d wrote the researchers.\n\n\u201cThere is growing evidence that sessile organisms like corals in more variable thermal habitats are more resistant to thermal anomalies via ecological hardening.\u201d\n\nVulnerable ecosystems\n\nExtreme events such as heat waves may alter or damage marine ecosystems in ways that leave them more vulnerable to both progressive climate change as well as the next temperature fluctuation, Witman added.\n\nA more realistic model may help scientists better identify areas where coral is more likely to die off in an extreme event leaving coral-dependent organisms at risk over time, he said.\n\nVariable events\n\nWitman said the responses to variable events like heat waves compound (and are compounded by) the effects caused by rapidly and steadily increasing ocean temperatures.\n\nThe study highlights the necessity of considering both steady and variable changes in climate studies.\n\n\u201cIf we just study how organisms respond to the smooth trend, we miss all the variability, which is driving ecological change,\u201d Witman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of worsening physiological stress over time; there are also variable events that have their own ripple effects.\u201d\n\nSmooth and spiky\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this review is to advance our understanding of how marine ecosystems have changed and will change in response to climate change,\u201d wrote the researchers.\n\n\u201cWe are specifically interested in understanding the limitations of current approaches and identifying experimental, conceptual, and theoretical approaches necessary to understand the new ocean.\u201d\n\n\u201cA key theme of our review is that climate change in the ocean is both smooth and spiky. By smooth, we mean that there are clear temperature trends driving change. For example, Harris et al. interpreted warming as a press perturbation. By spiky, we mean that there is natural, inherent variability on top of the trend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe smooth trends and spikes from variability interact, and understanding how processes within organisms and communities filter these interactions is the key to understanding how marine ecosystems will change over the next century.\u201d\n\nRegions of concern\n\nA global model developed by the team pinpointed regions of particular concern in the Gulf of Maine, the Caribbean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. In these areas, there are high probabilities of exceptional warming events and \u201cecological surprises,\u201d wrote the study authors.\n\n\u201cThese areas, especially, warrant investigation to improve our understanding of what\u2019s going to happen in the future \u2013 as well as our conception of what we\u2019re calling, \u2018the new ocean,\u2019\u201d said Witman.\n\nFuture modeling\n\n\u201cPublished models of species range changes assume a smooth future of gradual change where species declines are due to the trend rather than infrequent extremes (variance), they do not consider geographic variability in temporal variability, and they assume that dispersal and range expansion are smooth (and largely unlimited),\u201d wrote the study authors.\n\n\u201cFuture modeling efforts need to incorporate these aspects in order to make more realistic predictions.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuture marine climate change ecology should consider both the temperature trend and inherent temperature variability, how they interact to exceed thresholds producing extreme events, and how they vary regionally to affect individuals, populations, and communities.\u201d\n\nThe study is published in the journal Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematic.\n\n\u2014\n\nLike what you read?

        "title": "How Consumer Behavior Trends Determine Online Retail Success | Santiago Gallino - Knowledge@Wharton",
        "content": "Transcript\n\nHow Are Retail and Consumer Behavior Trends Changing?\n\nDan Loney: With all the new technology, it feels like we\u2019re in a process right now where retail has really changed a lot, for the betterment of the public, I think.\n\nSantiago Gallino: Yes, I agree. And I think this is not new to retail. Retail, if you think of it as an industry, is constantly evolving. What is new, and probably what you\u2019re pointing to, is the pace. The changes that we\u2019re seeing in the retail industry require the companies and the consumers to keep up, to stay relevant, and be successful.\n\nLoney: You talk about two aspects there, one being the consumer, the other being the company. Let me start with the consumer, because right now the expectation of the consumer is better, faster, and the experience has to be as good as possible.\n\nGallino: Yes. I think that\u2019s probably what is driving most of the changes. I think that the consumer expectations are as high as ever. This is in part because companies have been making a lot of changes that benefit consumers. I think we\u2019re at an interesting point because retailers now need to look back and make sure they\u2019re able to make a profit while fulfilling those expectations, and sometimes exceeding those expectations. If you focus on online retailing, there was a lot of effort to get things faster. More assortment. Free returns. All of these things are great for consumers. They\u2019re very happy. But we are starting to see that some retailers are struggling to see how they can sustain some of these things. I think it\u2019s interesting, what\u2019s going to happen next in terms of keeping the consumer happy, keeping them engaged, but also being aware of, what is the bottom line of the business?\n\nLoney: How has that changed the overall mindset of the company in terms of delivering all of that?\n\nGallino: I think that today the companies need to be smarter about the different offerings that they give to consumers. Like you were mentioning, these high expectations can be composed of a lot of different parts. Some of those parts are essential to the consumer, and some are nice to have.\n\nIn recent years, one thing that we\u2019ve seen from retailers is that they also became more sophisticated in their analytics capability. The way they mine into the data that consumers are providing to them, to be able to make these [decisions]. What are those things that need to happen? And what are those things where they can be a little bit sloppy or relax the standards and still have the customer being happy, and they are able to make a profit out of it?\n\nTechnological Developments in Retail\n\nLoney: From a technological standpoint, we\u2019ve made great leaps in the last two decades or so. But it still feels like we have a long way to go. There will be more advancements, AI being maybe the next one, as we move forward over the next few decades.\n\nGallino: I think it\u2019s a moving target, right? The transition to online retailing happened many years ago. But now, more than 40% of the transactions happen from smartphones. And that put another stress into, how do I interact with the consumer? Now he\u2019s seeing my assortment, interacting with my company, in a smaller screen, on-the-go while commuting. Which is something that is different from what the online experience was maybe five, 10 years ago.\n\nLoney: When you think about the operational side, then you have to focus on the website, the accessibility of all the different products that people are looking for, the speed at which that website takes you through that process. Because if the consumer doesn\u2019t have that optimum experience, then you\u2019re potentially talking about lost consumer, lost revenue to the company longer term.\n\nGallino: That\u2019s right. In fact, we worked with some colleagues on a paper that actually looks at that. We found that a 10% slowdown on website speed can cause 4% lower sales and 2% reduction in conversion. It\u2019s interesting. But connecting to what I was mentioning before, we also look at how that impact of speed is different in the different steps of the customer journey. It\u2019s not the same if you have a slowdown when you land on the page, when you are searching for the product, compared to when the website slows down at the checkout point.\n\nIn fact, at the checkout point, slowdowns are much more damaging to the customer experience. And this is what I was mentioning, that the company needs to be smart. Because it\u2019s not that you can say, \u201cWell, in the real world, I want to make my whole website be faster and more efficient.\u201d Sometimes that can be too expensive. So, being smart about where to put your investment and where to put the focus can be critical.\n\nLoney: What about the delivery after that purchase is made? That\u2019s been a big focus of a lot of companies. Amazon is probably the one that has made the biggest investments in terms of making sure that last mile is vital.\n\nGallino: I think that\u2019s an interesting question. Because I think that many retailers, for the last few years, have been chasing Amazon in this effort. Amazon has been amazing at achieving that customer service, sometimes exceeding expectations, in terms of delivery speed. But my experience and my research show that it is not a blank policy that should apply to all product categories or even to all customer circumstances. There are some customers that are more planning in their purchases, so they\u2019re happy to wait two, three, four days. On the operational side, that has a huge impact. It\u2019s not the same cost, not the same stress to the supply chain to deliver something the next hour, the next day, then a week from now. Sometimes the same customer is willing to change one or the other. Now, we are seeing retailers offering those options. The customer expressed the option, and with that, I think it\u2019s an opportunity for a win-win.\n\nLoney: It\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019ve also seen companies push out the length of where they want to see that consumer think about holiday shopping. In many cases, it\u2019s into early October.\n\nGallino: Yes, indeed. The holidays put a stress test to all the operations. In terms of the delivery options, and also in the store execution. Some of the peak in stress on the online basis is because many retailers start to stock out in the physical stores. Customers that are looking for a particular doll or a particular toy for their kids, they really stress out and start to put those orders online. I think that, in part, is a manifestation of this challenge that retailers have to have a coordinated strategy both online and in stores.\n\nI think it\u2019s important for those retailers to keep in mind that customers are omnichannel. In that sense, it is a fictitious effort to try to characterize a particular customer as an online customer or brick-and-mortar customer. We are all omnichannel. We walk in the store with our phone in hand. We leave the story empty-handed because we know that we can order when we are at home. Or the other way around. We are at home. We find something we like. We say, \u201cI\u2019m going to go to the store and check it out.\u201d Retailers need to be aware of this because the customers will arrive to the store with a lot more experience and knowledge about the product, because they have been searching and finding information online before they arrive.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Future of Retail?\n\nLoney: Is there potential for more disruption in retail as we move down the road?\n\nGallino: I think we haven\u2019t seen all the disruption roll out. There are still retailers that will be able to navigate successfully, and to inform and convert. That\u2019s always my hope. I like to see companies being able to reinvent themselves. Unfortunately, we\u2019re going to see some more disruptions and some big players failing. This is the nature of retail. And this goes back to what we talked about at the beginning, that retail, by its own nature, is constantly evolving. That\u2019s why it\u2019s fun for me to do research on this industry.\n\nLoney: What do you think it means for bricks-and-mortar in the retail sector? Because it does feel like they can stay viable, even with the online component.\n\nGallino: Absolutely. There are two parts of that. One is that finding customers online is getting more and more expensive. When the companies do the math, the physical store becomes an attractive and viable way to make your brand known to customers, have the opportunity to attract new customers, compared to what is these days more expensive \u2014 eyeballs on the internet.\n\nThe other part, what I think is the interesting component, is that brick-and-mortar has the opportunity to bring that experience to the customer that is possible, but harder, to do online. The retailers that have been successful these days are those that, in their own category, with their own constraints, have been able to bring that experiential component to the customer who wants to travel to the store because he likes to navigate the aisles and find those deals there, who likes to interact with the customers in the store, like peers buying and searching for products, and have that discovery exercise. Or simply because it\u2019s much more efficient to go there, find what I want, and get out of there as soon as I can. The experience has different flavors, but I think that that experiential component is key these days.\n\nLoney: But doesn\u2019t it make it even more challenging when you think about this from a generational standpoint? The younger generations are digital, with bricks-and-mortar as a sidepiece, it feels like.\n\nGallino: That\u2019s true. In talking to many retailers, they had pointed to something that I think is very interesting. The new generation is much more digital, much more invested in their online experience. For that reason, when they go to the store the human contact can have a huge impact. Because if you\u2019re having a coffee with friends, you are more of an older generation. You constantly talk to people and interact. But the younger generation, maybe they have a handful of conversations with real people a day. And that\u2019s why the impact of that conversation, if it\u2019s well-planned and in a nice context in a store, can have a much better impact.\n\nLoney: Is it a surprise, then, when you see some companies, Warby Parker being one, that start out online but bring in the bricks-and-mortar component a little bit later?\n\nGallino: No. To me, it makes complete sense. Many of those companies that started online, at the beginning they were arguing they will never go offline. There was no need for brick-and-mortar. But then they discovered that with the right strategy, they can combine the best of both worlds. Some of them have a ball with a physical presence that is like a showroom, so they don\u2019t need to carry inventory because they want to have focus on the experiential component. Bonobos is an example. But Warby Parker, the same way. I think that it is not a competition between the two. It\u2019s just to try to find the right balance and ultimately make a profitable proposition to the customers.\n\nLoney: Doesn\u2019t that also put a focus making sure they are as efficient as possible? Because it feels like we\u2019re at a point right now where retailers, if they make a mistake, it\u2019s very hard for them to come back from it.\n\nGallino: Absolutely. I was talking with a retailer yesterday, and we came to the conclusion that with all these changes, with all the innovation, it\u2019s still true that retail is detail. This is something that was true 100 years ago, and it\u2019s true today. And this is exactly your point. I think that execution is key. Because in many industries, the margins are big. Retail, with all these competitive forces, all the changes, tend to have very thin margins. So, it\u2019s a story where details are key.\n\nLoney: Where does retail have to go in the years ahead?\n\nGallino: I think that the years ahead should put a focus on these details. For many companies, there\u2019s been a rush to offer everything to the customer without thinking, \u201cCan we sustain this over time? Can we be profitable with this? Do customers really need all this that they\u2019re asking?\u201d Now that the retailers are extremely rich in data, they can be able to walk back and see, what are these details that they need to tweak to make the company successful?\n\nGoing forward, we\u2019re going to see more of these changes that will tweak things in order to make the company more efficient and hopefully translate those efficiencies to the customers. One example is returns. I think that online returns are a pain point for any online retailer. And I think that it\u2019s being very generous, the policy. But many companies are starting to revisit that and see how they can still keep customers happy but without being na\u00efve about the whole process.\n\nLoney: Are more companies finding those little areas where maybe they change the philosophy a bit and it helps their bottom line, but it doesn\u2019t have any significant impact on the relationship with the consumer?\n\nGallino: Yes, I think so. One other area that I hope we see more changes is in staffing. If you think about the two main investments that retailers have, it\u2019s their inventory\u2014 the assortment that they carry\u2014 and the people in the store. With this call for an experiential component, many retailers should rethink how they train, they retain, and they keep their own staff being able to provide that high experience that customers are expecting."
