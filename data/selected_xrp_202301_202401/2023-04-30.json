With Ripple\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), both banks can enable instant settlements using XRP, doing away with the need for conventional correspondent banking relationships and the costs and delays that go along with them.\n\nadvertisement\n\nChinaBank discussed their #Ripple use with QNB for remittances from Qatar to the Philippines in their latest annual report.https://t.co/YvHrbewR7C pic.twitter.com/KjaXuHom94 \u2014 WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) April 29, 2023\n\nAccording to the announcement, customers can effortlessly open an OKS Account with no initial deposit by using the China Bank START app on their smartphone.\n\nInterestingly, QNB serves as Ripple\u2019s principal partner in the MENA region. In 2021, the bank announced a partnership with Ripple as part of its plan to swiftly improve cross-border payments and remittance services.\n\nUltimately, the collaboration between ChinaBank and QNB in utilizing Ripple\u2019s ODL, emphasizes the rising popularity of blockchain-based solutions in the international remittance sector.\n\nRipple\u2019s ODL Payment Solution\n\nRipple\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) payment solution uses digital assets, such as XRP, to enable real-time cross-border payments. It functions by first converting one currency into XRP, and then converting that XRP into the desired currency.\n\nThrough this method, the need for conventional correspondent banking relationships is removed, along with the costs and delays that go along with them. In comparison to standard cross-border payment methods, ODL is a quick, effective, and affordable option.\n\nSo far, Ripple\u2019s ODL has been launched across several countries to improve payment transactions. In 2021, the payment platform expanded its services in Japan. At the time, Ripple said it hopes that the first implementation of ODL in Japan would help it accelerate the adoption of the popular tech.\n\nSimilarly, Ripple announced last year that it has expanded its ODL services to Europe, specifically to France and Sweden. According to the announcement, LemonWay, a payment service for online marketplaces based in France, will leverage RippleNet\u2019s ODL to improve its payment process by using XRP. Additionally, Swedish money transfer provider Xbaht will use ODL to provide instant and low-cost retail remittances."
