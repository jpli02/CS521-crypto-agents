        "title": "XRP Community Reacts To James K. Filan's Comment, \u201cYou're Screwed\u201d - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Filan tells an XRP fan that she\u2019s \u201cscrewed\u201d after he was asked to explain SEC\u2019s latest filings in familiar terms.\n\nSeveral XRP community members have expressed mixed reactions over a recent comment by former United States federal prosecutor attorney James K. Filan.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nIt all started after the seasoned lawyer shared the latest update on the ongoing Ripple v. SEC lawsuit, as he has always done.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn a tweet yesterday, Filan reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission had filed a supplemental authority letter supporting its pending summary judgment motion against Ripple.\n\nAs usual, the details of the SEC\u2019s recent filings seemed too difficult to comprehend for non-legal practitioners, who called on the seasoned lawyer to provide clarity. A Twitter user and XRP community member who goes by the name \u201cAnniex\u201d asked the former federal prosecutor to explain the contents of the SEC letter in the context of the web-based game Wordle.\n\n\u201cExplain it to me like I am on my last go in Wordle and only have three right letters but in the wrong boxes,\u201d Anniex requested.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAnniex talked about the game Wordle, launched in 2018; Wordle is a web-based game that gives players six attempts to guess a five-letter word. Players are given feedback after each guess, which usually comes in the form of colored lines. This feature helps indicate when the letters match the correct position. The New York Times acquired the game last year for an undisclosed seven-figure fee.\n\nResponding to Anniex request, attorney Filan said, \u201cSorry. You\u2019re screwed.\u201d\n\nSorry. You\u2019re screwed. \u2014 James K. Filan ???? (@FilanLaw) April 11, 2023\n\nFilan\u2019s Comment Sparks Reactions\n\nDespite directing his response to Anniex, the tweet has stirred mixed reactions in the XRP community. While some XRP community members understood the comment as a joke, others believe that Filan\u2019s remarks meant trouble for Ripple and the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\n?? \u2014 Zork \u1d2e\u1d3a\u1d40\u1d34 \uea00 (@Zorkwyd) April 11, 2023\n\nWow, thought you had better tact on how to explain that letter. \u2014 Carlos Del Valle (@CryptoX11) April 11, 2023\n\nFilan Clears the Misconception\n\nFilan\u2019s comment continued to stir up reactions, prompting the seasoned lawyer to clarify his earlier response.\n\nReacting to the development, Filan said his response was only directed at Anniex\u2019s Wordle-related comment and not the XRP community.\n\nMy response was only to the @amcunningx4 Wordle-related comment. \u2014 James K. Filan ???? (@FilanLaw) April 11, 2023\n\nFilan\u2019s Roles in Ripple v. SEC Case\n\nAlthough some people seemed disappointed with Filan over the comment, it does not remove the fact that the defense lawyer wants the same thing as the rest of the community members- a win for Ripple.\n\nFilan has taken it as a responsibility to share updates related to the ongoing lawsuit. Aside from sharing Ripple v. SEC updates, Filan has also circulated tweets criticizing the SEC from top Ripple executives, especially the company\u2019s general counsel Stuart Alderoty.\n\nRecall that Filan had predicted that Judge Torres would issue a ruling on the case before the end of March 2023. However, his prediction did not pass, leaving many XRP and Ripple supporters disappointed."

More to the point, who owns the most ripple out of all the players in the crypto market? Let\u2019s take a look and see what we can find out.\n\nWhat is Ripple (XRP)?\n\nBefore we do that, though, let\u2019s take a quick look at what XRP does and how XRP works.\n\nRipple Labs was founded to, in effect, speed up international money transfers. There is even a belief in certain quarters that it will end up replacing the current Swift/BIC system of international bank transfers. In terms of the XRP coin itself, it can be used to transfer assets on the Ripple network and it can also be bought, sold and traded on crypto exchanges.\n\nRipple was founded in 2012 by programmer Jed McCaleb and entrepreneur Chris Larsen. Larsen still serves as Ripple Labs executive chairman and the company\u2019s CEO is Brad Westinghouse.\n\nUnlike a lot of other cryptocurrencies, XRP only lets approved users validate transactions. That makes it a bit more centralised than other cryptos, but does allow it to be more secure, at least in theory.\n\nSomething that makes XRP stand out is that there is some debate as to whether it can be described as being based on a blockchain. This is because the Ripple ledger does not involve either mining or staking. Instead, every single one of the 100 billion XRP that will ever exist has been created by Ripple and is held by the company, with a certain amount released onto the open market every month. As of 12 April 2023, there were 51,688,470,797 in circulation. It is worth noting at this stage that there was a total supply of 99,989,014,677, indicating that a little under 11 million XRP had been burned, or destroyed, at one time or another.\n\nAnyway, with that all out of the way, let\u2019s take a look and see if we can find out more about who has the most ripple.\n\nWho owns the most ripple?\n\nRipple price history from launch to present - Credit: CoinMarketCap\n\nOne important thing to remember at this stage is that, because one of the key selling points of cryptocurrency is its anonymity, we cannot say with any certainty exactly who owns the most XRP. That said, there are some potential clues as to who the wallets which hold the largest amount of XRP could be linked to.\n\nAnyway, data supplied by the CoinCarp website said that, as of 12 April 2023, there were 4,559,305 wallets which held XRP. The site suggested that the two top holders of ripple were wallets controlled by Ripple Labs itself. This should probably not come as too much of a surprise, considering that, as we have already explained, XRP is held by Ripple Labs and then released onto the open market. The site\u2019s statistics suggested that the wallet with the most XRP held 1,960,027,012 ripple coins, worth about $983m at the time of writing and comprising 1.96% of the maximum supply of the crypto. Likewise, the wallet with the second most ripple held 1,765,294,075, the equivalent of a little over $885m and about 1.765% of the maximum supply.\n\nMoving down the list, the site said that the third largest amount of XRP was in a wallet linked to the Binance (BNB) crypto exchange. This wallet held around 1.48% of the total amount of XRP, with 1,477,168,712 ripple coins. Perhaps more interestingly, the fourth largest XRP wallet appears to be an individual\u2019s, holding 1,376,176,324 ripple, worth about $697m.\n\nGoing a bit further, the site claimed that the top 10 holders of ripple owned 10.81% of the maximum supply of XRP, with the top 20 accounting for 15.92%, the top 50 26.43% and the top 100 32.86% of the total amount of ripple.\n\nOne thing we should note here is that, according to CoinCarp\u2019s data, there are at least 100 wallets with more than 200 million ripple coins. That means, at least in theory, that there are hundreds of XRP millionaires, but not any confirmed ripple billionaires. Something that we need to mention is that it is always possible that someone has $1bn worth of XRP across several wallets. However, we cannot name the individual who owns the most ripple with any certainty. It is worth noting that, in 2018, Forbes reported that Larsen held 5.19 billion XRP in his personal wallet. It is unclear either whether this report was accurate, or what had happened to Larsen\u2019s holdings.\n\nSo that might help explain, if not precisely who owns the most ripple, then at least where the largest sums of XRP can be found. Remember that that question is, due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency, getting a handle as to who precisely owns what can be tricky. Nevertheless, despite the relatively high concentration of large investors in XRP, it is important to remember the following things if you are looking at possibly investing in the ripple cryptocurrency. First, make sure to do your own research. Second, remember that cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile and prices can go down as well as up. Finally, never invest more money than you can afford to lose.\n\nFAQs"
