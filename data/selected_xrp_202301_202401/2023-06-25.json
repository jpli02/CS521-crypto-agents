        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Three people were killed and one victim is in the hospital after a shooting in Broad Ripple early Sunday morning, according to Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nThe shooting occurred just after 2 a.m in the 800 block of Broad Ripple Avenue. According to police, the shooting happened on the sidewalk near Jimmy John's.\n\nIMPD officers who were already in the area said they responded to shots fired. They quickly arrived and found four victims who had been shot. Police said a male and female were shot and pronounced dead by paramedics on the scene.\n\nTwo other male and female victims were transported to the hospital. Police said one victim was on life support and was later pronounced dead by hospital staff. Another victim is stable and expected to live.\n\nIMPD said there is nobody in custody for the shooting.

        "content": "Around 2:30 a.m. Sunday morning, officers found four people shot in the 800 block of Broad Ripple Avenue, which is right near Carrollton Avenue.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Three people are dead and one person was wounded in a shooting in Broad Ripple overnight.\n\nIMPD officers were already in the area when they heard shots around 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, June 25. They rushed to the 800 block of Broad Ripple Avenue, which is right near Carrollton Avenue, where they found four people who had been shot.\n\nThe Marion County Coroner's Office identified the three people who were killed: Tywain Henning, 24; Kaleyia Preer, 22; and Christopher Lee Wilson Jr., 19.\n\nPolice said a 21-year-old woman who was shot was taken to a hospital and is expected to recover.\n\nPolice did not release any information on suspects, but they believe one or more individuals were involved. IMPD said it made an arrest in the area after the shootings, but it was unrelated.\n\nThey are asking businesses and people living nearby the shooting scene to check their surveillance cameras.\n\nThe Broad Ripple Village Association has asked the mayor's office to designate Broad Ripple as a gun-free zone on Friday and Saturday nights. Mayor Joe Hogsett said if the request is approved, it will go into effect next weekend.\n\nHogsett said in 2012, the city had about 50,000 active gun permits. He said since then, the numbers have exploded.\n\n\"This year we are on pace to end the year with nearly 160,000 active gun permits. And that's after the state legislature took action to allow permitless guns to be carried in our city,\" Hogsett said.\n\nThe mayor said the city is working to identify problem property owners in Broad Ripple and the mayor's office and prosecutor's office will be meeting with those owners and will hold them accountable.\n\nHogsett's Republican challenger in the November election, Jefferson Shreve, issued a statement which reads in part:\n\nI am in favor of any practical and effective measure to get guns out of Broad Ripple at night. Employing technology to prevent guns from entering public spaces where crowds mix with alcohol is a worthwhile endeavor. As usual, it is hard to disagree with the sentiment the Mayor sets forth, but the substance and execution are sorely lacking.\n\n\n\nResidents and business owners agree weekend loitering on the streets outside the Broad Ripple establishments is the source of violence. This is not new; last night was not a random occurrence. Yet today we learned the city has \u201cbegun\u201d the process of engaging with problem businesses to correct this loitering.\n\n\n\nIt is remarkable how many anti-crime initiatives are \u201cbegun\u201d during an election year for this election-year mayor. Finger pointing supplants practical steps like additional cameras in places like Broad Ripple Avenue, or hiring a public safety director to ensure accountability across city government.\n\nAnyone with information about the shooting should contact Detective James Hurt at the IMPD Homicide Office at 317-327-3475 or email him at James.Hurt@indy.gov . People can also call Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at 317-262-8477 (TIPS)."

        "title": "Indianapolis crime: Broad Ripple goes gun-free after deadly shooting - IndyStar",
        "content": "Indianapolis Star\n\nBroad Ripple Village Association leadership is requesting a gun-free zone for Friday and Saturday nights through Aug. 31.\n\nBoard member Kip Tew announced the request Sunday at a news conference after a deadly shooting hours earlier while hundreds of people were in the entertainment district.\n\n\"We grieve those lost and injured; it is unimaginable and horrific that this has happened,\" said Kendale Adams, deputy chief with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nAs Mayor Joe Hogsett expressed frustration with state legislation that has prevented Indianapolis from banning guns in entertainment districts, police shared an early look of how gun-free zone enforcement would work and reiterated extra protection measures they've implemented so far.\n\nConsider a digital subscription:6 reasons to subscribe to IndyStar and help us tell Indy's stories\n\nWhat we know about Sunday's shooting\n\nShortly after 2 a.m. Sunday, police reported finding four people in their early to mid-20s with gunshot wounds in the 800 block of Broad Ripple Avenue near Guilford Avenue. A man and woman were pronounced dead at the scene, and another man and woman were taken to hospitals in serious condition, according to a news release. The other man died at the hospital, IMPD announced Sunday evening.\n\nA disturbance likely preceded the shooting.\n\nAt the late-morning news conference, Adams said police did not have information on the victims' plans that evening.\n\nTwo firearms were collected at the scene, Adams said. Detectives believe one or more people may be involved but need more information to confirm. They are requesting surveillance footage from the area and that witnesses contact Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at 317-262-8477 and homicide detective James Hurt at 317-327-3475 or James.Hurt@indy.gov.\n\n'Gun-free' zones, bans:Indy Mayor wants to curb firearm access in city\n\nMeasures police have taken so far to stem violence in Broad Ripple\n\nSeeing 400 to 500 people gather around the main Broad Ripple strip is not unusual, said Chris Bailey, assistant chief of police, on Sunday.\n\n\"You have a lot of people who don't go into bars. They are literally just hanging out,\" Adams said. \"That continues to be a problem because then you mix alcohol and you mix personal conflict, and it really becomes a challenge to try to police that with several hundred people.\"\n\nPeople are walking around with handguns while drinking in the streets and on sidewalks in Broad Ripple, Bailey said.\n\n\"None of those things are illegal,\" he said.\n\nBroad Ripple has seen an increased police presence so far because of complaints from businesses and the Broad Ripple Village Association, Hogsett said. Other measures include officers working overtime, being employed by certain establishments, nuisance abatement and working with private parking lot owners, police said.\n\nPolice also are working with troubled establishments, Adams said. He declined to identify the businesses, citing ongoing efforts to reach agreements, and noted that some around the city have improved. Hogsett said business owners who are acting irresponsibly will be held to account.\n\nThe mayor said he respected the Second Amendment but decried what he called the state's \"weak gun laws,\" and specifically permitless carry.\n\n\"If I had the ability to keep guns off of Broad Ripple Avenue on Friday and Saturday nights, I would do it right now,\" Hogsett said. \"But our state legislature has seen fit to ensure that I do not have the authority to do that.\"\n\nHow gun-free zone enforcement will work\n\nThe city can't unilaterally say that Broad Ripple is gun free, said Matt Giffin, corporation counsel for the city of Indianapolis.\n\n\"There's a carve-out in state law that says when private organizations are hosting or promoting events on public property ... that they can make and enforce their own rules,\" Giffin said.\n\nHogsett announced the city's intention to help enforce gun-free zone requests in late May, and he said the city has encouraged civic, neighborhood and private organizations that host crowded events to do so.\n\nGroups like the Broad Ripple Village Association hoping to host an event at a public place could request a gun-free zone via the city's permitting process. The city would then help with enforcement, which includes containing the area and using advanced screening technology.\n\nThe exact details of the Broad Ripple enforcement, which would begin next weekend if the permit is approved, are yet to be announced, Bailey said.\n\nIndianapolis killings:Tracking every homicide in 2023\n\nWhen asked if a gun-free zone would have prevented Sunday's shooting, Hogsett referenced last weekend's major music festival.\n\n\"A gun-free zone, if implemented appropriately, would have the same effect in Broad Ripple that it did just a week ago in Garfield Park for the WonderRoad Music Festival.\"\n\nCall the reporter at 317-444-7339."

If the platform itself is in trouble, its customers might not repay the loans they took for those products, fear lenders.The Reserve Bank of India has been keeping a close watch on the exposure of lenders towards the edtech sector. Sources told ET that many NBFCs were questioned by the central bank a couple of months back about the credit they had extended in this space.Several large lenders took steps to reduce their exposure. Many of their fintech partners became cautious too. But the problem was that a significant number of loans had been disbursed already and quite a few lenders had reasonable exposure in this area. They are now keeping a close track of repayment trends.Byju\u2019s has been accused of mis-selling its products on credit . Fintech lender CapitalFloat had faced massive defaults after many unsuspecting customers of Byju\u2019s were sold products on credit without proper explanations. However, industry insiders feel that this time such problems will not be that hard to contain.Close on the heels of its erstwhile auditor Deloitte Haskins walking off, Byju\u2019s has promised its investors that it will file the FY21-22 financial results by September, sources have told ETtech.The edtech major filed its FY21 financial results in September 2022, after a delay of 18 months. The results revealed a larger drop in revenues than expected, and losses had swelled as well. The company reported revenues of Rs 2,280 crore along with a loss of Rs 4,588 crore, up from just Rs 262 crore in the previous fiscal. One of the key changes that Byju\u2019s had to make in its FY20-21 results was to report revenues for only the period under consideration \u2014 fiscal 2021\u2014 and not include multi-year payments.According to a shareholder who spoke to ETtech, Byju\u2019s told its investors that \u201cthe exit of Deloitte (Byju\u2019s\u2019 former audit firm) and three board members was not coordinated\u2019\u2019. Last Thursday, ETtech broke the story about three of Byju\u2019s\u2019 board members resigning . These investors were the representatives of Peak XV Partners, Prosus, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.Byju\u2019s employees have voiced their concerns about the uncertainty of their jobs and the company\u2019s ability to sustain its operations. Staffers at the Bengaluru-based firm, which recently laid off another 500-1000 employees, have been struggling with increased workload after the staff-cuts.Sales professionals at the Tencent-backed firm have been reaching out to prospective buyers of K-12 and test prep products with discounted offers, where they themselves bear the cost partially so as to meet internal targets, ETtech has learnt.Trouble with its year-old joint venture (JV) partner Vedanta has pushed Taiwanese contract manufacturing firm Foxconn to hunt for a new collaborator in India to further its semiconductor manufacturing ambitions in the country, multiple sources told ET.\u201cThere are differences between the two. We have been in touch with both, and have suggested that Foxconn on-board a new partner\u2019\u2019, a senior government official told ET. The gov ernment is concerned about the \u201cfinancial stability\u201d of the Vedanta group, the official added. However, they added that it is ultimately Foxconn\u2019s call who they partner with.Vedanta Resources Ltd (VRL), the parent entity of Vedanta Limited, recently pledged equity to raise $450 million from two of its principal rivals \u2014 Trafigura and Glencore \u2014 to repay debt. This, analysts say, underlines the dire financial straits of the promoters and their inability to tap more traditional sources of funding.Vedanta Group, which is the lead partner in Vedanta Foxconn Semiconductors Limited (VFSL), holds 67% stake in the JV, with Foxconn holding the rest.The Vedanta Group, however, maintained that its partnership with Foxconn is intact. \u201cThere is no change in the status of our JV. Vedanta is in a very comfortable position with respect to meeting its debt obligations\u2019\u2019, a spokesperson for the company told ET.ETtech had reported earlier that the government had asked Vedanta-Foxconn to onboard a technology partner which has a manufacturing-grade licence. ET had also reported that the government had asked Foxconn to take the lead in the JV. Even though your Instagram handles are filled with successful influencers and creators with hundreds and thousands of followers, startups managing them are barely surviving Industry officials said that about half a dozen startups in this space \u2014 which have raised more than $12 million in funding \u2014 have shut shop, while many others have pivoted or gotten acquired in fire sales over the last 12-18 months.Fan patronage startup PenCircle has shut down, its co-founder Jayan Nair confirmed to ETtech. Nithin Kamath-backed community monetisation platform StreamAnchor is \u201coperationally inactive\u201d, sources said. Qorner, a fintech platform for digital creators, last posted on Instagram in April 2022.Community management platform Scenes \u2014 which offers tools for creators to launch and manage courses \u2014 was acquired by Unacademy\u2019s Graphy in an all-cash deal. ET had reported that Protonn, a Matrix Partners-backed startup that provides audience management and monetisation tools to freelancers, shut down six months after it raised $9 million. A bunch of these companies sprung up in 2020-2021 as the pandemic gave a fillip to digital creators. Startups swiftly emerged to cater to these creators, offering solutions such as product sales, content subscriptions, and community and payment management tools.Experts believe that most of these players focused on administrative issues and not on \u201chard problems facing content creators\u201d. Also, popular platforms such as Instagram rolled out creator-centric features like shopping and subscriptions, rendering several community monetisation startups redundant.Whatever the state of the companies managing them, the influencers and creators themselves are the new heroes for younger brands who rely on them to take their products to new audiences, without breaking the bank. To stand out on cluttered social media feeds, saturated with advertisements and promotions, young brands are going beyond a one-time collaboration with digital creators.A recruitment scandal roiled IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) last weekend, where executives were found to be giving preferential treatment to certain recruiters , leading to multiple sackings and much finger-pointing. Experts warn there may be more to come HR executives told ETtech that what happened at TCS may be just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d as a lot of companies which deal with small staffing firms have such unholy nexuses at work.Experts suggested that the number of firms under scrutiny could be higher, as the investigation is currently ongoing. The incident may also spark a greater scrutiny of hiring processes within other IT firms that hire in large numbers.Experts also said that corruption in recruitment could have gone up during 2021-22, when there was accelerated demand for tech talent and attrition hit record highs.\u201cThis will make other IT companies scrutinise their hiring strategies, especially those who have rushed to meet talent requirements in recent times without a fair assessment of how that is being achieved\u2019\u2019, an HR executive said.India\u2019s $245 billion IT industry employs over 4.5 million people. During fiscal 2021-22, the top four Indian IT service firms \u2014 TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and HCLTech \u2014 hired more than 2,20,000 people, a significant number of them from campuses.Some of the small staffing companies make $1-2 million a year from IT firms, one of the sources said. Experts said that corruption in hiring is not limited to TCS or a few firms and could be the sign of a bigger rot.Vedant Lamba, founder, Mainstreet MarketplaceMumbai-based Mainstreet Marketplace, a platform for sneakerheads to buy and resell shoes, has closed a $2 million (around Rs 16 crore) seed funding round from a clutch of investors.Participants in the round include Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal\u2019s First Lap LLP, Zerodha cofounder Nikhil Kamath and Abhijeet Pai\u2019s venture fund Gruhas Proptech, Udaan co-founder Sujeet Kumar, Spotify India MD Amarjit Singh Batra, and several other angel investors and social media influencers.Founded by 24-year-old Vedant Lamba as a YouTube channel in 2017, Mainstreet Marketplace, according to Lamba, is a customer-to-business-to-customer (C2B2C) marketplace such as Olx, Spinny, CarDekho, etc., but for status-driven commodities.The platform offers brands such as Nike, Adidas, Yeezy, Supreme, Drewhouse, and claims to have an exclusive clientele comprising Bollywood celebrities such as Ranbir Kapoor, Karan Johar, Ranveer Singh, etc.According to a study by market intelligence firm Unearth Insight, India\u2019s $245 billion IT services industry employs around 3,00,000 people in sales and support functions.
