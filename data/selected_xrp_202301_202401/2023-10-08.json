        "content": "The shooting happened June 25 around 2:30 a.m. in the 800 block of Broad Ripple Avenue, near Carrollton Avenue.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The Marion County Prosecutor's Office and IMPD announced an arrest and charges in connection to a triple fatal shooting in Broad Ripple this summer.\n\nPolice arrested 24-year-old Kara Hinds for her alleged role in the incident. The Marion County Prosecutor's Office charged her with the following:\n\nTwo counts of murder\n\nOne count of reckless homicide\n\nOne count of battery by means of a deadly weapon\n\nOne count of battery resulting in serious bodily injury\n\nOne count of criminal recklessness\n\nOn June 25, IMPD officers were already in Broad Ripple when they heard gunshots around 2:30 a.m. They rushed to the 800 block of Broad Ripple Avenue, near Carrollton Avenue, where they found four people who had been shot.\n\nThe Marion County Coroner's Office identified the three people who were killed:\n\nTywain Henning, 24\n\nKaleyia Preer, 22\n\nChristopher Lee Wilson Jr., 19.\n\nPolice said a 21-year-old woman who was shot was taken to a hospital and expected to recover.\n\nAccording to court documents, an officer had broken up a disturbance an hour before the shootings that involved a large group of people \u2013 including the four that were later shot.\n\n\"There were dozens of police there they could have sought help from and say, 'Hey, I just got punched. Can you help me identify the suspect?' That didn't happen. They chose to engage with the group with a gun, and that's a problem,\" IMPD Deputy Chief Kendale Adams said.\n\nPolice were able to collect video of a fight from social media accounts and video during the time of the shootings from business surveillance systems in the area.\n\nTips to IMPD led them to identify a person of interest, who they were then able to identify on surveillance video.\n\nThat person of interest was seen carrying food containers prior to the shooting (food containers were later found at the scene of the shooting). The person of interest was also later seen in surveillance video running from the area and pointing a gun back at the area where the victims were shot.\n\nTips led police to Hinds' Facebook page. Police then got DNA results from a hat found at the shooting scene that came back as matching Hinds.\n\nOn Sept. 28, police tracked Hinds to an apartment complex and detained her. A gun was also found during the search of the apartment that matched the caliber of the one used in the shooting.\n\nAccording to court documents, while being questioned, Hinds initially denied being in Broad Ripple at the time of the shooting and then said she was.\n\n\"Several hours of video was needed to be researched, and those videos, along with bodycam, played a critical role in helping us identify Ms. Hinds as the suspect,\" Adams said.\n\nHinds allegedly told investigators she was punched in the back of the head before the shooting and might have dropped her hat and food then. Moments later, she claims she heard shots and ran.\n\nLater, police claim Hinds said she wanted to keep the caliber of the gun and how many times she fired it to herself. Hinds told investigators she was unsure if anyone was firing back at her, according to the court documents.\n\nThe gun found during the search of Hinds apartment also matched bullets from the scene, according to investigators referencing forensic examination.\n\nIndianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett discussed making Broad Ripple a \"gun free zone\" after the shootings.\n\n\"We see it far too often in our community where these senseless acts turn into senseless violence, and I think a lot of people in our community are tired of seeing these types of incidents occur,\" Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears said."

        "title": "Ripple CTO urges AMM integration into XRP Ledger - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ripple chief technology officer David Schwartz advocates for integrating an automated market maker (AMM) feature with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to enable the creation of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the XRPL.\n\nSchwartz described AMMs as a fascinating aspect of decentralized finance in a post on social media. However, implementing this feature should only proceed with the consensus of the XRPL community, he explained.\n\nThe XRPL operates as a decentralized blockchain network, facilitating efficient and secure transactions for the XRP cryptocurrency.\n\nUnlike conventional systems, XRPL employs the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA) for consensus, ensuring quick transaction processing and scalability.\n\nIt provides a practical foundation for developing decentralized applications (dApps), while the AMM is a decentralized exchange solution that relies on a mathematical formula to establish asset prices. This formula considers the supply and demand of the assets involved, adjusting prices accordingly.\n\nYou might also like: SEC and Ripple seek extension for filing unredacted cross-motions\n\nAMMs are the weird defi trick everyone's talking about. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 6, 2023\n\nWhen asked about the timeline for AMMs becoming active on XRPL after governance voting by a community member, Schwartz responded that if the majority supports the amendment, the changes could be implemented in as little as two weeks.\n\nSchwartz highlighted that, as far as he knows, no validators currently support the majority vote. The AMM feature was introduced with the release of Ripple version 1.12.0, which also introduced the potential clawback feature.\n\nThe team says that incorporating an AMM doesn\u2019t just involve adding a new trading engine; it will also facilitate integration with the XRPL decentralized exchange.\n\nIn general though, validators shouldn't vote YES individually. The community should make a decision and then validators should nearly all vote YES when they believe the community is on board and enough nodes support the change.\n\n\n\nThe amendment voting process is intended to\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 6, 2023\n\nDespite the feature\u2019s importance, Schwartz cautioned validators against voting independently for these changes. He stressed the need for the community to reach a consensus first. Validators should vote \u2018YES,\u2019 overwhelmingly when they observe that the community agrees and sufficient nodes endorse the adjustment.\n\nIn April, Schwartz also urged caution for those considering investing in XRP through an AMM. He outlined three key reasons for this caution.\n\nFirstly, Schwartz highlighted the exposure to other digital assets within the AMM, explaining that price fluctuations of one asset can impact the value of all other assets in the pool, including XRP.\n\nWhile acknowledging the usefulness of AMMs for trading, Schwartz emphasized the need for investors to thoroughly research and understand the potential risks before choosing to hold XRP within an AMM.\n\nAdditionally, he pointed out the limited potential for significant gains as another risk. Despite AMMs providing liquidity for XRP and other tokens, there\u2019s no guarantee of substantial price gains for XRP.\n\nProbably between 1/3 and 1/4. There are really only three reasons not hold your XRP in an AMM:\n\n1) There could be an implementation bug in the AMM code that causes you to lose money. A low risk, but non-zero. \u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 25, 2023\n\nRipple scores another victory over an SEC\n\nIn related news, judge Analisa Torres has denied the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) motion to appeal its loss against Ripple Labs.\n\nThe SEC sought to appeal the partial ruling in Ripple\u2019s favor, declaring that retail XRP token sales didn\u2019t meet the legal definition of a security.\n\nHowever, Judge Torres rejected the SEC\u2019s motion, stating they failed to prove controlling legal questions or substantial differences of opinion. A trial date is set for April 23, 2024. Ripple execs and the Gary Gensler-led SEC will meet in person for at least an hour to discuss a settlement before the final pretrial conference.\n\nJudge Torres had found the SEC\u2019s appeal wouldn\u2019t significantly expedite the case\u2019s resolution. This ruling should mark a crucial win for Ripple, reaffirming the validity of the previous ruling.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/filanlaw/status/1709343608338309383?s=46&t=TgjDKnTfjRbndDwIp3uJlA"

        "title": "COVID-19's ripple effect: South African TB diagnostics take a hit - News-Medical.Net",
        "content": "In a recent study published in Scientific Reports, researchers evaluate the influence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics at primary health clinics (PHCs) in the eThekwini district of South Africa.\n\nDuring the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak quickly disrupted the provision and utilization of health facilities across the globe. The inadequacy of effective treatments prompted the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The repurposing of human resources and health facilities to mitigate COVID-19 had devastating impacts on the management of other diseases, especially TB.\n\nStudy: Impact of COVID-19 on TB diagnostic services at primary healthcare clinics in eThekwini district, South Africa. Image Credit: Ground Picture / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbout the study\n\nIn the present study, researchers investigate the magnitude of COVID-19-related disruption of TB diagnostic services at PHCs in South Africa.\n\nThe District Health Information System (DHIS) monthly aggregated data were used to perform an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to assess changes in the investigation and verification of TB throughout COVID-19. These data were classified into different time periods, including the pre-pandemic period between January 2018 and February 2020, followed by April 2020, which was the initial COVID-19-related lockdown period, as well as sequential COVID-19 waves.\n\nClinics with missing data and outlier values were excluded from the analysis. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression modeling was performed in addition to segmented-type linear regression modeling, the latter of which was used to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on TB investigations and verifications during the lockdown and subsequent COVID-19 waves.\n\nThe first exposure period reflected the level five lockdown in April 2020, followed by the second exposure period during the first COVID-19 wave peak in July 2020. The third exposure period reflected the second COVID-19 wave peak in January 2021, whereas the fourth exposure period denoted the third COVID-19 wave peak in July 2021. The fifth exposure period was the peak of the fourth COVID-19 wave in December 2021.\n\nStudy findings\n\nA total of 94 and 76 PHCs were included in the study to analyze tuberculosis investigations and confirmed cases, respectively. The mean monthly counts of TB investigations and confirmed cases at the PHCs were 9,965 and 754, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak significantly affected both tuberculosis indicators; however, the effects were heterogeneous throughout the pandemic.\n\nThe lockdown period resulted in a 45% reduction in diagnostic investigations and a 40% reduction in confirmed cases of TB. Before the pandemic, TB investigations at PHCs were increasing marginally by 23 tests each month from the baseline count of 8,860 tests. However, during the initial level five lockdown period, there was a reduction of 4,165 investigations.\n\nA significant recovery was observed in both indicators after the initial COVID-19 wave. TB investigations sustained smaller reductions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic; however, they rebounded and exceeded pre-pandemic levels towards the end of the study period. TB diagnostic services at PHCs were considerably affected by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, with TB case confirmations most adversely affected throughout COVID-19.\n\nTB investigations during the first COVID-19 wave in July of 2020 increased by 16% compared to during the level five lockdown. However, after the initial COVID-19 wave, TB investigations increased by 712 monthly.\n\nThe second COVID-19 wave was associated with a 23% decrease in January 2021, with these reductions persisting month-by-month. During the third COVID-19 wave, dominated by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, TB investigations were associated with non-significant reductions.\n\nBy December 2021, the fourth COVID-19 wave showed a 33% reduction in TB investigations. Although monthly trends slightly reduced following the fourth peak, graphical representations indicated more investigations for TB were conducted during this period as compared to before the start of the pandemic.\n\nMonth-wise, TB case confirmations were stable pre-pandemic and slightly deviated from the count of 803 at study initiation. During the lockdown in April 2020, TB confirmations were significantly reduced by 334, a 40% reduction that continued each month by seven cases after level five lockdown.\n\nDuring the first wave of COVID-19 cases, TB confirmations increased marginally by 7%; however, after the lockdown, TB confirmations increased by 47. During the second COVID-19 wave, TB confirmations reduced by 12% and remained consistent at these lower levels in the following months.\n\nAt the peak of the third COVID-19 wave, TB confirmations decreased by 29% but increased by an average of 46 cases monthly following the peak. By the fourth COVID-19 wave, TB confirmations reduced by 26%.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe study findings highlight the impact of COVID-19 on TB diagnostics in PHCs in South Africa. Further research is needed to determine the reasons for the persistent reductions in TB detection and inform the development of sustainable diagnostic systems that can withstand future pandemics."
