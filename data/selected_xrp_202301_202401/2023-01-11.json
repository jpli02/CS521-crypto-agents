        "content": "South Korean payments company and RippleNet user SentBe announced the launch of its international money-transfer services in the United States. According to the press release, users of the company's services, which primarily represent the working class and migrant workforce, will now be able to send money transfers from the new country to more than 50 other countries where SentBe already operates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, SentBe has been a Ripple partner since 2020. As co-founder Jay Lee Young said at the time, the standardized process of integrating Ripple technologies, namely RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), makes connecting with partners in the region easier and provides fast, convenient and cheap money transfers.\n\nAs was reported by U.Today in December, SentBe joined forces with another RippleNet user, Currencycloud, in what appeared to be the latest move to expand into the North American and European markets.\n\nPartnership is key\n\nRipple's presence in Asia, and particularly in Southeast Asia, is quite large. If you look at the news of the achievements of Ripple and its partners over the past few months, you can easily sketch a map of the region in your head.\n\nBetween Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Japan and South Korea, Ripple's partner network covers almost every major country in Asia. This explains the fact that XRP trading takes a large chunk of the total volume on many of the region's crypto exchanges."

        "title": "The ax has fallen at Goldman Sachs as layoffs ripple through the storied firm - Fortune",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs, one of the most powerful Wall Street firms, started informing employees on Wednesday if they would keep their jobs, Fortune has learned.\n\nGoldman is expected to slash up to 3,200 positions globally, down from the prior expectation of up to 4,000. Due to time zone differences, the layoffs began earlier in Asia, while employees in New York began learning their fate during the work day Wednesday. The mood at Goldman was dour, one person familiar with the situation said. \u201cRemember many [Goldman employees] have never been through a downsizing,\u201d the person said.\n\nOutside Goldman\u2019s headquarters at 200 West Street in Manhattan on Wednesday, groups of grim-faced employees exiting the building refused to answer questions. When asked by Fortune how the day went, several Goldman staffers said, \u201cFine\u201d and rushed away. Others ignored the question and moved on.\n\nThe 154-year-old firm employs about 49,000 people. The layoffs are anticipated to impact divisions across Goldman, including the firm\u2019s vaunted investment banking unit, which was expected to see the most cuts. Around one-third of those impacted by the layoffs will come from Goldman\u2019s investment banking and global markets division, Reuters reported.\n\nThe layoffs started shortly after 8 a.m. Wednesday, the New York Post reported. Goldman deactivated employee I.D.s and escorted workers out of the firm\u2019s Manhattan headquarters that was ringed by security guards, the story said.\n\nGoldman is also expected to cut its annual bonus pool by 40% to 50%, while another 5% to 10% of staffers aren\u2019t getting bonuses, Fortune has reported. The job cuts will be followed by a broader spending review covering corporate travel and expenses, according to the Financial Times.\n\nGoldman declined to comment.\n\nThe reductions are a reaction to the decrease in investment banking revenue at Goldman. In 2021, mergers and initial public offerings posted their best year ever but a broad market contraction (along with recession fears, the war in Ukraine, and inflation) caused M&A and IPOs to slow down significantly last year. In the third quarter, Goldman reported $11.98 billion in revenue. More than half of that came from global markets, which includes trading and sales. Investment banking revenue dropped 57% in Q3 to $1.58 billion. The unit generated just 13% of Goldman\u2019s third quarter revenue last year, down from 27% in 2021.\n\nThe layoffs come just months after Goldman announced its latest reorganization. In October, the bank said it would consolidate its businesses into three units. As Fortune reported, Goldman combined its asset and wealth management units into one segment, and put investment banking and global markets, along with trading, into a second segment. A third unit, called Platform Solutions, consolidated fintech platforms from across Goldman including transaction banking, consumer partnerships (mainly credit cards with Apple and General Motors), and specialty lender GreenSky. Shares of Goldman are down about 14% from their 52-week high. The stock on Wednesday closed up nearly 2% at $364.48."

        "title": "FAA ground stop, severe weather threat may have lasting ripple effect on flight delays across US - Fox Weather",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Normal flight operations are starting to resume hours after the Federal Aviation Administration announced a major system outage that led to a nationwide ground stop for thousands of flights, and with severe weather threatening parts of the South on Thursday, travelers could be in for a chaotic couple of days when it comes to air travel.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, the FAA said there was an outage with the NOTAM (Notice to Air Missions) system, which is an important notice that contains essential information to personnel connected to flight operations.\n\nThe FAA spent hours working to repair the system and ordered the ground stop while those repairs were ongoing.\n\nIt was the first nationwide ground stop ordered by the FAA since the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said he had been in contact with the FAA about the major system outage while they were working \"swiftly and safely\" so air traffic could resume normal operations.\n\nJust before 9 a.m. EST, Buttigieg said the system had been fully restored, and the previous nationwide ground stop was to be lifted effective immediately.\n\n\"I have directed an after-action process to determine root causes and recommended next steps,\" he said in a tweet.\n\nEarlier Wednesday morning, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also released a statement and said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the ongoing situation with the FAA and said there was no evidence so far that this was the result of a cyberattack.\n\nHERE'S WHAT CAUSES TURBULENCE AND WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID OF IT\n\nMore than 8,100 flights were delayed during the outage, and the FAA said that all flights already in the air were cleared to continue their journeys and land safely.\n\nThis is because pilots check the NOTAM system before taking off to learn about any potential issues, like closed runways, equipment outages and other potential hazards.\n\nSouthwest Airlines said its flight operations were impacted by the nationwide ground stop on Wednesday and warned passengers that flight disruptions would continue.\n\nAs a result, Southwest Airlines said any of its passengers traveling on Wednesday would be able to change their flight for travel within 14 days of the original travel date without having to pay additional charges.\n\nCheck the Southwest Airlines website for more information.\n\nUnited Air Lines and Delta Airlines have also announced they will waive fees for passengers changing flights on Wednesday.\n\nAnyone scheduled to travel on Wednesday should call their airline directly before heading to the airport to ensure flights have not been delayed or canceled.\n\nFlight delays could have ripple effect across US\n\nAs normal flight operations slowly start to get back to normal, these delays will likely have a ripple effect across the country \u2013 even if thousands of other flights weren't affected.\n\nThis is because of where airplanes were when the ground stop was issued.\n\nSuppose a flight was delayed early Wednesday in New York, for example, and that flight was headed to Los Angeles. In that case, the scheduled flight from Los Angeles to another airport could be affected because of the aircraft's late arrival.\n\nAviation experts say the combination of the potential disruptions increases the likelihood that a plane's crew will time out because of strict FAA rules that limit the hours pilots and flight attendants can work without a break.\n\n\"Without a deep bench of pilots to call up from reserve, flights will experience long delays or cancellations,\" said Kathleen Bangs, a former commercial airline pilot and current FlightAware spokeswoman.\n\nHOW THUNDERSTORMS HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY CAN WREAK HAVOC ON AIR TRAVEL\n\nThis could also become an issue for anyone traveling in areas Wednesday to try and beat the severe weather threat expected Thursday in parts of the Southeast, including the Atlanta area.\n\nThe FOX Forecast Center is tracking a potent storm that is expected to bring the threat of severe thunderstorms to the Southeast.\n\nThere is a risk of severe thunderstorms Thursday afternoon and evening across Alabama and Georgia, including the Atlanta metro.\n\nDamaging wind gusts and brief tornadoes are possible.\n\nATLANTA, SOUTHEAST FACE LATE-WEEK SEVERE WEATHER THREAT; NORTHEAST EXPECTED TO SEE HEAVY RAIN, SOME SNOW\n\nGround stop in US affects international air travel\n\nFOX Business correspondent Edward Lawrence was in Mexico City Wednesday morning waiting for a flight to the U.S. when the issue began.\n\n\"We had actually partially boarded our flight and was sitting in the chair, and we were told we had to get off the flight because all flights going into the United States have been grounded because of the issues that the FAA is having,\" Lawrence told FOX Weather meteorologist Jason Frazer on Wednesday.\n\nLawrence said airport passengers had been patiently waiting for information about upcoming flights.\n\n\"It's very early in the morning, so folks are just sitting down and waiting,\" he said. \"We had a discussion with the pilot as we were getting off the plane, and he was saying this was the first time he has seen this kind of stoppage for this particular system.\""

        "title": "The Powerful Ripple Effect of Playful Learning - MacArthur Foundation",
        "content": "Five years ago, a plan to help children cope with the distress of the Syrian war received $100 million. Today, the program has reached millions of children and parents across the Middle East and North Africa with a new Sesame Street show, healthy development, and early learning toward a resilient and thriving future.\n\nIn June, Samera Zaidi, Director of International Research and Evaluation at Sesame Workshop, was meeting with families to gather feedback about characters and storylines planned for Ahlan Simsim, the Arabic-language version of Sesame Street for children in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). A new character, Ameera, is a girl who uses a wheelchair and crutches to navigate the world.\n\nAmeera resonated with one mother who, like many families at the gathering, was living in temporary housing in Lebanon after she fled the Syrian conflict. She approached the researcher and told of her young son who had lost part of his arm during the conflict.\n\n\u201cIt meant so much to this mom to have her son see this representational character be part of the story and feel that others are like him,\u201d recalled Ren\u00e9 Celaya, Vice President for Humanitarian Programs at Sesame Workshop and Managing Director of the Ahlan Simsim project. \u201cIt was a tiny moment but some of these tiny moments capture the essence and intent of our work.\u201d\n\nA behind-the-scenes look into the creation of Ahlan Simsim, an Arabic-language version of Sesame Street created for children across the Middle East.\n\nFive years ago, Ahlan Simsim, \u201cWelcome Sesame\u201d in Arabic, was selected from nearly 2,000 proposals to receive $100 million in MacArthur's first 100&Change competition for a $100 million grant to fund a single proposal that promises real and measurable progress in solving a critical problem of our time.\n\nAhlan Simsim is a collaboration between the popular children\u2019s educational media organization Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee (IRC), an international humanitarian organization. The award-winning project for 100&Change called for promoting critical early childhood development (ECD), including vital social-emotional learning, for children affected by conflict in Syria and the surrounding region.\n\nRecognizing the potential of combining mass media and targeted direct services, the organizations teamed up to leverage their strengths. Sesame Workshop would create a new show, Ahlan Simsim, featuring familiar-looking, shaggy, colorful Sesame Muppets. IRC would deliver ECD programs and services for children and caregivers, integrating and leveraging Sesame Workshop\u2019s educational content and characters. Eventually, these programs would be scaled up in collaboration with national governments and local partners for long-term, sustained impact.\n\nFive years later, Ahlan Simsim is a complex network of individuals, families, community organizations, schools, and national ministries of education, health, and social development across Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and elsewhere around the world. The program\u2019s services are embedded in national systems, and the show has aired for six seasons, broadcast across the MENA, and is available on YouTube and other platforms. Ahlan Simsim also has a comprehensive research component.\n\nThe work supports early learning from letters and numbers to managing emotions associated with the impacts of disruptive events such as large-scale conflicts and crises.\n\n\"All of it\u2014the mass media offerings, targeted direct services, and extensive research\u2014has made Ahlan Simsim the largest ECD intervention in the history of humanitarian response.\"\n\nOver 23 million children in 22 countries across the region watch Ahlan Simsim on televisions and mobile devices. In addition, critical Ahlan Simsim ECD services\u2014including playful learning and nurturing care programs that IRC and partners provide\u2014have reached a million children and caregivers via remote delivery and in centers, classrooms, and clinics in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.\n\nThe research component is a partnership between New York University\u2019s Global TIES for Children and Ahlan Simsim that aims to double the existing evidence on what ECD programs are most effective in crisis settings. The findings, expected at the end of 2022 and mid-2023, will be shared with the wider humanitarian and development communities, key partners, and other stakeholders.\n\nThe sharing of learnings is a key part of Ahlan Simsim's commitment to contributing meaningful learning to the field and plans to provide scalable models that can be replicated and used wherever and whenever children and families are affected by conflict or crisis.\n\nAll of it\u2014the mass media offerings, targeted direct services, and extensive research\u2014has made Ahlan Simsim the largest ECD intervention in the history of humanitarian response.\n\nOpportunities, Challenges, and Changes\n\nWhen the Foundation\u2019s decision was announced in December 2017, Sesame Workshop tweeted that it was \u201cthrilled and honored\u201d to have received the grant. IRC President and CEO David Miliband told the Chicago Tribune the support \u201cwill create a model for investment in early childhood services around the world.\u201d\n\nAs exciting as the award was, it produced a wide array of possibilities and substantial challenges.\n\nFor one, a pilot project created about a year before the announcement of the 100&Change challenge was administering support to Syrian families in Jordan. After Sesame Workshop and IRC received the grant, the collaborative expanded that work\u2014partnering with national ministries of education, health, and social development\u2014to begin serving families affected by displacement and crisis in Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria.\n\nOther formal and informal collaborations of all sizes also have been established, creating effective networks and addressing children\u2019s development needs in their important early years.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is this amazing combination of partners within countries connecting and learning across the program region,\u201d Celaya said. \u201cAnd the show is reaching all households that can watch in the wider Middle East and North Africa. Those dimensions are really fascinating.\u201d\n\nOther unforeseen benefits have emerged from connections made at all levels\u2014from families and small communities to large nongovernmental organizations and governments.\n\n\u201cThe grant has given us the opportunity to find and work with amazing people within other organizations,\u201d Celaya said. \u201cIt also has allowed us to bring amazing people into the work. That has been a wonderful opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the $100 million was the first time the Sesame Workshop-IRC partnership experienced long-term, trusting, and flexible financing, said Marianne Stone, IRC Regional Project Director for Ahlan Simsim.\n\n\"What we\u2019re seeing is this amazing combination of partners within countries connecting and learning across the program region.\"\n\n\u201cNow I say to donors very openly, if you want to see actual transformative impact, donors across the board need to rethink their position on agility and flexibility,\u201d Stone said, adding that funders need to reconsider existing models to create a long-term, flexible structure for all grantees, not only Ahlan Simsim.\n\nAlso fascinating, Celaya said, are the organizational challenges the grant has presented.\n\nSesame Workshop and IRC, which traditionally have structured projects around individual countries and regions within countries, had to make major adaptations internally and with partners to accommodate Ahlan Simsim\u2019s multi-country approach.\n\nThey also had to weave the work of the sizable, multi-year grant into ongoing initiatives at both organizations.\n\n\u201cIt challenged a lot of organizational assumptions,\u201d Celaya said, \u201cand it challenged a lot of the external relations implications with partners and governments.\u201d\n\nManaging those relations was \u201ca twist\u201d that has succeeded largely through building on relationships both organizations already had in place, he said.\n\nChildren participate in an Ahlan Simsim educational game at a community-based organization in Al-Karak, Jordan. Photo by Sarah Nasser/Sesame Workshop\n\nNew Donors Responding\n\nThen there\u2019s the $100 million question, which surfaces from time-to-time and goes something like this: Ahlan Simsim received $100 million. It does not need more money, right?\n\nCelaya acknowledged that it is a fair question that at times has been difficult to explain inside the organizations and externally.\n\nHe noted that Ahlan Simsim covers four countries, delivers its work on multiple levels with multiple organizations and partners, produces several seasons of the show, and includes a comprehensive research element.\n\nBeyond that, COVID-19 made the work much more challenging in 2020 and 2021, prompting the Sesame-IRC partnership to extend the original five-year length of the grant to six years.\n\nEffectively running an initiative of that scope, depth, and complexity has required a sizable investment, Celaya said, and will require more.\n\n\u201cIt seems like a lot of money, and it is,\u201d he said. \u201cOne hundred million is enough to achieve a lot of wonderful things. But it is allocated to achieving certain goals with respective budgets.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Celaya said, according to the UN, over six million children in the region are still in need and 27 percent of those young people are at risk of poor development. Both organizations have been proactive in communicating what has been achieved with funding and what\u2019s possible with more, he said.\n\n\u201cWe want to reach more children within these countries and explore possibilities to reach out to children in other countries in the Middle East and North Africa.\u201d\n\nDonors have responded. About 14 have joined the work, contributing more than $200 million in funding beyond the $100 million from 100&Change, Celaya added.\n\n\u2018Ripple Effects\u2019\n\nLooking to the future, Celaya and Stone said they plan to continue developing Ahlan Simsim content and program services that might be tailored to specific regions and adding cognitive skills to the social-emotional learning at the heart of the initiative.\n\nThey know that Ahlan Simsim\u2019s legacy is embedding itself, as the partnership prepares to launch a seventh season of the show in the spring, and government partnerships are integrating the program\u2019s services into national systems. Previous episodes of Ahlan Simsim will continue to be available on YouTube. Also, program content\u2014including books, curricula, lessons, and activity materials\u2014will be publicly accessible.\n\n\"We hope that these are the ripple effects that will last beyond the life of the project.\"\n\nParents, caregivers, teachers, small organizations, and large institutions have embraced Ahlan Simsim\u2019s approaches to make these especially vulnerable children more resilient. Those children will carry those skills with them for the rest of their lives and pass them on to others.\n\n\u201cWe hope that these are the ripple effects that will last beyond the life of the project,\u201d Stone said.\n\nCelaya and Stone continue collecting small, meaningful stories that demonstrate the power of Ahlan Simsim\u2019s work.\n\nMcArthur President John Palfrey visits with Ahlan Simsim participants in Al-Karak, Jordan. Photo by Sarah Nasser/Sesame Workshop.\n\nLike the moment that arose in May during a visit from MacArthur Foundation representatives to Jordan. They asked families gathered for a meeting to describe what Ahlan Simsim meant to them.\n\nA mother shared how her family watched an episode of the show at home then went to a community-based organization where her children received ECD programming using Ahlan Simsim. The children heard the same themes and saw the same characters they had watched on the show earlier.\n\nThe continuity of Ahlan Simsim messaging through both those experiences, the mother said, brought joy to her children and sparked an interest in learning.\n\n\u201cHearing how the knowledge sets of these two organizations came together for a family in very concrete, simple terms,\u201d Celaya said, \u201cthat was really a special moment for me.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared on the Lever for Change blog.\n\nView the Sesame Workshop and International Rescue Committee's awardee profile \u203a"
