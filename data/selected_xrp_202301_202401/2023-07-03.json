        "title": "ByteDance Is Working On \"Ripple,\" an AI-Powered Music Creation App - HYPEBEAST",
        "content": "TikTok parent company ByteDance has another app in the works, this one, geared towards making music with the assistance of AI. The company shared that it has engineered its own music creation app called Ripple.\n\nCurrently being tested in an invite-only closed beta, Ripple allows users to create and edit tracks in a manner similar to digital audio workstations (DAWs). While DAWs require some prior knowledge, or at least a bit of experimentation, to get the hang of them, Ripple is billed as a simpler, streamlined way to create original songs.\n\nA user can simply hum a melody into a phone mic and Ripple will convert it into a music, contributing its own AI-generated instrumentals, such as drums, guitar and bass. The length of a song will match the exact amount of time that a user hums, so if they want a full-length track, they\u2019ll have to be ready to hum for a few minutes.\n\nRipple is also only capable of generating instrumentals, leaving vocals up to the creator. Still, it may be a convenient way for creators who don\u2019t know how to play instruments to make their own music.\n\nRipple\u2019s \u201cvirtual recording studio\u201d additionally lets users cut and move around audio files to create their ideal song.\n\nByteDance says that the music Ripple was trained on is either its property or licensed to them for that purpose. The app will also be connected to TikTok, so that a user can import a track to use as background music.\n\nIn other tech news, \u200b\u200bCowboy\u2019s new Cruiser e-bike keeps comfort at the forefront."

        "content": "XRP is printing a stagnant price performance as a major bank reportedly reevaluates its partnership with a company Ripple purchased earlier this year for $250 million.\n\nAccording to a new report by Bloomberg, anonymous sources familiar with the matter say that financial services titan Citigroup is reconsidering its partnership with Swiss fintech company Metaco.\n\nIt has not been made clear yet if the bank\u2019s review of Metaco is associated with Ripple Labs acquiring it, according to the report.\n\nRipple originally purchased Metaco in May, at the time citing research that suggested that blue-chip investors plan to heavily incorporate crypto custody services into their business models within the next three years.\n\nAs stated by Ripple,\n\n\u201cCustody is a key facet of the infrastructure required for enterprise crypto services, and recent research conducted by Ripple shows that most global finance leaders at financial institutions and enterprises have plans to use crypto custody solutions in their business within the next three years \u2013 primarily through a third-party provider.\u201d\n\nMetaco, which offers tokenization services to create digital representations of real-life assets on blockchains, would ideally let Ripple\u2019s institutional clients to custody, issue and settle tokenized assets.\n\nAt time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.48, a fractional decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nRipple Labs Inc has released a total number of one billion XRP coins from escrow in a wave of three transactions. According to data insights from Whale Alerts, the first transaction occurred at 12:00 a.m. (UTC), with a total of 300 million XRP tokens unlocked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second transaction featured the release of 200 million XRP, while the last transaction saw the firm unlock a total of 500 million XRP tokens from its escrow accounts. The XRP release from escrow is a strategic business move designed to help cushion the liquidity of the cryptocurrency in circulation.\n\nThe locking of XRP in escrow accounts dates back to 2017 with a defined approach to release the token gradually every month in a bid to prevent devaluing the digital currency. In line with the strategy, a total of one billion tokens were designed to be released every month over a 55-month period. Based on the projected timeline, the last tranche is set to be released by December 2023.\n\nThe deep ties between Ripple Labs and the XRP coin remains a major basis of contention in the company's lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEscrow impact on XRP price\n\nThe recent escrow release appears to be taking a minimal toll on the price of XRP. At the time of writing, the digital currency is changing hands at a price of $0.4819, down by 0.12% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis price slip comes at a time when many top digital currencies are experiencing a broad price recovery across the board. With the current outlook, XRP may ride on the ongoing bullish momentum in the market and reverse its course in the near term.\n\nWhile many may see the XRP release as a problem, it can actually serve as an avenue to stack up more of the asset in the near term."

        "title": "Ripple v. SEC case update as of July 3, 2023 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency industry is still eagerly awaiting the conclusion of the lawsuit that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed against Ripple, a pro-XRP legal expert has offered more arguments that support the blockchain firm\u2019s side of the legal battle.\n\nIndeed, lawyer Bill Morgan joined a discussion that included a well-known XRP community member Mr. Huber and former SEC enforcement lawyer Marc Fagel, in which the former asked why the regulator filed no injunction at all \u201cif Ripple did anything nefarious or even illegal besides \u2018selling unregistered securities\u2019\u201d in a tweet on July 2.\n\nAs he further inquired:\n\n\u201cWhat is the point of protecting investors if Ripple can continue to pursue what the SEC considers to be clearly illegal and damaging activities to investors for years after the lawsuit is filed? Shouldn\u2019t the SEC have at least tried to file for this for the \u201cprotection\u201d of investors?\u201d\n\nIn response, Morgan said that the reason for this was that \u201csince May 2020, Ripple has only engaged in [on-demand liquidity (ODL)] sales, and the SEC would risk a finding on a [temporary restraining order (TRO)]/preliminary injunction motion that ODL sales are not investment contracts as it would weaken its argument that the token itself is a security.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, he continued:\n\n\u201cThe SEC would need to show how there is an investment contract when ODL customers who don\u2019t invest in the token and don\u2019t expect profits & transacts the XRP within seconds for fast cheap cross border PAYMENTS, not investments.\u201d\n\nODL versus programmatic sales\n\nEarlier, Finbold reported on Morgan shedding his perspective on some rarely raised issues in the community. These included the difference between programmatic sales or open market exchange trades of XRP and sales through Ripple\u2019s ODL system that allows customers to move money across borders instantly and at a low cost, without banking intermediaries.\n\nAs he said:\n\n\u201cMy theory is Ripple XRP sales to ODL customers cannot be investment contracts because there is no investment or investment intent by ODL customers and no expectation of profits by ODL customers who hold XRP for a very short time and use it akin to consumption.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Morgan also pointed out the SEC\u2019s practices that he said were \u201cno way to achieve clarity,\u201d stating the example of Dash (DASH), which launched in 2014, only for the regulator to suddenly decide it is a security nine years later, \u201cafter there was no indication that [Proof-of-Work (PoW)] tokens which are mined were securities.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the XRP token that is at the center of the lawsuit was, at the time of publication, changing hands at the price of $0.4815. This indicates a decrease of 0.28% in the last 24 hours, as well as a drop of 0.86% across the previous seven days and a more significant 8.77% on its monthly chart, as per data on July 3."

We had two ladies killed within 24 hours that bothered us. I've got 7 homicides around my house in the last year and a half where I sit on my porch. I'm concerned,\" said Elder Olgen Williams.\n\nElder Olgen Williams is a long-time advocate for Haughville.\n\nHe along with business owners and community members are asking the city to pour more resources into the west side to help fight gun violence.\n\n\"When crime happens in our neighborhood, it's treated as though it is expected. oh, we expect that, you know, the crime that happens in this neighborhood, because it's a dangerous place. That is something that we don't want to stand for or tolerate,\" said Aaron Williams.\n\nThey want a heavier police presence from the southwest district, more cameras, lighting towers and better communication with IMPD, the mayors office, and the department of public works.\n\n\"We're not coming against the city police department, we want to work with the police department. We want the city to get behind the west district as they do north district,\" said Robert Laster.\n\nThe call for action follows the changes made in Broad Ripple.\n\nThe same night Pierce was killed, four people were shot in the village. Three died.\n\nThe city, Broad Ripple Village Association and IMPD are taking steps to keep trouble out of the entertainment zone which includes the lighting towers, cameras, and more.\n\nRELATED | Hogsett announces new restrictions in Broad Ripple to reduce crime, gun violence (wrtv.com)\n\nRobert Laster says although Broad Ripple is a popular spot at night and on the weekends and Haughville isn't, their community deserves more.\n\n\"A life is a life and we want to get the same acknowledgment, the same support, the same resources to help us right here in Haughville,\" said Laster.\n\nRobin Staten-Lanier knows what's it like to lose a loved one to gun violence.\n\n\"My father was murdered in a double homicide in the summer of 1998,\" said Staten-Lanier.\n\nShe says his case hasn't been solved.\n\n\"And so with that experience, I bring a different expectation and response that I'm hoping to receive from the city of Indianapolis,\" she said.\n\n\"Help the west side with resources we need,\" said Williams.\n\nIndianapolis Metropolitan Police Department made the following statement in response to the request:\n\nIMPD has and will continue to patrol and protect every neighborhood in the city of Indianapolis. At the same time, the IMPD will stay adaptable to where and when violence occurs. Decisions on the deployment of resources are based on several factors including the recent amount of criminal activity in a specific area, the number of resources already in the area, information on events or group gatherings, and threat assessments.\n\nSpecifically, in the Haughville neighborhood, IMPD Southwest District officers have adjusted based on conversations with residents. That includes increased visibility with proactive patrols, which involves foot patrols and vehicle patrols at night with marker lights activated. Recently, IMPD deployed a trailer camera to Haughville to monitor a block party and the event went off without a hitch. IMPD has also invested in other technology and resources in the neighborhood after it was requested by residents and community members.\n\nIMPD welcomes the opportunity to have continued conversations with Haughville residents and business owners.\n\nThe mayor's office said, \"Multiple senior officials including the mayor have been in touch with Mr. Williams.\"\n\n"
