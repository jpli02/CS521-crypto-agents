        "content": "Ripple XRP SEC Case: Although attorney John Deaton believes there is a high chance of the XRP SEC case going to a jury trial, he said there was also a likelihood of XRP winning the lawsuit with a fine. Currently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple are awaiting the summary judgement by the court. The case is primarily contested on the SEC\u2019s argument that XRP is sold in the form of unregistered securities. The case dates back to December 2020, when Ripple was accused of raising over $1.3 billion illegally.\n\nAlso Read: U.S. SEC\u2019s New Rule To Affect Coinbase, Other Crypto Exchanges?\n\nadvertisement\n\nRipple\u2019s Chances\n\nThe XRP lawyer believes the SEC\u2019s stands a minute chance owing to proving that Ripple offered XRP as an unregistered security between 2013 and 2017. However, the argument stands true subject to correction whether Ripple did not sell XRP as a security beyond that period. Deaton made the comments in response to claims that Ripple sold XRP to users of on-demand liquidity for immediate cross border payments and not as a security-like instrument. This is different from the SEC\u2019s view that the assets were always sold as unregistered securities.\n\n\u201cI believe the only victory for SEC is that Ripple offered XRP as unregistered security between 2013-2017.\u201d\n\nHence, if this argument holds true in the court, Ripple could get away with just a fine and not any injunction or disgorgement, Deaton says. However, he thinks \u201cchances of a jury trial are higher than most people believe.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Chainlink (LINK) To Pivot The AI Token Way?: Developers Hint\n\nMeanwhile, XRP price stands at $0.400253, up 5.58% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGape price tracker."

        "content": "The bumpy texture of these rocks is the clearest evidence yet from Mount Sharp of an ancient Martian lake. Billions of years ago, wind playing across the surface of a shallow lake disturbed the lake-bottom sediments, which eventually became these rocks.\n\nNASA's Curiosity Mars rover has photographed rocks imprinted with tiny ripples from an ancient lake. And these tiny ripples are making waves on Earth, as they are the clearest evidence yet that water once existed on the Red Planet.\n\nThe ripple marks were discovered frozen in Martian rock on the slopes of Mount Sharp. Though Curiosity has traversed many rock deposits laid down in ancient lakes, scientists had not seen such vivid marks in the rocks before.\n\n\"This is the best evidence of water and waves that we've seen in the entire mission,\" Ashwin Vasavada , Curiosity\u2019s project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said in a statement . \"We climbed through thousands of feet of lake deposits and never saw evidence like this \u2013 and now we found it in a place we expected to be dry.\"\n\nSince last fall, the rover has been exploring a region of what scientists call \"sulfate-bearing\" rock. Scientists believe this salt-rich area was deposited when an ancient lake was nearly dry. But the ripples were created on the bottom of a shallow lake as winds created waves on the lake\u2019s surface, disturbing the sediments below.\n\nThe ripple marks are about 0.5 mile (0.8 kilometer) up Mount Sharp, a mountain made up of a layer cake of rock that records Martian history. The 3-mile-tall (5 km) mountain was once dotted with lakes and streams, making it an intriguing area to search for signs of ancient Martian life, according to the NASA statement.\n\nA portion of a panorama taken by the Mars Curiosity rover of the \"Marker Band\" section of Mount Sharp. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSS)\n\nCuriosity captured a 360-degree panorama of a layer of rock known as the \"Marker Band\" on the slope of the mountain on Dec. 16, 2022. The rover also attempted to drill into the rocks of this layer, near the rippled features, but the rocks were too hard. Curiosity's drivers plan to look for softer rock in the layer for additional drilling attempts.\n\nThe presence of ripples in a supposedly dry area suggests that Mars did not go from wet to dry in a simple, linear manner, the Curiosity researchers said. Near the rippled rocks, researchers also saw rock layers with regular spacing and thickness. These types of layers often occur on Earth during patterns of periodic change.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The valley appears to hold debris from wet landslides and a channel that may have been formed by a river."

        "content": "Ripple CTO David Schwartz predicted earlier this year that the second wave of tokenized assets would shift to utility-based NFTs. In fact, every Ripple executive that weighed in on 2023 crypto trends predicted that 2023 will be the year of real-world utility.\n\nIt appears as though those digital token predictions are already coming true. One of the top trends in Web3 that has emerged over the past year is the bridging of physical products, services, and experiences with the digital world\u2014also known as \u2018phygital NFTs\u2019. From bringing IRL concerts to the metaverse; to digital token gating with utility; brands, musicians and creators can offer exclusive products and content to their followers\u2014powered by blockchain technology. It\u2019s no surprise some of the biggest household names in the fashion and food and beverage industries including Starbucks, Nike, Adidas, and Balmain have adopted a tokenization strategy as a way to cultivate digital experiences and relationships directly with their audiences and offer new content distribution channels.\n\nLast October, Ripple brought a wave of NFT creators transforming the entertainment and media industry\u2014specifically music\u2014through its Creator Fund. Today, Ripple is unlocking new tokenization use cases on the XRP Ledger with creators focused on blending physical and digital experiences with real-world utility.\n\nIntroducing Wave 3 Winners of Ripple\u2019s Creator Fund\n\nSince XLS-20 hit Mainnet, the XRP Ledger saw hundreds of projects benefit from the XRP Ledger\u2019s low-cost, carbon-neutral, instant settlement, and built in royalty structures\u2014maximizing value for NFT creators and their communities to consume content.\n\nRipple has continued to invest in functional NFT projects through its Creator Fund, a $250 million commitment to foster innovation in tokenization. The Creator Fund provides financial, creative and technical support to help creators bring their phygital NFT projects to life on the XRPL, stretch the bounds of what\u2019s possible and explore new use cases for NFTs.\n\nThrough the Creator Fund, Ripple hopes to continue to accelerate the future of tokenization and digital experiences led by seven independent creators, including:\n\nHot Import Nights : Hot Import Nights is looking to leverage NFTs as tickets to access IRL events and exclusive merchandise only available to NFT holders. NFT holders will also be able to access a VIP area/lounge at all events using the NFT as \u201ca badge for entry.\u201d Michael Munar, President and CEO, comments, \u201cOver the past two decades, the HOT IMPORT NIGHTS\u00ae brand has always been about the future and innovation. What\u2019s more fitting than integrating blockchain technology for automotive enthusiasts to gain access to large scale events, exclusive merchandise drops, secret car meets, and obtain unique collectable NFT artwork? With the XRP Ledger\u2019s reliable and sustainable technology, we can now accomplish this to power real life experiences for HIN\u2019s global community.\u201d\n\nAdrian Balastegui : Adrian Balastegui is an artist that wants to blend the physical and digital art world through his canvas paintings. Offering his audience the ability to hold NFTs as digital assets in their wallets while printing and signing a one-of-a-kind physical canvas print, holders can also display the physical artwork.\n\nEmporio Records : Emporio Records is an independent record label looking to use NFTs as a way to engage with artists\u2019 fans and community by offering exclusive access to never-before-heard music, exclusive merchandise drops, and pre-purchases for concert tickets.

Sebastian J\u00e1come, CEO of Emporio Records adds, \u201cThanks to the Creator Fund, we are now empowered to collaborate with talented individuals in Latin America to bring forth many collections of imaginative and original NFTs. We are thrilled to join forces with the Ripple team to create a dynamic portfolio of NFTs that resonate with fans of Emporio Records artists. By doing so, we aim to strengthen our bond with our dedicated fanbase and establish a long-lasting connection with them.\u201d\n\nMike Sotirakos : Mike Sotirakos is a creative mind that wants to help artists enter the digital world of NFTs while still offering the element of \u201creal life\u201d art pieces. Working with artists like Lorenzo Quinn, Mike is helping accelerate the transitions from physical to digital art while simultaneously offering the art piece to collectors. Creating physical artwork pieces and launching a digital NFT brings traditional art collectors into the digital space. Sotirakos adds that he \u201csees the XRPL as the perfect ecosystem to transact high-value art and collections efficiently and safely through NFTs. The XRPL has always been focused on facilitating transactionality and value representation and is widely adopted around the world, making it the ideal partner for XRPStudio and our renowned artists.\u201d\n\nNatacha Einat : Natacha is an artist that wants to extend her NFT offerings into physical prints.
