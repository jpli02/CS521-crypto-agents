        "title": "Scientists manage to harvest energy from ripples in graphene - Interesting Engineering",
        "content": "These ripples behave like tiny waves, moving up and down in response to changes in the surrounding temperature.\n\nThibado and his team designed a unique circuit to extract energy from these ripples. The circuit consists of a junction followed by two diodes wired in opposition with a non-linear resistor. A diode is an electronic component that allows current to flow in only one direction.\n\nThe circuit design was chosen to overcome the condition set by the second law of thermodynamics, which says that useful energy can\u2019t be collected when both the circuit and the ripples are in thermal equilibrium, even if we use a diode.\n\nUsing the unique setup with two diodes, the team found that they could slow down the process.\n\nAs the circuit interacts with the particles in Brownian motion, it temporarily breaks equilibrium, allowing current to flow between the diodes and the charging of storage capacitors. This entire process occurs while adhering to thermodynamics\u2019 first and second laws."

        "content": "Contrary to previous reports by CryptoGeek, our understanding, as of now, suggests no such involvement by Ripple in such projects. Ripple is currently only involved in the development of CBDCs in Hong Kong, Bhutan, Palau, Colombia, and Montenegro. We will promptly update if any verified information emerges regarding Ripple\u2019s association with other CBDC initiatives.\n\n\n\nIn May 2023, Ripple (XRP) announced a new venture in the realm of digital finance: the launch of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform.\n\nThis dynamic platform empowers central banks, governments, and financial institutions to take charge of their digital currency issuance, distribution, and management.\n\nUtilizing Ripple\u2019s advanced technology and building upon their earlier Private Ledger project, this platform harnesses the power of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to pave the way for a new era of customizable and efficient CBDCs.\n\nImpressively, even though the new ledger was launched just three months ago, over 8 countries are already building CBDCs on XRP Ledger, blockchain news aggregator CryptoGeek revealed on August 19.\n\nThese include Russia, the Republic of Palau, Montenegro, Japan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Uruguay, New Zealand, and Hong Kong.\n\nCountries building CBDCs on XRPL. Source: CryptoGeek\n\nOver 15% of all countries may use XRPL as CBDC platform\n\nLast month, James Wallis, the Vice President of Central Bank engagements and CBDCs at Ripple, said the blockchain company is in talks with more than 30 countries to adopt its XRPL-powered CBDC platform.\n\nAt the time, Wallis said Ripple publicly announced partnerships with 5 central banks, while 5 were not disclosed to the public yet. In addition, Ripple was in conversations with 20 more countries to offer them its private or public XRP ledger as a base for developing CBDCs.\n\nGiven that there are a total of 195 countries in the world, this suggests that more than 15% of global nations are considering using Ripple\u2019s technology for building CBDCs.\n\nXRP\u2019s role\n\nWhen Ripple announced a private XRP Ledger for CBDCs in 2021, the tech company said the cryptocurrency could \u201cbe leveraged as a neutral bridge asset for frictionless value movement between CBDCs and other currencies.\u201d\n\nHowever, although its private ledger is based on XRPL, it \u201cdoes not require XRP to operate.\u201d In other words, central banks who opt to build CBDCs on Ripple\u2019s platform do not use or interact with the crypto token."

        "content": "XRP price recovered over the weekend with no new filings from the regulator or Ripple in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit.\n\nSEC addressed XRP as a \u201cdigital asset security\u201d in its first lawsuit but is now taking a different approach.\n\nThe financial regulator argues digital assets have no inherent value and are nothing but computer code.\n\nThe ongoing SEC vs Ripple saga had no new updates over the weekend, and the XRP community of holders watched and waited as experts analyzed where the financial regulator is headed next. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) said in its recent motion for interlocutory appeal that digital assets do not have an inherent value and are nothing more than computer code.\n\nThe statement made by the financial regulator is in stark contrast to the beginning of the lawsuit where the SEC referred to XRP as a \u201cdigital asset security.\u201d\n\nThe shift in the SEC\u2019s stance has fueled hope, of Judge Torres\u2019 ruling on XRP being a \u201cnon-security\u201d remaining intact. The regulator appears focused on the programmatic sales of the altcoin by payment giant Ripple.\n\nAlso read: SEC vs Ripple, the legal battle intensifies as XRP holders expect new changes from SEC appeal\n\nSEC appeal likely focused on programmatic sales of XRP, not its security status\n\nExperts in the crypto and XRP community utilized the weekend to analyze the news of SEC\u2019s motion for interlocutory appeal being accepted by the court. As both parties prepare to file new motions and responses by the scheduled deadlines, experts note the shift in the regulator\u2019s stance.\n\nThe SEC had initially maintained that XRP, the native token of XRPLedger, is a \u201cdigital asset security,\u201d in its lawsuit against Ripple. The regulator states that digital assets have no inherent value and are nothing more than computer code in its latest filing.\n\nIn its filing, the SEC reveals that the regulator did not argue that the asset underlying the investment contract was necessarily a security and it does not seek an appellate review of any holding relevant to the same in its case against Ripple.\n\nSEC motion for filing of interlocutory appeal\n\nThe interpretation of the SEC\u2019s stance by Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett and pro-XRP attorney John Deaton ushers relief in the community of XRP holders.\n\nWith no new filings from the SEC or Ripple over the weekend, XRP price recovered from its decline and climbed past resistance at $0.55. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading at $0.5291 on Binance. XRP price has rallied 25% from last week\u2019s low of $0.4228 (Aug 17) to by early Monday."

Such uncertainty poses challenges for legitimate crypto projects and creates room for fraudulent activities to thrive.

Such uncertainty poses challenges for legitimate crypto projects and creates room for fraudulent activities to thrive. Such is the case for Ripple and Celsius, two recent controversies making waves in the crypto world.\n\nMatt Stankiewicz is a Managing Counsel at The Volkov Law Group. His expertise includes financial regulation and compliance, with a focus on securities, anti-money laundering (AML), and cryptocurrency regulation. Given his professional background and interest in crypto regulations, he is a frequent speaker on legal matters concerning cryptocurrency exchanges and the SEC.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear Michael and Matt discuss:\n\n* The SEC faces criticism for its unclear stance on cryptocurrency regulations. Such uncertainty poses challenges for legitimate crypto projects and creates room for fraudulent activities to thrive.\n\n* The Ripple case offers a complex view into how cryptocurrencies are perceived legally. While some sales of XRP tokens were considered securities, others weren\u2019t, a distinction that has sent ripples through the crypto world. The case\u2019s broader implications, especially with the SEC\u2019s decision being appealed, hold immense importance for other companies in similar situations.\n\n* Bad actors can exploit innovative technologies and make things worse for everyone else. With the CEO and CRO of Celsius charged with fraud and numerous questionable practices coming to light, the importance of stringent regulations and monitoring becomes abundantly clear.\n\n* Strong compliance programs serve as bulwarks against fraudsters and those under sanctions, ultimately safeguarding both the platform and its users. However, regulating an asset as novel and dynamic as cryptocurrency is no easy feat. Critics claim the SEC\u2019s approach leans more toward enforcement than establishing clear rules.\n\n* Matt underscores the importance of erecting a sturdy compliance structure within the cryptocurrency industry. He emphasizes that such programs are not just regulatory measures but critical tools to ward off fraudsters and maintain the industry\u2019s reputation.\n\nKEY QUOTES\n\n\u201c[Crypto] is a brand new asset. It\u2019s virtually impossible to pigeonhole it to any other kind of real-world asset right now.\u201d \u2013 Matt Stankiewicz\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cripple the good projects because there\u2019s some bad people out there.\u201d \u2013 Matt Stankiewicz\n\n\u201cThe SEC just says, well, \u2018You should know. You\u2019ve got to figure it out; we\u2019re not your attorneys.\u2019 Which is fair in some regard, right? But that said, it\u2019s not helpful. The SEC needs to provide some kind of guidance here.\u201d \u2013 Matt Stankiewicz See less -"
