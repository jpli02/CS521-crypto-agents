        "title": "Ripple Price Analysis: The Calm Before the Storm? XRP About to Lose Key Support - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "After a period of steady price movements, Ripple has finally moved \u2013 toward a bearish trajectory. This decline has led to a breakdown below a critical support zone defined by the 200-day moving average.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA closer look at the daily chart shows a notable drop in XRP price due to elevated selling pressure and an increasing bearish sentiment.\n\nThe price slipped beneath the crucial 100-day MA at $0.55, reaching the 200-day moving average at $0.5. This downward movement has disrupted the bullish trend, resulting in a rejection.\n\nHowever, a sudden rebound pushed the price back above the 200-day moving average (the Grayscale\u2019s win over the SEC pump), only to reencounter rejection, leading to another dip below the significant MA. This particular support area carries substantial weight, and if support holds, it has the potential to halt further declines.\n\nNevertheless, a breakdown below the 200-day MA, followed by a subsequent pullback, could signal the beginning of a medium to long-term bearish trend.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nAlthough the price initially found support upon reaching this pivotal trendline and produced a modest recovery, it ultimately faced rejection, leading to a break beneath this supportive trendline.\n\nNonetheless, this breakout will only be confirmed once the price retraces to retest the broken trendline and forms a pullback. Such a scenario could potentially drive the price towards lower thresholds, with the likelihood of a drop towards the static support at $0.42 increasing.\n\nConversely, if buyers effectively maintain the price in the area of this pivotal trendline, the breakout may be considered a false alarm, possibly triggering a new rally toward the $0.85 mark.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, continuous caution in monitoring price fluctuations remains crucial, as the interplay between support and resistance levels is poised to significantly impact Ripple\u2019s immediate price trajectory."

        "content": "Blockchain analytics firm Santiment says that XRP is seeing a massive rise in on-chain volume as development activity surrounding the digital asset ramps up.\n\nAccording to the market intelligence platform, XRP, the token associated with Ripple Lab\u2019s payments platform, kicked off September with the highest on-chain volume it has seen since February 1st along with a notable spike in development activity.\n\n\u201cXRP is seeing major utility spikes to start the month. In addition to today\u2019s milestone highs in on-chain transaction volume (4.8 billion XRP) and circulation (2.03 billion XRP), the development activity for the 5th-largest cap asset in crypto is up big as well.\u201d\n\nXRP, which had its automated, open-market sales deemed to not be securities in July after a lengthy legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is trading for $0.496 at time of writing, a 1.09% increase during the last 24 hours.\n\nLooking at the crypto king, Santiment says that Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) latest dip \u2013 which saw it fall back down to prices not seen since June \u2013 is due to the fear, doubt, and uncertainty (FUD) surrounding the potential rejection of spot market BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.\n\nThe analytics firm also notes that the FUD lingers even after the SEC lost a lawsuit against Grayscale over the rejection of the crypto firm\u2019s bid to create a Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cBTC has started September by falling to $25,400, its lowest price level since June 16th. Traders have a growing concern that the SEC may not be willing to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, even after Grayscale\u2019s victory. Expect FUD to dominate at least through the weekend.\u201d\n\nSantiment is also looking at the supply of stablecoins accumulated by crypto whales as the metric could foreshadow Bitcoin\u2019s next move to either $30,000 or $25,000.\n\n\u201cWhales are being particularly indecisive on stablecoin accumulation. A tried and true method for predicting where crypto heads next is analyzing big wallets to see the ratio of stablecoins they hold. A rise in their buying power would signal a bounce.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $25,797 at time of writing, a 1.2% increase during the last day.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The XRP price has been showing promises of a price spike since Ripple\u2019s victory against the US SEC. Many community members are currently keeping a close eye on the cryptocurrency, and hoping for a significant price increase. One crypto analyst, in particular, has predicted a massive run for the altcoin that could see its price hit triple-digits.\n\nXRP Predicted To Reach $130 In Next Bull Run\n\nFollowing its partial victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July after Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple labs, XRP, the native token of Ripple, has fluctuated heavily despite the positive sentiment surrounding it. Nevertheless, an analyst sees a potential bull run for the altcoin.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCan Ripple Control The XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In 9 months ago\n\nCrypto analyst and XRP influencer, XRP Captain, has predicted a significant price jump for the XRP token on an X (formerly Twitter) post. XRP Captain shared a chart with a symmetrical triangle pattern which he used to predict XRP\u2019s $130 future price movement.\n\nApparently, XRP has a history of symmetrical triangle patterns. In 2017, the cryptocurrency broke out of a similar symmetrical triangle pattern which pushed the token to new all-time highs. As for when this will happen, the analyst points toward the expected 2024 bull run.\n\nCan You Imagine The Magnitude When This Breakout Happens\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5??

Earlier in August, a pseudonymous analyst also predicted a massive rally for XRP that could see the token reaching its previous all-time high of $3.\n\nIn this case, the analyst highlighted that the XRP/BTC pair had finally reclaimed the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, and the last time this had happened had also been back in 2017. This led to an over 500% increase in the price of the altcoin at the time.\n\nThis is the first time we have seen this for $XRP in 5 years! \ud83d\ude31$XRP / $BTC on the monthly timeframe has reclaimed the 20 and 50 SMA. \ud83d\udcc8 Not only this, but it has also wicked back to the 50 SMA to test it as support (if we continue to hold out the month). \ud83c\udfaf The last time we\u2026 pic.twitter.com/d5zjzwcTvm \u2014 Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) August 13, 2023\n\nToken continues to fluctuate above $0.5 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCrypto Community Uncertain About Analyst XRP Price Prediction\n\nFollowing XRP Captain\u2019s prediction of XRP\u2019s possible bull run, other crypto analysts have also shared their thoughts on the sheer incredulity of the prediction.\n\nAnother crypto trader and chartist, JD was enthusiastic about the technical patterns XRP price charts were displaying. He explained that the symmetrical triangle was accurately represented. However, he could not see the price of XRP reaching three digits.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t see that 3 digit target. $20s are still in the cards though,\u201d he stated.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nPro-XRP Legal Expert Takes The Spotlight With Daring Ripple Vs SEC Settlement Theory 9 months ago\n\nXRP price has also been notably down. However, XRP Whales are not deterred as these large investors are taking advantage of the market downturns and buying up hundreds of millions worth of tokens.\n\nXRP is currently looking toward a reversal with its price seeing meager gains of 0.02% in the last day. However, it is still struggling on the weekly chart with losses of 2.61%.\n\nFeatured image from Zipmex, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "Better Buy: Ripple vs. Shiba Inu - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Stuck between stable and speculative? Let's take a deep dive into the differences between two popular cryptocurrencies and find out which is the better buy.\n\nJudging by the headlines they generate, you might think of Shiba Inu (SHIB 0.86%) as a larger, more popular cryptocurrency than Ripple (XRP 0.22%). The XRP Official channel on X (formerly known as Twitter) has 382,000 followers with their eyes on Ripple's news and plans. Shiba Inu's Shibtoken account boasts 3.7 million X followers. The dog-themed crypto could make a claim for the popularity crown based on its social media presence alone.\n\nHowever, that's only true from a popularity standpoint. Ripple is absolutely a more serious business, and it shows in the cryptocurrency's financial metrics. The XRP token (commonly known as Ripple) comes with a much larger market footprint and more intense trading activity despite lacking social media muscle.\n\nBut which cryptocurrency is the better buy today? Is it Shiba Inu, the dog-themed joke currency with a deceptively sophisticated technical platform? Or is it Ripple, the business-minded system for efficient international payments?\n\nLet's say I own one of these coins but not the other and have no plans to flip that setup anytime soon. Let me explain why I continue to recommend Ripple over Shiba Inu, no matter how hard the smaller coin's mascot blinks those puppy eyes at me.\n\nMetric Ripple (XRP) Shiba Inu Market cap $49.6 billion $4.6 billion Average daily trading volume (30 days) $1,046 million $132 million X (Twitter) followers 382,000 3.7 million Platform Unique blockchain system, confirming transactions across a federated consensus network. There are currently 137 of these validator servers, all affiliated with the Ripple Labs organization. ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, boosted by the Shibarium layer-two solution. Real-world applications Settling international money transfers, with automatic conversion between different source and destination currencies. App development, digital payments, NFT tokens, and more.\n\nRipple: A proven global payments system\n\nAs you can see, Shiba Inu may hog the spotlight, but Ripple is making things happen in the real world.\n\nThe RippleNet payment system processes thousands of border-crossing payments every day. This was true even while American crypto exchanges kept their hands off the XRP token due to potential legal trouble from the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) long-running lawsuit.\n\nAnd here's a curious detail. Judge Analisa Torres dismissed two of the SEC's three lawsuit claims on July 13, and most U.S. crypto exchanges enabled XRP trading within 24 hours. There was a brief spike in XRP's payment transactions but no real change in Ripple's healthy transaction volumes.\n\nIn other words, the world watched America return to the XRP market, only to shrug and keep doing business as usual. This was always a global payment service anyway, perfectly capable of running a useful service without American participation.\n\nSo, Ripple has been running a successful business for years and is building on that proven platform as we speak. Governments and regulators are doing test runs of XRP-based stablecoins to serve as official digital currencies in several countries. The Ripple Liquidity Hub has become a powerful currency exchange tool with endpoints in over 50 countries.\n\nEnabling low-cost international transactions in the blink of an eye, Ripple offers a much-needed service. This is a system I can get behind, and I'm glad to have a few XRP tokens in my digital pocket.\n\nShiba Inu: A cute and refined community experiment\n\nNow, Shiba Inu is not a complete joke. This whimsical crypto project keeps impressing me with its technical sophistication.\n\nShiba Inu is based on a serious whitepaper with a silly name. The token was launched as an experiment in community-driven project management, and the Shiba Inu community takes an active interest in keeping the technical platform current. The recent Shibarium launch was a success, for example, adding a Layer 2 network to boost the transaction processing speed, among other benefits.\n\nAnd the platform's technology is surprisingly sophisticated. Shiba Inu is supported by the Bone governance token and the limited-supply Leash token, which serves as a customer loyalty reward for longtime Shiba Inu holders. Together, the three Ethereum-based tokens form the ShibaSwap decentralized finance (DeFi) system.\n\nYou can earn staking rewards, mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), provide funds for your project through a built-in liquidity system, and more. These business-like actions have adorable names, so you dig for liquidity and bury tokens for staking while earning woof rewards. It adds up to a brilliant marketing program, taking the Dogecoin silliness to a new level and wrapping it in layers of serious utility.\n\nWhy I prefer Ripple over Shiba Inu\n\nDon't get me wrong; Shiba Inu is more than just a flash in the pan. Its technological platform is surprisingly robust, and its community is engaged and passionate. But in the cold, hard arena of investment choices, Ripple comes out ahead for me.\n\nYou might prefer Shiba Inu over Ripple due to its community-driven management and potentially wider range of applications. The token also comes with Ethereum's ironclad security and that dog-themed media presence we looked at earlier.\n\nYet, Shiba Inu is not the no-brainer platform people use when building a new DeFi app or minting an NFT. Ethereum is the undisputed king in both cases.\n\nShiba Inu attempts to do many different things at once but doesn't excel at any of them. Ripple does one thing very well. One of these projects is run like a business, the other like a community experiment.\n\nThe business-minded Ripple token is the clear choice for long-term investors. This global payments system is gaining traction in the market, in the courtroom, and among governments considering digital currency options. Shiba Inu is a good boy but hardly suitable as a watchdog for my crypto-investing portfolio."
