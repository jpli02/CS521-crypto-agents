        "content": "Geoff Bennett:\n\nLet's expand our horizons a bit wider and look at important findings that are literally about space-time and the cosmos as we know it.\n\nYou might remember that Albert Einstein theorized that as heavy objects move through time and space, they create ripple effects in the fabric of our universe. Now an international team of scientists have detected new evidence of that. Researchers found new signs of gravitational waves, waves that are affected by huge movements, such as the collision of black holes.\n\nThese are no small matters.\n\nOur science correspondent, Miles O'Brien, is here to break it down.\n\nSo, Miles, Albert Einstein was apparently, what, 100 years ahead of his time in predicting these gravitational waves. What are they exactly?"

        "title": "Gravitational Waves Should Change How You See the World - The Atlantic",
        "content": "The whole universe is humming. Actually, the whole universe is Mongolian throat singing. Every star, every planet, every continent, every building, every person is vibrating along to the slow cosmic beat.\n\nThat\u2019s the takeaway from yesterday\u2019s remarkable announcement that scientists have detected a \u201ccosmic background\u201d of ripples in the structure of space and time. If the result bears up as more data are gathered, it\u2019s a discovery that promises to open new windows on everything from the evolution of galaxies to the origin of the universe.\n\nScientists had been awaiting such a discovery for decades. More than 100 years ago, Einstein introduced his radical general theory of relativity. For Einstein, space and time were a single entity, \u201cspace-time,\u201d comprising a flexible fabric that could be stretched and compressed, bent and warped. In general relativity, matter makes space-time bend, and space-time, in turn, guides how unconstrained matter will move. Because space-time is flexible, you can make it wave. Just like snapping a bedsheet, if you move enough matter around fast enough, a wave of distorted space-time will ripple outward into the universe.\n\nScientists predicted the existence of these ripples, called gravitational waves, as far back as the 1910s. But because the distortions they create in space-time are so minute, they weren\u2019t detected until eight years ago. That\u2019s when physicists used mile-long lasers to catch distortions in space-time from two black holes colliding in a distant galaxy. With that first epochal discovery, the doors to gravitational-wave science were thrown open. Since then, scientists have found many other merging black-hole pairs. But an even fainter signal carrying a profound cosmic significance still lay out of their reach.\n\nRead: What gravitational waves sound like\n\nAlong with signals from discrete black-hole mergers, experts believed that a background of gravitational waves should also be washing through the universe, the space-time equivalent of car horns, jackhammers, and shouts all combining into the diffuse cacophony of city life. Plenty of cosmic phenomena could produce such a gravitational-wave background, and astronomers are now busily debating the most likely explanation. Perhaps the culprits are the zillions of supermassive black holes, some billions of times heavier than the sun, that reside at the center of every galaxy. Over cosmic timescales, galaxies collide and merge\u2014and so do their black holes. These are near-apocalyptic events in terms of their effect on space-time, like a wall of speakers at a heavy-metal concert blasting against so many eardrums. Untold numbers of galaxies have merged across the 13.8-billion-year life of the universe, and those blasts should still be echoing in the background of space-time today. And so, perhaps, should the gravitational waves from the birth of the universe itself. The Big Bang was, well, a big bang. Initiating the expansion of everything required so much energy, and did so much violence, that it should have flooded space-time with gravitational waves that continue to ricochet around the universe to this day.\n\nIf scientists could find and analyze this background, they\u2019d have a direct look all the way back to the first slivers of time after the moment of creation. First, however, they\u2019d have to prove it exists. And now it seems they might have. A team of astronomers from around the world, working together as the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (a.k.a. NANOGrav), made the detection using the rapidly spinning cinders of once-massive stars called pulsars. Pulsars emit bursts of radio waves so perfectly timed that they serve as one of the universe\u2019s most accurate natural clocks. Through 15 long years of sweat and perseverance, the NANOGrav scientists patiently tracked tiny changes in the burst patterns of 67 pulsars scattered across the Milky Way.\n\nThey found that a small change in the period of any one pulsar\u2019s signal was linked to changes in the others\u2019. These linked anomalies, they concluded, were reflections of changes in the distance between Earth and the pulsars as passing space-time ripples caused those distances to continually grow and shrink. Putting it all together, the NANOGrav scientists could see that these ripples were not from one discrete source but from a din, a hum, the overlapping echoes of disturbances scattered across the universe.\n\nRead: Why Earth\u2019s history appears so miraculous\n\nOver the course of a decade and a half, the NANOGrav team pored over their machines, their numbers, and their mathematical theory to bring us proof that something miraculous\u2014something wonderful\u2014is happening right under our noses. Actually, it\u2019s happening to our noses, and the rest of our bodies as well. Every gravitational wave in that background the NANOGrav team found is humming through the very constitution of the space you inhabit right now. Every proton and neutron in every atom from the tip of your toes to the top of your head is shifting, shuttling, and vibrating in a collective purr within which the entire history of the universe is implicated. And if you put your hand down on a chair or table or anything else nearby, that object, too, is dancing that slow waltz.\n\nThe gravitational-wave background is huge news for the cosmos, yes, but it\u2019s also huge news for you. The nature of reality has not changed\u2014you will not suddenly be able to detect vibrations in your morning coffee that you couldn\u2019t see before. And yet, moments like these can and should change how each of us sees our world. All of a sudden, we know that we are humming in tune with the entire universe, that each of us contains the signature of everything that has ever been. It\u2019s all within us, around us, pushing us to and fro as we hurtle through the cosmos.\n\nAs an astronomer, I am often asked about UFOs. I\u2019m pretty skeptical about them having anything to do with alien life, but I believe the questions represent something ancient and innate in us all. As children, each of us had a deep and easily triggered sense that the world is full of wonder, that everything is strange and amazing. Stepping out into the backyard, we\u2019d get entranced staring at an anthill or watching leaves pirouette as they fell. As a toddler, my daughter would purposely tip her cup over just to be delighted by how the water spilled across the table.\n\nRead: Why everyone is suddenly talking about aliens\n\nToday, gifted with a new understanding of the architecture of the universe, each of us has an opportunity to revisit that wonder. After you finish reading this, take a look around you. Ponder how the solid-seeming ground beneath your feet is quietly shaking with the force of billions of years of cosmic collisions. Go outside, if you can, and watch the wind blow through the trees. Perhaps the experience will be different now that you know how the rhythm of giant black holes in distant galaxies also beats out a time in the trees\u2019 gentle swaying.\n\nThe universe is an impossibly vast symphony of cause and effect. The endless comings and goings of galaxies, stars, and planets create a melding of songs that you are part of too. The NANOGrav discovery exposes the intricacy and gracefulness of that melding. It\u2019s a reminder that the world always has been, and always will be, worthy of wonder. But of course, you already knew that. You always have."

        "title": "Facebook content moderators in Kenya call the work 'torture.' Their lawsuit may ripple worldwide - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 On the verge of tears, Nathan Nkunzimana recalled watching a video of a child being molested and another of a woman being killed.\n\nEight hours a day, his job as a content moderator for a Facebook contractor required him to look at horrors so the world wouldn\u2019t have to. Some overwhelmed colleagues would scream or cry, he said.\n\nNow, Nkunzimana is among nearly 200 former employees in Kenya who are suing Facebook and local contractor Sama over working conditions that could have implications for social media moderators around the world. It is the first known court challenge outside the United States, where Facebook settled with moderators in 2020.\n\nThe group was employed at the social media giant\u2019s outsourced hub for content moderation in Kenya\u2019s capital of Nairobi, where workers screen posts, videos, messages and other content from users across Africa, removing any illegal or harmful material that breaches its community standards and terms of service.\n\nThe moderators from several African countries are seeking a $1.6 billion compensation fund after alleging poor working conditions, including insufficient mental health support and low pay. Earlier this year, they were laid off by Sama as it left the business of content moderation. They assert that the companies are ignoring a court order for their contracts to be extended until the case is resolved.\n\nFacebook and Sama have defended their employment practices.\n\nWith little certainty of how long the case will take to conclude, the moderators expressed despair as money and work permits run out and they wrestle with the traumatic images that haunt them.\n\n\u201cIf you feel comfortable browsing and going through the Facebook page, it is because there\u2019s someone like me who has been there on that screen, checking, \u2018Is this okay to be here?\u2019\u201d Nkunzimana, a father of three from Burundi, told The Associated Press in Nairobi.\n\nThe 33-year-old said content moderation is like \u201csoldiers\u201d taking a bullet for Facebook users, with workers watching harmful content showing killing, suicide and sexual assault and making sure it is taken down.\n\nFor Nkunzimana and others, the job began with a sense of pride, feeling like they were \u201cheroes to the community,\u201d he said.\n\nBut as the exposure to alarming content reignited past traumas for some like him who had fled political or ethnic violence back home, the moderators found little support and a culture of secrecy.\n\nThey were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements. Personal items like phones were not allowed at work.\n\nAfter his shift, Nkuzimana would go home exhausted and often locked himself in his bedroom to try to forget what he had seen. Even his wife had no idea what his job was like.\n\nThese days, he locks himself in his room to avoid his sons\u2019 questions about why he\u2019s no longer working and why they likely can no longer afford school fees. The salary for content moderators was $429 per month, with non-Kenyans getting a small expat allowance on top of that.\n\nThe Facebook contractor, U.S.-based Sama, did little to ensure post-traumatic professional counseling was offered to moderators in its Nairobi office, Nkuzimana said. He said counselors were poorly trained to deal with what his colleagues were experiencing. Now, with no mental health care, he immerses himself in church instead.\n\nFacebook parent Meta has said its contractors are contractually obliged to pay their employees above the industry standard in the markets they operate and provide on-site support by trained practitioners.\n\nA spokesman said Meta could not comment on the Kenya case.\n\nIn an email to the AP, Sama said the salaries it offered in Kenya were four times the local minimum wage and that \u201cover 60% of male employees and over 70% of female employees were living below the international poverty line (less than $1.90 a day)\u201d before being hired.\n\nSama said all employees had unlimited access to one-on-one counseling \u201cwithout fear of repercussions.\u201d The contractor also called a recent court decision to extend the moderators\u2019 contracts \u201cconfusing\u201d and asserted that a later ruling pausing that decision means it has not gone into effect.\n\nSuch work has the potential to be \u201cincredibly psychologically damaging,\u201d but job-seekers in lower-income countries might take the risk in exchange for an office job in the tech industry, said Sarah Roberts, an expert in content moderation at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nIn countries like Kenya, where there is plenty of cheap labor available, the outsourcing of such sensitive work is \u201ca story of an exploitative industry predicated on using global economic inequity to its advantage, doing harm and then taking no responsibility because the firms can be like, \u2018Well, we never employed so-and-so, that was, you know, the third party,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition, the mental health care provided might not be \u201cthe cream of the crop\u201d and concerns have been raised about the confidentiality of therapy, said Roberts, an associate professor of information studies.\n\nThe difference in the Kenya court case, she said, is that the moderators are organizing and pushing back against their conditions, creating unusual visibility. The usual tactic in such cases in the U.S. is to settle, she said, but \u201cif cases are brought in other places, that might not be so easy for the companies to do that.\u201d\n\nFacebook invested in moderation hubs worldwide after being accused of allowing hate speech to circulate in countries like Ethiopia and Myanmar, where conflicts were killing thousands of people and harmful content was posted in a variety of local languages.\n\nSought for their fluency in various African languages, content moderators hired by Sama in Kenya soon found themselves looking at graphic content that hit painfully close to home.\n\nThe two years that Fasica Gebrekidan worked as a moderator roughly overlapped with the war in her native Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region, where hundreds of thousands of people were killed and many Tigrayans like her knew little about their loved ones\u2019 fate.\n\nAlready suffering from having to flee the conflict, the 28-year-old spent her workday looking at \u201cgruesome\u201d videos and other content overwhelmingly related to the war, including rape. With videos, she had to watch the first 50 seconds and the last 50 seconds to reach a decision on whether it should be taken down.\n\nThe feeling of gratitude she\u2019d had upon landing the job quickly disappeared.\n\n\u201cYou run away from the war, then you have to see the war,\u201d Fasica said. \u201cIt was just a torture for us.\u201d\n\nShe now has no income and no permanent home. She said she would be looking for new opportunities if she could only feel normal again. A former journalist, she can\u2019t bring herself to write anymore, even as an outlet for her emotions.\n\nFasica worries that \u201cthis garbage\u201d will stay in her head forever. While speaking with the AP, she kept her eyes on a painting across the caf\u00e9, deep red with what appeared to be a man in distress. It bothered her.\n\nFasica blames Facebook for a lack of proper mental health care and pay and accuses the local contractor of using her and letting her go.\n\n\u201cFacebook should know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should care about us.\u201d\n\nThe fate of the moderators\u2019 complaint lies with the Kenyan court, with the next hearing on July 10.\n\nThe uncertainty is frustrating, Fasica said. Some moderators are giving up and returning to their home countries, but that is not yet an option for her.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed from London."

        "title": "WVU Today | WVU faculty, students contribute to cosmic breakthrough uncovering evidence of low-frequency ... - WVU Today",
        "content": "Researchers at West Virginia University \u2014 working as part of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, or NANOGrav, collaboration \u2014 utilized the Green Bank Telescope in Pocahontas County to help uncover evidence of low-frequency gravitational waves for the first time. (Submitted Photo/Jay Young, Green Bank Observatory)\n\nMore than two dozen researchers with ties to West Virginia University have helped unearth evidence of ripples in spacetime that have never been observed before now.\n\nGravitational waves travel outwards from a source at light speed, stretching and squeezing the very fabric of spacetime \u2014 for instance, making the length of a ruler longer or shorter, or making time tick a little faster or slower as the wave passes. The first evidence for these ripples at very low frequencies was identified by a cohort of nearly 200 scientists from the United States and Canada. These low-frequency oscillations happen with periods of years to decades and were recognized through high-precision timing of cosmic radio clocks called pulsars.\n\nThis result emerged from 15 years of data acquired by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, or NANOGrav, which includes many researchers from the WVU Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology.\n\nOf the 95 authors documenting this evidence in newly published papers, 30 are associated with WVU, including 11 authors currently at the University and 19 from past years, generally those trained as undergraduate students, graduate students or postdoctoral researchers.\n\nMaura McLaughlin, Eberly Distinguished Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, and director of the Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology, was a founding member of the NANOGrav collaboration and serves as co-director of the NANOGrav Physics Frontier Center. She is also a member of the international team of scientists collaborating globally on the International Pulsar Timing Array project.\n\n\u201cNANOGrav and its international partners have discovered the first evidence for a background hum of gravitational waves,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cThe universe is not static and never changing \u2014 we are awash in a space that is constantly stretching and squeezing.\u201d\n\nA series of papers on NANOGrav\u2019s findings and observations has been published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\n\u201cThe papers describe the evidence as arising from a \u2018gravitational wave background,\u2019 which refers to the indiscernible signals coming from many sources of gravitational waves in the universe,\u201d said Sarah Burke-Spolaor, assistant professor at WVU, who founded NANOGrav\u2019s Astrophysics Working Group in 2011.\n\n\u201cThis can be understood by thinking about a huge orchestra tuning up their instruments: you know it\u2019s an orchestra, and know there are many instruments, but can\u2019t necessarily make one out specifically. We don\u2019t yet know what is giving rise to this signal, but our publications discuss several possibilities: supermassive black holes in galaxy mergers, cosmic strings and relic echoes of the big bang.\u201d\n\nOne popular theory is that pairs of supermassive black holes orbiting one another could be the dominant source of these low-frequency gravitational waves. The black holes are estimated to be billions of times the mass of the sun.\n\nSupermassive black holes are believed to reside at the centers of the largest galaxies in the universe, although they have never been directly detected. When two galaxies merge, black holes from each wind up sinking to the center of the newly combined galaxy, orbiting each other as a binary system. Ultimately, the two black holes also merge. In the meantime, they stretch and squeeze the fabric of spacetime, generating gravitational waves that propagate away from their origin galaxy like ripples in a pond.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first gravitational wave breakthrough involving WVU. Sean McWilliams, associate professor of physics and astronomy, was part of the team in 2015 that detected gravitational waves for the first time, confirming Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. That finding was made possible by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, detectors.\n\nBut unlike the fleeting high-frequency gravitational waves seen by ground-based instruments like LIGO, the low-frequency signal observed by NANOGrav could be perceived only with a detector much larger than the Earth. To meet that need, astronomers turned a sector of the Milky Way galaxy into a gravitational wave antenna by making use of pulsars, the ultra-dense remnants of a star\u2019s core following a supernova explosion. When observed from Earth, pulsars appear to \u201cpulse,\u201d making them useful as precise cosmic timepieces. NANOGrav\u2019s effort collected data from 68 pulsars to form a type of detector called a pulsar timing array.\n\n\u201cGravitational waves were not directly detected until LIGO,\u201d said Emmanuel Fonseca, assistant professor of astronomy and NANOGrav member who was involved in the new discovery. \u201cBut it could only observe gravitational waves within a certain part of the spectrum, like seeing gravitational wave versions of optical light when there are gravitational wave versions of X-rays. What NANOGrav did was confirm the existence of gravitational waves at a completely different part of the spectrum.\u201d\n\nThe team relied heavily on the Green Bank Telescope located in Pocahontas County \u2014 the world\u2019s largest fully steerable radio telescope \u2014 for observation and data collection. The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the Very Large Array in New Mexico were also utilized.\n\n\u201cPulsars are actually very faint radio sources, so we require thousands of hours a year on the world\u2019s largest telescopes to carry out this experiment,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cThese results are made possible through the National Science Foundation\u2019s continued commitment to these exceptionally sensitive radio observatories.\u201d\n\nBurke-Spolaor said this newest discovery is a testament to the University\u2019s expertise and dedication to the space sciences.\n\n\u201cWVU is one of maybe two or three universities that serve as a major hub for all branches of science contributing to NANOGrav as a galaxy-sized detector that is beginning to detect the gravitational universe,\u201d she said. \u201cNANOGrav involves a unique detector \u2014 essentially using pulsars as a GPS system \u2014 and requires extensive work by experts on stellar evolution, gravity, fundamental physics, galaxy evolution and black holes. We have contributors at WVU who span that range. The University\u2019s close involvement with Green Bank Telescope has contributed a strong West Virginia-based network of scientists.\u201d\n\nBurke-Spolaor also applauded the skill and dedication of University students and postdoctoral researchers who contributed to the project.\n\nGraduate student Andrew Kaiser, of Fayetteville, Arkansas, has spent much of his research experience exploring and characterizing sources of noise and signals in gravitational wave detectors. For this discovery, Kaiser conducted statistical analyses included in the published papers.\n\n\u201cI analyzed specific pulsars by looking at noise and timing in a very myopic way,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that information, we can combine it with the statistics we use in our detections.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Arkansas, Kaiser wound up at WVU because of its opportunities in the field of gravitational waves.\n\n\u201cThere were really big exciting things happening in pulsar timing,\u201d he said. \u201cComing to WVU to witness the triumphs of pulsar timing firsthand has been one of the biggest things for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince coming here and joining NANOGrav, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about using gravitational waves and multi-messenger observations to search for and study sources,\u201d said Tingting Liu, a postdoctoral researcher originally from Nanjing, China.\n\nLiu explained that light is a messenger of astrophysical information, while gravitational waves are another messenger. When two or more messengers combine, that produces multi-messenger observations.\n\nThe team said future studies will enable scientists to view gravitational waves through a new window along with how the universe evolved on the largest scales, providing information about how often galaxies collide and what drives black holes to merge.\n\nResearchers also said they believe gravitational ripples of the Big Bang itself may make up a fraction of this new evidence, offering insight into how the universe was formed.\n\n-WVU-\n\njs/06/28/23\n\nMEDIA CONTACT: Holly Legleiter\n\nPublic Relations Coordinator\n\nWVU Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology\n\n304-685-5301; hlegleiter@mail.wvu.edu\n\nOR\n\nJake Stump\n\nDirector\n\nWVU Research Communications\n\n304-293-5507; jake.stump@mail.wvu.edu\n\n\n\nCall 1-855-WVU-NEWS for the latest West Virginia University news and information from WVUToday.\n\nFollow @WVUToday on Twitter."
