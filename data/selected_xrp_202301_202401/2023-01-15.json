        "content": "Kerry Kennedy praised Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for standing up to \"structural racism\" within the Royal Family, comparing them to her father Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nIn December, Prince Harry and his wife were recognized at the RFK Ripple of Hope Gala for \"their work on racial justice, mental health, and other social impact initiatives\".\n\nSpeaking to Spanish outlet El Confidencial at the event, Kerry Kennedy described the couple as \"heroic\" for standing up to structural racism within the Royal Family.\n\n\"When my father went to South Africa in 1966, he spoke to an all-white audience.... he said that few will have the courage to confront their colleagues and their fellows and their family and their community about the structures of power that they hold,\" Kennedy told the outlet in an interview recently obtained by the Daily Mail.\n\n\"That's what Meghan Markle and Prince Harry did.\n\n\"They went to the biggest institution, the longest-standing institution in all of British history, and they said: \"What we're doing is wrong. We can't have this structural racism within this institution',\" she added.\n\nKennedy said Harry and Meghan knew they would be ostracized for publically questioning the Royal Family but did it anyway because \"they couldn't live with themselves unless they questioned that authority\".\n\n\"I think they are very, very heroic to do that.\"\n\nHowever, Prince Harry has now claimed that he never accused his family members of being racist toward his wife.\n\nSpeaking to ITV's Tom Bradby ahead of the release of his memoirs \"Spare\", Prince Harry blamed the British press for exaggerating stories about him accusing his family of racism.\n\nBradby referred to an interview when Harry and Meghan claimed an unnamed member of the Royal Family questioned how dark Archie's skin would be, but Harry said he did not consider that concern to be racist.\n\n\"There was - there was concern about his skin color,\" Harry told Bradby.\n\n\"I wouldn't (consider that to be racist), not having lived within that family. The difference between racism and unconscious bias, the two things are different.\n\n\"But once it's been acknowledged, or pointed out to you as an individual, or as an institution, that you have unconscious bias, you, therefore, have an opportunity to learn and grow from that in order so that you are part of the solution rather than part of the problem.\n\n\"Otherwise unconscious bias then moves into the category of racism.\""

        "title": "What Is Flare Network? - OKX",
        "content": "One of the main goals of blockchain technology is achieving interoperability. This is essential for the advancement of Web3, but it also allows other blockchains to access new features. The Flare Network serves as a prime example, as it provides smart contract functionality to chains that lack it. This has the potential to revolutionize chains that were developed without this capability.\n\nThe Flare Network has its own blockchain, token, and various products and use cases. One notable use case is that of Ripple (XRP), where XRP holders can now access dApps and DeFi thanks to Flare. To fully grasp the capabilities of the Flare Network, it is important to understand its purpose and how it functions.\n\nWhat Is Flare Network?\n\nThe Flare Network is an EVM-based Layer 1 blockchain that enables developers to build interoperable applications. Unlike traditional decentralized applications, the ones built on Flare can interact with other blockchains. Flare is capable of bringing new use cases and monetization models simply by offering decentralized access to high-integrity data.\n\nThe network was founded by Hugo Philion (CEO), Nairi Usher (Chief Scientist), and Sean Rowan (CTO). The original goal of the network was to add smart contract functionality to networks such as Ripple, which lack it, in order to increase their functionality. The network's token was originally known as Spark.\n\nIn 2019, the project received a significant investment from Ripple's investment arm, Xpring. In 2021, the project also completed a funding round, raising $11.3 million. In December 2022, the network officially renamed its token to FLARE (FLR).\n\nAccording to Flare\u2019s latest model, the network aims to advance cross-chain functionality. Previously, token bridging was limited to mostly centralized systems, which resembled the traditional banking model. Decentralized alternatives were less efficient and less secure. However, Flare aims to change this by providing true, decentralized interoperability.\n\nHow Does Flare Network Work?\n\nFlare Network uses two interoperable protocols \u2014 the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO), and State Connector. The State Connector is used for consensus on data from external blockchains to be made on-chain, directly. As for the FTSO, it is a decentralized oracle that delivers off-chain data to the blockchain.\n\nThe combination of the two allows decentralized applications to use real-time information across the blockchains. Furthermore, the network also focuses on providing inputs for DeFi platforms. So far, standard decentralized systems struggled to obtain consensus. This is why Flare network and its functionality are highly anticipated in the blockchain industry.\n\nWith interoperability being the key issue, Flare first had to integrate its network with the EVM. After that, it started using it to convert smart contracts written in higher language into something that computers could understand.\n\nAll of this allows the network to run the so-called Turing complete smart contracts. These are smart contracts that machines can execute on their own, with proper instructions.\n\nFlare Network Features\n\nThe Flare Network offers several key features, including being the first Turing-complete FBA network in the world, compatibility with the EVM, low transaction costs, increased scalability, and the elimination of dependency on the native token.\n\nOne of the network's solutions is tokenization, which enables the functionality of smart contracts on other blockchains, such as XRP, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Stellar. This allows for these coins to participate in DeFi protocols, the NFT sphere, and more.\n\nFinally, there is also the network\u2019s native token, Flare (FLR), formerly known as Spark. Thanks to Flare\u2019s collaboration with Ripple, XRP holders can obtain FLR tokens for free. They can then use it for paying transaction fees, and in doing so, protect it from attacks. If transactions were free, the network would not have protection from spam attacks featuring worthless transactions. Other than that, the token is also acceptable as collateral in dApps.\n\nPros and Cons of Flare Network\n\nFlare network has a number of positives, many of which were discussed above. However, it is worth remembering that it also has some negatives, which users should be aware of.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the positives. It is rich with features, as explained above. Apart from that, it can bring smart contract functionalities to blockchains that cannot use smart contracts. It is fully decentralized, and as such, it boasts a predictable, trustworthy governance system.\n\nThe project is also backed by multiple major and reputable crypto exchanges, including OKX. Reputable and reliable brokers such as eToro support it as well. And, finally, the project provides a lot of incentives to encourage users to become transaction validators. In fact, it aims to encourage users to take on an active role in any position within the network.\n\nOne potential downside of the project is its association with Ripple and XRP. XRP has been facing accusations of being an unregistered security for years. While such claims were mostly ignored, companies and partners started listening when the SEC made the same allegations. Ripple has been locked in a legal battle with the regulator for over two years now. Since the end is still not in sight, Ripple is uncertain and unreliable.\n\nFLR Token\n\nFLR is the native token of the Flare Network, and it is primarily used for payments, and transaction fees. However, it does have additional use cases, such as serving as collateral. Their ERC-20 variant, the Wrapped FLR (WFLR), further expands the list of use cases. For example, the FLR tokens in this form can be delegated to FTSO data providers. Alternatively, they are used for staking, governance, and alike.\n\nIf we are talking about the original FLR, it emerged with the genesis of Flare mainnet, on July 14, 2022. Then, only days ago, it saw its public token distribution event on January 9, 2023. At Genesis, the token\u2019s total supply was 100 billion FLR. 12 billion entered circulation after the token distribution event. The plan is to continue to release monthly installments for 36 consecutive months.\n\nThe tokens were distributed thanks to the OKX exchange, which airdropped FLR to XRP holders on its platform. The tokens, airdropped only days ago, are also available for spot trading on OKX. Apart from OKX, Bybit, and Binance participated as well.\n\nWhat Is FLARE (FLR)?\n\nFLARE (FLR), formerly known as SPARK, is the native cryptocurrency of the Flare Network. It comes as a new and unique form of programmable money, with two detachable votes. These are used to contribute through the governance process, and the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO).\n\nFLR token holders can consider themselves citizens of the Flare Network, which grants them the right to vote on various proposals or introduce new proposals for network improvements. Additionally, the token holders also have the ability to participate in a detachable vote for providing price data feeds using Flare oracles.\n\nOracles are technologies that collect off-chain data and bring it to the blockchain. From there, it is used by smart contracts for more accurate performance, as the data indicates when they should self-execute.\n\nWhat Is FXRP?\n\nOn the other hand, there is FXRP \u2014 a trustless representation of XRP on the Flare Network. Due to the ties between the two projects, XRP holders can use smart contracts to create and redeem XRP tokens. This allows them to keep using XRP, and benefit from all the advantages that Flare Network has to offer.\n\nFor this system to work, it relies on participants who put FLARE tokens as collateral. They benefit from participation by earning fees when FXRP gets created and redeemed.\n\nFLR Network Wallet\n\nThose interested in becoming FLR holders should know that the token is supported by a number of wallets. Some examples include OKX Wallet, MetaMask, Ledger, Bifrost Wallet, SafePal, Rabby Wallet, Copper.co, ElliPal, and others.\n\nThe safest wallets, as always, are cold storage or hardware wallets such as Ledger. However, online wallets are far more convenient for quick transfers of money.\n\nIs Flare Network Worth it?\n\nThe Flare Network holds a lot of potential due to its innovative technology. Its ability to offer a full range of features while maintaining full decentralization is quite remarkable. Additionally, the network is still relatively new, so everything it has accomplished so far is just the beginning.\n\nWhile its association with Ripple may be perceived as a liability by some, it's important to note that Ripple is still defending itself against the SEC. If it is successful in the case, the controversy may be quickly forgotten.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Flare Network works with not only Ripple, but also many other projects. Its potential contribution to the development of Web3 could be significant, so the project should not be dismissed lightly.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat Coins Are on the Flare Network?\n\nFlare Network is currently the home of FLARE (FLR). This is its native cryptocurrency, formerly known as Spark. However, additional coins may launch on the network in the future.\n\nHas the Flare Network Launched?\n\nYes, Flare Network has seen the launch of its mainnet in July 2022. Following that, the project also held its token distribution event. The tokens were airdropped to XRP holders.\n\nIs Flare a Blockchain?\n\nFlare is an EVM-based Layer 1 blockchain. It is fully decentralized, and it uses State Connector and FTSO protocols. Both are interoperability protocols where FTSO offers price and data feed, while State Connectors enables information.\n\nWho Owns Flare Network?\n\nFlare was founded by Hugo Phillion, Sean Rowan, and Nairi Usher. However, the network is decentralized, meaning that it has no owner, other than the community.\n\nHow To Invest in Flare Network?\n\nInvesting in Flare Network means purchasing FLARE (FLR) tokens. The tokens are available on several exchanges, including OKX. XRP holders also get to receive them in airdrops.\n\nIs Flare on Ethereum?\n\nFlare integrates with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. However, it launched its own mainnet last year, in 2022.\n\nHow To Buy 1 FLR Token?\n\nThe easiest way to buy FLR tokens is on exchanges like OKX, where it just got supported for spot trading. Previously, users had to use a more complex approach. However, that is no longer necessary."
