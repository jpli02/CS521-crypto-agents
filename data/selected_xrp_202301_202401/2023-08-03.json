The payment firm is already making strides in its partnerships in regulated places like the UK, Europe, Singapore, Dubai and the Middle East.\n\nRipple President sheds light on firm\u2019s plans for the US market\n\nRipple President, Monica Long, told CNBC in an interview that Ripple is ready to make its comeback in the US. This development comes after Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 ruling declaring partial victory for the payment remittance firm against the US SEC.\n\nAlso read: Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton considers XRP ruling the most significant non-fraud SEC enforcement action\n\nWhile there has been speculation of the ruling facing trouble after updates in the SEC v.

These jurisdictions have provided clear framework and guidance to the payment remittance firm, making operations and expansion relatively easier for Ripple.\n\nThe announcement is likely to act as a bullish catalyst for XRPLedger\u2019s native token XRP price.\n\nXRP price is in a slump, awaiting a catalyst for recovery\n\nXRP price has been in a consistent decline since its July 13 high of $0.9354 on Binance. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.6641. The altcoin is awaiting a bullish catalyst to trigger a recovery, after nearly 30% decline from $0.9354 to $0.6641.\n\nXRP price could recover if the token\u2019s adoption and utility increases, with a wider use case for the XRPLedger blockchain."

        "title": "Ripple's Global Strategy Post-Torres Ruling: Insights from President Monica Long - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "On 13 July 2023, a significant ruling was delivered in the ongoing SEC vs Ripple Labs lawsuit. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had accused Ripple Labs and its two senior executives, Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian A. Larsen, of unlawfully offering and selling securities. The case was presided over by Hon. Analisa Torres, a district judge at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision was a mixed bag, granting and denying summary judgment motions from the SEC and Ripple. The SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment concerning the Institutional Sales was given but denied for other matters. Conversely, Ripple\u2019s motion for summary judgment regarding the Programmatic Sales, the Other Distributions, and the sales made by Larsen and Garlinghouse was granted but denied concerning the Institutional Sales. The SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the aiding and abetting claim against Larsen and Garlinghouse was also denied.\n\nA key takeaway from the ruling was the judge\u2019s statement that XRP, as a digital token, does not embody the Howey requirements of an investment contract, suggesting that the court does not view XRP as a security.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Ripple President Monica Long talked about the firm\u2019s partial victory in court and the firm\u2019s growing presence around the world.\n\nLong expressed her satisfaction with the court\u2019s ruling, which she said provided much-needed clarity for Ripple\u2019s operations. The ruling has allowed Ripple to re-engage with the U.S. market, but Long also emphasized that much of Ripple\u2019s growth over the years has been outside the U.S., in regions where there is clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.\n\nLong highlighted the UK, Europe, Singapore, and Dubai as jurisdictions that have provided clear frameworks and rules for cryptocurrencies. These regions have seen significant growth in Ripple\u2019s business, particularly in the realm of payments.\n\nThe UK was singled out as a significant hub for fintech and a country where Ripple is looking to increase its investment. This is in line with the UK\u2019s ambition to become a crypto hub with specific regulations tailored to crypto companies. Ripple\u2019s presence in London has grown significantly over the years, with the office more than doubling in size.\n\nRipple also has a large customer base throughout Europe and the Middle East, with Dubai being another key office. In addition to Europe and the Middle East, Ripple has seen growth in Asia and Latin America. Long mentioned that Latin America, in particular, has been \u201cheating up\u201d for Ripple, with a key office located in Sao Paulo."

It captures top firms across Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America, showcasing the diversity and scale of the payment industry.\n\nCNBC collaborated with Statista, an independent research firm, to ensure transparency in the selection process. Over 1,500 firms were thoroughly analyzed across nine market segments. The key performance indicators were revenue, user numbers, and funding raise.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe final roster featured industry giants like Ripple and Paypal in the US, China\u2019s Tencent, and the UK\u2019s Revolut, alongside promising startups keen on shaping the future of financial services.\n\nIn particular, the digital payments industry, where Ripple was featured, is reportedly experiencing exponential growth, with its current valuation surpassing a staggering $54 trillion.\n\nAccording to the report, the competition in the digital payments market is intense, with numerous players vying for a piece of the lucrative pie. However, this environment has also allowed other industry participants to innovate and offer unique solutions.\n\nAmong the top 40 digital payments companies identified by Statista, notable contenders included Ripple, Paypal, and Stripe of the United States. Additionally, renowned payment firms in India, Nigeria, Indonesia, China, the UK, Sweden, and South Korea were featured in this category.\n\nMoreover, firms such as Klarna of Sweden and Afterpay of Australia were featured for their contributions to the \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d sector. Despite the challenges posed by fears of decreased consumer spending and rising inflation, these services have become a lifeline for many, offering flexible payment alternatives.\n\nRipple has continued to attract significant recognition from leading entities across multiple domains. Recall that Fortune Magazine recently ranked Ripple among the best workplaces, as The Crypto Basic reported."

        "content": "The blockchain firm, Ripple, pointed out that both the judgment protects institutions and retailers.\n\nRipple sent 800 million XRP to its escrow wallet.\n\nRipple [XRP] finally gave an in-depth response to the partial win it had against the U.S. SEC on 13 July. Although the firm expressed its gladness shortly after the ruling, its latest Q2 market report provides a lot of clarity on certain misconceptions about the case.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 XRPs worth today?\n\nWhile Ripple published the report on 31 July, it only went public on 2 August. According to Ripple, SEC\u2019s lawsuit against it was misguided and a \u201cquest for political power.\u201d\n\nClarifying misconceptions\n\nHowever, Ripple also addressed some misinterpretations of the judgment. According to the firm, XRP is not just security in some corners but in all areas. Accusing the SEC of being a propaganda merchant, Ripple said,\n\n\u201cThe statement that the same \u201cthing\u201d can be sold to buyer \u201cA\u201d as part of a simple buy/sell transaction and also sold to buyer \u201cB\u201d as part of an investment contract is a non-controversial statement of the law. What finds no basis in the law is the SEC\u2019s propaganda to the contrary.\u201d\n\nRipple also addressed some comments that pitched their tent with the notion that the judgment favored institutional investors over the retail cohort. The blockchain company explained that the sentiment was nowhere true saying that,\n\n\u201cConsumers need protection, but not all roads lead to the SEC. If the SEC\u2019s overreach has exposed a regulatory gap, that gap is not for a court to fill (and certainly not for the SEC to fill without legal authority).\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto wallet sleuth Whale Alert noted that Ripple once again locked 800 million XRP by sending it into an escrow wallet.\n\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 500,000,000 #XRP (349,458,791 USD) locked in escrow at Ripple Escrow wallethttps://t.co/Zqfyy9EAnr \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 1, 2023\n\nXPR locked again\n\nAs a rule of thumb, Ripple locks XRP occasionally to ensure that market there is a balance between supply and demand in the market. In the report, Ripple also mentioned its XRP balance on the ledger, and in escrow. The report shed light on its holdings:\n\n\u201cXRP that it currently has available in its wallets, and XRP that is subject to on-ledger escrow lockups that will be released each month over the next 42 months.\u201d\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also commented on the report. He noted that the SEC had once used the firm\u2019s transparency against it. But this time, the regulatory agency cannot do that.\n\nWe began these reports to voluntarily provide updates given our XRP holdings. Sadly, they were used against us in the SEC lawsuit \u2013 however, we remain steadfast in our commitment to transparency but I suspect they\u2019re going to look a bit different moving forward https://t.co/oANR6WCG09 \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) August 2, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ripple Profit Calculator\n\nLately, another judge handling the Terraforms Labs matter opined that the Ripple ruling was wrong. As of this writing, the sentiment around XRP was no more as optimistic as it was before.\n\nAs of this writing, XRP\u2019s 30-day performance was a 43.16% hike\u2014 a drawdown from the incredible rise when Judge Torres declared XRP a partial winner."

        "title": "The XRP ruling is no knockout punch against the SEC - Blockworks",
        "content": "The recent ruling in SEC v. Ripple Labs has been hailed as a huge step forward for the crypto sector.\n\nAnd in a way, it is.\n\nThe overarching highlight of Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 34-page ruling?\n\nShe held that Ripple Labs had not violated US securities laws, as it was selling XRP anonymously to the average digital exchange user. This presents a significant roadblock to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s drawn-out campaign to try regulating cryptocurrencies by judicial order and piecemeal actions.\n\nYes, XRP holders should be thrilled about finally owning and purchasing XRP tokens without strings attached. The ruling is already affecting the SEC\u2019s strategy in similar cases against players like Terra.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that today\u2019s emerging crypto projects are in the clear.\n\nA road map to regulation\n\nIn her decision, Judge Torres teed up two standards of review when assessing whether Ripple Labs sold unregistered securities: one for how it addressed XRP sales to sophisticated hedge funds and other institutional investors, and another for how it approached the everyday consumer investor who uses publicly-accessible crypto exchanges.\n\nIn the process, she found that while Ripple Labs did not sell unregistered securities to lay crypto traders, it did so when selling to sophisticated investors.\n\nJudge Torres based this distinction on the idea that everyday investors who purchased XRP from 2011 to 2020 on exchanges did not receive any investment promotional materials, direct communications or legal agreements from Ripple when they traded XRP. To the contrary, many of these traders would not have known if they had purchased their tokens from Ripple Labs based on how digital exchanges operate.\n\nIn contrast, she found that the institutional investors Ripple pitched relied on Ripple\u2019s token purchase contracts, marketing materials, and executive speeches and communications regarding Ripple\u2019s role in creating value for the XRP tokens. Because of these communications, Judge Torres found that Ripple\u2019s activities would have signaled to these sophisticated investors that it was presenting a \u201cspeculative value proposition\u201d in XRP tied to the success of Ripple Labs.\n\nThis kind of analytical dichotomy is nothing unusual; the SEC promulgated a similar analysis in its \u201cFramework for \u2018Investment Contract\u2019 Analysis of Digital Assets\u201d back in 2018.\n\nStill, it should place public-facing crypto projects on notice that they could still come up against sanctions depending on how they sell their tokens and market their offerings to different audiences.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Ratioing Gensler on Twitter is sadly crypto\u2019s most powerful protest\n\nFortunately for the crypto industry, the decision identifies several steps companies can take to assess whether their activities align with US securities regulations. Judge Torres, for example, found that Ripple\u2019s purchase contracts resembled investment contracts in how they incorporated lock-up provisions, resale restrictions, indemnification clauses and statements of purpose.\n\nThe company\u2019s market reports, and even brochures to potential investors, also presented XRP tokens and their performance as materially tied to the success of Ripple Labs. It also didn\u2019t help that the leadership of Ripple Labs touted on YouTube and Reddit on how by driving interest and certain capital investments in Ripple, the company could lift the price of XRP.\n\nAt this stage, the SEC could \u2014 and likely will \u2014 request the Second Circuit to revisit Judge Torres\u2019 decision. While not delivering everything the crypto industry had hoped for, the decision in Ripple does provide a road map out of the current legal uncertainty bedeviling the crypto industry.\n\nAndrew St. Laurent is a New York-based partner at Harris St. Laurent & Wechsler LLP.
