        "content": "Technical analyst CoinsKid has identified a potentially bullish signal for Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP, hinting at the possibility of reaching a new all-time high. The analyst\u2019s observations are gaining attention within the crypto community due to their track record of accurate predictions.\n\nDouble Bottom Formation Fuels Optimism\n\nCoinsKid highlights a pattern called a \u201cdouble bottom\u201d as the key factor behind XRP\u2019s potential surge. This pattern is often regarded as a reliable indicator by traders, suggesting an impending upward trend following a period of decline.\n\nFurthermore, the analyst points out the formation of an ascending triangle, adding additional weight to the optimistic outlook.\n\nRead Also: Google Bard Predicts State of XRP Price After Ripple\u2019s Legal Victory\n\nIn a broader context, CoinsKid emphasizes a fundamental trading principle: \u201cCompression leads to expansion.\u201d According to the analyst, the current constrained trading range is likely to lead to a significant price breakout in the near future.\n\nThis hypothesis aligns with XRP\u2019s recent performance, which has shown relative stability, trading at approximately $0.72 at the time of writing, marking a 2.4% increase in value.\n\n#xrp \u2013 breakout target new ATH.

SEC Ruling Boosts Confidence\n\nThe recent price rally of XRP coincides with a positive ruling in the Ripple v. SEC case, instilling confidence among investors and enthusiasts. Optimism regarding the token\u2019s future has surged as a result, contributing to the growing narrative of an increasingly active altcoin market. This uptick in altcoin activity potentially poses a challenge to Bitcoin\u2019s longstanding dominance in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nRead Also: Ex-Ripple Exec Says About 48 Billion XRP Held By Ripple Has No Impact on XRP Price, States Major Factors\n\nOther altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), have also experienced modest gains alongside XRP.

Swissblock, a reputable crypto data platform, reports that Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is showing signs of wavering, hinting at a potential ongoing upward trend for altcoins.\n\nWe are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 \u2014 TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023\n\n<\n\nWhile these bullish indicators provide grounds for enthusiasm among investors, it is essential to approach predictions with caution.

        "title": "Next XRP price levels to watch amid fading SEC win hype - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The value of XRP rallied after the court declared the token was not a security in the high-profile case between Ripple and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Since the gains, XRP has been unable to make significant progress toward the $1 mark, and market observers suggest the token might experience further drops before recovering.\n\nIn a TradingView post on July 28, a crypto analyst using the pseudonym Juicyho expressed skepticism about a rapid XRP surge. The analyst emphasized that the token might not experience a significant rally until it touches the crucial support level of $0.58, with the analyst noting that the hype from the court case might not have a considerable impact.\n\nThe analyst identified resistance levels to watch out for, pointing out levels $0.769, $0.785, and $0.98. Among these, $0.785 is considered the most critical resistance level, as indicated by the historical price action on the yearly time frame.\n\nXRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\n\u201c$0.785 is the real resistance because if you look at the yearly time frame, last year we just consolidated, but this year we did break the inside bar. Within the next 5 month, I would want to see xrp touch .58 cents, and it\u2019ll happen to use it as a support then we will break,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nHe laid out a potential scenario for XRP\u2019s price movement, expecting the token to test the $0.58 support level, use it as a springboard, and aim for a breakout above the $0.769 to $0.785 range. Should XRP break and sustain a value above $0.981, it would signal a significant shift in price dynamics, potentially leaving behind the current lower price range.\n\nImpact of SEC case\n\nIt is worth noting that despite XRP earning a partial victory in the SEC case, the matter remains a key driver in the valuation of the token. Notably, there is speculation that the SEC might appeal the decision.\n\nAs reported by Finbold, the XRP holder\u2019s attorney, John Deaton, suggested that an appeal in the matter cannot be considered a setback for Ripple, citing reasons such as the appeal\u2019s long time frame. This emerged after the SEC faulted the judge\u2019s decision, noting that she erred.\n\nAt the same time, Stuart Alderoty, the Chief Legal Officer of Ripple Labs, has expressed strong confidence in the Court of Appeal, reaffirming the District Court\u2019s ruling that XRP is not a security if the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to challenge the decision.\n\nIn general, as the SEC case remains in play, the focus is on how XRP will react to the matter.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nAs of press time, XRP was trading at $0.72, with gains of almost 2% in the last 24 hours. However, XRP is down almost 3% in the last seven days.\n\nXRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nElsewhere, XRP\u2019s technical analysis on TradingView has turned bullish for the one-day period. A summary of the gauges recommends \u2018buy\u2019 at 14, while moving averages are for \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 12. Oscillators are neutral, gauging at 8.\n\nXRP technical analysis.

        "title": "Can Ripple\u2019s XRP Hit $20,000 To Level Bitcoin (BTC)? Pundit Makes Bold Prediction With Interesting Insights - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Chad Steingraber predicts a scenario where XRP could become a reserve currency asset and banks create derivatives at XRP Ledger.\n\nThis could propel the XRP adoption at a global level where driving the XRP price to a long-term target of $20,000.\n\nPost the Ripple ruling earlier this month in mid-July, the native cryptocurrency XRP has been on investors\u2019 radar after more than 50% gains over the last 15 days. World\u2019s top crypto exchanges like Coinbase and others have relisted the XRP token thereby providing a massive boost for trading volumes and liquidity.\n\nInvestors and market analysts have started making wild predictions for the XRP price going ahead. Chad Steingraber, the Creative Director at Ghostpunch Games, has put forth a bold argument for the potential of XRP to reach an astonishing price point of $20,000.\n\nOf course, this price target seems far-fetched and fantasized at this point in time when the XRP price is trading just a quarter to a Dollar. Also, these are just mere speculations and there\u2019s no guarantee that these things will occur in the future.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read my theory from the future.. I think you should give it a thought. \ud83d\ude0e https://t.co/d7ysY5euXc \u2014 Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) July 25, 2023\n\nSteingraber outlines the three core principles that govern the valuation of an asset. Firstly, he emphasizes the timeless economic principle of \u201cSupply and Demand.\u201d Considering XRP\u2019s limited supply of fewer than 100 billion coins, scarcity could exert significant upward pressure on prices if demand surges.\n\nSecondly, drawing an analogy from the real estate realm, he explores the concept of \u201cMarket Appreciation.\u201d As assets appreciate in value over time, the overall market value increases, even if the actual money injection remains constrained.\n\nLastly, he directs attention to the concept of \u201cLimited Assets,\u201d underscoring the value ascribed to assets like the Mona Lisa due to their uniqueness and societal significance.\n\nRipple XRP ODL Solution\n\nSteingraber highlights XRP\u2019s limited supply and deflationary mechanism due to burning small portions during transactions, influencing its price. XRP\u2019s market cap stands at $37.7 billion, up from $18 billion. However, it doesn\u2019t represent the actual investment, only the current value.\n\nFurthermore, Steingraber also talked about Ripple\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution. Ripple\u2019s ODL service targets small banks and money transmitters, not major institutions like Bank of America, Chase, or Wells Fargo, which require more privacy for their large transfers.\n\nAccording to him, banks need privacy for their internal ledger transactions, and XRP was never meant for public retail trading. Instead, he envisions banks creating private XRP ledgers and issuing their derivatives, similar to central banks holding gold as a backing asset.\n\nIn this scenario, XRP could become a reserve currency asset, with banks creating their derivatives on the XRP Ledger. For example, Bank of America could issue \u201cBOAcoin\u201d on XRPL, using XRP as a reserve asset to back it up.\n\nInternal transactions between banks and Institutional Grade Liquidity Providers (IGLPs) would depend on XRP to facilitate exchanges between these private coins. This private mass adoption of XRP would help achieve the $20,000 goal.\n\nIn this context, XRP\u2019s value would be linked to its crucial role in enabling cross-border transfers for major financial institutions, making it an essential and highly sought-after asset. Large banking corporations and other financial players could leverage this asset for their operations."

        "content": "Fubon Bank, a financial institution headquartered in Hong Kong, has unveiled its plans to initiate a real estate tokenization program in partnership with Ripple, a US-based fintech company.\n\nThe project, slated for the third quarter, aims to exploit the advantages of digital currencies and blockchain technology to streamline property transactions and lending processes.\n\nLeveraging Blockchain for Efficiencies in Property Transactions\n\nAccording to the report, as part of the pilot project, Fubon Bank will harness the Ripple Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform to tokenize properties, allowing the issuance of loans using digital Hong Kong dollars. The integration of blockchain technology will enhance security, transparency, and efficiency in property transactions while accelerating the loan issuance process using digital Hong Kong dollars.\n\nRead Also: Get Ready for More CBDCs: Ripple Senior Advisor Says More Announcements Coming Soon\n\nFubon Bank\u2019s initial focus in the testing phase will be on existing customers who may qualify for additional mortgage loans. Through the collaboration with Ripple, the bank will tokenize the collateral and offer eHKD loans to customers, employing a 1:1 exchange rate between Hong Kong dollars and the test digital currency.\n\nCustomers will have access to loan information and relevant data through Fubon\u2019s dedicated eHKD electronic wallet, which will provide real-time details such as loan-to-value ratios, stress tests, and property values.\n\nWe are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 \u2014 TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023\n\nAligning Ripple\u2019s CBDC Platform with XRP Ledger Technology\n\nEric Hsu, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of Fubon Bank, emphasized that the use of Ripple\u2019s CBDC platform, which incorporates digital Hong Kong dollars and tokenized real estate, aligns with the technology utilized in the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This technology operates on a secure and private ledger system.\n\nRipple has been actively engaged in numerous CBDC projects globally and is collaborating with several central banks, including trials of digital currencies for retail, cross-border, and wholesale payments in Bhutan. Additionally, Ripple is collaborating with the Palauan government on a US dollar-backed stablecoin.\n\nHsu further highlighted the maturity of Hong Kong\u2019s payment ecosystem, which already includes popular methods like FPS (Faster Payment System) and Octopus cards, making it conducive to the adoption of digital Hong Kong dollars.\n\nStarting with loan issuance was a strategic choice to drive the adoption of eHKD. As customers receiving digital Hong Kong dollar loans can utilize them for property purchases, investments, and other transactions, they will be encouraged to use the digital currency.\n\nRead Also: Ripple\u2019s CBDC Proposed Solution Adopted in the 2022 G20 TechSprint CBDC Challenge: Details\n\n<\n\nExploring Future Use Cases and Incentives\n\nWhile the pilot program currently focuses on mortgage loans, Fubon Bank is exploring potential collaborations with property developers to expand the use cases for digital Hong Kong dollars. For instance, young homebuyers could involve their parents, who could leverage their existing properties to acquire digital Hong Kong dollars for purchasing real estate from developers.\n\nThe success of such applications hinges on the growth of the digital Hong Kong dollar ecosystem, and Fubon Bank is considering incentives like \u201creferral bonuses\u201d to incentivize customers to embrace the digital currency.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"
