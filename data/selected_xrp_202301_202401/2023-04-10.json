        "title": "The SEC Has Failed To Prove XRP Is a Security in Ripple Lawsuit, Says Attorney Jeremy Hogan - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "One crypto legal expert says the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not proven that XRP is a security in the regulator\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple Labs.\n\nIn a lengthy thread, attorney and XRP supporter Jeremy Hogan tells his 263,300 Twitter followers why he believes the SEC has so far failed to prove XRP is a security.\n\nThe SEC sued Ripple in late 2020 under allegations that the company sold XRP as an unregistered security.\n\n\u201cFirst, under the legislative definition of a security, XRP can only POSSIBLY fit under the definition of an \u2018investment contract.\u2019 It is not a stock or bond, etc\u2026 Even the SEC concedes this: \u2018investment contract.'\u201d\n\nHogan says the SEC has so far failed to prove that there was a contract of investment for investors in XRP, one of the key features of a security, according to the Howey Test.\n\n\u201cIn the Ripple case, the SEC has failed to argue that there was an implied or explicit contract of investment.\n\nInstead it argues that the purchase agreement is all that is required \u2013 and that is all it proves.\n\nBut that argument tears the \u2018investment\u2019 from the \u2018contract\u2019\u2026\n\nAs a simple purchase, without more, cannot be an \u2018investment contract,\u2019 it is just an investment (like buying an ounce of gold) as there is no obligation for Ripple to do anything except transfer the asset.\u201d\n\nHogan says that securities laws were not created to prevent investors from making bad decisions, but to require that companies make certain disclosures regarding the contract that the purchaser is entering.\n\nThe lawyer adds,\n\n\u201cThe issue is NOT whether Ripple used money from the sale of XRP to fund its business.\n\nThe issue is whether the SEC has proven that there was either an implied or explicit \u201ccontract\u201d between Ripple and XRP purchasers relating to their \u2018investment.\u2019\n\nThere was no such contract.\u201d\n\nXRP is worth $0.50 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Schwartz says XRPL-based tokens offer more benefits to XRP.\n\nIn a tweet today, Ripple CTO David Schwartz highlighted some major benefits XRPL-based tokens give to XRP.\n\nHis response comes after crypto journalist Zach Rector asked the community whether XRPL-based tokens \u201cback\u201d the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, XRP. According to Rector, \u201cback\u201d is a form of financial or material support these tokens give XRP.\n\nQuestion for the #XRPLCommunity Do XRPL Tokens \u201cback\u201d XRP? Consider the definition of \u201cback\u201d used as a verb is the following\u2026 Give financial, material or moral support to. Let me know what you think! ? #XRP \u2014 Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) April 9, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe question attracted the interest of many XRP enthusiasts, who flooded the comment section to give their opinion. Responding to the question, an XRP supporter with the Twitter username @rippletinNZ said tokens built on the XRP Ledger do not \u201cback\u201d XRP.\n\nThe user said these XRPL-based tokens only offer \u201ca single benefit\u201d to XRP, which involves using the sixth-largest crypto for fees. He added that both XRPL-based tokens and XRP are after the same goal- investors\u2019 funds.\n\nThey don\u2019t back XRP. They are in direct competition to XRP. The single benefit they give to XRP is that they have to use XRP for fees, which are negligible. Both XRP and the XRPL token are after the same thing. Your dollar. \u2014 rippleitin.nz (@rippleitinNZ) April 9, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n@rippletinNZ\u2019s comments seemed to be the opinion of some XRP enthusiasts, as the comment has gotten 44 likes at press time.\n\nRipple CTO Thinks Otherwise\n\nHowever, Schwartz does not share the same opinion. Per Schwartz, these XRPL-based tokens offer more benefits to XRP than what was highlighted by @rippletinNZ.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite the only benefit,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Schwartz, these tokens help to boost XRP liquidity because of the auto-bridging feature and the fact that the coin has no issuer other than people holding the asset class.\n\n\u201cThey tend to increase the liquidity of XRP both because of auto-bridging and because of XRP\u2019s position as the only asset that has no issuer and that everyone holds,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\nFor context, the auto-bridging feature allows offers in the XRPL DEX to swap two XRPL-based tokens by potentially using XRP as an intermediary currency in a synthetic order book.\n\nFurthermore, Schwartz said XRPL-based tokens would benefit XRP through the Automated Market Maker (AMM). It is worth noting that the AMM functionality is part of the proposed XLS-30d extension to the XRPL protocol. Once implemented, AMM will provide liquidity to the XRPL\u2019s decentralized exchange.\n\nTheCryptoBasic reported that Ripple developers opened testing for the XRPL native AMM in November."

        "content": "Pan-African fintech, MFS Africa, has announced a partnership with Access Bank, Nigeria\u2019s largest bank, as it looks to expand remittance corridors for its AccessAfrica money transfers product.\n\nAccording to the bank, AccessAfrica is a payments product designed to simplify global payments by person-to-person (P2P), business-to-business (B2B), person-to-business (P2B), government-to-person (G2P) and any other payment activities/flows.\n\nThe product allows customers to initiate payments in the local currency of the initiating jurisdiction or US Dollars while the beneficiary receives a direct credit to his account or cash in the local currency or US Dollars.\n\nThe collaboration with MSF Africa will facilitate instant and affordable international money transfers for individuals and companies seeking to send financial aid or facilitate trade deals across borders. In addition, AccessAfrica clients will have the ability to receive payments from MFS Africa partners worldwide.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with MFS Africa and access to hundreds of millions of people in the new markets will help our customers pay and be paid, facilitating greater economic inclusion through trade as well as helping families across borders,\u201d said Robert Giles, Senior Banking Advisor, Retail, Access Bank.\n\nThe partnership comes few months after MFS Africa and Ripple, the blockchain solutions company behind the $XRP token, announced a partnership that would see Ripple\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution be available on the continent. According to Ripple, markets in Africa struggle to source liquidity and crypto solutions like ODL can buttress businesses that cannot source capital via traditional sources.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, Access Bank will be able to transfer remittances and make payments to MFS Africa\u2019s extensive network of:\n\n400 million mobile money wallets\n\n200 million bank accounts\n\nacross 35 African markets\n\nPeople and businesses from across the continent will find it it easier to receive payments from Nigeria, the proponents behind the deal indicate.\n\nAccess Bank itself serves 52 million customers across 700 branches and service outlets spread across three continents and 17 markets, the bank says. The two institutions believe they share the same driving spirit which is expanding financial inclusion for their customers, indiscriminately.\n\n\u201cPartnering with Access Bank, who shares this ethos, made complete sense. Uplifting the African continent through sustainable and accessible financial services has always been at the center of what we do at MFS Africa,\u201d said Dare Okoudjou, CEO at MFS Africa.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________"

        "title": "How A Minor Apple WebKit Tweak Can Send Ripples (Or Trigger Tsunamis) Across Marketing Tech - AdExchanger",
        "content": "Whenever the butterflies at Apple WebKit flap their wings, \u201cAd Tech Island\u201d feels the aftershocks.\n\nLast week, a small change to Apple\u2019s on-device tech to patrol third-party data collectors sent some mobile and online advertising practitioners into a tizzy over the loss of another sliver of data transparency.\n\nThey also fret because Apple continues to stake its claim over more of the territory that tech companies thought would be safely under the control of app and website publishers.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nLong story short, the Apple WebKit team, which operates the codebase for the Safari browser, adopted a change (first suggested late last year) to treat A/AAA records as a potential third-party data collection vehicle, in addition to CNAME records.\n\nOh, that didn\u2019t explain anything?\n\nTo clarify, a CNAME record is used when one business routes different servers and domains it controls to a host name. The A record maps a domain to the host IP address.\n\nSay ExampleBrand.com has an IP address 123.456.7.8. The A record maps to the IP number, while the CNAME maps to \u201cExampleBrand,\u201d (aka, the host name) which implies first-party control but also authorization.\n\nExampleBrand\u2019s signup process may route someone to ExampleBrand.com/emailauth to confirm an account. For that purpose ExampleBrand could work with an email data vendor that operates behind a CNAME record. Lots of enterprise IT tech and financial tech sits behind a CNAME.\n\nWebKit\u2019s privacy tech scrutinizes CNAME records to determine if the true host IP address is used and, if not, Safari caps the first-party cookie to a seven-day window. This delineates the true host brand from its vendor businesses.\n\nNow, WebKit will do the same with A/AAA records, which otherwise might be used \u201cto cloak third-party requests as first party and subsequently store cookies in the first-party context,\u201d according to the WebKit update doc on GitHub submitted last October by Apple engineer Wenson Hsieh.\n\nThe fallout\n\nThis latest Webkit tweak will primarily affect server-side data and analytics businesses, which act as proxies.\n\nIn other words, companies like Adobe, Segment and Amplitude are being downgraded to third parties, according to Jonathan Mendez, an ad tech and martech veteran who spotted the update.\n\nThis type of vendor will have a mere seven-day window, not just for advertising attribution but for basic functions, such as accurately tracking monthly visitors and recognizing logged-in users.\n\nBig advertising and analytics platforms are expanding their offerings to offer full-funnel solutions, to avoid including other vendors. With WebKit\u2019s new update, those platforms must own the web-hosting service, too, or data will be restricted for Safari users.\n\n\u201cEach thinks they are the real first party and are most likely building their own ID architectures that will compete and dominate advertising over the next five years,\u201d Mendez told AdExchanger in an email.\n\nBut it\u2019s not difficult for Apple to justify its change.\n\nAfter all, Adobe, Segment, Google, et al. are third parties, so being treated as third-party data collectors is hardly draconian.\n\nThe recent change is a good one as an Apple shareholder, said Mark Donatelli, co-founder of the marketing and analytics consultancy Cimply. Although, it makes life more difficult as a marketing and measurement consultant.\n\nApple\u2019s privacy policies were a knockdown blow to Facebook in 2021 and 2022. Apple then started to invest more in its advertising and mobile attribution.\n\nThis WebKit update goes to straight to the heart of Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics (GA), Donatelli said.\n\nAnd so, if the pattern holds, we should expect the launch of \u201cApple Analytics\u201d in the next year or two.\n\nNeed more proof? Apple bought Beats, then an outlier Bluetooth-only headphone maker, in 2014. Eighteen months later, Apple began removing the headphone jack from new devices.\n\nThe reality, Donatelli said, is that the number of \u201csurface areas\u201d for outside tech to understand audiences or even their own clients\u2019 customers are shrinking as Apple and Google bake privacy tech into their devices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving to a world where there are proprietary boxes you hold in your hand that are tied to a cloud account identity,\u201d Donatelli said. \u201cYou\u2019re either team Apple or you\u2019re team Google in terms of who manages your digital self.\u201d\n\nPrivacy means no transparency\n\nStill, why all the fuss, considering that the A/AAA change is a relatively minor update to a rule Apple has had for years? Which is that no third parties can be cloaked behind a first-party IP host account.\n\nBecause, although the change \u201cisn\u2019t that huge,\u201d CafeMedia Chief Strategy Officer Paul Bannister told AdExchanger in a written exchange, the overall policy is a setback for user experience development on the web. \u201cIt really restricts the capabilities of any sort of client-side analytics like GA, which severely limits sites\u2019 ability to actually improve their services.\u201d\n\nThe frustration by vendor practitioners is that Apple is wading into first-party data territory and making important changes to the ecosystem with no concern, foresight or seeming awareness that its policies are picking winners and loser.\n\nCloudflare, for instance, is a beneficiary here, Mendez said. If Cloudflare launches ad analytics, it would be cloaked as a first-party web hosting service.\n\nShopify, too, is a beneficiary, since it operates the servers, the site hosting and other services, which will be effectively cloaked. A merchant that doesn\u2019t go all-in in Shopify, but uses Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento), for example, would have a seven-day window to recognize customers on Safari.\n\nApple\u2019s silence also rankles.\n\nWhen Google\u2019s Chromium team changes the Chrome source code, it happens under intense scrutiny and amid debate. Why? If a sudden change to Chrome\u2019s data collection policies will have far-reaching effects for martech or ad tech companies, it could set off antitrust alarm bells based on nothing more than the fact that Google caught vendors by surprise.\n\nBut with Apple, it\u2019s a very different dynamic. There was no heads up or feedback requested during the testing process. There is no blog post about the WebKit update or mechanism to propose valid first-party data and customer experience use cases.\n\nMakes you wonder what other changes are quietly percolating.\n\n\u201cIt was interesting that a change of this magnitude happened so under the radar,\u201d Mendez said. \u201cThere are probably changes we\u2019re not even aware of.\u201d"
