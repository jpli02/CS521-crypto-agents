        "title": "Ripples Reigns as Ruffian 23 Volvo Dun Laoghaire Regatta Champion - Afloat",
        "content": "Volvo Dun Laoghaire Regatta\n\nFrom the Baily lighthouse to Dalkey island, the bay accommodates six separate courses for 21 different classes racing every two years for the Dun Laoghaire Regatta.\n\nIn assembling its record-breaking armada, Volvo Dun Laoghaire regatta (VDLR) became, at its second staging, not only the country's biggest sailing event, with 3,500 sailors competing, but also one of Ireland's largest participant sporting events.\n\nOne of the reasons for this, ironically, is that competitors across Europe have become jaded by well-worn venue claims attempting to replicate Cowes and Cork Week.'Never mind the quality, feel the width' has been a criticism of modern-day regattas where organisers mistakenly focus on being the biggest to be the best. Dun Laoghaire, with its local fleet of 300 boats, never set out to be the biggest. Its priority focussed instead on quality racing even after it got off to a spectacularly wrong start when the event was becalmed for four days at its first attempt.\n\nThe idea to rekindle a combined Dublin bay event resurfaced after an absence of almost 40 years, mostly because of the persistence of a passionate race officer Brian Craig who believed that Dun Laoghaire could become the Cowes of the Irish Sea if the town and the local clubs worked together. Although fickle winds conspired against him in 2005, the support of all four Dun Laoghaire waterfront yacht clubs since then (made up of Dun Laoghaire Motor YC, National YC, Royal Irish YC and Royal St GYC), in association with the two racing clubs of Dublin Bay SC and Royal Alfred YC, gave him the momentum to carry on.\n\nThere is no doubt that sailors have also responded with their support from all four coasts. Running for four days, the regatta is (after the large mini-marathons) the single most significant participant sports event in the country, requiring the services of 280 volunteers on and off the water, as well as top international race officers and an international jury, to resolve racing disputes representing five countries. A flotilla of 25 boats regularly races from the Royal Dee near Liverpool to Dublin for the Lyver Trophy to coincide with the event. The race also doubles as a RORC qualifying race for the Fastnet.\n\nSailors from the Ribble, Mersey, the Menai Straits, Anglesey, Cardigan Bay and the Isle of Man have to travel three times the distance to the Solent as they do to Dublin Bay. This, claims Craig, is one of the major selling points of the Irish event and explains the range of entries from marinas as far away as Yorkshire's Whitby YC and the Isle of Wight.\n\nNo other regatta in the Irish Sea area can claim to have such a reach. Dublin Bay Weeks such as this petered out in the 1960s, and it has taken almost four decades for the waterfront clubs to come together to produce a spectacle on and off the water to rival Cowes.\"The fact that we are getting such numbers means it is inevitable that it is compared with Cowes,\" said Craig. However, there the comparison ends.\"We're doing our own thing here. Dun Laoghaire is unique, and we are making an extraordinary effort to welcome visitors from abroad,\" he added. The busiest shipping lane in the country \u2013 across the bay to Dublin port \u2013 closes temporarily to facilitate the regatta and the placing of six separate courses each day.\n\nA fleet total of this size represents something of an unknown quantity on the bay as it is more than double the size of any other regatta ever held there.\n\nVolvo Dun Laoghaire Regatta FAQs\n\n\u00a9Afloat 2020"

        "content": "Disclaimer The CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency community price estimate is based only on the votes of its users. Estimates do not guarantee end-of-month prices.\n\nThe value of XRP has recently faced bearish sentiments, resulting in a loss of the crucial $0.50 support level. This decline can be attributed to the overall market conditions, with XRP remaining in the spotlight due to the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nGiven the legal dispute and the high stakes involved, XRP\u2019s price has become a topic of speculation in the broader cryptocurrency market, with market players offering different possible scenarios.\n\nFor instance, on the cryptocurrency monitoring platform CoinMarketCap, members of the XRP community anticipate that the token will end in July 2023 with a slightly positive performance compared to its current valuation. At the time of writing, with 519 votes, community members project that XRP is likely to trade at an average price of $0.4866 on July 31, representing a gain of over 3% from the current price.\n\nThe community also expects the bullish momentum to persist in the coming months. By the end of August, with 326 votes, members project a gain of over 5% for XRP, reaching a potential price of $0.49. Additionally, 203 members anticipate a resurgence to the $0.50 position, with XRP trading at $0.5628, reflecting gains of nearly 20% from the current price.\n\nCoinMarketCap community\u2019s XRP price prediction for July 31. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nNotably, the community members have an average historical accuracy of 91.7% over six-month. The highest accuracy rate, reaching 99.06%, was recorded in April 2023.\n\nCoinMarketCap community\u2019s XRP price estimation accuracy over the past 6 months. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.47, showing consolidation of the asset in recent days with gains of less than 0.5% in the last 24 hours. However, on the weekly chart, XRP has experienced a decline of over 2%.\n\nXRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, the one-day technical analysis retrieved from TradingView indicates predominantly bearish signals for XRP. The sentiment summary is at a \u2018sell\u2019 rating of 13, with moving averages suggesting a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 11. Oscillators also indicate a \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at 2.\n\nXRP technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite the bearish outlook, on-chain data aggregator Santiment on July 7 indicated that XRP and ADA are likely to rebound following the recent market sell-off. The increased selling pressure and lower prices of XRP and ADA have created favorable conditions for potential price recovery, according to Santiment.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Top cap #crypto assets are being traded at a loss after the high profit taking last week, lending to the price drop we've seen. $XRP and $ADA are seeing a particularly high amount of sells at lower prices, making the chances of bounces increase. https://t.co/Ntt3HoC52S pic.twitter.com/z5BatBNlKe \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 7, 2023\n\nXRP price catalysts\n\nCurrently, the ongoing legal case between Ripple and the SEC remains the primary catalyst influencing the price of XRP. The SEC has sued Ripple, alleging the sale of unregistered securities.\n\nIn this context, a favorable outcome for Ripple is seen as a bullish sentiment for XRP, while an unfavorable outcome has the opposite effect. Despite the potential repercussions of the case, XRP has demonstrated resilience and emerged as the third most traded cryptocurrency in Q2 2023.\n\nAs the community awaits the summary judgment date, various scenarios are being considered by the involved parties. For instance, Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton believes that a victory for the SEC would not benefit XRP holders, potentially leading to a prolonged unresolved status quo lasting two to five years.\n\nAlternatively, if Ripple appeals the case to the Supreme Court, the lawsuit could extend by another two to five years. Nonetheless, Deaton is confident that Ripple would prevail in this scenario.\n\nRead also: How to Buy XRP in 2 Minutes\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nThe cryptocurrency world is known for its innovation and constant evolution, with investors constantly seeking the next opportunity that promises substantial growth. Amid Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) experiencing a decline in value, InQubeta (QUBE) has emerged as a viable investment opportunity. InQubeta has quickly become a force to be reckoned with as it positions itself as the catalyst for groundbreaking advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmidst the intensifying race for the next breakthrough in the crypto space, InQubeta could be seen as the best new crypto to invest in owing to its distinctive investment approach. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, focusing on financial transactions, InQubeta builds the link between cutting-edge AI startups and investors for a better ecosystem. InQubeta has experienced extraordinary growth in presale as investors became aware of its potential for high profits.\n\nThis article explores InQubeta and its purchase growth while considering Cardano and Ripple\u2019s price falls.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s (QUBE) Unique Investment Strategy Shakes The Crypto Space\n\nThe emergence of InQubeta as the world\u2019s first crypto crowdfunding platform is a significant achievement in the crypto space. InQubeta, known for exceptional application, adopts a cutting-edge strategy to tackle the inefficient and inaccessible challenges faced in the traditional investment of startups. InQubeta harnesses the power of Smart Chain technology within the Ethereum blockchain network to establish a robust and transparent platform, benefiting AI startups and investors equally.\n\nThe QUBE token, the in-house currency within the InQubeta ecosystem, allows investors to invest in any AI startup by purchasing their NFTs. Every startup that wishes to raise funds from the platform must mint their NFTs into an investment opportunity. Each NFT is designed to represent equity in the startups.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s NFT Marketplace is designed to ensure that investors can easily browse through it to purchase cool NFTs, as the platform offers fractional investment to suit investors\u2019 budgets. Aside from its exceptional utility in the crypto space, InQubeta also employs the deflationary mechanism, with 2% of all transactions to be sent to a burn wallet. This is expected to create a scarcity of QUBE tokens with a corresponding price increase.\n\nThe market\u2019s response to InQubeta\u2019s mission has been overwhelming, with investors flocking to the presale to secure their share of the QUBE token. InQubeta\u2019s presale has grown substantially, with over 126 million QUBE tokens sold and almost $850k raised in the first stage. As the presale progresses, the excitement is rising, signaling a potential paradigm shift in cryptocurrency.\n\nCardano (ADA) Seeks To Recover Soon.\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform that provides a more secure and sustainable infrastructure for developing decentralized applications and smart contracts. It was founded by Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, and the platform utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm called Ouroboros to secure the platform.\n\nThe recent price fall witnessed by Cardano has been attributed to a lawsuit filed by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors and traders in ADA need to keep an eye on the market as Cardano may soon surge in price depending on the result of the lawsuit.\n\nRipple (XRP) Struggles Over Lawsuit\n\nThe Ripple network was founded in 2021 as a permissionless and decentralized platform. The platform serves as a payment protocol to facilitate fast and low-cost international money transfers and improve the efficiency of cross-border transactions. In the Ripple ecosystem, XRP is used for payment, tokenization, and DeFi, among other use cases.\n\nDespite the vast application of XRP, the current price fall has become a serious concern among its investors. The bearish state of Ripple has been tied to the lawsuit by the US SEC against Ripple Labs, alleging that XRP was an unregistered security. Nevertheless, experts believe XRP can rise above its all-time high of $3.84.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is amid an exhilarating shift, and InQubeta is at the forefront, poised to shake the industry. Amid the dwindling state of Cardano and Ripple, InQubeta is supporting AI startups and building a sustainable platform that benefits all users. Investors seeking the next big thing in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies see QUBE as the best new crypto to invest in as it offers substantial returns.\n\nKeywords: InQubeta, QUBE, Cardano, ADA Ripple XRP, best new crypto to invest in, cool NFTs\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."

        "title": "Op-ed: Gun violence threatens the local economy and Chicago's future - Chicago Tribune",
        "content": "Gun violence is a uniquely American problem. Last year, a total of 695 people \u2014 parents, children, siblings, spouses, neighbors and friends \u2014 were slain in Chicago. The vast majority were killed with guns. London, a city with more than three times as many people, had 109 homicides last year, and earlier this year, the London mayor told the BBC that the \u201clevel of violence remains too high.\u201d\n\nThe harms of gun violence on Chicago\u2019s families and neighborhoods persist in part because of the harm shootings impose on the local economy. While there\u2019s been a lot of attention recently given to the problem of shoplifting, the data clearly shows that gun violence poses a far greater threat to Chicago\u2019s desirability as a place to live, work and run a business. That drains the city of people, institutions and tax revenue that could have helped solve the problem.\n\nGun violence poses a particular challenge to Chicago because our city\u2019s economic fundamentals have changed. Chicago originally became an economic powerhouse because of its location. Some 150 years ago when the national economy relied on boats and trains to transport goods, proximity to the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River made Chicago the center of everything.\n\nBetween 1840 and 1910, the city grew from a village of 4,000 people to the nation\u2019s second largest city. But today, trucks and the internet move economic value across the country. Factories have closed, farms are largely mechanized, and most jobs are in the service sector and can increasingly be performed anywhere. People are increasingly voting with their feet to flee the Rust Belt for the South and West. People and businesses are less tied to any one place than ever before.\n\nGun violence threatens to accelerate this trend and harm Chicago\u2019s local economy in part by making it harder for businesses to attract and retain employees. A lot of attention has gone to the relocation decisions of big downtown companies like Boeing, Caterpillar and Citadel, but this is an issue for businesses of all sizes all across the city. For example, after a daytime shooting here in Hyde Park shattered the storefront glass of our local ice cream shop, Kilwin\u2019s, every one of the store\u2019s staff members requested a transfer to another location.\n\nOne small-business owner in Pilsen said she\u2019s considering moving out of the city after the store was robbed and someone was carjacked nearby. As she told a reporter, \u201cWe can\u2019t live like this. The city has become \u2014 I would even say, Gotham City is a little bit better, because you have Batman.\u201d\n\nAnother way gun violence hurts the local economy is by driving away customers. Our University of Chicago colleague Steve Levitt and University of California at San Diego economist Julie Cullen estimate that every homicide reduces a city\u2019s net population by 70 people. This helps explain why a city of 3.6 million people in 1950 has lost nearly a million residents in the years since.\n\nGun violence disproportionately drives population flight in those South and West Side neighborhoods where economic development is most needed. For example, between 2000 and 2020, neighborhoods with high rates of gun violence like Austin and Englewood lost 32% and 44% of their Black communities, respectively, due in large part to people\u2019s concerns about safety. It\u2019s hard to bring businesses in when customers are moving out.\n\nGun violence also makes it hard to strengthen the other key factor that residents and businesses regularly mention as a key driver of where they locate: public education. Growing up in a neighborhood where shootings are common makes it much harder for children to learn in school and also creates trauma and related challenges for children and their parents that make it harder in all sorts of ways to navigate daily life more generally.\n\nThe result of this population flight is fewer resources to help the city fund the sort of solutions that are urgently needed. By some estimates, Cook County is losing more than $1 billion a year in property taxes from vacant or abandoned property. A loss in workers, customers and businesses also deprives Chicago of help covering the costs of operating the city that we have to pay regardless of how many people live here \u2014 economists call them \u201cfixed costs\u201d \u2014 like the unfunded pension debt the city has accumulated of more than $35 billion. That comes out to tens of thousands of dollars per city resident. The more people leave Chicago, the higher the debt burden for everyone who\u2019s still here. It\u2019s even harder to attract and retain people in a city where taxes are going up just to pay off past debt rather than improve current city services.\n\nThe long-term fate of Chicago depends on our ability to confront the very real threat that gun violence poses of potentially pushing the city into a vicious spiral of population loss, business loss and economic decline. The passing of our wonderful friend and local civic leader (and former University of Chicago trustee) Jim Crown is a great loss to the city as we attempt to reach consensus on solutions and begin to make progress.\n\nBut for the future of our city, we must come together to do just that. Failure is not an option.\n\nRoseanna Ander is the founding executive director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab.
