        "title": "Ripple CTO's Cryptic Tweet Sparks Speculation in XRP Space - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently posted a cryptic tweet consisting of a right angle with a downward zigzag arrow, leaving the XRP community speculating about its meaning. On January 7, 2024, Schwartz tweeted the symbol without a caption. Hours later, he posted it again with a question mark.\n\n\u237c \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 7, 2024\n\nIn a poll, Schwartz offered four options \u2013 three being the symbol in different forms, and one reading \u201cJust show\u201d \u2013 which garnered 72.3% of votes. Schwartz has yet to explain the tweet.\n\nHowever, XRP enthusiasts have now theorised what the symbol foreshadows. Some believe a major Ripple or XRP announcement approaches. Influencer XRP Cryptowolf wonders if it hints at something XRP-related.\n\nOne user thinks Schwartz used blissymbols, or semantography, to convey a message. Though the precise meaning is unclear, the user says a zigzag represents lightning in this language, while a right angle symbolizes an arm. Therefore, the tweet may signal a breakthrough.\n\nAfter an excellent 2023 for Ripple and XRP, hopes are high for 2024. While the cryptic tweet\u2019s interpretation remains uncertain, the XRP community keeps their fingers crossed for positive developments this year.\n\nThe tweet has sparked intrigue and speculation within the Ripple and XRP community. All eagerly await Schwartz\u2019s eventual explanation of the symbol\u2019s significance, presuming it indicates noteworthy news ahead for the company and cryptocurrency."

        "title": "XRP Crashes 10% Weekly, How Long Can it Go? (Ripple Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Following an extended period of sideways consolidation, the price underwent an unforeseen impulsive cascade, breaching the lower boundary of the range.\n\nConsequently, the market appears to have transitioned into a phase of successive bearish movements, signaling prevailing negative sentiment.\n\nXRP Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nRipple Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nExamining the daily chart reveals that Ripple has decisively broken below its multi-month sideways consolidation range, experiencing a significant 22% cascade that triggered numerous sell-stop orders. This led to a substantial long-squeeze event, propelling the price below a critical support region encompassing the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, as well as the $0.57 static support range. This support range is pivotal, and a successful breach below it unmistakably signifies the dominance of bearish sentiment in the market.\n\nHowever, the price has retraced back to the breached level, potentially completing a pullback. If this pullback is confirmed, signifying a successful breakout, Ripple\u2019s price may undergo a mid-term downward trend toward the substantial $0.48 support region.\n\nNevertheless, there is a faint possibility that the recent breakout could be a false one, with the price retracing back above the breached range. If successful, the market might initiate a fresh surge, targeting the $0.7 resistance threshold.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer analysis of the 4-hour chart emphasizes an impulsive breach below a significant support region, spanning from the critical 0.5 ($0.61) to 0.618 ($0.58) levels of the Fibonacci retracement, aligning harmoniously with the lower boundary of the wedge.\n\nThe break below this crucial range indicates seller dominance in the market.\n\nHowever, the impulsive cascade found support at the crucial region of $0.51, along with the multi-month ascending trendline, where demand outweighed supply. As a result, an immediate reversal occurred, retracing the price toward the breached support region, now acting as a formidable resistance and potentially completing a pullback.\n\nNevertheless, Ripple appears to be confined within a significant range, defined by the resistance region marked by the critical 0.5 ($0.61) to 0.618 ($0.58) Fibonacci retracement levels and the crucial support of $0.51. Consequently, a mid-term consolidation stage within this essential range is expected for Ripple in the mid-term."

        "title": "Oldest Known Spiral Galaxy Seen With Pond-Like Ripples in Astronomical First - ScienceAlert",
        "content": "Astronomers have detected pond-like ripples across the gaseous disk of an ancient galaxy.\n\nWhat caused the ripples, and what do they tell us about the distant galaxy's formation and evolution? And whatever happened, how has it affected the galaxy and its main job: forming stars?\n\nThis discovery concerns the oldest known spiral galaxy. It's over 12 billion years old, and it's called BRI 1335-0417. As the oldest known spiral, it holds an important place in our study of how galaxies form and evolve.\n\nAccording to scientists, the ripples in the disk of BRI 1335-0417 reveal the galaxy's growth patterns. The observations show a vertically oscillating disk movement like ripples on a pond. It's the first time this phenomenon has been observed, and the ripples could help explain star formation in the galaxy.\n\nThe observations are part of new research published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The research is titled \"Detecting a disc bending wave in a barred-spiral galaxy at redshift 4.4.\" The lead author is Dr. Takafumi Tsukui, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA) at the Australian National University.\n\nBRI 1335-0417 is known for its rapid star formation rate. It forms stars much more prolifically than modern galaxies like the Milky Way. Some measurements show that it forms stars hundreds of times faster than our galaxy does. Somehow, gas is being transported and turned into stars more efficiently than in other galaxies.\n\nThe observations that revealed the ripples were taken with ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array. ALMA is especially powerful at observing gas and dust, which helped it see the ripples. The researchers say that the ripples are evidence of some sort of external influence, like interactions with another galaxy or possibly incoming gas. Both of those influences can trigger rapid star formation and could help explain why BRI 1335-0417 forms stars so quickly.\n\nBut ALMA found more than just ripples; it also found evidence of a central bar.\n\nBars in spiral galaxies can drive star formation by channelling gas from the arms into the galaxy's central region and fuelling the birth of stars there. The same process could also explain active galactic nuclei.\n\n\"The bar, 3.3 +/- 0.2 kiloparsecs long in radius and bridging the previously identified two-armed spiral, is evident in both [C-II] and [far infrared] images, driving the galaxy's rapid evolution by channelling gas towards the nucleus,\" the researchers write in their paper.\n\nBars in spiral galaxies are normal. One study showed that over one-quarter of all spiral galaxies have bars. Both the Milky Way and our closest neighbour the Andromeda galaxy are barred spirals. The bars may be temporary and decay over time, turning barred spiral galaxies into plainer spiral galaxies. Bars may only last about two billion years. They may be cyclical and form and decay repeatedly, which helps explain why we find so many of them.\n\nSome established astronomical thinking says that forming a bar is the final act in the evolution of a galaxy.\n\n\"The formation of a bar may be the final important act in the evolution of a spiral galaxy,\" said Kartik Sheth of the Spitzer Science Center when commenting on research in 2008.\n\n\"Galaxies are thought to build themselves up through mergers with other galaxies. After settling down, the only other dramatic way for galaxies to evolve is through the action of bars.\"\n\nBut astronomers have never found a bar in a galaxy this early in the Universe.\n\nIt suggests a different mechanism for how bars form. \"The bar identified in [C-II] and [far infrared] images of the gas-rich disc galaxy suggests a new perspective of early bar formation in high redshift gas-rich galaxies \u2013 a gravitationally unstable gas-rich disc creating a star-forming gaseous bar, rather than a stellar bar emerging from a pre-existing stellar disc,\" write the authors.\n\n\"This may explain the prevalent bar-like structures seen in FIR images of high-redshift submillimeter galaxies,\" the authors explain.\n\nFinding these ripples \u2013 and the bar \u2013 in this ancient galaxy is forcing a rethink. Normally, the gas disk in a galaxy like this is stable, so the ripples indicate something has happened to the disk recently.\n\nWhether it was an interaction with another galaxy or an interaction with a massive gas cloud is unknown. However, the conclusion seems natural to the authors. \"It is natural to suppose that such an interaction would also activate the high star formation activity,\" they write.\n\nAstronomers are certain that galaxies form and evolve through mergers with other galaxies and with massive gas clouds. These findings don't challenge the idea. But the observation of noticeable ripples gives researchers another window into how it all works.\n\nThis article was originally published by Universe Today.

        "title": "Do brain ripples boost emotional memory encoding? - News-Medical.Net",
        "content": "In a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers investigated whether post-encoding ripples improve emotional memory through amygdala-hippocampal memory restoration or stimulus retention in working-type memory. They also investigated whether either method improves stimulus similarities through post-encoding ripples.\n\nDuring memory consolidations, amygdala-hippocampal connections affect emotional memory through various processes, including neuromodulatory effects. Memory reinstatement during the post-encoding stage predicts memory performance later in life. Ripples are transient hippocampal oscillations linked with synchronous neuronal activity in the hippocampus and amygdala, crucial in binding memory traces and reactivating emotional memory.\n\nAbout the study\n\nIn the present study, researchers intended to determine whether ripple-regulated dynamic changes in the hippocampus and amygdala enhanced emotional memory.\n\nSeven human subjects participated in the study, which included intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings obtained from the hippocampus and amygdala while undertaking tests for encoding and discriminating emotional memory. The team provided the participants with stimuli and asked them to judge the valence as positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nIn the retrieval phase, participants were shown one of three stimuli categories: Repeats (same), Lure (marginally different), and Novel (stimuli not observed during encoding times) and asked to classify each one as old or new. The team defined memory discrimination as correctly categorizing repeat stimuli as old, novel stimuli as new, or lure stimuli as new.\n\nThe researchers investigated the relationship between post-encoding ripple rate (number of ripple occurrences per second), emotional content (stimulus-elicited arousal and valence), and accurate Lure discrimination after retrieval.\n\nThey also investigated whether stimulus similarities in post-encoding ripple periods may improve memory discrimination later. The researchers calculated stimulus similarities based on Spearman correlations between HFA power spectral vectors (PSVs) from the same trial for all encoding-response time bin combinations.\n\nThe researchers assessed post-encoding stimuli similarities for each location relative to the ripple peak to analyze the unique contributions of the hippocampus and amygdala to the phenomenon. They subsequently investigated the relationship between post-encoding stimulus similarities, stimulus-elicited arousal, and Lure discrimination. The researchers anticipated that the intervals of stimulus similarities in both structures occur concomitantly and follow a consistent temporal dynamic.\n\nResults\n\nThe team investigated intracranial recordings from the human amygdala and hippocampus to evaluate their impact on emotional memory encoding and discriminating. They confirmed behavioral findings of superior discriminate memory for stimulating stimuli using intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings in epileptic patients. Ripple event counts immediately following learning were related to stimuli-elicited arousal and subsequent discriminating accuracy.\n\nThe synchronized post-encoding stimuli similarities across the hippocampus and amygdala for post-encoding ripples predict subsequent memory discernment performance, with the stimulus similarities in the amygdala influencing the hippocampal stimulus similarity.\n\nMemory discrimination improved for emotional-type stimuli, with individuals correctly identifying repeat and new stimuli. The accuracy of memory discrimination was poorer for the Lure stimuli, indicating that picture similarity generated memory interference.\n\nStimulus-elicited arousal was linked to accurate lure discrimination, correlating with prior findings. Response durations did not show significant associations with the emotional valence of the stimuli. The Lure discrimination index (LDI) showed considerably higher values for the high-arousal-type stimuli, demonstrating the likelihood of high-arousal-type stimuli being classified as novel.\n\nPrecise lure discriminations were strongly related to stimulus arousal and resemblance but not valence. The team observed a strong relationship between similarity and arousal, with low similarity and high arousal-type stimuli yielding the most accurate Lure discrimination.\n\nPost-encoding-type ripples were associated with improved emotional stimulus discrimination, with higher post-encoding ripple rates associated with stimulus-elicited arousal, and they also predicted better Lure discrimination following retrieval but not with stimulus valence.\n\nThe study indicated that stimulus-elicited arousal and later accurate Lure discrimination were the primary impacts, with no significant interaction. Ripple likelihood was much higher during periods of low theta power, which is consistent with studies of ripple suppression during periods of robust theta oscillations.\n\nThe reactivation of various elements of stored stimuli was related to post-encoding and ripple-locked stimuli similarities in the hippocampus and amygdala, indicating that these areas play a crucial role in memory discrimination. The study discovered that stimulus similarity on trials without post-encoding ripples did not differ significantly according to stimulus arousal level or subsequent accurate Lure discrimination.\n\nConclusions\n\nOverall, the study findings showed that post-encoding ripples improve emotional memory, with higher ripple rates related to stimulus-elicited arousal and accurate stimulus identification. The findings indicated that ripples may selectively enhance salient events.\n\nThere was no significant relationship between encoding ripples and Lure discrimination accuracy, indicative of the mediation of retrieval and strengthening of stored representations, thus contributing to memory consolidation. Post-encoding sensory similarity aids memory consolidation, which peaks during ripples."
