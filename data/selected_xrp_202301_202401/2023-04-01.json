        "title": "Whale XRP Activity Increases As Ripple's Feud Ends With SEC - VOI English",
        "content": "JAKARTA - XRP is one of the oldest and most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. This currency was created by Ripple Labs as a fast, cheap, and secure cross-border payment solution. XRP serves as a bridge between various fiat currencies and other digital assets.\n\nHowever, XRP is also facing significant legal challenges from the US SEC, which accuses Ripple Labs of selling XRP as an unregistered securities. The lawsuit has negatively affected XRP prices and liquidity, and caused some crypto exchanges to suspend or remove XRP trading.\n\nNonetheless, XRP still has a loyal and strong fan base, which believes that this currency has great potential to become a global standard for payments. XRP supporters are also optimistic that Ripple Labs will be able to prove that XRP is not a security and resolve disputes with the US SEC peacefully.\n\nOne indicator of this optimism is the increasing activity of crypto \"whole\"s, namely investors or entities that have a large amount of XRP. Recent data show that crypto \"whale\" is increasing their ownership of XRP, even as other cryptocurrencies have decreased.\n\nThis shows that crypto \"whale\"s see opportunities to buy XRP at low prices and anticipate future price increases. In addition, crypto \"whale\" may also want to benefit from XRP token combustion features, which will reduce the number of supplies in circulation and increase the value of each coin.\n\nXRP is currently the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, after Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin. The price of XRP has risen more than 42 percent in the past month, hitting its highest level since May 2021. The trading volume of XRP has also increased significantly, reflecting the high interest of traders and investors.\n\nAccording to data provided by a large cryptocurrency tracker, WhaleAlert, more than 360 million XRP coins worth about US$192 million (equivalent to Rp2.8 trillion) have been transferred by \"whale\" in several transactions over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe biggest transaction recorded by the tracker was moving 100 million XRP coins worth 53.4 million US dollars (equivalent to Rp785 billion) to an unknown address. However, another \"whale\" was caught moving 95 million XRP coins worth 51.6 million US dollars (Rp773 billion).\n\nThe data shows that crypto \"whale\" has added ownership when the address added more than 146 million XRP worth US$78 million (Rp1.1 trillion) in the last 24 hours. The biggest additional transaction recorded by the tracker added 60.3 million XRP coins worth US$32.3 million (Rp484 billion) from the Binance crypto exchange.\n\nAccording to a Coingape report, it should be noted that as many as 94.4 million XRP coins worth 50.5 million US dollars (Rp757 billion) have been transferred from Binance to an unknown wallet when the crypto exchange faces legal problems from the CFTC.\n\nEven so, XRP still has challenges and opportunities ahead of it. The trial decision between Ripple Labs and the US SEC will greatly determine XRP's fate in the US and global markets.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

        "title": "Ripple (XRP) Token Tallies 14% Increase In Past Week \u2014 Here\u2019s Why | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "XRP, the cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, has experienced significant price growth in recent weeks, registering an increase of 14% in the last week alone. This marks an appreciation of over 40% for the asset in the last 30 days, positioning it as the cryptocurrency that has seen the highest increase in price across the entire market in the last seven days.\n\nAccording to the CoinMarketCap, XRP rose from $0.44 to $0.54 during this period, partly driven by increased trading on South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly Korbit and Bithumb, where XRP was the most traded crypto asset on the platforms in the last 24 hours. This positive trend has been linked to increased confidence from investors amid the backdrop of the current lawsuit with the SEC.\n\nRelated Reading: XRP Price Climbs 13% Following Settlement Rumors With SEC\n\nXRP Potential Classification As A Commodity Could Affect Ripple\u2019s SEC Lawsuit\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been embroiled in a legal battle with Ripple for over two years over whether XRP constitutes as an \u201cunregistered security.\u201d If XRP is accepted as a commodity, it could potentially undermine the SEC\u2019s case against Ripple.\n\nMarket specialist and TV host Jim Cramer noted the potential implications of XRP\u2019s classification as a commodity, stating that the SEC could lose the lawsuit it launched against Ripple more than two years ago.\n\nHowever, the optimism in the market for XRP was short-lived, as the cryptocurrency\u2019s rally stalled shortly after Cramer\u2019s comments. This prompted comments on social media that Ripple will not win the SEC lawsuit as his predictions often fail to come to pass.\n\nRelated Reading: XRP Profit Taking At Highest Since Aug. 2021 As Price Rises Another 17%\n\nWhile XRP has seen impressive growth in recent weeks, it\u2019s important to note that the cryptocurrency market as a whole remains highly volatile and susceptible to fluctuations. It is important to exercise caution and carefully consider the potential implications of various factors, including the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC.\n\nNonetheless, XRP\u2019s recent performance is a notable development within the cryptocurrency market. It will be interesting to see how it continues to perform in the coming weeks and months.\n\nCould Ripple Challenge Ethereum As The Leading Altcoin?\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has witnessed a continuous battle for dominance among the top digital currencies. Ripple (XRP), which was once considered an underdog in the crypto space, has emerged as a serious contender to Ethereum\u2019s position as the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nXRP\u2019s market capitalization is hovering around $100 billion at the time of writing, while Ethereum\u2019s market cap is around $300 billion. There\u2019s a growing expectation that a positive verdict could see a steep climb in the market cap of Ripple.\n\nXRP Price Analysis\n\nXRP is currently trading at $0.5094, with the token down 4.94% in the past 24 hours. This slight correction is in response to the overall crypto market, which is currently in the red zone. The next resistance level is $0.55, while support levels are $0.45 and $0.40, respectively.\n\nPlease note: Content is educational and should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Jude Bellingham: Arsenal reach major decision as Arteta stance causes Liverpool, West Ham ripple effects - TEAMtalk",
        "content": "Arsenal have reportedly reached a major decision on entering the transfer chance for Jude Bellingham as the race to sign the \u00a3120m-rated teenager reaches fever pitch.\n\nThe Borussia Dortmund midfielder is among one of the world\u2019s most sought-after stars right now. Having moved to the Bundesliga in summer 2020, he has taken his game on to new heights, establishing himself as one of the best in the business and a regular for his country.\n\nPlaying in a more advanced role than previous this season, he has 10 goals and five assists from 34 appearances so far.\n\nAnd with demand for his services higher than ever, Dortmund are understandably seek a huge \u00a3120m fee for the 19-year-old this summer.\n\nThat chase is seemingly being led by Liverpool, who are desperate to sign Bellingham as part of a midfield rebuild.\n\nCompetition though is tough with Manchester City, Manchester United and Real Madrid also sniffing around a potential deal.\n\nProviding the latest on the saga, we revealed earlier this week that Dortmund could look to blindside all his suitors with a shock move.\n\nOne team, though, who have only been mentioned as having an outside chance of signing Bellingham is Arsenal.\n\nBut with the Gunners seeking a new midfielder themselves this summer, some would argue they could be considered dark horses in the transfer chase.\n\nHowever, the Daily Telegraph now claims Arsenal have reached a decision on a possible move for Bellingham.\n\nAnd while the possibility of making a move for the 24-cap England man has been discussed, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has now decided against a move.\n\nREAD MORE ~ Exclusive: Edu in a rush to tie down Arsenal star Arteta loves as PSG lurk with mega-money offer\n\nArteta rules out Bellingham for two reasons\n\nPer their report, the Telegraph claims Arsenal will not join the hunt for Bellingham for two reasons.\n\nFirstly, Bellingham\u2019s transfer fee \u2013 likely to be well around \u00a3120m if there is a bidding war \u2013 is simply too great for Arsenal to match.\n\nFormer Arsenal scout Francis Cagigao revealed earlier this year that he had urged Arsenal to sign Bellingham when he was leaving Birmingham City. As for a move this summer, he admitted his fee is already beyond Arsenal\u2019s reach.\n\n\u201cI saw him for the first time when he was 16 years old,\u201d Cagigao told AS.\n\n\u201cI wanted to sign him for Arsenal, but he was already too expensive.\n\n\u201cHe is very good. What is clear is that if a club have paid that amount for Enzo [Fernandez], a club is also going to pay that for Bellingham.\u201d\n\nArsenal confidence at signing Declan Rice instead\n\nThe second reason behind Arsenal\u2019s stance not to move for Bellingham is that Arteta is instead ready to go all in on a summer move instead for Declan Rice.\n\nThe West Ham man is also a likely mover this summer having made clear his desire to play at a higher lever.\n\nAnd with the Gunners soon likely to confirm Champions League football, and with the player seemingly willing to stay in London, they look to have a golden chance to seal his signature.\n\nAnd even though any fee for Rice will also likely come in at around \u00a3100m, Arteta seems to feel a deal is within their grasp.\n\nFor that factor alone, Arsenal are ready to put all their eggs into the Rice transfer basket.\n\nAs a result, that will leave Liverpool slugging it out with the other big guns to sign Bellingham, leaving Arsenal \u2013 hopefully \u2013 with a clearer and easier run at landing Rice.\n\nREAD MORE ~ Transfer Gossip: Arsenal to eclipse Liverpool to mega-money signing of Real Madrid star"
