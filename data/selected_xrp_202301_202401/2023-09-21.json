        "content": "Temenos, a payments company with links to Ripple since way back in 2016, has now launched a new payments hub on IBM Cloud.\n\nSwiss-based payment firm Temenos announced this week that it has launched a new solution dubbed Temenos Payments Hub on IBM Cloud for Financial Services. The new service is the latest offering from Temenos, whose open network reportedly helps 1.2 billion people in the world meet their banking needs.\n\nHowever, the newly launched hub focuses more on Temenos\u2019 banking partners. It will make it easier for banks to accelerate their digitization journey by seamlessly integrating with legacy payment solutions such as SEPA in Europe and FedNow Instant Payments in the United States. Additionally, it will empower banks to adopt the latest security and compliance measures for digital payments.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSimilar to most core payment-focused products offered by Temenos, the Payments Hub will reduce costs for banks who otherwise would have to build such capabilities.\n\nIt will also enable these institutions to offer an improved user experience and leverage the latest innovations in the world of digital payments.\n\nFollowing the launch of the Temenos Payments Hub, the company also demonstrated its new capabilities with central bank digital currencies (CBDC). The solution focused on retail CBDC usage and explored functionalities such as offline payments.\n\nTemenos\u2019 Ties With Ripple\n\nTemenos is one of the earliest payment companies with ties to Ripple. Back in 2015, the company did a deep dive into Ripple\u2019s solution, labeling it a \u201cfundamental shift in how value can be transported.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFast forward to May 2016, big-four accounting firm Deloitte showcased the integration of Ripple\u2019s technology into Temenos 24, a core technology banking solution. Deloitte at the time stated that Ripple\u2019s solution \u201cdramatically changes the way international payments are being managed and processed.\u201d\n\nWhile Ripple and Temenos are yet to announce any official partnership, the Swiss-based company has long admired the blockchain company\u2019s solution for global payments. Besides, the improved clarity on the status of XRP in the United States may also pave the way for any such partnership to materialize."

        "content": "XRP price outlook is bullish as the asset tests the supply zone at $0.5174.\n\nPro-XRP attorney John Deaton shared his views on the likelihood of a settlement by the SEC in its lawsuit against Ripple.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse critiques the SEC and Chair Gary Gensler for their stance on the crypto ecosystem.\n\nXRP price's long-term outlook is now bullish, as the altcoin sustains above critical support at $0.50. Several bullish developments have likely catalyzed the altcoin\u2019s recovery. The possibility of a settlement in the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) vs. Ripple lawsuit and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse\u2019s statements in Mainnet 2023 set the stage for recovery.\n\nAlso read: Robert Kiyosaki warns of stock crash, says Bitcoin is a bargain today\n\nXRP price recovery likely to continue with settlement in SEC vs. Ripple case\n\nIn a recent X.com space, pro-XRP attorney John Deaton shed light on the likelihood of a settlement in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit. The lawyer explained how the SEC could consider settling with Ripple if the outcome did not influence its litigation against other cryptocurrencies and firms. In the case of Ripple, the status of XRP as a security or non-security has a direct impact on the regulator\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase.\n\nThe SEC is, therefore, less likely to settle the case with Ripple and rather pursue the interlocutory appeal in an attempt to overturn Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 ruling, according to Deaton.\n\nRipple executives call out SEC and Chair Gary Gensler for approach on crypto\n\nCEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed his discontent with the US financial regulator in interviews and appearances, like the one on September 20 at the Mainnet 2023 event. Garlinghouse took to the stage to critique the stance of the SEC and Chair Gensler on the crypto ecosystem. Find out more about it here.\n\nXRP price outlook turns bullish\n\nLockridge Okoth, a technical analyst at FXStreet, evaluated the XRP price chart and shared his outlook on the altcoin. Okoth notes that the asset is currently testing the supply zone at $0.5174 and that la successful breach of this level could push XRP price to $0.5337. This level is significant as it marks the mean threshold of the zone and a decisive break would give bulls an opportunity to push XRP price higher.\n\nXRP/USDT one-day price chart on Binance\n\nOkoth believes that a rejection from the $0.5337 level could push XRP lower to test the foot of the uptrend at $0.4600. At the time of writing, XRP price is $0.5166 on Binance."

Leaders will need precise information moving forward. A new report gives them the details they'll need.\n\nThe report finds with the loss of 900 jobs at the mill, another 2,522 jobs in the region will also be put at risk or lost.\n\n\n\ntook to a webinar to detail the impact of the Pactiv Evergreen closing. The private foundation worked with , which conducted an analysis.\n\n\u201cFor every job lost at the mill, there's 1.8 jobs lost in the entire region,\u201d Syneva\u2019s Tom Tveidt said.\n\nHe said the closure has economic ripples beyond the mill, from beauty and barber shops to dry cleaners and more.\n\n\u201cAll those little businesses that would have probably have no thought how they'd be impacted, but they will be significantly impacted,\u201d he said.\n\nSpending is likely to drop.\n\n\u201cThe average worker at the mill fully loaded was making about $97,000 a year,\u201d Tveidt said.\n\nThe full report, , examines the effect on labor income, economic output, tax revenue and even the state forest industry that had supplied pulp wood to the mill.\n\n\u201cThere was a year-round market for pine pulp wood throughout this region,\u201d said Barry New, with the NC Forest Service.\n\nThe is also a partner to the study, which early on secured $6.5 million in a national dislocated worker grant.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe next issue we've got is where do we focus?

        "content": "Ripple won a landmark decision against the Securities and Exchange Commission this summer when a federal judge ruled its sale of XRP tokens did not, in most cases, amount to a securities offering. The ruling was a major victory for both the company and the crypto industry\u2014but it did not come cheap.\n\nI caught up with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in New York on Wednesday, and he told me the company\u2019s legal bills\u2014which he had pegged at over $100 million in July of 2022\u2014have now grown to around double that. The eye-popping figure reflects both the high cost of litigation and the fact the crypto world is in a life-and-death struggle with the SEC, whose chairman has adopted a relentlessly hostile posture towards the industry.\n\n\u201cYou have to stand up to a bully,\u201d Garlinghouse said on stage at the Mainnet conference prior to our conversation. \u201c[Chair Gary Gensler] is pursuing power, he\u2019s pursuing politics. Not sound policy.\u201d\n\nThis pugnacious attitude has led the rest of the crypto industry, which once scorned Ripple for being overly corporate, to embrace the company as a champion in the fight against a common enemy. How long this fight will go on\u2014and the size of Ripple\u2019s final legal bill\u2014is anyone\u2019s guess as the SEC seeks to appeal the company\u2019s recent victory, and as Gensler doubles down on a harsh enforcement strategy.\n\nIn the meantime, Ripple says it views Asia as a more favorable environment for the company\u2019s future growth plans. That\u2019s been a common refrain in New York crypto circles this week as conference attendees speak wistfully of places like Singapore and Korea, where blockchain events have drawn large throngs and received support from elected officials.\n\nWhile U.S. companies like Coinbase and Ripple have suggested they may relocate their operations altogether to escape the hostile regulatory environment, this is probably just posturing. The size of the U.S. market and New York\u2019s role as a global financial capital\u2014along with their executives\u2019 personal ties to the country\u2014means it\u2019s not realistic for the companies to up and quit these shores. But their frustration with the lack of a regulatory framework is understandable. Just imagine if Ripple could have spent $200 million on product development instead of lawyers.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nPayPal added its new PYUSD stablecoin to Venmo, which will let users send dollars across the two platforms.
