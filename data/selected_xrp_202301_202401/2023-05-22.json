        "content": "The battle for supremacy in cryptocurrencies is nothing new. One such rivalry between Cardano vs XRP has been going on for a long time. While both of them are notable cryptocurrencies in today's market, they use different mechanisms. Cardano is intended for general use, whereas XRP is designed for private banking use. Ripple is also focused on offering an efficient value transfer, while Cardano is primarily focused on fueling a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications, or dApps. The question is, between Cardano vs XRP, who will reach $1 first before 2023 hits?"

        "content": "Ripple, a blockchain and crypto solutions provider, has launched a new platform to enable central banks, governments, and financial institutions to issue their own central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nThe Ripple CBDC Platform will be leveraging the same blockchain technology used on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).\n\nThe platform enables its issuers (e.g. central banks, monetary authorities or commercial banks) to manage the full life cycle of their fiat based digital currency, from minting and distribution to redemption and destruction.\n\nThis allows financial institutions who are holding significant amounts of the digital currency to manage and participate in inter-institutional settlement and distribution functions.\n\nUsers of digital currencies such as corporate and retail end users will be able to hold their digital currencies securely and be able to pay and receive payment for goods and services in the same way other payment and banking apps provide this today, including for offline transactions and non-smartphone use cases.\n\n\u201cAs a trusted partner to several central banks, we believe this platform will help solve problems for many central banks and governments who are devising plans and developing a technology strategy for CBDC Implementations. The innovative capabilities of the platform will help enable instant settlement of both domestic and cross-border payments, reduce risk, and improve the user experience of quickly sending and receiving digital currency on either side of a transaction.\u201d\n\nsaid James Wallis, VP of Central Bank Engagements & CBDCs at Ripple."

        "content": "Ripple\u2019s Vice President of Central Bank Engagements and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) James Wallis recently joined the Thinking Crypto podcast to talk CBDCs with host Tony Edward.\n\nAfter first learning of Bitcoin and blockchain while leading the global payments group at IBM, James quickly became passionate about what he termed a \u201cmind-blowingly amazing\u201d technology because of its ability to create a single source of truth, and the ability to use a token to move value in a much more efficient way than legacy systems.\n\nRipple CBDC Platform Moves the Needle on Digital Currencies\n\nAs the leader at the helm of Ripple\u2019s CBDC initiative, James is responsible for engaging, educating and supporting central banks in their use of digital currencies. In general, he sees three core use cases that most countries are pursuing: greater domestic payments efficiency, improved cross-border payments and expanded financial inclusion.\n\nTo support these efforts, Ripple provides central banks with CBDC insights and education, a sandbox to experiment with the technology, and help with both policy and legal considerations. James\u2019 focus is on \u201creal money pilots\u201d that go one step beyond proof of concepts and use Ripple\u2019s CBDC solution built on the XRP Ledger to mint, manage, transact and redeem digital currencies.\n\nJames and his team are working on a number of new Ripple-led CBDC projects around the world \u2013 including some in Europe \u2013 while Ripple continues to expand the well-documented work with the countries of both Bhutan and Palau.\n\nBhutan is a carbon negative country in the Himalayas with high mobile phone usage but low levels of financial literacy. The country\u2019s Royal Monetary Authority is partnering with Ripple to explore a CBDC that could improve financial literacy and accelerate its use of new technologies while meeting the nation\u2019s sustainability requirements. Ripple has now completed a wholesale CBDC pilot with Bhutan\u2019s Royal Monetary Authority and is currently in the middle of a retail CBDC pilot.\n\nRipple has worked closely with the Republic of Palau to outline a national stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Describing it as possibly the world\u2019s \u201cfirst government-issued national stablecoin\u201d once it\u2019s live, James is excited about its potential for improved payments, creative use cases like promoting tourism to help boost the local economy, and its ability to coexist with any possible future U.S. digital dollar.\n\nProspects for a Digital Dollar\n\nSince the U.S. is a regulatory complex environment it\u2019s likely the road to a US CBDC will be a long journey.\n\nRipple is engaged at multiple levels with the Federal Reserve and through organizations like the Digital Dollar Project to provide input and resources supporting CBDC research and explorations here in the U.S. He did note that commercial banks are increasingly leaning into conversations about how CBDCs will impact markets and what their role might be. James said this growing interest is a positive sign because it\u2019s difficult to envision a retail CBDC in the U.S. without involvement from commercial banks.\n\nRipple is working with organizations like the Digital Euro Association and the Digital Pound Foundation to connect leaders on both sides of the aisle and help further digital currency initiatives around Europe and the UK.\n\nThe Importance of Privacy in CBDCs\n\nAs countries explore CBDCs, central banks will have to make a number of important design and deployment decisions. One critical consideration will be around privacy.\n\nIn an era of digital currencies, most people in the U.S. and in Europe expect a certain level of privacy when it comes to how they spend their money. Policies under consideration in Europe reflect this by exploring thresholds \u2013 similar to how cash is governed today \u2013 under which the government would have no visibility into how you travel with or spend your money. But in a digital world, the default expectation is probably that a record of every transaction exists somewhere.\n\nThe onus is on policymakers to be clear on how they intend privacy to be protected so that the technology can map to those goals and expectations.\n\nForecasting Growth in CBDCs\n\nLooking ahead, James expresses a high degree of optimism and excitement about CBDCs in general and Ripple in particular. Despite recent market volatility and lack of regulatory clarity, he remains confident and steadfast in the utility of blockchain and digital assets like CBDCs, and that they will ultimately drive significant breakthroughs.\n\nWith over 90% of central banks now exploring CBDCs, James expects many more will go into production at some scale within the next several years. As more CBDCs go live, he believes they will have a halo effect for the broader crypto community. Terming it a \u201crising tide that will lift all ships,\u201d CBDC adoption could increase familiarity and confidence in other cryptocurrencies while also driving the creation of better ancillary products like more user-friendly wallets.\n\nTo deliver on that future reality for CBDCs, the Ripple CBDC team is making great progress with partners, on its product roadmap and in advancing thoughtful conversations around CBDCs more broadly.\n\nCheck out the entire podcast conversation to hear more from James or visit ripple.com/cbdc for more on Ripple\u2019s CBDC Platform."
