Laser Digital Middle East, the Dubai-based digital-asset subsidiary of Nomura, will be able to offer virtual asset broker-dealer and investment management services locally, Laser Digital said on Tuesday. Laser plans to launch over-the-counter trading services and digital-asset investment products for institutional investors in coming months, it said. The approval \"will allow us to innovate in the asset class and come up with products that suit the institutions in the virtual asset space,\" Jez Mohideen, chief executive officer of Laser Digital, said in an interview. Launched last fall, Laser Digital is headquartered in Switzerland and has offices in Dubai and London. It chose Dubai as one of its locations because it has a dedicated regulator for virtual assets and a growing cryptocurrency market, according to Mohideen. \u2014Anna Irrera, Bloomberg News"

        "title": "Ripple is Not a Tidal Wave \u2013 the SEC\u2019s Case Against Terraform Labs Provides a Quick Counterpoint to the ... - Mayer Brown",
        "content": "Just weeks after the novel securities analysis in SEC v. Ripple Labs was handed down by Judge Analisa Torres (which we covered in our Legal Update), a different judge in the Southern District of New York has distinguished the approach taken in Ripple and argued against its policy outcomes in another, high-profile enforcement action by the SEC involving digital assets.\n\nIn that case\u2014SEC v. Terraform Labs\u2014Judge Jed Rakoff ruled this week in favor of the SEC on a motion to dismiss, finding the SEC\u2019s amended complaint adequately pled that the crypto assets sold by Terraform Labs and its founder and Chief Executive Officer Do Keyong Kwon qualify as \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d under the Howey precedent.1 While this decision represents only a preliminary review of the issues and accepts the SEC\u2019s allegations as true (for purposes of the motion), it provides useful commentary as well as some counterpoints to the Ripple analysis, including the following:\n\nThe part of the decision certain to attract the most attention is Judge Rakoff\u2019s explicit rejection of the approach used by Judge Torres in the recent Ripple ruling, which drew a distinction between digital assets based on the manner in which they were sold (primary issuance to institutional investors vs. secondary transactions involving retail investors). In doing so, Judge Rakoff stated that the Howey precedent does not differentiate among purchasers, because the manner in which digital assets are purchased would not change a purchaser\u2019s reasonable belief in the promise of future profits. In the Terraform case, the SEC alleged that the defendants actively encouraged both retail and institutional investors to buy crypto assets while touting their ability to maximize returns on investors\u2019 tokens.2\n\nJudge Rakoff appeared to agree with Judge Torres that digital assets do not constitute securities unless their offering, sale or use were tied to an economic benefit being conveyed upon the purchaser.3 However, Judge Rakoff also stated that a crypto asset that is not a security at one point in time may, as its circumstances and those of its related protocol(s) change, become an investment contract\u2014i.e., a security\u2014that is subject to SEC regulation.4\n\nJudge Rakoff\u2019s decision acknowledges that stablecoins \u2013 when designed to maintain a constant value in relation to another asset and intended for use as a stable store of value \u2013 may not qualify as investment contracts because they would theoretically not generate profits through a common enterprise.5\n\nHowever, the SEC\u2019s amended complaint included legally adequate allegations, sufficient to defeat the motion to dismiss, on two key points: The non-stablecoin crypto assets in this case\u2014LUNA, wLUNA, the mAssets and MIR\u2014were investment contracts because they were touted as providing yield to holders in line with the growth of the ecosystem; and The stablecoin crypto assets in this case\u2014UST \u2014were investment contracts because they conferred a right to purchase another security (the LUNA tokens) and because nearly 75% of the tokens were deposited in an investment pool promising returns of up to 20%. 6\n\n\n\nTakeaway\n\nThe Terraform decision underscores that there are many ongoing enforcement actions alleging that the sale or trading of certain digital assets constitutes a violation of US federal securities laws and other US laws. Neither decision\u2014in the Ripple case or the Terraform case\u2014binds other courts that are examining similar sets of facts, and neither decision will be the final chapter in the dispute over these issues.\n\n1 SEC v. Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd., No. 23-CV-1346, July 31, 2023 Opinion and Order (Docket No. 51), at 3-4. The crypto assets in question include the \u201cstablecoin\u201d Terra USD as well as other tokens such as LUNA, wLUNA, mAssets and MIR.

        "title": "Federal Court Declines to Follow Ripple Holding - Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP",
        "content": "Federal Court Declines to Follow Ripple Holding\n\nAs we previously reported in our summary of the Ripple case, a federal district court judged determined that under certain circumstances the offering of a digital asset does not create a security. The reasoning in the Ripple case has been criticized by leading to an outcome that places institutional investors ahead of retail investors and employees. In a separate, recently decided case involving digital assets, another federal district judge has declined to follow the ruling in Ripple.\n\nThe latest enforcement case was brought by the SEC against an issuer of digital coins and its promoters, and among other things alleged fraud in the offering of various digital coins. In finding that the coins at issue were securities under the Howey test, on motion to dismiss Judge Jed S. Rakoff opined that:\n\nIt may also be mentioned that the Court declines to draw a distinction between these coins based on their manner of sale, such that coins sold directly to institutional investors are considered securities and those sold through secondary market transactions to retail investors are not. In doing so, the Court rejects the approach recently adopted by another judge of this District in a similar case, SEC v. Ripple Labs Inc. . . . There, that court found that, \u201c[w]hereas ... [i]nstitutional [b]uyers reasonably expected that [the defendant crypto-asset company] would use the capital it received from its sales to improve the [crypto-asset] ecosystem and thereby increase the price of [the crypto-asset],\u201d those who purchased their coins through secondary transactions had no reasonable basis to expect the same. . . . According to that court, this was because the re-sale purchasers could not have known if their payments went to the defendant, as opposed to the third-party entity who sold them the coin. Whatever expectation of profit they had could not, according to that court, be ascribed to defendants\u2019 efforts.\n\nBut Howey makes no such distinction between purchasers. And it makes good sense that it did not. That a purchaser bought the coins directly from the defendants or, instead, in a secondary resale transaction has no impact on whether a reasonable individual would objectively view the defendants\u2019 actions and statements as evincing a promise of profits based on their efforts. Indeed, if the Amended Complaint\u2019s allegations are taken as true . . . the defendants embarked on a public campaign to encourage both retail and institutional investors to buy their crypto-assets by touting the profitability of the cryptoassets and the managerial and technical skills that would allow the defendants to maximize returns on the investors\u2019 coins.\n\nAs part of this campaign, the defendants said that sales from purchases of all crypto-assets -- no matter where the coins were purchased -- would . . . generate additional profits for all crypto-asset holders. These representations would presumably have reached individuals who purchased their crypto-assets on secondary markets \u2013- and, indeed, motivated those purchases -- as much as it did institutional investors. Simply put, secondary-market purchasers had every bit as good a reason to believe that the defendants would take their capital contributions and use it to generate profits on their behalf.\n\nJudge Rakoff is a respected jurist, and his opinion captures many of the key critiques of the Ripple decision that academics and other commentators have raised. We have seen widespread misreporting in the crypto press and some other news sources on the holding in Ripple and its potential applicability to other digital assets. And as the latest case demonstrates, other federal district court judges\u2014even those in the same district at the Ripple court\u2014are not bound to follow the Ripple order. Accordingly, we continue to believe that until such time as an appellate court weighs in on the Ripple decision, issuers and intermediaries transacting in digital assets should tread carefully in applying the Ripple analysis broadly.\n\nJudge Rakoff also brushed aside two other potential defenses to SEC enforcement that have been gaining interest in the crypto community under the major questions and fair notice legal doctrines. According to Judge Rakoff, \u201cno doctrine -- whether grounded in interpretive canons, statute, or the federal Constitution -- bars the SEC from, as a preliminary matter, asserting that the defendants\u2019 crypto assets are \u2018investment contracts\u2019 that are subject to federal securities laws.\u201d"
