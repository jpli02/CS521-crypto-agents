        "title": "Ripple: massive XRP withdrawals \u2013 a threat to crypto platforms? - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 28 Aug 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\n\u25aa Altcoins\n\nLately, a massive movement has been washing up on the shores of the crypto universe, sending ripples through the once calm waters. Whale Alert, like a lookout in the watchtower, identified a massive migration of XRP tokens from a Dutch platform. In the blink of an eye, almost half a billion tokens disappeared. This action caused a real tremor at the heart of the Ripple crypto.\n\nRipple faced with platform insecurity: rise in XRP withdrawals?\n\nWhales, those entities holding monumental amounts of cryptos, are not without reason in their movements. The recent Ripple crypto exodus is just an echo of a wider phenomenon. Take Binance as an example. It was recently hit by a financial earthquake after the sudden withdrawal of $150 million in bitcoin in one minute.\n\nRepeated incidents, whether due to hacks or abrupt decisions, have eroded user confidence. In a world where security is often challenged, these whales are looking for safe havens for their funds.\n\nTrading platforms are, by their very nature, targets. They centralize huge quantities of funds, making them vulnerable. In this context, the withdrawal of XRP to a cold wallet (a storage medium disconnected from the Internet) appears to be a defensive maneuver. It\u2019s a strategy designed to protect colossal fortunes from market volatility. At the same time, it also serves to guard against potential dangers associated with the platforms themselves.\n\nCrypto: An uncertain future for centralized exchanges?\n\nAs a decentralized currency, XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, aims to free money from traditional constraints. This move could be the canary in the coal mine, signaling a shift where holders of large quantities seek to emancipate themselves from centralized platforms.\n\nWith incidents such as the FTX incident, these platforms could see more users moving towards stand-alone storage solutions, prioritizing security and independence.\n\nThe mass exodus from XRP could presage a growing trend. As trust erodes, the quest for security could reshape the crypto ecosystem. Are we on the threshold of an era in which holders opt for greater autonomy, distancing themselves from the vagaries of centralized platforms? The growing concern surrounding Ethereum underlines the importance of these movements.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The crypto community reacts to claims of XRP holding a unique competitive advantage due to Ripple receiving regulatory approval from 31 US states.\n\nThe XRP community now sees another reason to be bullish about the potential of XRP. In this case, the XRP Army\u2019s bullishness centers around the multitude of licenses Ripple holds across many jurisdictions in the United States.\n\nIn a recent tweet, XRP influencer WallStreetBulls highlighted that Ripple holds regulatory approval from 31 US states. In particular, these are Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe influencer argued that such many approvals grant Ripple and XRP a unique advantage. According to WallStreetBulls, neither Bitcoin (BTC) nor Ethereum (ETH) boasts a similar feat.\n\nMoreover, the XRP influencer highlighted the MTLs as a revolutionary development solely benefiting XRP within the crypto space. In his words:\n\n\u201c\u2026, a unique advantage not held by BTC or ETH. This paves the way for XRP\u2019s mainstream adoption. MTLs allow legal money transmission, a game-changer for XRP alone in the crypto space!\u201d\n\n? Ripple holds Money Transmitter Licenses in 31 U.S. states, a unique advantage not held by BTC or ETH. This paves the way for $XRP's mainstream adoption. MTLs allow legal money transmission, a game-changer for XRP alone in the crypto space! ? #XRP #CryptoNews \u2014 WallStreetBulls (@w_thejazz) August 27, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCrypto Community Reacts\n\nWhile some XRP enthusiasts agreed with WallStreetBulls\u2019 sentiments, the border crypto community contended the sweeping claim.\n\nSince the XRP influencer argued Bitcoin and Ethereum do not hold the licenses Ripple held, someone left a disapproving remark:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Bitcoin CEO will work out for a license.\u201d\n\nThe comment implies that comparing Bitcoin and Ripple in terms of regulatory license was incorrect. Bitcoin is digital money not needing a license, while Ripple is a payment firm requiring approval to process people\u2019s funds.\n\nMeanwhile, others mentioned that Ripple is not the only digital payment firm with that many regulatory licenses. They highlighted that Flexa Network also holds 31 approvals from various jurisdictions in the United States.\n\nRipple Money Transmitter Licenses\n\nNotably, Ripple\u2019s official website confirms the business maintains 31 Money Transmitter License from the US. Missing names on the list include California, New York, Texas, and Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, it is worth noting that Ripple has regulatory approvals outside of the United States. In June, Ripple became one of the few businesses to hold regulatory approval from Singapore, as The Crypto Basic reported."

        "content": "Last week, key stakeholders in the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple legal battle communicated their prospective trial availability to Judge Analisa Torres, who is overseeing the case.\n\nThe representatives from the securities regulatory body and Ripple\u2019s executive team are aligning their schedules for the anticipated trial, set to unfold during the second quarter of 2024. With specific dates earmarked for April and May, the stage is being set for a pivotal showdown between the two parties.\n\nMeanwhile, on August 27, John E. Deaton, legal expert, and Ripple advocate, offered truly interesting insights into the case\u2019s background, particularly the SEC\u2019s former executive Bill Hinman and the infamous Howey Test \u2013 a legal assessment used in the US to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security under federal securities law.\n\nHowey Memo did not suggest enforcement action against XRP\n\nNotably, Deaton explained that on June 13, 2018, the SEC\u2019s enforcement lawyers shared an XRP Howey Memo, applying the Howey Test to sales of XRP tokens.\n\nThe move occurred just a day before Hinman\u2019s speech, an event that played a critical role in the lawsuit, in which the former SEC boss declared Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as non-securities.\n\nBut what is even more interesting is that the presented Howey Memo did not suggest any enforcement actions, Deaton stressed. Similarly, it neither recommended halting XRP sales nor sending a cease and desist letter to Ripple and its executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen.\n\n\u201cGuess what the XRP Howey Memo did NOT recommend in June 2018? It didn\u2019t recommend an enforcement action! It didn\u2019t even recommend a stop selling XRP cease and desist letter be sent to @Ripple, @bgarlinghouse or @chrislarsensf.\u201d \u2013 Deaton said in a tweet.\n\nXRP Howey did not conclude XRP is a security\n\nFurther in the post, Deaton continued that Garlinghouse and Ripple CTO David Schwartz met with former SEC chair Jay Clayton several months after the test was applied to XRP. During the discussions, Garlinghouse allegedly mentioned that \u201cRipple was living in purgatory\u2019 and that XRP lacked regulatory clarity, in contrast to BTC and ETH.\n\nRipple CEO also asked them \u201cwhat gives, [but] neither Clayton nor Hinman told them it was because XRP was a security,\u201d Deaton said.\n\n\u201cWe know very well that the XRP Howey concluded something other than XRP is a security. It kind of makes you wonder why they filed the case as they were leaving the SEC forever, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \u2013 the lawyer concluded.\n\nIn the meantime, XRP was changing hands at $0.51, down 2.6% in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency lost around 1% over the past week and more than 27% on the month.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.

        "title": "In a first, the SEC says NFTs offered by an L.A.-based entertainment firm are securities. Here's how that could ripple ... - Fortune",
        "content": "In an enforcement action announced on Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Los Angeles\u2013based entertainment company Impact Theory with conducting an unregistered offering of securities via non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.\n\nAs the SEC expands its definition of which types of crypto assets qualify as securities, the case breaks new ground by determining that NFTs fall under the agency\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cAbsent a valid exemption, offerings of securities, in whatever form, must be registered,\u201d Antonia Apps, director of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office, said in a statement.\n\nThe question of whether NFTs qualify as securities has remained open for several years. Before the SEC weighed in, a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York remained the highest-profile case to tackle the issue, with a group of NFT collectors suing Dapper Labs. The plaintiffs alleged that the crypto firm had earned hundreds of millions of dollars by selling unregistered securities.\n\nAlthough Dapper Labs motioned for the case to be dismissed last year, a judge ruled in February that it could move forward, concluding that it was \u201cplausible\u201d NFTs could qualify as securities.\n\nDapper continues to argue otherwise, with a spokesperson telling Bloomberg: \u201cCourts have repeatedly found that consumer goods\u2014including art and collectibles like basketball cards\u2014are not securities under federal law.\u201d\n\nThe difference, according to the judge, is that with traditional collectibles, the value would be unaffected if said producers went out of business. With NFTs, where the developer is also managing the blockchain technology behind a collection, its value could be intertwined with the success of the company.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s case, the SEC said that between October and December 2021, Impact Theory offered three tiers of NFTs, called Founder\u2019s Keys, and encouraged investors to view the purchase as an investment in the business. According to the SEC, Impact Theory said it was \u201ctrying to build the next Disney,\u201d and that the NFTs would deliver \u201ctremendous value\u201d to purchasers if the business succeeded.\n\nIn a separate order, the SEC included public statements from the company\u2019s founders. About the NFTs, the company stated: \u201cWe like to say that it unlocks the future of everything that we\u2019re doing as a company\u201d\u2014a tacit acknowledgment that the product was a security, or an investment contract, in the agency\u2019s view. Impact Theory sold nearly 14,000 NFTs to hundreds of investors, raising almost $30 million worth in Ethereum.\n\nWhile Impact Theory did not admit or deny the SEC\u2019s allegations, it agreed to a cease-and-desist order, as well as a $6.1 million fine in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. It will also return all proceeds from NFT sales to investors.\n\nTwo commissioners, Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, dissented, writing in a separate statement that they disagreed with the application of the Howey Test\u2014a Supreme Court precedent that creates a framework for which assets are securities\u2014and that the NFTs did not represent shares in a company or produce any type of dividend.\n\n\u201cThe Commission should have grappled with these questions long ago and offered guidance when NFTs first started proliferating,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIt is unclear whether the enforcement action will be an opening salvo against the broader NFT industry; the SEC has yet to file any lawsuits against major players in the space, such as Dapper Labs. In October 2022, Bloomberg reported that the SEC was trying to prove whether Yuga Labs, creator of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, was offering unregistered securities, although the agency has yet to bring charges.\n\nThe broader crypto industry frequently complains that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has engaged in a policy of \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d by bringing lawsuits against firms without engaging in rule-making to clarify the agency\u2019s jurisdiction or how companies can comply. Gensler has argued that the industry is \u201crife with fraud, scams, and abuse,\u201d and that existing rules are sufficient."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights SEC lead prosecutors' memo indicates that Ripple was aware of the SEC's investigation by June 14, 2018.\n\nThis memo likely indicates that SEC lawyers did not consider XRP as a security by June 13, 2018.\n\nXRP is gaining substantial traction among South Korean investors in their twenties, constituting 20.7% of their investment portfolios.\n\nIn a recent tweet, legal analyst John E. Deaton delves into the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case, shedding light on significant developments that have caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community. Among these revelations, Deaton highlights a memo or statement by SEC lead prosecutors, indicating that Ripple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, and the company were aware of the SEC\u2019s investigation by June 14, 2018.\n\nTo be clear, I didn\u2019t say the memo concluded XRP is not a security. The memo was found to be privileged and not disclosed so I haven\u2019t read exactly what it says. But Judge Netburn found it important to note that the authors of the memo, who were Enforcement lawyers at the SEC,\u2026 \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 27, 2023\n\nThis revelation holds particular significance as it questions Ripple\u2019s reliance on a speech made by former SEC official William Hinman.\n\nQuestioning the SEC\u2019s Take\n\nThe details of the memo remain concealed due to privilege, but this secrecy has stirred up controversy. Reportedly, the memo does not propose any actions against Ripple\u2019s sale of XRP tokens. This raises eyebrows and challenges the narrative Ripple has been putting forward.\n\nDeaton points out that the memo likely indicates that SEC lawyers did not consider XRP as a security by June 13, 2018. However, if this memo carries weight now, it might implicate Ripple\u2019s top brass in violating securities laws. Interestingly, an independent auditor was given the nod by the government in 2015 to closely scrutinize XRP sales every six months and produce comprehensive reports.\n\nRipple Under the Radar\n\nAs of June 2018, authorities had gathered a wealth of three years\u2019 worth of XRP sales data. Ripple\u2019s presentations to regulatory bodies like CFTC, SEC, and FinCEN, alongside their public image of XRP as a decentralized payment system, now face scrutiny. Could Deaton be hinting at the SEC\u2019s growing unease with Ripple\u2019s stance?\n\nRead More: SEC\u2019s Case Against Ripple Weak, Trial Unlikely to Proceed, Expert Says\n\nDeaton also brings in John Reed Stark, a figure known for his skeptical views on cryptocurrencies and his likely belief that Ripple has flouted laws. However, Stark acknowledges the need for an investigation, adding an intriguing perspective. The intricate nature of the case leaves those who value the SEC and fairness feeling uneasy.\n\nBill Morgan Lashes Out\n\nLegal expert Bill Morgan joins the discourse with pointed criticism aimed at the SEC\u2019s perspective on digital asset value, particularly XRP. Morgan argues that the SEC aims to simplify the matter by asserting that digital assets lack concrete value. This approach, he argues, makes it easier to apply the Howey Test to determine their investment status. However, Morgan contends that the SEC overlooks the inherent value digital assets can possess based on their functionality and utility.\n\nThe Ripple vs. SEC battle continues to evolve, evident from the agency\u2019s recent request for an appeal and the availability of trial dates in 2024. This indicates that the legal tussle retains its complexity.\n\nXRP and South Korea\n\nAmidst the regulatory challenges, a positive trend emerges\u2014XRP is gaining substantial traction among South Korean investors in their twenties. Recent data showcases that XRP constitutes a staggering 20.7% of their investment portfolios, surpassing the combined presence of Bitcoin and Ethereum at 17.5%. This surge propels XRP to the position of the second-largest coin in the country, underscoring its appeal among young investors.\n\nAlso Read: It\u2019s Time for Higher Courts to Weigh In: Ripple, Terra, and SEC Case Gets Trickier"
