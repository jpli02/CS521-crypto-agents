        "content": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has lashed out against Jay Clayton, the former Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for showing hypocrisy when it comes to discussions around corporate litigation and the agency\u2019s role.\n\nRipple CEO Recalls Lawsuit\u2019s Initiator\n\nResponding to a CNBC roundtable talk featuring Jay Clayton as shared by Gemini CEO, Cameron Winklevoss, the Ripple CEO recalled that the close to 3-year lawsuit Ripple battled was initiated by Clayton.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne major concern that appeared to anger Garlinghouse was the fact that Clayton left the SEC days after the Ripple lawsuit was filed. The CNBC interview saw Clayton criticizing current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler for abuse of power with respect to the agency\u2019s mode of bringing enforcement actions against crypto firms.\n\nSince taking over the reins at the SEC, Gary Gensler has sued Kraken Exchange for its staking program earlier this year. The markets regulator scored a $30 million settlement with the trading platform agreeing to stop the offering. Besides Kraken, Coinbase Exchange and Binance have also come under the crosshairs of the regulator as the commission claims both platforms facilitated the trading of unregistered crypto securities.\n\nSome of the securities alleged include Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Filecoin (FIL), and Decentraland (MANA) amongst others.\n\nDespite the high-profile cases under Gary Gensler\u2019s SEC, Ripple Labs\u2019 lawsuit as initiated by Clayton is considered the highest-profile legal brawl in the crypto ecosystem in the past few years. It was not until July that the payments firm snatched its first major win as Judge Analisa Torres declared that the programmatic sales of XRP do not constitute an investment contract.\n\nThe aspect of the lawsuit that entangled Garlinghouse and Ripple founder Chris Larsen was also dropped by the SEC this month.\n\nPositive Precedent Set\n\nThe Ripple vs SEC lawsuit has formed a precedent for other related legal cases in the industry according to experts even though there is an institutional aspect of the case to settle in the coming weeks. The ruling from Judge Analisa Torres favored the SEC in that she claimed Ripple\u2019s sales of XRP to institutional investors violates securities laws.\n\nFor this, the SEC is demanding a settlement and conversations around this is billed to start as from November 9. In all, with Coinbase and Binance cases still pending, expectation mounts that these firms can benefit from the ruling in the Ripple case."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe crypto industry has displayed a neutral sentiment for the fourth straight day, indicating the market cooling off from the massive price action it had experienced recently. On the other hand, the XRP price displayed a stable gain in its value compared to other elite cryptocurrencies, raising concern over its future price action.\n\nPossible Ripple Vs. SEC Settlement Outside Court Room?\n\nFollowing the lawsuit where the Ripple coin had lost a significant percentage in its value, the XRP token has been fighting hard to gain momentum and regain the lost status it once had.\n\nThe ongoing case of Ripple vs SEC is crucial as the future of the XRP token largely depends on it. As per the latest rumors, there is a high possibility of the SEC settling the case outside the courtroom, with the regulators possibly demanding over $770 Million as a settlement amount.\n\nIf the rumors are accurate and the settlement is truly done, this will be the turning point for Ripple\u2019s XRP token, as the XRP coin price could then attract more institutional investors and experience a massive upswing soon and record a new high in the coming time.\n\nXRP Whales Selling, Price Dump Underway?\n\nThe XRP whales have displayed a significant movement during the month of October. The whale accounts have collectively dumped over $55 Million during this time, raising the speculation of a possible price dump soon.\n\nThe ongoing selling in the market indicates the historic sentiments to repeat, resulting in the price possibly experiencing a significant cut in its value soon. Despite the bullish trend, the bulls appear to sell, indicating the coin will experience a trend reversal in the coming days.\n\nWill XRP Price Reagin Value?\n\nIf the XRP bulls manage to hold the price above its key level at $0.54, the price may experience a bullish momentum and make a run to test its upper resistance level of $0.64 in the coming time, which could further ignite a strong bullish influence in the maker, resulting in the price making an attempt to reclaim its status of $1.\n\nOn the contrary, if the bears start dominating the market and a trend reversal occurs, the price will lose momentum and fall to test its support level at around $0.50 in the coming time.\n\nMoreover, if the speculations are true and the whales dump their holdings before the Ripple Labs case settlement, the coin is predicted to experience a crash and fall to test its new yearly lows."

        "content": "U.S.-based trading platform Uphold disclosed plans to purchase XRP on the open market for its ODL (now Ripple Payments) transactions, with a promise to not leverage customer deposits.\n\nUphold disclosed this in a recent reply to a customer\u2019s inquiry following their partnership with Ripple. Recall that Uphold and Ripple inked a strategic partnership, as recently reported by The Crypto Basic.\n\nSignificance of the Ripple Partnership\n\nThe partnership would see Ripple leverage Uphold\u2019s trading platform for its Ripple Payments [formerly On-Demand Liquidity (ODL)] offering in the United States. Ripple had desisted from offering Ripple Payments in the U.S. due to regulatory concerns.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFor the uninitiated, ODL is a payment solution that uses XRP to enable real-time, cross-border transfers. It works by converting one currency into XRP, sending XRP across borders, and then converting it back into the destination currency, all within seconds.\n\nDavid Schwartz, in a previous comment, noted that the San Francisco-based company does not provide ODL services with a U.S. nexus. However, he disclosed that they could toe that path without any legal repercussions, supposing the XRP does not come directly from them.\n\nUphold to Buy XRP from the Open Market\n\nInterestingly, the partnership with Uphold would see the firm achieve this goal. However, much like how ODL operates, Uphold would need to purchase XRP to use it as a bridge currency for ODL transactions.\n\nTo gain insight into how Uphold plans to source these XRP tokens, an Uphold customer and a Texas-based XRP community figure asked the trading platform if customers\u2019 XRP deposits would work to provide liquidity for ODL transactions.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn response, Uphold confirmed that it would not be leveraging customers\u2019 deposits. It bears mentioning that XRP makes up Uphold\u2019s largest crypto holding, amounting to $1.25 billion worth of the token in customer funds. For context, customers only hold $168 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) on Uphold.\n\nDespite its substantial XRP holding, the platform plans to purchase XRP on the open market for ODL transactions.\n\n\u201cWe will, however, be using our expertise in sourcing both fiat and crypto (XRP included) on the open market, in order to facilitate the near instantaneous transfer of money across borders via Ripple ODL,\u201d a representative said on X.\n\nHi James & thanks! We never leverage customer funds. They're not ours.. We will, however, be using our expertise in sourcing both fiat and crypto (XRP included) on the open market, in order to facilitate the near instantaneous transfer of money across borders via Ripple ODL. \u2014 Uphold (@UpholdInc) October 24, 2023\n\nThis approach provides a much-needed relief, considering the risks associated with commingling customer deposits with company funds. The FTX implosion of last November stemmed from an unchecked misappropriation of customer funds, especially for uncapped loans to Alameda Research.\n\nSince the FTX collapse, centralized exchanges such as Uphold have been mandated to make public their proof of reserves. Uphold\u2019s recent decision to not touch customer deposits demonstrates its resolve to not misappropriate funds on its platform."
