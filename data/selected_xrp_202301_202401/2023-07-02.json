        "content": "The XRP community is awash with blatantly fake rumors of the impending resignation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProminent XRP accounts like Documenting Ripple have been instrumental in circulating the unconfirmed news.\n\nGensler assumed the role of SEC Chair in April 2021 after an illustrious career in public policy and academia, including serving as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration.\n\nHis tenure has seen a deep focus on the burgeoning crypto market, including the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple Labs, creators of the XRP token.\n\nDespite the swirling rumors, Gensler's resignation seems highly unlikely. His tenure so far has been marked by a distinct push for robust crypto regulations and bringing more transparency to the market, a task that is far from complete.\n\nAs per historical precedence, no SEC chair has resigned within the first two years of their tenure, making Gensler's supposed departure even more dubious.\n\nAdding to the counter-narrative, some prominent XRP community members have started challenging these unverified claims. Jungle Inc, a well-known figure in the XRP community, warned followers of a fake news website spreading the uncorroborated Gensler resignation story. Crypto Eri, another prominent member, also advised the community to be \"responsible users of social media and not follow/share/spread anything without verifying.\""

        "title": "How blockchain is driving the next era of global payments networks - Financial Times",
        "content": "A look under the hood of the global payments infrastructure exposes a rickety engine that has been running banking for decades. Cross-border payments are costly, slow and error-prone because of the complex coordination between multiple intermediaries. Patchwork global regulations and compliance requirements, currency exchanges and painful waiting times due to elements like time zones and opening hours all add logistical weight to the process. For example, an international wire payment using traditional payment rails can take up to four days. In fact, in a 2023 report published by Ripple, cost of payments and settlement speed were two of the most frequently cited challenges for enterprises making cross-border payments.\n\n\u201cThis creates a major discrepancy between customer demand and business capacity,\u201d says Berry. \u201cIt leads to cash flow challenges that inject cost and uncertainty into critical transactions.\u201d\n\nMany finance experts agree that it\u2019s a problem. Ripple\u2019s 2023 New Value Report also found that a majority of payments and treasury professionals view faster payments and cost savings as the top two value propositions for incorporating crypto into their cross-border payments business. With developments such as open banking, digital assets and blockchain providing the tools to revolutionise payments networks, it\u2019s clear that the inhibitive element is the core infrastructure of the banking system itself. Perhaps the solution to infrastructure is software as well.\n\n\u201cBlockchain has all the makings of a transformative answer,\u201d says Doug Fritz, CEO of F2 Strategy, a wealth tech consulting firm. \u201cIt enables payor and payee authentication and translation of value within the same line of code. Security and privacy are also secured at the code level.\u201d\n\nFritz adds: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a formal, governmental-level shared ledger or blockchain structure not being the right path technologically. However, barriers to adoption are high, with historically competitive and non-cooperative counterparties needing to agree or conform.\u201d\n\nA seismic shift in banking has arrived\n\nOne example of how blockchain can be used to update global payments rails is by connecting different blockchains or tokens to enable interoperability. Once the confirmation for a payment is locked in between two parties, a corresponding amount of digitised assets are used to actually move value between parties. Value \u2013 in the form of digital assets \u2013 moves over a blockchain network almost immediately, and then liquidates into fiat currencies for payout via local rails.\n\n\"The magic of how that all happens is because you're using a digitised or tokenised asset, and the flow allows you the ability to move funds quickly,\u201d explains Berry. \"It's achieved without incurring the costs associated with needing to rely on different financial institutions as a middleman in the flow, removing unnecessary parties and fees from a normal construct of correspondent banking.\u201d\n\nThe traditional banking system has been unable to keep up with global commerce and its increasing demand for faster, more reliable payments. Leveraging tokenised assets over a blockchain network, however, provides a distinct opportunity to bypass many of the intermediaries involved in cross-border transactions, enabling near instant settlements at lower costs. A seismic shift in finance has begun.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Scientists have finally 'heard' the chorus of gravitational waves that ripple through the universe - Phys.org",
        "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nThis undated photo provided by researchers in June 2023 shows the Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico. This and several other telescopes around the world were used to observe the slow gravitational waves \u2014 faint ripples made by massive black holes \u2014 that are constantly stretching and squeezing everything in the universe ever so slightly, described in a report released on Wednesday, June 28, 2023. Credit: NAIC via AP\n\nScientists have observed for the first time the faint ripples caused by the motion of black holes that are gently stretching and squeezing everything in the universe.\n\nThey reported Wednesday that they were able to \"hear\" what are called low-frequency gravitational waves\u2014changes in the fabric of the universe that are created by huge objects moving around and colliding in space.\n\n\"It's really the first time that we have evidence of just this large-scale motion of everything in the universe,\" said Maura McLaughlin, co-director of NANOGrav, the research collaboration that published the results in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nEinstein predicted that when really heavy objects move through spacetime\u2014the fabric of our universe\u2014they create ripples that spread through that fabric. Scientists sometimes liken these ripples to the background music of the universe.\n\nIn 2015, scientists used an experiment called LIGO to detect gravitational waves for the first time and showed Einstein was right. But so far, those methods have only been able to catch waves at high frequencies, explained NANOGrav member Chiara Mingarelli, an astrophysicist at Yale University.\n\nThose quick \"chirps\" come from specific moments when relatively small black holes and dead stars crash into each other, Mingarelli said.\n\nThis illustration provided by researchers in June 2023 depicts gravitational waves stretching and squeezing space-time in the universe. On Wednesday, June 28, 2023, researchers reported signals from what they call low-frequency gravitational waves \u2014 changes in the fabric of the universe that are created by huge objects moving around and colliding in space. It took decades of work by scientists across the globe to track down the evidence for these super-slow wobbles. Credit: Aurore Simonnet/NANOGrav Collaboration\n\nIn the latest research, scientists were searching for waves at much lower frequencies. These slow ripples can take years or even decades to cycle up and down, and probably come from some of the biggest objects in our universe: supermassive black holes billions of times the mass of our sun.\n\nGalaxies across the universe are constantly colliding and merging together. As this happens, scientists believe the enormous black holes at the centers of these galaxies also come together and get locked into a dance before they finally collapse into each other, explained Szabolcs Marka, an astrophysicist at Columbia University who was not involved with the research.\n\nThe black holes send off gravitational waves as they circle around in these pairings, known as binaries.\n\n\"Supermassive black hole binaries, slowly and calmly orbiting each other, are the tenors and bass of the cosmic opera,\" Marka said.\n\nThis photo provided by researchers shows NANOGrav team members meeting at Green Bank Observatory in Green Bank, W. Va., in 2018.

It took decades of work by scientists across the globe to track down the evidence for these super-slow wobbles. Credit: NANOGrav via AP\n\nNo instruments on Earth could capture the ripples from these giants. So \"we had to build a detector that was roughly the size of the galaxy,\" said NANOGrav researcher Michael Lam of the SETI Institute.\n\nThe results released this week included 15 years of data from NANOGrav, which has been using telescopes across North America to search for the waves. Other teams of gravitational wave hunters around the world also published studies, including in Europe, India, China and Australia.\n\nThe scientists pointed telescopes at dead stars called pulsars, which send out flashes of radio waves as they spin around in space like lighthouses.\n\nThese bursts are so regular that scientists know exactly when the radio waves are supposed to arrive on our planet\u2014\"like a perfectly regular clock ticking away far out in space,\" said NANOGrav member Sarah Vigeland, an astrophysicist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. But as gravitational waves warp the fabric of spacetime, they actually change the distance between Earth and these pulsars, throwing off that steady beat.\n\nThis undated photo provided by researchers in June 2023 shows the Green Bank Observatory in Green Bank, W. Va.

Credit: Jay Young/Green Bank Observatory via AP\n\nBy analyzing tiny changes in the ticking rate across different pulsars\u2014with some pulses coming slightly early and others coming late\u2014scientists could tell that gravitational waves were passing through.\n\nThe NANOGrav team monitored 68 pulsars across the sky using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and the Very Large Array in New Mexico. Other teams found similar evidence from dozens of other pulsars, monitored with telescopes across the globe.\n\nSo far, this method hasn't been able to trace where exactly these low-frequency waves are coming from, said Marc Kamionkowski, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the research.\n\nInstead, it's revealing the constant hum that is all around us\u2014like when you're standing in the middle of a party, \"you'll hear all of these people talking, but you won't hear anything in particular,\" Kamionkowski said.\n\nThis undated photo provided by researchers in June 2023 shows the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico.

It took decades of work by scientists across the globe to track down the evidence for these super-slow wobbles. Credit: AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein\n\nThe background noise they found is \"louder\" than some scientists expected, Mingarelli said. This could mean that there are more, or bigger, black hole mergers happening out in space than we thought\u2014or point to other sources of gravitational waves that could challenge our understanding of the universe.\n\nResearchers hope that continuing to study this kind of gravitational waves can help us learn more about the biggest objects in our universe. It could open new doors to \"cosmic archaeology\" that can track the history of black holes and galaxies merging all around us, Marka said.\n\n\"We're starting to open up this new window on the universe,\" Vigeland said.\n\nMore information: Gabriella Agazie et al, The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Evidence for a Gravitational-wave Background, The Astrophysical Journal Letters (2023).
