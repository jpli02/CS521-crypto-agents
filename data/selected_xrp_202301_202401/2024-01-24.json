        "content": "Part of the pitch about building layer 2s and sidechains was that XRP was very easy for anybody to get and hold. If you wanted your own token, you would have this big problem of how do we get it to people, and how do people sell it? Let's say you're starting a new blockchain with a new token and I'm gonna provide all kinds of infrastructure for you, and I'm gonna get paid in the new token. I can't really sell that token without sort of cutting my own throat and the project's throat. If you use XRP as your token, you don't have to worry about distribution, it's already distributed. That pitch doesn't work if people can't easily get XRP and can't hold it."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has escalated its legal battle against Ripple with a new motion to compel the production of financial documents and post-complaint XRP sales contracts. On Tuesday, the agency filed a reply to the defendant's opposition to its motion.\n\nSEC's argument for more disclosure\n\nIn a recent filing, the SEC urged Judge Sarah Netburn of the Southern District of New York to order Ripple to disclose audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 as well as all post-complaint contracts for XRP sales to non-employee parties.\n\nThe SEC's motion argues that these documents are critical for determining the appropriate remedies, emphasizing that Ripple's recent financial activity and sales contracts are relevant to the case.\n\nThe SEC has rebuffed Ripple's claims that this request is untimely, insisting that ongoing sales and financial health are pivotal in assessing potential violations and fashioning remedies.\n\nRipple's stance on discovery requests\n\nRipple has strongly opposed the SEC's motion, arguing that the requests are both untimely and irrelevant to the case.\n\nThe company asserts that the SEC had ample opportunity to request this information during the initial discovery phase and accuses the Commission of attempting to introduce a new phase of litigation without proper justification. Ripple also contends that the information sought by the SEC, particularly regarding its post-complaint sales and financial condition, does not bear on the court's decision regarding remedies.\n\nRipple emphasizes that the SEC's approach could potentially lead to a lengthy and unnecessary re-litigation of the case, disrupting the judicial process and imposing undue burdens on all parties involved."

        "title": "Important Ripple v. SEC Lawsuit Development - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nThe SEC is seeking Ripple\u2019s financial records for evidence in their legal case.\n\nThe company has previously secured favorable court rulings, including a decision on the nature of some of its XRP sales.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a new motion compelling Ripple to hand over essential documents such as the company\u2019s financial statements for 2022 and 2023 and its post-complaint XRP sales contracts.\n\nThe regulator argued that those records could provide important information and show whether the firm has violated certain securities laws.\n\nAs CryptoPotato reported, the Commission filed the same motion earlier this month, and Ripple had until January 17 to react.\n\nThe company first insisted the deadline for a response be prolonged to January 19 and later opposed the SEC\u2019s wish, claiming the requests were untimely and unrelated to the case.\n\n\u201cThey are irrelevant: the information the SEC seeks has no bearing on the court\u2019s remedies determination. The SEC apparently wishes to have the court substitute a summary determination as to whether Ripple\u2019s post-complaint sales constitute investment contracts in place of a full proceeding on the merits to resolve that question,\u201d Ripple maintained.\n\nThe latest clash comes less than three months before the grand trial between the two organizations. Ripple seemingly has the upper hand, securing three major (yet partial) wins last year.\n\nThe first one came in July when Federal Judge Analisa Torres determined that the company\u2019s XRP sales to retail investors did not constitute an offer of investment contracts.\n\nShortly after, the US magistrates dismissed the SEC\u2019s intention to appeal the decision, whereas CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen were cleared of all accusations brought by the watchdog."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 23, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a motion to US magistrate Judge of the Southern District of New York, Hon. Sarah Netburn, in further support of its motion to compel Ripple Labs to disclose certain financial documents regarding XRP sales after the 2020 legal action.\n\nThe US SEC\u2019s attorneys, led by Jorge G. Tenreiro, argued that the discovery requests on the targeted XRP transactions are procedural and proper, as Ripple is believed to have violated investment contracts per the Howey test in the regular institutional sales.\n\nThe US SEC\u2019s motion noted that Ripple\u2019s pre-complaint contracts show that Ripple and its Institutional Sales counterparties made a pre-complaint commitment to exchange XRP for cash. However, Ripple has denied any violations and argued any discovery after the legal complaint in 202 should not be considered in the upcoming trial.\n\n\u201cRipple may seek to argue that the Court should not give much weight to Ripple\u2019s financial condition, but that argument cannot be the basis to deny the SEC its ability to discover and present evidence highly relevant to deterrence,\u201d the SEC\u2019s motion noted.\n\nMarket Implication and XRP Price Action\n\nIt may not lead to a mini-trial but there is a lot at stake with this issue. A wide injunction could do a little of harm to Ripple\u2019s ODL business. I think there will be discovery ordered of these post complaint contracts. /4 \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) January 24, 2024\n\nWhile the US SEC indicated that it is not seeking a mini-trial for a settlement deal, Australia-based crypto enthusiast lawyer Bill Morgan argued that a possible court injunction could pose short-term headwinds for Ripple\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) business that taps on XRP.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP price dropped approximately 3 percent in the past 24 hours to trade below the crucial support level of around 54 cents at 51 cents during the early London session on Wednesday."
