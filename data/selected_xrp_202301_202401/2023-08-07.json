        "title": "Centigrade Powers the Next Evolution in Carbon Markets - Ripple",
        "content": "Climate change has emerged as a defining 21st century issue. The ability to sustain life on earth and to mitigate widespread ecological collapse is directly dependent on the world\u2019s collective ability to reduce emissions and transition to a low-carbon global economy as quickly as possible. The good news? There are innovative new technologies and new ways of organizing human and economic activity that are rooted in trust, integrity and validation, and therefore hold tremendous promise.\n\nIntroducing Centigrade: Innovative Infrastructure for Carbon Markets\n\nIn collaboration with RMI (Rocky Mountain Institute), a pioneer in sustainable investing, Ripple is excited to introduce a new company, Centigrade. Centigrade is an open data platform serving the global carbon and nature markets. The platform will provide developers of carbon and nature credits with a low-barrier, intuitive way to bring their projects to market, providing full data transparency and traceability for the entire lifecycle of credits. It aims to open global credit markets to all carbon and nature developers\u2014regardless of size and location\u2014and boost the availability of capital needed to scale carbon removal and nature restoration projects to the required level.\n\nCentigrade is the result of more than a year\u2019s worth of intense learning and collaboration with close partners and a broad and diverse range of key stakeholders. Ripple is proud to be a part of Centigrade as a founding member, investor and technology partner, and excited to help unlock exponential value for carbon project owners, buyers and investors. Ripple will continue to work closely with climate advocates and independent service providers to help grow this market, and be part of the global effort to fight climate change and achieve global climate goals.\n\nWhy Centigrade and Why Now?\n\nWhile carbon markets hold promise as a hedge against climate change, the market for carbon credits\u2014the purpose of which is to help offset temporarily unavoidable emissions and fund climate mitigation activities\u2014is suffering a crisis of confidence. This is in part due to doubts cast on the efficacy and durability of its inventory, but also because (in its current incarnation) it is glacially slow, inefficient and not scalable.\n\nDespite the earnest efforts of its early architects, today\u2019s carbon markets are bereft. There is a lack of high quality supply, as defined by important factors like provable climate impact (can you measure it?), additionality (is it new?) and permanence (will it last?). This is in part because carbon removal companies do not have the capital they need to grow their projects. Demand and the capital that flows from it is stuck; held back by outdated, overly centralized market mechanisms that have created a lack of transparency and trust, long and laborious due diligence processes and unnecessary risk. Put another way, today\u2019s carbon markets are underperforming: they are addressing less than 1% of the problem, far from their vast and vital potential.\n\nAnother problem is that carbon markets are too narrow. They have been overly focused on carbon, and the role of trees\u2014reforestation, afforestation, avoided deforestation\u2014in solving the crisis. In fact, there is a broad and diverse range of climate positive activity across the elements that make up our natural world; not only carbon, but also air, water, soil, biodiversity and the human element, sometimes referred to as equity. This is a holistic ecosystem view and something markets should fully embrace and more intentionally reflect if they are to deliver the intended environmental, human and economic impacts.\n\nInnovating the Way Forward, Together\n\nSo, what can be done to help modernize and scale carbon markets?\n\nUpdate and expand shared definitions of what constitutes measurable climate positive activity, creating new ways to describe\u2014and ascribe economic value to\u2014products derived from carbon removal and the full array of ecological services and their co-benefits.\n\nIn partnership with independent scientists, climate nonprofits, farmers and ecopreneurs, develop and adopt a new framework that recognizes these benefits in a way that enables project owners to more easily classify their products and bring them to market faster.\n\nEnable fairer, higher price discovery and connect suppliers with more suitable buyers and investors\u2014particularly for those in the global south\u2014where harmful emissions have been lowest, but the negative effects of climate change have hit \u201cfirst and worst.\u201d\n\nApply this unlocked capital not only to currently available products (\u201cspots\u201d) but also to future production (\u201cforwards\u201d) to increase supply, liquidity and market dynamism\u2013which in turn can help deliver capital to where it is needed most, widening the path to net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nLeverage the power of transformative, decentralized technologies with the potential to expand and accelerate climate fighting enterprises, unlocking exponential value for both suppliers and buyers.\n\nEnable and activate a new class of service providers that create value for the market and its participants, instead of extracting it.\n\nBlockchain as a Catalytic Tool\n\nRipple and other industry players recognize that blockchain can be a catalytic tool for helping global carbon markets reach their full potential. At its core, blockchain enables more efficient transactions. Unlike proof-of-work blockchains, the open source blockchain technology that powers Ripple\u2019s solutions, the XRP Ledger, is natively sustainable, requiring low amounts of energy and no cryptocurrency mining. The XRPL is the first major blockchain to achieve net zero status through the purchase of renewable energy for its remaining energy use.\n\nIn 2022, Ripple made a $100M commitment to help scale global carbon markets and began investing directly in high quality carbon removal, in part to fulfill the company\u2019s commitment to reach net zero by 2030 (or sooner), but also to help capitalize and scale some of the world\u2019s most promising new carbon removal companies.\n\nWhile it is by no means a panacea, blockchain technology is well suited to solve some of carbon markets\u2019 most persistent pain points, including double counting (and fraud); a lack of scalability due to outdated, low technology market infrastructure; and low transparency and trust. Blockchain can help digitize carbon credits in a way that improves their reliability, specificity and trustworthiness as investable, durable assets.\n\nThe Journey Towards a Greener Future Continues\n\nAs with any technology, blockchain is a potentially powerful solution, but it is \u201cneutral,\u201d offering capabilities that need to be harnessed appropriately with the real-world needs of market participants and desired outcomes in mind.\n\nIn pursuit of this, Ripple began a learning journey through a series of deep partnerships with well-respected, climate-focused NGOs, including Rocky Mountain Institute, the Lexicon of Sustainability, Conservation International, Greenpeace and others. In addition, the company began working directly with leading carbon removal companies with significant traction in the marketplace. For the past year, Ripple has been collaborating with CarbonCure, BC Biocarbon, Carbon Title and Newlight Technologies to tokenize their inventory in ways that capture the full value and diversity of their projects, methodologies and impact.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say a lot has been learned, both in terms of what this market needs to scale but also in terms of its potential for positive climate impact. The inception of Centigrade marks an important next step in this journey, not only in Ripple\u2019s march towards a more sustainable future, but in the global fight against climate change and how to leverage today\u2019s technology to fulfill the promise of a better tomorrow.\n\nVisit http://www.centigrade.earth or check out the latest press release to find out more."

        "content": "Shares\n\nRadical Transparency for Voluntary Carbon Markets\n\nAnnouncing Centigrade, a new platform to dramatically grow the supply of quality, trustworthy carbon credits from RMI and Ripple\n\nCarbon markets have long been held up as efficient mechanisms to affordably achieve a safer climate future. By pricing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, allocating finance to climate-aligned activities, and incentivizing investment \u2014 to new technologies, key behaviors, and institutions \u2014 carbon markets promise to both protect our natural carbon sinks, such as forests, and remove the 10-13 gigatons of carbon per year necessary to stay on track for net zero by 2050.\n\nYet creating effective carbon markets has proven elusive, even as they have evolved into two broad categories. Compliance markets \u2014 those anchored in policy, law, or regulation \u2014 do not reach the scope or scale required to address the climate challenge. Voluntary carbon markets (VCMs), meanwhile, are challenged by growing complexity and competing demands.\n\nVCMs operate based on rules set by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other public purpose-minded organizations. VCMs allow private parties to buy and sell carbon credits representing the avoidance, reduction, or removal of GHGs from the atmosphere.\n\nBack when wind, solar, and other renewable energy technologies struggled to become cost competitive, VCMs provided an additional, critical source of financing to help them grow and compete with fossil fuels. However, in recent years, voluntary markets have been overburdened with multiple functions they weren\u2019t designed to perform completely or simultaneously. These include: offering a path to net-zero for the world\u2019s largest corporations; providing revenue to countries seeking climate-aligned economic growth; and creating financing mechanisms for early-stage technologies so they can reach the commercialization threshold.\n\nAs a result, VCMs are immersed in a complicated transition. While growing rapidly, VCMs must also refine their processes to ensure two priorities. First, all credits must deliver measurable and verifiable emissions impact (i.e., either emissions reduced or avoided). Second, the efficiency, accuracy, and transparency potential of digital technologies must be integrated without introducing new risks or excessive costs. With all this in transition, today\u2019s VCMs can be opaque, fractured, and complicated to navigate.\n\nAmid this transformation, RMI sees an opportunity to help recenter VCMs on their core mission: to expand the supply of quality credits with verified climate and equity co-benefits and to ensure credits are efficiently and accurately valued for their climate performance. To this end, RMI is partnering with Ripple, a leading fintech company, to launch Centigrade, a new listing platform that will focus on untangling the data that is central to all claims about credit quality, facilitate interoperability with a dynamic ecosystem of VCM service providers, and enable radical transparency in these markets.\n\nVCMs\u2019 Challenge and Opportunity\n\nIn recent years, VCMs have come to embody both the promise and the complexities of our collective efforts to combat climate change and rapidly decarbonize to reach the Paris Agreement goal limiting temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C by 2050. VCMs have experienced tremendous growth and could be a critical financing mechanism for a wide range of climate solutions, from halting deforestation to scaling direct air capture technologies.\n\nBut, this growth is colliding with existing institutions and opaque processes that were not designed to harness such sudden and innovative demand and that have yet to settle internal debates around how best to define, measure, and value a \u201cquality credit\u201d based on its climate performance (i.e., actual emissions, community, and ecosystem benefits).\n\nIn the simplest terms, VCMs are currently constrained by a condition called \u201cinformation asymmetry\u201d in which the underlying data and information about credits (namely their performance and transaction history) remains siloed and disconnected throughout the value chain. Since granular, updated data about credits\u2019 climate performance is difficult for the broader market to access and use for decision-making, most credits are issued and priced based on a pass/fail assessment of subjective claims about their performance, rather than real-world performance verification. The challenge of accessing critical credit information has left VCMs struggling to perform the core functions of an efficient market: facilitating market competition and directing capital toward projects with measurable climate and equity co-benefits.\n\nChallenges within VCMs are spurring innovation and growth, with numerous new companies popping up to tackle unique aspects of the supply, demand, and transaction landscapes. But few solutions are directly and systematically tackling the structural roots of the problem: the core information asymmetry that must be addressed for the market to maintain its public purpose function. While it will take time to build consensus around carbon market regulation, we can and must build the partnerships, data frameworks, and supporting market infrastructure that can bring much needed transparency, reliability, and integrity to VCMs. Climate impacts are intensifying and will continue to do so. Meaning, the time to build what we can is now.\n\nCentigrade: Today and tomorrow\n\nAs launched, Centigrade will enable radical transparency in VCMs by focusing on untangling data related to credit quality claims and facilitating interoperability with a dynamic ecosystem of VCM service providers. And as the platform evolves, RMI will work with Ripple to focus on these objectives:\n\nAccelerate supply development : Centigrade is a platform designed for earlier-stage suppliers to list their pipeline projects, and to make forward claims based on carbon restoration, reduction, and removal potential. This unique approach enables suppliers to efficiently access an ecosystem of pre-issuance services, including upfront project finance, quantification methodology development, or verification and certification services. We hope this will accelerate the speed at which these suppliers develop and issue credits. This is in line with our mission to cultivate innovation by the supplier community.\n\n: Centigrade is a platform designed for earlier-stage suppliers to list their pipeline projects, and to make forward claims based on carbon restoration, reduction, and removal potential.

Reduce information asymmetry about credit data : Centigrade won\u2019t be a standards setter and won\u2019t establish methodologies for whether credits are certified. Instead, it sets a minimum bar for the data about credit performance for a range of non-traditional credit pathways that must be disclosed to be listed on the platform and to access the verification and certification services required to turn that data into credits. Data transparency will allow market participants to more efficiently surface projects\u2019 differentiating core market metrics and unlock participation from the broader market.\n\n: Centigrade won\u2019t be a standards setter and won\u2019t establish methodologies for whether credits are certified.

Enabling interoperability : Once onboarded to Centigrade, all participants will be able to seamlessly exchange information relevant to credit quality, better integrate their efforts, and establish more efficient methods of navigating the market. Currently, the market is fragmented, with a multitude of actors operating independently and using disparate methodologies, protocols, and solution frameworks. By bringing together a variety of service providers from trading platforms, certification entities, ratings agencies, and other partners, we can maximize the efficient and transparent flow of critical information about credit performance over time.\n\n: Once onboarded to Centigrade, all participants will be able to seamlessly exchange information relevant to credit quality, better integrate their efforts, and establish more efficient methods of navigating the market.

As this project continues, RMI will work alongside Centigrade\u2019s founding team to govern transparently and with a humble commitment to ensure that, at all times, Centigrade is advancing the climate impact and public interests that are central to VCMs\u2019 potential to accelerate the rate at which finance flows to the technologies and solutions that advance climate justice and build a decarbonized economy by 2050.\n\nLike any other functional market, VCMs will not be effective without a fully liquid exchange that allows for efficient price discovery, demand signaling, and transactional integrity based on climate performance. So, how do we maintain the primacy of public purpose in VCMs? It can happen through laws and regulations, but we are running out of time and haven\u2019t seen the progress necessary. It can happen through standards and certification, except issues around globally accepted standards and opaque process continue to be a challenge. Or it can happen through unprecedented levels of transparency.\n\nFor dynamic markets, transparency is akin to oxygen. It allows market participants to more efficiently discover project quality and prices based on key market and climate metrics. It allows for more scalable and accurate demand-supply matching. And it unlocks much broader participation from the market. Centigrade will bring this radical transparency \u2014 and vital oxygen \u2014 to VCMs.\n\nRead the full press release here\n\nLearn more about Centigrade here"

        "title": "Judge Rakoff puts the Ripple Party on Ice as the Crypto Community and SEC Ponder their Next Moves - Mintz",
        "content": "Just barely two weeks ago, we wrote about the half-victory for Ripple Labs in its ongoing litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), in which Judge Analisa Torres granted partial summary judgment in favor of Ripple on the issue of whether certain sales of Ripple\u2019s XRP cryptocurrency tokens were \u201csecurities\u201d under the federal securities laws. Some in the crypto industry interpreted her ruling to mean that secondary transactions in crypto assets on centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges were not transactions in \u201csecurities,\u201d even though Judge Torres expressly declined to address the secondary trading issue. Fast forward to today, and a new ruling out of the SDNY against Terraform Labs casts further doubt on this interpretation.\n\nRipple Recap\n\nIn her ruling on the status of XRP tokens as \u201cinvestment contracts,\u201d Judge Torres concluded that under Howey certain sales of XRP tokens to institutional investors met the definition of \u201cinvestment contracts,\u201d while programmatic sales to individuals and retail investors via digital currency exchanges did not meet the same definition. Judge Torres\u2019s decision hinged on how the XRP tokens were sold and what Ripple itself disclosed to purchasers of the tokens. While Ripple gave fulsome disclosures to institutional investors and as such, those individuals understood that purchasing XRP was investing in Ripple, retail investors purchasing XRP on the secondary market did not receive similar disclosures and were thus unaware they were buying XRP from Ripple, let alone investing in Ripple. The Ripple court determined that this difference in the nature of the transaction\u2014and the buyer\u2019s understanding in a particular transaction\u2014drove the analysis of whether or not the XRP token sales at issue were \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d and thus \u201csecurities.\u201d\n\nAs we noted, the court\u2019s decision created an awkward dynamic favoring applying the protections of the federal securities laws to institutional investors, but not retail investors. We also highlighted that if other courts were to adopt Judge Torres\u2019s reasoning, the critical factor in deciding whether a token is a security would be how that token is sold. Our key takeaway was that the split decision left both the SEC and the crypto industry in a tenuous holding pattern given the court\u2019s focus on the nature of the transaction and the identity of the buyer, and the uncertainty concerning whether other judges faced with the same question would adopt Judge Torres\u2019s reasoning.\n\nTerraform Decision\n\nWithin two weeks, a different judge within the Southern District of New York (this time, Judge Jed Rakoff) confronted a similar question, but came to a very different conclusion. In SEC v. Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd. and Do Hyeong Kwon, the defendants moved to dismiss the SEC\u2019s complaint arguing that the cryptocurrency tokens Terraform Labs (\u201cTerraform) developed and sold were not \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d (and thus \u201csecurities\u201d) under the Howey test. According to the defendants, Judge Torres\u2019s decision in Ripple was \u201cfatal\u201d to the SEC\u2019s case that Terraform\u2019s digital assets were sold as investment contracts. But Judge Rakoff disagreed, emphatically rejecting the ruling in Ripple and Judge Torres\u2019s application of the Howey test. Judge Rakoff concluded that, at the Rule 12 stage, the SEC had met its burden of alleging that the tokens qualified as securities.\n\nIn Terraform, the SEC challenged Terraform\u2019s sale of crypto assets (including its UST Coin) to investors in the United States. Terraform is a South Korean-based blockchain project that created a peer-to-peer payment network that also supported other decentralized applications. Terraform\u2019s network depended on a suite of \u201cstablecoins,\u201d or crypto assets whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar, to serve as a \u201cuseful medium[] of exchange\u201d based upon its stable value compared to other, volatile crypto assets. Unlike a \u201ctraditional\u201d stablecoin that is pegged directly the value of a real world asset, Terraform created a stablecoin, the UST Coin, which was indirectly pegged to the U.S. dollar by algorithms. The SEC alleged that Terraform marketed the UST Coins to investors as stable investments that would retain their value in perpetuity given they were pegged to the USD. The UST Coins then conferred a right to purchase Terraform\u2019s LUNA Coins to investors. Ultimately, while UST Coins were supposed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the value of the USD, the UST Coins lost their peg because they artificially derived their value through an algorithmic pairing with the LUNA Coins.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s allegations, Terraform also launched in April 2019 a blockchain to house transactions using the UST Coin and other crypto assets the company developed, but the market demand for these coins did not develop fast enough. In response, Terraform allegedly began a concerted marketing effort in September 2020 for UST Coins as \u201cprofitable investment opportunities.\u201d Terraform directed these efforts at US investors and at investment conferences in the US, as well as on social media. Terraform also created the \u201cAnchor Protocol,\u201d an investment pool in which owners of UST coins would deposit their coins and \u201cearn a share of whatever profits the pool generated.\u201d By doing so, and by advertising potential return of 19-20% for investors, Terraform allegedly boosted the demand for UST Coins. Terraform also represented to investors that the continued profitability of UST Coins and the Anchor Protocol was dependent on the continued development of the \u201cbroader Terraform \u2018ecosystem,\u2019\u201d which required maximizing the total volume of transactions processed on the blockchain.\n\nAt bottom, according to the SEC\u2019s allegations, Terraform allegedly offered and sold these assets via unregistered transactions to both institutional and retail investors, and imposed no restrictions on the resale of certain crypto assets with the understanding that the tokens \u201cwould be resold to the public.\u201d The SEC also alleged Terraform violated the federal securities laws simply by \u201cdirectly offering and selling\u201d certain tokens and other assets on \u201ccrypto-asset marketplaces.\u201d Lastly, the SEC alleged that Terraform defrauded investors by representing that its Coins were \u201cstable\u201d investments that would always retain their value, yet took steps unbeknownst to investors to artificially prop up the value of the stablecoins to preserve their value. These actions allegedly \u201crestored confidence\u201d in the Terraform marketplace and caused investors to invest billions of dollars into transactions on the ecosystem, only for the market for UST coins to collapse one year later (in May 2022), wiping out nearly $40 billion of total market value.\n\nThe SEC alleged that the above activity constituted violations of the antifraud provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act (along with Rule 10b-5), and separately, that Terraform\u2019s failure to register the offer and sale of its crypto-assets separately violated the 1933 Act\u2019s requirement to register such offerings.\n\nIt should be noted that the Court here was considering the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and as such, the defendants had a particularly high burden to meet under Rule 12 (in contrast to the Ripple court\u2019s decision on summary judgment). Here, Judge Rakoff weighed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and uniformly rejected all grounds on which it moved. Most critically for the crypto industry writ large, the Court determined that the SEC pled a plausible claim that Terraform\u2019s crypto assets (including UST Coins and LUNA Coins) were \u201csecurities\u201d under the Howey test for investment contracts. The Court\u2019s decision accepted all of the SEC\u2019s allegations as true for purposes of the motion, and thus focused on the full set of facts and circumstances governing the transactions in Terraform\u2019s crypto assets, and in so doing, rejected the Company\u2019s suggestion to separately analyze whether the coins themselves were \u201csecurities\u201d and then whether the investment protocols were as well.\n\nThe Court noted that the original UST Coins and LUNA coins \u201cmight not then have been, by themselves, investment contracts,\u201d and that \u201cwhere a stablecoin is designed exclusively to maintain a one to-one peg with another asset, there is no reasonable basis for expecting that the tokens -- if used as stable stores of value or mirrored shares traded on public stock exchanges -- would generate profits through a common enterprise.\u201d But in the case of the UST and LUNA Coins, Judge Rakoff concluded that the circumstances around both tokens changed over time such that it would be inappropriate to erect artificial barriers between the coins and the investment protocols.\n\nThe Court next determined that according to the SEC\u2019s allegations, Terraform\u2019s crypto assets, taken together, met the element of a \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d under Howey. In sum, the Court found that the SEC met its burden by establishing the various crypto assets (UST Coins, LUNA Coins, and others) were allegedly either: (1) pooled together in the various investment protocols for the purposes of collective management by Terraform, whose managerial efforts created an expectation of profit generation that would then be redistributed to the individuals who had deposited their tokens in the protocol; or (2) sold to generate proceeds that would be used to develop Terraform\u2019s blockchain further, which would increase the value of the tokens sold.\n\nLastly, the Court determined that if the SEC\u2019s allegations were true, Terraform\u2019s actions created a reasonable expectation of profits in its customers (the 3rd prong of the Howey test). Put another way, the SEC met its burden of alleging that a reasonable investor would believe profits would flow to it from their investment in Terraform\u2019s crypto assets. The SEC met its burden through its allegations regarding Terraform\u2019s marketing of the potential profitability of the Anchor Protocol or the future investment returns from Terraform\u2019s use of proceeds from the sale of the LUNA Coins to \u201cfurther develop[] the Terraform ecosystem.\u201d In short, the SEC properly alleged that Terraform \u201cheld out to the coins\u2019 consumers the possibility of profiting from their purchases,\u201d which was sufficient to meet the 3rd Howey prong.\n\nIndeed, the most newsworthy part of the Court\u2019s opinion was Judge Rakoff\u2019s emphatic rejection of the applicability of the Ripple decision. The Court noted that it \u201crejects the approach recently adopted by another judge of this District in a similar case\u201d and declined to \u201cdraw a distinction between these coins based on their manner of sale\u201d as Terraform argued it should. Judge Rakoff noted that the Ripple court\u2019s distinction between institutional purchasers and retail investors purchasing on digital exchanges was wrong because \u201cHowey makes no such distinction between purchasers,\u201d and for good reason\u2014because whether the distinction of whether a purchaser \u201cbought directly from the defendants or . . . in a secondary re-sale transaction has no impact on whether a reasonable individual would objectively view the defendants\u2019 actions and statements as evincing a promise of profits based on their efforts.\u201d According to the Court, Terraform customers, regardless of their method of purchase, would have learned about Terraform\u2019s representations regarding the use of proceeds from sales of Terraform coins to generate additional profits for all asset holders. All Terraform customers, therefore, had \u201cevery bit as good a reason to believe that [Terraform] would take their capital contributions and use it to generate profits on their behalf.\u201d\n\nThe Court also denied dismissal on the other grounds Terraform raised, namely:\n\nThe Court determined that it had personal jurisdiction over Terraform. Using a 2022 decision from the Second Circuit in a related SEC case against Terraform as the baseline, the Court determined Terraform had extensive contacts with the US, marketed and promoted sales to US customers, entered into agreements to sell crypto assets to US trading firms, and met with US investors at US-based conferences.\n\nThe Court rejected Terraform\u2019s argument that various statutory interpretation doctrines (for example, the Major Questions Doctrine) and the Administrative Procedure Act prohibited the SEC from alleging Terraform\u2019s digital assets were \u201csecurities\u201d under the federal securities laws. In particular, the Court (much like the Court in Ripple) rejected Terraform\u2019s argument that the SEC\u2019s decision to regulate crypto assets as securities violated the Due Process Clause and the APA because crypto companies did not have fair notice of the SEC\u2019s intention to do so. The Court noted that rather than paint all crypto assets as securities, it was sufficient that the SEC has consistently asserted that some crypto assets may be securities \u201cdepending upon their particular characteristics.\u201d\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Judge Rakoff\u2019s decision in Terraform does not disturb the contrasting decision of Judge Torres in Ripple, it does create an internal split among the judges of the SDNY and, more importantly, significantly more uncertainty for crypto companies and the SEC moving forward. The SEC, in responding to Terraform\u2019s request for supplemental briefing regarding the Ripple decision, argued that Judge Torres\u2019s decision \u201cconflicts with and adds baseless requirements to Howey and its progeny.\u201d The SEC also called the Ripple decision \u201cwrongly decided\u201d as to the distinction between sales to institutional investors and programmatic sales. As to the internal split within the judges of the SDNY, the SEC noted in the same filing that it was \u201cconsidering the various available avenues for further review\u201d of the Ripple decision and \u201cintend[ed] to recommend that the SEC seek such review,\u201d thereby indicating it would appeal the decision to the Second Circuit. It is too early to know whether Terraform\u2019s attorneys intend to seek interlocutory review of the Court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss. Regardless, the SEC, regulators, and crypto markets can likely expect the Second Circuit to weigh in on the application of Howey and whether crypto asset sales constitute an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d (at least with respect to the XRP tokens sold by Ripple) at some point in 2024.\n\nGiven the differing opinions of the judges in these cases at different stages of litigation, and the likelihood that the facts and circumstances of each crypto asset and offering will dictate applicability of the federal securities laws, the only likely way to ensure uniformity and certainty for the industry moving forward will be an act of Congress. Clearly the Ripple decision did not have that effect, nor (likely) will the Terraform decision. Yet some congressional momentum has started to gather, with the House Financial Services Committee recently advancing a bipartisan bill out of committee aimed at: (1) clearly defining when crypto assets qualify as securities under the federal laws; (2) expanding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s scope of regulatory authority over the crypto industry; and (3) clarifying the SEC\u2019s scope of authority over the industry. It is too early to know whether such a bill could pass a divided Congress, let alone be signed by the Biden Administration. Yet until Congress acts, the question of when and how a digital asset becomes a \u201csecurity\u201d subject to the federal securities laws and requiring registration remains far from settled.\n\nSubscribe To Viewpoints"
