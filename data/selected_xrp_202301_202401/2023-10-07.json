        "content": "Judge Analisa Torres shut down the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s hope for an interlocutory appeal on Wednesday.\n\nIn a ruling, Torres wrote that the appeal for a stay of trial was also denied, ensuring that the trial against Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen will move forward as previously planned.\n\nTorres denied the SEC\u2019s ability to pursue an interlocutory appeal on the grounds that her previous order \u2014 which gave Ripple a partial win \u2014 did not entail an order that \u201cinvolved a controlling question of law,\u201d which is necessary for the certification of an interlocutory appeal.\n\nThe court did not find a \u201csubstantial ground for difference of opinion,\u201d Torres wrote.\n\nIf neither of those legal standards applied, then the SEC could have argued that the certification would \u201cmaterially advance the termination of the litigation,\u201d but Torres did not find merit in that argument.\n\n\u201cHere, the SEC has not presented a \u2018pure question of law\u2019 that could be \u2018decided quickly and cleanly without having to study the record,\u201d Torres wrote.\n\n\u201cThe SEC does not argue that the Court applied the wrong legal standard in deciding the cross-motions for summary judgment,\u201d she continued. \u201cRather, the core of the SEC\u2019s argument is that the Court improperly applied the Howey test to the facts in the undisputed record.\u201d\n\nAs cited by Torres herself, the SEC has said that the Howey test should be applied to \u201cthe facts and circumstances at hand,\u201d which means that its argument is not valid.\n\nThe SEC filed its appeal in early August. At the time, the agency said that the appeal would \u201cavoid the possibility of engaging in protracted remedies\u201d in litigation.\n\nRipple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter.\n\nFollow Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial with the latest news from the courtroom."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\n\n\nRipple\u2019s trial against the SEC in April 2024 is pivotal for XRP\u2019s price.\n\nPartnerships with banks like HSBC and macroeconomic factors will impact its valuation.\n\nXRP is currently more trending than Bitcoin due to recent legal victories.\n\nCould XRP Thrive Next Year?\n\nThe popular AI-powered language model ChatGPT could not directly answer the question of whether the Ripple community will witness a price surge of XRP in 2024. However, it pinpointed several factors that could play a role in such a development.\n\nRegulatory clarity is mentioned as the most fundamental. Ripple\u2019s legal battle against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to reach a conclusion next spring as the trial date is set for April 23, 2024.\n\nPreviously, the blockchain enterprise secured two landmark court victories, following which XRP\u2019s price spiked significantly.\n\nAnnouncements of new banking partnerships or adoption by financial institutions come in the second position. It is worth mentioning that the British bank HSBC and the American behemoth Chase Bank recently allowed eligible clients to conduct certain payments in XRP instead of fiat. However, those moves had little-to-no effect on the coin\u2019s valuation.\n\nOverall crypto market trends, technological advancements, supply and demand, speculation, and others complete the list of elements. One factor worth paying particular attention to is the global macroeconomic environment.\n\nIt is safe to assume that a potential recession or any kind of financial crisis could have a negative effect on the entire cryptocurrency sector. On the other hand, positive news surrounding geopolitical conflicts or the Fed\u2019s probable decision to halt its anti-inflationary policy could be welcomed by bulls.\n\nXRP is Currently the Most Trending Crypto\n\nBesides speculating on the future price of the coin, it is important to observe its current condition. The latest Ripple win against its big enemy \u2013 the US SEC \u2013 has turned the asset into the top trending one in the entire crypto realm.\n\nXRP gathered huge attention and was among the best performers after Ripple\u2019s first landmark victory in July, too. Back then, trades involving the token comprised 21% of the total cryptocurrency trading volume, while BTC was second with 20%."

Here's why it is a crucial milestone for Ripple, XRP Ledger and XRP in 2023.\n\nXLS-30 AMM testing competed: XRP Ledger becomes DeFi blockchain\n\nExtensive performance testing of the XLS-30 upgrade to the XRP Ledger protocol was successfully completed. The update is ready to natively bring basic DeFi functions \u2014 cross-assets swap, liquidity providing and trading \u2014 to XRPL. This statement was made by the RippleX team on their official X account today, Oct. 7, 2023.\n\n1/ Extensive performance testing of the XLS-30 #AMM has now been completed.\n\n\n\nXLS-30 is a proposed amendment as part of the rippled 1.12.0 upgrade.

It is set to be a major technological advancement for the entire XRP Ledger ecosystem.\n\nBesides an extensive set of features, the upgrade will introduce several new transaction types that will integrate with the payments engine.\n\nAs recalled by Ripple developers, in July 2023, the proposal underwent stringent third-party audits by the leading blockchain security firm CertiK.\n\nIn early September 2023, XLS-30 and XLS-39 Clawback upgrades were merged to the code base of the proposed release, as covered by U.Today.\n\nWhen mainnet activation?\n\nIn the last 12 months, Ripple developers researched the readiness of the XRP Ledger mainnet to adopt such upgrades in terms of compatibility and performance:\n\nTo complement a secure codebase, the RippleX team has conducted ongoing performance testing of the core XRP Ledger for over a year. A rigorous methodology has been employed to assess the ledger\u2019s and consensus\u2019s performance and latency to ensure the health of XRPL Mainnet\n\nAs such, the blockchain now started the referendum procedure on the necessity of the activation of the proposed changes on the XRP Ledger mainnet.\n\nShould the active nodes supporting the upgrade hit the threshold of 28/35 and hold it for two weeks, the new rippled 1.12.0 upgrade will get activated.\n\nAlso, Evernode, an L2 scaling platform on top of XRP Ledger, completed its audit and is getting closer to public mainnet launch."

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nA pro-Ripple legal expert, John Deaton, has elucidated on a probable settlement scenario between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple instead of proceeding to trial. Here are the key points from his discussion:\n\nSettlement Instead of Trial: Deaton postulates that a trial is unlikely due to a recent decision viewed as a setback for the SEC. He questions the SEC\u2019s ability to prove its case, advocating for the consideration of a settlement or dismissal of charges to avoid the complexities of a trial\u200b.\n\nDespite a trial date set for April 2024, Deaton boldly predicts that a trial might not occur due to the slender odds of SEC\u2019s success, weak evidence, and hefty legal costs associated with the case\u200b. Settlement Discussions: There have been arrangements for legal counsel representing Ripple and the SEC to engage in settlement discussions before a crucial pretrial conference scheduled for April 16, 2024\u200b.\n\nUS District Judge Analisa Torres mandated Ripple and the SEC to discuss a potential settlement, showcasing a legal pathway toward resolving the lawsuit outside of court\u200b. Factors Influencing Settlement: Deaton emphasizes that any potential settlement should avoid negatively impacting other crypto-related lawsuits, reflecting the broader implications of the Ripple case on the crypto industry\u200b.\n\nHe also points out that the SEC is engaged in other significant legal battles with companies like Coinbase and Binance, which could strain their resources and add complexity to their efforts, thus potentially making a settlement with Ripple a more appealing option\u200b. Potential Reduction of Claim Amount: In upcoming hearings before Judge Torres, there might be debates over the appropriate settlement amount, with Ripple likely aiming to reduce the initial $770,000,000 claim by excluding sales related to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) and arguing for the inclusion of legitimate business expenses. Impact on Crypto Industry: Deaton expresses concerns over the limited scope of the ruling, which could leave many projects in a regulatory gray area, thus potentially discouraging innovation in the U.S. He underscores the crypto industry\u2019s ongoing quest for comprehensive regulatory clarity for sustained growth and leadership in blockchain technology\u200b.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple Emerges Victorious at PAY360 Awards: A Testament to Its Resilience\n\nThese points encapsulate the crux of Deaton\u2019s argument for a possible settlement between the SEC and Ripple, reflecting on the broader implications for the crypto industry amidst the legal quandaries facing Ripple and other crypto enterprises."

Since the implosion of crypto exchange FTX last year, the agency has fired off a barrage of enforcement at industry, including lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThis week, the judge denied SEC\u2019s motion to appeal parts of the Ripple verdict.
