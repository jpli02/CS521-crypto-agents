        "title": "New York crypto regulator removes Ripple and Dogecoin from token 'greenlist' in latest update - Fortune",
        "content": "On Monday, the New York Department of Financial Services announced an update to its virtual currency oversight regime, including new criteria for how digital firms licensed by the agency can list different cryptocurrencies. As part of the revamp, DFS removed over two dozen tokens from its \u201cgreenlist\u201d of approved tokens, including Ripple, Dogecoin, and Litecoin. Eight tokens are still on the list, including Bitcoin, Ether, and the new PayPal Dollar.\n\nAs Congress continues to drag its feet on crypto regulation, DFS has established itself as a nation-leading digital asset supervisor thanks to its BitLicense program and virtual currency unit. While the crypto industry frequently critiques the department for its laborious licensing process, the new guidance demonstrates DFS\u2019 measured approach to crypto regulation, as other state and federal agencies opt for enforcement actions.\n\nDFS created the token greenlist as part of its broader crypto supervision. Under the previous guidance, firms licensed by DFS through its virtual currency program could gain approval to custody and list tokens by a self-certification system that helped streamline the process but still granted the department a supervisory role, as the firms still had to inform DFS.\n\nOnce two firms had self-certified a token for either custody or listing, the cryptocurrency would be included in the DFS greenlist, meaning the token would be approved for custody or listing by any DFS-licensed firm, further expediting the process and facilitating the use of the approved tokens.\n\nAccording to an August version shared with Fortune, the greenlist previously included 25 tokens approved for custody, listing, or both, with prominent names including Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and the new PayPal Dollar.\n\nAs part of its new guidance, DFS announced it would be updating its greenlist, which now has only eight tokens. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap issued by the BitLicense grantee Circle, did not appear on either the previous or the updated versions of the greenlist.\n\n\u201cThe list of greenlisted coins has been updated to follow the new general framework for greenlisted coins,\u201d a DFS spokesperson said in a statement shared with Fortune.\n\nIn a press release shared on Monday, DFS said that the new guidance would \u201cclarify\u201d the department\u2019s expectations for coin-listing and delisting policies of DFS-regulated entities. Along with updating the greenlist, DFS said it would be heightening risk assessment standards for coin-listing policies and enhancing requirements for retail customer-facing businesses, a departure from the previous self-certification system. Licensees must also now have a token-delisting policy that ensures that firms can end support for coins in a way that mitigates the impact on users.\n\nUnder Superintendent Adrienne Harris, the department has taken a strict oversight role during the crypto bear market. DFS brought its first penalties against cryptocurrency companies, including a $100 million settlement with Coinbase in January 2023 for failures in its compliance program. In February, DFS ordered the crypto firm Paxos to stop issuing BUSD, a leading stablecoin that it issued in partnership with Binance.\n\nDFS has still won the begrudging respect of many in the U.S. crypto industry, with other regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission reluctant to engage in rule-making for the volatile sector. The updated greenlist reflects a persistent dilemma for crypto firms, and especially exchanges, as they decide which tokens to include amid regulatory uncertainty.\n\nNote: While Ripple is technically separate from the XRP token, DFS uses the term \u201cRipple\u201d in its publications."

        "title": "Broad Ripple mural honoring Mpozi Mshale Tolbert painted over - IndyStar",
        "content": "A mural honoring the life of Mpozi 'Pozi' Mshale Tolbert, a local DJ and IndyStar photojournalist, has disappeared from the Broad Ripple business where his homage had stood for the past 15 years.\n\nTolbert's likeness, painted with angel wings and leaning over a turntable with the bright Indianapolis skyline behind him, is gone. In its place Monday was a barren white wall, a blank space devoid of any life or color.\n\nIndyStar reached out to LAVA, a hookah lounge serving American & Middle Eastern food in the 6300 block of Guilford Avenue, concerning the mural's disappearance but received no response as of Tuesday midday.\n\n\"Pozi was amazing,\" said Brian Presnell, 51, of Indianapolis, a longtime friend of Tolbert who collaborated on the mural project. \"He was like this warm hug you needed at the end of the day. That mural meant a lot to his mother and her family. She lost her other son, Pozi's brother, in a Blackhawk training accident a year after Pozi died.\"\n\nThose who helped create the mural said they had no idea the artwork was endangered. Given the inclusion of the phrase \"in loving memory,\" Shannon Wilson questioned why anyone would paint over it without first talking to those involved.\n\n\"I would think that it would be clear, the importance of the mural \u2014 being a memorial mural, to almost anybody. So I'm not sure why they decided to do that,\" said the arts administrator and co-founder of the BRIDGE Collective, which painted the first version of the mural.\n\nA group of artists with the BRIDGE Collective created the mural in 2008, two years after Tolbert died at age 34.\n\nThe wall where it lived was particularly important because it was the former Patio music venue, which closed in 2005, said artist Dan Handskillz, who also participated in the design and painting.\n\nAs an integral part of Indianapolis' music scene, Tolbert contributed to the venue and neighborhood in myriad ways in front of and behind the scenes, Handskillz said.\n\nArtists touched up the mural over the years, but in 2020, Ron Miner \u2014 known as DJ Indiana Jones \u2014 spearheaded a makeover with FAB Crew members Handskillz and Benjamin Long. Then-business owner Omar Barham, who died later that year, repaired the wall to lengthen the life of the new piece, which reimagined the original concept, Handskillz said. Miner died in 2020 as well.\n\nThe mural that stood for the past three years payed homage to Tolbert's skill as a DJ and included inspiration from Tolbert's notebooks and writings as well as Indianapolis and Philadelphia, Handskillz said.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Tolbert freelanced as a reporter covering Philly's breaking news and vibrant music scene, according to Indy Arts Guide. He joined the Indianapolis Star at age 26 where his wide-spanning career captured rescue workers sifting through the rubble of the World Trade Center after 9/11.\n\nMore:See some of Indy's great graffiti spots\n\nTolbert's creative efforts included dropping beats as a DJ at a Broad Ripple nightclub playing reggae and Brazilian music, according to Indy Arts Guide. He maintained a studio in Fountain Square where he also displayed his photography.\n\n\"By destroying these things ... it signals to some of us that that cultural legacy has no value. There's no replacing it. It's not going to come back around,\" said Handskillz, who especially noted Broad Ripple's musical significance in the 1990s.\n\nA second mural honoring Tolbert's life remains in the Fountain Square neighborhood.\n\nPresnell lamented the decision to paint over Tolbert's mural, saying he played an important role in documenting Black music, such as hip-hop group The Roots, and photographed daily life in Indianapolis with a tenacity that left an impression on everyone who came into contact with him.\n\n\"I can't stress enough how much Pozi meant to people,\" Presnell said. \"He mattered. He was really good for our city when we had him, and that mural was testament to that.\"\n\nMore:Ron Miner AKA 'DJ Indiana Jones' is honored with a mural on the Vogue Theatre\n\nJohn Tufts covers evening breaking and trending news for the Indianapolis Star.

        "title": "Autoworkers strike will have ripple effects for consumers and other workers - Texas Standard",
        "content": "A United Auto Workers strike is in its fourth day, with walkouts underway at plants owned by Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2013 formerly known as Chrysler. Some 13,000 workers at three midwest auto plants walked off the job on Friday.\n\nThe UAW says automakers should share more of their record profits with workers, while the companies say they need to manage labor costs to stay competitive with non-unionized rivals.\n\nAs the two sides dig in, more auto plants and suppliers will feel the strike\u2019s ripple effects this week, says Micheline Maynard, who writes about the automotive industry for her newsletter, \u201cIntersection: Everything That Moves.\u201d Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.\n\nThis transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:\n\nTexas Standard: Now let\u2019s talk about the reasons for this strike. Is this primarily about higher wages for union workers? What are they asking for specifically?\n\nMicheline Manynard: It\u2019s definitely is about higher wages. The UAW is looking for a 40% increase in wages. And one of the things to understand is that while veteran workers make about $32 an hour, the newly hired workers only make about $17 an hour.\n\nI was reading a testimony from a worker today that said that she has to have a second job at the dollar store because she just can\u2019t make it on $17, after all the taxes are deducted.\n\nThey\u2019re also talking about a shorter work week?\n\nThey\u2019d like to have a shorter work week. There\u2019s been some talk of a four-day work week, but I\u2019m not sure that the carmakers can adjust to that. That might be just too big of an ask for this time.\n\nSo this is what\u2019s called a targeted strike. Just three plants \u2013 9% of the unionized workforce involved. What\u2019s the bigger tactic, do you think?\n\nWell, I think the bigger tactic will be that they\u2019ll move the strike around. So the Arlington, Texas, plant is probably a place that should be counting on hearing from the UAW, maybe sooner rather than later. They\u2019re picking plants that make the most important vehicles, and the most important vehicles to the big companies are their pickups and sport utility vehicles.\n\nArlington, Texas \u2013 yeah, that\u2019s ground zero for a lot of those big SUVs that roll out from General Motors. It\u2019s not just the plants where workers are striking that are affected. I mean, we\u2019re talking about the impact on facilities and tons of suppliers now.\n\nAbsolutely. And so you have to remember that some of these factories make parts for other factories.\n\nSo the plant in St. Louis that is on strike makes parts for a plant in Fairfax, Kansas. And so that plant will probably go down because they don\u2019t have the parts coming from Wentzville, Missouri. So there\u2019ll be a ripple effect not only from the outside suppliers, but within the networks of the car companies.\n\nYou spent some time at the Wayne, Michigan, Ford plant where workers are striking. What was the vibe? What was the mood? What were you hearing?\n\nI was there on Friday and of course, the first day everybody\u2019s kind of fired up and ready to walk the picket line. But what I was hearing from them is that they\u2019re very concerned about this whole issue of what they call tiers, and that\u2019s the people that were newly hired and they make so much less.\n\nAnd I was talking to workers with 29 years seniority and 18 years seniority, and they said, \u201cyou know, it\u2019s just not fair for us to get paid more than people working right next to us that are doing the same job.\u201d And so even the older workers are looking out for the younger workers in this.\n\nI\u2019m not a learned economist or anything, but I remember what happened the last time there was a shortage of vehicles. That was during the pandemic, and we saw prices skyrocket. In fact, there are stories of 2021, 2022 [cars] still sitting on lots built during that period and they can\u2019t be sold. They\u2019re so expensive. What\u2019s this all going to mean for the consumer, do you think?\n\nWell, the average price of a vehicle is now over $48,000, which is just kind of breathtaking. I think prices probably will go up if vehicles are in short supply.\n\nThat said, when they went into the strike, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis \u2013 which used to be Chrysler \u2013 all had some pretty decent inventory numbers. So it won\u2019t be hurt by dealers probably for another month or so. And hopefully they can settle this within a month. But if it does drag on, there could be some shortages of vehicles and then prices will definitely go up.\n\nI have to ask, because you seem fairly optimistic about a month, is there a chance that this could really be settled that soon? And we were talking about this strike coming at a momentous time for U.S. automakers as they make a transition to EVs, and a lot of them are struggling to try and make ends meet.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s different about this strike is that the Biden administration is really getting involved in this. I have never seen a situation where a U.S. president\u2026 He sent a couple of his advisers to oversee the negotiations. So if you\u2019ve got people in Washington looking over your shoulder, I think the likelihood of a settlement is probably greater than if Washington kept kind of a hands-off attitude towards this.\n\nCan you give us a sense of just how vulnerable Texas is economically to this? I mean, we\u2019ve talked about that plant in Arlington that General Motors has to build the biggest of their SUVs. Where else might Texas be vulnerable here?\n\nWell, you have to remember that parts come up from Mexico. And so there\u2019s that pipeline coming up from Mexico to Texas. There are vehicles going out from Texas to the rest of the nation. And so I would definitely keep an eye on the Arlington plant.\n\nOne thing I would tell people to watch for \u2013 the car companies have these big yards next to the plants where they put vehicles that are waiting to be shipped. When I drove by the Ford plant up here, that lot was empty. I have a feeling they got those vehicles out of there in anticipation of strike.\n\nSo keep an eye on those big lots next to Arlington and see what happens with all that inventory."
