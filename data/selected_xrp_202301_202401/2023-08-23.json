        "content": "Wed 23 Aug 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\n\u25aa Altcoins\n\nOver the past few weeks, there have been several positive developments surrounding the Ripple XRP crypto. Some of these have been extremely positive, with several experts wetting their oats in favor of its price explosion. But what\u2019s really going on?\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP crypto in a declining performance situation\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP crypto is currently worth $0.49. It has fallen by 4.44% in the last 24 hours. This represents a 6.94% drop over the past week. Recently, however, Thomas Kralow predicted that the price of XRP could soar to $30.\n\nHis prediction was based in particular on Ripple\u2019s partial victory over the SEC handed down by Judge Analisa Torres. In the wake of this decision, XRP seemed to have recovered. But things have taken a turn for the worst of late.\n\nOver the past two weeks, XRP has lost around 10% of its value. Experts attribute this to the SEC\u2019s call, which is said to have sown uncertainty among the asset\u2019s holders. As a result, many of them began selling off their holdings.\n\nWith doubts hanging over XRP\u2019s growth potential in the wake of this development, ChatGPT was once again called upon. The conversational agent is asked to give its opinion on the asset\u2019s valuation potential in a bull market.\n\nHow High Can #Ripple ( $XRP ) Go During the Next Bull Market? https://t.co/BrU427xBVQ \u2014 BLAH BLAH \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb (@BLAH9999999) August 15, 2023 XRP growth prospects during the next bull market\n\nXRP prospects according to ChatGPT\n\nThe conversational agent didn\u2019t venture to put out any figures on XRP. However, the tool did engage in a sort of factorial analysis of the crypto. Its opinion suggests a series of factors that could influence the crypto price.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s main factor influencing the potential rise in XRP\u2019s price is market perception. If the latter is positive in the minds of investors, this can amplify interest in the crypto and encourage its adoption.\n\nIt goes without saying that sustained adoption of XRP could lead to a rise in its price on the crypto market. A dynamic that could also be seen with a strengthening of optimism around the asset. Especially if the SEC appeal fails, for example. The overall situation of the crypto industry is also decisive for the trajectory of the XRP price. A generalized bull run in the market would be profitable for all cryptos, including XRP. This was notably the case during the last bull run from mid-2020 to the end of 2021. A period which saw most cryptos reach record levels.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ripple\u2019s CEO and Chairman submit dates they will be unavailable for the SEC trial in Q2 2024.\n\nTop executives of Ripple Labs have chosen the dates they will not be available for the upcoming SEC trial. In a letter shared by seasoned lawyer James K. Filan, Ripple execs- Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen- informed the court that they will not be available for trial from April 1, 2024, through April 14, 2024.\n\n#XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP Counsel for @bgarlinghouse and @chrislarsensf have informed Judge Torres the dates they will not be available for trial in the second quarter of 2024. pic.twitter.com/o7VwXR847b \u2014 James K. Filan ???? (@FilanLaw) August 22, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe parties made the submission in response to the court\u2019s directive, which requires them to notify the court about dates they will not be available for trial in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAside from the dates mentioned above, Ripple\u2019s execs have indicated they will be available for the court proceeding throughout Q2 2024.\n\nUpcoming Trial in SEC v. Ripple\n\nIt is worth noting that a part of the SEC v. Ripple case is expected to go to trial in Q2 2024. The trial will determine the legal liability of Garlinghouse (Ripple CEO) and Larsen (the company\u2019s co-founder).\n\nRecall that the SEC accused the execs of aiding and abetting Ripple in distributing XRP as an unregistered security. The SEC claims both Garlinghouse and Larsen were reckless in allowing Ripple Labs to distribute XRP the way it did.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to the court\u2019s order, the parties have until December 4, 2023, to submit all pretrial filings alongside relevant exhibits.\n\nSEC May Not Submit Blackout Dates For Trial\n\nAs Ripple execs have submitted their blackout dates to the court, the SEC is also expected to do the same. However, the SEC may not indicate when it will not be available for the trial.\n\nRecall that the SEC, in its request for interlocutory appeal, asked the court to pause the scheduled trial based on its appeal plans.\n\nAs expected, both Garlinghouse and Larsen filed an opposition to the SEC\u2019s request to stay the trial proceeding against them. Ripple execs lawyers argued that the default statutory rule for an interlocutory appeal states that such an appeal shall not \u201cstay\u201d proceeding in the district court.\n\nRipple CEO Boosts Legal Team\n\nAs the trial edges closer, Garlinghouse has made significant moves to bolster his defense. According to letters shared by Filan, two esteemed lawyers from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP have indicated an interest in representing Garlinghouse in the case.\n\nAttorney Caleb J. Robertson officially filed an appearance to appear as counsel for Garlinghouse in the SEC case.\n\nIn parallel, Attorney Michael A. Schulman filed a motion seeking to represent the Ripple CEO as Pro Hac Vice.\n\nFor context, Pro Hac Vice is a legal term that indicates a lawyer\u2019s request to practice in a jurisdiction where they have not been licensed. Notably, both lawyers will defend Garlinghouse in the upcoming trial."

        "title": "XRP has erased almost all of its gains following the landmark SEC v. Ripple ruling. What happened? - Fortune",
        "content": "XRP, one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, skyrocketed in mid-July. However, the digital asset has since fallen back to Earth, trading near 53 cents at time of publication, a bit more than its 48-cent mark prior to a landmark ruling from a federal judge involving Ripple, the company that uses XRP to fuel its business.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, XRP had a market capitalization of approximately $28 billion\u2014compared with roughly $25 billion before the Ripple ruling\u2014but that\u2019s after reaching $43 billion on July 20, when it traded for 82 cents.\n\nXRP\u2019s sudden tumble mirrors broader market downturns. Bitcoin, which dominates the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, is down from a high above $31,000 on the day of the ruling to now near $26,000. The S&P 500 is down almost 2%, and the NASDAQ has dropped about 3%.\n\nHowever, XRP\u2019s gains and losses are more pronounced.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that XRP has given up its gains both due to the general poor crypto market performance and as the decision may not be conclusive,\u201d Brian Rudick, a senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told Fortune. \u201cThis is because the judgment is not binding precedent, the SEC is moving to appeal it, and full resolution could take months or years.\u201d\n\nThe dramatic ups and downs of XRP reflect the roller-coaster ride of sentiment following the unveiling of the initial Ripple ruling in mid-July. In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, alleging that its sale of XRP to venture capitalists, deep-pocketed investors, retail customers, and others was akin to offering unregistered securities.\n\nFor years, the litigation wound its way through court, as many onlookers waited eagerly for its result amid increasingly aggressive barrages from the SEC against crypto companies. Whether the court found XRP to be security, over which the SEC would have a high latitude of regulatory control, or a commodity, something more akin to sugar or gold, would influence how courts would interpret future cases\u2014and therefore the future of the crypto industry in the U.S.\n\nIn mid-July, Judge Analisa Torres delivered a summary judgment, finding XRP to be a security in its sales to institutional investors, or venture capitalists and those from financial firms, and not a security in its sales on secondary markets, which include crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.\n\nMany saw Torres\u2019s ruling to be a win for Ripple, and XRP almost doubled in price in one day. However, since the ruling, the SEC has said it intends to appeal, and another judge in a separate piece of crypto litigation rejected the defense\u2019s invocation of the Ripple ruling.\n\nMoreover, regardless of the legal battle, there is a larger discussion of the cryptocurrency's inherent usefulness, according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise.\n\n\"Even if you remove all the legal risk around XRP, there is still the huge question of whether it will gain useful adoption in the world,\" he told Fortune. \"After the initial burst of excitement, I think some people realized: There is still a long row to hoe.\""

        "content": "Ripple Operations has debuted a suite of software purpose-built for the inland marine industry that works both online and offline so that limited internet connectivity is not a problem.\n\nRipple, as the software is known, began with tools for tracking compliance but quickly expanded to add maintenance and crew management options, said Chad Mitchell, Ripple Operations CEO.\n\nBoosted by artificial intelligence, Ripple can also put a company\u2019s towing safety management system (TSMS) into action by using a series of \u201csmart triggers.\u201d For that reason, company representatives sometimes describe it as \u201cSub M in a box.\u201d\n\nReal-Time Capabilities\n\nDean Shoultz, founder and chief technology officer, explained some of Ripple\u2019s capabilities, including turning TSMS lists into actionable items.\n\nSign up for Waterway Journal's weekly newsletter. Our weekly newsletter delivers the latest inland marine news straight to your inbox including breaking news, our exclusive columns and much more. Your Email Email Address Subscribe\n\nFor example, if a vessel is approaching the Vicksburg Bridge, which is notorious in the navigation community, the system knows exactly where the vessel is, how many barges are in tow and what they are carrying and could respond with screen prompts that include approach checklists as configured by users that pop up from 1 to 3 miles in advance. The system also monitors the boat\u2019s speed in real time and can generate alerts back to the office if it detects an anomaly, such as a speed too fast for conditions.\n\nDesigned for simplicity of use, the system also has drag and drop graphic capability so that if a boat is dropping off barges at a fleet, the system recognizes the boat is arriving, prompting a screen where the pilot can drag and drop a graphic of the correct barge in the tow diagram at the fleet in an instant instead of making a log entry to note the business transaction, Shoultz said.\n\nAdditionally, he said, the system includes prompts such as when it is time for crewmembers to complete an inspection. It can quickly spawn entire maintenance plans, using a \u201cwizard\u201d where crewmembers input data such as their engine type and then select from detailed or simple plans.\n\nWhat Shoultz calls the \u201csecret sauce\u201d of the system is an intuitive replication engine, leading to a system designed to provide better analytics and reporting while also reducing data entry time and being far less prone to errors. Additionally, he said, the step-by-step, sequential series of screen prompts is easy to understand, and all systems function locally in real time.\n\n\u201cOur system is designed to be functional at all times, independent of connectivity,\u201d Shoultz said.\n\nSafety And Convenience\n\nMitchell said that while Ripple includes many different tools for mariners, all of them have the end goal of increasing the number of safe miles traveled. It does that, in part, by providing screen prompts so that instead of trying to remember all the steps of a checklist, pilots can focus on what they do best: steering the boat.\n\nRipple also has benefits for shoreside personnel. For example, if the company suddenly needs to replace a crew member on a vessel, Ripple can quickly generate a list of choices based on factors such as the type of license a mariner has, which people have experience with the boat and how close they live to where the boat is operating.\n\nThose in shoreside operations also appreciate that there are no more cases of forms that were forgotten to be completed or those filled out twice, Mitchell said. Additionally, because Ripple knows exactly where a vessel is, it also automatically logs when it is entering or exiting a taxable waterway.\n\nRipple offers integration with standard NEMA-compliant devices, including Rose Point. It can also tie in directly to an AIS unit.\n\n\u201cWe try to be as accommodating as we can with whatever they already have,\u201d Shoultz said.\n\nAdditionally, Mitchell said, while some competitors have designed \u201cclosed\u201d systems that prevent exporting data elsewhere, Ripple includes an open, flexible architecture that allows customers to access all of their data so they can use it however they want.\n\n\u201cThey built the platform to be configurable so the company\u2019s processes can be built into how it operates rather than forcing companies to operate based on how their system works,\u201d he said.\n\nThat may be one of the reasons Ripple is gaining industry attention. While Mitchell said they keep customers\u2019 names confidential, they include one of the largest river businesses headquartered in Paducah, Ky., and support organizations with as many as 5,000 mariners.\n\nPricing is based on a monthly subscription and is available either scaled to the size of the company and number of vessels or through bundled options. Potential customers may learn more and schedule a demo through the company\u2019s website at rippleoperations.com.\n\nCaption for photo: Ripple\u2019s Tow View feature.
