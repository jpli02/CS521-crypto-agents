        "title": "Better Buy: XRP or Solana? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If you're deciding between XRP and Solana, here's what you need to know.\n\nBitcoin traditionally leads the way in any new bull market rally for the crypto market. And that's precisely what has happened this year. Bitcoin's massive triple-digit gains this year have lifted the entire market, encouraging investors to seek out new altcoins (i.e., any coin that's not Bitcoin) to add to their portfolios.\n\nTwo altcoins that particularly stand out right now are XRP (XRP -0.08%) and Solana (SOL -1.48%). Both have turned in stellar performances this year, and both are showing up on the radar screens of investors looking for large-market-cap cryptos with long-term upside potential. So let's dig in to see which one is the better buy right now.\n\nRecent performance\n\nFor the year, Solana has easily been the better performer, delivering 465% returns. Solana started the year trading for just $10, and is now trading around $55. Of all 25 cryptocurrencies with a greater than $3 billion market cap, Solana now ranks as the top performer of 2023, and it's not even close.\n\nOn the other hand, XRP has more closely tracked the performance of Ethereum. XRP is up 79% for the year, while Ethereum is up 70% for the year. Granted, XRP nearly doubled in price in mid-summer, but it has now given back almost all of those gains. So if you're only thinking short term, then Solana is the obvious winner.\n\nLong-term growth prospects\n\nBut, remember, we're long-term investors here, and what we should really be interested in is the long-term growth potential of these cryptos, not recent market performance. And that's where things get interesting, because you could easily argue that XRP has the higher upside potential of the two, simply because it seems to be further along on the path to mainstream adoption.\n\nXRP is the token powering the Ripple payment platform, which is a decentralized blockchain network primarily used for making cross-border transfers at very low cost. Since the launch of this payment network nearly a decade ago, Ripple Labs (the creators of the XRP token) has partnered with major financial institutions to build this technology.\n\nThe focus for XRP has primarily been on cross-border remittances. However, the hope is that, as more and more financial institutions embrace this technology, new use cases could emerge. Most interestingly, the underlying Ripple payment technology could be used in the development of new central bank digital currencies.\n\nIn comparison, Solana's blockchain platform is much more in the early stages. That makes sense, since Solana only officially launched in 2020. Yes, everyone agrees that the Solana blockchain is already one of the fastest in the industry, capable of processing 65,000 transactions per second. But the big question is how institutions are actually going to use this extremely fast transaction-processing capability. One clue came this September, when Solana announced a partnership with Visa on the launch of a new payment project featuring stablecoins.\n\nThe regulatory factor\n\nIt's almost impossible to talk about these two cryptos without also mentioning the SEC. XRP has been embroiled in a long-running court battle with the SEC since December 2020. The SEC claims that XRP is actually an \"unregistered security,\" and not a cryptocurrency. And Solana ran into trouble with the SEC this year, when three different court cases filed against major cryptocurrency exchanges indirectly named Solana as a potential \"unregistered security.\"\n\nSo you can see the problem here. Both cryptocurrencies come with a sizable amount of regulatory risk. From my perspective, the XRP court battle seems to be nearing the final stages, while the Solana court battle may just be getting started. XRP's court battle has already lasted three years, and top executives at Ripple say it may end up costing more than $200 million to fight the SEC. So just imagine the potential future impact on Solana if the SEC is really serious about moving forward with any sort of enforcement action.\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nAs much as the choice between XRP and Solana should be about current market performance and future upside potential, it's really all about regulatory risk. If you are extremely risk-averse, then both of these cryptos may be too hot to handle. But, if you are willing to accept some of the volatility caused by regulatory risk, then Solana might end up being the better option. For now, Solana has only been mentioned indirectly in other lawsuits, and there is no sign that the SEC is ready to move directly against Solana.\n\nMoreover, I really believe in the long-term growth potential of Solana. From my perspective, Solana is just now starting to fire on all cylinders and deliver on its early promise of being an \"Ethereum killer,\" while XRP seems to have taken several steps backward as the result of its long-running SEC court battle. If forced to choose between XRP and Solana, I'm picking Solana."

        "title": "The ripple effect of default payments on digital lenders - Fintech Nexus News",
        "content": "Digital lending platforms have emerged as financial industry game-changers, revolutionizing the way people access credit. These platforms offer unprecedented convenience and accessibility, helping make loans available at the click of a button.\n\nHowever, as with any innovation, there are potential pitfalls that could have far-reaching consequences. One pressing issue faced by digital lenders is the negative impact of default payments.\n\nA rise in delinquencies is happening across many loan types as consumer demand continues to stay strong despite rising prices. Currently, 2.1% of people who own a credit card are behind on their payments, and it\u2019s predicted this number will rise to 2.6% by the end of 2023. Delinquencies on unsecured personal loans will likely increase to 4.3%.\u00b9\n\nDefault payment impacts on digital lenders\n\nAlthough default payments could affect any financial institution, digital lending platforms face unique challenges due to their distinct infrastructure.\n\nLiquidity crunch: At the foundation of lending is having the available capital to lend to borrowers who then consistently make their loan payments. Default payments disrupt this balance. Funds that should have been reinvested in new loans are now unavailable, potentially stunting growth.\n\nErosion of capacity providers\u2019 confidence: Many digital lenders attract funding from capacity providers who expect consistent returns. Losses from default payments may lead to a dip in capacity providers\u2019 confidence \u2013 potentially impacting valuation and future funding prospects.\n\nImpact on interest rates and loan terms: To offset losses from default payments, lenders may need to raise interest rates, reduce the availability of certain loan products or impose stricter eligibility criteria, making it challenging for people to obtain loans.\n\nOperational challenges: Processing default payments requires time and effort. Resources that could have been devoted to improving user experience or developing better risk assessment may need to be allocated to manage the fallout from defaulting borrowers.\n\nFinancial strain on borrowers: Of course, defaulting on a loan could have serious consequences for borrowers. It may damage their credit scores and lead to increased stress, financial strain and potential legal actions. The initial relief from quick and simple borrowing could quickly turn into a heavy burden.\n\nRestrain the ripple effect\n\nWhile the negative impact of default payments is undeniable, digital lenders can take the following steps to help mitigate these challenges.\n\nLoan payment solutions: Incorporate loan payment protection as a component of the loan to help protect both borrowers and lenders from the risk of default.\n\nIncorporate loan payment protection as a component of the loan to help protect both borrowers and lenders from the risk of default. Flexible payment plans: Provide payment options or make special arrangements to help consumers who are experiencing financial hardship.\n\nProvide payment options or make special arrangements to help consumers who are experiencing financial hardship.

        "content": "Pea milk maker Ripple Foods has raised $49 million in a new round, taking its cumulative funding to more than $274 million.\n\nAccording to a November 29 SEC filing first reported by Forbes, Berkeley, California-based Ripple Foods has raised $49.2 million from a total offering of $55.4 million via a combination of equity, debt, and securities that can be obtained in the future through the exercise of an option or warrant.\n\nThe round follows a $60 million series E in late 2021 led by Rage Capital (now Bloom8), Ajax Strategies, and S2G Ventures; a $55.8 million series D in 2020; a $65 million series C in 2018; a $30 million series B in 2016; and a $13.6 million series A in 2015.\n\nRipple: More protein, less sugar\n\nRipple Foods was founded in late 2014 by Amyris cofounder Neil Renninger and Method household products cofounder Adam Lowry, who brought in former PepsiCo and Conagra exec Laura Flanagan to run the business as CEO in 2019, but still sit on the company\u2019s board.\n\nWhile several firms make milk from yellow peas, Ripple Foods claims to stand out from the crowd by\u200b\u200b \u200butilizing novel technology that strips out unwanted components (color/flavor) from commercially available plant protein isolates to yield \u2018Ripptein,\u2019 a neutral-tasting protein that can be incorporated into foods and beverages in high quantities.\n\nBy overcoming the sensory barriers, Ripple Foods has been able to dial up the protein (8g per 8oz serving) and dial down the sugar (6g per 8oz serving) to create an allergen-friendly (soy-, dairy-, nut-free) plant-based milk with half the sugar and 50% more calcium than 2% dairy milk and eight times the protein of almond milk, making it particularly attractive to households with children, claims the company.\n\nThe Ripple brand \u2013 which launched in early 2016 \u2013 is now sold in grocery stores across the US and has extended into protein shakes, kids\u2019 products, and half and half, although not everything it has touched has turned to CPG gold, notably plant-based yogurt and \u2018superfood\u2019 milks.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment on revenues or profitability, but CEO Laura Flanagan told AgFunderNews that Ripple Foods had had \u201ca very successful year, outpacing category growth as well as all other segments in 2023.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cRipple has the highest consumer loyalty in the category . Our Series F raise continues to fuel our momentum, with distribution expansion and blockbuster innovation like Ripple Kids.\u201d\n\nA press release issued in July said Ripple\u2019s kids\u2019 milk with added omega-3s had experienced \u201cexplosive growth,\u201d making it \u201cone of the fastest-growing products across all retail channels in the refrigerated plant-based milk category over the past year.\u201d\n\nThe evolving US plant-based milk market\n\nAccording to US retail data from SPINS for the 52 weeks to July 16, 2023, dollar sales of pea milk rose 17.3% year-over-year while unit sales rose 4.1%, outpacing the overall plant-based milk category, which posted a 7% increase in dollar sales and 5.4% drop in unit sales (SPINS: natural and conventional channels combined).\n\nIn the 12-weeks to July 16, however, dollar sales of pea milk were down 4.8% with units down 2.8%, while the overall category was down 3.9% in dollars and 4.5% in units.\n\nThe only major subsegment delivering growth in units sales over the 12-week period was shelf-stable coconut milk (+28.9%).\n\nFor context, unit sales of dairy milk\u2014which have been on a declining trajectory for years despite a brief blip during the pandemic\u2014fell -2.5% in the 12-week period and dropped -2.3% in the trailing 12 months.\n\nIn an October 12 note on publicly traded plant-based companies Beyond Meat, Oatly, and SunOpta (which makes plant-based milks for several leading CPG brands and retailers), Mizuho Securities managing director, equity research John Baumgartner said he was more bullish about plant-based milks than plant-based meats.\n\n\u201cFor plant-based beverages (PBBs), our survey suggests continued modest growth for the category in net buyers and total distribution points +2% year-over-year in the 12 weeks through September 9, 2023.
