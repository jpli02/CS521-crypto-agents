        "title": "Ripple (XRP) Dominates Ethereum (ETH) in Interest in Almost Every US State - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nGoogle Trends data shows that XRP is more popular than Ethereum in 47 US states, with the highest interest coming from Delaware, Nevada, Louisiana, Arizona, and Hawaii.\n\nXRP\u2019s price fluctuations throughout 2023 have been influenced by the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, with Ripple\u2019s partial wins in court contributing to a positive trend.\n\nForecasting the future value of XRP varies greatly among analysts, with estimates ranging from a moderate increase to $0.90 by next summer to an extreme prediction of $500, which would require a market capitalization far exceeding the current total crypto market cap.\n\nAmericans are Interested in Ripple (XRP)\n\nRipple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 seems to be a highly intriguing topic for many Americans. According to Google Trends data, the residents of 47 states have displayed higher interest in the asset than Ethereum (ETH).\n\nDelaware, Nevada, Louisiana, Arizona, and Hawaii are the regions where XRP is the most popular. On the other hand, Vermont, New York, Oregon, and the District of Columbia are the only areas where Ethereum has surpassed Ripple\u2019s coin.\n\nXRP\u2019s price has gone through numerous ups and downs since the beginning of 2023, experiencing a significant uptrend in the second half of the year. The positive performance could be a result of the developments surrounding the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, specifically the three partial wins that the blockchain enterprise has secured so far.\n\nThe outcome of the legal battle, which has been ongoing since December 2020, is expected to be revealed in the spring of 2024 during a grand trial. Multiple analysts and experts have predicted that a decisive win for Ripple could propel a further jump for XRP.\n\nSome of the XRP Forecasts\n\nThe popular X (Twitter) user CrediBULL argued that the asset\u2019s valuation could rise to approximately $0.90 by the summer of next year.\n\nWhile such a prediction sounds somewhat realistic, other analysts, like Shannon Thorp, have envisioned astronomical increases. She assumed that XRP could explode to $500 in the following years.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the coin\u2019s market capitalization should spike to over $250 trillion for this to happen. In comparison, the entire market cap of the sector was \u201cjust\u201d $3 trillion in 2021 when many digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), charted all-time highs.\n\nThose curious to check how high XRP could shoot in the remaining months of the ongoing year could take a look at the video below:"

        "title": "Crypto lawyer John Deaton believes Ripple has 90% chance of winning SEC lawsuit - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Well-known crypto attorney John Deaton believes that the SEC only has a 10% chance of winning its dispute with Ripple, with 90% odds in the company\u2019s favor.\n\nDeaton said that a settlement of $20 million or less would represent a significant legal triumph for Ripple, a sentiment echoed by many in the crypto community.\n\nRipple vs. SEC\n\nThe lawsuit, which the SEC initiated against Ripple Labs in December 2020, alleged that the company conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling its native token, XRP.\n\nHowever, the case has evolved significantly in recent months, when Judge Analisa Torres determined that XRP was not a security when traded on the secondary market. Moreover, the charges against Ripple executives were reduced along the way.\n\nDeaton\u2019s recent comments were prompted by a post from Ripple\u2019s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, who highlighted that the SEC faced a recent defeat in the case of the SEC versus Govil, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the SEC cannot request a substantial disgorgement award without first demonstrating actual financial harm to investors.\n\nIn essence, the ruling implies that if there\u2019s no harm, there\u2019s no penalty.\n\n90% chance of win\n\nDeaton strongly refuted that the lawsuit\u2019s outcome was an even 50/50 for the SEC, contending that it\u2019s closer to a 90/10 advantage in favor of Ripple. His assessment resonates with the sentiment in the crypto community, which generally views a suggested $20 million settlement as a favorable resolution for Ripple.\n\nThe ongoing legal battles have brought Ripple and the SEC to the forefront of discussions in the crypto space. The uncertainty surrounding the legal status of XRP and other digital currencies has left many in the industry closely following the developments in this case.\n\nIn a related development, Judge Analisa Torres recently approved an order regarding the SEC and Ripple\u2019s joint request to propose a briefing schedule to address institutional sales of XRP. This aspect of the lawsuit pertains to the segment in which Ripple was determined to have breached securities laws.\n\nBoth parties have been instructed to provide a joint briefing schedule no later than Nov. 9, suggesting that further developments in the case are on the horizon.\n\nThe case also serves as a significant reference point for the broader regulatory environment for digital currencies as the industry navigates evolving legal interpretations and regulations.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nXRP holders' attorney and CryptoLaw founder, John Deaton, has outlined a scenario that would lead to a 99.9% win for Ripple in the SEC lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a tweet, Deaton argues that claims that the SEC got a 50-50 victory in the Ripple case were wrong. He goes on to say that the outcome was more like 90-10 in Ripple's favor, which would amount to a 99.9% legal victory if Ripple ends up paying $20 million or less as penalties.\n\nThe people who\u2019ve argued that the SEC got a 50-50 victory in the @Ripple case are \ud83d\udcaf wrong. It was more like 90-10 in Ripple\u2019s favor. If Ripple ends up paying $20M or less it\u2019s a 99.9% legal victory. https://t.co/Xe6SYBiTCJ \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) November 4, 2023\n\nDeaton said this in response to Ripple general counsel Stuart Alderoty's tweet highlighting the SEC's loss in the Govil case, in which the 2nd Circuit ruled that the SEC could not seek crippling disgorgement without first establishing that \"investors\" suffered actual financial harm.\n\nLegal attorney and XRP enthusiast Jeremy Hogan pointed out the significance of this argument as the Ripple SEC lawsuit is presently in the \"damages\" phase. Hogan implies that this means that XRP holders would need to have suffered losses for Ripple to be liable.\n\nAs the Ripple SEC lawsuit progresses, the next key date could be Nov. 9, 2023, when the parties are expected to jointly propose a briefing schedule about remedies. The SEC and Ripple are likely to meet before this date to discuss a potential briefing schedule for which remedies are appropriate against Ripple for Section 5 violations related to its institutional sales of XRP.\n\nNo settlement talks, no IPO, John Deaton says\n\nIn a separate tweet, Deaton quells two \"unpopular\" opinions. First, there are no current or ongoing settlement talks between Ripple and the SEC; and second, Ripple has zero plans of issuing an IPO before June 2024.\n\nIt should be recalled that on Oct. 23, an order was signed officially by Judge Torres dismissing the case against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen.\n\nThe voluntary dismissal obviates the need for the scheduled trial on the claim against the Ripple defendants and thus moots an earlier scheduling order, which included that the SEC and Ripple discuss settlement before the pretrial conference.\n\nAlso, chances of an IPO are slim, as the SEC must approve Ripple's S-1 before going public, which may not happen at the moment due to the ongoing lawsuit."

        "content": "An intravitreal sustained-release dexamethasone implant, IBE-814 IVT, improved vision and reduced treatment burden among patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or diabetic macular edema (DME), according to new 6-month results from the first-in-human phase 2 RIPPLE-1 trial.\n\nThe 6-month data, presented at the 127th Annual American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) Meeting in San Francisco, California, showed all patient cohorts experienced a reduction in central subfield thickness (CST) and improvement or stabilization of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).\n\n\u201cThe promise for patients is really the reduction in the treatment burden, because one thing they hate the most is how frequently they need to come in for injections,\u201d Sumit Sharma, MD, an assistant professor of ophthalmology, Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland Clinic, told HCPLive. \u201cAnytime we can reduce that with an adjunctive therapy, it\u2019s helpful. I don\u2019t think this would ever be a first-line therapy, but I do think it would be something to consider for patients who\u2019ve had anti-VEGF and still have fluid or require very frequent treatment.\u201d\n\nThe IBE-814 intravitreal implant is performed with a 30-gauge needle with a 6-mm implant, an advantage over a 22g x 6mm commercial dexamethasone implant. The implant has improved durability of 6\u20139 months and the smaller needle size is less invasive for patients.\n\nThe RIPPLE-1 study was the first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the IBE-814 intravitreal implant at 21 clinics across 4 countries. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of DME or RVO, age \u226545 years, visual acuity 20/40 to 20/320 (Snellen), and treatment-naive or previously treated.\n\nPatients were randomized to receive either the low-dose (single 70 \u00b5g implant) or high-dose (2 x 70 \u00b5g implant) implants at baseline. Patients were followed weekly and then monthly, with retreatment eligibility based on prespecified retreatment criteria between months 5 and 12. A safety follow-up was performed for up to 18 months.\n\nThe RVO cohort included 10 patients in the low-dose cohort and 15 patients in the high-dose cohort; the DME cohort included 23 patients in the low-dose group and 12 patients in the high-dose cohort. Subjects were primarily phakic, particularly in the RVO cohort, and there was a mixture of treatment-naive and prior-treated subjects in the RVO and DME cohorts.\n\nAt 6 months, among patients with RVO, the mean change in CST was \u2013148 \u00b5m in the high-dose cohort and \u2013188 \u00b5m in the low-dose cohort. Changes in BCVA showed an improvement of +6.4 letters in the high-dose cohort and +5.5 letters in the high-dose cohort. A total of 2 patients in the low-dose cohort and 3 patients in the high-dose cohort required rescue.\n\nFor patients with DME, 6-month results showed a mean change in CST of \u201368\u00b5m in the low-dose cohort and \u201394\u00b5m in the high-dose cohort. The corresponding mean change in BCVA showed a difference, with a gain of +8.7 letters in the high-dose cohort and a loss of \u20131.9 letters in the low-dose cohort. However, Sharma noted that 8 patients in the low-dose cohort required rescue treatment, compared to only 1 in the high-dose cohort.\n\nSafety data were consistent with other intravitreal steroids, with no serious ocular adverse events identified in the 6 months of study. Sharma noted a low rate of cataract formation in the first 6 months and no patient required surgical intervention for intraocular pressure (IOP).\n\nThere were no IOP elevations in the low-dose RVO group and all other subjects with IOP elevations required only eye drops for control, Sharma noted. The treatment burden was additionally reduced with IBE-814 intravitreal treatment.\n\nPatients with RVO in the low-dose and high-dose cohort achieved a reduction in treatment burden of \u201376% and \u201388%, respectively. Patients with DME in the low-dose and high-dose cohorts achieved a reduction in treatment burden of \u201357% and \u201373%, respectively. Sharma noted approximately 67% to 100% of patients experienced a reduction in the treatment burden and an increase in visual acuity, depending on the dose cohort and disease status.\n\nFor more insight into the analysis, watch the full interview with Dr. Sharma.\n\nReferences\n\nIntravitreal Sustained-Release Dexamethasone Implant for Diabetic Macular Edema and RVO: Six-Month Results From the First-in-Human Phase 2 RIPPLE-1 Trial.
