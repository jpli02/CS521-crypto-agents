        "content": "The ripple case was a case that for example, there's a lot of focus this year because the SEC actually lost in a high profile case. And I think what a lot of people are wondering is, what does this mean? Does this mean that the SEC is going to roll out some regulations? Does this mean we're finally going to get a regulatory framework in the United States for crypto? And the answer I think is no, the SEC did dismiss some of the cases but they're appealing and they are trying to before they've continued their aggressive approach. I think we're gonna see more of what people call regulation by enforcement from the SEC where they're fighting in court, not criminal cases, but civil cases against companies with a legitimate companies that are actually interested in being compliant and trying to figure out what regulatory uh framework would be? And unfortunately, I think we still have go, we're gonna have uncertainty in 2024 and that may not clear up for some time."

        "content": "Ripple\u2019s XRP token has faced a sharp correction over the last few days. XRP is currently down by 1.9% in the daily charts, 8.6% in the weekly charts, and 19% since the previous month. However, since January 2023, the token\u2019s price has surged by around 63%.\n\nHowever, Ripple\u2019s XRP is not the only cryptocurrency in the red. Most significant altcoins have faced a correction in a market-wide liquidation spree. Cardano (ADA) has dropped 18% in the weekly charts, while Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) have fallen by over 14% in the same time frame. Chainlink (LINK) has dropped by over 10%, and Solana (SOL) by over 12% over the previous week.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple: Will XRP Reclaim its All-Time High of $3.40 in 2024?\n\nHowever, despite the recent correction, analysts still predict a bullish outlook for XRP.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP to rally 1900% to $7\n\nSource \u2013 Bitcoin.com\n\nAccording to known crypto proponent Ben Armstrong, XRP could reach $7 in a bull market. If XRP reaches $7, it would translate to a growth of over 1900% from current levels. Moreover, Armstrong says that the figures may not be the peak for XRP, suggesting that the popular asset could go even higher than $7.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple: Expert Predicts 2350% Rally for XRP, Could Reach $14\n\nAccording to Armstrong, XRP\u2019s rise to $7 could be in tandem with Ripple\u2019s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). The analyst anticipates significant excitement around the IPO, which could lead to a price surge.\n\nFurthermore, Armstrong also believes that an Ethereum (ETH) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) could further aid XRP\u2019s price. According to the analyst, after a spot ETH ETF, market participants would look for the next big crypto for an ETF, which could be XRP.\n\nFurthermore, if the crypto markets enter a bull run, we may see a new all-time high for Ripple\u2019s XRP. Moreover, if the US high court rules favorably for Ripple in the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), it may further push the asset\u2019s price."

        "content": "Ripple-backed network XRP Ledger (XRPL) is experiencing a surge in network activity described as a distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack by Magnetic X, a decentralized exchange based on the network.\n\nAccording to the DEX, the network has been hit with a massive spike in daily transactions from hundreds of accounts, disrupting its functionality and impeding its speed. Notably, since Dec. 28, the network has seen an average of 5 million transactions and the attackers are burning as much as 5000 XRP in network fees daily.\n\n\u201c[The attacker] strategy is simple: hundreds (maybe thousands) of different wallets are sending 0.000001 XRP to this wallet: rxRpSNb1VktvzBz8JF2oJC6qaww6RZ7Lw. It is unclear what their motive is. Whether Ripple themselves are testing their blockchain or ill-wishers decided to bring down the network,\u201d Magnetic X added.\n\nA look at the wallet on the XRP blockchain explorer platform Bithomp showed that it has been tagged as fraudulent, and the wallet continues to receive XRP deposits. The wallet holds over 11,000 units of XRP worth around $6400 as of press time.\n\nHowever, Mayukha Vadari, a Senior Software Developer at XRPL, countered the perception of an attack. He said the surge resulted from increased and potentially fraudulent inscription trading activity within the network.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a (somewhat scammy) project selling inscriptions on the XRPL and their website creates a bunch of new accounts for each person so they can spam more.,\u201d he explained.\n\nMeanwhile, XRPScan data confirms that the network is witnessing an upsurge in its activity, with Ledger surpassing 5 million active accounts earlier today.\n\nNodes impacted\n\nThe continued \u201cattack\u201d adversely impacted Magnetic X\u2019s nodes on Jan. 6, causing them to overload and slow down.\n\nConsequently, certain applications on the platform experienced disruptions in accessing transaction histories and network updates.\n\n\u201cWe have been diligently working on optimizing the code, adjusting node configurations, and procuring additional resources. The problem has now been resolved,\u201d it added.\n\nNevertheless, the exchange highlighted the potential ramifications for network users and developers, foreseeing slower node operations and increased network fees due to the attack. Magnetic X further raised concerns about the XRP Ledger\u2019s ability to manage substantial transaction volumes. It said: \u201cIf issues like these arise at 60-70 tx/s, what will happen at 1500 tx/s? While very powerful validator and blockchain explorer nodes will likely withstand such a load, what will happen to public nodes or nodes with limited capacities (due to the owners\u2019 inability to afford them)?\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn new tweets, Ripple CTO David Schwartz unveils a surprising truth about the company's XRP holdings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRipple's holdings fall into two categories: XRP, which it currently has available in its wallets, and XRP, which is subject to on-ledger escrow lockups that will be released over the coming months.\n\nRipple does not have access to the latter category of XRP until the escrow releases it monthly. The vast majority of this XRP released has been returned to escrow in the past.\n\n... We tried a variety of other things such as sales with lockups and using XRP to incentivize partners. And what we discovered was that everything that worked with more or less no different from selling XRP. ... \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 8, 2024\n\nResponding to a tweet by X user \"Mr Huber\" on Ripple's XRP distribution, Schwartz highlights the possibilities presented to Ripple as regards its XRP holdings.\n\nAccording to him, Ripple has two choices: to continue to hold as much XRP as it does now or to reduce its holdings of XRP. He went on to say that there is no third option.\n\nRipple's original plan was to reduce its XRP holdings as rapidly as possible, Schwartz stated. He went on to say that he cannot think of any series of events that would make this initial idea even remotely likely. Even if it happens, Schwartz believes that it might not have any real benefits.\n\nSchwartz went on to say that the initial plan was to primarily use giveaways to lower its XRP supply. He noted that once XRP had a market price, people would spend money to game the giveaways, so it had to stop.\n\nRipple also explored some other things, such as sales with lockups and utilizing XRP to incentivize partners. It was discovered that everything that worked was essentially the same as selling XRP.\n\nRipple, according to Schwartz, is more than ten years into its five-year plan and is nearly halfway there.\n\nResponding to users' questions about escrow or even burning the supply in escrow, Schwartz remarked that he was not sure the escrow was such a good idea and, hence, stayed on the fence.\n\nThe Ripple CTO also waived off the idea of burning the escrow supply, implying that it might not have the desired effect."

        "title": "Ripple Effects of Contentious California Water Utility Ratemaking Decisions - FactSet Insight",
        "content": "California has been a leader of conservation-promoting rate design in utilities for over 40 years. Beginning with the decoupling of gas and electric rates in the early 80s and water rates in 2008, the tradition of incentivizing conservation at the regulatory level has been a cornerstone to the functionality of California utilities, inspiring other states to adopt decoupled rates as well. However, recent decisions by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to discontinue full decoupling have jeopardized these mechanisms, threatening to redefine how utilities function in an environment plagued with record drought conditions, extreme weather, and economic hardship.\n\nDecoupling \u2013 Why do we care?\n\nGenerally, decoupling is defined as a utility ratemaking mechanism that severs the dependency of revenues from actual sales. Across the nation, this has been executed in various ways from weather normalization mechanisms to conservation riders that provide reimbursement for lost revenue due to utility-sponsored conservation programs. California was the first to implement a more robust approach that completely divorced revenues from sales, allowing the utility to be kept financially whole while actively promoting reduced sales of its primary commodity. Additionally, this full decoupling protects the utility from other variances, such as extreme weather, drought, rolling black-outs, economic downturn, utility theft, and incorrect metering conditions, among others. Having this robust mechanism suddenly stripped away from water utilities begs the questions: 1) Will the Commission terminate full decoupling for electric and gas next? 2) Will other states follow California\u2019s lead?\n\nFactSet closely follows the regulatory environment of electric and gas utilities throughout the United States and has recently published a report on Differentiated Ratemaking. This report offers a comparison of ratemaking mechanisms (including decoupling) used by both gas and electric utilities as protection against a variety of necessary financial threats. However, trends in Commission policy often overlap between sectors, as decisions made for one regulated industry can sometimes predict precedents for others. FactSet believes many unique insights can be discovered from a comprehensive dataset derived not only from energy utilities, but water as well. Significant Commission decisions from a trend-setting state like California can potentially have cascading effects that permeate the nation\u2019s regulatory industry across all sectors.\n\nConservation, Pilot Programs, and Water\n\nIn 2020, the CPUC voted to eliminate a decade-long pilot program originally intended to promote conservation. The pilot program weighed the merits between two styles of decoupling mechanisms. The first, which mimics the widely accepted decoupling procedure used by California electric companies to fully divorce revenues from actual sales, was the Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM) with a Modified Cost Balancing Account (MCBA). The second, which is still allowable by the CPUC but provides less protection for the utility, is the Monterey-Style WRAM (M-WRAM) with an Incremental Cost Balancing Account (ICBA).\n\nDecoupling was first introduced to water utilities in 2008. As drought conditions worsened, it became necessary for water utilities to actively promote conservation. The WRAM/MCBA allows the company to collect its required revenues for fixed costs regardless of actual sales, which allows a utility to remain financially whole while actively promoting the disuse of its own product. Rates are calculated based on a sales forecast and a revenue requirement approved by the CPUC in a General Rate Case (GRC) application. Revenues from actual sales are recorded in the MCBA and any over-collection or under-collections are passed through to the customers via WRAM surcharge, which is regularly adjusted. While this effectively protects the company from lost revenues due to conservation efforts, it also shifts the risk of extreme weather conditions and economic downturn from the company to the customers.\n\nThe M-WRAM/ICBA achieves decoupling differently by setting a baseline water usage for each customer class and using a tiered rate structure to charge a premium for consumption over the baseline usage. Differences in revenues are calculated by comparing actual revenues to those which would have been collected without tiered rates.\n\nAlthough M-WRAM does much less to protect the utility from lost revenues, the CPUC favored M-WRAM over WRAM, stating that there was not a noticeable difference in the level of conservation achieved between the two mechanisms and, therefore, the WRAM was not achieving its intended purpose. In the Commission\u2019s order, water utilities were prohibited from proposing continuation of full WRAM decoupling in their next GRC application, while proposals of M-WRAM would still be considered.\n\nWhere We Are Now & What Happens Next\u2026\n\nThe California water companies have since requested a rehearing (denied by the CPUC), petitioned the Supreme Court of California for a writ of review (petitions have been combined, but the case is still open), and even lobbied for legislation to be passed that would permanently bring decoupling back to the water companies. On August 29, 2022, the governor of California signed Senate Bill 1469, which requires the CPUC to consider authorizing water decoupling mechanisms.\n\nCalifornia American Water (Cal-Am) requested consideration of a WRAM in its GRC application filed on July 1, 2022 (A. 22-07-001). The CPUC\u2019s response noted that while legislation requires consideration of a WRAM, it gives the \u201c\u2026Commission discretion as to whether or not to grant the WRAM,\u201d and asked Cal-Am to re-file its application to reflect WRAM as an alternative to M-WRAM.\n\nThis has since sparked commotion with other companies that have so far unsuccessfully attempted to obtain party-status in the Cal-Am GRC proceeding to weigh in on the topic.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, Cal-Am filed its updated application. Instead of comparing WRAM to M-WRAM, an argument already considered by the CPUC, Cal-Am opted to design an entirely new decoupling mechanism called the Water Resources Sustainability Plan (WRSP) with the Essential Service Balancing Account (ESBA) to manage any over/under collection of the WRSP. In addition to the ESBA, the WRSP includes various mechanisms that more frequently update the sales forecasts, adjust amortization, and allow for rate-design modifications. These various moving parts both allow the utility to promote conservation and maintain lesser over/under collected balances.\n\nGiven California\u2019s reputation as a leader in conservation-oriented rate design, FactSet will be monitoring this case and any subsequent fallout closely.\n\nThis blog post is for informational purposes only.
