        "title": "Crypto Analysts Predict XRP Price Rally Against BTC - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Market analysts are watching Ripple\u2019s XRP for a potential price surge against the world\u2019s leading digital currency, Bitcoin.\n\nXRP, known for its lightning-fast transaction speed and secure blockchain technology, has recently experienced a rollercoaster ride due to its lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nHowever, an XRP and BTC chartist, Cryptoes, predicts a trend reversal for XRP based on current indicators on the chart.\n\nAnalysts See A Pump In XRP Price Against Bitcoin\n\nThe performance of XRP since the beginning of April has been very low compared to that of Bitcoin. This led to a notable decline in the XRP/BTC pair over the last five weeks.\n\nIts poor performance does not affect how certain analysts picture the token. The positive view of XRP\u2019s price can be attributed to a key support level at its current position.\n\nCryptoes called crypto enthusiasts\u2019 attention to this occurrence in a tweet, revealing that the weekly chart of the XRP/BTC pair projects a major support level. The chart revealed that XRP\u2019s price had slowed against Bitcoin\u2019s since April 3.\n\nHowever, the support level could prevent further decline of XRP tokens as it might be the bottom point. He added that the token might consolidate for weeks before initiating a rally.\n\nAnother popular crypto analyst, Egrag, has a different view from Cryptoes. According to him, the market currently projects a bearish trend.\n\nHis reason is hinged on the movements of two Simple Moving Averages (SMA), the 20 and 100 moving averages on the same chart.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Loses Grip On $1,800: Will The Bulls Barge In To Save The Day? 1 year ago\n\nAccording to Egrag, the 20 Simple Moving Averages (SMA) place sell pressure on the coin\u2019s price. As such, the 100-moving average is a strong resistance against the current price of XRP. It could be difficult for the token to break out from such resistance.\n\nHe believes that the presence of these indicators signals market weakness, and XRP could yield to them. But time will tell if XRP will pump to close above the falling wage.\n\nXRP\u2019s Recent Price Performance\n\nThere is no significant difference between XRP\u2019s price at the beginning of May and its current price of $0.4286. On May 1, the coin was trading around the $0.47 price mark, which eventually declined to $0.465 at the close of the day.\n\nIt maintained this price range between $0.45 and $0.46 over the next seven days and dipped slightly to $0.4186 on May 8. Since then, it has been hovering around the $0.41 and $0.42 price levels.\n\nIn the past seven days, it has declined by 7.25%. However, its 24-hour price trades sideways at the time of writing, while the trading volume and market cap have also increased by 18.45% and 1.93%.\n\n-Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Fishing in Sword & Shield is pretty simple and straightforward as compared to other games in the franchise, you don\u2019t even have to wait a while to get a fishing rod this time in the game. The only thing you need to be mindful of is timing. You get the ability to fish as soon as you acquire the camping set during your first visit to the wild area. We have compiled the perfect Pokemon Sword and Shield Fishing Guide for you to start catching some fish.\n\nPokemon Sword and Shield Fishing\n\nAs soon as you get to your home town and get the camping gear, head to the nearest place with water. That would be the Professor\u2019s house. If you see a shadow underwater with a ripple, it\u2019s most likely a Pokemon. You can just stand near the water\u2019s edge and start fishing.\n\nYou can even go on the water with your bike to pick up items and go a bit deeper but avoid doing that as it will scare the Pokemon away and you won\u2019t be able to catch them.\n\nOnce you reach the ripple, face it and press A to cast the line. Be patient and only reel it in once you feel it shaking. As soon as you see a \u201c!\u201d above your head, hit A again to start reeling it in. This happens instantaneously so if you miss the cue, you\u2019ll lose your catch.\n\nIf you land the button press on time, you have to fight the Pokemon before you can properly catch it. Weaken it but don\u2019t knock it out. Just get it vulnerable enough for you to throw the Pokeball at it and voila! You\u2019ve caught yourself a water Pokemon!\n\nWhile technically you have the Fishing Rod in your Key Items from the start of the game, you can\u2019t fish till you reach proper water bodies in the Wild Area. After that, you can basically fish anywhere you spot bubbles and ripples in water.\n\nYou can even fish in large cities like Motostoke if you are tired of fishing in the wild."
