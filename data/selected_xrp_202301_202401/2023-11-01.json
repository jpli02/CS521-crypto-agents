        "content": "Ripple recently released its latest quarterly report on the XRP market, revealing that it sold over 892 million XRP in Q3 2023, as its current holdings hit 46.5 billion XRP, with 41.3 billion of these tokens inaccessible.\n\nNotably, as part of its routine process, Ripple emphasized the segregation of its entire XRP holdings into two categories. The first category pertains to the XRP in the company\u2019s corporate accounts, which serves as a readily accessible balance the firm can spend at will for operations.\n\nHowever, the second category pertains to XRP tokens that the company holds in its escrow wallets. These XRP tokens in Ripple\u2019s escrow wallets are inaccessible. The company can only gain access to them upon the escrow release, which sees 1 billion tokens unlocked every month.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis indicates that the escrow algorithm released 3 billion XRP in the third quarter of the year. However, Ripple locks back most of the tokens released monthly, as disclosed in the latest quarterly report. For instance, it locked back 800 million XRP in October and August.\n\nRipple Sold 892M XRP in Q3 2023\n\nThe report stressed that Ripple held a total of 47.45 billion XRP at the end of the second quarter of this year, specifically on June 30. Of this figure, the firm held 5.55 billion XRP as its spendable balance and 41.9 billion tokens in escrow wallets.\n\nThese figures have changed since June 30. Notably, the firm now held a total of 46.5 billion XRP as of Sept. 30, the end of the third quarter. Of this figure, 5.25 billion XRP represents the company\u2019s spendable balance, down from 5.55 billion on June 30. This shows that Ripple sold 293 million XRP from its spendable balance in Q3 2023.\n\nAdditionally, of the total 46.5 billion Ripple held as of Sept. 30, the tokens in escrow wallets amounted to 41.3 billion, down from the 41.9 billion figure on June 30. Interestingly, this adjustment represents a drop of 600 million XRP tokens from July to September 2023. In total, Ripple sold 892 million XRP in Q3 2023.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP Movements in Q3\n\nThe Crypto Basic has repeatedly called attention to some of these selloffs amid multiple whale movements from Ripple. In one of the latest reports, The Crypto Basic confirmed that Ripple moved over 506 million XRP over 14 transactions from Sept. 3 to 18.\n\nMoreover, in August, the company transferred 31 million XRP tokens to an unidentified wallet. Interestingly, XRP was recording an impressive price uptick during this transaction. Most movements saw the tokens enter the crypto exchange Bitstamp, with selloff concerns emerging.\n\nThe amount sold in the third quarter exceeds that of the previous quarter. Recall that The Crypto Basic confirmed in July that Ripple has continued to increase its XRP sales over the past few months as it looks to reduce its holdings systemically."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nXRP has been making waves with its meteoric ascent in the month of October, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing down as November unfolds.\n\nSince October 19, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped securities-violations charges against fintech company Ripple\u2019s top leaders, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency has continued to gain.\n\nNotably, the broader cryptocurrency market has been closely following the lead of Bitcoin (BTC) as optimism about institutional adoption and the imminent approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in the U.S. grows.\n\nThat said, one key indicator of XRP\u2019s bullish sentiment to the $3 price is the increasing involvement of whales in the market. On Wednesday, on-chain analytics firm Santiment tweeted;\n\n\u201cXRP revisited a $0.60 market value for the first time since its tumble back on August 16th. Along this road back, we have seen whales get gradually more involved. Additionally, there are now an all-time high of 277.62K wallets holding at least 10K XRP.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis suggests growing interest from large holders, often indicating confidence in the cryptocurrency\u2019s future.\n\nFurther evidence of increasing whale accumulation is visible on the XRP Ledger, with large XRP transactions observed recently. Today, Whale Alert reported that 30 million XRP tokens were moved from Bybit to an unknown wallet, while another 50 million XRP tokens were transferred from Crypto.com to an unknown wallet on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, this XRP price surge coincided with Ripple unlocking over 1 billion XRP from escrow, valued at around $600 million earlier today. The implications of this are significant for XRP\u2019s price and Ripple\u2019s strategic plans. Notably, Ripple may choose to sell the newly released XRP on exchanges, increasing the supply and potentially putting downward pressure on the price while raising capital for its operations and investments.\n\nAlternatively, Ripple might opt to hold the unlocked XRP in reserve, giving them flexibility to use it at a later date without affecting short-term pricing. Some of the unlocked XRP could also be used as liquidity incentives for market makers, potentially improving trading volume and price stability.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s worth noting that these scenarios are speculative, and Ripple\u2019s actual plans with the unlocked funds remain unknown. Nonetheless, the scale of these unlocked funds provides Ripple with considerable flexibility, and their decisions will surely have a significant impact on XRP\u2019s volatile price.\n\nIn the meantime, investors maintain their confidence in XRP\u2019s ability to maintain its position above the crucial 200-day moving average (DMA) support, even after it was breached last week. This resilience, coupled with the breakout from the $0.47-$0.54 range that had confined it for about two months, could serve as a launching pad for further price gains.\n\nAt press time, XRP was trading at $0.6036, reflecting a 4.8% surge over the past 24 hours."
