        "content": "In this article SIVB Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nSilicon Valley Bank's collapse could have ramifications for the technology landscape over the coming years, analysts and investors said. Nikolas Liepins | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was the backbone of many startups and venture capital funds around the world. The effects of its collapse, the biggest banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis, is likely to be felt across the technology landscape globally over the coming years. \"With SVB in essence the Godfather of the Silicon Valley banking ecosystem for the past few decades in the tech world, we believe the negative ripple impact of this historical collapse will have a myriad of implications for the tech world going forward,\" Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Tuesday. SVB's collapse began last week when it said it needed to raise $2.25 billion to shore up its balance sheet. Venture capital firms told their portfolio companies to withdraw money from the bank and other clients looked to get their cash before it became unobtainable. This effectively led to a bank run. The bank had to sell assets, mainly bonds, at a massive loss. U.S. regulators shut down SVB on Friday and took control of its deposits. Regulators then said Sunday that depositors at SVB would have access to their money, in a move aimed at stopping further contagion. But the episode has the potential to impact the technology world in several ways, from making it harder for startups to raise funds to forcing firms to change their business model, according to investors and analysts who spoke to CNBC.\n\n'Last thing we needed'\n\nSVB was critical to the growth of the technology industry, not just in the U.S. but in places like Europe and even China. The 40-year old institution had an intimate link to the technology world offering traditional banking services as well as funding companies that were deemed too risky for traditional lenders. SVB also provided other services like credit lines and lines to startups. When times were good, SVB thrived. But over the past year, the U.S. Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates, hurting the once high-flying technology sector. The funding environment has got harder for startups in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. SVB's collapse has come at an already difficult time for startup investors. \"This whole Silicon Valley Bank thing is the last thing we needed and was completely unexpected,\" Ben Harburg, managing partner of Beijing, China-based venture capital fund MSA Capital, told CNBC.\n\nwatch now\n\nStartups have had to tighten their belt while technology giants have axed tens of thousands of workers in a bid to cut costs. In such an environment, SVB played a key role in providing credit lines or other instruments that allowed startups to pay their employees or ride out hard times. \"Silicon Valley Bank was very paternalistic to this sector, they not only provided payroll services, loans to founders against their illiquid credit, but lines of credit as well. And a lot of these companies were having trouble already raising equity and they were counting on those lines to extend their runway, to push out the cash burn beyond the recession we all expect.\" Matt Higgins, CEO of RSE Ventures, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Tuesday. \"That evaporated overnight and there's not another lender that's going to be stepping in to fill those shoes.\" Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at EY, told CNBC on Monday that a crypto firm called POAP, which is run by his friend, has half of the company's money tied up in SVB and can't get it out. The amount at SVB is \"more than payroll can cover.\" Patricio Worthalter, founder of POAP, told CNBC that the company had a \"substantially high amount\" of its treasury in SVB and has managed to retrieve 50%. However, payroll was \"never at risk\" and the company has \"solid credit lines to tap into\" if required, the founder added.\n\nThe SVB collapse will also likely put the focus on startups to pivot to profitability and be more disciplined with their spending. \"Companies will have to reboot the way they think about their business,\" Adam Singolda, CEO of Taboola, told CNBC's \"Last Call\" on Monday.\n\nwatch now"

        "title": "Silicon Valley Bank collapse ripples across space industry - Space.com",
        "content": "Rocket Lab, whose Electron launcher is seen here on its Virginia pad, is among the space companies that did business with Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), an institution involved in investment, loans and traditional banking services for many technology companies, could have ripple effects across the space industry.\n\nThe California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation announced the closure of SVB on Friday (March 10), also revealing that the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as the receiver for the bank.\n\n\"All insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, March 13, 2023,\" the department's statement read . \"The FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week.\"\n\nRelated: How to launch a space startup in 2 days (first person)\n\nAmong the space sector companies that could be affected is Rocket Lab, which SpaceNews reported has an aggregate balance of around $38 million with the California-headquartered SVB. This represents 7.9% of the company's total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nSVB had become the bank of choice for many startup tech companies, thanks to its deeper understanding of the circumstances faced by those companies in comparison to other banks. SVB was in especially high demand during the COVID pandemic; the initial market shock of the pandemic led to a boom period for startups and established tech providers, thanks to consumers increasing spending on gadgets and digital services.\n\nIn the space sector, Astra, Planet, Redwire and Rocket Lab all received loans from SVB and repaid that money when they went public via mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, SpaceNews reported, citing annual reports by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIn public, companies with SVB accounts have generally been reassuring investors that the current situation is manageable.\n\n\"We think the steps taken by the Fed, Treasury and (The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) will decisively break the psychological 'doom loop' across the regional banking sector,\" Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto, told Reuters .\n\nIn private, however, some were less sanguine, SpaceNews reported.\n\n\"It's a very serious situation. Our balance is suddenly only $450,\" an unidentified space sector entrepreneur told SpaceNews. \"There has been no communication from SVB even after the event became known. Our primary SVB liaison, who has been very attentive in the past, is unreachable by any means. It's appalling.\"\n\nThe entrepreneur's company kept its balance below the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit, but they don't know when they'll regain access to their money or how the regulatory processes will be coordinated, which the source said is \"critical to international aerospace work.\"\n\n\"I can only imagine the state of mind for startups that had their equity fundraising or revenue monies in SVB,\" the entrepreneur told SpaceNews. \"That's likely well over the outdated $250,000 FDIC limit. How will they even make payroll this week, much less carry on operations?\"\n\nFormer Momentus Space vice president of business development Negar Feher told SpaceNews that SVB's closure likely won't affect the space ecosystem over the long haul. But, Feher said, \"it could heavily affect some startups' cash flow in the near terms as they struggle to get their assets out.\"\n\nYou can read the full SpaceNews story here .\n\nThe collapse of SVB, a bank that was born in the heart of Silicon Valley four decades ago, began on Wednesday (March 8), when it announced a $1.75 billion raising of capital. The bank told investors it needed to plug a hole caused by the sale of some of its bonds to offset a lack of on-hand cash, The Guardian reported , but this triggered a rush of demand from customers who were concerned that SVB was short of capital and began drawing out money en masse.\n\nTwo days later, on March 10, SVB \u2014 valued at $200 billion \u2014 collapsed, in the biggest bank failure in the U.S. since the global financial crisis in 2008.\n\nThe FDIC said that the main office and all branches of Silicon Valley Bank will reopen on Monday (March 13). SVB has 17 branches in California and Massachusetts.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Spacedotcom or Facebook."
