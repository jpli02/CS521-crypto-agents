        "title": "Maker's MKR Meteoric Surge: $1B Inflows, 8% DAI Yield, & DeFi's Ripple Effect - TronWeekly",
        "content": "In a dynamic market, Maker\u2019s governance token, $MKR, has emerged as a shining star, witnessing an astonishing price surge of over 100% in the last three months. Notably, Intotheblock\u2019s data analysis has revealed substantial capital inflows into the wallets of prominent MKR holders, indicating robust buying activity in the crypto sphere.\n\nMakerDAO\u2019s Enhancements Attract Billions\n\nIn a comprehensive report released this week, Intotheblock has delved deep into the realm of DeFi, spotlighting one of its pioneering protocols, MakerDAO. The analysis revolves around the protocol\u2019s recent enhancements, propelling a staggering influx of nearly $1 billion in less than a week.\n\nThe surge is driven by DAI\u2019s growth and MKR token accumulation, potentially benefiting the wider crypto space. Regarding blockchains, Bitcoin fees rose 24.5%, reasons unclear, while Ethereum fees fell 21.2% due to lower volatility. Crypto-wise, Bitcoin, and Ether saw $50M outflows, signaling moderate trading.\n\nThe pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of MakerDAO\u2019s resurgence is its 8% stablecoin yield, rekindling the DeFi flame. Notably, the protocol\u2019s stablecoin, DAI, has gained the capability to earn the DAI Savings Rate (DSR), which recently surged to 8%.\n\nFueled by Maker\u2019s revenues, a substantial portion stemming from US treasuries collateral, this lucrative yield has far-reaching implications for the protocol and potentially beyond.\n\nFurthermore, the rise of real-world assets, such as treasuries, within DeFi is spotlighted. A substantial upswing in DAI capitalizing on the DSR, nearly $1 billion in a single week, coincided with a corresponding rise in DAI supply at a three-month zenith.\n\nThe upward trend of real-world asset integration in DeFi is further exemplified by protocols like Ondo Finance, securing $164 million in tokenized treasury deposits.\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t neglect DAI\u2019s resurgence as well. With volumes reaching heights unseen since the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, the potential to earn yield atop this blue-chip stablecoin is now generating ripples of positivity across DeFi.\n\nLastly, Maker\u2019s governance token, MKR, has exhibited remarkable growth, doubling in value over a mere three months. The significant inflow of MKR into the wallets of major holders underscores a robust appetite for the token, coinciding with a 35% price surge in the past month alone.\n\nThe report highlights a pivotal moment last July, linking the spike in large holders\u2019 netflows with Maker\u2019s founder, Rune, who acquired a hefty $24 million worth of MKR tokens over a year.\n\nRelated Reading | Coinbase Gets Support From Crypto-Friendly Senator In SEC Lawsuit"
