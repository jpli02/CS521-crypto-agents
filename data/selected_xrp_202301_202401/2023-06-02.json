        "title": "Ripple CTO Explains How to Profit from XRPL AMM Trading, Citing BTC/XRP Pair - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "The CTO of Ripple demystifies the trading strategy the upcoming XRP Ledger (XRPL) automated market maker (AMM) can leverage for profit.\n\nRipple\u2019s CTO, David Schwartz, has simplified the concept of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and their profitable trading strategies. AMMs utilize price volatility to generate financial gains, and Schwartz\u2019s explanation helps demystify the underlying principles.\n\nThe recent remarks further underscore David Schwartz\u2019s enthusiasm for the eventual launch of the XRP Ledger\u2019s native AMM. As The Crypto Basic reported two months back, Schwartz previously emphasized that the AMM is the most exciting feature to grace the XRPL in the past decade.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Ripple CTO recently took to Twitter to demystify how AMMs, such as the one coming to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), leverage price volatility.\n\nFor those who want to understand an AMM's trading strategy and may find the math too complex to follow, here's a grossly oversimplified way to understand how the trading strategy works: Say you have an asset that's volatile but no signifcant long-term trend. That is, its price\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 1, 2023\n\nSchwartz highlighted that AMMs excel when an asset observes marked volatility but retains its overall trend. The strategy involves buying when the price is low and selling when it is high, capitalizing on the average positive movement despite temporary fluctuations.\n\nThe concept involved is that even though the price may go up and down, the average movement is often positive, as the asset\u2019s overall trend remains intact. This means that, on average, profit is made by buying low and selling high.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, Schwartz emphasized that the strategy works best when one asset in the trading pair has a fixed price while the other asset observes volatile price swings. Reacting to this, XRP community member Molly Elmore asked if XRP could serve as the asset with a fixed price.\n\nThe XRPL AMM is Not Limited to Specific Asset Pairs\n\nIn response, Schwartz clarified that AMMs are not limited to specific asset pairs. They can be created between any two assets, although the mathematical properties of the trading strategy differ when both tokens exhibit volatility. Nonetheless, AMMs remain generally successful in such cases.\n\nNo. You can create AMM instances between any two assets. The trading strategy has somewhat different mathematical properties if both assets are volatile (like, say, a BTC/XRP AMM). But it's still interesting and generally quite good. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 2, 2023\n\nTo illustrate the concept further, Schwartz presented a hypothetical scenario. Instead of opting for an XRP/USD AMM, where USD remains stable, an investor bullish on both XRP and Bitcoin (BTC) can choose an XRP/BTC AMM. This approach allows them to benefit from the upward price movements of both assets.\n\nIn the example provided, if XRP and BTC double in price, an XRP/USD AMM yields a worst-case scenario of around 40%. In contrast, an XRP/BTC AMM could yield a worst-case scenario of 100%. However, it is essential to balance the AMM correctly and rebalance it when necessary for optimal results.\n\nSchwartz stressed that considering risks is crucial. If the investor\u2019s bullish forecast is incorrect, resulting in a 50% decrease in XRP and BTC prices, the worst-case loss for an XRP/USD AMM would be approximately 30%. In contrast, an XRP/BTC AMM would entail a 50% loss. Thus, XRP/USD is considered safer, while XRP/BTC exhibits higher volatility."

They\u2019re also calling for strict limits on any content produced by artificial intelligence.\n\nKeyser said AMPTP has yet to come to the table on key issues to compensate writers fairly, even as Hollywood studios rack up profits.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t negotiate for this now, when we come back in three years, it may be too late,\u201d Keyser said. \u201cYes, there are costs to it. There are terrible costs. We are painfully aware of those costs. The companies should come back and talk to us.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, the AMPTP said: \u201cMember companies remain united in their desire to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial to writers and the health and longevity of the industry, and to avoid hardship to the thousands of employees who depend upon the industry for their livelihoods.\u201d\n\nStalled negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild, which has already authorized a strike, and the Directors Guild of America, which has yet to reach its own deal with the AMPTP, may complicate the timeline for any resolution.\n\nDanny Tolli, a veteran writer and strike captain, said he\u2019s hanging on to two additional jobs unrelated to the studios in preparation for the long haul.\n\n\u201cI'm facing some financial hardships, but it's important to be out here,\u201d he said from outside the Netflix building on Sunset Boulevard. \u201cGiven where I was before the strike, it wasn't a dangerous gamble to go on strike. I was already seeing my career as a writer evaporate. I knew that this was important.\u201d\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
