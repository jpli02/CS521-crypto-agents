        "title": "This Is Why XRP Cannot Be Backed by Gold, Ex-Ripple Official Explains - U.Today",
        "content": "Ripple's former director of developer relations, Matt Hamilton, has dispelled another popular misconception surrounding XRP. This time it was talk and speculation that XRP could be backed by gold. This kind of talk has emerged relatively recently amid speculation that XRP could be accepted by the world's banks and other financial institutions for international settlements and would be backed by gold for its fair value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo gold for XRP\n\nHamilton is adamant that such an outcome is impossible. The blockchain developer explains his view that XRP is a decentralized cryptocurrency with finite supply, which trades on the open market and has no issuer to hold collateral for gold. For this reason, Hamilton explains, XRP cannot be inflated to have a peg with another asset.\n\nThe only contact between gold and XRP is possible through its tokenization via XRP Ledger, with the creation of a token tracking the precious metal's quotes, concluded the developer. For those who do not believe it and still think otherwise, Hamilton offered to exchange one ounce of gold for one XRP.\n\nYou can track gold by tokenising it on the XRP Ledger and creating a token such as XAU like companies have been doing for the past decade. But you can't back XRP itself with gold. \u2014 Matt Hamilton (@HammerToe) February 26, 2023\n\nPreviously, the former Ripple director, now a contributor to the Filecoin (FIL) ecosystem, also debunked rumors of a government buyout of the XRP offering. This theory was also extremely popular among the community and suggested that XRP would be bought back by the U.S. government at prices rumored to be as high as $10,000 per token."

        "title": "How AI can create ripples in the sports industry: IPL experts, technology-makers weigh in - Moneycontrol",
        "content": "Representational image. (Photo: Yogendra Singh via Unsplash)\n\nArtificial Intelligence is the new buzz in the global market, and the sports industry has started using the tool. Driven by data collection and science, it can help scout players, and predict their performance by gauging trigger points. Indian sports stakeholders understand the importance of statistics, but now they are even considering the physiological and psychological reading of athletes for supreme performance in every discipline.\n\nFinding talent through AI\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nFormer Tamil Nadu cricketer Malolan Rangarajan, now the head of scouting at IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore, used AI to unearth talent from the grassroots.\n\nHe discovered fast bowler Avinash Singh (Jammu & Kashmir) and leg-spinner Himanshu Sharma (Rajasthan) in RCB's Hinterland Scouting exercise with their AI partner. \"Human eye is still the most dependable, but when competing with nine other teams, you innovate new ways to identify talent. You have to trust AI in the algorithms we build.\n\n\"We are a country of more than a billion people. It is impossible to find talent through the human eye by having scouts everywhere. Every IPL franchise now has its scouting team. It is no more like finding that one player because 95 per cent of the players are playing either domestic or U-19 or some tournament,\" Rangarajan tells Moneycontrol.\n\nHinterland scouting\n\nWhile scouting, Rangarajan discovered talented players who could not play competitive cricket due to various pressures of life. \"Why don't we create an opportunity for them?\" he thought and entered AI as a trial to identify bowlers based on action.\n\nRangarajan is still researching what sort of action can result in what type of bowling. \"A particular type of action can help in bowling the yorkers and also swing the ball. It can help find out speeds, and the potential is infinite.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n\"We will start future predictability and batting. I feel it will change the landscape of scouting talent. All you need is videos of players,\" he adds.\n\nUse of AI in women's cricket\n\nRangarajan, also in charge of the franchise's Women's Premier League (WPL) wing, has asked for videos of bowlers to find one with a speed of 130 kmph. \"The number that has never happened in women's sport, but what if we find one who can bowl 130? We want to push boundaries. More than making RCB win, there is a larger picture being a scout; that you are providing an opportunity,\" says Rangarajan, who is hopeful of finding champions in RCB women's pool in the long run.\n\nAI, not everyone's go-to tool\n\nDespite the omnipresence of AI there are experts who believe more in the human eye while scouting players.\n\nAR Srikkanth, head of scouting at Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), still goes by the age-old cricketing acumen to select players. \"The last time in eight years, KKR has given many players who have gone on to represent India in various formats. If something is working for you, there is no need to reinvent and look for something new in the market just for the sake of it.\n\n\"Technology can enhance decision-making capability but it will not make the decision for you. I feel humans still have to make decisions, and technology will only support the decision-making capabilities,\" says Srikkanth, who was instrumental in identifying the talent of Suryakumar Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav and Sunil Narine to name a few.\n\nPhysiological mapping, the future\n\nRenowned strength and conditioning coach Ramji Srinivasan believes AI is one of the best mediums to create longevity for an athlete.\n\nHe batted for data collection of an athlete on the individual level, from start to sleep, for smooth performance. \"From training methodology, biomechanics, predicting injuries, recovery protocol to understanding the psychological aspects. It helps with pre-game strategies, in-game activities and tactical skills,\" says Srinivasan, who trained the Indian cricket team in the victorious World Cup in 2011.\n\n\"If there is a muscle imbalance from one side to the other, the probability of related injuries could be more. With AI, you can predict the load on the injured muscle,\" he adds.\n\nThe motion data of the players and the statistics of the matches are involved in the interpretations. The data points can be crunched to help the athlete read his performance better. \"AI is always about learning and personalising with the athlete. Any data from the performance side of a player is crucial to set a baseline and then use analytic skills to understand the areas for improvement,\" says Teja Prakash Kakarla, the co-founder of Netrin Sports Technologies, which enhances the performance of athletes by enabling the coaches and trainers with technology components.\n\n\"We try to understand wellness as well as physical performance. We try to customise the training based on the baseline,\" he adds.\n\nMental imagery of the athlete\n\nKarthik Raghavendran, the co-founder of Neurostellar, is working on a mental fitness platform by building a wearable device. \"It can clock the athlete's brain activities, heart and respiratory rates, and over a while, it provides insights on their relaxation, stress and focus levels from all these metrics. It gives neurofeedback training, too. It can make them aware of what is happening in their body. It will help them to train their brain better,\" he says.\n\nThe wearable band will aim to make a difference in alternative sports such as table tennis, golf, archery and shooting. \"It's in the range of Rs 25,000-30,000 and a one-time cost for the headband. We charge on a subscription basis for personalised reports, wellness coaches and other premium features,\" adds Raghavendran, confirming that table tennis legend Sharath Kamal recently had a session with the gear.\n\nWith the help of Machine Learning, AI can personalise diet plans with athletes based on their situations; before or after a match day. And it is, perhaps, here to stay to make a sports person's life easier to some extent."

        "title": "The pebble versus the rock: a case for mental health reform - Kevin MD",
        "content": "What would you expect to see if you threw a pebble in a pond? You would likely see a ripple in the water, extending wider than the diameter of the pebble. Seeing a pebble drop into a pond and create ripples is always mesmerizing. It\u2019s amazing to observe the concentric circles slowly expanding outwards from the point of impact. It\u2019s a fascinating example of how energy can travel through water, allowing us to watch something so small cause an effect so large. The ripple caused by your pebble will eventually spread beyond its initial size to create an area much larger than the stone you threw in. The intricate pattern created on the surface is a reminder of how even a tiny action can have far-reaching effects.\n\nThrowing a larger rock into the water would lead to an entirely different impression than with a pebble. With a sturdy rock, you could expect to see larger waves ripple outward and a bigger splash that carries far more energy. The size and strength of the waves created will depend on how large the rock is and how quickly it was thrown. Imagine that the rock creates a temporary disturbance in an otherwise tranquil lake, like a momentary balance disruption. The change can be quite drastic; where before you saw small ripples only a few feet away from each side of the impact zone, now you might see much larger ones reaching far beyond that point. Such an imposing presence would influence its environment for some time before fading away into nothing.\n\nHealth care providers have an incredibly important job of caring for patients, but the difficulty and effectiveness of treatments vary greatly depending on several factors. Comparing health challenges to pebbles or rocks can help provide perspective for understanding issues like the speed at which health issues develop and the scope of impact. Compared to a rock, a pebble may take less time to move and affect a smaller area, while the rock can quickly take over an entire landscape due to its mass. Understanding this element of health challenges is essential to understand best how they will ultimately impact a patient\u2019s life and that of their family, friends, colleagues, and community. As such, every health provider must keep this in mind when developing care plans with each patient.\n\nI have been a primary care physician for over a decade and have been blessed to care for upwards of four generations of one family. More recently, I have pivoted my career and focused more on a holistic, system approach to care by adding coaching to the services I provide. I have witnessed firsthand the impact of the pebble versus the rock in my patient\u2019s life. Unless one looks deeper and goes beyond the surface, you will likely be unable to understand the scope of the impact.\n\nFor years, I have spoken publicly about the need for us to take mental health and its effects seriously. We cannot overlook its critical importance as it is the foundation of physical and community health. Ignoring the mental aspect puts us in danger of succumbing to psychological and physical damage. We must pursue understanding and seek solutions for mental health issues, or we will be doomed to suffer from their consequences regardless of our desire for betterment. Understanding, accepting, and acting upon our needs is a necessary and worthwhile task, but it will not be sufficient if we do not extend this same obligation to others. Mental health is not something we can easily ignore or brush aside; conquering it requires concerted effort and commitment from everyone so that finally, after all these years, we can make a real dent in this crisis.\n\nWith the increase in mental health challenges over the past few years, it is more important than ever to understand how this affects society. While it is easy to think of mental health issues affecting those on the margins of our world, the reality is that these struggles could happen to anyone\u2014and often do. External appearances cannot recognize many individuals with mental health concerns. They can look like anyone attending school, shopping at the grocery store, or leading a community organization or business enterprise. This challenge speaks to false images and perceptions of this health issue which must be addressed for progress. Unlearning narrow conceptions and creating dialogue around modern-day realities concerning mental health issues and their effects is essential for furthering social understanding of this crucial matter.\n\nMental health crises are a global issue that cannot be addressed with individual solutions. We need to take a systemic approach to combat this epidemic, changing not only the environment of those suffering from mental health issues but also attempting to alter the systems and societies that cause such profound distress in communities worldwide. Doing so requires us to look at the problem holistically, examining any policies or cultural attitudes that may contribute to mental anguish and shifting our perspective away from individuals and towards viewing mental health within its collective context. By focusing on managing mental health at a societal level, we can improve emotional well-being at all stages of life \u2014 for ourselves and others.\n\nFor system-wide reform to become a reality, we must have governmental leaders who recognize and understand mental health issues. Without this knowledge, legislation to help and protect those potentially affected by mental illness may do more harm than good. This leader must be aware of their perspectives, beliefs, and mindsets when deliberating on policy changes. This will ensure policies constantly evolve to reflect the needs of those in need. By taking a holistic view of how social systems are interrelated, we can understand why specific public issues arise in the first place and gain crucial insights into possible solutions. Therefore, having informed and understanding leaders in government about mental health is undeniably essential for progress toward successful reform legislative reform that reflects the needs of all parties involved.\n\nLeaders and those at the front lines of patient interaction face a daunting challenge when understanding the full scope of mental health issues. So much needs to be done to understand the true impact of these conditions truly. Once an understanding is gained, action must be taken to make meaningful impacts. It\u2019s not enough for leaders and front-line workers to recognize mental health as a priority; it requires deep commitment, dedication, and consistent effort to keep pushing forward even when progress appears slow or nonexistent. We have all seen how much progress can be made when society mobilizes around a single cause \u2014 we must all now strive with the same determination towards establishing successful efforts that treat mental health holistically and with care.\n\nSo, in conclusion, let us spin the pebble versus the rock analogy the other way around. Will our solutions have the impact of the pebble, or will we start making waves and have the impact of the rock? Quite frankly, I pick the latter, and it\u2019s time that we collectively begin making waves.\n\nTomi Mitchell, a family physician and founder of Dr. Tomi Mitchell Holistic Wellness Strategies, is not only a distinguished international keynote speaker but also a passionate advocate for mental health and physician\u2019s well-being, hosting her podcast, The Mental Health & Wellness Show.
