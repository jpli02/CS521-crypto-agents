        "content": "Keen photographer Roger Mason snapped the grass snake after noticing movement by the edge of a lake at a county nature reserve in Ripple, near Upton-upon-Severn in Worcestershire.\n\nMr Mason was originally looking to grab pictures of dragonflies at the lakes before he spotted the snake.\n\nHe said: \"I was down at the Ripple Lakes yesterday which is now a bit of a nature reserve after the old quarrying workings there.\n\n\"There are two large lakes there now each side of the M50 motorway. As I was wandering about I noticed movement in the water just by the edge of the lake.\n\n\"Fortunately I already had my camera ready and was able to get a few shots of the grass snake before it swam off into the reeds.\"\n\nGrass snakes are harmless to humans and can often be found in wetland habitats.\n\nThey can live between 15-25 years and can commonly be observed between April and October in the county.\n\nThe species is protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981."

        "content": "In a relatively surprising series of events, a substantial purchase of XRP tokens totaling $1.5 million was executed, sending ripples (no pun intended) through the cryptocurrency community.\n\nThis acquisition led to the creation of two notable green candles on the XRP chart \u2013 an event that has sparked conversations about a potentially more impressive price surge soon.\n\nThe Aug. 25 transaction did not go unnoticed; market tracking instruments immediately detected it, causing a stir among traders and analysts speculating about its potential impact.\n\nIn the crypto market, sudden and significant purchases often happen before notable price fluctuations occur.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 JUST IN: A whopping 1.5 million $ worth of #XRP was scooped up in an instant 10 minutes ago! Those twin green candles with massive wicks are signaling something BIG. \ud83d\udcc8 Brace yourselves, XRP fam \u2013 looks like a major pump is on the horizon! \ud83c\udf0a Who else is seeing this? Drop\u2026 pic.twitter.com/o2gy965qqF \u2014 WallStreetBulls (@w_thejazz) August 25, 2023\n\nAdding to the intrigue is the timing of this transaction. Such significant movements suggest a broader market strategy at play with the current volatility.\n\nThe identity and the motive behind this $1.5 million purchase remain undisclosed for the time being.\n\nRecall that Ripple\u2019s native token exploded a few months ago when the blockchain company won a partial victory against the SEC in their ongoing legal case that started in late 2020.\n\nXRP almost doubled its value in the following few days and tapped a multi-year of over $0.9. While the community was preparing to challenge the coveted $1 price tag, though, the cryptocurrency reversed its trajectory and started losing value.\n\nEarlier this month, XRP plummeted hard to $0.5, alongside the rest of the market. As such, the asset erased all of its post-SEC-victory gains, but purchases like the aforementioned one could change the tides once again."

        "title": "Six Takeaways From The Edinburgh TV Festival: Strike Ripples, Commissioning Slowdowns & AI - Deadline",
        "content": "The 2023 edition of the Edinburgh TV Festival is drawing to a close after four days of intense industry talks, gossip and Louis Theroux lectures. The halls of the Edinburgh International Conference Centre were buzzing as UK execs, creatives and talent took the chance to get together and talk shop. Here we outline six key themes that emerged.\n\n\u201cRipple effect\u201d of the strikes\n\nNo TV industry confab would be complete at present without a bit of strike chatter. As the writers strike moves way beyond 100 days and the actors\u2019 action rumbles on, the \u201cripple effects\u201d continue to be felt around the world, according to Lindsay Salt, the BBC\u2019s new Drama Director. There was a small American presence at Edinburgh plus numerous UK commmissioners from the U.S. streamers\u2019 hubs but, somewhat surprisingly, the labor action was not raised during panel sessions with both Netflix and Disney execs. Universal\u2019s Pearlena Igbokwe, however, did tackle the elephant in the room, stating that CEOs and top senior leaders are \u201cinvested and committed to figuring out a deal that is fair and equitable for everybody.\u201d In the busy halls of the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, attendees that Deadline spoke with off record had mixed feelings about the strikes, which are biting at the same time as an unrelated commissioning slowdown driven by the economic crisis (more on that later). While there was a general feeling of solidarity coupled with knowledge that a good deal for the U.S. is a good deal for the UK, there were frustrations over loss of work caused by a labor action happening thousands of miles away. Equity boss Paul Fleming threw his weight behind SAG-AFTRA\u2019s plight during a webinar to hundreds of union workers on Monday but the feeling of loss of work was compounded by a petition launched this week calling for the UK government to create an \u201cincome replacement scheme\u201d for those who have lost work, which has amassed 25,000 signatures. Yesterday afternoon, The Late, Late Show with James Corden executive producer Ben Winston said his company, Fulwell73, had lost a premium unscripted order in the U.S. due to budget concerns related to the strikes. The longer the twin disputes rumble on, the more the freelance community may feel its patience beginning to wear thin.\n\nHow fast is the slowdown?\n\nIt\u2019s been a slow old summer in the world of UK TV commissioning. Ever since Deadline revealed Channel 4 had canceled a high-profile Four Weddings reboot due to budget constraints, freelancers and execs alike have been feeling the heavy weight of the commissioning slowdown, driven in the main by the ad slump. Channel 4 has been in the eye of the slowdown storm and programs boss Ian Katz was forced onto the defensive during his spotlight session by a volley of tricky questions about the network\u2019s finances. He fought fire with fire when claiming Channel 4 has \u201cperhaps been a bit more honest\u201d than rivals about the slowdown, as he pushed back on the perception that C4\u2019s financial picture is \u201cmore dramatic than elsewhere.\u201d The previous day, Katz\u2019s ITV counterpart Kevin Lygo said he would not be dropping ITV\u2019s program budget during the slowdown. \u201cI hear Channel 4 shut the gates or something but we are not doing that,\u201d Lygo added, refusing to mince his words as ever. The BBC, for what it\u2019s worth, may not be funded by ads but is certainly not immune from the slowdown\u2019s clutches following two years of a frozen licence fee. Content boss Charlotte Moore backed the pubcaster\u2019s long-established \u2018fewer bigger better\u2019 approach, which she said is a \u201cgood thing in today\u2019s market.\u201d\n\nFreelancer woes\n\nSwathes of the UK\u2019s freelance community attended Edinburgh as per but the collective atmosphere was muted. The aforementioned commissioning slowdown has meant a seriously tough few months, with the Film & TV Charity revealing the shocking statistic Monday that applications for financial help rose 800% in July 2023 compared to the same time last year. Execs debated the situation and presented more research \u2013 such as this gobsmacking BAFTA survey finding that a third of its members are quitting the TV industry \u2013 but few genuine solutions were forthcoming. The situation represents a complete 360 from the previous year, when it felt as if the freelance workforce was virtually at full employment. During the opening Power of TV debate, chaired by Deadline\u2019s Jake Kanter, incoming Film & TV Charity CEO Marcus Ryder urged a change in industry structures akin to the changes which caused a flood of investment in Scottish TV around 15 years ago \u2013 establishing what would become a thriving production sector. Storyville boss Emma Hindley floated a number of \u201cwacky ideas\u201d such as bosses paying 1% of their bonuses to the charity\u2019s donation fund, or celebraties giving a day\u2019s earnings, but the situation is far from resolved and will require a huge collective effort until commissioning returns to something akin to normal once again.\n\nPresenters, behave\n\nThe behavior of presenters when the cameras are turned off has been placed firmly in the spotlight this year due to high-profile scandals invloving Phillip Schofield and Huw Edwards, along with Deadline\u2019s investigation into TV chef James Martin. Avalon boss Jon Thoday returned the Schofield drama to the fore during the opening debate when he exclaimed \u201csurprise\u201d that ITV bosses didn\u2019t know about the former This Morning host\u2019s affair with a much younger runner. \u201cIf you run a business and someone is doing something wrong it\u2019s unusual for [management] not to know about it,\u201d mused Thoday, coming a few weeks after ITV CEO Carolyn McCall said \u201cno evidence\u201d was ever presented to her team about the affair. ITV\u2019s Lygo updated on the independent Schofield review during his controller session, which he said is on track to publish next month, with the lawyer leading the review having \u201ctalked to everyone involved, taken our phones and looked at every text we\u2019ve sent, including emails and WhatsApps.\u201d Lygo urged people not to rush to \u201chasty judgement\u201d before publication, citing \u201cenormous pressure from press and social media\u201d attached to the saga. The BBC\u2019s joint reviews sparked by the Edwards scandal are also both due in the coming weeks and it is unlikely this topic will be exiting the headlines anytime soon.\n\nAll eyes on AI\n\nOn Wednesday, producers crammed into a fun (and alarming) session on how AI will impact TV making in the future. TV producer-turned-academic Alex Connock, maths professor and broadcaster Hannah Fry and BBC Commissioning Editor Muslim Alim took to the stage to reveal the dos and don\u2019ts of using AI in the future. Connock, a Fellow at the Said Business School and co-founder of Bob Geldof\u2019s Ten Alps TV, warned those working in development that while AI could help speed up their processes and fuel creativity, many copyright infringement cases are already stemming from the use of generative machines, which are usually created and programmed by scraping existing work from the internet and regurgitating it. In an email he sent Deadline after the session, Connock predicted it would become standard practice for actors to monetize their likeness in the future and, provided it\u2019s regulated properly, won\u2019t be the disaster situation that many believe is developing. With AI one of the bitterest elements of the actors strike, the idea the future isn\u2019t so dark is a soothing one. However, Connock said actors were right to be worried about their voices being used without explicit permission, and in datasets. \u201cIf I were acting for the actors, voice synthesis would be a hill I would be prepared to die on, in negotiation point terms.\u201d TV companies are certainly taking AI seriously: just this week Banijay launched the AI Creative Fund, which will allow producers and labels across the super-indies production footprint to showcase ideas with technology and innovation at their heart.\n\nCan I take your orders?\n\nEdinburgh is traditionally the week when the UK\u2019s networks and streamers reveal their latest slate. With commissioning becoming less structured and formulaic, the number of announcements has fallen in recent years but there was plenty to digest in any case. Netflix got in first, unveiling doc series Einstein and the Bomb. Clearly influenced by Oppenheimer\u2018s success, the John Boyega-narrated series will look at the devastating after effects of the atomic bomb the U.S. dropped on Japan in World War II. Disney+\u2019s UK team have been focused on local stories such as their upcoming Coleen Rooney \u2018Agatha Christie\u2019 doc series, but the greenlight of World War Shoe: Adidas vs. Puma (w/t), a doc series from Pretty Boat Rocker\u2019s Baby: Brooke Shields producer Matador Content, and David Beckham\u2019s Studio 99, was more overtly a global streamer order. The series will explore the inner workings of the two major sports brands, which have a unique shared history and rivalry having been created by feuding brothers Adi and Rudi Dassler. ITV revealed its reboot of Big Brother will run for at least two seasons and Sky revealed House of Kardashian, a doc series about the famous reality TV family directed by Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story director Katie Hindley. Prime Video had little in the way of new commissions but its exec did address the future of Clarkson\u2019s Farm after its star, Jeremy Clarkson, wrote an article about Meghan Markle that was so vicious and aggressive that it has become the most-complained about column in UK press history. Elsewhere, the BBC ordered another drama from Happy Valley scribe Sally Wainwright, titled Hot Flush. Channel 4 made several program announcements, including a further season of Everyone Else Burns, a Rosie Jones comedy series titled Disability Benefits and doc The Murder Retrial (w/t)."
