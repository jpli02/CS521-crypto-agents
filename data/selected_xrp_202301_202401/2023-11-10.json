        "content": "T Introduces: A Fashion Designer Carries on the Legacy of a Textile Artist\n\nThe fashion designer Marco Zanini\u2019s mother is Swedish, but growing up in his father\u2019s native Italy, he never gave his Nordic roots much thought. It wasn\u2019t until he turned 30 that he \u201cbecame passionate about anything Scandinavian,\u201d says the Milan-based 52-year-old, who served as the creative director of Halston, Rochas and Schiaparelli before launching his namesake ready-to-wear brand in 2019. \u201cI started to spend my summers there, digging into anything that felt and looked Swedish.\u201d\n\nOne of his discoveries was the work of M\u00e4rta M\u00e5\u00e5s-Fjetterstr\u00f6m (1873-1941), a textile artist known for her elaborate patterns that meld Swedish folk motifs with Modernist design. After purchasing two of her rugs at auction, he became fascinated with the idea of visiting her studio (\u201cI wanted to see those famous looms,\u201d he says), which is still in operation in the small southern Swedish town of B\u00e5stad, and in 2016 he contacted the company that had been established to continue M\u00e5\u00e5s-Fjetterstr\u00f6m\u2019s work shortly after she died. When Tina Swedrup, its current co-owner, received his message, \u201cI of course Googled him,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I realized I really loved his designs.\u201d\n\nWhen the two eventually met in person, they connected over their commitment to slow, careful production and their shared interest in traditional crafts. Last December, Swedrup broached the idea of collaborating on a rug. Not long after, Zanini was sitting on the atelier\u2019s worn wooden floor sifting through thousands of hand-dyed wool skeins to come up with 12 different color schemes for his design called A Righe (which is Italian for \u201cstriped\u201d).\n\n\u201cMy motto was \u2018keep it simple,\u2019\u201d says Zanini, who counts traditional Swedish rag rugs and the distinctively glazed mid-20th-century pottery by Berndt Friberg among his inspirations. Still, the magic of a M\u00e5\u00e5s-Fjetterstr\u00f6m creation lies in its inherent complexity. Each stripe of the rug is made up of 25 different yarns in complementary tones, the order of which is chosen by the weaver. When seen together, however, they read as a single block of color. In preparation for the process, Zanini had to handpick threads in 1,800 different hues. The resulting m\u00e9lange creates the illusion that the stripes are rippling like the surface of a stream. \u201cI thought, \u2018It will never match the beauty [M\u00e5\u00e5s-Fjetterstr\u00f6m] created in her lifetime,\u2019\u201d says Zanini, whose rugs are available made to order from the company\u2019s permanent collection. \u201cBut you can go near it, at least.\u201d \u2014 Laura May Todd"

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nRipple Expands: Partners with Onafriq to establish payment corridors in 27 African countries, using blockchain for efficient remittances and payments.\n\nXRP Approved in MEASA: Gains approval from Dubai Financial Services Authority, potentially extending its reach to 72 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.\n\nRipple Against SEC: Despite U.S. regulatory hurdles, Ripple\u2019s growth continues; CEO Brad Garlinghouse is prepared to escalate legal battles if necessary.\n\nRipple Establishing Payment Corridors Across 27 African Countries\n\nDespite the ongoing battle against the SEC, Ripple continues expanding outside the U.S. by upgrading its Ripple Payments service to dozens of European countries, including the Middle East and Africa.\n\nMost recently, Ripple partnered with mobile payments provider Onafriq. As part of the partnership, Onafriq will use Ripple Payments\u2019 blockchain to power new corridors between 27 African countries, the U.K., Australia, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).\n\nRipple, alongside three other partnering companies, will allow citizens from across these countries to conduct low-cost, high-speed remittance and business payments across Onafriq\u2019s pan-African network.\n\nXRP Could be Used in 72 MEASA Countries\n\nAs CryptoPotato reported, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) approved XRP for use within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) \u2014the leading financial hub in the Middle East. This means licensed crypto firms and businesses within the DIFC can integrate XRP into their digital asset services.\n\nCEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the company intends to double down in the region as its regulatory environment fosters crypto innovation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to see the DFSA encourage the adoption and use of digital assets such as XRP to position Dubai as a leading financial services hub intent on attracting foreign investment and accelerating economic growth.\u201d\n\nHowever, this might be more important than what it appears; the DIFC, as we stated, is a leading financial hub, not just in the Middle East but the entire MEASA region \u2014the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.\n\nIn other words, XRP may now be available as a payment service in up to 72 countries within the MEASA region, including financial hubs like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Israel, Qatar, and India. These and other countries within the region have a combined nominal GDP of over $8 trillion.\n\nRipple Remains Fearless\n\nRipple is expanding to other countries as the current regulatory environment in the U.S. makes it harder for the company to operate, according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Other countries provide more precise frameworks for cryptocurrency companies, and the U.S. is rather hostile toward crypto entrepreneurs and businesses.\n\nDuring an interview at D.C. Fintech Week 2023, the executive recently said that Ripple is ready to take the case to the Supreme Court if the SEC appeals the case should the company win the trial in April 2024."
