        "title": "XRP Lawsuit: Ripple Fires Back At SEC For Seeking Financial Statements And Discovery - CoinGape",
        "content": "In the latest development in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple Labs, defendant Ripple opposed the SEC seeking audited financial statements, post-complaint contracts for the sale or transfer of XRP to\n\n\u201cnon-employee counterparties\u201d, and details on the amount of \u201cXRP Institutional Sales proceeds\u201d received after the lawsuit filing.\n\nRipple Opposes SEC\u2019s Requests\n\nAccording to a court filing late January 19, Ripple opposed the U.S. SEC\u2019s motion to compel certain post-complaint discovery. Ripple lawyers have been tackling the SEC\u2019s move in the XRP lawsuit, urging Judge Analisa Torres to rule in their favor due to irrational arguments by the SEC.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe SEC requested the court to compel Ripple to submit audited financial statements for 2022-2023, contracts for the sale or transfer of XRP to \u201cnon-employee counterparties\u201d, and amount of \u201cXRP Institutional Sales proceeds\u201d received after the filing.\n\nHowever, Ripple gave two reasons to deny the request. Firstly, the SEC has failed to request discovery while fact discovery was open and now lacks good cause for further discovery concerning post-complaint sales.\n\n\u201cThe SEC never argued that post-complaint discovery was relevant to remedies but instead took the position that post-complaint conduct was entirely irrelevant to the case. That motion was resolved after Ripple agreed,\u201d argues Ripple.\n\nSecondly, the SEC requests are irrelevant and has no bearing on the court\u2019s remedies determination. The SEC\u2019s considering whether Ripple\u2019s post-complaint conduct violated the law will need a lengthy fact discovery period or a new litigation.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s interrogatory in particular, the SEC has used all of its interrogatories in the case and cannot unilaterally grant itself more.\u201d Ripple urges the court to deny irrelevant post-complaint discovery.\n\nCoinGape earlier reported that the SEC\u2019s motion to compel is grounded in a July 2023 ruling, where it was determined that XRP tokens qualify as a security when sold to institutional investors.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Sees Mild Bounce back, Whale Activity at 15-Month High\n\nLawyers Claim the Discovery As Irrelevant In XRP Lawsuit\n\nAttorney Jeremy Hogan said the SEC now seeking relatively minor discovery dispute is not all that legally interesting. He also looks at the SEC\u2018s grand press release from 2020 when it filed the lawsuit and it shows the SEC is losing its grip on the lawsuit.\n\nAttorney Bill Morgan pointed out that the SEC would require litigating whether post-complaint sales meet the Howey test. He claims ODL customers will raise an issue as he referred to in his several earlier posts. \u201cHow does an ODL customers expect profits from using XRP.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: US SEC Acknowledged Options for Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Approval By Feb End?"

        "title": "Ripple responds to SEC filing, argues the regulator is asking for irrelevant information - FXStreet",
        "content": "Information, if any, won\u2019t affect potential penalties or injunctions for Ripple. The firm has challenged the SEC\u2019s need for additional information to assess penalties. The argument is that new information is not needed for old actions and an injunction based on new information will not address the regulator\u2019s initial allegations against the payment giant.\n\nThe regulator wants to explore the firm\u2019s finances and XRP sales by Ripple but the payment remittance giant objected. The fact discovery process closed months ago, according to Ripple\u2019s lawyers the regulator had ample opportunity for the same.\n\nRipple\u2019s lawyers filed a response to the US financial regulator\u2019s motion to compel. The payment remittance firm argued that the SEC is asking for irrelevant information to subvert the legal process.\n\nRipple, the crossborder payment remittance firm, filed its response to the SEC\u2019s motion to compel, on January 19, 2024. In its response, the firm outlined its argument and lawyers noted that the US financial regulator is asking for irrelevant information.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn the latest development in its ongoing lawsuit, Ripple has objected to the SEC's request for post-complaint discovery.\n\n\n\nJames K. Filan, a former federal prosecutor who regularly posts updates on the Ripple SEC action, made it known in a new tweet that Ripple has filed its response opposing the SEC's motion to compel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the filing, the SEC seeks to compel Ripple to produce audited financial statements for the years 2022 and 2023; produce all post-complaint contracts for the sale or transfer of XRP to \"non-employee counterparties\"; and answer an interrogatory about the amount of \"XRP institutional sales proceeds\" received after the filing of the complaint for certain contracts.\n\nLet's unpack #Ripple's response to the SEC filing!\n\nRipple argues the SEC is asking for unnecessary information and trying to subvert the legal process. Let's outline the argument:\n\n1/5\n\n(As always, thanks to @FilanLaw, for the file!) https://t.co/CxUa527AFC \u2014 WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) January 20, 2024\n\nRipple opposes these requests, saying first that they are untimely. Ripple pointed out that the SEC had enough chance to seek most of the requested discovery while fact discovery was open but chose not to do so and now lacks good cause to do so.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the SEC\u2019s discovery requests seek information that is irrelevant to remedies, Ripple said.\n\nRipple stated that the parties had already litigated whether post-complaint discovery was appropriate and that during that discovery dispute, the SEC never argued that post-complaint discovery was relevant to remedies, instead claiming that post-complaint conduct was completely irrelevant to the case. The motion was resolved after Ripple agreed. As a result, the SEC should not be allowed to reverse its cause.\n\nRipple pointed out the SEC's \"unreasonable\" demands, stating that on Nov. 14, the SEC served nine interrogatories and three RFPs (requests for productions) on Ripple.\n\nIn December, Ripple objected to these requests on several grounds, including the fact that discovery was closed, except for the narrow discovery granted by the Court on Nov. 13. In addition to this, the SEC had exceeded the 25 interrogatories allowed under Rule 33, and certain of the requests related to post-complaint conduct were irrelevant.\n\nRipple also argues that adjudicating the legality of Ripple\u2019s post-complaint sales might embroil the Court and parties in lengthy ancillary litigation.\n\nRipple's stand-up to the SEC's requests has attracted comments and praise from the XRP community. Meanwhile, the XRP community keeps their fingers crossed, expecting positivity in the hopes that the Ripple SEC lawsuit will see an ultimate conclusion this year, 2024."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights President's silence on XRP adoption sparks community concern and questions about CEO's strategy.\n\nRecent dip below $0.57 fuels uncertainty about XRP's stability and future value.\n\nCommunity divided on how regulatory clarity and external projects will impact XRP's post-lawsuit trajectory.\n\nThe XRP community is at a crossroads, facing internal debates and external uncertainties. Discussions about the Chief Technology Officer\u2019s strategy and the President\u2019s silence on XRP adoption, coupled with a recent dip below $0.57, lead to a crucial question: can XRP withstand the pressure and stay above $0.56? This week\u2019s analysis aims to shed light on XRP\u2019s path in these uncertain times.\n\nCurrently, XRP is trading at $0.5667, showing a 0.73% decrease, with a market cap of $30.83 billion. The recent dip raises questions about the cryptocurrency\u2019s stability, with investors closely watching for any further drop below $0.56.\n\nRipple\u2019s Leadership Challenge\n\nThe absence of a clear stance from Ripple\u2019s President, Monica Long, about reducing XRP adoption has raised concerns. In a recent interview, Long\u2019s ambiguous responses have left many uneasy, prompting questions about Ripple\u2019s direction.\n\nIn the interview, Long was asked about the U.S. court\u2019s impact on XRP. However, her responses lacked a clear timeline or support for increased adoption. The community is puzzled by her focus on market trends and ETF speculation, leaving room for interpretation but lacking a strong affirmation.\n\nRead More: Ripple\u2019s CTO Chooses Ripple Shares Over XRP: An Inside Look\n\nCommunity Reactions\n\nKey community figures, like \u201cWrathofKahneman,\u201d noted the gap between the adoption question and Long\u2019s market-centric focus. The general feeling leans toward a subtle \u201cno,\u201d as Long\u2019s response doesn\u2019t confirm a positive direction for XRP adoption.\n\nThis is the #Ripple president, Long, speaking.\n\nAlso, the question is about adoption but the response seems to address price, not what I'd immediately think is adoption. Perhaps, too, a need to keep some distance in press given the suit? \u2014 WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) January 19, 2024\n\nOn the other hand, Yassin Mobarak, founder of Dizer Capital, expressed concerns about the fundamental nature of Long\u2019s response. He highlighted the lack of a definitive answer as a fundamental issue, proposing two possible conclusions: continued challenges for Ripple in the U.S. market, even with regulatory clarity, or the potential influence of projects on the XRP ledger in driving adoption and price growth.\n\nWhat\u2019s Beyond the Lawsuit?\n\nXRP community members are pondering what will drive adoption in the future. Questions arise about whether clear regulations alone are enough or if projects like Hooks, Evernode, and xSpectar on the XRP ledger will play a crucial role. Ripple\u2019s President, by not providing a clear answer, has added uncertainty about how regulations and the overall XRP ecosystem will shape its future.\n\nRead More: Analyst Predicts 50% Surge for XRP Price in 90 Days, but Here\u2019s the Catch\n\nStakeholders are closely watching to see how XRP adoption unfolds after the lawsuit, seeking clarity amidst ongoing speculation."

        "title": "6 Biggest Banks Using Ripple (XRP) Products - UseTheBitcoin",
        "content": "RippleNet is a network that processes cross-border payments in real-time and with little costs. Banks using Ripple XRP are getting more and more. Banks that join this platform are able to extend their payment offerings into new markets that are otherwise out of their reach.\n\nRipple already has gathered an impressive number of payment, exchange, and transfer providers, out of which more than 100 are banks. Its growth has been mirrored in the recent increase in the price of the platform\u2019s native token, XRP, which recently became the second-largest coin according to market cap.\n\nBig Banks Using Ripple\n\nBelow is a list of the biggest banks that have joined the network and are, or will be using Ripple XRP products.\n\nPNC Bank\n\nPNC Bank, one of the top ten banks in the United States with over $6.0 billion in deposits, joined XRP blockchain in 2016 to use its solution for cross-border payments and settlement.\n\nPNC Bank has more than eight million customers and has retail subdivisions in 19 states, which helps the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to enhance its position within the US banking sector. PNC started using xCurrent in September 2018, to improve the speed of its payment process.\n\nSource: www.pnc.com\n\nSantander Bank\n\nSantander Bank, N. A. is a subsidiary of Spanish Santander Group. Its focus market is the north-eastern United States. Having over $57.5 billion in deposits, it operates about 650 retail banking offices and over 2,000 ATMs.\n\nThe announcement of the strategic partnership between Ripple Labs and Santander was made in March of 2018 but, at the time, the details of the collaborative work between the two companies were not made public.\n\nSince then, the Ripple team officially stated that Santander has been testing RippleNet and other liquidity products available on its blockchain network.\n\nThe bank started using xCurrent in November 2017.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank\n\nStandard Chartered, the multinational company headquartered in London, England, that provides financial and banking services, partnered with Ripple blockchain network in 2016.\n\nThey started using xCurrent in 2016, but they further announced the expansion of the Ripple (XRP) Network. They plan on providing cross-border payments for an additional five pairs of countries by the 2018\u2019s end.\n\nIn November, however, the bank decided to expand even more their influence through Ripple (XRP), to tap into the $15 billion trade corridor between India and Singapore.\n\nCuallix\n\nCuallix is a financial institution that has operated for over 25 years in Mexico, United States and Hong Kong, and partnered with Ripple in October 2017. They provide credit and payment processing solutions to individual and enterprise use, with custom-adjusted products to fit their customer needs and digital content.\n\nIn last year\u2019s October, the Bank implemented xCurrent, Ripple\u2019s enterprise solution that facilitates the instantaneous settlement and end-to-end tracking of cross-border payments between RippleNet members.\n\nIn February 2018, Cuallix became one of the first financial institutions to use xRapid \u2013 Ripple\u2019s solution that uses XRP as a liquidity tool \u2013 to reduce the cost of sending cross-border payments from the US to Mexico.\n\nThis shows that Cuallix is a bank whose managers have open minds. Maybe in the near future, we will see other banks that will implement the XRapid service and the XRP currency in cross-border payments.\n\nSource: twitter.com\n\nSkandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB)\n\nSEB, a Stockholm-based financial group for corporate customers, financial institutions and private individuals, is one of Sweden\u2019s biggest banks. It currently has more than 16,000 employees and serves 400,000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), 3,000 corporate and institutional customers, and more than four million people.\n\nThey started using xCurrent in 2017 and Paula da Silva stated the following regarding its evolution of use: \u201clast year there was only one customer on it. Now we have ALL SEB customers doing inter-company transfers between Sweden and the US on the Ripple platform. So we have a couple of billion going through that\u201d.\n\nAccording to an official statement, the Bank\u2019s primary objective of using Ripple\u2019s products is to settle payments between Sweden and the United States.\n\nMitsubishi UFG\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. also entered a collaboration with Ripple. It\u2019s the fifth-largest bank in the world by total assets, having a larger capital base than that of other consortia such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (ranked 6th), Goldman Sachs (ranked 35th) or even Santander (ranked 16th).\n\nA Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. representative explained how Ripple technologies can garner better results compared to other alternatives such as SWIFT:\n\n\u201cToday, for many of us, we may have to go through SWIFT and encounter charges; many intermediary banks are part of that, and typically an SLA for fund transfer or movement is between one and three days.\n\nUsing technology such as Ripple, we can get that done to something like 30 seconds, which is significantly different and at a cheaper cost as well in terms of moving money between our branches, between our different countries within our network. That\u2019s really important to us\u201d\n\nHe also remarked that in spite of evaluating several prospects, the multinational firm is quite satisfied with the results achieved by implementing Ripple\u2019s xCurrent.\n\n\u201cRipple is one of the solutions that we are concentrating. Not the only one, but one that works\u201d\n\nRipple is also involved in multiple remittance plans by other banks in Japan, including SBI Holdings, one of the biggest banks in the country which launched the first bank-owned cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Chase\n\nIt\u2019s surprising to find out that this banking giant associates with crypto technology given its CEO\u2019s harsh stance on digital assets. JP Morgan, on the other hand, is connected to Ripple through its partnership with Al Fardan Exchange LLC, a UAE-based financial provider.\n\nThe institution seeks to utilize RippleNet to process cross border payments fast and cheaply.\n\nUBS\n\nNews of Ripple\u2019s partnership with this institution broke in 2016. UBS was one of the first financial businesses to recognize the value of and agree to test RippleNet\u2019s solution. Chris Larsen, the then-CEO of Ripple, would note this at the time.\n\n\u201cThis is a major step forward for the global financial system, and as the Ripple network grows, together we are paving the way for new connected commerce opportunities and growing demands for real-time, high volume, low value global payments.\u201d\n\nSumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC)\n\nSMBC is one of the many banks that make up the SBI Ripple Asia network. The consortium of banks seeks to use Ripple\u2019s technology to aid with cross border transactions. By teaming up with Ripple, SMBC hopes to conquer the slow and costly pain points that hamper cross border transactions today.\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC)\n\nThis North American banking giant began collaborating with Ripple network earlier this year. As is the case with all the financial institutions on the Ripple roster, the goal is to bolster cross-border payment settlement.\n\nThe partnership came at a crucial moment as Ripple has been embroiled in a battle with the Securities Exchange Commission, but things aren\u2019t looking bad for the blockchain protocol.\n\nNational Bank of Australia (NAB)\n\nNAB\u2019s Ripple association stems from a deal struck with CIBC earlier this year to improve their cross-border payment settlements with each other. Both see potential in Ripple\u2019s ability to deliver cross border payments faster and at lower cost.\n\nPNC Financial Services\n\nPNC might not be the first or second largest bank in America, but it is in the top ten. It boasts over 8 million customers and retail branches in 19 states. The goal is to help its customers get almost instant cross-border payments.\n\nHSBC Holdings PLC\n\nHSBC is the largest bank in Europe. It\u2019s affiliated with Ripplenet through the Saudi British Bank. The goal is to \u201cprovide the best banking services to customers, make use of the latest technology and global banking products available, and create methods and means to save time and effort\u201d for its customers.\n\nCredit Agricole\n\nThis financial giant tapped into the XRP ledger innovation in 2017 to be able to conduct transactions seamlessly across borders. It was one of the first 100 institutions to seek RippleNet service at the time.\n\nBank of America\n\nBAO is another bank that seeks to make use of blockchain technology to aid its processes. Since Ripplenet aims to aid such a bank\u2019s payment system through faster and cheaper cross-border payments. The bank is part of the interbank group for global payments based on blockchain technology.\n\nLearn More About Ripple\n\nWant to learn more about Ripple?
