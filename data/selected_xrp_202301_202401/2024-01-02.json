        "content": "Tue 02 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nWhile Ripple (XRP) is going through a tough phase with a recent underperformance, the cryptocurrency analyst Ben Armstrong has posted a reassuring message for the community invested in this cryptocurrency. Acknowledging the current challenges, he primarily calls for patience and advises against panic selling impulsively. A breakdown of his prudent counsel.\n\nNo Hasty Decisions Out of Frustration\n\nAlthough he readily admits that the performance of Ripple (XRP) has been disappointing relative to other cryptos, Ben Armstrong emphasizes that this should not lead to overreactions. In his view, it would be counterproductive to hastily dispose of one\u2019s XRP out of frustration.\n\nThe analyst insists on the crucial importance of resisting the temptation to sell one\u2019s holdings impulsively and thoughtlessly. Even if Ripple (XRP) seems to lag in the short term, it is better to maintain a long-term perspective and not be swayed by short-term movements.\n\nKeep Cool and Be Patient\n\nIn the face of the inevitable crypto market fluctuations, sometimes puzzling for newcomers, Ben Armstrong hammers home the importance of cultivating essential qualities: composure, patience, and discipline.\n\nRather than reacting viscerally, it is better to analyze the situation with detachment and continue to follow one\u2019s investment plan without being dictated by the prevailing volatility.\n\nArmstrong argues that the most experienced and hardened participants are precisely those who manage to keep their cool under all circumstances. They understand that erratic short-term movements should not lead to a radical change of heart.\n\nEncouraging Signals for a Future Ripple (XRP) Rebound\n\nHowever, Ben Armstrong\u2019s message is not merely a call for calmness and patience. He also conveys a certain optimism regarding the future price development of Ripple (XRP).\n\nIn a recent social media post, Armstrong has expressed enthusiasm: he believes XRP is on the verge of a significant bullish movement by the end of January 2024. He therefore encourages holders to be ready to take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nIn this intervention, Ben Armstrong demonstrates the importance for cryptocurrency investors to adopt the right attitude: sense of perspective, composure, patience, and discipline. Even though Ripple (XRP) is currently going through a difficult period, he urges holders not to give into panic and remains optimistic about its potential. A reassuring message and sage advice for successfully navigating the market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The musicians of Bob Moon\u2019s family had quite a year in 2023.\n\nBob is a regular on the Central Mass. acoustic circuit and the guitarist for popular local bands such as Comanchero, and over the summer, his son Dalton\u2019s duo released the Beatles-inspired \u201cthe pop album,\u201d which made our Favorite New England Albums list.\n\nThen, just a month shy of the year\u2019s end, Ripple Effect, a jam band in which Bob Moon plays guitar, released a wide-ranging EP of their own titled \u201cStorm Rolls In.\u201d\n\nRipple Effect wear their Grateful Dead influence on their sleeves and even in their name, and if you\u2019ve ever put on a Dead album during an hours-long car journey or hung out with stoners of a certain generation, it\u2019s hard not to be reminded of the psychedelic icons while listening to the project.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, though: there\u2019s something here for those who don\u2019t go in for long strange trips, too.\n\nThe project gets rolling with \u201cJunk Train,\u201d a laid-back ramble with a chromatic riff that brings the whole band in every few bars.\n\nLead singer (and Reunion Tap and Table co-owner) Josh Briggs tells a tale of a weary traveler unsure of his next move, trying to enjoy the moment and celebrate his newfound freedom but looking uneasily toward the future.\n\n\u201cI wish someone would just slip me the answer/and send me down the right track,\u201d Briggs sings. \u201cJunk train, I\u2019m heading out West/Junk train, I just got so sick of rain.\u201d\n\nMoon comes in with a pleasant guitar solo toward the end, always returning to the chromatic riff before blasting off again.\n\nMore:Past has presence at new music store in Uxbridge\n\nMore:Selections from what customers at A Great Notion are reading\n\nThe title track, \u201cStorm Rolls In,\u201d is next, and the titular storm\u2019s thunder is the first thing you hear, in the form of a booming drum intro.\n\nNext comes a horn section that sounds like a less festive and more ominous \u201cMexicali Blues,\u201d and then the band pulls back and lets Briggs work, once again weaving a road dweller\u2019s narrative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living on the road since I signed upon that line/I ain\u2019t in no rush, but I\u2019m just running out of time,\u201d Briggs sings.\n\nThis time, he\u2019s not a drifter hopping trains, but a traveling performer who\u2019s made what he feels is a deal with the Devil. His narrator sits somewhere in New Orleans with a pretty woman at his side who reassures him, but he knows she doesn\u2019t understand what he sees: his bad choices, about to catch up with him.\n\nThe dark drums return for a bridge that features a bass solo and the sound of a bar crowd and clinking glasses, and then Moon and bandmates come in with shouts of \u201cOh, storm cloud!\u201d during the last chorus, where Briggs brings it home with \u201cHuman nature wins every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone\u201d is another warm, relaxed jam, the song you hear at a bar when the jam band onstage slowly and gently switches the chord changes away from that extended \u201cFire On The Mountain\u201d and into an original that makes your ears perk up.\n\nIt\u2019s also a plane song, which this column has seen a few of in 2023, and a weed song, which is appropriate given the band\u2019s social media handle: @rippleeffect420.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m high on a plane home to Boston and I\u2019m feeling just fine/She said son, you know you\u2019re never going to learn how to love/If you don\u2019t take a minute to see what\u2019s coming down from above,\u201d Briggs sings. \u201cRound and round we keep climbing, closer to the sun/I\u2019m high on a plane home to Boston and I know we\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nHappy chords and easygoing guitars and drums conjure the blissful effect that you hope getting stoned before a plane trip will have, but the minor chord that hits at the end of each chorus betrays the melancholy beneath the mellow: she\u2019s gone, and she\u2019s not coming back.\n\nJust when listeners have been lulled into a chill, if sad, state, the last of the four tracks on \u201cStorm Rolls In\u201d blasts right through the haze.\n\n\u201cHell Ain\u2019t Deep Enough\u201d starts with twin crunchy guitars and hard and fast drums, and all thoughts of Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir disappear into another first-person tale of debauchery down South.\n\n\u201cSouthbound out of Kentucky, Mississippi River queen/Hot like Memphis summer,\u201d Briggs sings.\n\n\u201cCaptain said this ride ain\u2019t free/Now I know hell ain\u2019t deep enough for me,\u201d the full band sings on the chorus, bringing \u201860s-style harmonies that heighten during the bridge and then drop out before a blistering \u201880s guitar solo.\n\n\u201cBathing in the fire, soaking up the shame/It\u2019s so easy to see/Now I know hell ain\u2019t deep enough for me,\u201d Briggs roars, and then the ride is over before you know it, ending in a blazing, echoing power chord.\n\nThat\u2019s the last thing you hear on \u201cStorm Rolls In,\" and it\u2019s the strong finish that such a banner year for Worcester music deserves.\n\n\"Storm Rolls In\" is available on all streaming services."

        "title": "HSBC takes aim at Revolut and Wise | PaymentsSource - American Banker",
        "content": "Enjoy complimentary access to top ideas and insights \u2014 selected by our editors.\n\nHSBC is adding a new app to attract nonbank customers to cross-border payments. Hollie Adams/Bloomberg\n\nAs the digital payment companies that offer cross-border payments are stacking on financial services to steal business from banks, HSBC is countering by adding a money-transfer app that could serve as a way to enroll new consumers.\n\nHSBC on Tuesday announced Zing, a transfer app that will launch in the coming days in the U.K., with a wider rollout coming later. Zing is designed for users who do not have an HSBC account, enabling it to use the same approach as fintechs that are building \" super apps ,\" or using enrollment in payment accounts as a way to sell broader financial services.\n\nThe launch of Zing places HSBC in a market that banks have largely conceded to companies like Revolut and Wise. But as these nonbanks add more traditional banking and payment services, large banks are more inclined to compete with them \u2014 both to defend their existing businesses and to find new audiences.\n\n\"Cross-border is going to be a major battleground in payments in the next few years as economies strengthen and the globalization of commerce continues,\" said Thad Peterson, a strategic advisor for Datos Insights. \"HSBC's solution is a 'shot across the bow' for players who want to compete for international transaction volume.\"\n\nZing will be available on Apple's App Store and the Google Play platform. Users will be able to store up to 10 currencies in digital wallets with locked-in rates to make payments in local currencies. Consumers can use more than 30 currencies to make international payments using a combination of local and Swift payments.\n\nZing is part of the global HSBC Group, but it is not a bank. It is licensed as an e-money institution by the Financial Conduct Authority. Zing funds are not deposits and as such are not insured by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the U.K.'s version of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Anyone aged 18 or older can apply for the Zing card and app. HSBC already offers a fee-free multi-currency service to retail and wealth clients through its Global Markets product line, whereas Zing is meant to attract new users.\n\n\"A critical element is that Zing is open to non-HSBC customers, although they will obviously try to get you to sign up for their debit card,\" said Aaron McPherson, principal at AFM Consulting. \"It is a crowded space, but there's definitely room for another competitor. I just think the group of banks that could do something like this is fairly small; maybe Citi and a few others. Most would probably want to partner.\"\n\nThe Zing launch follows several other moves at HSBC to expand its digital payments capabilities and to extend access to broader demographics. The bank recently invested $16 million in digital identity firm Yoti, which could help the bank streamline digital ID as a way to enroll new users and authenticate digital payments. HSBC also invested $10 million in Nova Credit , a firm that transfers credit bureau information between countries, making it easier for the bank to offer credit to immigrants.\n\nHSBC did not provide an executive's comment by deadline. In a release, James Allan, founder and CEO of Zing, said: \"Now is the time for a new kind of international payments solution; one that combines cutting-edge innovation with the support of a global bank.\"\n\nInternational payments represent a huge and fast-growing market. Cross-border payments volume is expected to expand from $190 trillion in 2023 to $290 trillion in 2030, according to Statista .\n\nThere are a number of companies that offer cross-border payments. Wise has added partners with payment companies in different countries to make it easier for users to make payments in local currencies. Revolut , which has its roots as a mobile payment company, has added dozens of financial services over the past few years as it attempts to build a financial super app. Ripple has used the technology that supports the XRP token to offer cross-border payments for years, and recently rebranded its cross-border payments unit to address Ripple's attempts to build international networks for digital cross-border payment processing.\n\nThere are also traditional transfer services such as Western Union and MoneyGram that are adding partnerships and expanding their use of automation for their international payment businesses.\n\nIt can be challenging for traditional banks to offer digital cross-border payments, according to analysts. FX and cross-border remittance have long been markets that banks have been willing to cede to others, but as companies like Wise and Revolut have attached more banking-style features, especially cards, it's clear that banks are taking notice, said Aaron Press, research director for worldwide payment strategies at IDC Insights.\n\n\"Banks have a potential advantage if they can gain traction, which is far from guaranteed, as they won't have to share revenue with partners, which should improve margins,\" Press said.\n\nBanks have struggled to match the FX pricing that the specialist startups offer, according to Gareth Lodge, a senior analyst for payments at Celent. \"It's not that they can't, but more that they don't necessarily want to,\" he said.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. Banks may not have a risk appetite, or fear the service may cannibalize their own higher margin transactions or they may avoid the product because the smaller transaction size is not commercially attractive, Lodge said.\n\nGetting into new lines of business can be a double-edged sword for banks, Press said. \"There's a risk that the different investment needs, revenue models and margin expectations will be at odds with the bank's traditional metrics, which can cause challenges.\"\n\n"
