        "title": "Opinion: The ripple effect on the U.S. housing market from China's real estate crisis - HousingWire",
        "content": "The real estate market in China, both commercial and residential, have been unwinding over the last few years. Like a slow-motion train wreck at first, it is now definitively off the rails and heading over a cliff. Following a pattern eerily similar to the U.S. in 2008 and 2009. Lax lending standards and cheap credit, plus a popular belief that real estate values never decline, created a massive bubble.\n\nEarlier this summer, the story of Evergrande\u2019s massive default hit the news, followed by Country Garden\u2019s near failure. Now add in the most recent news of outright fraud and embezzlement by Evergrande executives, and there is a chance the sector will drag down an already slowing Chinese economy.\n\nGlobal economic uncertainty\n\nWith the sheer size of China\u2019s economy, as the saying goes, if they sneeze, the rest of the world could get a cold. Chinese real estate investments extend beyond their borders and if those investors suddenly need to liquidate those assets to cover losses at home, many countries real estate markets could be negatively impacted. In the U.S., some luxury residential markets that saw an influx of Chinese buyers could be particularly vulnerable.\n\nInvestors who have been burned by events in China may also start seeing ghosts in other markets and decide the risk profile is just too unfavorable. This could make raising capital for new construction projects harder, and more expensive, everywhere.\n\nDespite the risks, there are multiple ways events in China could end up benefitting residential real estate in the US.\n\nGrowing demand\n\nWhile there is a chance of real estate assets in the U.S. being liquidated by Chinese owners, the data actually points to the opposite trend. In the 12 months leading up to March 2023, Chinese spending on U.S. residential real estate more than doubled, compared to the previous year.\n\nThis indicates that the U.S. market is viewed as a safe harbor by those in China with capital. Not only are they seeking safer investments, but the continued devaluation of the yuan makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive.\n\nReal estate investors from other countries are also likely to choose the lower risk profile of the US market. Combined, this will support real estate demand and price levels.\n\nInterest rates\n\nThe Fed has already expressed concern about possible ripple effects from China\u2019s economic struggles. If these concerns become serious enough, the Fed could choose to halt, or even reverse rate increases. Regardless of the Fed\u2019s actions, any significant influx of real estate investment from China and other countries will put downward pressure on interest rates.\n\nGiven the deeply interconnected nature of global economies, a crisis anywhere is never \u201cgood news,\u201d and given the size of China\u2019s economy, current events have the potential to send shock waves abroad.\n\nHowever, even bad news often has a silver lining. As the Chinese real estate market declines, the U.S. residential market becomes a relatively safer landing spot for investment. In turn, this capital flow will tend to push down mortgage rates, potentially providing some relief from one of the biggest factors holding the US real estate market back from a full recovery.\n\nVince O\u2019Neill is the chief economist at Plunk.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of HousingWire\u2019s editorial department and its owners.\n\nTo contact the author of this story:\n\nVince O\u2019Neill at [email protected]\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nTracey Velt at [email protected]"

        "title": "Kara Hinds charged with murder for Broad Ripple shooting that killed 3 - IndyStar",
        "content": "A woman is facing multiple murder charges and a reckless homicide charge in connection with a deadly shooting that took three young peoples' lives and left a woman injured in Broad Ripple over the summer.\n\nKara Hinds, 24, is facing two counts of murder, a count of reckless homicide, two counts of battery and a count of criminal recklessness for the early-morning shooting on June 25, 2023 that sent crowds along a busy Broad Ripple Avenue into a panic.\n\nMarion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears said during a Thursday press conference announcing the charges that tension between different groups of people that morning devolved into a fight. After that, \"we end up with multiple shots being fired from multiple firearms,\" Mears said.\n\n\"This appears to be really simple petty disputes,\" he added.\n\nBroad Ripple shooting:Bars set earlier closing time after weekend violence that left 3 dead\n\nThe victims were 24-year-old Tywain Henning, 22-year-old Kaleyia Preer and 22-year-old Christopher Lee Wilson Jr. A fourth person was hit by gunfire, but survived.\n\n'I'm about to shoot everywhere'\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit, an Indianapolis police detective received a string of emails from tipsters with social media video clips of the fight Mears referenced as well as information on possible suspects.\n\nA \"person of interest\" was eventually identified after the detective spoke to people with knowledge of what happened. The descriptions of a suspect aligned with Hinds' appearance in videos reviewed by detectives, the affidavit says.\n\nOne witness, identified only by their initials in the affidavit, picked out Hinds as the shooter when a detective presented a photo array.\n\n\"I don't give a ****, I'm about to shoot everywhere,\" the witness allegedly heard Hinds say.\n\n'Unimaginable and horrific':Broad Ripple Village seeks gun-free zone designation for weekends after deadly shooting\n\nThen someone punched Hinds in the back of the head, the witness said, and Hinds turned around and started firing.\n\nThe witness said they saw Wilson and Henning die. Both of the men were armed at the time, the witness said, but it was not clear if anyone in the group fighting with Hinds fired shots because \u201cit was so chaotic.\"\n\nDetective interviews Kara Hinds about the Broad Ripple shooting\n\nDetectives detained Hinds at an apartment on the north side on Sept. 28 and brought her in for questioning. At first, she didn't acknowledge being in Broad Ripple when the shooting occurred. But as a detective pressed her further, she allegedly admitted to being there and playing a role in the violence.\n\nHinds said she \"felt like she was defending herself,\" according to police.\n\nThe affidavit claims she identified the other group as a threat after she was physically attacked. She couldn't tell if anyone in the other group fired back at her, police said.\n\nInvestigators also collected firearm evidence from the scene that was linked back to Hinds' Glock pistol through forensic testing.\n\nOp/Ed:It's about more than guns in Broad Ripple. We need to tackle basic problems, too.\n\nFourth shooting victim is still recovering\n\nDuring the Thursday press conference, Mears described the scene on June 25 as a disaster waiting to happen.\n\n\"There was a lot of drinking going on,\" he said, \"and you cannot ignore the fact that there were way too many people who were armed.\"\n\nIMPD Deputy Chief Kendale Adams, who joined Mears on Thursday, said the fourth shooting victim is still recovering. He decried the shooting as senseless, but said he is glad \"we at least have started the process of holding someone accountable for that crime.\"\n\nCall IndyStar courts reporter Johnny Magdaleno at 317-273-3188 or email him at jmagdaleno@indystar.com.
