        "content": "According to a recent Bloomberg article, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC0 latest surge could be the beginning of a new cycle that takes the original cryptocurrency to $500,000. However, if Bitcoin reaches $500k, other altcoins, such as Ripple\u2019s XRP token, could follow suit.\n\nWhile asking Google\u2019s Bard AI (Artificial Intelligence) about XRP\u2019s price when Bitcoin (BTC) hits $500k, the AI chatbot gave three potential scenarios.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple XRP: Weekly $100 Since Launch Is Worth This Much Today\n\nIn its most moderate scenario, Ripple\u2019s XRP token could reach a price of about $1.5 or $3 if Bitcoin\u2019s spike continues. The price spike translates to a maximum growth of around 383% from current levels. In this case, XRP\u2019s price increase may not be proportional to BTC due to its legal uncertainty.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Bard also gives a strong outlook for XRP, given a favorable outcome in its legal battle, predicting a price of $5 to $10. The increase would translate to a maximum growth of about 1512% from current price levels.\n\nLastly, Google\u2019s Bard also gives an optimistic scenario where Ripple\u2019s XRP token\u2019s price surges beyond $10. XRP\u2019s price could surge beyond $10 if Ripple gains significant ground in global finances via its cross-border and remittance settlements. Moreover, the fintech company could see an increase in institutional partnerships, further pushing XRP\u2019s price.\n\nWhen will Ripple\u2019s XRP hit $3 or $10?\n\nSource \u2013 Bitcoin.com\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg article, Bitcoin (BTC) could go \u201cfrom $50,000 in the immediate term to above $530,000.\u201d However, the report does not give any specific timeline for BTC\u2019s price surge.\n\nAlso Read Ripple XRP Forecasted to Rally 1500% to $10: Here is When\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that BTC will surge to beyond $500k in the next bull run. Nonetheless, many expect the original cryptocurrency to hit 6-figures sometime this decade. On the other hand, Ripple\u2019s XRP is seeing a lot of interest among institutions for cross-border settlements. With a high chance of the court ruling in Ripple\u2019s favor, we may see a surge in the token\u2019s price and adoption."

        "content": "A veteran Richmond bartender is stepping out on her own with a spot in Carytown.\n\nKatie Jarvis is preparing to open Ripple Ray\u2019s at 3123 W. Cary St. The new Southern-style bar and restaurant will be replacing Town Hall, which ended a roughly three-year run earlier this year.\n\nJarvis is taking over the spot after acquiring Town Hall\u2019s assets for an undisclosed amount last month. Rich Holden of Holden Realty worked the deal.\n\nFor much of the last 15 years, the Cary Street space had been home to Weezie\u2019s Kitchen. In early 2020 Weezie\u2019s closed, and the space was picked up by Belmont Food Shop owner Mike Yavorsky, who opened Town Hall. While Belmont Food Shop offers an upscale, chef-driven menu, Town Hall was more of a neighborhood dive serving traditional bar fare.\n\nThe space in the heart of Carytown is familiar ground for Jarvis, who said she tended bar at Town Hall for about two years after stints at Fan bars like F.W. Sullivan\u2019s, Lady N\u2019awlins and Pik Nik. When she heard Yavorsky was looking to sell, Jarvis said she felt she had to jump on it.\n\n\u201cI loved Town Hall and all the regulars that came in,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cI just thought it would be a great opportunity to open a place of my own.\u201d\n\nYavorsky couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nJarvis said basically everything at Ripple Ray\u2019s will be different from Town Hall, and one change she\u2019s planning is the addition of a retractable stage in the rear of the dining room.\n\n\u201cDuring restaurant dining hours, we\u2019re going to be lifting the stage and it\u2019s going to become an art piece on the wall. Then when dinner service hours are over, we\u2019ll adjust that down and have local musicians come in,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to bring in a lot of local artists to perform.\u201d\n\nRipple Ray\u2019s menu will include Southern-style, upscale bar food, Jarvis said, noting that she\u2019s working on a cocktail menu as well.\n\nJarvis is leasing the roughly 2,000-square-foot space from the Chiocca family, who has owned the building since the late 1990s when they bought it for $150,000, city records show.\n\nRipple Ray\u2019s is named after one of Jarvis\u2019 favorite songs by the Grateful Dead, \u201cRipple,\u201d as well as her late father.\n\n\u201cMy father, who passed away when I was little, his name was Ray and he was a scuba diver,\u201d she said. \u201cSo \u2018Ripple\u2019 kind of ties in that too. It\u2019s very symbolic.\u201d\n\nRipple Ray\u2019s will be at least the second Grateful Dead-inspired spot in the region: Crazy Rooster Brewing Co. in Powhatan is named after a song by the prolific jam band.\n\nJarvis said she\u2019s hoping to open Ripple Ray\u2019s in the spring.\n\n\u201cAs a bartender, this is what you kind of like always dream of: having a place of your own. And I\u2019m making that a reality,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy but I\u2019m very excited.\u201d\n\nA few doors down from Ripple Ray\u2019s is Anthony\u2019s Pizza Carytown, another new restaurant that opened earlier this year."

        "content": "The question of why we exist has a plethora of unreasonable answers tied to it. At the heart of the query lies the butterfly effect, the idea that a seemingly trivial action can set off a chain reaction with monumental consequences worldwide. This unique and riveting idea is presented in the 1946 Christmas classic \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d It is a movie based on \u201cThe Greatest Gift\u201d by Philip Van Doren Stern that resonated with the essence of Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Carol.\u201d The film encapsulates and exhibits the Christmas spirit of tropes and cliches insofar as \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d doesn\u2019t just exemplify this; it is the story of Christmas.\n\nThe opening scene presents a character named George Bailey, played by James Stewart, contemplating ending his life on a bridge amidst a wintry backdrop, setting the stage for a movie of despair. However, his innate altruism intervenes when he saves another man from drowning, a gesture that unexpectedly alters his fate. George saves Clarence, portrayed by Henry Travers, who reveals himself as a second-class angel through his seemingly omnipotent powers. Clarence is the archetypal of guardian angel stories, evoking the iconic line, \u201cEvery time a bell rings, an Angel gets its wings.\u201d\n\nThis movie follows the trajectory of the Ebenezer Scrooge-type story, showing flashbacks of George Bailey\u2019s past life. It shows that George epitomizes a life not of acclaim or riches but a life guided by a deep-seated sense of duty and morality, with his unwavering commitment to doing what he believes is right. This is an essential aspect of the story, as it doesn\u2019t try to depict George as a sad figure teetering on edge; it portrays him as content and hopeful until he is thrust into a situation that plunges him into his nadir. \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d shows that no matter who it is, everyone hits a low point and that, sometimes, the people who look the happiest are suffering the most in disguise.\n\nClarence enlightens George by revealing his loving wife, Mary Hatch, played by Donna Reed, and his children evoked a prayer to an angel to bring him home. The angel then goes on to reveal to George pivotal moments from his life where he does amazing things that change others\u2019 lives.\n\nJames Stewart\u2019s portrayal elevates this movie to new heights. He draws from his experiences as a recent WW2 veteran, showing almost haunting emotions. For example, the scene of George in a bar after contemplating suicide gave an artistic emotion of crying, sorrow and suffering. Moments like these led to his nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards for the third time.\n\nThe story truly shines at its climax when George condescendingly says, \u201cI wish I were never born.\u201d This moment lights a bulb in Clarence\u2019s mind because of the famous adage, \u201cBe careful about what you wish for.\u201d Clarence grants his wish, and George is brought into a reality where he never existed. \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d demonstrates its true colors by taking a symbolic meaning into a literal one, with George seeing his wish become a horrifying reality. In a final plea, George returns to the bridge, begging for his old life, realizing his life is not forfeited.\n\nGeorge returns and receives a book titled \u201cNo Man Is a Failure Without Friends.\u201d With a new profound perspective, George Bailey realizes he truly has a wonderful life. The film was originally a box office failure despite its numerous Academy Awards and only gained widespread recognition in 1974 when it became public domain, allowing millions across the U.S. to watch it freely.\n\nHundreds of references still exist in some form today when watching the movie, from the film\u2019s production to the timeless quotes that make it an unbeatable masterpiece. \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d weaves a tapestry of emotions, reminding everyone that amidst despair, hope and the power to transform your reality are part of your everyday choices to make your life wonderful."

        "content": "Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.\n\nTrading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency.\n\nMarket capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset\u2019s current market value. For Bitcoin, the market capitalization at the beginning of August 2023 is above $570 billion, which is the result of the more than 19 million BTC in circulation multiplied by the Bitcoin price around $29,600.\n\nThe developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. Since its inception, a total of 19,445,656 BTCs have been mined, which is the circulating supply of Bitcoin. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains.\n\nXRP price is nearly 17% away from the target. The altcoin has support of the 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.6209. In its rally towards the $0.7500 target, XRP price could face resistance at the 50% retracement level ($0.6820) of the decline from its July 13 local top of $0.9403 to the August 17 bottom of $0.4237.\n\nXRP price has been trending below the $0.6500 mark since the beginning of December 2023. XRP\u2019s uptrend remains intact and the altcoin is likely to attempt a comeback to the $0.7500 level, previously seen on November 13.\n\nRipple (XRP) remains a talking point among retail market participants that expect a settlement in the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) lawsuit against the cross-border payment remittance firm. Amidst talks of settlement, there is a notable spike in the XRP transaction count.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
