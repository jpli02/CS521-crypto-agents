        "content": "Wall Street financial expert Linda Jones has given specific calendar dates for the XRP and the broader crypto community to expect a Ripple IPO.\n\nThe timeline marks the potential transition of Ripple into a publicly traded company through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Jones shared insights into the possible dates for Ripple IPO in a recent Fireside chat with the pre-IPO investment platform Linqto.\n\nHere is my interview with Linqto today. We talked about when Ripple might go public, my back of the envelope calculation for what the stock might be worth and potential acquisition targets. #xrp #xrparmy #ripple #Uphold #linqto @linqto #polysign #preipo #privateequity\u2026 \u2014 Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) November 17, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to Jones, Ripple may not necessarily require funds from an IPO. However, she noted that Ripple\u2019s executives might be pressured to conduct the IPO as investors might seek such a route to exit.\n\nFurthermore, the expert contended that despite Ripple not needing funds from an IPO, a confluence of factors, including a predicted bull market resulting from decreased inflation and interest rates, could create an opportune moment for companies to go public.\n\nIn this context, Jones expressed her belief in a robust IPO market next year. She noted it opens a window for companies to capitalize on the projected favorable market conditions.\n\nRipple IPO in May 2024 or 2025\n\nBased on the anticipated boom in the IPO market by 2024, the financial expert argued that May 2024, specifically May 15, would be the ideal time for Ripple to go public.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity if Ripple wants to go public next year, that mid-May would be an ideal time, right around May 15,\u201d Jones remarked.\n\nShe noted the date to be the first target to look for Ripple\u2019s IPO. However, the Wall Street expert emphasized that the timeline is contingent on various factors, including the anticipated stock market boom, aligning perfectly.\n\nMeanwhile, Jones highlighted that where Ripple fails to make the IPO in May, there may be no other dates for a 2024 IPO. Specifically, she argued that Ripple would not conduct an IPO until 2025. In her words:\n\n\u201cIf everything \u2013 the stars, the Sun, and the Moon \u2013 lined up and they wanted to go public, that might be my first target date [May 2024]. If it doesn\u2019t happen, then I think it probably wouldn\u2019t happen until 2025.\u201d\n\nNo IPO While Legal Battle Subsists\n\nNotably, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently commented on Ripple\u2019s anticipated IPO timeline. Garlinghouse stated that Ripple cannot go public amid the legal battle with the U.S. regulator.\n\nSpecifically, Garlinghouse noted that approval from the SEC for Ripple\u2019s Form S-1 Registration Statement is a prerequisite for an IPO, and this approval is unlikely to occur as long as the legal conflict persists."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto tracking platform Whale Alert has detected two large XRP transactions made by an anonymous wallet to major exchanges Bitstamp and Bitso.\n\nWith these transfers, more than 51,000,000 XRP coins were shoveled. Details of these transactions, however, suggest that the sender wallet may be affiliated with Ripple Labs blockchain behemoth.\n\nAlso, transfers to the exchanges, with a likely goal of selling those millions of XRP, coincided with a 5.11% drop in the XRP price. In this case, the aforementioned wallet made a massive XRP sale at a loss.\n\nClose to 52 million XRP on the move, price declines\n\nPer data published by Whale Alert, unknown wallet r4wf7enWPxyHtbizyV7ZHiZi5XgwHh4Rzn moved lumps of 25,400,000 XRP and 26,200,000 XRP roughly 11 hours ago. The millions of XRP were sent to Bitstamp and Bitso exchanges, respectively \u2013 a total of 51,600,000 XRP worth $31.7 million in fiat.\n\nIn the meantime, the price of the Ripple-affiliated XRP coin demonstrated a 5.11% decline since Thursday as it dropped from the $0.65098 level and is now changing hands at $0.61576.\n\nThis week has been rough for XRP as it first plunged more than 12% on Monday after BlackRock fund manager dismissed scam rumors about it filing for an XRP-based ETF. Then another 10% drop came on Tuesday as the case with the fraudulent XRP ETF filing was transferred to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThis case with a fake XRP ETF filing became a target for memes which, these days, is a likely sign that demand for such an exchange-traded fund would perhaps be quite high among investors and traders.\n\nHere's where Ripple's shadow is seen on transfers\n\nXRP-centered explorer Bithomp revealed that the aforementioned r4wf7enWPxyHtbizyV7ZHiZi5XgwHh4Rzn wallet is linked to the fintech heavyweight Ripple based in San Francisco.\n\nTherefore, this 51,600,000 XRP transfer was likely to have been made not for the sake of selling and adding fiat funds to Ripple's balance but as transactions to support the Ripple Payments liquidity supply.\n\nRipple Payments used to be known to the crypto community as On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), but it was rebranded earlier this year to make it easier for outsiders to understand quickly what this system is about.\n\nRipple Payments runs on RippleNet, and it is powered by XRP, which is the core element of transactions here, and they do not require dealing with prepaid accounts as opposed to money transfers conducted by traditional banks. This system currently operates in more than 70 countries around the world, according to data shared by Ripple chief Brad Garlinghouse at the recent annual Swell event in the UAE."

        "content": "Bitcoin price remains under the $36,500 level as the absence of momentum leaves BTC susceptible to a slump.\n\nEthereum price risks at least 5% slump to the $1,864 level if it loses critical support at $1,935.\n\nRipple price risks a 10% drop to the late October lows if the support at $0.5981 gives way.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains steadfast below the $36,500 level as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) misses its target. Nevertheless, a new development concerning the sane has equally not done anything for BTC, with ETF specialist Erica Balchunas saying the financial regulator wants ETFs to do cash creats.\n\nMeanwhile, both Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are losing ground as profit taking escalates.\n\nAlso Read: SEC allegedly wants spot Bitcoin ETFs to do cash creates, not crypto, after possible meet-up with exchanges\n\nBitcoin price likely to drop\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains trapped under the $36,500 level as hope for a spot BTC ETF approval in 2023 wears thin. All indicators show that momentum is waning due to multiple sell-signals in play. This leaves the king of cryptocurrency susceptible to a fall.\n\nUnless sidelined investors enter the fold, Bitcoin price could lose the support offered by the ascending trendline at $35,410. The ensuing selling pressure would then likely plunge BTC to $34,000.\n\nFurther, south, the slump could see Bitcoin price extend below the $32,000 mark before a test of the bullish breaker extending from $30,126 to $31,524. A break and close below the midline of this order block at $30,824 is likely to send BTC to the forecasted $30,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased buying pressure could see Bitcoin price confirm its move north above the supply zone extending from $36,276 to $37,301 by decisively closing above the $36,788 level. Past this level, the likely move would be to clear the $37,972 barrier before an extension to the $40,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price hit $38,000 despite US financial regulator\u2019s decision to delay two BTC ETF decisions\n\nEthereum price losing $1,935 support will be detrimental to ETH holders\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is testing the critical support at $1,935, and losing this level could send the largest altcoin by trading volume to the depths of $1,864, 5% below current levels.\n\nIn a more dire case, the fall could extend toward the $1,800 psychological level with the next support level likely to present itself around the $1,753 mark.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if the $1,935 mean threshold and ultimately the order block spanning from $1,864 to $2,004 holds as a support level, Ethereum price could pull north, restoring above the ascending trendline at $2,029.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend to the $2,136 range high, with such a move constituting a 10% climb above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum is a commodity, but SEC will not admit it, expert says amid ongoing ETF race\n\nRipple price extends fall with 10% pullback possibly in the cards\n\nRipple (XRP) price could fall 10% below the $0.5981 support level to test the $0.5392 support, as the remittance token continues to extend its losses after breaking out of the symmetrical triangle.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows momentum is falling as it nosedives south, mirrored by the Awesome Oscillator (AO), whose histogram bars are soaked in red and edging south. This adds credence to the bearish thesis.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, a re-entry by sidelined investors and late bloomers could see Ripple price correct, pulling north and potentially restoring above the lower boundary of the triangle at $0.6603. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extrapolate past the $0.0700 psychological level, balancing out the inefficiency represented by the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $0.7512 with the potential to hit the $0.8000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price fails to show parity with Ripple\u2019s important victory over SEC, 5% pullback seems likely"

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nIn a striking social media post, Stuart Alderoty, the Chief Legal Officer of Ripple, has drawn a bold comparison between gary gensler gary gensler Gary Gensler is an enthusiastic leader and the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He has the extreme experience that spans wall street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. He announced several initiatives to enhance investor protections in the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market. He previously led the Biden-Harris transition\u2019s federal reserve, Banking, and securities regulation agency review team. He was awarded Treasury's highest honor, the Alexander Hamilton Award, and also was a recipient of the 2014 Frankel Fiduciary Prize. He was born on October 18, 1957, into a Jewish family, in Baltimore, Maryland. Graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Master's degree in Business Administration. Additionally, he is also a professor at the MIT Sloan School of management. He has served in various governmental roles since the 1990s, such as the treasury department, Sarbanes-Oxley, CFTC, Swaps, Enforcement, Libor investigation, Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission, Securities, and Exchange Commission. Gary Gensler will probably keep on filling in as seat of the SEC until 2026, accepting his renunciation. He has expressed his desires to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. A few officials as well as his kindred SEC magistrates have scrutinized Gensler for not giving adequate administrative direction on crypto, possibly prompting a standoff between Congress and the association. The SEC, CFTC, and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network handle advanced resource guidelines in the U.S., however, each with various jurisdictional cases, bringing about an interwoven methodology that crypto firms should explore to work legitimately. Whether 2022 will see a more clear way for organizations in the crypto space is questionable, yet the cosmetics of the SEC's initiative will fundamentally change following the takeoff of chief Elad Roisman in the first month of the year. Chief Allison Lee's term is likewise set to terminate in June 2022. Chairman , the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and a fictional character, Colonel Nathan Roy Jessup, from Aaron Sorkin\u2019s acclaimed play \u2018A Few Good Men.\u2019 Alderoty\u2019s comparison suggests that Gensler, like Col. Jessup, is unyielding and unaccustomed to being challenged.\n\nThe SEC is losing in court; being criticized by Judges for shady behavior; being rebuked by the Gov\u2019t\u2019s internal auditor; hiding info about meetings with a felon; becoming irrelevant on the international stage. Gensler \u2013 admitting no fault \u2013 has become the insulate Col. Jessep. pic.twitter.com/vqjPPcifr8 \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) November 16, 2023\n\nThe Ripple CLO\u2019s criticism stems from Gensler\u2019s recent conduct in legal settings, media interviews, and parliamentary appearances. Alderoty highlighted various aspects of Gensler\u2019s personality that have drawn scrutiny, including allegations of opaque behavior, criticism from government auditors, secretive meetings, and a diminishing global influence.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple\u2019s Legal Milestone: The Three Key Outcomes Since July 2023\n\nThis critique comes amid escalating tensions between the SEC and the cryptocurrency market. Representative Tom Emmer has proposed restricting the SEC\u2019s authority over cryptocurrencies until Congress establishes clear regulations. However, Gensler remains firm in his stance, ready to confront crypto advocates, reminiscent of the unflinching character of Col. Jessup.\n\nDuring a recent testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, Gensler faced accusations of consolidating power at the expense of Americans\u2019 financial opportunities. Despite this, Gensler defended the SEC\u2019s impartial approach to technology and stressed the need for nuanced compliance in the cryptocurrency industry, likening the current situation to the pre-regulatory era of the 1920s.\n\nIn the Ripple case, the SEC focuses not on the classification of XRP as a security but instead on the legality of Ripple\u2019s secondary sales of XRP. This approach underlines the SEC\u2019s interest in Ripple\u2019s alleged violations rather than the broader classification of XRP as a security.\n\nAs the legal and regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, this conflict between Ripple and the SEC is a focal point for broader debates about the future of digital assets and their regulation."
