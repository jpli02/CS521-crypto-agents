        "content": "In a recent collaborative endeavor, IBM and Metaco, an affiliate of Ripple, have unveiled the IBM Hyper Protect Offline Signing Orchestrator (OSO), an advanced technology aimed to elevate digital asset storage for financial institutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoving away from methods, this innovation simplifies operations by eliminating manual processes and integrating sophisticated security measures. These include disconnected network operations, time-based security protocols and the electronic approval of transactions by multiple stakeholders.\n\nAt its core, OSO's policy engine serves as the linchpin, fostering secure communication between two deliberately noninteracting applications. This strategic design not only surmounts the limitations of existing cold storage offerings but also strives to establish an efficient and secure framework for transactions involving digital assets.\n\nWe worked with our partner @IBM to help build Hyper Protect Offline Signing Orchestrator (OSO) \u2014 a new technology to deploy #coldstorage for #digitalassets, which addresses the requirements of top-tier banks and financial institutions.\n\n\n\nDive deeper:https://t.co/BaQSiufPso pic.twitter.com/Rk37qQnHzy \u2014 Metaco (@metaco_sa) December 6, 2023\n\nThrough a collaborative effort with Metaco, a digital asset custody provider under the umbrella of Ripple, IBM has intricately tailored OSO to meet the distinct requirements of its clients.\n\nThe synchronized synergy between OSO and Metaco's orchestration system achieves a seamless transaction environment, reducing exposure to digital assets in cold storage. This pragmatic alternative to current solutions empowers clients to implement institutional cold storage technologies in line with their unique management models.\n\nRipple's acquisition of Metaco in May 2023 marked a pivotal juncture, broadening the portfolio of the blockchain and crypto solutions giant and introducing innovative revenue streams.\n\nThe introduction of the joint project with IBM now positions Ripple and Metaco as trailblazers in reshaping solutions for financial institutions, offering a highly practical alternative in the continually evolving landscape of digital asset storage."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nRipple\u2019s legal battle with the SEC continues, awaiting a resolution in spring 2024 despite rumors of an early settlement.\n\nA July ruling favored Ripple by stating past XRP sales weren\u2019t investment contract offers, leading to a temporary advantage in the ongoing case.\n\nRipple won partial victories including dismissal of SEC appeals and clearing of executive charges, with a decisive April trial anticipated to influence the crypto sector\u2019s outlook.\n\nWhat\u2019s New Around the Ripple vs. SEC Saga?\n\nThe ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn\u2019t offered much action lately and seems to be waiting for the resolution next year. Still, there are a few developments that are worth observing.\n\nFor one, America\u2019s securities regulator convened a confidential meeting at the end of November where it touched upon specific topics, including Institution and settlement of injunctive actions, Institution and settlement of administrative proceedings, Resolution of litigation claims, and others.\n\nThis gave conspiracy theory fans the opportunity to speculate that some kind of resolution between the SEC and Ripple might be announced earlier than expected. However, this wasn\u2019t the case, and the lawsuit remains to be resolved in the spring of 2024.\n\nA Brief Recap of the Ripple/SEC Clash\n\nThe whole drama between the two entities started in December 2020 when the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, accusing it of selling XRP (the native token of the blockchain enterprise) in an unregistered security offering.\n\nThe battle has gone through numerous stages, with both organizations firing shots at each other. A pivotal moment occurred in mid-July this year when a US Federal Judge ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales from years ago did not constitute an offer of investment contracts. This boosted the price of the asset and gave the crypto firm a temporary upper hand in the clash.\n\nMoreover, Ripple secured two additional partial victories in the following months. The American magistrates dismissed the SEC\u2019s attempt to appeal the initial decision, whereas CEO \u2013 Brad Garlinghouse \u2013 and Executive Chairman \u2013 Chris Larsen \u2013 were cleared of all charges brought by the watchdog.\n\nA grand trial scheduled for April next year is supposed to reveal the outcome of the lengthy saga. A possible decisive win for Ripple could trigger further enthusiasm in the entire cryptocurrency sector, while an SEC victory could have the opposite effect."

        "title": "More construction coming to Broad Ripple - WTHR",
        "content": "The new project will repair the Westfield Boulevard bridge that passes over the canal.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Businesses in downtown Broad Ripple are bracing for another construction project that is set to start next week.\n\nIt will focus on repairing and replacing the Westfield Boulevard bridge that goes over the canal.\n\nThe announcement comes as crews are finishing up an almost two-year project on Broad Ripple Avenue.\n\nA Indianapolis Department of Public Works public meeting is set for Thursday night to discuss the plans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. It doesn\u2019t seem real or right that this can happen,\u201d said Chelsey Wetzel, the owner of Union Jack Pub.\n\nWetzel said her business hasn\u2019t recovered from the last project and that she didn\u2019t know about this new project until Monday.\n\n\u201cWhat has been forced upon us is not sustainable for small businesses, and it\u2019s not OK, and it\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d Wetzel said.\n\nShe\u2019s not alone. Cocktail bar Thieves also posted on Facebook telling Indy DPW, \u201cWe don\u2019t want you in Broad Ripple.\u201d Other businesses like 317 BBQ and Fire by the Monon echoed that same message.\n\nHowever, businesses like the Bungalow said the improvements are worth the construction headache.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an eyesore, so I am glad something is going to happen with it,\u201d said Jennifer Velesco, the co-owner of the shop. \u201cI am excited to see what our village can look like when this is over.\u201d\n\nVelesco and several other business owners plan to attend Thursday night\u2019s meeting with DPW.\n\nIt is happening at 6:30 p.m. Dec. 7 at the Indianapolis Arts Center\u2019s auditorium. Anyone can attend.\n\nMore on the project\n\nIndy DPW told 13News that this project was planned a few years ago and that it is necessary to do it now.\n\n\u201cWe understand frustrations that residents and business owners have had over another project beginning in Broad Ripple; however, there are a few important facts to recognize regarding the Westfield Boulevard Bridge replacement,\u201d an Indy DPW representative said. \u201cIndy DPW takes public safety very seriously, and bridge replacement \u2014 which is a public safety matter \u2014 has several considerations when looking at the coordination and timing for construction.\u201d\n\nThe representative said the city is coordinating with Citizens Energy because work inside the canal can only happen between Jan. 15 through April 15 due to seasonal restraints. To reach that deadline, the department said pre-construction work has to be done now to be ready to go.\n\nThe project also uses federal funding for most of the cost and requires oversight from INDOT.\n\n\u201cIf we were to try and delay this project any further, we run the risk of losing that federal funding. With a total project cost of $4.7 million, the federal funding is critical to making sure this project is able to move forward. INDOT also has specifics for timelines that this project needs to abide by,\u201d the Indy DPW representative said.\n\nThe statement went on to say, \u201cThis project is another example of the city's investment into Broad Ripple's infrastructure. With millions of dollars invested into the infrastructure of this neighborhood, we believe that the positive impacts of these investments will maintain Broad Ripple\u2019s place as one of our city\u2019s finest cultural districts \u2013 long outlasting the disruption that construction inevitably brings with it.\u201d\n\nCitizens Energy Group said crews will first remove a water main and set up a temporary main to ensure water supply to the area during the project.\n\nDuring that time, the northbound lane of East Westfield Boulevard between the bridge and 64th Street will be restricted. That will occur on weekdays between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. for two weeks starting on or after Dec. 11."

        "content": "Security Council Meets on Maintenance of Peace and Security of Ukraine. UN Photo/Eskinder Debebe\n\nMR. RAMESH RAJASINGHAM, OCHA DIRECTOR OF COORDINATION, ON BEHALF OF UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS AND EMERGENCY RELIEF COORDINATOR, MR. MARTIN GRIFFITHS\n\nBriefing to the UN Security Council on humanitarian situation in Ukraine\n\n6 December 2023\n\nAs prepared for delivery\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nAs you have just heard from Assistant Secretary-General Jen\u010da, civilians in Ukraine continue to pay a heavy price for this war.\n\nIf the brutal impact of more than 21 months of fighting since February 2022 were not enough, millions of children, women and men are now faced with the prospect of yet another winter of severe hardship amid the impact of increased attacks on hospitals, electricity transmission systems, and gas and water supplies.\n\nThe deaths, injuries and level of destruction of vital civilian infrastructure is staggering.\n\nMany people have been left without access to heat, electricity, and water, particularly in the east and south.\n\nAmid freezing temperatures, this damage is particularly threatening the survival of the most vulnerable \u2013 among them the elderly and those with disabilities \u2013 who are already suffering because of disruption to essential services caused by the war.\n\nThe situation is deeply concerning.\n\nI must reiterate that international humanitarian law is very clear: attacks must never be directed against civilians or civilian objects and constant care must be taken to spare them at all times.\n\nMr. President,\n\nThe work of humanitarians is aimed at saving lives and safeguarding dignity in the midst of disaster and war.\n\nThis remains our steadfast objective in Ukraine.\n\nSo far in 2023, almost 560 humanitarian partners \u2013 the majority of them local organizations \u2013 have provided life-critical aid and protection services to more than 10 million people.\n\nThe commitment and endurance shown by these organisations in delivering this response is truly admirable \u2013 particularly now, as they work against the clock and the elements to support civilians with the services and supplies, they need to see them through the harsh winter.\n\nIn recent weeks, humanitarians have provided more than 361,000 people with some form of direct winter assistance, including winter heating, repair and maintenance of energy and heating systems and much-needed home repair materials.\n\nSimilar efforts continue in response to wider needs across all affected areas of Ukraine.\n\nLast week, a landmark 100th interagency convoy for 2023 reached Chasiv Yar. Throughout the year, these convoys have provided critical assistance to almost 400,000 people in hard-hit front-line communities across oblasts from Kharkiv, to Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Kherson, and Sumy.\n\nThis support was substantially buttressed by deliveries from smaller individual organizations.\n\nAnd they have taken place against the backdrop of significant obstacles: the lack of humanitarian access across the frontline in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, remains the biggest challenge.\n\nAt this juncture, I must underscore that under international humanitarian law, humanitarian access must be allowed and facilitated for all civilians in need, no matter where they live.\n\nObstructions that leave civilians without the essentials to survive are contrary to international humanitarian law.\n\nAnother major concern for frontline communities is the presence of landmines and other unexploded ordnance, which are causing tragic avoidable casualties and significantly hindering community recovery.\n\nHumanitarian mine action is critical to prevent further civilian casualties, especially among children.\n\nMr. President,\n\nNone of this vital humanitarian work would be possible without the incredible donor support to the Ukraine Humanitarian Response Plan, which has received $2.3 billion of the $3.9 billion required in 2023.\n\nBut the $1.6 billion shortfall is still substantial. It means civilians have been left without life-saving shelter; women, girls and boys face the risks of violence and exploitation; interruptions to lifesaving primary healthcare are putting people\u2019s life in danger; civilians will not be able to protect or restore their food production and livelihoods, further affecting their food insecurity.\n\nContinued financial support is critical to sustain humanitarian operations to the end of 2023, in to 2024, and as long as civilians endure the war\u2019s terrible toll.\n\nMr. President,\n\nDespite the continued attacks on ports and grain infrastructure highlighted by Assistant Secretary-General Jen\u010da, exports from Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports through the new corridors announced in August have steadily increased.\n\nThe UN estimates that some 7 million metric tons of commodities have been transported through these corridors, of which around 70 per cent are understood to be grains and other foodstuffs.\n\nTaking into account other routes, the overall volume of foodstuffs exported from Ukraine last month was comparable to November of last year.\n\nHowever, significant risks due to air strikes and sea mines remain, and Ukraine\u2019s deep-sea ports continue to operate significantly below their potential capacity.\n\nIn an incident on 16 November, explosions rocked an outbound bulk carrier loaded with wheat. Thankfully the vessel was not badly damaged and was able to continue its journey.\n\nHigh levels of agricultural exports from the Russian Federation continue, primarily via the Black Sea, with the Russian Agriculture Ministry reporting expectations of very large grain harvests in 2023.\n\nLast month the Russian Federation also reported the transportation of a first tranche of a total of 200,000 metric tons of grain donations pledged to six African countries.\n\nThe FAO Food Price Index has continued to trend downwards, with drops in international cereal prices among the drivers of this.\n\nBut volatility persists and we continue to emphasize the imperative of ensuring that all sources of food exports are safely and sustainably connected to global supply chains.\n\nThe Secretary-General continues his active engagement in support of this.\n\nMr. President,\n\nWhile Ukraine remains under attack and in a state of conflict, the conditions that are causing such devastation and misery, and the ripple effects around the world, will persist.\n\nAs we come to the end of 2023 and enter 2024, we must redouble our efforts to prevent further escalation in Ukraine.\n\nTogether you must do everything within your power to end this tragic war.\n\nThank you."

        "title": "Myanmar Coup Interview Series: 'We must not overlook the ripple effect of coups happening globally' - JURIST",
        "content": "In the nearly three years that have passed since Myanmar\u2019s coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, the global media has shifted its attention to other crises, from the sudden withdrawal of Western forces from Afghanistan to Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. But despite a lull in headlines, the turmoil that resulted from the coup remains life-altering for the generation of young activists who have been displaced by the shattering of democratic ideals.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s military \u2014 the Tatmadaw \u2014 staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat on February 1, 2021, detaining top government officials, including Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint. The military claimed that the election results were fraudulent, but independent observers have dismissed these claims. The coup has sparked widespread protests and civil disobedience, with many people calling for the release of the detained leaders and the restoration of democracy. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a human rights organization dedicated to justice in Myanmar, more than 4,000 people have so far been killed by Myanmar\u2019s military junta since the coup, and upwards of 24,000 have been arrested, charged or sentenced.\n\nFor JURIST, coverage of the Myanmar coup is personal. Despite the risks, Myanmar law student correspondents \u2013 most of them women \u2013 covered the coup for JURIST from its beginning and have kept reporting in its aftermath. In a bid to keep the crisis in the public dialogue, we have conducted a series of interviews with some of the law students and young lawyers whose lives have been affected by Myanmar\u2019s tumult, ranging from law students who fled abroad to save their futures and continue their studies to those who put down their textbooks and went into the jungle to take up arms against the junta as part of the pro-democracy resistance. Their accounts reflect the full range of emotional responses, from despair to anger to hope.\n\nThe interviews, which will be published in a series of articles, explore the challenges and opportunities facing young people in Myanmar as they navigate a country in political turmoil. This is the sixth interview in a seven-part series, with links to all that have been published so far below. Please note that our interviewees\u2019 names have been kept private to protect their security unless otherwise noted.\n\nInterview 1: \u2018Surviving is sometimes the only way to live in Myanmar\u2019\n\nInterview 2: \u2018I truly believe our lives will be brighter after the revolution\u2019\n\nInterview 3: \u2018The coup has made me both tougher and more compassionate\u2019\n\nInterview 4: \u2018The fact is, I cannot bear to live under oppression\u2019\n\nInterview 5: \u2018We will win. We will restore democracy\u2019\n\nInterview 6: \u2018We must not overlook the ripple effect of coups happening globally\u2019\n\nWould you briefly introduce yourself? What was your life like before the coup?\n\nI was a fourth-year law student in 2020, and for over three years now, I\u2019ve been unable to attend university. I don\u2019t plan to return to a Myanmar university until there\u2019s a significant overhaul of the post-coup educational system. Before the coup, I was an enthusiastic student, eagerly participating in every moot court competition and looking forward to representing clients professionally. These competitions were always so thrilling. Ironically, our post-coup reality is filled with horrifying excitements; I miss the kind of excitement that didn\u2019t carry existential stakes.\n\nWhile I respect the choice of students who have opted or will opt to return to university under the Tatmadaw, I understand it\u2019s their right. However, returning to school under the current regime ultimately hinders the revolution. It\u2019s challenging for me not to hold negative thoughts about this choice, given the broader implications.\n\nWhat are you doing now?\n\nFor the last few years, I\u2019ve been balancing my roles as a paralegal at an international legal aid firm and as an IELTS and GED tutor. It\u2019s been a fulfilling experience, allowing me to stay connected with the legal field, albeit not as a lawyer. I appreciate the organization for welcoming me despite the fact that I have not completed law school. My internship has opened my eyes to a lot of grim truths about how our legal system works in practice. While this sometimes discourages me due to its evident injustice and corruption, there are moments when it motivates me to initiate change. I aspire to uproot existing problems and participate in rebuilding the entire system. While I enjoy both of my current positions, I recognize the importance of finishing school elsewhere to fully pursue my ultimate career goal.\n\nAs a law student, do you think the international community is showing enough support for Myanmar people? What more can they do to help?\n\nInitially, I was quite frustrated by the lack of support we were receiving. In fact, I still believe that more international assistance is crucial to expedite the success of our revolution. I\u2019ve come to understand that the international community has numerous pressing issues to address, making it challenging to focus on the struggles of any one particular nation. But we must not overlook the ripple effect of coups happening globally. It\u2019s imperative for democratic forces to join forces, leveraging their influence to counteract the rise of authoritarianism worldwide, whether through direct action or substantial financial and technical support.\n\nEffectively blacklisting all Myanmar military officials and their family members could prove instrumental. Additionally, offering support to Myanmar\u2019s students and the staff of the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM; ed: post-coup Myanmar\u2019s main resistance movement), enabling them to continue their education, would be invaluable. This investment in human capital would help foster a skilled workforce for future nation-building projects.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on joining the Civil Disobedience Movement as a law student when the military junta is pressuring all university students to go back to classes?\n\nWe have the right to education, but the decision to uphold or forsake this right rests with us alone. Neither the military nor our parents should dictate this choice. It would be utterly meaningless to study law under a regime that flagrantly disregards the rule of law. Unless the military resorts to coercion, we will stand firm and resist with all our might.\n\nWhat do you think about the leadership of the National Unity Government as a parallel government of Myanmar?\n\nWhile I have high expectations, I currently feel they may not be giving their best effort, possibly due to strategic reasons. While the NUG assures our victory in the revolution, we want to see the alliances and strong bonds they\u2019ve forged. The enactment of the Burma Act by the US is commendable, but the NUG needs to establish alliances with other nations, presenting its officials as true leaders rather than mere diplomats.\n\nDo you intend to keep pursuing legal education after the revolution?\n\nLikely yes. Legal education is my passion, but I won\u2019t continue if taught by faculty who are not aligned with the resistance. I intend to pursue my education elsewhere.\n\nDespite the countless difficulties and sacrifices you have to make right now, what makes you keep going?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant to describe what I\u2019m doing as a sacrifice, considering others are risking their lives for federal democracy. I\u2019ve chosen to take some risks, and to me, it\u2019s a choice, not a sacrifice. Though this choice has put me in a challenging situation, I believe in our eventual victory and the triumph of justice.\n\nAny message you\u2019d like to give fellow law students around the world, or the international community?\n\nPlease help us so that we all can live in a better world."
