        "title": "SEC Will Make Major Announcement Today, Ripple Settlement? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed an explosive leak in a tweet yesterday at 10 pm EST, which could affect the entire crypto industry or allegedly Ripple and its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nTerrett wrote that she learned from an anonymous source close to the SEC that the U.S. agency will make a big announcement for the crypto industry tomorrow. The journalist speculates that the announcement could come after 2 pm EST, as the SEC is holding a closed meeting at that time:\n\nMy SEC sources tell me to be prepared for a potentially big announcement tomorrow. Could it have something to do with a Kraken settlement following a closed meeting at 2pm? Could settlement terms have industry ramifications? We\u2019ll see.\n\nTerrett\u2019s tweet has sparked speculation about what the announcement might entail. She herself cites a settlement reached by U.S. exchange Kraken with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was revealed that Kraken is under investigation for alleged violations of U.S. securities laws. Bloomberg reported that the investigation was in an \u201cadvanced stage.\u201d Citing an anonymous source, the report stated that a settlement could be reached \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\nCould It Be A Ripple And SEC Settlement?\n\nMeanwhile, hopes have emerged in the XRP community that Ripple may have reached a settlement with SEC. The rumor stems from the fact that the SEC case against Ripple is fully briefed and now awaiting a decision from judge Analisa Torres, as Bitcoinist reported.\n\nXRP community attorney John E. Deaton has argued in previous tweets that a settlement is unlikely before the court ruling. Deaton believes the regulator is prepared to fight to the end.\n\nHowever, LBRY\u2019s recent partial victory in its case against the SEC may have been a game-changer. The SEC was forced to admit live on tape that secondary market sales do not constitute securities transactions. Still, it remains pure speculation whether the SEC\u2019s announcement will revolve around Ripple\u2019s case.\n\nAnother hot conjecture is an announcement by the SEC on cryptocurrency staking. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted yesterday rumoring that the SEC plans to restrict retail investors from participating in crypto staking. As expected, such an announcement could also have a significant impact on the market.\n\nAt press time, the XRP price stood at $0.3925, down slightly in line with the broader market trend. At the moment, the XRP price is finding crucial support at the 50 and 100-day EMA.\n\nFeatured image from sergeitokmakov / Pixabay, Chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "'It's going to impact our community dramatically': Sidney braces for ripple effect of sugar factory closure - Q2 News",
        "content": "SIDNEY \u2014 It's a big hit to Montana's small towns.\n\nThree hundred people will lose their jobs when Sidney Sugars closes its doors in mid-April, shuttering the factory after nearly 100 years in operation.\n\nAlong with factory workers, farmers, small businesses, schools and more will feel the impact of the closure, as sugar beet production is deeply ingrained in the local economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to impact our community dramatically,\" says Sidney Mayor Rick Norby.\n\nNiehenke Welding started as a blacksmith shop in Sidney in 1921, making it just a little older than the sugar beet factory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re celebrating our 101st year this year,\" says Ross Rosaaen, president of the company.\n\nIn the Rosaaen family for generations, Ross Rosaaen and his father, Stanley, have built their business working with beet farmers.\n\n\u201cOur main priority is our farmers. They have always come first,\" Rosaaen said.\n\nThat's why news of the sugar factory closing is so difficult to bear.\n\n\u201cThe impact of this closure in our area does not just affect Sidney. It affects the outlying communities. It is millions of dollars that is possible loss of revenue for the state of Montana and our county. It\u2019s devastating,\" Rosaaen said.\n\nFrom the welding shop, to other multi-generational family-owned businesses in and around Sidney, such as Western Tire and Tri-County Implement, a lot of the valley's economy is closely tied to sugar beet production.\n\n\u201cIt actually impacts almost every facet of our economy in Sidney and Fairview,\" says Gerrold Baxter, manager of Western Tire. \"The beet growers come in and they spend their money on tires or in the restaurants, and if I get some money for tires I go spend it locally in the restaurants or in the grocery stores or on my kid\u2019s activities. So the trickle-down effect is real when it comes to something like this. Because the money coming in, we\u2019re going to have to get it from somewhere else.\u201d\n\nSidney Sugars, previously Holly Sugars, was purchased by American Crystal Sugar Co. of Moorehead, Minnesota, in 2002.\n\nAmerican Crystal announced the closure of the plant on Monday, saying in a press release: \"The growers of the Montana-Dakota Beet Growers Association showed there is no longer adequate interest in growing sugar beets to sustain operations at Sidney Sugars Incorporated.\"\n\nThat doesn't sit right with the people and the mayor of Sidney.\n\n\u201c[I] was not impressed at all with the letter that was put out to employees. Most definitely not,\" said Norby. \"This is not the farmers\u2019 fault, by any means. When you keep cutting, keep cutting, keep cutting, there\u2019s going to be a point in time where the farmer can\u2019t afford to raise them anymore.\"\n\nRosaaen and Baxter echo the mayor's sentiments.\n\n\u201cAmerican Crystal did the farmers dirty,\" Rosaaen said.\n\nOn top of the loss of a profitable crop is the specialty sugar beet farm equipment all across the valley that no longer has a purpose, making the true economic loss of sugar beets hard to quantify.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s beyond anybody\u2019s belief of how far that ripple will go. Hopefully we (get) through it. That\u2019s all we can do,\" Norby said.\n\nDespite the shadow looming over the community, Sidney has hope for the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a stubborn town. We\u2019re very resilient. We\u2019re a close-knit community,\" Rosaaen said.\n\n\u201cI just believe now it\u2019s time to stick together and help out as much as we can,\" Norby said."

        "title": "NBA Trade Deadline and the ripple effects of the Kevin Durant trade - Detroit Bad Boys",
        "content": "I picked a good time to wake suddenly at 4:30 in the morning. Bleary-eyed, but surprisingly awake, I decided to grab my phone. I wasn\u2019t really expecting to do anything or see any news, but it\u2019s a sick compulsion plenty of us are familiar with.\n\nTo my shock, and that\u2019s putting it mildly, I saw that Kevin Durant and TJ Warren were traded to the Phoenix Suns for a haul that included up to four first-round picks, Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson and Jae Crowder.\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest NBA trade deadline deal since ... I\u2019m not sure, honestly, the coffee hasn\u2019t even kicked in yet. While I still expect an exceedingly quiet deadline for the Detroit Pistons, I do think this deal has nudged the odds ever so slightly more toward the Pistons being willing to part with sharp-shooting forward Bojan Bogdanovic. Put simply, Detroit has a high asking price, and the KD move to Phoenix might entice Western Conference GMs that if they hope to keep pace with the Suns, that is an asking price worth meeting.\n\nIf you\u2019re contemplating some of top names on the speculative trade market, you hear a lot about Bojan, OG Anunoby in Toronto, John Collins in Atlanta, and even Zach LaVine in Chicago. Of that group, I think there\u2019s a good shot all stay put, though I think the best odds probably belong to Collins. Atlanta has had their versatile big man on the market for years with nobody willing to meet its asking price. Today might be the day they finally get their asking price.\n\nSpeaking of the Suns, Collins, and the Pistons, it seemed like as Phoenix was looking to make a splash in the first days of Matt Ishbia\u2019s ownership, there was almost a three-team trade involving Detroit, Phoenix and Atlanta.\n\nAccording to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, who Woj Bomb\u2019ed the story in the early morning hours Thursday, after being rebuffed by the Nets initially, Ishbia moved on to the aforementioned three-team framework.\n\nThe Suns had been talking with Detroit about the possibility of acquiring Collins in a three-way deal with Atlanta, but Ishbia wouldn\u2019t call it a night without making one more run at Durant.\n\nThere had been murmurs that the Suns were previously interested in Collins so if I had to speculate, I imagine the framework would have looked something like this. The Suns receive Collins, the Hawks receive Jae Crowder and Bojan Bogdanovic, and the Pistons receive an expiring like Dario Saric and multiple picks from Phoenix.\n\nAgain, that\u2019s just me speculating. Could the Pistons get a similar haul in this new-look West among potential contenders like the Memphis Grizzlies, New Orleans Pelicans, Denver Nuggets or Los Angeles Lakers/Clippers? We shall see.\n\nIn all likelihood, the Hawks might be stuck where they\u2019ve always been \u2014 trying to move John Collins. The Raptors might be happy building around Scottie Barnes and OG as the young but kinda old vet. They did just trade for Jakob Poeltl, after all. And the Pistons will be just fine finishing at the bottom of the standings this year with a high (hopefully very high) draft pick incoming, a healthy Cade Cunningham, a seasoned Jaen Ivey and Jalen Duren, and vets like Alec Burks and Bogdanovic to serve as valuable role players. While also having $40 million to throw around should the right deal come along.\n\nThe craziest part of the deadline is already behind us, but that doesn\u2019t mean today is destined to be quiet \u2014 even if we get no changes in Detroit. We will know more after the deadline expires at 3 p.m. ET."

        "title": "How Does Big Eyes Coin Stack Up Against Big Boys Like BTC and XRP? - Businessday",
        "content": "Big Eyes Coin (BIG), a relatively new cryptocurrency, is already making waves in the tranquil ocean of the crypto world. The cat-themed meme coin has become the talk of the town as it has raised more than a staggering $24 million until Stage 11 of its pre-launch sales. The euphoria is far from over as the meme coin adds greater numbers to its presale count.\n\nDue to huge interest, experts have already started talking about Big Eyes Coin. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (Ether), Ripple (XRP), etc., still lead the roost, new entrants like Big Eyes Coin are setting the stage on fire and making for a competitive crypto market in the future.\n\nA Combined Look\n\nLet\u2019s see how Big Eyes Coin stacks up against the big players like Bitcoin and Ripple. First, let\u2019s take a quick look at the three cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Bates The Competition\n\nBitcoin needs no introduction when it comes to crypto trading. Bitcoin, the first of its kind, was created in 2009 and is currently the most established cryptocurrency in the world. Since it operates on a decentralized network, it is not controlled or regulated by any government or financial authority.\n\nRipple \u2013 Surfing The Wave\n\nEver since its inception in 2012, Ripple has made a name for itself as one of the best cryptocurrencies. It was launched with the aim to facilitate cross-border payments and improve the efficiency of the global financial system. Unlike Bitcoin, Ripple operates on a centralized network and hence it is controlled and regulated by a central authority.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Announces Extension To Presale\n\nBig Eyes Coin, as mentioned above, is still in its pre-launch phase. It aims to provide a combination of features offered by both Bitcoin and Ripple. Big Eyes Coin operates on a decentralized network like Bitcoin but is more suitable for international payments like Ripple due to many other features.\n\nMarket Capitalization\n\nIn terms of market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ripple are the largest cryptocurrencies, with market caps of over $900 billion and $20 billion, respectively. Big Eyes Coin, on the other hand, has a much smaller market cap of around $500 million, which is still significant, given its recent creation.\n\nTransaction Speed and Cost\n\nTransaction speed and cost are the two leading factors that have made cryptocurrencies an option against the existing financial systems. The traditional financial systems are slow and costly, which created the need for a fast and cost-effective alternative like cryptocurrencies.\n\nTalking about transaction speed and cost, Ripple tops the ladder as it can process thousands of transactions per second. It is also much cheaper than both Big Eyes Coin and Bitcoin when it comes to transaction costs. Ripple has the advantage of operating on a centralized network that gives it the power to process transactions quickly and at a low cost. Big Eyes Coin isn\u2019t far behind as it operates on a hybrid network that allows it to offer faster and cheaper transactions compared to Bitcoin.\n\nLevel of Security and Privacy\n\nSecurity and privacy have always set Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple apart from the rest. Both Big Eyes and Bitcoin operate on decentralized networks, which means they are a lot less vulnerable to cyberbullies.\n\nOn the flip side, Ripple uses a centralized network which makes it more vulnerable to cyberattackers and other related security breaches. Ripple has recently taken some stringent measures to beef up its security and started using encryption and other similar initiatives to improve the security of its network.\n\nAdoption Level\n\nAnother important factor to take into account is the adoption level of each cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is by far the most widely adopted cryptocurrency, with a large and growing number of users accepting it as a form of payment. Ripple is also widely used for cross-border payments, particularly by financial institutions and banks.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, on the other hand, is still in its early stages of adoption, but it has the potential to grow quickly, which is already evident with its impressive presale numbers.\n\nBig Eyes Declares Much Wanted Extension To Presale\n\nBig Eyes Coin is flying off the shelf in a crazy rally that has already surmounted to $24 million and there is no stopping in sight. The presale has entered in its Stage 11 and is still an unbelievable 200% bonus is up for grabs. Use the promotional code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 and take your crypto trading journey to the next level with Big Eyes Coin.\n\nBitcoin and Ripple enjoy the advantage of starting their journeys much earlier than Big Eyes Coin. However, the innovative features and a focus on providing its users with unbeatable security and privacy is likely to take Big Eyes Coin to places. Big Eyes Coin might be a new player but it has what it takes to stack up against the big boys, Bitcoin and Ripple.\n\nFind Out More About Big Eyes Coin:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL"
