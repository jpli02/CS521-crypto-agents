Ripple Labs is such a ruling.\n\nIn what\u2019s been heralded as a landmark victory for the cryptocurrency industry that will shape compliance going forward, a U.S. district judge found that software company Ripple Labs\u2019 XRP token was not a security when sold to secondary market buyers\u2014but it was a security when sold directly to institutional buyers."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is trading mostly in red today, and XRP is no exception.\n\nThe price is down about 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at around $0.60, hinging on a major support level.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP might see increased volatility throughout the next few days. The price is currently trading at 3% in the negative, but that may as well be a result of the broader market shakedown.\n\nAs CryptoPotato reported last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed an interlocutory brief, formalizing its intention to appeal the ruling of Judge Analisa Torres.\n\nJudge Torres ruled that secondary sales of XRP do not constitute an investment contract \u2013 a major point in the SEC\u2019s stance, which undermines its position to a certain extent.\n\nCommenting on the move last week was Ripple\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, who said:\n\nThe SEC does not have the \u201cright\u201d to appeal just yet, which is why they are asking permission to file an \u201cinterlocutory\u201d appeal. Ripple will file its response with the Court next week. Stay tuned.\n\nTo date, the company hasn\u2019t filed its response and it\u2019s interesting to see if it will move the market when it does."

(Photo courtesy Carrie Cheatham) \u00d7 2 of 2 Expand Paintings, such as this one depicting a couple's venue, are an alternative to a traditional guestbook. Prev Next\n\nFrom hand-painted artwork to carefully crafted \u2014 and often punny \u2014 messages, Carrie Cheatham finds delight in each step of the process of card and stationery creation. That joy transfers to the sender, to the recipient and to nonprofit partners that receive a portion of proceeds from her business, Snail Mail.\n\nA nonprofit is actually where Cheatham\u2019s story begins. In 2015, when she was a senior at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, she needed an internship to finish her sociology degree. Someone recommended she work with an organization that supports local migrant communities, which led her to the nonprofit ReEstablish Richmond.\n\nDuring her six-week internship, she helped refugees with transportation and child care. She says the experience taught her more about the cultural intersections that existed in the city. \u201cThey were welcoming me when I was trying to do the same for them,\u201d she says, \u201ceven though they\u2019re thousands of miles from their families, friends and everything they know.\u201d\n\nCheatham wasn\u2019t ready for her connection to end after six weeks, so she began making hand-painted \u201cwelcome home\u201d cards for ReEstablish Richmond and other refugee organizations to give to their clients. In 2017, her husband, Andrew, suggested she sell her cards and donate some of the proceeds to the same nonprofits.\n\nShe showcased her business, Snail Mail, at local markets and on social media, and her cards gained a following through word-of-mouth. That\u2019s when a bride approached her about painting a save-the-date card for her wedding in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\n\u201cShe wanted something that looked hand-done, that fit the scenery of the Grand Teton mountains,\u201d Cheatham says. \u201cIt\u2019s warm, welcoming and cozy, and it feels very intentional.\u201d\n\nExpand Carrie Cheatham creates custom handmade stationery sets for events. (Photo by Kat Jones Creative)\n\nAgain, word spread, and Cheatham received more requests for save-the-date cards, wedding invitations, and bridesmaid and groomsman proposal cards. She also creates keepsake paintings for guests to sign instead of a traditional guestbook. Her designs have featured wedding venues, the colors and flowers in a bridal bouquet or a meaningful scene.\n\nBecause of the handmade nature of her work, she says almost any idea is possible. Her designs range from fully drawn and written by hand to typeset with a hand-painted accent. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to collaborate with a client and see their style and vision,\u201d Cheatham says. \u201cThen I\u2019m the hands that put the ideas on paper. If I can paint it, we can make it happen.\u201d\n\nCheatham has made more than 40,000 cards for all occasions. Her sales continue to support refugee organizations across the commonwealth, including International Neighbors Charlottesville, Sacred Heart Center and Church World Service. Every six months, she chooses a new nonprofit and highlights a specific fund or initiative so that customers understand the impact of their purchase.\n\n\u201cA card doesn\u2019t end with the person that buys it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re ripples of joy and happiness.\u201d"

        "title": "Ripple Vs SEC: US Supreme Court To Interfere If SEC Appeal Judge Torres\u2019 Ruling - CoinGape",
        "content": "Amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) ongoing scrutiny of the cryptocurrency realm, a distinct question has come to light. Could the Supreme Court intervene, potentially obstructing the SEC\u2019s regulatory efforts? The specter of regulatory overreach hovers as the SEC decides to appeal Judge Torres\u2018 ruling in the Ripple vs. SEC case.\n\nRenowned journalist Brooke Masters, in a Financial Times editorial, highlights the potential ramifications of the SEC\u2019s regulatory drive in the cryptocurrency landscape. Masters underscores the pivotal role of the SEC\u2019s decision to appeal the Torres ruling, suggesting it could empower the conservative Supreme Court majority to challenge the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction, spurred by concerns about excessive regulatory measures.\n\nadvertisement\n\nUS Supreme Court To Interfere SEC\n\nThis observation follows a recent incident where the SEC\u2019s aggressive stance on crypto enforcement faced a setback as a federal judge in New York partially rejected it. The enforcement approach has also triggered concerns from some members of Congress who argue that it bypasses the legislature\u2019s authority to formulate securities laws.\n\nAnother side of this debate is also worth mentioning. The \u201cHowey test,\u201d is the reason cited by Torres in the Ripple ruling. The test is a pivotal standard for evaluating investment contracts, which originated from an 80-year-old Supreme Court case involving Florida citrus groves. The Howey test asserts that security involves a promoter\u2019s promise to undertake specific actions to generate profits for investors. This gives more way for the Supreme Court to enter into the matter.\n\nThe editorial highlights the ongoing efforts of US regulatory bodies, like the SEC, in safeguarding investors from potential fraud and volatile market conditions. These efforts have traditionally focused on well-established investment vehicles such as stocks and bonds. However, the explosive rise of cryptocurrencies and other innovative investments has triggered a reevaluation of regulatory boundaries.\n\nPresently, the SEC is actively engaged in multiple battles to enforce its authority in the realm of cryptocurrencies. Simultaneously, a distinct legal case seeks to disrupt over three decades of practice in the leveraged loan market.\n\nAlso Read: BitPay Enables Global Support For XRP, Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments\n\nThe Debate Over Securities\n\nThe legal battles ultimately revolve around the interpretation of the term \u201csecurities.\u201d Originally prompted by speculative investments in the early 20th century, state-level interventions aimed to thwart fraudulent schemes. In response, Congress established the SEC in the 1930s, introducing national standards that govern investment contracts and the entities involved in their distribution.\n\nWhile the primary motive behind these regulatory actions is investor protection, the intricate nature of cryptocurrencies and related assets poses challenges. The extreme volatility of assets like Bitcoin and the collapse of platforms like the FTX crypto exchange have incurred substantial losses for investors. A bankruptcy trustee is also working to recover funds for loan investors affected by a drug testing firm\u2019s bankruptcy amid fraud investigations.\n\nAmid these developments, the editorial emphasizes the desire to include such innovative products within the SEC\u2019s purview to ensure investor safeguarding. However, the editorial warns against potential consequences of regulatory overreach, which could adversely impact the fairness and stability of American markets.\n\nAlso Read: SEI Price Surges 30X; Coinbase Listing, Sei Mainnet Launches"

        "title": "Cross-Border Payment Solutions Give Big Lift to Small Business Growth Plans - PYMNTS.com",
        "content": "Small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) help economies across the world go \u2019round.\n\nBut despite their significant contributions to global commerce, local SMEs have long been underserved by traditional financial institutions when it comes to their own cross-border payments and international expansion goals.\n\n\u201cMost of the companies in the world are actually SMEs,\u201d Pegah Soltani, head of payments products at enterprise crypto solutions provider Ripple, told PYMNTS. \u201cThey ensure competition and drive innovation \u2026 but at the same time, they remain very underserved.\u201d\n\nWhen incumbent financial players look at SMEs, the perceived value of serving these businesses has often been outweighed by the relative costs involved. As a result, small businesses have struggled to compete with larger companies that benefit from established global payment rails and correspondent banking relationships.\n\nBut as Soltani explained, SMEs constitute over $17 trillion of cross-border payments annually, and, spurred by the digital economy providing new go-to-market opportunities, they are growing much faster than other segments.\n\n\u201cSMEs really feel the pain of correspondent banking much more acutely versus larger companies,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have a lot fewer resources. And because they\u2019re smaller, they have worse service and worse pricing relative to the bigger competitors.\u201d\n\nAs the digital economy continues to evolve, small businesses must have access to efficient and cost-effective cross-border payment solutions.\n\nThat\u2019s why Soltani emphasized the ability of cryptocurrency tools to offer an attractive solution to inefficient cross-border payments.\n\nCrypto Removes Legacy Frictions Along the International Expansion Journey\n\nThe most established multinational jumbo conglomerates know that international transacting is inherently complex, no matter your scale.\n\nPart of the reason is that we live in a world without a global banking system, and fragmentation tends to breed inefficiencies and create problem areas within well-trodden processes.\n\n\u201cFrictions range from settlement times to pricing, to transparency,\u201d Soltani said. \u201cBy using blockchain solutions, you not only remove intermediaries but can also reduce delays and provide upfront visibility into fees. There are a lot of operational benefits because the technology is transparent, traceable, auditable, and you have clear records at every stage.\u201d\n\nBut can cross-border crypto payments provide SMEs with the tools they need to thrive in the global marketplace?\n\nSoltani said blockchain-powered payments are among the most promising options to level the playing field.\n\n\u201cBy cutting out the middleman, blockchain-powered solutions increase speed and reduce costs,\u201d she said.\n\nWith Ripple Payments in particular, she added, settlement happens in seconds with \u201cnear-zero\u201d failure rates, enabling SMEs to conduct transactions in seconds rather than days or sometimes weeks.\n\n\u201cWith cross-border crypto solutions, SMEs gain instant settlement, which reduces the need to forecast or park capital over weekends,\u201d Soltani said. \u201cSo, you\u2019re not waiting around for a wire to arrive in three to five days. You don\u2019t need intensive resource requirements or manual overhead, and you\u2019re not paying up to 6% of your margin in costs.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, cross-border crypto solutions offer always-on availability 24/7, 365, regardless of weekend cutoff times or holidays, and their fees are up to 90% less than status quo systems.\n\nTrading Opacity for Transparency While Enhancing Operational Efficiency\n\nUnderlying both efficiency and cost-effectiveness is transparency.\n\n\u201cIn traditional banking or correspondent banking, companies have to forecast how much money they need, when they need it, where they need it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to plan for weekends, holidays, and if they get any of that wrong, it\u2019s costly, and it results in a really bad customer experience for their customer, ultimately translating to lost revenue.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the blockchain technology underlying cross-border crypto payments ensures a transparent, traceable and immutable payment trail for SMEs that is often lacking in traditional payment systems.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s payment world, the standards are really different around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re using SWIFT or TIPS in Europe or [FedNow] in the U.S., you follow a different protocol, and the richness of that data is limited,\u201d she said. \u201cThe result is a bunch of closed networks that don\u2019t really talk to each other, so there\u2019s a lot of manual intervention and ultimately a poor payments experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith ISO 20022, these problems will be solved,\u201d she added. \u201cAt Ripple, we\u2019ve been aligned with ISO 20022 from day one. We\u2019ve always recognized that this is the direction of payments, and it\u2019ll be better for everyone.\u201d\n\nSoltani separately explained that Ripple is committed to the \u201chighest standards in safety, privacy and security,\u201d as evidenced by its SOC 2 certification.\n\nStill, even if expanding internationally can be made easier \u2014 it is never cheap. There are many upfront capital costs that cross-border businesses require. Forty percent of SMEs have unmet financing needs, resulting in a gap of over $5 trillion.\n\nThis financing gap hampers the growth and potential of these businesses, hindering their ability to expand and thrive, and managing these risks and complexities demands expertise and a strong treasury team, which many SMEs lack.\n\n\u201cThe benefits that crypto and blockchain solutions provide ultimately reduce the working capital need for SMEs,\u201d Soltani said. \u201cA lot of times for these companies, the working capital pain points come from a timing mismatch between when you\u2019re receiving money and when you have to pay it out. And for small companies, just a few days makes a huge difference.\u201d\n\nAnd with over 20 million transactions and $30 billion in volume already processed, Ripple is proving that blockchain technology can transform the payment landscape and growth opportunities for SMEs worldwide."
