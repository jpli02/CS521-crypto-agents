        "content": "Venus and Serena Williams altered the landscape of tennis by consistently proving their ability to play with grit, raising the bar, and inspiring the world to attempt to keep up. They entered the Tennis Arena at a period when the sport was experiencing severe difficulties, particularly on the women\u2019s side. However, their perseverance and enthusiasm in fighting for their own spot in the tennis arena truly gave beauty to the sport.\n\nBut leaving everything aside, watching them play is quite different from playing on the same ground with them. Recently, Leander Paes, an Indian tennis player who has watched them play, paid a beautiful tribute and discussed what the legendary sister team contributed to tennis.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to have Venus and Serena Williams?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with The Week, the 50-year-old Indian tennis star discussed secret tales of the life lessons he has gained from the tennis field. And when describing his career as a tennis player, he also paid a beautiful tribute to the Williams sisters. He talked about how the 41-year-old American tennis legend\u2019s story is not just about a simple African American girl making it great in a sport.\n\nBut it\u2019s far more than that, they have inspired millions of girls during their two-decade-long tennis career. He said, \u201cThey were two of my favorite partners. But they redefined the world using tennis as the vehicle. They taught young girls\u2015not just African-American girls\u2015that as a woman, you, too, can be a champion in the world. It\u2019s not just about the men.\u201d\n\nvia Getty MIAMI, FLORIDA \u2013 MAY 07: Venus Williams and Serena Williams laugh on the grid prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 07, 2023 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Dan Istitene \u2013 Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\n\nAlong with that, the 18-time Grand Slam champion also highlighted how, even though he has played with the 23-time Grand Slam champion at Washington Kastles, even their six world championship victories don\u2019t really matter. As they have given more to the sport than just becoming some of the most well-known tennis personalities in the world.\n\nREAD MORE \u2013 43-Year-Old Venus Williams\u2019 Mallorca Visit Culminates in the Legend Training at Rafael Nadal\u2019s Famous Tennis Academy\n\nWell, that\u2019s not it, after battling for pay equity, they were the ones who collected an equal size Champions cheque, bringing a significant shift to the Tennis sector.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWilliams\u2019 sister\u2019s role in bringing about an equal Championship payout\n\nDespite the fact that Billie Jean King initiated the women\u2019s tennis revolution, the Williams sisters were more successful in enacting actual change. The famous sister team has always been forthright about how much equity needed to be changed in the sport.\n\nHowever, after years of voicing their thoughts, the actual shift only occurred in 2007. Like Roger Federer, the eldest Williams sister also received an equal share of the prize money. That was the day that women\u2019s tennis received widespread notice and was valued.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nAnd today, based on how things have developed, the 41-year-old American tennis legend is one of the highest-paid female athletes the world has ever known.\n\nWATCH THIS STORY \u2013Serena Williams pays tribute to Roger Federer"

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAn appeal from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its case against Ripple Labs does not represent a significant blow to Ripple's recent courtroom victory, according to crypto lawyer John Deaton.\n\n\u201cAn appeal is not even close to a setback,\u201d Deaton said, pushing back against a claim made on Twitter. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone underestimate how significant this win is.\u201d\n\nDeaton\u2019s comments came after federal district judge Analisa Torres ruled earlier this month that XRP, the token that powers Ripple\u2019s payments network, is \u201cnot necessarily a security on its face\u201d\u2014except for instances when it was sold to institutions to raise funds.\n\nRipple has been engaged in a legal battle with the SEC since 2020, when the regulator accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion in unregistered securities offerings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d with aspects of the decision, which could have far-reaching implications for other tokens facing regulatory heat. Court documents filed by the federal watchdog on Friday in its case against Terraform Labs suggested an appeal in the Ripple case could come soon.\n\nEven then, it would take a considerable amount of time for the appeal to work its way through the court system, according to Deaton, the founder of Crypto Law.\n\n\u201cIt will be two years from now before a decision is issued by the 2nd Circuit,\u201d Deaton said. \u201cThe Torres Decision is the law until then.\u201d\n\nAn appeal is not even close to be a setback. First, it will be two years from now before a decision is issued by the 2nd Circuit, if it\u2019s appealed. The Torres Decision is the law until then - at least in the 2nd Circuit. Second, even if the 2nd Circuit said Torres was wrong\u2026 https://t.co/GzW31D9edQ \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) July 22, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTorres ruled that programmatic sales of XRP to public buyers fell short of fulfilling the Howey Test\u2014a methodology used to determine whether an investment contract exists in the sale of an asset\u2014because there wasn\u2019t \u201ca reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.\u201d\n\nPublic buyers of XRP didn\u2019t know they were purchasing the token from Ripple due to the structure of programmatic sales, preventing any expectation of profit from being tied to Ripple\u2019s efforts, Torres explained in her decision.\n\n\u201cIt may certainly be the case that many programmatic buyers purchased XRP with an expectation of profit, but they did not derive that expectation from Ripple\u2019s efforts,\u201d Torres said. \u201cNone of the programmatic buyers were aware that they were buying XRP from Ripple.\u201d\n\nEven if the SEC successfully challenges Torres\u2019 application of the Howey Test on this front, Deaton explained, Torres could still rule the same way when looking at the Howey Test\u2019s other factors, such as the \u201cinvestment of money\u201d and the existence of a \u201ccommon enterprise.\u201d\n\nThat would only present a greater challenge for the SEC, Deaton claimed. It\u2019s much harder for the SEC to satisfy that a common enterprise existed under the Howey Test as opposed to an expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others, he said.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who called the Torres ruling \"an unequivocal win for Ripple and for crypto in the U.S.,\" separately picked at the SEC's attempts to be the lead regulator of digital assets.\n\n\"The SEC created this mess by proclaiming it was the cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction,\" he tweeted. \"We all know legislation\u2014not more regulation by enforcement\u2014is the only way forward to provide clear rules and protect retail.\"\n\n\"A securities agency only has jurisdiction over securities\u2014no security, no role for the SEC,\" replied Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty. \"Pretending to have jurisdiction when there is none is simply a political power play. It helps no one; it hurts everyone.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Manipur Video\u2019s Ripple Effect: Meiteis Leaving Mizoram After Insurgents\u2019 Warning - The Indian Tribal",
        "content": "Guwahati/New Delhi\n\nThe viral video of two Kuki-Zomi tribal women being paraded naked and sexually assaulted in Manipur is having a ripple effect in neighbouring Mizoram, wherein a grouping of former insurgents has asked the non-tribal Meitei population in the State to leave for their \u201cown safety\u201d.\n\nFollowing the warning, the Mizoram government has stepped up security for the Meitei community while its Manipur counterpart has announced that it is willing to evacuate them even in chartered flights.\n\nThe caution to the Meiteis, who number around 2,000 in Mizoram, came from an association of former underground insurgents named the Peace Accord MNF Returnees\u2019 Association (PAMRA). It stated that the sentiments of Mizo people were deeply hurt by the violence against the Zo ethnic community in Manipur, and that it is no longer safe for Meitei people to continue living in that State.\n\n\u201cThe PAMRA appeals to all Meitei people in Mizoram to leave for their home state as a safety measure,\u201d it stated. Following this, many members of the Meitei community left the Mizoram capital to either fly out to Manipur or drive down to Assam.\n\nCachar SP Numal Mahatta said many Meiteis reached Silchar from Mizoram on Saturday night and they have been kept at the building of the Lakhipur Development Block in Binnakandi area. \u201cThese are all well-to-do families and they came in their own vehicles. Some are college professors, while some work as senior government officials. They said that there have been no attacks in Mizoram as of now,\u201d he was quoted by a news agency.\n\nIn so far as the police action in the viral video case is concerned, the cops have arrested two more persons including a minor. With the latest arrests, till now, six persons, including one who was seen in the video dragging one of the women at B. Phainom village, have been nabbed. Angry locals have torched the houses of two of the accused.\n\n\u201cAs regards the viral video of two women, two more suspects, including the main accused and a juvenile, were arrested and apprehended today. Altogether, six persons, including five main suspects and a juvenile, apprehended.\u201d the police tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, reports about a zero FIR in another case registered in the same police station where the viral video case has been registered have surfaced. The other case was in connection with abduction, rape and murder of two Kuki-Zomi women, employed in a car wash company. It was registered two days before the viral video case.\n\nEarlier, the house of another suspect in the viral video case was torched by angry locals in the second such incident.\n\nThe house of the key accused, seen in the video prominently directing the mob, was torched on Thursday hours after his arrest. The FIR filed in the case on June 21 details how an armed mob of hundreds had attacked a village in Kangpokpi district and torched, looted houses, killed and committed rapes before abducting the two tribal women.\n\nOn Wednesday, a 26-second video surfaced showing the two women stripped naked, groped by a violent mob and taken towards a paddy field. The incident was of May 4, a day after violence erupted in Manipur.\n\nThe husband of one of the two women is a Kargil war veteran, who had served the Indian Army as a Subedar of the Assam Regiment. He lamented that he protected the country but could not save his wife from being humiliated.\n\n\u201cI fought for the nation in the Kargil war and was also in Sri Lanka as part of the Indian Peace Keeping Force. I protected the nation but am dejected that after my retirement, I could not protect my home, my wife and fellow villagers. I am sad, depressed,\u201d he told a Hindi news channel.\n\nELSEWHERE: A shutdown was observed in tribal dominated regions of Gujarat on Sunday to protest against the Manipur situation. Several market places in Tapi, Valsad, Dahod, Panchmahal, Narmada and Chhota Udepur, which are among 14 districts with sizable tribal population, were deserted. The shutdown was called by various tribal organisations and supported by the opposition Congress, AAP and Bharatiya Tribal Party. Hundreds of people from the Christian community formed a 4-km-long human chain in Ranchi to protest against the incident of women being paraded naked in Manipur. A special prayer was also organised at St Mary\u2019s Cathedral."

        "content": "Mizoram tightens security, asks Meiteis there not to be misguided by rumours\n\nWhy NCW is under fire for its response on Manipur viral video\n\nManipur Horror Latest: CM N Biren Singh says \u2018my main job is to bring peace,\u2019 won't resign\n\nSILCHAR/AIZAWL: Manipuri people, both Meiteis and Pangals (Manipuri Muslims ), have started fleeing Mizoram after an organization of former insurgents of Mizoram, Peace Accord MNF Returnees\u2019 Association ( Pamra ), asked the Meiteis residing there to leave the state for \u201ctheir own safety\u201d on Friday.Later on Saturday evening, Mizoram government\u2019s home department issued a statement saying that Pamra representatives, while expressing regret that their statement on Friday was misconstrued, decided not to pursue it any further to maintain peace and tranquility in the state.Meanwhile, two persons, including a juvenile, were apprehended by Manipur Police on Saturday in connection with the May 4 parading of two women naked in the state.The Mizoram government made an appeal to the Meiteis living in the state not to leave and assuring them of their safety and security amid escalating tension. According to sources at Lengpui Airport, 65 people on Saturday took an Indigo ATR flight from Aizawl to Imphal. Most of them are from central institutes like the College of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry, Regional Institute of Para-medical and Nursing Science, Mizoram University and Zoram Medical College.Security was tightened at several places in Mizoram on Saturday amid fears of a backlash over the May 4 strip-and-parading video even as the government said a former insurgent group's statement on Meiteis had been misconstrued.\u201cThe deployment was made in anticipation of possible development of tension which could threaten the security of Meiteis living in Aizawl due to public outrage against the recent viral video (of two women paraded naked in Manipur ),\u201d DIG (Northern Range) Lallianmawia said.Mizoram home commissioner Pu H Lalengmowia held a meeting with representatives of PAMRA (Peace Accord MNF Returnees\u2019 Association) in his office Saturday where PAMRA clarified that their statement was \u201can advisory requesting Meiteis living in Mizoram to exercise caution in the light of public sentiments regarding the ongoing ethnic conflict in Manipur, and was not a diktat or a quit notice to them,\u201d the state home department said. The PAMRA representatives, it said, had decided not to pursue it any further to maintain peace and tranquillity.Despite assurances and requests from the Mizoram government not to leave the state, 65 people took an Indigo ATR flight from Aizawl to Imphal from Lengpui Airport. Most of them are from central institutions such as the College of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry, Regional Institute of Para-medical and Nursing Science (RIPANS), Mizoram University, and Zoram Medical College.Numerous others are believed to have embarked on their journey by road since Friday evening in their search for safety.The home commissioner also separately met All Mizoram Manipuri Association representatives to assure them of their safety and told them not to be misguided by rumours.The Mizo students at RIMS, Imphal and other institutions are planning to leave Imphal for Aizawl. There are about 200 Mizo students pursuing higher studies in Manipur, all of whom had been evacuated in the wake of the ethnic violence that began on May 3. However, a few, who have essential tasks to complete, returned to Imphal.Most Meteis in Mizoram are from Assam. Sources said Manipuris living in Mizoram have started leaving the state Saturday morning for areas in Assam\u2019s Barak Valley via NH 306, which connects Aizawl with Silchar, following the PAMRA statement.\u201cWe have come to understand that people belonging to both Meiteis and Pangals (Manipuri Muslim), who have been living in Aizawl and other parts of Mizoram, have started leaving the state since around 10am on Saturday out of fear. Many of them already reached Cachar district of Assam. We have urged the Assam government, and the Cachar district administration in particular, to make arrangements for their refuge,\u201d said Nanda Babu Singh, a functionary of Save Manipuri (Manipuri Kanba Lup), an umbrella organisation of 15 Meitei bodies of Assam. He told TOI on Saturday that although they have urged the Assam government to take care of the fleeing members of the Manipuri community of Mizoram, the Meiteis in Barak Valley have come forward to provide accommodation.\u201cMeiteis living in Mizoram are mostly from the Barak Valley and a few are from Manipur. Those from the Barak Valley will go to their homes and those from Manipur will have to stay in Silchar and other areas for some more time because using NH 37, connecting Silchar with Imphal via Jiribam, continues to be unsafe for Meiteis. On the other hand, many cannot afford air travel. Therefore, the Assam government must make arrangements for relief camps for them,\u201d said the Save Manipuri functionary, who retired as a senior Assam administration official.Sources said Meitei organisations have been taking care of those fleeing Mizoram as soon as they reach Cachar.In Manipur, officials said security forces conducted search operations in vulnerable and fringe areas of both the valley and the hill districts, leading to the destruction of nine bunkers and camps on Phaileng hilltop in Kangpokpi district on Friday.\u201cA total of 126 nakas and checkpoints were installed in different districts, both in the hill and the valley, and police detained 413 persons in connection with violations,\u201d the Manipur police tweeted"
