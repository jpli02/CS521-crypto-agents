        "title": "We asked Google Bard what will be XRP price end of 2023; Here's what it said - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been steadily growing in popularity since the emergence of ChatGPT.\n\nAmong the newest additions to this field is Google\u2019s Bard, which is already being utilized to generate forecasts for the price movements of various cryptocurrencies. Against this backdrop, Finbold sought Bard\u2019s expertise to delve into the intricacies of XRP\u2019s future price dynamics, specifically by the end of 2023.\n\nBard\u2019s analysis encompassed a comprehensive analysis of the Ripple v. the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) court case, recognizing the profound implications of both possible outcomes on the token\u2019s valuation. It noted:\n\n\u201cThe SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs is a major overhang on the XRP price. If the lawsuit is resolved in Ripple\u2019s favor, it could lead to a significant increase in demand for XRP.\u201d\n\nThe AI tool also projected that the price of XRP at the end of 2023 is difficult to predict with certainty. However, based on current market conditions and analyst predictions, it is possible that XRP could reach a price of $0.58.\n\nSpecially, the Barn noted that a number of factors could contribute to XRP\u2019s price growth in 2023, including the resolution of the SEC lawsuit, increased adoption by banks and financial institutions, and positive news coverage.\n\nXRP price predictions\n\nIn addition, Bard also provided insights into notable price predictions for the end of 2023 from reputable institutions and platforms.\n\nAmong these forecasts, CoinPriceForecast projected a price of $0.58 for XRP, while Wallet Investor anticipated a slightly lower value of $0.55. On the other hand, Digital Coin Price offered a target of $0.60 while Price Prediction\u2019s suggest $0.70, respectively.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nAs of the current reporting time, XRP exhibits a value of $0.5023, reflecting a notable increase of 4.99% within the day, coupled with a substantial 8.94% rise over the course of the preceding week. This positive momentum has contributed to XRP\u2019s total market capitalization reaching $26.1 billion.\n\nIn terms of price levels, XRP currently has a support level of $0.4685, which indicates a point where buying interest has historically provided a supportive foundation for the cryptocurrency\u2019s value. Conversely, a resistance level at $0.52071 exists, denoting a price threshold that XRP has encountered challenges surpassing in previous instances.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that the XRP network has had its second and third-largest address activity spikes in history over the past several days, indicating that a major bullish rally could be insights for the price of XRP.\n\nFinally, on May 28, John E. Deaton, a prominent legal expert, and commentator on the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple, expressed his astonishment at investors\u2019 apparent disregard for the opportunity to acquire XRP at a relatively low price of $0.48 as he expects FOMO to kick in after the lawsuit is resolved.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Award-winning developers Milhaus, Gershman Partners, and Citimark Inc. have closed on a prime retail and mixed-use multifamily housing development in the heart of Indianapolis\u2019s most popular submarket, Broad Ripple Village.\n\nLocated six miles north of downtown Indianapolis, Broad Ripple Village is in the midst of a $271 million improvement plan, from infrastructure to beautification. The trio of real estate developers have joined hands on Versa, a first-of-its-kind mixed-use development in the heart of Broad Ripple.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether dip; XRP rises; U.S. equity futures gain - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Tuesday morning trading in Asia, giving up a portion of Monday\u2019s gains on what looked like profit taking. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also logged losses. XRP was the exception, rising on speculation the token is underpriced considering potentially positive developments in the lawsuit XRP developer Ripple Labs faces in the U.S. Stock futures in the U.S. moved higher after President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin Mccarthy agreed to raise the government\u2019s debt ceiling over the weekend, averting a default. However, inflation and interest rate hikes might now come back into focus for investors.\n\nBitcoin dips, XRP gains\n\nBitcoin fell 1.45% over the last 24 hours to US$27,792 at 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still trading 2.95% higher for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency peaked at US$28,300 on Monday morning in Asia, the highest price since May 8.\n\n\u201cWith both parties in the US finding agreement to raise the debt ceiling, investors were allowed a dose of optimism,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cOn the short run, though, this might indeed be an opportunity for profit taking, for traders thinking the global economy is still due for more pain and a hard landing,\u201d said d\u2019Anethan.\n\nEther fell 0.96% to US$1,898, while holding a weekly gain of 3.62%.\n\nXRP was the only top 10 non-stablecoin token logging gains for the past 24 hours, rising 2.09% to US$0.4922 and moving up 6.72% for the week. The token received a boost from developments in the lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Ripple Labs, whose blockchain payment protocol uses XRP.\n\nThe court will make public internal documents showing former SEC director William Hinman in 2018 said sales of Ether tokens were not securities transactions, which could undermine the SEC allegation that Ripple Labs sales of XRP were an illegal securities sale, tweeted pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton on Sunday.\n\nDeaton, who said the Hinman documents will move into the public domain even if the SEC and Ripple agree to settle, added that XRP is underpriced and predicted it will attract more buyers and climb to US$1 and beyond.\n\nThe total market cap of cryptocurrencies dropped 1.13% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while the 24-hour market volume dipped 5.54% to US$29.64 billion.\n\nForkast 500 gains; Bitcoin NFT sales fall\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.34% to 3,409.12 in the 24 hours to 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 0.66% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 18.19% in the past 24 hours to US$16.06 million, according to CryptoSlam data. The Solana, Polygon and Cardano networks also saw increased NFT sales in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain, vying with Ethereum for NFT supremacy, saw its 24-hour NFT sales drop 33.64% to US$4.31 million as the hype for $OXBT BRC-20 NFTs faded. The newly launched NFT collection, which accounts for more than a third of sales on the Bitcoin network, posted a 50.97% sales slide in the 24 hours to US$1.52 million.\n\nNakamigos, an Ethereum-based NFT collection, saw the largest sales in the same period across the market, rising 12.27% to US$2.06 million.\n\nElsewhere, Reddit Collectible Avatars, an NFT collection launched by Reddit in July 2022 that act as customizable avatars on the popular social media, had almost 10 million holders as of Tuesday morning, according to data from Dune Analytics, signalling a milestone for Reddit\u2019s Web 3.0 initiatives.\n\nThe growing popularity of Reddit\u2019s NFT project lies in its simplicity, said Web3 technology firm Redeem Co-Founder Toby Rush in an earlier commentary. \u201cImportantly, Reddit\u2019s activation avoided any mention of NFTs. The assets were easy to understand and use, brought real utility to those who held them, and could be purchased with traditional fiat, not crypto.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures gain\n\nU.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 1:50 p.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures moved up 0.11%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.23%, and the Nasdaq futures rose 0.39%.\n\nThe gains came on the back of the debt ceiling deal in Washington, likely removing the risk of a U.S. government default. The bill would suspend the debt limit until January 2025, and will be voted on by Congress on Wednesday.\n\nThe bill included a block on a proposed tax on electricity used by cryptocurrency miners, a positive for the U.S. crypto mining industry.\n\nWith the debt ceiling threat seemingly removed, U.S. investor focus could return to interest rates after the personal consumption expenditures price index released on Friday showed inflation remains a risk, indicating the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on June 14 to decide on rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 40.4% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 59.6% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, down from 63% on Monday, but still a sharp increase from 25.7% on May 22.\n\nBoosted by the rate hike expectation and relieved debt ceiling concerns, treasury futures linked to the U.S. government bond market rallied on Monday, according to Bloomberg, which could add to the pressure on riskier assets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nOther economic data out this week include the U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on Thursday, a measure of the health of manufacturing industries. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 a contraction."
