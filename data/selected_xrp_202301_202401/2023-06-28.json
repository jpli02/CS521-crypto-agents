Many places also plan to discontinue any type of day parties and use of promoters to host events.\n\n\"We have had loitering issues late night, and right now while Broad Ripple Avenue is torn up we want to put safety and love and care for our village first. We all came together and agreed on that one o'clock curfew,\" said Michael Cranfill, a restaurant owner in Broad Ripple.\n\nAccording to the Broad Ripple Village Association, the reasoning behind the change is to help eliminate the string of violence the Village has recently seen.\n\n\u201cThis community-led shift cannot and will not be the only security change made in Broad Ripple Village and these Broad Ripple business owners hope that others will follow their lead to put public safety first,\u201d the Association said in a press release.\n\nThe Broad Ripple Village Association says this is a large financial sacrifice for the businesses included, but \u201ceveryone agreed something had to be done,\u201d and there is \u201cno time to wait for any other entity to act.\u201d\n\nThis announcement comes one day after the association held an emergency meeting to discuss safety plans.\n\nAfter three people were shot and killed in Broad Ripple over the weekend, there has been a rising concern about senseless violence there.\n\nPREVIOUS | 3 killed, 1 injured after Broad Ripple shooting PREVIOUS | Broad Ripple Village Association: Gun restrictions will be for specific area\n\nCranfill attributes the ongoing construction as a reason for the ongoing issues with violent crime.\n\n\"It\u2019s creating blocked off areas in the streets where cars aren\u2019t traveling and that kind of becomes a gathering place for people. These people are under 21. They\u2019re not even allowed in the bars, and they\u2019re just gathering in the streets. At times when first responders, police officers can\u2019t get police cruisers through the streets,\" said Cranfill.\n\nThe group plans to schedule a meeting in the next two-weeks with the mayor\u2019s office, IMPD, DPW and the prosecutor's office to find additional ways to create a safe environment in Broad Ripple Village.\n\n"

        "content": "This artist\u2019s concept shows stars, black holes, and nebula laid over a grid representing the fabric of space-time. Ripples in this fabric are called gravitational waves. The NANOGrav collaboration detected evidence of gravitational waves created by black holes billions of times the mass of the Sun. NANOGrav collaboration; Aurore Simonet\n\nScientists have found evidence of a universal background of gravitational waves, or ripples in the fabric of space-time.\n\nThe motion of black holes and other massive objects through space can create ripples in the fabric of the universe, called gravitational waves. On June 28 scientists announced the first evidence of a background of long-wavelength gravitational waves that fills the cosmos. These waves are thought to have been created over eons by supermassive black holes, up to billions of times the mass of our Sun, circling each other before they merge. Detecting the gravitational wave background is analogous to hearing the hum of a large group of people talking at a party, without distinguishing any particular voice.\n\nThe background ripples detected by NANOGrav could help scientists better understand how gravitational waves are created and what happens to them as they propagate through the universe. They could also be used to study supermassive black hole mergers, events that can last for millions of years. Scientists think these mergers happen in most galaxies and influence their evolution.\n\nThe North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) presented the evidence in a series of papers published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. NANOGrav is a National Science Foundation-funded Physics Frontiers Center of more than 190 scientists from the United States and Canada, including scientists at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and other NASA centers. The collaboration has spent more than 15 years collecting high-precision data from ground-based radio telescopes, looking for these gravitational waves.\n\nThe discovery complements the first-ever detection of gravitational waves in 2015 by LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory. Those signals, at a much shorter wavelength than the new discovery, were from black holes about 30 times the mass of our Sun.\n\nNASA is contributing to the ESA (European Space Agency)-led Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission, a future space-based observatory that will detect gravitational waves that are in a wavelength range between those detected by NANOGrav and LIGO.\n\nTo learn more about the new result, read this news release from Caltech: https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/scientists-find-evidence-for-slow-rolling-sea-of-gravitational-waves\n\nCalla Cofield\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n\n626-808-2469\n\ncalla.e.cofield@jpl.nasa.gov\n\n2023-092"

Many establishments will also stop hosting day-party events in hopes to eliminate the amount of people in the area. Neighborhood leaders plan to meet with law enforcement to discuss additional ways to address the violence.\n\nThe Broad Ripple Village Association requested a permit from the city to make the neighborhood a gun-free zone on Friday and Saturday nights through the end of August. The request comes after three people were shot dead and one was injured early Sunday morning on Broad Ripple Avenue.\n\nA man and woman were pronounced dead at the scene on Broad Ripple Avenue Sunday, according to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. Another man and woman were taken to the hospital in serious condition; that man was later also pronounced deceased.\n\nPolice also arrested a man who fired a gun nearby, but is not believed to have been involved in the shooting. IMPD says there may be unknown individuals who were involved in the shooting who have yet to be apprehended. They pleaded with witnesses to the shooting to share information with the department.\n\nPolice said the investigation is in its early stages.\n\nMayor Joe Hogsett said the city has encouraged civic, neighborhood and private organizations that host high-traffic events to request special event permits that would allow them to declare gun-free zones.\n\nHe said the Broad Ripple Village Association leadership will request such a permit.\n\n\u201cIf this permit is approved, I have pledged my full support that IMPD and other city agencies will provide resources and support to enforce this reasonable request,\u201d Hogsett said.\n\nCity leaders announced the first use of the new \u201cGun Free Zone\u201d designation at the WonderRoad Music Festival in Garfield Park earlier this month.\n\nIMPD Chief Randal Taylor said it was likely the shooting was the result of an interpersonal dispute.\n\n\u201cThe sad thing is it happened in a place where many people, myself, my family, my kids included, have spent a number of hours in Broad Ripple and certainly enjoyed Broad Ripple. Broad Ripple should be enjoyed,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nHe said \u201cemotional immaturity\u201d is driving the gun violence in Indianapolis, and he lamented the passage of permitless carry, which allows adults to carry firearms without having to go through a permitting process.\n\nHogsett said law enforcement and prosecutors have begun to identify \u201cproblem properties\u201d in the Broad Ripple neighborhood. He pledged to hold property owners accountable who do not take basic steps to ensure their properties do not become a magnet for criminal activity.\n\nAnd Hogsett also criticized the state\u2019s permitless carry law.\n\n\u201cHundreds were terrorized in Broad Ripple last night because of the actions of a reckless individual or individuals and their guns, which they may have been perfectly legal in carrying,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when they were empowered by a set of reckless policies that were designed to ensure the simplest solutions are not on the table, tragic evenings like last evening or early this morning happen.\u201d\n\nHogsett said he respects the authority of the state\u2019s General Assembly.\n\n\u201cI just want the legislature to give Indianapolis the opportunity to provide for common sense measures that are applicable to Indianapolis,\u201d he said.\n\nAnyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact Detective James Hurt at the IMPD Homicide Office at 317-327-3475, or via email: James.Hurt@indy.gov\n\n\n\nAlternatively, they can call Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at 317.262.8477 or (TIPS) to remain anonymous.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nContact WFYI education reporter Lee V.

        "title": "Scientists have finally 'heard' the chorus of gravitational waves that ripple through the universe - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Scientists have observed for the first time the faint ripples caused by the motion of black holes that are gently stretching and squeezing everything in the universe.\n\nThey reported Wednesday that they were able to \u201chear\u201d what are called low-frequency gravitational waves \u2014 changes in the fabric of the universe that are created by huge objects moving around and colliding in space.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the first time that we have evidence of just this large-scale motion of everything in the universe,\u201d said Maura McLaughlin, co-director of NANOGrav, the research collaboration that published the results in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nEinstein predicted that when really heavy objects move through spacetime \u2014 the fabric of our universe \u2014 they create ripples that spread through that fabric. Scientists sometimes liken these ripples to the background music of the universe.\n\nIn 2015, scientists used an experiment called LIGO to detect gravitational waves for the first time and showed Einstein was right. But so far, those methods have only been able to catch waves at high frequencies, explained NANOGrav member Chiara Mingarelli, an astrophysicist at Yale University.\n\nThose quick \u201cchirps\u201d come from specific moments when relatively small black holes and dead stars crash into each other, Mingarelli said.\n\nIn the latest research, scientists were searching for waves at much lower frequencies. These slow ripples can take years or even decades to cycle up and down, and probably come from some of the biggest objects in our universe: supermassive black holes billions of times the mass of our sun.\n\nGalaxies across the universe are constantly colliding and merging together. As this happens, scientists believe the enormous black holes at the centers of these galaxies also come together and get locked into a dance before they finally collapse into each other, explained Szabolcs Marka, an astrophysicist at Columbia University who was not involved with the research.\n\nThe black holes send off gravitational waves as they circle around in these pairings, known as binaries.\n\n\u201cSupermassive black hole binaries, slowly and calmly orbiting each other, are the tenors and bass of the cosmic opera,\u201d Marka said.\n\nNo instruments on Earth could capture the ripples from these giants. So \u201cwe had to build a detector that was roughly the size of the galaxy,\u201d said NANOGrav researcher Michael Lam of the SETI Institute.\n\nThe results released this week included 15 years of data from NANOGrav, which has been using telescopes across North America to search for the waves. Other teams of gravitational wave hunters around the world also published studies, including in Europe, India, China and Australia.\n\nThe scientists pointed telescopes at dead stars called pulsars, which send out flashes of radio waves as they spin around in space like lighthouses.\n\nThese bursts are so regular that scientists know exactly when the radio waves are supposed to arrive on our planet \u2014 \u201clike a perfectly regular clock ticking away far out in space,\u201d said NANOGrav member Sarah Vigeland, an astrophysicist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. But as gravitational waves warp the fabric of spacetime, they actually change the distance between Earth and these pulsars, throwing off that steady beat.\n\nBy analyzing tiny changes in the ticking rate across different pulsars \u2014 with some pulses coming slightly early and others coming late \u2014 scientists could tell that gravitational waves were passing through.\n\nThe NANOGrav team monitored 68 pulsars across the sky using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and the Very Large Array in New Mexico. Other teams found similar evidence from dozens of other pulsars, monitored with telescopes across the globe.\n\nSo far, this method hasn\u2019t been able to trace where exactly these low-frequency waves are coming from, said Marc Kamionkowski, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the research.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s revealing the constant hum that is all around us \u2014 like when you\u2019re standing in the middle of a party, \u201cyou\u2019ll hear all of these people talking, but you won\u2019t hear anything in particular,\u201d Kamionkowski said.\n\nThe background noise they found is \u201clouder\u201d than some scientists expected, Mingarelli said. This could mean that there are more, or bigger, black hole mergers happening out in space than we thought \u2014 or point to other sources of gravitational waves that could challenge our understanding of the universe.\n\nResearchers hope that continuing to study this kind of gravitational waves can help us learn more about the biggest objects in our universe. It could open new doors to \u201ccosmic archaeology\u201d that can track the history of black holes and galaxies merging all around us, Marka said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to open up this new window on the universe,\u201d Vigeland said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
