        "title": "XRP Community Believes Ripple CTO is Saying DO not Sell Your XRP: Details - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Members of the XRP community have identified a discreet message advising against selling XRP too early amid a recent disclosure from Ripple CTO David Schwartz.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Schwartz recounted the story of a regrettable investment decision he made several years ago with his Ethereum portfolio. He disclosed that he sold 40,000 Ethereum tokens for $1 each, with the proceeds directed to fund a solar panel project for a property he no longer owns.\n\nMeanwhile, Schwartz acknowledged that the market value of the Ethereum tokens, which he sold for $40,000, later soared to $100 million.\n\nAs many of you know, I sold 40,000 ETH at about $1 to put solar panels on a house I no longer own. That ETH was worth over $100 million shortly after. 1/5 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 8, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAdditionally, he revealed that his father had a parallel experience. He noted his dad liquidated his crypto portfolio and Apple stock, only to witness a substantial increase in their value shortly after.\n\nXRP Army Sees it as \u201cDon\u2019t Sell Your XRP\u201d\n\nInterestingly, XRP community members found a subtle but profound message from the Ripple CTO\u2019s anecdote. They believe he is urging them to remain steadfast in holding onto their XRP, irrespective of the XRP\u2019s price below $1.\n\nFor instance, a pro-XRP X user replied to the tweet, noting that David Schwartz is passing across a message that patience will be rewarded as the value of XRP is anticipated to surge to greater heights soon.\n\nDavid telling the XRP Army to keep the faith , it may be under a $1 now but if you wait that little bit longer you\u2019ll see it go to the moon @JoelKatz https://t.co/2QlnXY54Xj \u2014 HEL XRP ?\u200d\u2620\ufe0f? (@helster80) December 8, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSimilarly, prominent crypto analyst EGRAG replied to Schwartz\u2019s tweet, saying, \u201cNoted, do not sell your XRP.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some community members disagree with the interpretation that Schwartz\u2019s tweet was a coded message about not selling XRP. Pro-XRP X user Guardy claimed Schwartz\u2019s note focused on real estate and not about selling XRP too soon.\n\nNotably, the timing of the Ripple CTO\u2019s disclosure added a twist, favoring the sentiment of those who claimed he was urging against selling XRP too early. Another commenter remarked:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly a warning not to sell. He didn\u2019t need to tweet this right as XRP approaches $1.\u201d"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAfter facing serious backlash from some community members in recent times, XRP has finally printed its first major mega price rally. At the time of writing, XRP soared as high as $0.6988, up by more than 7% in an eclectic 24-hour timespan. Though the growth of XRP aligns with the broader market, the cryptocurrency has managed to define some unique triggers that are boosting its performance at this time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cryptocurrency currently has a trading volume of $2,348,144,202, up 52.35%, underscoring how much momentum it has on spot and futures markets, respectively. With the current outlook, XRP is making a somewhat daring move that might historically be important for traders following its growth trend.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoRank, a sustained bullish momentum might push XRP to its first positive December since 2019. XRP has historically closed the month on a negative note, printing just four positive closes in 10 years.\n\nXRP dropped by 2.28% in December 2018, by 16.8% in December 2019 and by 66.5% in December 2020. The two subsequent years 2021 and 2022 also saw XRP slump by 17% and 16.9%, respectively.\n\nTime for XRP to make a switch\n\nWith the historical odds against it, chances are the ongoing run will be pivotal in helping it make a change this time around. Since the start of the month, XRP has soared as high as 14.4%, per the CryptoRank data, and a potentially flat growth rate would have helped it make history.\n\nIn all, a potential close at $0.8 is likely, retesting its best price level for the year.\n\nSome bottlenecks, however, are on the horizon for XRP in connection to the outstanding settlement between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With Ripple deemed guilty of selling XRP to institutional investors, the precedent set might change the likelihood of massive embrace by these classes of investors in the future.\n\nNonetheless, XRP is maintaining its status as a utility currency, and this can serve as the right basis for its deep embrace in the future."

        "title": "Ripple (XRP) in 2023: The Most Important Developments This Year - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nRipple scored three significant partial legal wins against the SEC in 2023, including a favorable ruling on XRP sales and the clearing of top executives from charges, with a major trial set for April 2024.\n\nRipple gained recognition with prestigious awards, including a spot in People\u2019s Magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Companies Who Care\u201d and Fortune Magazine\u2019s top workplaces in technology, along with winning the UK\u2019s PAY360 Award.\n\nThe price of Ripple\u2019s XRP token increased by 77% in 2023, influenced by these successes. Future price movements could be impacted by the 2024 Bitcoin halving and the outcome of the ongoing Ripple-SEC lawsuit.\n\nRipple\u2019s Winning Streak Against the SEC\n\n2023 has been a highly successful year (at least so far) for Ripple. Some might argue that its main achievements are connected to the legal battle against its big enemy \u2013 the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe company won three vital, yet partial, victories, with the first occurring in mid-July. Back then, US Federal Judge Analisa Torres determined that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales from years ago did not constitute an offer of investment contracts.\n\nThe second win happened at the beginning of October when the magistrates dismissed the SEC\u2019s intention to appeal the initial court decision. Shortly after, Ripple\u2019s CEO \u2013 Brad Garlinghouse \u2013 and Executive Chairman \u2013 Chris Larsen \u2013 were cleared of all charges brought by the regulator.\n\nAnd while the SEC appears to be the underdog in the legal battle, the war is far from over. Both entities are scheduled to meet each other at a grand trial next spring. Moreover, Judge Torres set a schedule for remedies-related discovery and briefing. Ripple and the SEC are required to complete the necessary procedures before February 12, 2024.\n\nRipple\u2019s Awards in 2023\n\nBesides its success on the court field, the blockchain enterprise has made the headlines by winning some prestigious awards. Ripple gained acknowledgment from People\u2019s Magazine, finding a spot among the \u201c100 Companies Who Care For Employees And Society.\u201d\n\nSeveral months later, Fortune Magazine placed the crypto firm in the 13th position (out of 50) as \u201cthe best workplace in technology\u201d for 2023.\n\nLast but not least, Ripple won the most prestigious payment prize in the United Kingdom (UK) \u2013 the PAY360 Award. It topped the ranking for being the leader in digital currencies/assets in financial services.\n\nXRP Price Rally\n\nSomewhat expected, the price performance of XRP (the native token of Ripple) has coincided with the company\u2019s achievements throughout the ongoing year.\n\nThe coin was worth $0.35 at the start of 2023, whereas currently, it hovers around $0.62 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), representing a 77% surge.\n\nThe increase was even more substantial in July when XRP exploded above $0.80 shortly after Ripple secured its first partial court win against the SEC. Numerous analysts have recently predicted that the token might explode in the near future, with some envisioning outrageous targets. For example, Shannon Thorp claimed XRP could skyrocket to a whopping $500.\n\nSuch a valuation would most likely remain a mirage, considering the fact that the asset\u2019s market cap needs to shoot above $250 trillion for this to happen. Recall that the entire market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry was around $3 trillion during the bull run in 2021 when Bitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time high of almost $70K.\n\nThose willing to find out how XRP might perform in the remaining weeks of 2023 could take a look at our dedicated video below:\n\nCould 2024 be Ripple\u2019s (XRP) Year?\n\nThe current bullish condition of the cryptocurrency sector and the upcoming developments next year might trigger a further price surge for XRP.\n\nOne element that could play a role is the Bitcoin halving (scheduled for the spring of 2024). The event might contribute to a potential BTC bull run, with history showing that the asset\u2019s uptrend could stimulate a rally among the altcoins.\n\nAnother factor worth observing is the outcome of the lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC. The grand trial between the two entities is set for April 2024. A decisive Ripple victory would be cheered by the crypto community and possibly propel an XRP price increase. On the other hand, the implications for the asset might not be so favorable if the SEC emerges victorious."

        "content": "Palau is touting its pilot of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) based on Ripple technology. Despite minor challenges, the feedback from the pilot conducted on Ripple\u2019s CBDC platform has been positive.\n\nA successful CBDC pilot\n\nDuring the program\u2019s first phase, the Ministry of Finance reported high satisfaction in Palau\u2019s Ripple-based Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot. Around 31.7% of survey participants expressed satisfaction with the experience, while 36.6% deemed it excellent.\n\nThe pilot program imposed various restrictions, involving only 168 volunteers from June to September 2023, and permitted up to $20,000 worth of digital currency to enter circulation.\n\nVolunteers were restricted from acquiring additional digital currency, non-selected users were unable to obtain the stablecoin, and only participating local retailers had the privilege to redeem the stablecoin for U.S. dollars. Palau\u2019s Ministry of Finance issued the corresponding tokens on the XRP Ledger and secured those funds by collateralizing them with U.S. dollar deposits held in a U.S. FDIC bank.\n\nThe Palau Finance Ministry and Ripple Labs have shared the pilot\u2019s results, outlining the subsequent steps in the project\u2019s roadmap. This initiative sets the stage for potential national adoption of the stablecoin as a payment solution, marking a pioneering effort in the use of stablecoins for small island nations.\n\nOn Dec. 7, Palau\u2019s Ministry of Finance unveiled an extensive report detailing the initial phase of its innovative Ripple-based stablecoin program. Collaborating with Ripple\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and Central Bank Engagements teams, the country employed Ripple\u2019s CBDC platform at a technical level for the pilot project.\n\nLaunched in June 2023 and concluded in Sept. 2023, the program facilitated up to 200 employee volunteers from Palau\u2019s executive branch to engage in transactions with local retailers, although the data indicates that only 168 individuals took part.\n\nWhile 58% of respondents found the setup and usage of the wallet for payments easy or very easy, issues emerged during payment transactions. Half of the participants reported encountering slowness in wallet use or payment processing, along with difficulties related to QR code usage and manual address input.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Ministry of Finance labeled the first phase of the program a \u201csuccess among both volunteers and retailers.\u201d Emphasizing the need for future phases to concentrate on building a larger ecosystem using stablecoin and establishing a legal framework, the ministry expressed its intention to introduce the stablecoin nationally as a convenient and cost-effective payment method in the long term.\n\nYou might also like: Ripple VP James Wallis bullish on CBDCs, unlike Mastercard\n\nThe Palau (PSC) stablecoin\n\nNumerous nations are investigating and embracing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to enhance payment systems, foster financial inclusion, and boost economic efficiency.\n\nLast December, the Republic of Palau entered into a partnership with Ripple to introduce a U.S. Dollar-backed stablecoin on the XRP Ledger.\n\nThe Palau Stablecoin (PSC) was inaugurated as part of a Phase One pilot program, involving voluntary participation from government employees.\n\nThe PSC is securely backed by the U.S. Dollar and operates on the environmentally friendly XRP Ledger.\n\nIn its pilot program, government employees were able to convert the received stablecoin into funds deposited in their local bank accounts. Following the success of Phase One, subsequent phases of the Palau stablecoin pilot program are in the pipeline, aiming to extend the adoption and benefits of PSC to a broader audience.\n\nAustralia, China, and India are also actively testing both wholesale and retail applications for their Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to enhance payment systems, promote financial inclusion, and increase economic efficiency.\n\nIn India, two CBDC pilots, one for wholesale (CBDC-W) and another for retail (CBDC-R), have been launched.\n\nDespite encountering early challenges, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) aims to nationally launch its CBDC by the end of 2023.\n\nThe success of CBDC implementation in these countries has inspired over 100 others to explore CBDCs, each driven by diverse motivations, such as fostering financial inclusion, introducing competition in domestic payments, and enhancing cross-border transactions."

        "content": "KORCZOWA, Poland (AP) \u2014 Pickup trucks and tourniquets bound for Ukraine\u2019s battlefield are among items stuck in a mileslong line at the border with Poland. Components to build drones to fight off Russian forces are facing weeks of delays.\n\nUkrainian charities and companies supplying the war-torn country\u2019s military warn that problems are growing as Polish truck drivers show no sign of ending a border blockade that has stretched past a month. The Polish protesters argue that their livelihoods are at stake after the European Union relaxed some transport rules and Ukrainian truckers undercut their business.\n\nWhile drones will make it to the front line, they\u2019re delayed by two to three weeks, said Oleksandr Zadorozhnyi, operational director of the KOLO foundation, which helps the Ukrainian army with battlefield tech, including drones and communications equipment.\n\nREAD MORE: How Ukraine soldiers use inexpensive commercial drones on the battlefield\n\n\u201cThis means that the Russian army will have the ability to kill Ukrainian soldiers and terrorize civilians for several weeks longer,\u201d he said.\n\nTruck drivers in Poland have blocked access roads to border crossings since Nov. 6, creating lines that stretch for more than 30 kilometers (19 miles) and last up to three weeks in freezing temperatures. The protesters insist that they\u2019re not stopping military transports or humanitarian aid into Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis is very puzzling to me, even hard to believe because everybody knows \u2014 those who order, those who expedite and those who do the transport \u2014 that aid for the military passes through without having to wait at all,\u201d said Waldemar Jaszczur, a protest organizer.\n\nThe Polish truckers, meanwhile, say their Ukrainian counterparts are offering lower prices to haul everything from fish to luxury goods across the European Union since getting a temporary waiver on the 27-nation bloc\u2019s transport rules after Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022.\n\nDespite Poland and other nearby countries being some of Ukraine\u2019s biggest supporters in the war, resentment has built from truckers and farmers who are losing business to lower-cost Ukrainian goods and services flowing into the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc. It underscores the challenges of integrating Ukraine into the EU if approved.\n\nNow, the commercial clash is spilling over to the battlefield, the Ukrainian charities say.\n\nAbout 200 pickup trucks needed to transport ammunition and evacuate the wounded from the front line are blocked at the border because \u201cdeliveries have practically stopped,\u201d said Ivan Poberzhniak, head of procurement and logistics for Come Back Alive, Ukraine\u2019s largest charitable organization providing the military with equipment.\n\nThe pickup trucks are easy targets for Russia, so it\u2019s impossible to deliver enough of them even normally, he said.\n\nWhen drivers show documents to the Polish truckers saying the vehicles are for Ukraine\u2019s military, \u201cit does not have a significant impact on the protesters,\u201d Poberzhniak said.\n\n\u201cWe must understand that during wartime, supply is needed on a daily basis in all directions,\u201d he said.\n\nCome Back Alive says 3,000 tourniquets also are stuck at the border. It\u2019s been able to deliver drones, generators and batteries from what it has in stock, \u201cbut that reserve is running out,\u201d Poberzhniak said.\n\nThe group is exploring alternative supply routes, he says, but there are few options, and the military\u2019s unfulfilled requests for equipment are building up.\n\nThe protesting truckers assert that not all deliveries declared as military aid are really that. They are urging the EU to reinstate the limits on the number of Ukrainian trucks that can enter the bloc.\n\nJaszczur, the organizer, said Ukrainian truckers have been doing unauthorized transport services across Europe. They are asking \u201cglaringly low prices\u201d \u2014 35 percent lower than what Polish truckers charge \u2014 and are \u201cdriving us out of the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same thing is happening in other countries like Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania, he said. Some Slovak truckers staged a protest of their own in recent days at the Ukrainian border.\n\nJaszczur says many Polish transport companies are going under because of the pressure from Ukrainian competition.\n\nWhile there is no quick resolution in sight, a change of leadership in Warsaw offers hope.\n\nThe new government is expected to be in place in the next week and almost certainly will be led by the pro-EU centrist Donald Tusk. He has criticized the outgoing government\u2019s \u201cinaction,\u201d offering hope to businesses hurt by the blockade but also to the protesters.\n\n\u201cWe will look for solutions that should satisfy Polish transporters, but we will not tolerate any events that threaten Polish security. Who inspired or initiated them?\u201d Tusk said Friday, stressing that Ukraine is a strategic point for Poland as it fights Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nREAD MORE: EU official von der Leyen visits Kyiv to discuss Ukraine\u2019s path to join the European Union\n\nUkrainian truck driver Ivan Itchenko is one of those eagerly awaiting a resolution. He has been waiting in Poland for days with hundreds of others, trying to stay warm at a highway rest stop until he can bring his load of salmon and herring to Ukrainian supermarkets.\n\n\u201cI clean the truck, clear the snow. Polish customs officers come and ask for documents three times a day,\u201d Itchenko said Thursday.\n\nThe 61-year-old hoped his turn to drive through the Korczowa-Krakovets crossing would come Saturday.\n\n\u201cI live in Chernihiv (region), near Russia. Every day there are attacks. Now I am stuck at the Polish border. What do they want?\u201d\n\nWith temperatures falling, drivers are experiencing difficult conditions, choosing not to heat their trucks to save fuel and facing limited access to food and bathrooms, Ukrainian media say.\n\nPolish and Ukrainian officials are negotiating with help from the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, but the protest has only expanded.\n\n\u201cWe do not see any light in the tunnel, we do not see any authorities, any government or the EU Commission really giving attention to this,\u201d said Dariusz Matulewicz, head of the truckers\u2019 association in Szczecin, a city in western Poland.\n\nPoland\u2019s outgoing government has \u201cnothing against supporting Ukraine\u201d but it \u201cmust not allow the aid activity to be done at the expense of Polish firms,\u201d deputy minister for infrastructure, Rafal Weber, said Monday in Brussels.\n\nThe EU has pressed Warsaw to find a way to end the blockade but stood by its deal with Kyiv. It\u2019s \u201cbeneficial to the European market, to Ukraine and to Moldova,\u201d said Adina Valean, EU transport commissioner who also threatened sanctions against Poland.\n\nUkrainian officials say the truckers\u2019 protest adds more stress to their economy and only serves Russia\u2019s interests.\n\nUkrainian exports have dropped by 40 percent through the four blocked border crossings, and the state budget has lost some 9.3 billion hryvnias ($254 million) due to the shortfall in customs payments, said Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the finance and tax committee in Ukraine\u2019s parliament.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, this is a powerful blow to our economy and our exports,\u201d Hetmantsev said Tuesday on state TV.\n\nAP journalists Vanessa Gera in Warsaw and Volodymyr Yurchuk in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed."
