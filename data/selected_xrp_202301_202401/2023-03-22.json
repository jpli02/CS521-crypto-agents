        "content": "The western half of Broad Ripple Ave will soon close for construction.\n\nThe Indianapolis Department of Public Works will start the second phase of Broad Ripple Avenue construction next month.\n\nThe multi-year project invests more than $8.6 million in the overhaul of Broad Ripple Avenue from the Monon Trail to College Avenue. DPW Director Brandon Herget said much of the work centers on sewer and drainage improvements.\n\n\u201cThis construction project will lay new stormwater infrastructure under the avenue to alleviate historic flooding,\u201d Herget said.\n\nStreet rehabilitation, lighting and sidewalk widening are also key parts of the DPW project. The first phase closed the avenue from Guilford Avenue to Winthrop Avenue. That work was completed earlier than expected last year.\n\nA section of the roadway from Guilford Avenue to College Avenue is set to close April 3. That closure will last until August, more than double the time some businesses hoped for.\n\nThose establishments will remain open during the street closure, and DPW said businesses will be accessible to pedestrians.\n\nBroad Ripple Village Association Executive Director Jordan Dillon said the construction work is vital, but the longer timeframe is an unexpected challenge.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that this project is expected to take nearly 60% longer than what we were originally told and in the lack of planning for emergency services,\u201d Dillon said.\n\nDillon said construction along the busy stretch presents safety concerns for patrons that haven\u2019t been addressed.\n\n\u201cRight now in the current plan, our fencing goes right up to the sidewalk and on the other side of the sidewalk there\u2019s a wall,\u201d Dillon said.\n\nDillon added that businesses in the popular bar and entertainment district are already struggling, and the longer closure will have an economic impact.\n\nThe project comes after months of public engagement about the process. Herget said the start date was delayed after community input.\n\n\u201cJust out of respect \u2013 that so many businesses depend on March Madness and St. Patrick's Day and events like that,\u201d Herget said.\n\nDPW said update meetings will be held and businesses will have direct contact with managers in case of any problems.\n\nThe completion of all construction is expected in August."

        "title": "American Military Veterans Bear Cost of Wars and It\u2019s Growing - The War Horse",
        "content": "Drop a pebble into a pond and, after the initial splash, ripples spread across the water. It\u2019s a familiar image, one we know so intuitively that everyone understands immediately what you mean by the phrase \u201cripple effect.\u201d Yet, even when the pebble is a boulder, and the splash soaks us, we may not fully grasp how far the ripples will spread\u2014or for how long.\n\nOn March 20, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq. I crossed the berm two days later as part of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), 26 years old and full of equal parts naivete and cynicism. The war already seemed unjustified to me, but I felt deep loyalty to my fellow troops, and some measure of excitement at what was to come. If the waiting place is, as Dr. Seuss says, the worst place to be, I\u2019d rather have been at war than sitting around Camp Udairi.\n\nDuring my deployment, I went on combat foot patrols with the infantry in Baghdad, got bored out of my mind on Mount Sinjar, endured chronic sexual harassment, and came home feeling like America was a foreign land after a year in the Middle East. In Iraq, I also met the man who became my husband.\n\nIn retrospect, my book about his injury and our relationship was an effort to tell myself that the ripples had stopped spreading. We coped with his traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, learned to navigate the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs, and advocated for improvements to systems and services. I wanted a nice tidy narrative arc. I wanted a happy ending\u2014or at least a hopeful beginning for the rest of our lives. I wanted to box up the war and put it away. We had two children and a bright future. Let the pebble sink as the waters stilled.\n\nBut sometimes the ripple becomes a wave that threatens to sink the whole boat. PTSD, I learned, can be chronic and episodic. Brian had good weeks, months, years\u2014but they were never permanent. He drank, sometimes heavily, when times were bad. Eventually, I reached a breaking point. I decided the status quo could not endure.\n\nOn Aug. 24, 2018, I took the metro back from work. Walking home from the station, I saw emergency vehicles in front of my house. Heart pounding, I walked inside. Brian sat in a chair by the door, where a paramedic assessed him. My husband was shirtless, covered in sweat, and confused. When I asked where our children were, he replied, \u201cChildren?\u201d\n\nI sprinted through the house. Our two children were nowhere to be found. I returned to him and asked, louder, \u201cWhere are our kids?!\u201d He looked baffled. From the door, a tiny, nervous voice, our neighbor: \u201cI have your kids.\u201d\n\nAward-Winning Journalism in Your Inbox Subscribe to Award-Winning Journalism* Email address\n\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nWhen I stepped outside, she explained that my daughter had run up to her crying, saying her daddy fell down and couldn\u2019t talk. I got all the information I could, staying composed and focused, and asked if the kids could stay at her place while we sorted this out. My neighbor was sobbing as I reassured her repeatedly that she did the right thing, that she was doing a great job.\n\n\u201cHow are you so calm?\u201d she asked me. What else could I do? I wondered to myself. Was there any other choice? Out loud, almost automatically, I told her, \u201cIt\u2019s from being in the military.\u201d\n\nMy assumption was that Brian had had an anxiety attack, hyperventilated, and passed out. With PTSD, panic attacks were, for him, not uncommon. But the paramedic was concerned about how high his pulse and blood pressure were, as well as his ongoing confusion, so he was transported to the ER by ambulance, while I followed in my car.\n\nAfter a couple of hours of waiting to be seen in the emergency room, Brian mentioned a pain in his shoulder. Given how long it took for the ache to begin, I guessed it was just bruised from his fall. Still, he asked the doctor for an X-ray. After what seemed like a further interminable wait, we learned he had had a seizure and had broken his collarbone when he fell.\n\nThere is a part of me that wants to distance myself from all of this by reverting to the safety of clinical terms. I want to revise these paragraphs and tell you I came home that day and my husband was diaphoretic and postictal. These words\u2014dense, precise, diagnostic\u2014come easier than remembering the specifics of my daughter retelling the story of daddy screaming and falling down in front of her for weeks as she worked through her own trauma. I want to write, of my husband, \u201cHe had been struggling for years with comorbid PTSD, major depressive disorder, substance use disorder, and TBI,\u201d rather than ever admit the terror I felt during specific incidents, the embarrassment when the police came, the shame of pretending everything was fine when it definitively was not.\n\nIn the warped way that life sometimes unfolds, the horror of this incident ended up saving our marriage. Perhaps the ripples, now waves, had ricocheted off a rock\u2014rather than swamping our tiny boat, they had pushed it away from the rapids. After the civilian ER doctor put Brian on an anticonvulsant known to cause suicidality, his Defense Department neurologist prescribed him a different anticonvulsant that was also a mood stabilizer. Things changed dramatically. What had been wild and frightening swings from sadness to rage settled into normal currents of emotion. When the doctor told him alcohol \u201creduced his seizure threshold,\u201d Brian quit drinking. Sobriety became its own salve.\n\nTime passed, the ripples spread. Even after 15 years. It had not occurred to me, when I walked into our house in 2018, that Brian could have had a seizure, because it had been 15 years since shrapnel gouged a trough in his brain just below the skull. After it happened, in 2003, providers had warned us about the risk of seizures post-TBI. But it had been 15 years without one.\n\nFor years, I had tried to convince myself that the ripples had been contained\u2014that they had not spread beyond his parents, me, the Defense Department, and VA. Then, suddenly, our county had to send paramedics into our home. Our neighbors had to help run errands, since the state (rightly) banned Brian from driving for six months, until a doctor could affirm that his seizures were controlled by medication and it was safe for him to drive again. Our school system needed to provide counselors for our children. My employer had to give me extra time off work to drive him to medical appointments.\n\nThere are now more than 1.9 million U.S. veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. More than 50,000 of us were physically injured. Around 15% have experienced PTSD. And perhaps all of us were exposed to burn pits and other toxins, as were an untold number of Iraqis. The long-term impacts of the war on frontline civilians and third-country nationals have barely been considered. I am just telling you our story, my husband\u2019s and mine. Ours is but a tiny ripple, from a single pebble, in an ocean.\n\nMy generation has benefited tremendously from Vietnam veterans, who fought like hell to get PTSD recognized. Because of their tenacity, we finally have a language to describe, and evidence-informed treatments to manage, the psychological effects of the trauma of war. And like Iraq veterans, Vietnam veterans also struggled for decades to get recognition of the impacts Agent Orange had on their health, of its risks to their children. After we started coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, they swore, \u201cNever again,\u201d and fought alongside us for a swifter and better response to our own toxic exposures.\n\nThis advocacy recently led to passage of the PACT Act, which adds a dozen different cancers and another dozen illnesses to the list of health conditions VA assumes (or \u201cpresumes\u201d) to be caused by exposure to toxic substances for all who deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and other qualifying locations after 9/11 or during the first Gulf War\u2014as well as adding new conditions to the list of illnesses assumed to be linked to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam veterans. VA has already screened more than a million veterans under the new program, hiring 2,000 new disability claims processors and additional health care providers to manage the influx of new patients and claims.\n\nAs a veteran and a caregiver, I am profoundly grateful to all who advocated for this expansion\u2014even while, as a taxpayer, I blanch a bit at the projected price tag of $152 billion over the next 10 years for disability compensation alone. And I know the PACT act may still not capture all conditions. Cancers often take decades to develop. The potential epigenetic effects of our exposure, passed on to our children and grandchildren, may take generations to identify.\n\nThe ripples may yet become waves: PTSD has been linked to heart disease; TBIs are associated with dementia; caregivers are at increased risk of hypertension, reduced sleep, and mental health problems.\n\nAnd the ripples from this 20-year-old war will long outlive me, spreading for many decades to come. In 2020, Irene Triplett died, age 90, the last surviving dependent of a Civil War veteran receiving a pension, 155 years after that conflict ended. Life expectancy has only increased since the Civil War ended in 1865, or since she was born, in 1930. Brown University\u2019s Costs of War project estimates $2.2 trillion in federal obligations for post-9/11 veterans\u2019 care over the next 30 years alone\u2014this number does not include costs that cities, counties, and states bear as well.\n\nOur Journalism Depends on Your Support Hidden Our journalism depends on your support.\n\nWhen we project the costs of war into the future, we must imagine these collective costs, these ripples, that will continue spreading for at least another 155 years. It is daunting to imagine that somewhere among the cohort of Iraq War veterans is likely a man who will father a child well into his old age, who will live for many years, and that there could be another, similar headline to that about Triplett\u2019s passing, in the year 2166 or beyond.\n\nAs the anniversary of the Iraq War approached, and of the day I crossed the berm two days later, I have not been looking back to the start of the war, but forward\u2014to where the ripples are likely to go. What I\u2019ve come to realize is this: They\u2019ve only just begun to spread.\n\nThis War Horse reflection was edited by Kelly Kennedy, fact-checked by Jess Rohan, and copy-edited by Mitchell Hansen-Dewar.
