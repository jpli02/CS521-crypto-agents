        "title": "The emerging new world economy - Asia Times",
        "content": "The emerging new always both frightens and inspires the fading old. History is evidence of that unity of opposites. Sharp-edged rejections of what is new clash with enthusiastic celebrations of it.\n\nThe old gets pushed away even as bitter denials of that reality surge. The emerging new world economy displays just such contradictions.\n\nFour major developments can illustrate them and underscore their interactions.\n\nShift to economic nationalism\n\nFirst, the neoliberal globalizing paradigm is now the old. Economic nationalism is the new.\n\nIt is another reversal of their previous positions. Driven by its celebrated profit motive, capitalism in its old centers (Western Europe, North America and Japan) invested increasingly elsewhere: where labor power was far cheaper; markets were growing faster; ecological constraints were weak or absent; and governments better facilitated rapid accumulation of capital.\n\nThose investments brought big profits back into capitalism\u2019s old centers, whose stock markets boomed and thus their income and wealth inequalities widened (since the richest own the great bulk of securities).\n\nEven faster was the economic growth unleashed after the 1960s in what quickly became capitalism\u2019s new centers (China, India and Brazil). That growth was further enhanced by the arrival of the capital relocated from the old centers.\n\nCapitalism\u2019s dynamic had earlier moved its production center from England to the European continent, then on to North America and Japan. That same profit-driven dynamic took it to mainland Asia and beyond during the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries.\n\nNeoliberal globalization in theory and practice both reflected and justified this relocation of capitalism. It celebrated the profits and growth brought to both private and state-owned/operated enterprises around the world.\n\nIt played down or ignored the other sides of globalization: (1) growing income and wealth inequalities inside most countries; (2) the shift of production from old to new centers of capitalism; and (3) faster growth of output and markets in new centers than old centers.\n\nThese changes shook the old centers\u2019 societies. Middle classes there atrophied and shrank as good jobs moved increasingly to capitalism\u2019s new centers.\n\nThe old centers\u2019 employer classes used their power and wealth to maintain their social positions. Indeed, they got richer by harvesting the greater profits rolling in from the new centers.\n\nHowever, neoliberal globalization proved disastrous for most employees in capitalism\u2019s old centers. In the latter, the employer class not only grabbed rising profits, but also offloaded the costs of the decline of capitalism\u2019s old centers on to employees.\n\nTax cuts for business and the wealthy, stagnant or declining real wages (abetted by immigration), \u201causterity\u201d reductions of public services, and neglect of infrastructure produced widening inequality.\n\nWorking classes across the capitalist West were shocked out of the delusion that neoliberal globalization was the best policy for them too. Rising labor militancy across the US, like mass uprisings in France and Greece and leftist political shifts across the Global South, entail rejections of neoliberal globalization and its political and ideological leaders.\n\nBeyond that, capitalism itself is being shaken, questioned, and challenged. In new ways, projects for going beyond capitalism are again on the historical agenda despite the status quo\u2019s efforts to pretend otherwise.\n\nExpanding state power\n\nSecond, over recent decades, the intensifying problems of neoliberal globalization forced capitalism to make adjustments. As neoliberal globalization lost mass support in capitalism\u2019s old centers, governments took on powers and made more economic interventions to sustain the capitalist system.\n\nIn short, economic nationalism rose to replace neoliberalism. Instead of the old laissez-faire ideology and policies, nationalist capitalism rationalized the state\u2019s expanding power.\n\nIn capitalism\u2019s new centers, enhanced state power produced economic development that markedly outgrew the old centers. The new centers\u2019 recipe was to create a system in which a large sector of private enterprises (owned and operated by private individuals) co-existed with a large sector of state enterprises owned by the state and operated by its officials.\n\nInstead of a mostly private capitalist system (like that of the US or UK) or a mostly state capitalist system (like that of the USSR), places like China and India produced hybrids. Strong national governments presided over coexisting large private and state sectors to maximize economic growth.\n\nBoth private and state enterprises and their co-existence deserve the label \u201ccapitalist.\u201d That is because both organize around the relationship of employers and employees. In both private and state enterprises/systems, a small employer minority dominates and controls a large employee majority.\n\nAfter all, slavery also often displayed co-existing private and state enterprises that shared the defining master-slave relationship. Likewise, feudalism had private and state enterprises with the same lord-serf relationship.\n\nCapitalism does not disappear when it displays co-existing private and state enterprises organized around the same employer-employee relationship. Thus we do not conflate state capitalism with socialism.\n\nIn the latter, a different, non-capitalist economic system displaces the employer-employee organization of workplaces in favor of a democratic workplace community organization as in worker cooperatives. The transition to socialism in that sense is also a possible outcome of the turmoil today surrounding the formation of a new world economy.\n\nThe state-private hybrid in China achieves remarkably high and enduring GDP and real-wage growth rates that have continued now over the last 30 years. That success deeply influences economic nationalisms everywhere to move toward that hybrid as a model.\n\nEven in the US, competition with China becomes the go-to excuse for massive governmental interventions. Tariff wars \u2013 which raised domestic taxes \u2013 could be enthusiastically endorsed by politicians who otherwise preached laissez-faire ideology.\n\nThe same applied to government-run trade wars, government targeting of specific corporations for punishment or bans, government subsidies to whole industries as so many anti-China economic ploys.\n\nImperial decline\n\nThird, over recent decades, the US empire peaked and began its decline. It thus follows every other empire\u2019s (Greek, Roman, Persian and British) classic pattern of birth, evolution, decline, and death.\n\nThe US empire emerged from and replaced the British Empire over the last century and especially after World War II. Earlier, in 1776 and again in 1812, the British Empire tried and failed militarily to prevent or stop an independent US capitalism from developing.\n\nAfter those failures, Britain took a different path in its relations with the US. After many more wars in its colonies and with competing colonialisms across the 19th and 20th centuries, Britain\u2019s empire is now gone.\n\nThe question is whether the US has learned or even can learn the key lesson of Britain\u2019s imperial decline. Or will it keep trying military means, ever more desperately and dangerously, to hold on to a global hegemonic position that relentlessly declines?\n\nAfter all, the US wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq were all lost. China has now replaced the US as the major peacemaker in the Middle East. The days of the US dollar as the supreme global currency are numbered. US supremacy in high-tech industries must already be shared with China\u2019s high-tech industries.\n\nEven major US corporate CEOs such as Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and the US Chamber of Commerce want the profits of more trade and investment flows between the US and China. They look with dismay at the Joe Biden administration\u2019s rising politically driven hostilities directed at China.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nFourth, the US empire\u2019s decline raises the question of what comes next as the decline deepens.\n\nIs China the emerging new hegemon? Will it inherit the empire mantle from the US like the US took it from Britain? Or will some multinational new world order emerge and shape a new world economy?\n\nThe most interesting possibility, and perhaps the likeliest, is that China and the entire BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) grouping of nations will undertake the construction and maintenance of a new world economy.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has already enhanced the prospects of such an outcome by strengthening the BRICS alliance. Many other countries have applied or will soon apply for entry to the BRICS framework.\n\nTogether, they have the population, resources, productive capacity, connections, and accumulated solidarity to be a new pole for world economic development. Were they to play that role, the remaining parts of the world from Australia and New Zealand to Africa, Europe and South America would have to rethink their foreign economic and political policies.\n\nTheir economic futures depend in part on how they navigate the contest between old and new world economic organizations. Those futures likewise depend on how critics and victims of both neoliberal/globalizing capitalism and nationalist capitalism interact inside all nations.\n\nThis article was produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute, which provided it to Asia Times."

        "title": "DaVinci Resolve 18.5 Announced - Newsshooter",
        "content": "Blackmagic Design has announced DaVinci Resolve 18.5 at NAB 2023 in Las Vegas. This is a big update that introduces new AI based tools, new Resolve FX, text-based editing, speech-to-text and audio classification, new Cut page menus, and Fusion USD support for faster workflows.\n\nKey features Multiple Cut page improvements.\n\nSupport for Blackmagic Cloud Presentations.\n\nDaVinci Neural Engine based subtitles from audio in Studio.\n\nDaVinci Neural Engine powered text based editing in Studio.\n\nNew Resolve FX relight tool for adding virtual light sources\n\nSupport for Universal Scene Description based workflows in Fusion.\n\nNew Fusion multi-merge tool to composite and manage multiple layers.\n\nMultiple remote monitoring improvements.\n\nSupport for fast per timeline backups.\n\nPer timeline Resolve Color Management.\n\nSupport for edit and mix groups in Fairlight.\n\nSupport for AI based audio classification in Studio.\n\n.\n\nDaVinci Resolve 18.5 introduces dozens of new tools including 4 new AI tools, over 150 feature upgrades, and major updates to the Cut page. Editors can now transcribe audio within clips to search for media based on narrative content, or quickly generate subtitles for timelines with the automatic speech to text feature. DaVinci Neural Engine AI can analyze and automatically sort audio clips based on classification, and on the Fairlight page audio tracks can now be grouped for faster mix automation and editing. Colorists can use the new Relight FX to add virtual lighting to a scene. VFX artists can collaborate more easily with support for USD files and work faster with the multi-merge tool.\n\nUsers can now initiate remote monitoring using just a Blackmagic ID and a session code. They just have to enable remote monitoring in DaVinci Resolve and share their code, so there is no need to deal with IP addresses and port forwarding. You can also stream to multiple computers, iPads or even iPhones all at the same time. Users can also now export their timeline to the Blackmagic Cloud using the new Presentations feature which is in public beta for customers with project libraries. With Presentations, multiple people can review their timeline, leave comments and even share a live chat. Comments will appear as markers on their DaVinci Resolve timeline, allowing customers to act on feedback quickly.\n\nOn the color page, DaVinci Resolve color management can now be configured on a timeline level. Any existing custom timelines are automatically initialized to color management settings from the project. This allows the setting of independent timeline and output color spaces per timeline for projects with mixed media. The new Relight FX lets customers add virtual light sources into a scene to creatively adjust environmental lighting, fill dark shadows or change the mood. Light sources can be directional to cast a broad light, a point source, or a spotlight and be adjusted for surface softness and specularity control. The Color page viewer now supports marker overlays and annotations for timeline and clip markers.\n\nThe addition of three new menus to the Cut page timeline allows for quicker and more flexible editing. Use the timeline options, timeline actions and edit actions to toggle ripple editing, trim edit points to the playhead, resync audio, and change the appearance of the timeline and more. Scene cut detection is also now possible directly on the Cut timeline. Simply navigate to the timeline menu and click \u2018detect scene cuts\u2019. Selected clips will be analyzed for content and cut points automatically placed on every new edit in the rendered clip. Customers can modify or remove trim points as needed.\n\nThe Cut page has a new ripple button that enables and disables rippled edits. Previously edits were always rippled, now by disabling the ripple button the duration of the edit will be preserved so customers can create gaps in the timeline. Customers can hold the option key to disable ripple for that edit only. Split A/V allows the edit point for video or audio to be adjusted separately. Simply drag the lower part of a clip to separately adjust the audio track, allowing the dialogue to be heard before or continue after the video clip is seen. Editors can now creatively focus visual attention on the scene using audio to add interest, drama and even tension to dialogue scenes on the Cut page.\n\nThe auto subtitle feature on the Cut and Edit pages transcribes speech to text automatically into a subtitle track on the timeline. To activate, simply click \u2018create subtitles from audio\u2019 in the timeline menu. Once analyzed, click the individual captions to modify them in the inspector.\n\nSpeech to text editing has also been added in the \u2018transcribe\u2019 feature which automatically transcribes video and audio clips. Customers can search for specific terms or jump to the section of a clip where a word appears. Instead of listening to entire scenes or interviews, customers can quickly locate the topic they need and add it to their timeline saving countless hours.\n\nContent creators can now upload videos directly to TikTok by simply signing in to their TikTok account in preferences, and using either the render preset in the Deliver page or the quick export dialog. A new option for vertical aspect ratio output makes creating content for social media even easier.\n\nSupport for the OpenTimelineIO (OTIO) format makes importing and exporting timelines from other NLE applications faster and easier. OTIO supports metadata for clips, timing, tracks, transitions and markers, as well as information about the order and length of cuts and references to external media. Plus customers can also now quickly backup and restore their work by enabling per timeline backups in preferences. Modified timelines will be backed up locally for both collaborative and non collaborative projects on local, network and Blackmagic Cloud project libraries for greater security on multi user projects.\n\nFusion now supports Universal Scene Descriptor files for easier collaboration between VFX artists. USD data such as geometry, lighting, cameras, materials and animation can be imported. Fusion\u2019s new USD tools let customers manipulate, re-light and render files using Hydra-based renderers such as Storm. The new multi-merge tool lets customers merge numerous media sources into a single multi layer stack, so it\u2019s easier to create composites by merging clips, stills or graphics using layers. Each layer has its own controls, so customers can still change individual properties like position, size and apply modes. The native AI based Depth Map tool is now also supported in Fusion Studio.\n\nAudio engineers are now able to combine related audio tracks or mixer channels into groups, enabling shared mix automation or editing operations. When creating groups, customers can determine the parameters they will share. Groups can be nested, or temporarily suspended to quickly switch focus to smaller groups or individual tracks. The DaVinci Neural Engine can now classify audio clips based on their content, making editing choices faster when reviewing unfamiliar materials. After analysis, audio clips appear in bins categorized for dialogue, music and effects with detailed subcategories such as explosions, water, or insects.\n\nWhen using elastic wave processing to retime audio clips, the new \u2018voice\u2019 option offers natural-sounding, high-quality results when changing the speed of dialogue or singing, even when using more extreme keyframing.\n\nAvailability\n\nDaVinci Resolve 18.5 public beta is available now for download from the Blackmagic Design website."

        "title": "XRP: The Start Of A Long Term Bull Run - Investing Haven",
        "content": "These are interesting times for XRP holders. We signaled, exactly one month ago, that XRP has the most beautiful long term crypto chart (at the depth of the banking crisis, when XRP was trading at 0.38). Even though there is still risk from the SEC/Ripple case there is also a phenomenal XRP chart. Because charts don\u2019t lie we will give the market the benefit of the doubt. The market knows more, much more. There must be a reason why XRP qualifies as the most beautiful long term crypto chart right now.\n\nBefore we look at the long term XRP chart, let\u2019s replay our findings and writings in the last 2 months:\n\nOn Feb 5th, 2023: XRP: An Epic Buy The Dip Opportunity Might Be Underway (when XRP was trading at 0.4):\n\nFrom a chart perspective, XRP continues to work on a long term triangle. Visibly, a W-pattern is in the making inside this triangle. Both are bullish chart characteristics, certainly when combined. We believe a buy opportunity is in the making in XRP. The next volatility window, mid-Feb to mid-March, should come with a \u2018buy the dip opportunity\u2019 provided that XRP respects the 0.34 level.\n\nOn March 25th, 2023: XRP\u2019s Explosive Chart Setup Is Ready To Erupt (when XRP was trading at 0.44):\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be clearer: an epic support structure is being created \u2018as we speak\u2019. Equally important, is how XRP is now flirting with the 2 year falling trendline. In fact, XRP is breaking out right now.\n\nOn March 29th, 2023: An Epic Breakout in XRP: Bullish Triangle Finally Resolved\n\nIn conclusion, XRP\u2019s breakout from the bullish triangle is a very powerful chart event. It looks like XRP is ready to test 0.66. Whenever it breaks through 0.66, either short term or medium term, the higher levels between between 1.23 and 1.66 will become realistic and easy to achieve price targets.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the up to date charts now, starting with the longest timeframe: the weekly since inception.\n\nThe giant W reversal that started back in 2018 is absolutely powerful. With the recent breakout of the 2-year falling trendline it is clear that the 4th and last leg of the W-structure is now well underway. This means that the bull run will start slowly, initially, until the acceleration point is reached. That\u2019s when an aggressive move will start. That\u2019s not now, also not next week, maybe in a few weeks or a few months.\n\nThe daily timeframe of the same long term channel shows the breakout. It is now confirmed because XRP has registered more than 13 days above the 2-year falling trendline.\n\nA few points that we mentioned in the past in recent writings:\n\nQ: What to think about the fact XRP has essentially \u2018done nothing\u2019 in the last 5 years, other than bouncing in a wide range, while many other tokens trade 10x above their pre-Covid levels and pre-2017 levels?\n\nA: It\u2019s very simple: the longer an orderly consolidation, the higher the upside potential. It\u2019s a very easy dynamic, however extremely difficult to understand and apply. We believe that 99% of investors don\u2019t understand it and are not able to apply it as a portfolio principle.\n\nQ: How to mitigate the SEC lawsuit risk against Ripple?\n\nA: Very simple, there is an easy way around it. An entry and exit strategy to mitigate the SEC/Ripple risk while leveraging the opportunity that is present on the chart.\n\nHow exactly? That\u2019s what we explained in our March 19th alert called \u2018Is XRP about to stage a secular breakout\u2018, available in our crypto research area. You will have instant access after signing up.\n\nReceive our crypto FREE newsletter alerts Download 50 crypto investing tips"
