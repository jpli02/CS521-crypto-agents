        "content": "The collaboration between Ripple Labs Inc. and the Central Bank of Bhutan to create a Digital Ngultrum will enter the pilot phase in 2024.\n\nThe plan for this next phase was detailed in a Policy Brief detailing the key agenda to transform the Bhutanese economy into a vibrant and self-sustaining one.\n\nWith the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or Digital Ngultrum a key part of its plans, the apex bank is optimistic the alternative currency can truly make a difference to the average Bhutanese.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBhutan CBDC: Key Timeline to Watch\n\nThe Bhutan CBDC project started as early as 2021, with Ripple Labs playing a frontline role. So much has been achieved since the project was commissioned, with three distinct phases completed from 2021 to date.\n\nRipple and the Bhutan Central Bank have carried out a needs assessment to highlight how a Digital Ngultrum will benefit the masses. After completing this needs assessment phase, the project went on to carry out the CBDC design and scoping, after which it then carried out the \u201ctechnical design and proof of concept.\u201d\n\nWith Ripple playing a frontline role every step of the way, the project is now slated for Pilot implementation starting next year. This next phase is bound to progress until 2026, according to the schedule of events in the Policy paper.\n\nThe goals for this pilot phase and the entire Bhutanese CBDC push are summarized in determining how a Digital Ngultrum is deployed and integrated into existing financial infrastructures in the country.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHaving developed the technology to facilitate both retail and wholesale CBDCs, Ripple Labs\u2019 solutions will enable the transition of these systems and further bolster the drive toward financial inclusion.\n\nCBDC Race Might Heat Up Soon\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), at least 100 countries are actively researching or developing CBDC in one form or another.\n\nWhile different countries have unique reasons for developing their own digital money, the need to quickly update their financial infrastructures and not lag may heat the push for CBDCs in the coming year.\n\nWhile countries are still deciding whether or not to launch CBDCs, players like Ripple Labs and Mastercard are already a step ahead in researching innovative ways to power the interconnection between these CBDCs for cross-border payments when they eventually go live."

        "content": "The Florida Office of the Attorney General is suing a St. Lucie County pool company, alleging dozens of Floridians were tricked into paying for pools that were never built. The owner was previously arrested October 19 and accused of only completing three pools in a 14-month span.\n\nPart of , the Port St. Lucie Police Department (PSLPD) accused the pool company owner, 59-year-old George Galiszewski Jr., of defrauding 104 victims of over $2.5 million, opposed to the 40 complaints and more than $1.5 million schemed an AG news release said. Named in the suit along with Pro Pool Builders, LLC and its owner are three alleged employees.\n\n\n\nThey are Karen Teresa Edgington, Warren Robert Sigman Jr. and Tiffany Moore who all participated in the pool building operation.\n\nSee also:\n\nThe lawsuit filed by AG Ashley Moody is seeking damages in an amount greater than $50,000. The filing also claims the pool company operated under Sigman's contractor license and was registered as an active company with the state from September 2020 to September 2022.\n\n\u201cThey finally just quit showing up in April of 2022,\" a victim previously told CBS12 News. \"The contract states that the pool be completed within 12 weeks of permitting. Twelve weeks of when our permit was actually pulled, we had a hole in the ground, and that was it.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile failing to complete numerous construction projects, Galiszewski and Pro Pool Builders also failed to pay subcontractors and suppliers, the news release said. After shutting down, the company allegedly stopped responding to customers, leaving them with the burden of the costs and causing some to have liens placed on their residences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough pill to swallow knowing that I made a bad investment of $44,000 to have a hole dug,\" another victim previously told CBS12 News. \"It\u2019s just sickening, gut wrenching.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe civil action is seeking penalties on each defendant for each violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act that left victims feeling ripped off.\n\n\"Pro Pool Builders took large payments from consumers and promised to complete pool construction within 90 days from the date of permit issuance,\" Moody said. \"However, instead of performing the work, consumers report that they either didn\u2019t start projects or left incomplete pools in consumers\u2019 yards, then abruptly closed business.\"\n\n\n\nIn addition to the civil lawsuit, Galiszewski is facing six charges in a St. Lucie County criminal case.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a con man. He was in it for money, and he didn\u2019t care about the victims,\u201d PSLPD Assistant Chief Leo Niemczyk previously said.\n\n\n\nThe assistant chief claimed in an October press conference that Galiszewski showed no remorse, using the illegally obtained funds for a vacation in Costa Rica and expensive restaurants along the Treasure Coast.\n\nHe remains in jail charged with misapplication of construction funds, first-degree grand theft, money laundering, racketeering, aggravated white collar crime and failure to obtain workers' compensation coverage, jail records show.\n\nHis total bond amount remains at just over $2.5 million \u2014 the same amount he scammed from the victims, officials said.\n\nIn the press conference from about two months ago, officials said the PSLPD oversaw 64 victims, Martin County Sheriff's Office had 29, St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office had six, Indian River County Sheriff's Office had four and the Stuart Police Department had one."

        "content": "Jane MacMaster regularly posts about Australian engineering achievements and challenges on social media, often sparking lively conversations.\n\nThe Chief Engineer for Engineers Australia tells Cosmos, there\u2019s one subject that ignites the passions of her network, generating \u201can order of magnitude\u201d more likes and comments than other posts.\n\nAnd that\u2019s maths.\n\nStrong quantitative, analytical thinking and problem solving skills are what makes an engineering qualification so highly valued across the economy, MacMaster says. Skills underpinned by an understanding of maths.\n\n\u201cWe need more young Australians to study maths at higher levels and higher standards, in order to be the pipeline of our future engineering workforce,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s why Engineers Australia is prioritising maths education action plan for tackling the nation\u2019s \u201cgreatest ever engineering skills shortage\u201d.\n\nSeveral issues are now troubling the profession.\n\nJane MacMaster. Credit: Engineers Australia 2021\n\nFirstly, the number of year 12 students choosing to study intermediate or higher level maths is now at an all-time low, according to the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute. Two-thirds (66%) of final year students are enrolled in one or more maths subjects, compared to typical levels hovering around 71 \u2013 73% in the past decade.\n\nA contributing factor, MacMaster says, is that in many Australian states and territories no longer make studying maths compulsory through to year 12.\n\nAdding to the mix is the surprisingly large share of engineering courses which do not require maths as a prerequisite.\n\n38% of engineering courses in Australia do not require any level of maths as a prerequisite for entry\n\nMacMaster is concerned that the declining numbers of senior students studying maths, particularly at intermediate or higher levels, means a cohort less likely to start, and successfully complete an engineering degree.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem because Australia is already second lowest in the OECD in the share of university graduates who are engineers, according to Professionals Australia, another organisation concerned about the looming skills crisis.\n\nThe shortage of engineers isn\u2019t unique to Australia, it\u2019s a problem facing other countries including the United Statesand United Kingdom.\n\nBut at 8.5% the share of students graduating as engineers in Australia is well below the OECD average (13%) and much lower than countries like Germany (23%) and Korea (21%) which top the list.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nStrong grounding in maths has long been considered essential to engineering education.\n\nSo it\u2019s surprising to learn that 38% of engineering courses in Australia do not require any level of maths as a prerequisite for entry.\n\nA 2020 report by the Office of the Chief Scientist and the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute mapped university maths and science prerequisites for a range of disciplines considered to have a strong link to mathematics, including engineering.\n\nThe decline in prerequisite requirements has consequences for both universities and students, the report says. Universities need to support students enrolling with varied skill levels, including some below the expected levels; meanwhile students entering a maths-heavy degree like engineering may feel underprepared or struggle with the content.\n\nAssociate Professor Gavin Buskes is an education specialist in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology at the University of Melbourne. Under the \u2018Melbourne Model\u2019 entry into a Bachelor of Science majoring in engineering systems requires Mathematical Methods VCE Units 3 and 4 (an intermediate level of maths in years 11 and 12) as a minimum.\n\nStudying mathematics gives you analytical skills, or problem solving skills, that you can use as an engineer Associate Professor Gavin Buskes, University of Melbourne\n\nBuskes says there are a \u201chuge range of reasons\u201d why an understanding of maths is fundamental for studying engineering.\n\nFirst and foremost, he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a very good correlation between students who do mathematics at high school and their interest in engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecondly, studying mathematics gives you analytical skills, or problem solving skills, that you can use as an engineer\u201d. He describes maths as a \u201cplayground\u201d for exercising those skills without having to bring in discipline-specific knowledge.\n\nThirdly, studying engineering involves a lot of team-based and project-based learning, and that becomes much more challenging when there isn\u2019t a shared level of maths knowledge across the group.\n\n\u201cMathematics helps engineers understand how things work\u201d, says Professor Braden Phillips, Deputy Dean Learning and Teaching in the Sciences, Technology and Engineering faculty at the University of Adelaide.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding maths offers insights that drive creativity. This is a vital point. Some believe there is a clear divide between creative practice and mathematical analysis, but for engineers that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he says.\n\nPhillips says engineers use maths to describe, model and evaluate systems, designing solutions to achieve performance goals, maximise safety and minimise environmental impacts.\n\nUnderstanding maths offers insights that drive creativity Professor Braden Phillips, University of Adelaide\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s systems are often so complex, or based on phenomena that are that so far from everyday lived experience, you can\u2019t design by intuition or common sense alone.\u201d\n\nStudents struggle without strong foundations\n\nMacMaster supports the need for inclusive and alternative pathways into professions like engineering. But she says \u201csooner or later, you can\u2019t avoid the fact that courses like engineering require a certain sophistication of maths ability\u201d.\n\nMacMaster says being accepted into engineering without those skills does a disservice to young people who suddenly get slammed with mathematical concepts they haven\u2019t been exposed to across a variety of engineering subjects.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re encountering maths at a level they just haven\u2019t been exposed to before. And it\u2019s a huge challenge for them, and many drop out because of that,\u201d she says.\n\nBuskes says while supports are available, lecturers find when students are struggling in the later years of the degree \u2013 say with a subject like control systems which relies on a lot of complex mathematics \u2013 it can often be hard to work out whether it\u2019s the underlying mathematics that they\u2019re having problems with, or the discipline concepts.\n\nSooner or later, you can\u2019t avoid the fact that courses like engineering require a certain sophistication of maths ability Jane MacMaster, Engineers Australia\n\nResearch by Professionals Australia shows only a quarter of students complete their Bachelor of Engineering within the minimum time frame, and approximately 40% of those who start an engineering degree, don\u2019t complete it.\n\nAll of which is a problem because according to Engineers Australia, the country needs an additional 50,000 to 100,000 engineers are needed by 2030 to meet the needs of the clean energy transition, major infrastructure projects, space, and emerging areas like artificial intelligence, robots and AUKUS.\n\nMacMaster sees a direct link between improving maths education and meeting those national priorities.\n\n\u201cWe need more young Australians to study maths at higher levels and higher standards, in order to be the pipeline of our future engineering workforce,\u201d she says.\n\nInterested in maths?
