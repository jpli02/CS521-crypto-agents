        "content": "The disruption of Ukrainian agriculture caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is creating a shortage of commodities in African countries, like Kenya, that heavily rely on imported grain and products like fertilizer and irrigation equipment.\n\nTo help meet the challenge, the U.S. government is working with Kenyan agricultural sector companies to strengthen the industry. Development agency USAID says it is critically important to invest in agriculture to reduce shocks that arise from external events.\n\nDavid Gosney, the agency's mission director in Kenya, said: \"There will be more work, they will be able to capitalize new technologies in terms of seed and other productivity means and we already talked about solar agriculture irrigation and others which basically are critical factors which we are highlighting here.''\n\nKenyan fertilizer producers like David Auerback told VOA that his firm, Sanergy, would double organic fertilizer production. He was awarded $1.2 million to produce fertilizer for Kenyan farmers this year.\n\n''Being able to produce locally is very valuable,\" he said. \"Our organic fertilizer is increasing farmers' crop yield by 30%. We are working with about 10,000 farmers and 1,000 agrovets in just about every county in Kenya and this support from USAID helps us accelerate our production so that we can reach all these farmers even faster.''\n\nThe United States announced grants worth around $5.1 million to agricultural sector companies Monday at an American Chamber of Commerce summit in Nairobi.\n\nMoses Kuria, Kenya's minister for trade and investment, told the forum that the two nations' principles have been key to such collaborations.\n\n''It is a joint initiative because we are negotiating on the basis of shared values, the values we share on diversity, the value we share on climate change sustainability, the value we share on digital trade,'' he said.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has been on a weeklong visit to Africa. She has said America will increase investment in Africa and help spur economic growth in the region. Harris is the fifth top U.S. official to visit the continent this year."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to News.Yahoo, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, Twitter boss Elon Musk and Apple co-creator Steve Wozniak have signed an open letter urging AI research companies to pause the development of advanced artificial intelligence for half a year.\n\nLarsen, Musk, Wozniak against advanced AI\n\nOverall, more than 1,100 people have left their signatures on this letter, which requests that within the next half year, no AI that can outpace the current language processor GPT-4 should be trained. Currently, this model of AI is powering ChatGPT, made by OpenAI, as well as the Bing and Bard systems.\n\nElon Musk recently made several public statements against the further development of AI and against ChatGPT in particular, calling the latter \"woke.\" This happened because ChatGPT is programmed to produce texts that will not offend users in any way.\n\nThe above-mentioned product is produced by OpenAI, the company whose foundation Musk contributed to financially in 2015. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit project, but later on, the management made a U-turn in this regard, and Musk left the company. This was the case when OpenAI accepted large investments from Microsoft.\n\n300 million jobs can be taken away by AI\n\nNow, Musk is allegedly seeking to create a company that will rival OpenAI and ChatGPT. Musk, Larsen, Wozniak and the other signatories of the open letter believe that advanced AI may deprive around 300,000,000 people of jobs in the future, according to a report by the Financial Times. According to the report, around two-thirds of jobs in the U.S. and Europe may be automatized. In 63% percent of those, less than half of tasks can be performed by algorithms.\n\nToday, as if to highlight the problem of the potentially dangerous AI development for the human job market, Musk posted a joke in which agnostic scientists launched artificial intelligence to find out if there is a god, and AI told them that from now on there is."

        "title": "The XPG Fusion Titanium 1600 PSU Review: Outrageous Power, Outstanding Quality - AnandTech",
        "content": "Power Supply Quality, Software & Conclusion\n\nPower Supply Quality\n\nThe electrical performance of the XPG Fusion Titanium 1600 PSU is nothing short of stellar. The filtering is amazing, with the ripple hardly reaching 20 mV while the unit outputs 1600 Watts \u2013 a mere sixth of the recommended design limit, regardless of the monstrous power output. Regulation is outstanding, at 0.5% on the primary 12V line and 0.9% on the secondary 3.3V/5V lines. By default, the average output voltage for all lines is a little high but there is a reason for that, as we will see in the software section of our review.\n\nMain Output Load (Watts) 326.4 W 815.27 W 1217.99 W 1621.29 W Load (Percent) 20.4% 50.95% 76.12% 101.33% Amperes Volts Amperes Volts Amperes Volts Amperes Volts 3.3 V 1.9 3.36 4.75 3.35 7.13 3.33 9.51 3.32 5 V 1.9 5.12 4.75 5.1 7.13 5.09 9.51 5.08 12 V 25.35 12.24 63.38 12.23 95.07 12.18 126.76 12.16\n\nLine Regulation\n\n(20% to 100% load) Voltage Ripple (mV) 20% Load 50% Load 75% Load 100% Load CL1\n\n12V CL2\n\n3.3V + 5V 3.3V 0.9% 8 8 12 12 10 12 5V 0.9% 8 8 14 12 12 14 12V 0.6% 16 12 14 20 14 12\n\nAs part of our standard testing, we test the primary protections of all PSUs we review (Over Current, Over Voltage, Over Power, and Short Circuit). All of the protections of the XPG Fusion Titanium function normally. The OCP protection is a bit more complex, as the unit is by default programmed not to allow more than 50A per 12V virtual rail but up to 133.3A total. This is to protect single cables and connectors, as drawing 130A from a single cable would be ruinous. Trying to draw more than 52-53A from a single connector will instantly trigger an OCP shutdown. With the single-rail 12V mode, the OCP protection is a bit slack, as we reached about 120% output on the 12V rail before the OCP immediately triggered a shutdown.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe XPG Fusion Titanium is one of the very few PSUs with a USB interface, allowing monitoring and customization via software. XPG integrated the Fusion Titanium within their Prime software package, which is used to control all compatible XPG devices (mainly keyboards and mice).\n\nOnce fired up, the XPG Prime will display some basic input and output electrical figures, such as the input voltage and output wattage. The input wattage does not appear but can be calculated by dividing the output wattage by the efficiency (i.e. 61 W / 0.7 = 87.1 W in this example). These readings are not terribly accurate but they are reasonably close to the actual figures.\n\nFrom the Power tab, users have limited control over the output voltages and OCP protection limits. By default, the output voltages are set to 12.2V, 5.1V, and 3.4V. Users can adjust the output voltage slightly but the range is so small that will not have any practical consequence on typical PCs. OCP figures can only be adjusted downwards, i.e. users cannot set OCP limits above the maximum ratings.\n\nThe Thermal tab allows users to choose one out of three cooling profiles, or even program their own. By default, the thermal profile unit is set to \u201cperformance\u201d mode. Switching to \u201csilent\u201d mode will keep the fan disabled up to a load of 600 Watts. Users can program their own cooling profiles and even disable active cooling completely if they want to - in any case, the unit\u2019s OTP protection will ignore the cooling profile if the temperatures get out of hand.\n\nFinally, the History tab is a record of the unit\u2019s basic electrical and thermal figures. Users can choose the sampling rate from minutes to days. \u201cDays\u201d is far too slow a sampling rate for electrical figures. Even \u201cMinutes\u201d is not useful for anything else than indicative records, as a rate of one record per minute cannot be used for any form of accurate measurements, let alone diagnostics. For the latter, the sampling rate would need to be at least in the milliseconds range.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe XPG Fusion Titanium 1600 PSU undoubtedly is an exceptional product that lives up to the company\u2019s extravagant marketing claims. It boasts excellent build quality, top-of-the-line components, and a clean design. Its OEM/ODM, Delta Electronics, is a renowned power electronics manufacturer that is known for producing top-quality products. XPG backs the unit up with a 12-year manufacturer warranty, which should be enough to dissolve any doubts regarding the quality level of the PSU.\n\nThe power supply's outstanding power quality is one of its key strengths, with great voltage filtering and very tight voltage regulation on every voltage rail. Filtering is astoundingly good for a unit with that high a power output. The electrical conversion efficiency is very high but not higher than expected for a unit that meets the 80Plus Titanium certification requirements. The unit also exhibits extreme resistance to thermal stress, operating unfazed regardless of the ambient temperature (within reasonable limits).\n\nWhile noise figures depend on the selected/programmed cooling profile, the XPG Fusion Titanium can typically operate silently with loads up to 500-600 Watts. However, if pressed to operate at loads above 1200 Watts for prolonged periods, it will inevitably produce high levels of noise. Typical gaming PCs and workstations cannot maintain such a high continuous power draw but rendering stations and mining rigs will.\n\nOverall, the XPG Fusion Titanium power supply is a halo product that is typically targeted towards hardcore enthusiasts and users who demand the very best, regardless of the price tag. And with an MSRP of $750, it definitely will be a very expensive product when it's released in May. However, for users who require extreme performance and reliability, this power supply is a solid investment that is worth every penny."

        "title": "Ripples from Wisconsin Supreme Court battle could reach the Hill - Roll Call",
        "content": "The fight to control Wisconsin\u2019s highest court has thrust the Midwestern battleground into the national spotlight as Election Day closes in on a pivotal race that could dictate future abortion and redistricting measures \u2014 and have implications for 2024.\n\nAt its core, the election Tuesday will determine the ideological split of the state Supreme Court. Liberals are within striking distance of securing a majority on the seven-member bench, which conservatives have dominated since 2008.\n\nThe officially nonpartisan race for the open slot pits liberal Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Janet Protasiewicz against conservative Daniel Kelly, a former state Supreme Court justice who lost his seat in an election three years ago.\n\nIn a state that boasts both a Democratic governor and strong Republican legislative majorities, the court\u2019s role is especially notable. Wisconsin justices have previously issued decisive rulings on district lines, laws that limited the power of the executive branch and a host of other issues.\n\nThe results are sure to have an impact on abortion access in Wisconsin. The procedure is subject to a near-total ban under a law that\u2019s been on the books for nearly 175 years. But the outcome will also decide the bench\u2019s makeup heading into the 2024 election cycle, where justices could once again be asked to rule on the results of the presidential contest.\n\nBeyond that, the heads of the state\u2019s Democratic and Republican parties see downstream impacts that could touch everything from the issues at play in 2024, when Wisconsin will host a key U.S. Senate election, to the partisan split of the state legislature and \u2014 potentially \u2014 the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of these races that has ripple effects that go in all directions,\u201d Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, said in an interview this week. \u201cAnd these go for a very, very long way because it\u2019s a 10-year term. Whoever wins will be in office during the next three presidential races and not only fights over the current maps, but also the 2031 redistricting.\u201d\n\nWith just days to go before voters head to the polls, the contest is already the most expensive state judicial race in history. WisPolitics.com, a Madison, Wis.-based news outlet, logged more than $40 million in spending, well beyond the $15.2 million Illinois state Supreme Court race in 2004 that previously held the national record, even after adjusting for inflation.\n\n\u201cYou need to come prepared for battle if you\u2019re running a campaign in Wisconsin,\u201d said Mark Jefferson, the executive director of the state Republican Party.\n\nShaping the \u201824 landscape\n\nThe cases that come before the court once the newly elected justice is seated in August may dictate some of the defining issues of the 2024 campaign in this crucial swing state.\n\nAnd if a challenge to the state\u2019s congressional lines makes it way to the court, Tuesday\u2019s election could help determine which party controls the House, where Republicans currently hold a slim majority nationally but a 6-2 edge in the state delegation.\n\nThe two seats occupied by Democrats include the bright-blue strongholds of Madison and Milwaukee.\n\nBut two others are seen as potential targets for those who may seek to redraw the map. They include the state\u2019s 3rd District, covering southwestern Wisconsin, which had long been held by Democratic Rep. Ron Kind until his retirement earlier this year. He was succeeded by Republican Derrick Van Orden, who won in November by about 4 percentage points. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales listed the seat as one of 66 in play next year, with a rating of Likely Republican.\n\nThe other is the southeastern 1st District, represented by Republican Bryan Steil, who won the 2018 election to replace retiring Speaker Paul D. Ryan following the Janesville Republican\u2019s two decades in office.\n\n\u201cIf we had fair maps, Democrats could be shooting to flip at least two House seats, and that\u2019s 40 percent of the national margin,\u201d Wikler said, referencing the net five seats Democrats would have to flip next year to take a majority. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other election in America in 2023 that will have a bigger impact on the House majority.\u201d\n\nWisconsin arrived at its current House maps after the state Supreme Court selected lines proposed by Gov. Tony Evers, though the Democratic executive was limited in his ability to make significant changes to the previously defined districts under an earlier Supreme Court order.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 efforts to raise the stakes for the Supreme Court race have also focused on abortion access, which was severely restricted in the state following the overturning of Roe v. Wade last year and subsequent reinstatement of a long-dormant 1849 state law that made performing the procedure a felony in most cases.\n\nWisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, has sued to overturn the abortion ban, and the case is likely to make it to the state Supreme Court.\n\nIf the court ultimately strikes down the law, Wikler, the Democratic state party chair, argued that \u201cthe threat to reproductive freedom\u201d then moves from the state to the federal level, where he said access could be endangered by a potential national abortion ban. That \u201cactually raises the stakes for the presidential race and the Senate race,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese questions around the freedom to access safe and legal abortion and democracy itself that were so central in 2022 and are so central 2023 with the Supreme Court race are likely to be on the front burner again in 2024,\u201d he said.\n\nJefferson, the state Republican Party\u2019s executive director, agreed that abortion could remain on the ballot in 2024 even if liberals win a majority on the bench, though he cautioned that it \u201cdepends how they handle\u201d setting restrictions around the procedure.\n\n\u201cIf they go as far left as they appear to be headed, that could also fire up conservative voters,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the issue may well not come off the table.\u201d\n\nSenators take sides\n\nOne of just a handful of states with a U.S. Senate delegation that\u2019s divided between the two parties, Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race could be seen as a proxy battle of sorts between Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson.\n\nBaldwin, who is up for reelection in 2024, swiftly moved to endorse Protasiewicz following her primary election victory in February. Baldwin has also hit the campaign trail, joining two former Obama administration aides and hosts of the political podcast \u201cPod Save America\u201d earlier this month in canvassing for Protasiewicz.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson has traveled the state backing Kelly. He\u2019s also invoked his reelection four months ago \u2014 a race he won by nearly 27,000 votes, or 1 percentage point \u2014 as part of his message to rally supporters. Johnsons said he knows \u201cwe have more than enough potential conservative votes to win the upcoming election,\u201d since more than 1.3 million cast ballots for him in November.\n\nTurnout in Wisconsin\u2019s spring elections is typically a fraction of that for November races. However, those figures are boosted when presidential primaries coincide with the court races, which was the case in 2020, when Kelly lost his seat. That year, the contest shared a ballot with the Democratic presidential primary, which was largely uncompetitive by the time Wisconsin weighed in.\n\nThat spring, turnout topped 35 percent. For comparison, nearly 73 percent of the state\u2019s voting-age population cast ballots in November 2020, according to data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\n\nOther members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation have also waded into the race. Democratic Reps. Mark Pocan and Gwen Moore both endorsed Protasiewicz, while Johnson joined the state\u2019s six House Republicans in penning a letter showcasing their support for Kelly.\n\nRep. Tom Tiffany, who has been mentioned as a possible challenger to Baldwin next year, is among the House Republicans active on the campaign trail.\n\nAmong national Democratic figures, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., headlined an online fundraising event the state Democratic Party held in recent days with cast members from \u201cGrease,\u201d and former President Barack Obama called on his Wisconsin Twitter followers to cast their ballots during the early voting window.\n\nMoney pours in\n\nThe election has shattered spending records, with money continuing to flood into Wisconsin as each of the candidates\u2019 campaigns rack up million-dollar-plus tabs.\n\nIn all, WisPolitics.com estimated this week that spending on the race has eclipsed $40 million since its start, with both sides now nearing parity after Protasiewicz, bolstered by a strong fundraising advantage, was able to initially blanket the airwaves before Kelly and his backers could launch a counter-offensive.\n\nProtasiewicz\u2019s upper hand in spending was evident in the latest fundraising reports, filed in recent days with the state Ethics Commission, showing she raised almost $12.4 million between Feb. 7 and March 20, compared with Kelly\u2019s $2.2 million over the same period.\n\nProtasiewicz\u2019s totals were boosted by $8.8 million in support from Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Party, and her report listed more than two dozen donors who maxed out their individual contribution limit of $20,000, most of whom came from out of state. That includes Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat.\n\nKelly\u2019s topline contributions were boosted by $500,000 from the state GOP, and most of the donors giving him the maximum were from Wisconsin, though Federalist Society Co-chair Leonard Leo was among the trio of top out-of-state donors during the period.\n\nOutside groups are also heavily involved. The state\u2019s biggest business lobby, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, is running issue ads, including a recent spot attacking Protasiewicz on crime. The conservative advocacy group is the top backer of the Kelly effort, spending $5.8 million in the lead up to the election, according to WisPolitics.com.\n\nScott Manley, the group\u2019s executive vice president of government relations, declined to confirm the exact level, but said in an interview the tally \u201cis far, far more money than we\u2019ve ever spent to educate the public on a Supreme Court race because there is so much at stake and we do care so much about having the rule of law preserved.\u201d\n\nThe race has also captured the attention of groups like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which works to elect more liberal candidates. The committee co-hosted an online event this week featuring former Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder in support of Protasiewicz.\n\nAsked about whether the race could set a precedent for future state contests, Jefferson, the Republican Party\u2019s executive director, predicted there won\u2019t be \u201cmany sleepy Supreme Court races moving forward\u201d and that the stakes of judicial elections will only grow \u2014 particularly if the bench is used to \u201ccircumvent the Legislature\u201d and its GOP majorities.\n\nStill, both he and Wikler cautioned against using the race and its results next week as a bellwether for 2024 elections, which are more than 19 months away. Recent Wisconsin history shows the danger of doing so; in 2008, the same year conservatives secured their enduring majority on the state Supreme Court by narrowly upsetting a liberal incumbent justice, Obama carried the state by 14 points over Republican nominee John McCain.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens, Wisconsin remains bright purple,\u201d Wikler said."
