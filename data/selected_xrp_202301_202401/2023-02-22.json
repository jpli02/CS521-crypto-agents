        "title": "Colliding black holes send ripples through the fabric of space-time - BGR",
        "content": "A new model could provide scientists with a better idea how gravitational waves, or ripples, created by colliding black holes affect the very fabric of space-time. The new model is part of research documented in a new paper published in the journal Physical Review Letters. According to the paper, when black holes collide or merge, they send a series of \u201crings\u201d throughout the universe.\n\nThis new model is important because it finally gives scientists a way to measure exactly how these ripples interact with one another as they travel through space-time. Being able to present a clearer picture of how colliding black holes create these ripples could also teach scientists more about the collisions themselves.\n\nScientists plan to use gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) to study the rippling events created by these black hole collisions. Previous models have always relied on linear mathematics without ever looking at how the waves influence each other. By looking at it with a new model, though, we could finally understand colliding black holes better.\n\nThe foundation of this new model was created by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) team. The program, which is run off of a supercomputer, simulates colliding black holes to better study the ripples created by the mergers. This allows the scientists to dig deeper, revealing non-linear effects that scientists haven\u2019t picked up on otherwise.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Further, doing this would allow us to broaden our understanding of colliding black holes and how those massive mergers actually affect our universe\u2019s very foundation. Additionally, it will help us determine if general relativity is the correct theory of gravity for black holes.\n\nBlack holes are also teaching scientists more about how the universe expands, and some even believe that these cosmic mysteries could be massive alien-created supercomputers for quantum data."

        "title": "Samsung Shoots Down Claims Of Galaxy S23 Ultra Display Defect With This Explanation - Hot Hardware",
        "content": "A growing number of Samsung S23 Ultra owners are reporting supposed bubbles or ripples near the corner of their phone displays. Should you be concerned? Samsung claims that you shouldn't.Concerns about the quality control of Samsung's latest flagship, the fantastic S23 Ultra, have started to roll in over on Twitter and Reddit . Owners of the rather pricey (stating at $1200, up to $1600) device are understandably chuffed that their displays are showing signs on bubbling or sub-surface cracks, mainly in the corner of the device. These alleged defects are only visible at certain angles with the light hitting them just right.Samsung is known for its fantastic, high-quality displays, with the S23 Ultra being no exception. Our review found that the 6.8\" quad-HD display is exceptional in terms of brightness and color reproduction as well as uniformity. There are always bad batches and/or QC errors, but with a device this expensive, it's normal for owners to demand and expect the best. Scanning through some of the responses in these posts, you'll see a fair share of owners sharing the same thing as the OP and others saying that the \"defects\" are totally normal.Well, Samsung heard their cries and has made an official response (via Samsung UK's Twitter account ) which largely amounts to, \"If you shine a strong light on the display, some parts may appear to be squashed/pressed, this happens because of the pressing process for waterproofing and dustproofing. This is not a product defect. Everything is fine with your phone.\"Digging further, Samsung had also addressed this same concern in March 2022, referring to reports for the S22 Ultra's very similar display. In that statement, the company states that the display is composed on multiple components pressed together, including the surface tempered glass. It says that \"Under strong light, lines after refraction of light may be seen at certain angles. This is a normal phenomenon and does not affect the function and life of the product.\"Basically, Samsung is saying that your mileage may vary on whether your phone has these lines or not, but they don't affect the usability or longevity of your device. What do you think? Should a $1600 phone be relatively free of such visual phenomenon, or would you let it slide based on Samsung's explanation?"

        "content": "Pacific Northwest kelp forests, and the sea creatures who depend on them, have been decimated since sea stars started disappearing.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The ocean exists in a delicate equilibrium \u2014 remove one species and the entire ecosystem can quickly be thrown off balance.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in 2013 when a mysterious ailment, known as sea star wasting disease, nearly wiped out populations of sea stars along the West Coast, all the way from Alaska to Baja California.\n\nWhile the cause of the disease is still yet to be determined, the cascading ripple effects are becoming clearer thanks in part to a new study from researchers at the University of Oregon and Oregon State University.\n\nOne species, the sunflower sea star, was hit particularly hard by the disease; and that\u2019s important because the sunflower sea star is a prolific predator.\n\n\u201cIt's big,\u201d Sarah Gravem, an associate biology researcher at Oregon State, said of the sea stars, which can grow up to 3 feet wide. \u201cIt's the size of an extra-large pizza. It has 20 arms and it's a voracious predator, especially of sea urchins.\u201d\n\nWithout sea stars to keep urchins in check, the echinoderms' populations exploded. Purple urchins feed on kelp and, in the aftermath of the sea star die-off, kelp forests have been decimated.\n\n\u201cThey have just been mowing down the kelp forests, eating those kelp down to like (nothing) and forming what are called \u2018urchin barrens,\u2019\u201d Gravem said.\n\nGravem said kelp acts as the \u201cfoundation\u201d upon which many other marine species depend. Small fish use the towering kelp fronds for refuge from predators, and other species, like abalone, depend on kelp for food.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s having cascading effects on literally hundreds of species,\u201d Gravem said.\n\nBut before the recent study, researchers had been unable to determine whether the die-off and the urchin barrens were definitively linked.\n\nTo find that link, Gravem and University of Oregon biologist Aaron Galloway delicately collected two dozen sea stars from areas off the Washington coast where they survived the disease.\n\nOver the course of several weeks, Gravem and Galloway observed the sea stars preying on urchins at the Friday Harbor Laboratory, using artificial intelligence to determine how frequently they fed and what their preferences were.\n\n\u201cWhat we were trying to do is really put numbers on it and put cause and effect onto all of these uncanny coincidences of wasting disease and kelp forest declines,\u201d Gravem said.\n\nTheir findings: the sunflower sea stars in their experiment consumed .68 urchins per day. Galloway conceded that the number, less than one, may not sound impressive, but it represents a breakthrough in knowledge of the species and the effect they can have when they're present in an environment.\n\n\u201cWe now know that they can eat .68 urchins a day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no number like that before.\u201d\n\nGravem and Galloway acknowledged that their results would need to be replicated in the wild, but even with their lab experiments, they said they\u2019ve shown that restoring sunflower sea star populations could potentially reinstate the equilibrium that was lost when the species disappeared.\n\nThere are still major hurdles to that plan, however. The animals have not shown appreciable recovery in any of the areas where they were killed off by the wasting disease.\n\n\u201cOur only chance of really recovering at the scale that needs to happen for our kelp forests is through recovery of predators,\u201d Galloway said\n\nRestoring their numbers, which were thought to be around 5 billion before the die-off, will take help from humans; whether that means transporting sea stars from areas where they survived or using captive breeding programs to repopulate wild sea stars.\n\nBut it needs to happen quickly, Gravem said."

        "title": "How Carbon Credits Can Finance Climate Action - Ripple",
        "content": "Ripple is committed to a sustainable future and acting on it every day by reducing the company\u2019s carbon footprint and reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 or sooner. Ripple\u2019s finance solutions leverage the XRP Ledger\u2014a fast, low-energy, and carbon-neutral public blockchain. And because innovative technology can play a catalytic role in successfully addressing some of the world's biggest challenges, such as climate change, Ripple supports companies building the infrastructure to scale equitable climate finance, and invests in innovative carbon removal projects.\n\nSince the $100m commitment announced last May, Ripple has made a significant move towards supporting high-impact carbon removal projects. Most notably, by pre-purchasing carbon credits from BC Biocarbon and CarbonCure in 2022\u2014representing the future removal of close to 120,000 metric tons of CO . Deploying capital through investments in carbon removal projects provides these promising technology companies an ability to launch additional projects in new regions, accelerating deployment of their methodologies while removing higher quantities of carbon from the atmosphere on a more aggressive timeline. The high-impact carbon credits resulting from these investments are expected to be delivered over the next five to seven years.\n\n\u201cThis investment will accelerate CarbonCure\u2019s active scaling and help us achieve our mission to reach 500 million metric tons of annual CO\u2082 reduction and removal by 2030\u2014equivalent to removing 100 million cars from the road each year,\u201d commented CarbonCure Technologies Founder and CEO Rob Niven.\n\nWhile the effects of carbon emissions on the environment are well documented, the pace of global reductions is not fast enough to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees celsius, as outlined in the revised Paris Agreement. Without action to both drastically reduce existing emissions and sequester carbon, the world will continue to experience rising sea levels, melting polar ice, more frequent and severe weather events, and countless instances of climate migration. In addition to drastic emission-reduction efforts, existing carbon sinks need to be protected and billions of tons of carbon dioxide need to be removed from the atmosphere.\n\nCarbon removal is emerging as a vital tool in the multi-front battle against climate change. Scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs are working relentlessly to develop and deploy technologies that can meaningfully reduce greenhouse gasses. However, the ability for such projects to quickly receive the necessary capital to scale production and lower costs is prevented by burdensome administrative processes and verification delays. Pre-purchase agreements represent an effective way to support the growth and development of breakthrough scalable technologies and carbon removal companies.\n\nBCB\u2019s biochar and CarbonCure\u2019s injection into concrete applications have both emerged as powerful new methodologies for scalable carbon removal with high permanence. These approaches also create value added benefits, such as biodiversity and greener, more durable construction materials.\n\nFor instance, when biochar is added to soil, it not only helps to improve soil fertility\u2014allowing crops and biodiversity to flourish\u2014but can sequester thousands of tons of CO2 each year. Reskilling labor plays a role here, as biorefineries leverage similar processes and employee skill sets to those of fossil fuel production, making it an economically promising alternative energy solution that is well within reach.\n\n\u201cBiochar is one of the most innovative and promising carbon removal methodologies we have to mitigate climate change because it not only removes and sequesters large amounts of CO , but also delivers a powerful array of ecological benefits,\u201d says Ken Weber, VP of Social Impact and Sustainability at Ripple.\n\nThe industrial sector is also seeing a green makeover with innovative options to produce cement and concrete\u2014significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions that release 8% of global CO\u2082 emissions annually. Concrete has massive potential to lock away carbon, and CarbonCure is one of the leaders of development in this space.\n\nWith hundreds of systems operating around the world, CarbonCure injects captured CO\u2082 into fresh concrete, where it is immediately mineralized and permanently locked away, reducing the amount of cement needed in each mix and lowering the concrete\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nComing Together to Combat Climate Change\n\nBy capturing and storing carbon dioxide, these technologies can help to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and mitigate the effects of rising temperatures and severe weather events. As the world continues to grapple with the effects of climate change, it is important to support the development of these and other promising technologies that can help to reduce the overall carbon footprint and protect the planet for future generations.\n\nLearn more about Ripple\u2019s impact strategy."
