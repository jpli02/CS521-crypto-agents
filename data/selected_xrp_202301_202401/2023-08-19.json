        "content": "Ripple\u2019s technology is suited to empower billions of people, propelling XRP adoption and driving its price towards $10,000.\n\nGlobal scalability will be key to achieving this ambitious goal according to Ripple co-founder Arthur Britto.\n\nMany in the crypto industry are fairly confident that the Ripple project will receive massive recognition and its native token XRP will rally. No one is more confident or as ambitious about the lengths that can be achieved in this regard as Ripple co-founder Arthur Britto.\n\nBritto expects Ripple to gain global recognition, empowering 7.5 billion people around the world. This will inevitably drive the native token of the project \u2018XRP\u2019 to a new all-time high. According to Britto, XRP is designed for a price of $10,000.\n\nReaching a global audience will be crucial factors in its long-term success and widespread adoption. Ripple plans to reach this global audience through a number of revolutionary products and services. One of its most successful products is its on-demand liquidity platform. Ripple\u2019s on-demand liquidity payments solution ensures that multinational businesses can complete cross-border payments with speed, ease, and cost efficiency. Ripple has opened numerous corridors with a key focus on Africa, South America, and Asia, where a majority of people face major hurdles in accessing financial services.\n\nWithout access to traditional financial services, these regions offer a great market for Ripple. Businesses also take advantage of products on offer to help accelerate their services on an international level.\n\nRelated: Ripple Unlocks Next-Level Treasury Management: ODL Revolution\n\nAt the time of press, XRP is a long way from the predicted $10,000 price tag. XRP is exchanging for $0.50 with a less than 1 percent change in the last 24 hours. The token has experienced some turbulence in the last couple of weeks, losing around 20 percent in the last 7 days.\n\nOne of the key drivers of the recent drop is the recent grant by Judge Torres for the SEC to possibly appeal the \u201cinterlocutory appeal\u201d motion in the Ripple case. As CNF reported, the legal rollercoaster began when the SEC announced its intention to appeal, a move they hinted at earlier in July. Following the permission granted by Judge Torres, the SEC has been given permission to file the motion for this appeal.\n\nInvestors expect prices to begin climbing back up with whales leading the market. Data shows that although XRP has been struggling, large investors are still backing it and buying at a discount. Market intelligence platform recently identified XRP as one of a number of altcoins that has witnessed increased activity from whales as they look to capitalize on the discounted prices.\n\nRead More: Ripple (XRP) Price Crashes Over 20% \u2013 Michael Saylor Will Fill His Bags, Should Investors Follow Suit?

        "content": "XLM price has taken the lead in recovering losses after the recent market-wide sell-off on August 17.\n\nInvestors seem to be more interested in Stellar\u2019s XLM token after SEC filed a motion that could contest the initial verdict of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit.\n\nIf things fall into place, a highly bullish case could see XLM double in value.\n\nThe SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit reached a temporary conclusion on July 13, with a partial win for Ripple. As a result, the XRP price rallied 100%. But now that the US Securities and Commission Exchange (SEC) is back and looking to file an interlocutory motion, the XRP token could be in trouble. The same is already being reflected in the chart, which has propelled XLM to the front.\n\nRead more: SEC vs Ripple, the legal battle intensifies as XRP holders expect new changes from SEC appeal\n\nXLM price takes XRP\u2019s spotlight\n\nXLM price rallied 107% on July 13 after the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit\u2019s decision was announced. But since then, XLM price has crashed 46% between July 13 and August 17 and currently trades at $0.120. Although the August 17 sell-off knocked the token down by 17%, the recovery rally has yielded nearly 17% gains for bottom buyers.\n\nXRP price suffered a more fatal blow than XLM on August 17, losing 28% of its value. But the remittance token has recovered nearly 18%, trading at around $0.506.\n\nA comparison of the two shows that the XLM price is already at pre-crash levels while the XRP price is struggling.\n\nXLM vs. XRP price performance\n\nAlso read: Can Shytoshi Kusama\u2019s plan to revive Shibarium undo Shiba Inu price losses?\n\nStellar\u2019s XLM token could rally another 100% if BTC aligns\n\nStellar\u2019s XLM price currently hovers around $0.121 after recovering 15% from the August 17 bottom at $0.105. If XLM price manages to recover above $0.127, it will signal a comeback from bulls and potentially propel Stellar by 37% to tag the next critical level at $0.166.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, XLM price could retest the $0.239 barrier, resting above which is buy-side liquidity. A sweep of this level seems likely, especially considering the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Wave Trend indicator, hinting at a potential reversal.\n\nThe RSI indicator bounces from the oversold zone, while the Wave Trend indicator contemplates a bullish crossover. The last time this happened, XLM price rallied 55% in roughly three weeks.\n\nIn addition to the bullish technicals, if SEC does proceed with the appeal and finds success, it could give XLM the upper hand.\n\nXLM/USDT 1-day chart\n\nAccording to the data analytics platform Chain of Demand, the volume for XLM as of August 19 hit $734,000, while XRP\u2019s hovers around $597,000. This sudden uptick further explains why XLM has a better chance of recovering from the slumps and also adds credence to the bullish thesis for Stellar.\n\nXLM vs. XRP volume chart\n\nOn the other hand, if XLM price breaches the $0.104 support level, it will create a lower low and invalidate the bullish thesis. Such a development could attract Stellar holders to sell, further triggering a 15% crash to the next stable support floor at $0.0949."

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Bad timing for BTC slump as markets weekend tranquil sets in - FXStreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin price wants back above the crucial support above $26,300, but waning momentum characteristic of the weekend won't let it.\n\nEthereum price can do nothing but follow BTC cues, with the $1,714 presenting as a hard nut to crack\n\nRipple price passes time around $0.5048; a drop to $0.4181 may be imminent amid gloomy macroeconomics in the XRP camp.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is down, but not out, only that the recent slump happened to close to the weekend, denying the market a chance for a rebuttal. As retail transitions to the weekend mode, the volume of trade is expected to reduce, with chances of few isolated large orders as whales step in. If they don't, BTC could step into the next week within the current low range. With it, Ethereum (ETH) price could follow suit, and for Ripple (XRP), unless something significant happens in the case against the US SEC, the remittance token may continue to mark time pending Monday August 21 updates.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: More BTC liquidations than during FTX fallout, what's next?\n\nBitcoin price looks for a possible tow\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is yet to recover from the 14% slump recorded during the evening hours of the US session. Currently auctioning at $26,036, BTC is below a crucial support level, the ascending trendline, which provided support for months, as indicated in the chart below.\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index (RSI) position at 18 and the histograms of the AO flashing red in growing volume, bears remain in the driver's seat. This means that Bitcoin price may still have a long ways to go before securing an uptrend.\n\nOne possible fundamental that could have steered Bitcoin price in the right direction is a favorable decision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning Grayscale's application for its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to be converted into an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). However, considering the commission has delayed for the second time, the weekend may not record any significant action unless whales step in to take advantage of the weekend tranquility.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIf sidelined investors and investors come in, Bitcoin price could find a footing to push north. While flipping the $$26,300 and $27,300 levels from resistance back to support would be a good sign, only a decisive candlestick close above the ascending trendline at $28,738 would invalidate the current gloom, with a possible foray to the $30,400 presenting next.\n\nAlso Read Bitcoin price dips to the $25,100 range with $820 million long positions liquidated across the market.\n\nEthereum price follows BTC on the heels\n\nEthereum (ETH) price reflects an almost similar outlook as BTC, indicating a long candlestick for the August 17 trading session and a short one for August 18 as the largest altcoin continues pulling north. This points to a tight correlation between BTC and ETH, with capital overflows from Bitcoin likely to drive Ethereum if the capital does come.\n\nAs in the case of BTC, the RSI is at 19, pointing to a weak price strength. The AO histogram bars do not inspire optimism either, pointing to the bears' position in the front row seats. Without a significant catalyst to drive Bitcoin price, ETH holders may remain within the $1,714 to $1,627 range for a while, possibly across the weekend.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, should Bitcoin price start moving, ETH would easily follow suit, drawing north to breach the $1,813 resistance level. Higher, it could traverse the $1,891 and $1,941 resistance levels, respectively, before an attempt to reclaim the May 6 and mid-July highs above the $2,000 psychological level. A decisive daily candlestick close above this level invalidates the current bearish outlook. It would constitute a 20% flight from the current level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Forecast: Indication of a 45% crash of bear trap?\n\nRipple price mark times around $0.5010\n\nRipple price has been stuck around the $0.5010 level for the better part of the day after pulling back 20% from the August 17 low of $0.4226. While the token also looks to Bitcoin for influence, a lot depends on the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC after the court approved the regulators' request for an interlocutory appeal.\n\nAs reported, the SEC wants the Howey Test revisited, with a potential overturning of the Ripple victory on July 13. Just as the partial victory sent XRP north by unprecedented margins, the possibility of an overturn inspires fears. With this, Ripple price could hover around the current level for a while or draw toward the $0.4191 support floor.\n\nThe RSI at 23, coupled with the bars of the AO histograms in the negative zone, bolsters the bears' case, indicating a possible slump.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a resurgence by XRP bulls could send Ripple price north, possibly foraying above the $0.5752 resistance level or higher past the $0.6840 level. In a highly bullish case, XRP could reclaim the $0.8193 resistance level, levels last seen around July.\n\nAlso Read: SEC vs Ripple, the legal battle intensifies as XRP holders expect new changes from SEC appeal"
