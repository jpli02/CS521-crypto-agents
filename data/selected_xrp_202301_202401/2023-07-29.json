Los Angeles has a highly diversified economy, people who work multiple jobs and consumers who can easily switch their spending to other things \u2013 sports, or video games \u2013 if, say, they run out of content that interests them on Netflix. One widely cited estimate put the economic cost of the 100-day writers\u2019 strike in 2007-2008 at more than $2bn, though other experts suggest that figure is greatly exaggerated.\n\nFor now, at least, community support for the strike is strong, and despite the economic upheavals \u2013 social media is rife with stories of people facing eviction or defaulting on their debts \u2013 it is difficult to find Angelenos outside studio executive suites who oppose what the writers and actors are fighting for.\n\nInitially, a perception took hold in some quarters that this was a dispute pitting Hollywood millionaires against each other, but that has shifted as the strike leaders have articulated their grievances and more people understand that the vast majority of actors and writers struggle like everyone else to make a decent living.\n\nAt the Warner Bros picket line one day last week, drivers zipping past in everything from a big food delivery truck to a beaten-up two-seater sedan honked in support. Some local businesses have started distributing free iced water or offering discounts even though they are tightening their own belts. \u201cPeople need help,\u201d said Patricia Rivera, who owns Tequilas Cantina & Grill and offers 15% off to any struggling union member, not just those on strike. \u201cWhen it was difficult for us, during the pandemic, many customers were there for us. This is about helping the community.\u201d\n\nKonstantine Anthony, the mayor of Burbank who is a former actor and a regular presence on the picket lines, said he\u2019d had several conversations with skeptical business owners and helped them understand that their own financial wellbeing was at stake, too. \u201cThey realize that if the actors and writers get less and less, they won\u2019t have money to spend,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThey see that they have more in common with the strikers than they thought.\u201d\n\nI stand by them in their fight.

It helps, too, that unions across different economic sectors have been vocal this summer about taking a stand against their employers and seeing all their struggles as one. Hotel workers, truck drivers and even strippers have shown up on the Hollywood picket lines, all of them arguing they are in the same fight for basic fairness against corporate executives who care about their shareholders more than their employees.\n\nMarsden, the outspoken restaurant owner, likened the fight to an attention-grabbing moment during the Covid lockdown when she erupted in fury at local elected officials because they wouldn\u2019t let her open her outdoor patio to diners, even though a Hollywood production was serving food to its workers in a parking lot less than 50ft away.\n\n\u201cI was calling out the big people who were picking and choosing who\u2019s essential and who isn\u2019t. That\u2019s the fight the actors and writers are in now,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have a choice \u2026 If they give in, the industry\u2019s not going to need them at some point. There are businesses that won\u2019t make it through if this goes on. But I do stand by them in their fight. I hope every other union will join them.\u201d"

Managers at spots in and around Burbank said they were seeing no signs yet of a drop-off in lunch custom, but they were experiencing unusual dead spots during the mornings and were thinking about cutting staff.\n\nFor businesses that depend more directly on film and TV production, the impact has been much more immediate. Jordyn Palos, who owns a public relations firm, said the strike was worse than Covid because at least then there was room to pivot to new ways of doing the job in cyberspace. \u201cNow,\u201d she wrote in the industry publication Variety, \u201cwe are being told we cannot do our jobs at all.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Greg Twiford, the head of a Hollywood animal trainers\u2019 association, said his members didn\u2019t know how much longer they could go on feeding their animals \u2013 everything from snakes and house pets to lions and elephants, many of them kept on ranches in the northern reaches of Los Angeles county where the mountains meet the desert.\n\n\u201cThe animals are starving,\u201d Twiford said. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in this industry: \u2018One day you\u2019re eating chicken, the next day you\u2019re eating feathers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a saying in this industry: \u2018One day you\u2019re eating chicken, the next day you\u2019re eating feathers\u2019 Greg Twiford\n\nAssessing the overall damage of a protracted strike is difficult. Los Angeles has a highly diversified economy, people who work multiple jobs and consumers who can easily switch their spending to other things \u2013 sports, or video games \u2013 if, say, they run out of content that interests them on Netflix. One widely cited estimate put the economic cost of the 100-day writers\u2019 strike in 2007-2008 at more than $2bn, though other experts suggest that figure is greatly exaggerated.\n\nFor now, at least, community support for the strike is strong, and despite the economic upheavals \u2013 social media is rife with stories of people facing eviction or defaulting on their debts \u2013 it is difficult to find Angelenos outside studio executive suites who oppose what the writers and actors are fighting for.\n\nInitially, a perception took hold in some quarters that this was a dispute pitting Hollywood millionaires against each other, but that has shifted as the strike leaders have articulated their grievances and more people understand that the vast majority of actors and writers struggle like everyone else to make a decent living.\n\nAt the Warner Bros picket line one day last week, drivers zipping past in everything from a big food delivery truck to a beaten-up two-seater sedan honked in support. Some local businesses have started distributing free iced water or offering discounts even though they are tightening their own belts. \u201cPeople need help,\u201d said Patricia Rivera, who owns Tequilas Cantina & Grill and offers 15% off to any struggling union member, not just those on strike. \u201cWhen it was difficult for us, during the pandemic, many customers were there for us. This is about helping the community.\u201d\n\nKonstantine Anthony, the mayor of Burbank who is a former actor and a regular presence on the picket lines, said he\u2019d had several conversations with skeptical business owners and helped them understand that their own financial wellbeing was at stake, too. \u201cThey realize that if the actors and writers get less and less, they won\u2019t have money to spend,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThey see that they have more in common with the strikers than they thought.\u201d\n\nI stand by them in their fight. I hope every other union will join them Angela Marsden of the Pineapple Hill Saloon & Grill\n\nIt certainly helps that many restaurants and bars employ aspiring actors. It helps, too, that unions across different economic sectors have been vocal this summer about taking a stand against their employers and seeing all their struggles as one. Hotel workers, truck drivers and even strippers have shown up on the Hollywood picket lines, all of them arguing they are in the same fight for basic fairness against corporate executives who care about their shareholders more than their employees.\n\nMarsden, the outspoken restaurant owner, likened the fight to an attention-grabbing moment during the Covid lockdown when she erupted in fury at local elected officials because they wouldn\u2019t let her open her outdoor patio to diners, even though a Hollywood production was serving food to its workers in a parking lot less than 50ft away.\n\n\u201cI was calling out the big people who were picking and choosing who\u2019s essential and who isn\u2019t. That\u2019s the fight the actors and writers are in now,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have a choice \u2026 If they give in, the industry\u2019s not going to need them at some point. There are businesses that won\u2019t make it through if this goes on. But I do stand by them in their fight. I hope every other union will join them.\u201d"
