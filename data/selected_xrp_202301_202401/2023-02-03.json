        "content": "He is a chef, restaurateur, New York Times Best Selling author, Emmy Award-winning TV host, and is one of the world\u2019s most recognizable and influential culinary stars. The Food Network host has been heading to Flavortown for 40 seasons and visited over 1,250 restaurants around the country.\n\nWithout input from Fieri, the website picked the best spot in every state. They went state by state and rounded up the \u201ctastiest and most \u201cfunkalicious\u201d food destinations featured on Triple-D.\u201d\n\nWhat is the tastiest restaurant in Indiana that Fieri has stopped?\n\nAccording to mashed.com, the honor goes to 3 Sisters Cafe in Indianapolis. Located at 6223 Guilford Avenue in Indianapolis, you\u2019ll find the Broad Ripple mainstay with a breakfast, lunch and drink menu. They are open daily from 9am to 3pm.\n\nMashed.com stated of 3 Sisters Cafe, \u201cThey say breakfast is the most important meal of the day \u2014 and that\u2019s definitely true in Indianapolis, where 3 Sisters Cafe is serving up unique and tasty culinary creations that have made it one of the most popular morning eateries in the city for more than two decades. Funny enough, there are no sisters involved in this operation, but there are specialties like the blueberry goat cheese pie, lemon corncakes, and French dip-style roast pork sandwiches.\u201d\n\nSide Bar- Insider.com says Fieri doesn\u2019t actually road trip across the country in his souped-up convertible. The Camaro is shipped on a trailer to each city that the show films in, and Fieri reportedly doesn\u2019t drive in it \u2014 he\u2019s just filmed opening and closing the car door."

        "title": "BIG Hits $20.50 Million in Presale, XRP has a New President - NewsWatch",
        "content": "Big Eyes Coin (BIG), a cat-themed meme coin, on Tuesday surpassed $20.50 million in its presale, which has entered Stage 10. In another important development on Tuesday, Ripple (XRP) welcomed its new president ahead of the verdict of its case against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBig Eyes Coin\u2019s Presale Enter Stage 10\n\nStage 10 of presale is in full swing for Big Eyes Coin, which has already raised more than $20 million. The unprecedented interest in the cat-themed meme coin has left industry experts in awe.\n\nStudded with innovative unique features, BIG looks all set to challenge the very best in the industry in the times to come.\n\nTime Still Left to Max Out\n\nThere is still some time left for traders and investors to get the most out of Stage 10 of presale. They can use the promotional code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 to get an unbelievable 200% bonus, a deal no one can afford to miss. The meme coin is speeding towards its launch and the time is now to get your hands on a stupendous bonus with Big Eyes Coin.\n\nXRP Welcomes New President\n\nIn another development, Monica Long, a long-time employee, took the reins of Ripple coin as the new president. However, the important development didn\u2019t have much impact on the coin\u2019s valuation as it dropped 3% or $0.400093 in the past 24 hours.\n\nRipple\u2019s current price shows a 15% gain in the last 30 days and it is 0.5% higher than the previous week\u2019s valuation.\n\nNew President: Experts Have Mixed Views\n\nThe appointment of the new president has come at a time when Ripple is expecting a decision in its case against the SEC.\n\nAmid speculations that Ripple\u2019s case might go to a full jury, the appointment of Monica Long as the new president fans some optimism for Ripple.\n\nWill this development have a ripple effect on the coin in the market? Only time has the answer to this riddle. However, experts have mixed opinions about the possible outcomes of the development for Ripple.\n\nMany believe that Ripple has a strong case and it will come out as a winner but others see SEC having the last laugh and the case could be going to a full jury trial.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently told CNBC that the case was close to its eventual end and it might be decided by the first half of 2023 or by the end of the year.\n\nCautious Investors Await the Verdict\n\nDespite the show of optimism by Ripple\u2019s top brass, traders are keenly observing the developments related to the case. This could be one of the major reasons why Ripple couldn\u2019t get the best out of the news regarding the installation of the new president in the last few sessions.\n\nIf Judge Torres decides to take the case to a full trial, things will become shaky for Ripple in the market because the longer the case will be dragged, the bigger its impact would be. This could lead Ripple to a substantial loss in the coming months.\n\nDoing the Math for Ripple\n\nMany holders have been calculating the possible outcomes in Ripple\u2019s case. Some believe a positive judgment would immediately take Ripple\u2019s valuation to around $1.30. Many of them see Ripple in the region of $10 in the longer run, which would be a 2400% jump from its current price.\n\nThe Latest in XRP-SEC Case in NY Federal Court\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc. and two of its executives for conducting an unregistered securities offering of XRP tokens is ongoing. The case is being heard in a New York federal court and both parties have submitted their arguments. The outcome of the case will likely have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency industry, as it will clarify the regulatory status of XRP and other digital assets. The federal court is expected to announce its verdict soon.\n\nFind Out More About Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL"

        "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2013 Pet owners face a potentially big problem as the veterinary field deals with a growing shortage of veterinarians.\n\nResearchers at Mars Vet Health claim a boom in pet adoptions, especially during the COVID pandemic, and the retirement of approximately 2,000 veterinarians each year have combined to create that shortage.\n\nThey now estimate nearly 41,000 additional veterinarians will be needed by 2030 to meet the growing demand.\n\nCurrently, some pet owners said they were already seeing delays in getting appointments with some practices booked weeks and months in advance.\n\nNews 6 investigated possible solutions.\n\nCertified technicians\n\nKelli Willis usually gets to work before the sun rises.\n\n\u201cHey, we got Noodle, here? I\u2019ve got a room ready for us,\u201d she said to a client at Newberry Animal Hospital in Gainesville.\n\nWillis has taken on some of the work traditionally performed by veterinarians as a certified veterinary technician.\n\n\u201cThe easiest way to explain this to people is I\u2019m basically a registered nurse, but for animals,\u201d she said. \u201cI do so much more than that. I\u2019m a nutritionist, I\u2019m a behaviorist, I\u2019m a phlebotomist, I\u2019m an X-ray technician, I\u2019m an anesthetist.\u201d\n\nSome point to Willis\u2019 job \u2014 a mid-level practitioner \u2014 as a possible solution to help ease the veterinarian shortage.\n\n\u201cI do think that maybe I am a solution, but I think that veterinary technicians, in general, and better utilization of them in the hospital is the solution to helping veterinarians with the staffing shortage,\u201d she said.\n\nWillis graduated from veterinary technician school, and she passed a licensing exam to earn her medical license. She has to renew that license every two years.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s important for people to understand what this job is. It\u2019s a really cool job,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, I get a lot of the patient interaction. I\u2019m the one that sees the patient first. I\u2019m the one that greets them. I get the feel for them. You know, if I walk into a room, and I see a dog that\u2019s nervous under the table, I\u2019m the first person to interact with them. That\u2019s so important to establish a good baseline and a good foundation for both the doctor and the client.\u201d\n\nNews 6 investigated more solutions at the largest gathering of veterinarians in the country \u2013 the annual VMX conference hosted by the North American Veterinary Community.\n\nThe VMX conference brought approximately 27,000 veterinarians to the Orange County Convention Center in 2023. (Copyright 2023 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.)\n\nCEO Gene O\u2019Neil said 27,000 veterinarians attended this year\u2019s event at the Orange County Convention Center.\n\n\u201cOf course, everyone\u2019s worried when they can\u2019t find staff to fill their hospitals and clinics,\u201d he said. \u201cDemand is up. Demand is definitely up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe number of pets has increased so very much,\u201d said Dr. Dana Varble, NAVC\u2019s chief veterinary officer. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that we\u2019re an unprepared industry. It\u2019s that the number of pets and the pet owning population and the way we treat our pets has changed so much over the last 10 to 20 years.\u201d\n\nExpanding vet med school admission\n\n\u201cThere are more attorneys in the District of Columbia than there are veterinarians in the entire United States,\u201d NAVC President Dr. Bob Lester said. \u201cThe demand for those veterinarians has never been larger.\u201d\n\nLester said the expected shortage is not the result of a lack of interest.\n\n\u201cThe good news is there are record numbers of applicants to veterinary schools,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge is finding enough seats for them.\u201d\n\nNews 6 examined the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Florida.\n\nIn 2022, that college announced it opened 30 more spots for students to apply for.\n\nOut of 1,922 applications, the school accepted only 150 students.\n\nResearchers estimated 26,000 veterinary students will graduate by 2030 nationally, which still leaves a void of about 15,000 veterinarians.\n\nDr. Nicole Bruno, of Houston, said part of the solution is getting children interested in becoming a veterinarian at an early age.\n\nMiddle school students experiment with veterinary tools as part of an effort to introduce them to veterinary medicine at the VMX conference in Orlando. (Copyright 2023 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.)\n\n\u201cWhen I decided I wanted to be a vet, I did not have the opportunities to have exposure to the profession,\u201d she said. \u201cI also didn\u2019t see myself in the profession.\u201d\n\nBruno said nearly 94% of veterinarians are white, and as a Black woman, she felt is was important for the next generation to see themselves in her job.\n\nFor the first time, she organized a session at the VMX convention where middle school students explored what it was like being a veterinarian.\n\n\u201cOnce I became a vet, I always said I was going to pay it forward,\u201d she said. \u201cDoing programs like this really is my passion to kind of help students see themselves in the profession and know what they need to do next steps to become veterinarians.\u201d\n\nIn one room, students were introduced to microscopes, lab coats and listening to the heart beats of real puppies.\n\nIn another room, their parents listened to experts explain what their students needed to focus on in school to qualify for veterinary school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very competitive to get to vet school, and you need to know that you want to be a vet and all the opportunities that are there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sooner that you can get exposure as a child, as soon as you know what the steps are, the better we can keep them on the pipeline, because we need our veterinarians. We need us.\u201d\n\nVirtual visits\n\n\u201cSince COVID, the pet population has just gone crazy,\u201d Dr. Cheryl Good said.\n\nGood runs a practice in Dearborn, Michigan, and she said virtual visits with pet owners are helping her and others meet the rising demand.\n\n\u201cWe can see our patients sooner, you know? They don\u2019t have to wait the three or four weeks to come into the office,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said her virtual visits have grown from one or two per month to five or six per day.\n\n\u201cTelemedicine is a game changer in that way because you can see them in their own environment,\u201d she said.\n\nVirtual or in-person, Willis said she stands by ready to help.\n\n\u201cI think that that is ultimately why we\u2019re here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to take care of patients, and we\u2019re here to help clients take care of their animals in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to every episode of Florida\u2019s Fourth Estate in the media player below:"

        "content": "Mrs Drishti Bablani believes that small acts of kindness can contribute to the betterment of society and improve the lives of the less fortunate.\n\nThis mindset inspired her to start a movement called The Kindness Ripple in April 2018. It focuses on collecting and donating food to charity organisations in Singapore and has grown from a few volunteers to 45 - 60 per cent of whom are women.\n\n\"The inspiration for starting the movement was the will in me and many people around me to give back to society,\" said Mrs Bablani, who is delivery manager regulatory with Standard Chartered Bank.\n\n\"I realised that there are many people who want to help and give back in small ways but most feel what they can do is so little that it would not make much difference.\"\n\nThe 46-year-old wanted to \"help people see the true power of their humble contributions\".\n\n\"I wanted to bring home the point that small acts of kindness can create a big impact if done collectively, in one direction,\" she said.\n\nMrs Bablani did not get may opportunities to do voluntary work in Adipur, a town in Gujarat, India, where she grew up as her life revolved around her family and close friends.\n\nShe went on to do engineering at L.D. College in Ahmedabad and worked in Mumbai and Gurugram, before getting married to IT professional Dhiraj Bablani, who is one year older than her, in March 2000 and moving to Singapore in 2006.\n\n\"We both joined Polaris Software Labs (now Virtusa Singapore) before moving on to JP Morgan Chase, Citibank and Standard Chartered Bank,\" she said.\n\n\"I was well educated but my lifestyle was very Indian.\n\n\"Singapore was a more global place and it opened my eyes to many things that I did not know about.\n\n\"Our initial plan was to make some money and go back to India after two years. But we decided to stay on as Singapore was amazingly convenient.\n\n\"It is so well planned - there are shopping malls at walking distance from anywhere you stay. Public transport is superb, there are clear signboards everywhere and it is a very welcoming society.\"\n\nThe family (which has grown with daughters Teesha, 13, and Yuvika, 10), did get help from colleagues in the initial years to settle down, and gradually \"found our own little family of lovely friends\".\n\nMr Stan Lim, a Singaporean colleague, told them about the best places to rent, while other Indian colleagues pointed out where to buy Indian goods and the best Indian restaurants..\n\nThey also joined Indian organisations such as the Singapore Sindhi Association and Singapore Gujarati Society.\n\n\"We loved the cultural integration that we saw in Singapore,\" said Mrs Bablani. \"Every festival was celebrated on a grand scale. Eventually we did not miss home so much. Singapore became home without us realising it.\"\n\nMrs Bablani decided to volunteer when her husband was deputed to London for a year in 2018.\n\n\"I had time on my hands and wanted to do something meaningful,\" she said.\n\n\"I went to Willing Hearts' soup kitchen with my mother and we cut vegetables because we are vegetarians.\n\n\"Wholly run by volunteers, the soup kitchen prepares, cooks and distributes about 7,000 daily meals to over 70 locations island-wide. I was simply awestruck.\n\n\"That day, as I returned home, I realised the impact that this group of volunteers were creating. Then and there I decided that I would collect food items and distribute them to the needy.\"\n\nInitially, Mrs Bablani and a few friends collected all kinds of food items and rice bags from donors. But they found it a difficult physical task - storage space was also hard to find.\n\nSo, from 2020, the volunteers began to collect funds from donors and ordered the rice online which was then delivered by the vendors directly to the beneficiary organisations.\n\n\"I decided to narrow it down to rice because it's the staple food for most people,\" said Mrs Bablani. \"Besides, it is easy to handle.\n\n\"I shared my idea and objectives with my friends and associates and those who were like-minded joined in. My Kindness Ripple movement grew to 45 volunteers.\"\n\nHer modus operandi was simple: The volunteer leaders would reach out to their network via phone and social media requesting contributions and then each one would choose one beneficiary organisation to which the collections would be sent.\n\nShe developed a good bunch of women volunteers \"because women are very philanthropic by nature\".\n\n\"They are always keen to help,\" said Mrs Bablani. \"Most of them are working, but do not mind spending time collecting funds for our food drive.\"\n\nIn 2018, The Kindness Ripple's 28 volunteers collected 1,300kg of food items and donated them to Food Bank Singapore.\n\nIn 2021, they set a Singapore Book of Records feat by donating 35,280kg of rice to six beneficiaries.\n\nLast year, they collected 32,750kg of rice, which was donated to Sunlove Home, Sree Narayana Mission, Willing Hearts, Food From The Heart, Annalakshmi Community Meals Programme, SWAMI Home and Lions Home for the Elders.\n\n\"I have worked with Drishti since the start,\" said homemaker Rupali Nagpal, a volunteer leader with The Kindness Ripple.\n\n\"I was moved by her enthusiasm, selflessness and zeal in leading the initiative. I hope to continue working with her and others in trying to make a difference and contribute to society.\"\n\nEntrepreneur Neetu Vaswani said: \"Drishti motivated me by giving me the confidence that I can be a string in this noble cause. Her humble nature and strong motive to help all is remarkable.\"\n\nMountbatten MP Lim Biow Chuan has praised Mrs Bablani's work.\n\n\"We can all extend simple acts of kindness to everyone. The ripple of kindness which Mrs Bablani started will make Singapore a better place for all,\" said Mr Lim.\n\n\"I just want to say to all the volunteers - well done! You are the people that make Singapore special.\n\n\"You are the people who have said that in good and bad times we want to step forward we want to make a difference in the life of others.\"\n\nMrs Bablani and her family are now integrated into Singapore society and have embraced the culture and traditions.\n\n\"We love to celebrate every festive occasion with our group of friends,\" she said.\n\n\"We love to celebrate Chinese New Year, my kids especially look forward forward to the hongbao every year.\n\n\"Lo hei is another hit with them as we have lots of fun. We also love the mooncakes and local food, especially Peranakan.\n\nIn 2015, Mrs Bablani became became a Singapore citizen.\n\n\"I love everything about Singapore, especially its multi-racial culture, receptiveness to other traditions and customs, futuristic planning, safety and great infrastructure,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm 100 per cent Singaporean now. This is home and I feel safe, well settled and well integrated. Going back to India is not something that I foresee.\"\n\nMrs Bablani feels it is important to do voluntary work as it will help Singapore immensely.\n\n\"If there are problems around us in the society, let us be the ones who act and help resolve them,\" she said.\n\n\"Our small contributions can make a big difference. I hope this inspires people to keep believing in the power of small acts of kindness.\"\n\nMrs Bablani hopes to organise her rice donation initiative every year and add more volunteers to her group.\n\nsantosh@sph.com.sg\n\n\"I love everything about Singapore, especially its multi-racial culture, receptiveness to other traditions and customs, futuristic planning, safety and great infrastructure.

        "title": "Ripple Bought $8.4B XRP Since SEC Lawsuit 'To Support Healthy Markets' - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ripple Labs\u2019 XRP token has dropped 20% since the SEC sued the firm, and two top executives, over alleged unregistered securities sales back in December 2020.\n\nAnd since then, Ripple Labs has poured billions of dollars into buying back the XRP token on secondary markets.\n\nSome reports have focused on Ripple Labs\u2019 direct XRP sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. The move to acquire XRP tokens \u2014 ostensibly a bullish indicator \u2014 has been trumpeted as boosting the ecosystem\u2019s liquidity.\n\nThose reports often link the nearly $3 billion of in-house sales to XRP\u2019s fast-moving 27% pump in January. They have propped up a narrative in which XRP\u2019s latest revival has been made all the more notable by the fact that it\u2019s played out with an uncertain, and, likely decisive, regulatory outcome hanging in the balance.\n\nThose sales specifically refer to institutions and other corporate clients acquiring XRP from Ripple directly for use within its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network, a product pitched to help smooth the cross-border remittance process via XRP-powered crypto rails.\n\nBlockworks compiled the full six-year history of Ripple Labs\u2019 quarterly markets reports, stretching back to the inaugural edition in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\nRipple\u2019s direct XRP sales only tell one part of the story. It\u2019s true that Ripple sold around $2.97 billion of XRP last quarter \u2014 on par with the previous period\u2019s $2.82 billion \u2014 but the reality is that Ripple has appeared to push much of that money into buying XRP on public markets, per its own disclosures.\n\nIn total, Ripple Labs has publicly reported $11.1 billion in ODL-related sales from the beginning of 2021 until the end of 2022. Since then, the firm has shelled out nearly $8.4 billion throughout a sustained XRP buying campaign initially pitched to protect the token\u2019s markets and its customers, averaging more than $1 billion per quarter.\n\nRipple Labs\u2019 disclosures indicate the firm has, since the SEC\u2019s charges, essentially recycled 75% of the revenue generated from direct XRP sales on buying its own token on secondary markets, and 67% of overall sales revenue from the start of 2016\u2019s fourth quarter.\n\nBlockworks reached out to several contacts at Ripple on multiple occasions with the specific details contained in this story, and did not receive any response.\n\nRipple spends billions on XRP market \u2018health\u2019\n\nCollating figures contained in each of Ripple\u2019s quarterly market reports (including the most recent), across the six years of disclosures, Blockworks found that Ripple sold $12.55 billion in XRP directly to customers across that period.\n\nOf that, $744.6 million was sold \u201cprogrammatically,\u201d a common term for selling on public markets, such as crypto exchanges.\n\nRipple stopped programmatic sales after the third quarter of 2019. No particular reason was given in the underlying disclosure. But the firm then said it was focusing on over the counter (OTC) sales with partners working in \u201cstrategically important\u201d regions including EMEA and Asia.\n\nThe following year, Ripple said it was focusing \u201csolely on its OTC sales as part of providing increased XRP liquidity to RippleNet\u2019s ODL customers.\u201d It described that liquidity as \u201cvital\u201d as ODL grows.\n\nRipple first disclosed that it was an XRP buyer on secondary markets in 2020\u2019s second quarter, although purchase figures didn\u2019t appear until the third quarter of that same year.\n\n\u201cA healthy, orderly XRP market is required to minimize cost and risk for customers, and Ripple plays a responsible role in the liquidity process,\u201d Ripple said in Q2 2020.\n\n\u201cAs more financial institutions leverage RippleNet\u2019s ODL service, more liquidity is added into the XRP market. That said, Ripple has been a buyer in the secondary market and may continue to undertake purchases in the future at market prices.\u201d\n\nTo start, Ripple Labs was snapping up around $40 million per quarter, in Q3 and Q4 2020. It then took a break until Q4 2021, when it ramped up efforts significantly by spending $322 million.\n\nAround $1.08 billion was spent in the first three months of 2022, then $1.71 billion in the following quarter. That expenditure jumped almost 50% in the quarter after that, when Ripple reported $2.5 billion in secondary purchases.\n\nLast quarter, it spent $2.74 billion on XRP. The price of XRP, meanwhile, dropped by 30%.\n\nRipple described its buying campaign as a \u201cnear-term product solution\u201d for an XRP lending operation announced in Oct. 2020.\n\nThe firm said in its Q3 2020 report that it was building \u201cnew ODL capabilities to dynamically source XRP liquidity from the open market, not just Ripple,\u201d hinting that its XRP buys on secondary markets would eventually slow \u2014 but its budget for XRP buybacks has only increased.\n\nCentralization and securities laws\n\nThe question of whether XRP and its underlying crypto infrastructure are sufficiently decentralized to avoid SEC scrutiny plagued San Francisco-headquartered Ripple Labs for years.\n\nThat debate culminated in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit, which seeks to prove that purchases of the XRP token constitute investment contracts. Ripple Labs holds sway over the network and the value XRP, the regulator has argued, which would mean that its token offering falls under securities law per the Howey test.\n\nCompanies selling securities must register with the SEC and lodge regular financial disclosures, among other things, in order to provide reliable information on which investors can base their decisions.\n\nIn a landmark speech in 2018, William Hinman of the SEC noted that \u201cIf the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized \u2013 where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts \u2013 the assets may not represent an investment contract.\u201d He specifically named Bitcoin and Ethereum as tokens that met this standard. XRP\u2019s omission from his speech was the first sign that XRP was potentially under the gun.\n\nStill, decentralization is a spectrum, and there are many ways by which to gauge decentralization of crypto projects. Some relate to their technological underpinnings \u2014 how many validator nodes the network has, for example, and how they\u2019re chosen.\n\nAnother is the centralization of supply; if one party holds too many tokens, they could wield outsized influence over markets.\n\nIn October 2022, Ripple declared that it \u2014 for the first time \u2014 owned less than 50% of the outstanding supply of XRP, which is currently about 50.8 billion ($21.08 billion). In 2017, that figure was as high as 61%.\n\nRipple distributing XRP through its direct and ODL-related sales contributed to that reduction.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to gauge the actual market impact of Ripple consistently buying so much XRP over the past two years (it\u2019s now the sixth largest digital asset by market value, in 2015 it was the second-biggest behind bitcoin).\n\nBuybacks common Wall Street practice\n\nWhile order book depth is a fluid metric and changes rapidly, CoinGecko recently placed the 2% depth of Binance\u2019s XRP/USDT market at about $2.3 million on the upside and $1.6 million on the downside \u2014 meaning bids of those sizes would shift XRP\u2019s price 2% in either direction.\n\nWhen averaged out on a daily basis, Ripple\u2019s XRP buys over 2022 would\u2019ve amounted to $22 million per day \u2013 more than 10 times the reported amount required to move the needle on markets. (Ripple disclosed sales were executed daily in its Q2 2017 report, although no information has been given about the rate of purchases)\n\nRipple has openly telegraphed its buys. And, for what it\u2019s worth, token buyback schemes are common in crypto markets. Crypto exchange tokens often acquire and burn their own tokens; crypto lender Nexo has been running buybacks for years, a move that has carried over to buzzy projects like BitDAO.\n\n(Ripple doesn\u2019t burn XRP directly, instead its ledger automatically burns a small amount for every transaction).\n\nToken buybacks, while an unregulated process, mimic stock buybacks seen in traditional equities markets (which are all securities). Meta just announced a $40 billion buyback scheme which appears to have heavily influenced its recent 27% rally, despite somewhat lackluster earnings.\n\nStock buyback schemes are intended to return capital to shareholders. They can present their own concerns, including executive compensation gaming and destroying long-term value propositions.\n\nXRP has more-or-less tracked bitcoin since SEC filed its charges\n\nWhether XRP is a security has yet to be determined. A ruling is expected sometime this year.\n\nOn Dec. 22, the day SEC filed charges against Ripple, co-founder Chris Larsen and CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the latter stated in a blog: \u201cUnlike securities, the market value of XRP has not been correlated with Ripple\u2019s activities. Instead, the price of XRP is correlated to the movement of other virtual currencies.\u201d\n\nCrypto prices across the board indeed tend to correlate. But based on Ripple\u2019s own disclosures, it\u2019s clear the firm has been busy directly maintaining the \u201chealth\u201d of XRP markets throughout its battle with the SEC \u2014 to the tune of billions \u2014 all while attempting to disprove its influence over XRP.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
