        "title": "The Many Ripple Effects of the Weight-Loss Industry - The Atlantic",
        "content": "I\u2019ve been heavy my whole life, pretty much from the get-go. Nevertheless, I\u2019ve had few interactions with the weight-loss industry, except that I did the Atkins thing back in the day. That was always handy for beating back a few pounds. I was never altogether that worried about my weight; I\u2019ve always had a reasonably active lifestyle with hiking, hunting, bicycling. Never \u201cexercise,\u201d just things I liked to do.\n\nIn the past decade, though, things have gotten away from me. Getting older, the confines of city living, a sedentary job, and sedentary hobbies have all contributed. My weight has crept up until it\u2019s significantly impacted my quality of life. It\u2019s harder to do the things I\u2019ve always enjoyed. I\u2019ve got kids whom I have to keep up with and clean up after, and it\u2019s just getting harder all the time.\n\nIt was easier to diet when I was a single man. Now I have to cook for my kids, and they\u2019re not going to eat low-carb and such. I don\u2019t have the time for fixing two meals, and who can say no to mac and cheese when it\u2019s right there?! And I made it myself, so I know it\u2019s good.\n\nThe doctors all want to hack a length of my guts out, which seems like a terrible idea. I respect their expertise, of course, but it just seems too extreme a thing to do when I am otherwise healthy as an ox. My heart\u2019s good, blood pressure\u2019s fine, cholesterol and blood sugar are fine. I\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s done to some other folks of my acquaintance, and while it has made them slimmer, it\u2019s caused some issues too. I don\u2019t love the trade-off.\n\nLong story short, I\u2019d love to take a drug that reduces my appetite. I suppose I should indulge in all the self-flagellation that we fat people are supposed to engage in, that I should diet and have self-control. But I know who I am. I don\u2019t apologize for enjoying a good hearty meal. It\u2019s bliss.\n\nAlso, I am a man whose work as a librarian requires that I be helpful and friendly all the time, and I struggle with being friendly when I\u2019m hungry. Who doesn't? A jolly fat man is great for customer service. A grouchy thin one? Not so much.\n\nBut I\u2019m told that I have to go through a whole bunch of hoops to get my insurance to pay for weight-loss drugs, and frankly I don\u2019t have the time for all that. I\u2019d pay out of pocket, but they\u2019re not available at a price point I can afford. Perhaps their cost will come down a bit over time. Until then, I\u2019ll just have to figure out the diet and exercise thing. I\u2019ve done it before. It\u2019s just harder now that I have a family and a full-time job and am a tired middle-aged man."

        "title": "Ripple CTO Describes XRP Buyback Theory as an \u2018Awful\u2019 Lot of \u2018Scam\u2019 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Should the United States consider making XRP the reserve currency of the world and buy its entire holding from the market?\n\nWell, this speculative idea floated by Jimmy Vallee, Managing Director of Valhill Capital, in 2021 is once again doing rounds after he talked about it in a recent interview.\n\nBut Ripple Lab\u2019s CTO David Schwartz says he has not even looked at it closely.\n\nSounds Like a Scam\n\nThe latest to rubbish Vallee\u2019s speculative buyback theory is Ripple\u2019s CTO, David Schwartz, who called it a scam in a tweet on Monday.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t looked at it very closely. But what I have seen looks an awful lot like a scam to me. If we\u2019ve learned anything from 2012 and 2022 it\u2019s that anyone promising high returns with low risk is almost certainly going to rob you,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\nThe XRP buyback theory has been dismissed by many others in the crypto world, most importantly by Ripple\u2019s former director of developer relations, Matt Hamilton, who, in a long Twitter thread on January 12, termed Vallee\u2019s idea as a complete fantasy and accused him of indulging in bribery.\n\nWhat Is XRP Buyback Theory?\n\nKnown as Vallee\u2019s Buyback Theory, it calls upon governments to buy back the entire XRP supply from retail. Vallee also gives a price for XRP\u2019s buyback, an eye-popping $37,500 per token, calculated by dividing total global wealth by the asset\u2019s total supply, media reports said. Over the past few weeks, XRP has been trading at the $0.40 level.\n\nWhile no one takes Vallee\u2019s buyback idea seriously, the XRP community can\u2019t stop speculating if it ever plays out in reality.\n\nSchwartz shooting down the speculative hypothesis as a scam is apparently an attempt to ensure the community doesn\u2019t get swayed away.\n\nAttorney Deaton\u2019s Clarification\n\nVallee\u2019s interview with the investor, analyst, and business coach Molly Elmore on December 28 added a new dimension to the ongoing saga of theory. He mentioned Attorney John E. Deaton, who has been helping the court in the Ripple vs. SEC case, where he has been \u201cfighting SEC outreach.\u201d\n\nIn the third year now, the case is likely to be resolved in less than six months, Ripple\u2019s CEO Brad Garlinghouse said recently.\n\nVallee proposed that on behalf of XRP holders, Deaton should be paid, in the event of a buyback, for his efforts to help Ripple in the aforementioned case.\n\nOn February 3, Deaton distanced himself from Vallee\u2019s statements, saying he has zero expectation to be paid for \u201cfighting SEC\u2019s overreach.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless I file an appearance as a defense counsel representing a Company that is being sued by the SEC, my efforts will continue to be pro bono. I will NOT accept any money from any token holders related to my efforts,\u201d he said in one of his tweets."

        "title": "Why icicles are rippled - Phys.org",
        "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\n(a) Typical icicles found in nature (photo by K. Purdy). (b) Schematic representation of the ripple growth theory proposed by Ueno, with ice on the left and air on the right. A perturbative expansion is chosen to be an amplified wave at the solid-liquid interface. Both gravity and surface tension oppose this morphology on the liquid-air interface. Therefore the latent heat (depicted by curved red arrows) from the concave areas has a longer convection distance before it is released in the air than the latent heat of the convex area. The combination with gravity-driven flow (Q) causes a complex disturbance of the heat flux, resulting in an instability that produces ripples with a wavelength of approximately 1 cm. Credit: Physical Review Applied (2023). DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevApplied.19.024005\n\nWinter is coming to an end; the last nights of below zero temperatures are here. In the morning, one still spots the occasional icicle on a gutter or car bumper. When you look at these icicles carefully, you may notice that they show a characteristic pattern of ripples\u2014always around one centimeter wide. What causes these ripples? Using an icicle machine of their own design, physicists and chemists from the University of Amsterdam investigated this question, and discovered that salt plays an important part in the formation process of the ripples.\n\nThe research was carried out by Ph.D. student Menno Demmenie and his colleagues of the Institute of Physics and the Van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences at the University of Amsterdam. The results were published in Physical Review Applied.\n\nIcicle machine\n\nTo carry out the research, Demmenie and his colleagues built an actual icicle machine. \"In a large freezer with a window, we spent a few weeks becoming true icicle growth specialists,\" Demmenie recalls.\n\n\"The difficult question was how fast water must be added to make a nice icicle. If the water flows too quickly, one loses a relatively large amount of water, turning the floor of the freezer into a sheet of ice. On the other hand, if the flow of water is dialed down too much, the icicle tends to grow upward, like a stalagmite. Eventually we discovered that the optimal rate of growth occurs using an inflow of sixty milliliters per hour, at a temperature of -15 \u00b0C. This is comparable to a faucet dripping roughly once every three seconds.\"\n\nOnce the correct inflow of water was found, the researchers could proceed. Using their machine they made many different icicles, under different circumstances and with different types of water. In the end, the crucial factor in the formation of icicle ripples turned out to be the concentration of salt in the water that was used. The image below shows icicles with different concentrations of salt, from an icicle made of extremely pure water (left) to icicles in relatively salty water (right). With the increase of the concentration of salt, the ripples on the icicles became more clearly visible.\n\nWhen the icicles contained more salt (concentration in moles per litre) the ripples on the icicle became more clearly visible. (The salt moreover causes the icicle to be less transparent.). Credit: Physical Review Applied (2023). DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevApplied.19.024005\n\nThe researchers used a clever trick to investigate the role that salt plays in the formation of icicles. When the water forming an icicle freezes, salt molecules get pushed out of the ice as \"impurities.\" As a result, most of the salt is found in a thin layer of liquid water on the outside of the icicle. The scientists added a coloring agent to the water they used, which underwent the same process as the salt molecules. This allowed them to nicely visualize where the liquid salty water was present.\n\nRipples explained\n\nIn this way, it was discovered that the flow of liquid water caused the ripples to appear. Using pure water, the layer of salty liquid water around the icicle was absent, and the formation process looked more like a dripping candle. When saltier water was used, the icicle was surrounded by a thin film of liquid, salty water, and the flow of that water created the regular ripples. The more salt the water contained, the stronger the process, causing thicker ripples to eventually form.\n\nIn nature, water always contains a small concentration of salt. This explains the beautiful structures we find on our gutters and car bumpers in the morning\u2014rippled by a thin layer of slightly salty water that was at work throughout the night.\n\nMore information: Menno Demmenie et al, Growth and Form of Rippled Icicles, Physical Review Applied (2023).

        "title": "The ripple effects of layoffs - BBC.com",
        "content": "The toll of layoff anxiety\n\n6 February 2023 By Josie Cox , Features correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nAs companies around the globe slash positions, many workers are steeping in worry that they\u2019re next.\n\n\u201cEvery morning, before I even get out of bed, I\u2019m overcome by a sense of dread,\u201d says Kara, a 41-year-old tech worker, based in New York City. She\u2019s been at her company for four years \u2013 but she says she \u201cknows\u201d she\u2019ll probably get cut. \u201cI\u2019m basically 100% sure that one of these days, I\u2019ll get the email saying that my position\u2019s been eliminated \u2026 It\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d\n\nFor Kara, whose full name is being withheld for career considerations, layoffs have already had a considerable impact on her life, even though she hasn\u2019t lost her job. She\u2019s anxious, sleeps poorly and cries a lot, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the uncertainty that\u2019s the worst. Part of me thinks I should just resign to save my nerves, but it might be exactly the same somewhere else,\u201d she says. \u201cJob security in this sector is basically a myth.\u201d\n\nAs layoffs have swept the globe in the past year \u2013 and particularly in the past four months \u2013 thousands who considered themselves relatively secure in their positions have found themselves out of work. In tech, for instance, companies cut more than 150,000 workers in 2022, according to tracking site Layoffs.fyi; this year already, they\u2019ve trimmed almost 76,000 more roles. In the finance industry, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have slashed thousands of positions. And many other industries have also been touched by the redundancies: cuts have extended into the consumer retail, media, healthcare and pharmaceutical spaces.\n\nHistorically, layoffs have been part of the natural cycles of a necessarily ebbing and flowing economy. Yet experts say this wave is notable for several reasons.\n\nThe first: their scope and scale, especially in light of the fact that the underlying economic fundamentals are showing improvement. During the global Great Recession, by contrast, hundreds of thousands of jobs were cut but as a direct reaction to a massive slump in the value of assets around the globe, upending livelihoods and wiping trillions of dollars off the value of international stock markets for a sustained period. But that\u2019s not the case now, even as layoffs and job insecurity proliferate.\n\nIn the US, for instance, the 2008 financial crisis and following recession saw the unemployment rate peak at 10%, with some 15 million people registered as unemployed due to a systemic and protracted slowdown in economic activity. Today, the unemployment rate is around 3.5%. During the 2011 eurozone crisis, unemployment in the European Union surpassed 11.5%, compared to a current rate of below 6.5%.\n\nA second reason the redundancies are noteworthy is because of the current atmosphere of the workplace itself. During the pandemic, managers championed an employee-centric style of leadership that prioritised personal wellbeing and mental health, explains Anna Tavis, a professor of human capital management at New York University. \u201cWe were encouraged to bring our whole selves to work,\u201d she says.\n\nI\u2019m basically 100% sure that one of these days, I\u2019ll get the email saying that my position\u2019s been eliminated \u2026 It\u2019s just a matter of time \u2013 Kara\n\nAs a result, many workers are feeling a sense of cognitive dissonance \u2013 both those laid off, and others like Kara, who live in fear of being axed next. Tavis explains that during Covid-19, they were told one thing \u2013 but now they\u2019re experiencing something that discredits that narrative. \u201cIt\u2019s making leadership seem inauthentic, and that\u2019s understandably having an impact on employee trust in leadership,\u201d she says.\n\nSome experts warn that if waves of layoffs like the ones we\u2019ve recently seen \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 or even just the looming possibility of such cuts \u00ad\u2013 continue to be part of working life, organisational cultures could also deteriorate, having a grim ripple effect on everything from employee engagement and productivity, to physical and mental health. And what\u2019s worse, these conditions could touch generations to come.\n\nA human toll\n\nNotably, job cuts can have an immediate effect on wellness: a wealth of research shows that being laid off increases the risk of a host of health conditions.\n\nOne of the most comprehensive summaries of more than 300 studies on this subject shows that unemployed people are more distressed; less satisfied with their lives, marriages and families; and more likely to report psychological problems than the employed. Being made redundant has been linked to a much higher risk of suicide and higher rates of mortality more generally in the decades after being cut.\n\nSeparate research from 2009 shows that, for employees with no pre-existing health conditions, the likelihood of developing a health condition increases by 83% in the first 15 to 18 months after a layoff, with the most common conditions being stress-related illnesses, including hypertension, heart disease and arthritis.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only the laid-off workers who stand to suffer in a layoff economy. As workers like Kara know, even before any cuts have been announced, the possibility and fear of being made redundant can also have a bearing on mental health and productivity. Writing in Harvard Business Review, executive coach and author Melody Wilding, explains that job insecurity can erode motivation and lead to mental-health issues, such as anxiety and depression.\n\nMixed messages about employee-wellness prioritisation have also been unsettling to workers, often to detrimental effect.\n\nDuring the pandemic, employees demonstrated a shift in their priorities and a change in their professional ambitions. Importantly, they started investing more in their mental health. Employers, in many cases, recognised these calls for better support; many leaders opened conversations about introducing policies, programmes and tools to help struggling employees.\n\nGetty Images Experts say that even the looming prospect of layoffs can affect mental health and job performance (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nCorporate dialogue also opened around establishing at a future in which terms like burnout, stress and depression would no longer be associated with weakness, and carry the burden of stigma in the workplace. For younger workers who have entered the labour market for the first time during the past few years, the employee-centric company that purportedly champions mental health and wellbeing might be the only impression they\u2019ve ever had of the working world.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this emphasis on personal wellness serves in stark contrast to the reality many workers are living now. Data shows precarity of the current labour market is eroding their wellbeing: a recent global survey of 35,000 workers showed that some 52% of respondents are worried about the impact of economic uncertainty on their job security, and that more than a third are explicitly concerned about losing their job.\n\nIndeed, research by Maureen Dollard, a professor of work and organisational psychology at the University of South Australia, shows that employees in less psychologically healthy environments \u2013 which she defines as environments in which emotional wellbeing is not ignored \u2013 took 43% more sick days per month. Her research has also shown that stress can increase the risk of sustaining injuries at work.\n\nOther experts, like Bentley University professor of management and psychology Aaron Nurick, emphasise that layoffs can also impact those who don\u2019t lose their jobs in the form of what he describes as \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt\u201d \u2013 a sense of \u201cI might be next\u201d.\n\nAnthony Klotz, associate professor at University College London\u2019s School of Management, echoes this. He says that, at least temporarily, \u201clayoffs make the work experience less pleasant for those who remain, and it\u2019s not hard to imagine that these negative effects are lasting in many cases\u201d.\n\nLasting effects\n\nNot only have these cuts chipped away at the mental health of people in the workforce, but they also may be changing employees\u2019 behaviour \u2013 even stunting their career development and relationships to work overall.\n\nFor instance, writes Wilding: \u201cIf you feel helpless in the face of upheaval at your company, you may retreat and pull back on your efforts, which renders you a more likely candidate for cuts.\u201d\n\nEmployees who were told during the pandemic that their organisations were employee-centric and cared about their wellbeing simply don\u2019t want to work for people who they feel they can\u2019t trust \u2013 Anna Tavis\n\nAdditionally, in this environment, writes Bentley\u2019s Nurick, \u201c[people] may be more careful about what they say and do. Employees don\u2019t want to be noticed, because that makes them more vulnerable. It\u2019s like animals in the wild \u2013 they\u2019ll do whatever it takes to camouflage themselves and fit in. It\u2019s an element of basic survival.\u201d Dollard\u2019s research also shows that these employees were significantly less productive at work.\n\nJob insecurity might also lead to behaviours like quiet quitting \u2013 doing the bare minimum required to stay in a job. \u201cEmployees who were told during the pandemic that their organisations were employee-centric and cared about their wellbeing simply don\u2019t want to work for people who they feel they can\u2019t trust,\u201d explains Tavis. \u201cThey\u2019re angry.\u201d\n\nCreativity can be a cost of layoffs, too. \u201cRemaining employees are more careful and cautious, which means they don\u2019t engage in behaviour that could result in innovation,\u201d writes Nurick. \u201cNo one seems to want to fail.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Klotz points to research showing that employees who are laid off are much more likely to voluntarily quit jobs in the future, relative to those who have never experienced a layoff. \u201cOne might think that the harmful effects that layoffs have on laid off employees\u2019 trust is limited to the company that laid them off,\u201d says Klotz. \u201cBut this research suggests that being laid off makes it more difficult to build strong bonds with future employers as well.\u201d\n\nFor workers who are not laid off but fear that they might be, Klotz \u2013 who is credited with coining the term \u2018Great Resignation\u2019 in 2021 \u2013 says that a common response to feelings of job insecurity is to start searching for other jobs.\n\n\u201cLoyalty comes from reciprocal loyal treatment between companies and employees. Typically, feelings of loyalty would act as a force that keeps employees from seriously entertaining outside job offers,\u201d says Klotz. \u201cBut in the wake of layoffs, remaining employees are less likely to feel a sense of loyalty, given that the company has just shown its willingness to unilaterally break ties with sometimes thousands of workers.\u201d"
