        "content": "XRP News: The legal tussle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple has hindered the XRP price growth over time. The recent developments in the Ripple lawsuit may have led XRP to print green indexes in the last 90 days but experts believe that the fair market valuation of the token is still quite low.\n\nWill XRP Price Surge After US SEC Lawsuit Ends?\n\nResearch done by Jimmy Vallee and Molly Elmore of Valhil Capital concluded the fair market value of XRP after facing a two year long running U.S. SEC lawsuit. The report suggested that XRP\u2019s fair value ranges from $3.5K to a whopping $22K.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt mentioned that in order to check the harm caused due to the U.S. SEC lawsuit on XRP price, they invited a large group of people to form a confidential committee. The team members were well experienced in quantitative and financial valuations.\n\nThe confidential committee built six different valuation models in the process. The research is based on 99-Year Golden Eagle Model, Discounted Cash Flow Model, Pipeline Flow Model, Athey and Mitchnick Model, Collateralization Model and Quantum Liquidity Model.\n\nThe variables considered during the research are Global transaction volume, discount rate, daily transaction value, tokens circulation, projected economic growth and more.\n\nXRP Price Up By 42% In 90 Days\n\nKeeping six quantitive models together suggested median fair market value per XRP is around $12,822. At the same time, the mean value came out to be $61, 231 per XRP. However, the research concluded that the current XRP fair market value ranges from $3.5K to $22k.\n\nHowever, XRP is trading at an average price of $0.52, at the press time. XRP price surged by a whopping 42% in the last 90 days. Ripple\u2019s native crypto is the biggest gainer outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) among the top 10 cryptos over this period."

        "content": "In the Earth Day match against the Seattle Sounders, MNUFC wore One Planet jerseys made out of 100% recycled plastic. The jerseys themselves help reduce plastic waste, and to take it a step further, MNUFC held a One Planet Jersey Auction in which game-worn jerseys from M\u00e9nder Garc\u00eda, Zarek Valentin, Hassani Dotson, and Robin Lod were sold to the highest bidder. The proceeds benefited Mississippi Park Connection , an incredible group that protects, connects, promotes, and advocates for the mighty Mississippi that runs through our cities.\n\nThe month of May was a busy time for the Community Relations team at Minnesota United. From school visits to community clinics, MNUFC worked hard to create a positive impact in multiple Twin Cities neighborhoods. In celebration of those endeavors, we\u2019ve compiled a list of some of our favorite events over this past month.\n\nFutsal Blue Cross Blue Shield Community Clinic\n\nOn Friday, May 5, MNUFC hosted its first Blue Cross Blue Shield community clinic of the year with Futsal Society. Futsal Society is a wonderful local program that provides a free soccer alternative to kids who cannot \u201cpay to play.\u201d The evening was filled with top-notch talent, laughs, games, drills, and even a DJ! MNUFC players Diogo Pacheco, Carlos Leatherman, Mikael Marques, and Britton Fischer helped to support the young players through the warmups and drills.\n\nWalk for Animals\n\nThe Animal Humane Society hosted its 52nd annual Walk for Animals fundraiser on May 6. The fun festival and pet parade brought Minnesotans together for an incredible day of celebrating their own furry friends while supporting the vulnerable and homeless animals who need help. There were food trucks, pet vendors, and adorable animals as far as the eye could see. MNUFC and PK showed full support by mingling, meeting, and greeting attendees.\n\nUnified Tryouts:\n\nThe Month of May also meant an expansion of the Unified team, presented by Allina Health! Tryouts were held on May 9, at the National Sports Center in Blaine, where the athletes and their partners from Special Olympics Minnesota brought their talent and energy. MNUFC2 coaches Cameron Knowles and Jeremy Hall, as well as MNUFC2 players Carlos Leatherman, Diogo Pacheco and Britton Fischer came to support the SOMN coaches with warmups, drills and scouting."

        "title": "Ripple v. SEC: The Case So Far and What\u2019s Next for the XRP Price? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "During the winter of 2020, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission fired the first bullet in what would eventually become a dragged-out legal battle against the entire cryptocurrency industry.\n\nOn December 22nd, 2020, the SEC charged Ripple with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered security offering, essentially alleging that their native cryptocurrency \u2013 XRP \u2013 is a security.\n\nTwo and a half years later, the battle is still raging on, but the proportions are now tremendously larger. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nRipple v. SEC: Clash of Titans\n\nThe SEC under the regimen of Gary Gensler has turned into an anti-crypto establishment, and no one is trying to even hide it. We just didn\u2019t know all that back in 2020 when one of the first shots was fired.\n\nIn December 2020, the SEC alleged that XRP is a security and that Ripple has conducted an unregistered $1.3 billion security offering. Back then, the Director of the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division, Stephanie Avakian, said:\n\nWe allege that Ripple, Larsen, and Garlinghouse failed to register their ongoing offer and sale of billions of XRP to retail investors, which deprived potential purchasers of adequate disclosures about XRP and Ripple\u2019s business and other important long-standing protections that are fundamental to our robust public market system.\n\nRipple\u2019s entire defense is based on its claim that XRP is a currency and not a security. Nonetheless, back then, its price cratered as more and more exchanges started to delist XRP in fear of the SEC.\n\nCoinbase stood behind Ripple publicly, filing an amicus brief, also known as \u201cfriend of the court\u201d in support of the company\u2019s ongoing case.\n\nAn Ongoing Battle\n\nMany months have passed since, and it\u2019s doubtful that anyone had hopes of quick resolutions, as both sides show no signs of stepping back.\n\nA cornerstone of Ripple\u2019s defense is the so-called Hinman Speech.\n\nWilliam Hinman is a former director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance. The speech in question refers to an occasion when he indicated that the agency didn\u2019t consider ETH security at the time.\n\nRipple lawyers have fought to find out more about how Hinman came to that conclusion in hopes it could impact XRP\u2019s classification as well. In October 2022, they managed to obtain the documents \u2013 it took them roughly 18 months to do so. Ripple fought off multiple objections on behalf of the SEC, the latest one of which demanded the court to seal Hinman\u2019s Speech but was denied by Judge Analisa Torres.\n\nThis has seemingly tipped the scales in Ripple\u2019s favor \u2013 something that already seems to be priced in XRP\u2019s performance, as investors are turning bullish on a favorable court decision.\n\nThe SEC seems to be under tension, and it shows. As we reported just a few days ago, the Commission seems to have deleted Hinman\u2019s biography from its website. It\u2019s worth noting that the SEC has until June 13th to hand over unredacted emails of Hinman\u2019s internal communications \u2013 a deadline that many are looking forward to.\n\nWhat of XRP\u2019s Price?\n\nRipple isn\u2019t the only company under siege. The SEC just pressed charges against both Coinbase and Binance \u2013 the two leading cryptocurrency exchanges. They allege that the companies have been violating securities laws, among other things (for Binance).\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that XRP wasn\u2019t named a security by the SEC in a non-exhaustive list of 13 \u201cCrypto Asset Securities\u201d in the filing against Coinbase.\n\nIt feels as if the entire industry is under fire. And yet, XRP\u2019s price remains resilient. Over the past seven days, it\u2019s remained the only altcoin from the majors that\u2019s still in the green, albeit by a very slight margin.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a big deadline coming on June 13th \u2013 as mentioned above. The outcome of the session will likely have an impact on XRP\u2019s price, and it\u2019s very exciting to see exactly what.\n\nIn any case, investors seem to be pricing in a positive outcome as XRP has added more than 23% to its price in the past 30 days alone."

        "content": "Pictured is the gated entrance to the 800-plus acre Aspen Valley Ranch, which is the subject of a foreclosure action being initiated in Pitkin County by a group of lenders. CREDIT: Andre Salvail/Aspen Daily News. Credit: Andre Salvail/Aspen Daily News\n\nSince our last edition of The Roundup last week, we\u2019ve published three stories at Aspen Journalism.\n\nIncluded in the mix is the debut of a new reporting partnership with longtime local journalist Rick Carroll, now the managing editor of Aspen Daily News, who\u2019s working with Aspen Journalism on a freelance basis. The idea is that about once a month, we\u2019ll publish a deeper dive into a topic on his radar than he typically wouldn\u2019t be able to get to as part of his daily duties. His first effort fits the bill, as he unpacked the public record on file with New York state courts involving a lender\u2019s dispute with an Aspen business group led by a local family, which has ensnared multiple downtown Aspen properties and a local real estate brokerage. Representatives of the family are fighting in New York courts to prevent an auction of their Aspen assets, which could negatively impact hundreds of people whose employment is tied to the Souki family\u2019s Ajax Holdings.\n\nAlso this week, Water Desk Editor Heather Sackett took us inside an effort to get a number of local creek segments designated under the state\u2019s Outstanding Waters program \u2014 a status reserved for bodies of water with extremely high water-quality and scenic attributes. While the program is little known among the general public, and the protections it offers appear to be mostly untested, advocates see attaining the status as a valuable tool to protect against future, perhaps as-yet-unknown, threats. And who would disagree that the reaches up for consideration along Woody, Hunter, Avalanche and Middle Thompson creeks \u2014 all which will require a series of public hearings convened by the state health department \u2014 are indeed outstanding?\n\nFinally, Data Editor Laurine Lassalle brought us a check in on the state of local soil-moisture levels, a data point that we have become increasingly familiar with in recent years, as the lack of it has helped fuel decreased streamflows and wildfire. As Lassalle explains, the primary driver of soil-moisture conditions in the spring and going forward is how saturated the ground is in early winter \u2014 conditions that help set up how much snowmelt will reach rivers and streams. This year, based on those November and December 2022 conditions, soil moisture as measured by a network of monitoring stations throughout the Roaring Fork basin is reading at moderate levels. Compared to a runoff year like 2021, when a dry fall in 2020 helped sap the streamflow potential held in the snowpack, that bodes well for the watershed.\n\nThank you for reading, and supporting, our nonprofit, investigative newsroom, making this work possible and keeping reporters on the beat.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\n\u2013 Curtis Wackerle\n\nEditor and executive director\n\nCredit: Rick Carroll/Aspen Journalism\n\nAspen Valley Ranch also facing foreclosure in legal battle playing out in Colorado, New York courts\n\nBy Rick Carroll | June 5, 2023\n\nThe assets owned by Ajax Holdings, which is controlled by the Souki family and affiliates, also are on the line. The lenders have hired Dallas-based commercial property firm CBRE to solicit bidders and administer a public auction set for the end of the month, according to court records.\n\nContinue reading\u2026\n\nCredit: Heather Sackett/Aspen Journalism\n\nWater samples collected on upper reaches of Woody, Hunter, Avalanche and Thompson creeks\n\nBy Heather Sackett | June 7, 2023\n\nThe Outstanding Waters designation can be awarded to streams with high water quality and exceptional recreational or ecological attributes, and the intent is to protect the water quality from future degradation.\n\nContinue reading\u2026\n\nCredit: Elizabeth Stewart-Severy/Aspen Journalism\n\nSpring runoff influenced by last fall\u2019s turf conditions\n\nBy Laurine Lassalle | June 2, 2023\n\nLooking across the Roaring Fork Basin, soil moisture on Nov. 2, 2022, measured 70% of average for the higher elevations sites and 100% of average at lower elevations.
