        "title": "Ipswich town centre murder: 'The ripple effect is absolutely catastrophic' - BBC",
        "content": "Westgate Street, a pedestrianised shopping street in Ipswich town centre, became a crime scene after Tuesday's \"targeted\" attack.\n\nA Section 60 order, which ran for three 24-hour periods, gave officers additional powers to stop and search and a mobile police station on Cornhill will be manned into the early hours.\n\nPolice said they were conducting numerous inquiries, including forensic work, searches and CCTV analysis.\n\n\"It came as devastating news for the town and for us,\" Supt Andy Martin told the BBC.\n\n\"A lot of the officers that you see out and about in Ipswich live here and have grown up here, they feel the same sense of loss the community does.\n\n\"[This] is not something in my memory that has happened so brazenly in Ipswich, and naturally that is going to come with a huge sense of loss and how people feel going into town.\"\n\nHe said the circumstances of the incident, witnessed by many people outside Marks and Spencer and Primark at 15:35 GMT, would obviously have an immediate effect on the town centre.\n\n\"It would be remiss of me not to expect a reduction in footfall in the town after an incident like this,\" he added.\n\n\"People are naturally nervous in wanting to go into the town, so it's going to have a short-term impact.\n\n\"We're going to be working really closely with our partners to ensure the reputation is what it deserves - it is a safe place to go, it is a vibrant place to go.\n\n\"It's just a regrettable set of circumstances.\""

        "content": "Ripple, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency, has been in a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over whether XRP should be considered a security or a commodity. In a recent interview with C, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz explained why XRP is a commodity.\n\nSchwartz explained that XRP is similar to other commodities in that it is a digital asset that is used as a medium of exchange. He stated that XRP is similar to gold, which is also a medium of exchange and a store of value. He also highlighted that XRP is not tied to any company or organization, and that its value is determined by market forces.\n\nXRP is a raw good that trades in commerce and one XRP is treated as equivalent to every other XRP. That's pretty much the definition of a \"commodity\". No part of XRP's value comes from anyone else's legal obligations to XRP holders. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 20, 2023\n\nSchwartz also explained that XRP is used to facilitate international money transfers, and that it is used as a bridge currency to facilitate cross-border transactions. He stated that XRP is used to reduce the cost and increase the speed of these transactions, which makes it similar to other commodities used in international trade, such as oil.\n\nThe SEC has alleged that XRP is a security and that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering of XRP worth $1.3 billion. Ripple and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen have denied the allegations and are fighting the case in court.\n\nBottom Line: Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz explained why XRP is a commodity and not a security.

        "title": "Ripple effect of Rakuten Mobile embezzlement case threatens subcontractors' survival - The Mainichi - The Mainichi",
        "content": "The Rakuten logo is seen in this photo taken on June 11, 2019. (Mainichi)\n\nTOKYO -- A suspected case of embezzlement by a Rakuten Mobile Inc. employee and figures at a pair of the mobile giant's business partners is threatening the survival of those partners' subcontractors, triggering layoffs and unpaid wages.\n\nRakuten Mobile announced on Sept. 2, 2022 that it had fired the employee involved in the case. According to sources close to the matter, the employee is believed to have colluded with executives and other figures at business partners Nippon Logistech Corp., based in Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward, and Trail, based in the capital's Minato Ward, to pad their bills with fake consulting fees and other costs. Damages are said to total 4.6 billion yen, or around $35.5 million. After the employee's illicit actions came to light, Rakuten suspended transactions with the two companies, and an application to the court for the provisional seizure of their savings was recognized. The fallout was swift and sharp.\n\nOn Aug. 31, two days before a wave of layoff notices, supervisors and prime contractors began telling their workers and subcontractors all over Japan -- at mobile phone base station construction sites, at component warehouses, and other places besides -- that \"there will be no work starting tomorrow,\" and \"Our contract was terminated by Rakuten Mobile.\"\n\nRakuten had hired Nippon Logistech Corp. to manage and transport components for putting up base stations, and Rakuten orders accounted for over half of its revenue. The company had no choice but to apply for bankruptcy procedures under the Civil Rehabilitation Act shortly after its bank account was seized by court order. Building Rakuten base stations also comprised a hefty portion of Trail's business, and the firm had to suspend operations when the mobile giant cut them off. As a result, the many subcontractors under these two companies have been driven toward the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nShinwa, based in Fukuoka Prefecture, is one of them. It had been contracted by Trail to build base stations for the entire Kyushu region, but in late August 2022 a Trail employee suddenly ordered it to \"stop construction and immediately leave the sites.\" Trail told the subcontractor that it could not make a payment of some 140 million yen, or around $1.08 million, for work already completed, because its bank account had been seized.\n\nIts component supplies are up in the air and its staff have been left hanging, as funds have been depleted by payments to business partners. Shinwa has had to lay off around 30 people. Shintaro Tsutsumi, the company's 42-year-old president, has asked Trail and Rakuten itself for relief many times, but says he's got no response.\n\nThis past December, Shinwa filed a lawsuit against Trail, demanding payment of the unpaid 140 million yen. Tsutsumi declared angrily, \"Why do subcontractors have to pay for the illicit actions of a Rakuten employee?\"\n\nImax, subcontracted by Nippon Logistech via Trail to manage and transport components, also fell victim to the Rakuten worker's suspected embezzlement. The Sagamihara, Kanagawa Prefecture-based firm went bankrupt at the end of 2022, apparently costing some 500 employees across Japan their jobs. Many of them are still waiting for unpaid salaries and compensation for loss of earnings, and some have applied for relief with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Labor Relations Commission.\n\nA 51-year-old woman and former Imax contract worker from Chiba Prefecture has not yet received her salary of around 200,000 yen (about $1,500) for August 2022. Though she has been searching for a new job since September, when she was dismissed, she has not found one, and is seeking relief measures. She commented, \"Rakuten also has responsibility, for allowing such careless transactions.\"\n\nHideki Mizuno, a lawyer familiar with labor issues, said, \"Terminating a contract with a business partner due to suspicions of illicit activity cannot be helped, but in terms of the moral responsibility of a major firm, Rakuten could at least take measures like directly commissioning subcontractors to do work so that they're not forced into bankruptcy.\"\n\nIn response to a Mainichi Shimbun inquiry, Rakuten commented, \"We are not in a position to respond, or be involved with businesses which were entrusted with tasks by our business partners.\"\n\n(Japanese original by Nana Hayashida and Ryo Endo, Tokyo City News Department)"

        "title": "Stellar Blockchain: Overview, History, FAQ - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Stellar Blockchain?\n\nThe Stellar blockchain is one of the hundreds of networks that store and transmit cryptocurrencies. As bitcoin garnered headlines over the past ten years, many other virtual currencies and platforms racked up impressive gains and user bases. The stellar blockchain, with its lumens token, is one of them.\n\nIn early 2021, the value of Stellar's lumen token grew more than fivefold, from $0.13 to $0.73, before collapsing over the following year. As of early 2023, the lumen token is trading for about $0.08, according to the crypto data site CoinMarketCap.\n\nKey Takeaways The Stellar blockchain is a distributed ledger used to transmit digital currencies.\n\nThe main token of the Stellar blockchain is Stellar lumens or XLM.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain uses a consensus algorithm that is faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than that of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain was launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, who also founded Mt. Gox and co-founded Ripple.\n\nCritics say that the Stellar blockchain is centralized around the Stellar Development Foundation, which controls a large share of the lumens tokens.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Stellar Blockchain\n\nStellar's basic operation is similar to that of most decentralized payment technologies. It runs a network of decentralized servers with a distributed ledger that is updated every two to five seconds among all nodes. The most prominent distinguishing factor between Stellar and bitcoin is its consensus protocol.\n\n\n\nStellar\u2019s consensus protocol does not rely on the entire miner network to approve transactions. Instead, it uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) algorithm, which enables faster processing of transactions. This is because it uses quorum slices (or a portion of the network) to approve and validate a transaction.\n\nEach node in the Stellar network chooses another set of \u201ctrustworthy\u201d nodes. Once a transaction is approved by all nodes within this set, then it is considered approved. The shortened process has made Stellar's network extremely fast and it is said to process as many as 1,000 network operations per second.\n\nHow the Stellar Blockchain Process Works\n\nThe current process for cross-border transfers is a complicated one. It requires domestic banks to maintain accounts in foreign jurisdictions in local currencies. Their correspondent banks must operate a similar account in the original country.\n\nThe Nostro-Vostro process, as it is known, for cross-border transactions with fiat currencies is a lengthy one involving conversion and reconciliation of accounts. Because it enables simultaneous validation, Stellar\u2019s blockchain can shorten or eliminate the delays and complexity involved.\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumens cryptocurrency can also be used to provide liquidity and streamline the process. According to some reports, banks will use their own cryptocurrencies to facilitate such transfers in the future. According to David Mazi\u00e8res, a Stanford University professor and SCP creator, the protocol has \u201cmodest\u201d computing and financial requirements. This enables even organizations with minimal IT budgets, such as nonprofits, to participate in its network.\n\nHistory of Stellar Blockchain\n\nStellar was launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb (pictured), who also co-founded the cryptocurrency company Ripple and the exchange Mt. Gox. After leaving Ripple over his differences with other co-founders, McCaleb and his partner Joyce Kim launched the Stellar protocol as a fork of the Ripple codebase. Payments company Stripe provided $3 million in seed funding.\n\nStellar came into the spotlight in October 2017 after it announced a partnership with IBM. The partnership envisages the setting up of multiple currency corridors among nations in the South Pacific.\n\nThe project stated a goal of processing up to 60% of all cross-border payments in the region, which includes countries like Australia, Fiji, and Tonga. This would enable connections between small businesses, non-profits, and local banking institutions to expedite commercial transactions. For example, a farmer in Samoa would be able to connect and conduct transactions with a buyer in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2016, prominent technology consulting firm Deloitte also announced a partnership with Stellar to develop a payments app. At a conference in 2017, McCaleb confirmed that 30 banks signed up to use Stellar\u2019s blockchain for cross-border transfers.\n\nEach Stellar wallet must maintain a minimum balance in order to exist. At present, each account must maintain a base reserve of 1 XLM.\n\nConcerns About Stellar Blockchain\n\nFollowing the launch of the Stellar protocol, many investors raised alarms about the high number of lumens tokens controlled by the Stellar Development Foundation. Rather than let Stellar nodes \"mine\" new cryptocurrency, the creators of Stellar simply created 100 billion lumens tokens. The vast majority of them were assigned to the Stellar Development Foundation.\n\nAlthough these resources are ostensibly intended to fund development and adoption, some investors worry that they could be sold on the market, thereby diluting the holdings of potential investors. In order to address these concerns, the SDF intentionally destroyed 55 billion lumens tokens in 2019.\n\nThere are also concerns that the network relies on a small number of nodes, many of them controlled by the SDF. In 2019, two of those nodes unexpectedly failed, causing the Stellar blockchain to halt for over an hour.\n\nStellar Blockchain vs. Ripple\n\nStellar is an open-source payment technology that shares several similarities with Ripple and its XRP cryptocurrency. Like Ripple, Stellar is a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers.\n\nBoth networks use similar protocols and were derived from the same codebase. In both protocols, there is no mining or algorithmic proof-of-work: All tokens were created at the moment the blockchain was launched.\n\nThe majority of XRP tokens are controlled by Ripple, a for-profit company, while the majority of lumens tokens are held by the nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation. While Ripple is a closed system, Stellar is open-source.\n\n\n\nThey also have different customers. Ripple works with established banking institutions and consortiums in order to streamline their cross-border transfer technology. In contrast, Stellar is focused on developing markets and has multiple use cases for its technology, including money remittances and bank loan distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is XLM Crypto? XLM, or Stellar lumens, is the native cryptocurrency of the stellar blockchain and it is used to pay transaction fees. However, it is not the only cryptocurrency on the Stellar blockchain, which can be used to move tokens representing anything from commodities to fiat currencies.\n\nHow Do I Check the Blockchain for a Stellar Transaction? You can check a stellar transaction on a stellar-focused block explorer. These are online tools that allow users to view recent transactions, blocks, and account balances. Popular Stellar explorers include Stellarchain.io, Blockchair.com, and StellarExpert.\n\nHow Does Stellar Blockchain Work? The Stellar blockchain uses a proof-of-agreement consensus algorithm to ensure coordination between different nodes. These nodes broadcast transactions to one another every five seconds, ensuring that they are all keeping identical versions of the Stellar ledger.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Stellar blockchain is one of the thousands of competitors to Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is used for fast, cheap transactions with minimal computational or energy costs. Although it has occasionally enjoyed sharp price rises, the value of Stellar lumens has plunged with respect to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.
