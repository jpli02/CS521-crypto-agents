        "title": "'If Anyone Attacks Me...' Kerala Muslim Couple's Remarriage after 29 Years Creates Ripples in Community - News18",
        "content": "Even as a debate rages over a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in the country, a Kerala Muslim couple in their early fifties entered into a marriage contract on March 8 in Kasargod, the northernmost district of the state. The act may have far-reaching consequences in their community, more so than their personal lives, as it has triggered a discussion on International Women\u2019s Day about \u201cgender disparity that prevents Muslim girls from inheriting their parents\u2019 assets\u201d.\n\nThe couple remarried under the Special Marriage Act, with their three daughters witnessing it. Advocate C Shukkur, 53, known as Shukkur Vakkeel, is a lawyer by profession and a former government pleader. He acted in the 2022 film \u2018Nna Thaan Case Kodu\u2019 (Sue Me) as an advocate and his namesake. Dr Sheena Shukkur, 51, was the first woman to become a Pro Vice Chancellor (PVC) and one of the youngest in Kerala to hold the post in the state when she joined Kottayam-based MG University (MGU) in 2013.\n\nThough they were the same people, there was a contrast between the first and second marriages. The first one at Cheruvathoor on October 6, 1994, solemnised by then Muslim League supremo Panakkad Syed Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal was a \u201cNikah\u201d, under \u201cSharia\u201d, the Islamic legal system, while the second at the Hosdurg sub-registrar office situated at Kanhangad was a registered marriage under the Special Marriage Act passed by Parliament in 1954.\n\nThe couple decided to remarry to overcome the legal hurdle of inheritance to three daughters as they have no male progeny. Advocate Shukkur had given 30 days\u2019 notice, which is mandatory for marriages under the Special Marriage Act, on February 3.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t my (our) life savings go to my three children? What is the doubt? They have to get it. But will they get it? What a question! No, that\u2019s it,\u201d stated Shukkur on Facebook while announcing his plan for the second marriage.\n\nThe reason is The Muslim Personal Law (Sharia) Application Act of 1937, he said. \u201cAccording to this law, the law of Muslim succession in India is Muslim Personal Law or Sharia. This 1937 law does not say anything about what Sharia is. But according to the approach taken by our courts based on the book Principles of Mahomedan Law written by Sir Dinshaw Fardunji Mulla in 1906, only two-thirds of my/our property will be given to our children after our death. The remaining share belongs to our brothers,\u201d he said.\n\nAs per Article 14 of the Constitution, everyone has equal rights, irrespective of religion, caste, or gender, said Shukkur. \u201cRegrettably, this right is denied to the daughters of a practising Muslim,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Special Marriage Act says that the succession to the property of any person solemnised under it will be governed by the Indian Succession Act.\n\nHowever, the remarriage has created a storm in the community with fierce criticism from many major organisations.\n\nThe Malappuram-based Council for Fatwa and Research of the Darul Huda Islamic University has termed the act \u201canti-Islamic with a selfish motive\u201d. \u201cVakkeel is trying to bypass Islamic law which permits brothers to inherit one-third of the assets of parents without male progeny. We will \u2018defend\u2019 the moves to mock the rules of the religion and demoralise the believers,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe Mujahid Girls and Women (MGM) group said the couple were \u201ctools in the hands of anti-Muslim forces\u201d. \u201cThe inheritance laws of Islam are valid through all ages. Those who doubt it are either those who refuse to accept the divine law or those who may think of loss while following the same. The people will realise the ridiculous situation of those who are married under Islamic law entering a registered marriage. The community must identify those who seek attention through these kinds of gimmicks while the UCC is a threat in the country. The anti-Islamists disguised as the reformists must stop paving the red carpet to UCC,\u201d said a statement issued after a state-level meeting of MGM.\n\nHowever, Shukkur responded that if he were attacked, the responsibility would be on those who made the call for \u201cdefence\u201d against him. \u201cI did not disrespect the religious rules or weaken the spirit of the believer,\u201d he said.\n\nShukkur said there was no need for \u201cdefence\u201d against him. \u201cIf anyone dares to attack me sportingly by using the word \u2018defence\u2019 wrongly, the people who issued this statement will be fully responsible,\u201d he posted on Facebook.\n\nEarlier in 2015, Sheena Shukkur sparked a controversy by claiming that she and her spouse \u201cgot a government bungalow and car for standing under the green flag of the Muslim League\u201d.\n\nSheena Shukkur made these remarks while inaugurating a family meet organised by Cheruvathoor Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre (KMCC) affiliated with the Muslim League in Dubai when she was the PVC.\n\nThe then governor P Sathasivam, in his capacity as chancellor of the university, had asked then MGU vice chancellor Babu Sebastian to conduct an inquiry into the allegations against Sheena Shukkur for attending the meeting of a political organisation outside the country without prior permission.\n\nHer husband was appointed as a government pleader after the Congress and Muslim League came to power.\n\nRead all the Latest India News here"
