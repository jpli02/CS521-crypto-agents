        "content": "XRP is positioned to handle 3,400 transactions every second, leading to 293 million per day.\n\nExperts note that this impressive number is theoretical and, in practical scenarios, the speed might vary.\n\nDrawing from a tweet by Alex Cobb, XRP demonstrates an astounding ability to manage 3,400 transactions each second. This translates to 204,000 transactions a minute and a jaw-dropping 12.24 million transactions hourly. Within a 24-hour span, this culminates in an outstanding 293 million transactions. Referring back to the tweet by Alex Cobb, he emphasizes,\n\nXRP can handle 3,400 Transactions per second That's:\n\n204,000 per minute\n\n12.24 Million per hour\n\n293 Million per day XRP is truly designed to be a global utility asset for banks all around the\ud83c\udf0e \u2014 Alex Cobb (@AlexCobb_) October 3, 2023\n\nThese impressive statistics are not just numbers but underscore XRP\u2019s potential as a significant utility asset for the worldwide banking domain. With such potential, financial institutions might see XRP as a promising choice when they consider integrating blockchain technology into their operations. The transactional prowess of XRP has even humorously been compared to legendary sprinter Usain Bolt in the community.\n\nThe Real-world XRP Performance Debate\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with the sheer scalability highlighted. Daniel Keller, an XRPL ambassador and CTO at Eminence, provides a contrasting perspective. He suggests that the 3,400 TPS is more of a theoretical figure achieved under controlled, perfect conditions. In the chaotic, unpredictable environment of the real world, XRP might not always reach these numbers. Drawing from hands-on experience and data, Keller mentions that XRP\u2019s realistic transaction speed oscillates between 500 to 700 TPS. Additionally, Ripple\u2019s own CTO recently aligned with this view, confirming that while the XRP team had previously advertised a capability of 1,500 TPS, the recent upgrade to 3,400 TPS remains an aspirational figure.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market is waiting for the official closure of the legal battle between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple, those close to the case have weighed in on the latest court decision denying the regulator\u2019s request for an early appeal.\n\nSpecifically, lawyer Bill Morgan argued that the SEC had \u201clost big\u201d and kept making its job more difficult for itself in other cases, especially against cryptocurrency businesses, by insisting that XRP was a security, in a series of X posts shared on October 4.\n\nSEC\u2019s losing battle\n\nAs Morgan explained:\n\n\u201cThe SEC lost big. It lost on all three elements it neded to satisfy the test for certification for an interlocutory appeal,\u201d as \u201cthe court found 1. there was no controlling question of the law; 2. there was no substantial ground for differences of opinion (\u2026); 3. an interlocutory appeal would not materially advance the ultimate termination of a complete loss by the SEC on every element. Totally smashed.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe SEC certainly is helping to entrench [Judge] Torres\u2019 decision as a precedent for the argument there can be different categories of sales and different classes of the reasonable buyer (institutional buyers v retail buyers through programmatic sales) with different expectations.\u201d\n\nAs the legal expert added:\n\n\u201cThat could make the SEC\u2019s job and evidentiary burden harder in other cases, especially against crypto exchanges. They stuffed up. But you just keep pushing it Gary Gensler and let\u2019s see where it ends.\u201d\n\nThat said, Morgan also pointed out that the SEC had managed to achieve one thing \u2013 \u201cinculcate in probably millions of people in the US and globally in crypto a deep lifelong mistrust and antipathy towards it and belief, rightly or wrongly, it has some corruption. That is some effort.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, regulatory affairs and complex litigation expert and Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty stressed that \u201cthe Court\u2019s July 13 ruling [that retail sales of XRP were not securities sales] was, and remains, the law of the land. XRP is not a security.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the XRP token, which has been the focus of the prolonged court standoff, was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.52, down 0.64% on the day but recording a 2.52% gain across the previous week and a 3.85 % increase in the last 30 days, as per the latest data retrieved by Finbold on October 6.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Founder of Dizer Capital Yasin Mobarak predicts that the SEC will withdraw its charges against Ripple executives.\n\nIn a tweet yesterday, Mobarak predicted that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will withdraw its charges against Ripple executives \u2013 Chris Larsen (chairman) and Brad Garlinghouse (CEO).\n\nSEC v. Ripple Trial\n\nMobarak gave the prediction shortly after Judge Analisa Torres, the judge in charge of the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, announced April 23, 2024, as the date for the upcoming trial. The announcement follows the court\u2019s denial of SEC\u2019s interlocutory appeal request.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFor clarity, the upcoming trial relates to the SEC\u2019s case against Garlinghouse and Larsen. Recall that the SEC filed aiding and abetting charges against Garlinghouse and Larsen as part of its case against Ripple Labs.\n\nThe commission alleged that the execs were reckless in allowing Ripple to distribute XRP as an unregistered security. To resolve the issue, the court has scheduled a trial, which is expected to commence on April 23, 2024.\n\nSEC Will Withdraw Charges Against Ripple Execs\n\nHowever, Dizer Capital\u2019s founder speculates that the SEC will withdraw the charges against Larsen and Garlinghouse. The expert noted that it would not be beneficial for the SEC to go through with a trial that could expose its corruption.\n\nPrediction: The SEC will withdraw charges against @bgarlinghouse and @chrislarsensf . It is not in their interest to have a trial where their corruption can be exposed, not to mention their agenda is far bigger than just these two executives. The longer $XRP solidifies the\u2026 \u2014 Yassin Mobarak ? (@Dizer_YM) October 4, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAdditionally, he said the SEC\u2019s agenda in the lawsuit is bigger than the company\u2019s execs.\n\n\u201cThe longer $XRP solidifies the clarity it has in the marketplace, the more that puts its entire agenda at risk,\u201d he remarked.\n\nAccording to Mobarak, withdrawing the charges against Ripple\u2019s execs will help the SEC to end the case early and file a full appeal to the Second Circuit. This, according to Mobarak, will help the SEC to sustain the cloud of regulatory uncertainty in the industry.\n\nSEC Could Expose Its Hidden Secrets If It Continues to Trial\n\nIt bears mentioning that Mobarak has previously speculated that the trial may not hold. As reported earlier, the expert speculated that the SEC might not proceed with the trial to avoid exposure of its past dealings.\n\nHe made the speculation after Steven Nerayoff highlighted SEC\u2019s engagement with Ethereum, especially during the early sales of ETH.\n\nReacting, Mobarak speculated that if the SEC continues with the trial, Ripple could invite Nerayoff to provide further clarity on the allegations.\n\nXRP Community Reacts\n\nMeanwhile, XRP community members have reacted to Mobarak\u2019s recent speculations regarding the SEC v. Ripple trial. Expectedly, several XRP community members have expressed doubts about the possibility of the SEC dropping the charges against Garlinghouse and Larsen.\n\nZero chance of this \u2014 Chris O (@TheOCcryptobro) October 4, 2023\n\nProminent XRP influencer Sherrie is among those who do not think the SEC will withdraw the charges. Commenting on Mobarak\u2019s prediction, Sherrie said she would be surprised to see the SEC drop charges against Garlinghouse and Larsen without receiving incentives from Ripple in return.\n\nTo be honest, I would be surprised if the SEC dropped charges against the individual defendants without some incentive from Ripple given to them. The only types of cases I have heard the SEC withdrawing are violations made by data protections that were meant to be in place. \u2014 Sherrie ? (@CherryEmpress21) October 4, 2023"

        "title": "Can Blockchain Deliver Speed, Security and Inclusion to Global Payments? - PYMNTS.com",
        "content": "Innovative technology is on the cusp of transforming existing global payments infrastructure.\n\nBut unlocking the full potential and capturing the true impact of next-generation value transfer solutions like blockchain-based payment technology will require a winning convergence of behavioral trends, regulatory evolutions and technical transformations.\n\nPat Thelen, vice president of global account management at Ripple, and Lina Szaks, senior vice president of global operations at employment platform Multiplier, shared with PYMNTS their thoughts on the innovations that promise to revolutionize both money movement and payments infrastructure around the world.\n\n\u201cThe future is now,\u201d Thelen explained. \u201cInstant and real-time payments are getting faster around the world. Open banking, embedded payments and solutions like buy now, pay later (BNPL) are all things [across the payments landscape] that we are excited about.\u201d\n\nIn a digital-native world, payments infrastructure needs to evolve to cater to the needs of consumers and businesses, and Szaks added that she is tracking the rise of digital wallets and mobile payments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also looking at the expansion of contactless and biometric payments, and growth of peer-to-peer instant payments,\u201d she said. \u201cThe world is going instant everything, and payments are naturally following suit.\u201d\n\nAs the payments ecosystem continues to evolve, the future holds the promise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solutions, enhanced cybersecurity and faster cross-border transactions.\n\nThe Emerging Trends Revolutionizing Today\u2019s Payments Landscape\n\nBlockchain-led innovations around programmability, immutability and global transaction delivery are increasingly pushing the capabilities of the payments industry forward.\n\n\u201cWe see the tokenization of real-world assets as about as exciting as anything out there,\u201d Thelen said. \u201cIf you apply the technology to industries that have been around forever and are fraught with manual processes and illiquidity and latency, there are some real opportunities where so much cost can be taken out of the equation. You can get pretty clever as these use cases unfold.\u201d\n\nHe added that he sees central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) advancing in parallel, noting that over 90% of central banks around the world are looking at what opportunities leveraging the technology could bring them.\n\n\u201cWhat will be interesting is that it will take the commercial banks beneath those central banks to actually make it work, and it will be fun to see those opportunities unfold,\u201d Thelen said.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot to be done around contactless and biometric payments that can ensure they are done accurately, compliantly and in a more instant manner,\u201d Szaks added. \u201cPeople already use Face ID for their phones, and we should go more and more down that path.\u201d\n\nHowever, this potential is still untapped, and the opportunities are still largely uncaptured. But, in the background, the technology to support them is becoming increasingly realized and feasible.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s nice about building a brand-new payment network, like RippleNet, is that you can actually have those standards like ISO 20022 inherent in the technology, which enables you to do some really smart things around risk and compliance, and it opens up the aperture for banks, FinTechs and other providers to do really clever things with the end user in mind,\u201d Thelen explained.\n\nThat is why it is critical for governments, as well as private and commercial institutions, to ensure that their payments infrastructure is fit for purpose going into the next century.\n\nBuilding for the Next Generation of Payments Starts Now\n\n\u201cInnovation is relentless,\u201d Thelen said. \u201cAnd innovation and competition will find a way to apply the technology that is already here. The technology is ready now. You have commercial banks, central banks and institutional players leaning in. Apple, Google, Amazon are certainly leaning in. Look at what is occurring [around blockchain and digital asset solutions] with Visa, Mastercard and PayPal.\u201d\n\nThis innovation in the industry, coupled with the maturation of blockchain technology, is paving the way for a more efficient, inclusive and secure global payments infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThese players understand that if they are going to build for the next generation \u2014 which you don\u2019t have the opportunity to do very often \u2014 that they can not only eliminate the manual, illiquid nature and slow settlement that occurs [across many transactions], but they can also build it in a way that has the end user in mind,\u201d Thelen said.\n\nAs for what he is looking forward to most as progress in payments continues its forward march?\n\n\u201cThe competing demands of innovation in payments have historically centered around trade-offs between things like user privacy and controlling for illicit activity, or speed versus fraud, and when those things have come up against each other, we\u2019ve been forced to choose one,\u201d Thelen said. \u201cWith today\u2019s technology and innovations, those demands are no longer mutually exclusive. They can coexist \u2026 and hopefully there\u2019s an interoperable world where technology is leveraged to take away a lot of the friction that exists today.\u201d"
