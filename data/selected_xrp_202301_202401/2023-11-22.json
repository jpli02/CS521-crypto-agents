        "title": "XRP Case: SEC Announces Private Meeting, Investors Await Ripple Lawsuit Settlement - U.Today",
        "content": "In a recent development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed a closed-door meeting scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 30. The undisclosed agenda includes crucial topics such as the institution and settlement of injunctive action, administrative proceedings, resolution of litigation claims and other matters related to examinations and enforcement proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the official announcement from the SEC abstains from naming Ripple or XRP directly, the news has reignited speculation within the XRP community. Discussions surrounding the potential settlement of ongoing litigations in the so-called \"XRP case\" have intensified, given the secretive nature of the upcoming meeting.\n\nLast week, U.Today reported on the current status of the Ripple v. SEC legal battle, focusing on the remedies discovery phase. Key dates have been set, with both Ripple and the SEC required to complete their remedies-related discovery by Feb. 12, 2024.\n\nSubsequently, the SEC has until the middle of March to submit briefs outlining the remedies it seeks, and Ripple will have a month to file any opposition. Before a judge can rule on any remedy, the SEC will be granted one last opportunity to respond to Ripple's opposition by the last week of April.\n\nStumbling block worth $770 million\n\nThe pivotal point of contention remains the staggering $770 million fine imposed on Ripple on July 13, marking a significant breakthrough in the XRP case. While leading crypto legal experts anticipate a reduced final figure, the road to settlement is expected to be difficult, with complex discussions and negotiations anticipated.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors are eagerly awaiting the outcome of the SEC's private meeting, which could potentially pave the way for a resolution in the Ripple lawsuit, impacting the future trajectory of XRP on the crypto market."

        "title": "XRP might be looking at a decline even as speculation of Ripple and SEC settling intensify - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ripple and the SEC are said to be close to a settlement as the regulator is scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting on November 30.\n\nBoth parties have until February 2024 to come up with a remedy for the current situation, fueling the speculation.\n\nXRP price decline has extended to nearly 20% in two weeks, reducing the chances of a recovery.\n\nXRP price could likely continue its streak of disappointing investors that began two weeks ago and end up increasing the losses witnessed by investors. This is the condition of the market despite the potential of Ripple and SEC settling the latter\u2019s lawsuit this month and picking up the heat.\n\nRipple and SEC to settle soon\n\nRipple and the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) are expected to conclude the ongoing three-year-long lawsuit that began in December 2020. This would be achieved by both parties settling the case since not only has the SEC partially lost the first ruling from the court, but the next one will be held in 2024.\n\nUntil then, Ripple has a chance to dig up enough evidence to complete their win in the court trial. The closed-door meeting, called the Sunshine Act Meetings, will be held on November 30 next week.\n\nWhile the specifics of the subjects to be discussed are not mentioned in the announcement, the subject matters of the closed meeting will consist of the following topics:\n\nInstitution and settlement of injunctive actions\n\nInstitution and settlement of administrative proceedings\n\nResolution of litigation claims\n\nMatters related to litigation\n\nOther matters relating to examinations and enforcement proceedings\n\nOne of these topics is speculated to regard the SEC and Ripple lawsuit.\n\nIf that turns out to be true and the two entities put an end to one of the biggest lawsuits in crypto history, it would suggest that XRP price is on the heels of a rally.\n\nXRP price might see a further decline\n\nXRP price might find some difficulty in charting gains even after the settlement of the lawsuit, in part due to the broader market cues turning bearish. The decline noted by the Ripple token in the last two weeks has seen the altcoin fall by almost 19%, bringing XRP below the $0.60 mark.\n\nLooking at the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), the chances of a bearish move going forward seem more likely. The indicator maintains a bearish crossover with red bars still standing on the histogram.\n\nThus, if the altcoin sees further decline, a test of the $0.55 support line is likely to follow a failed breach of the $0.59 resistance level. Losing this support would completely wipe out the 31% gain noted in the past month, sending XRP to $0.54.\n\nXRP/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, a successful breach combined with the rising optimism and potential settlement would result in the recovery of XRP price. To ascertain the rally, the $0.60 resistance needs to be flipped into a support floor. This will allow Ripple to tag the next resistance of $0.69, and breaching it would invalidate the bearish thesis, pushing the XRP price beyond $0.70."

        "title": "The \u2018Ripple\u2019 Effect - Harbor Light",
        "content": "When Harbor Springs Elementary principal Nathan Fairbanks decided to start an Outdoor Adventure Club for second-fifth grade students, he had no idea the positive impact it would have\u2026both on his students and his own passion for public education. And this year, the club\u2013 which provides access to everything from ice fishing to geocache hiking\u2013 added a new experience to its list: documentary film stars.\n\nA group of girls, now in grades 7th-4th (the aged-out students serve as \u2018junior guides\u2019), participated on a fly fishing trip on Beaver and Garden Island last summer, with plans for local filmmaker, John Curtis, to tag along for what they expected would be a 10 minute or less short documentary.\n\nThe idea, cast by Fairbanks after attending a fly fishing film festival just before COVID-19 hit, soon became a much bigger production.\n\n\u201cJohn looked at us while he was filming and said, \u2018this is going to be big,\u2019\u201d Fairbanks said in a recent interview. \u201cWe set out to make a film about girls fly fishing because they are underrepresented in the sport. But what we got\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWas so much more,\u201d noted Maggie Kloss, intervention specialist at Harbor Public Schools, who co-leads the club with Fairbanks. \u201cIt was incredible. It just became this story of empowerment. It hits all the things that are so important\u2013 connection to place, connection to each other\u2013 and also, just middle school girls navigating life.\u201d\n\nThe film, Ripple: Casting for Change, turned into a 30-minute feature, and has already been accepted to the Thunder Bay Film Festival, and will likely be added to its list in the near future.\n\nThe film opens on June 21, when the girls and adults flew to Beaver Island via Island Airways, which operates out of Charlevoix Airport. The planes are fairly small, seating about a dozen passengers.\n\nOf all the possibilities that could\u2019ve given anxiety to the six Harbor Springs elementary school girls during an overnight summer fly fishing trip to a remote island in the middle of Lake Michigan, they all agreed on one thing.\n\n\u201cThe small plane that we took over for sure!\u201d said Parker Ford, now a 7th grader at Harbor Springs Middle School.\n\nOnce they got to the island, the group boarded an older, small bus that is made available by the Beaver Island School District for these types of jaunts.\n\n\u201cWell, actually Mrs. Kloss\u2019 driving that small, rusty old bus!\u201d laughed Joanie Baughman, also now a 7th grader, recalling the only real \u201cstress\u201d of the trip.\n\nUpon arrival at the hotel, the Adventure Club members checked into their hotel to drop overnight bags and headed out fishing for the day on Garden Island.\n\nTo get there, they first boarded a charter boat and then transferred to small skiffs that brought the students, adults, and the fishing gear\u2013 rods, flies, waders, boots\u2013 for a day on the water.\n\nOn the second day, the girls and adults took kayaks out on a smaller inland Beaver Island lake to fish for blue gill, before heading back to the mainland and wrapping up the trip.\n\nCurtis, who owns the filmmaking company NM Lifestyle, followed along with his camera, hoping to catch one or two great moments. Instead, the film\u2019s storyline naturally presented itself as an ode to the power of girls and their ability to rise to any challenge,\n\nWhile the 10-year-old Adventure Club is open to boys and girls, this adventure was for girls only, intentionally.\n\n\u201cThis was never about the fish,\u201d said Fairbanks. \u201cIt\u2019s about having a support system, a peer group to share adventures with. Voices to lift you up and encourage you. It\u2019s about believing, belonging and being invited to participate. Young women are strong, capable, and worthy of the same opportunities as everyone else.\u201d\n\nThose sentiments inspired the naming of the film. During the recording of their voice overs, Kloss and Fairbanks brainstormed about what to call the piece, landing on \u201cRipple\u201d because of the expanding effects this experience will have on the girls and their community as they grow their leadership skills.\n\n\u201cWe thought, \u2018What kind of effect will this group of girls have?\u2019 We know it will ripple out into the community and the greater area,\u201d said Kloss. \u201cAnd then we had our name.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a fly fisherman, when I attended that fly fishing film festival, I came away really struck by how the story of this sport is dominated by wealthy, older, white, men. And we happened to have this group of Adventure Club members who had been with us for five years who I knew would be up for this sort of experience. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it, and when I pitched John at a ski movie event\u2013 his daughter had actually made a documentary about the underrepresentation of female snowboarders\u2013 he was immediately like, \u2018I\u2019m in. 100-percent, let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn addition to Ford and Baughman, other girls on the trip (and current grade levels) were Emme Plackemeier, 7th, Natalie Shelton, 4th, Aliyana Boughner, 6th grade, and Marlayna Myllyoja, also in 6th grade.\n\nRecently, the girls met in the library of the middle school to reminisce about the trip and to help promote an upcoming screening of a short film created from it, Ripple: Fairbanks and a former Harbor Springs teacher started the Adventure Club 10 years ago with a group of boys who weren\u2019t involved in extracurriculars and needed extra guidance, the principal explained. As a passionate outdoorsman, the club\u2019s focus was on outdoor activities. The following year, a group of girls approached Maggie Kloss and asked why there wasn\u2019t a girls\u2019 Adventure Club.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s going to change!\u2019\u201d Kloss recalled. \u201cAnd we added the girls\u2019 group to the boys.\u201d\n\nOpen to 2nd through 5th graders at Harbor Springs\u2019 elementary schools, the club typically has 10 to 15 members kids who are passionate about the outdoors as well as kids who want to try something new.\n\nKloss said activities depend on the year and interests of the kids. One year, a group of students was really interested in archery, so that was a main focus. One year, they spent time carving their own duck calls, and one time, they butchered three animals in the Harbor Springs Middle School Cafeteria as they learned to make jerky with the area Quality Deer Management Association.\n\n\u201cThat was something,\u201d Kloss laughed.\n\nThe last few years, the kids have been passionate about ice fishing, so trips have centered around that activity.\n\n\u201cOne cool thing,\u201d Fairbanks said, \u201cis that when we wrap for the season, kids are allowed to take their equipment home.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd another cool thing,\u201d Kloss added, \u201cIs that we have a sort of resource library, so that if parents want to go ice fishing with their kids, they could check out a pole, a shanty, a heater, an auger\u2026everything that they would need. We live in a place where so much is accessible right in our backyards, and we like to celebrate that fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also like to make sure these experiences are accessible to every student,\u201d Fairbanks said. \u201cWatching kids grow in their confidence and comfort and skill levels, watching them form meaningful connections\u2026This is why we got into public education.\u201d\n\nThe club is funded by grants and private donors, which help pay for outings and for students to bring equipment home at the end of the season. For anyone interesting in contributing to the club, contact Fairbanks nfairbacks@harborps.org\n\nRipple: Casting for Change will be released at 7 p.m. on Nov. 30, 2023, at the Lyric Theater in Harbor Springs. It details the story of this unique group and their girls-only excursion. Tickets are $5 for adults and $3 for children, with proceeds benefiting Adventure Club activities and equipment needs."
