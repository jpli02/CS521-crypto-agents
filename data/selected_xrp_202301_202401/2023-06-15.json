        "content": "Today Ripple announced that Colombia\u2019s central bank and Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies (MinTIC) will experiment with Ripple blockchain technology in its high value payment system. While it will use Ripple\u2019s CBDC Platform, underpinned by a private version of the XRP Ledger, the central bank did not explicitly state it would trial a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nColombia\u2019s ICT Minister Mauricio Lizcano mentioned blockchain technology, saying, \u201cit will provide a technological solution (Prototype), which will allow simulations of different use cases in the high-value payment system.\u201d\n\nLocal blockchain technology firm Peersyst Technology is the direct partner with MinTIC.\n\nRipple\u2019s track record with banks\n\nIt\u2019s not a huge surprise that Colombia\u2019s Banco de la Rep\u00fablica will explore Ripple\u2019s technology for high value payments, which is usually interbank payments. Several large banks have adopted the company\u2019s technology without using the public blockchain or XRP. The Colombian collaboration is still a big deal, although it has little to do with XRP.\n\nA couple of months back Ripple acquired Metaco, a digital asset custody technology provider that boasts several systemically important banks as clients.\n\nMeanwhile, Ripple has recently won other engagements with central banks. In April, it announced a collaboration with the Central Bank of Montenegro to explore a pilot for either a CBDC or national stablecoin. Given the country adopted the Euro and is not a member of the EU, a national stablecoin seems more likely. Ripple also has a deal with the Republic of Palau for a USD-backed digital currency and with Bhutan to pilot a CBDC.\n\nIn 2020, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched major litigation against Ripple, alleging the XRP token is an unregistered security. The case is approaching the summary judgment stage, and a raft of disclosures were released this week, which weren\u2019t all in Ripple\u2019s favor."

        "title": "Every Bank in Japan Will Use Ripple\u2019s XRP By 2025\u2032, Says SBI CEO \u2013 Can It Drive Price to $5? Report - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "The CEO of Strategic Business Innovator Group (SBI) shares his thoughts on Bitcoin and Ripple (XRP).\n\nRipple (XRP) is expected to gain massive adoption in the long term according to Yoshitaka Kitao, the CEO of SBI.\n\nYoshitaka Kitao, the CEO of Strategic Business Innovator Group (SBI), a leading financial service firm, has made some notable statements about Bitcoin and Ripple (XRP). The CEO makes clear that Bitcoin is not inherently valuable as an asset. On the other hand, he seems to be very welcoming of Ripple XRP, which he believes will thrive in the long term.\n\nHe explains that there has been significant growth in the use of international remittances using DLT (distributed ledger technology). This also includes Ripple\u2019s virtual currency, which is gaining widespread adoption.\n\nA large number of major fund transfer companies have also tapped into the technology and integrated it. In addition to this, the number of companies using RippleNet has also skyrocketed in recent times. He stated:\n\nMajor fund transfer companies have also begun to introduce it, and the use of \u201cxRapid\u201d using XRP is becoming more widespread, and the number of companies participating in RippleNet is increasing significantly. Therefore, in that sense, I think that Ripple\u2019s technology will gradually be used in the international remittance field, as well as \u201cXRP\u201d. Virtual currency is difficult without \u201creal demand\u201d, but I believe that solid \u201creal demand\u201d will be born in the future.\n\nYoshitaka Kitao has also spoken on Bitcoin and its performance, saying that the asset dropped by 80% because its fundamental value is zero. Pointing to Bitcoin\u2019s performance over the years, he highlighted the asset\u2019s inability to regain momentum after underperforming for a long period of time.\n\nExpressing his views on Bitcoin\u2019s potential long-term performance, he explains that adopting the asset might be even more difficult with the continuous price decline, as opposed to assets like Ripple (XRP), which he referred to as the leading digital currency at this time. Kitao asserted.\n\nSince the fundamental value is zero, it will drop by 80% from the peak. This rarely happens in the stock market. According to the law of the rice market, it has long been said that no matter how much the price drops, it will stop at \u201chalf price multiplied by 20%\u201d, but virtual currency has continued to fall without stopping. After all, it is because there is no fundamental value. Bitcoin basically has no value. It won\u2019t be easy for Bitcoin to become more and more practical when it comes to that price. Therefore, I think that \u201cXRP\u201d will probably become the number one crypto asset among virtual currencies.\n\nRipple success at this time indicates that the future of the entire Ripple is much brighter than critics are willing to admit. In the long run, the XRP\u2019s token is also expected to search to new levels, if the SEC loses its current battle with Ripple.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether, top 10 crypto in red, Fed warning of more rate hikes - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Thursday morning trading in Asia, dropping below US$25,000 at one stage for the first time since mid-March. Ether also retreated with other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies as trading volumes dipped and the U.S. Fed left interest rates unchanged as expected, but warned of more hikes this year to tackle inflation. Ripple\u2019s XRP token fell despite the release of documents this week that were expected to help the company\u2019s defense in an SEC lawsuit.\n\nCrypto in red\n\nBitcoin fell 2.94% over the last 24 hours to US$25,062.60 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 4.69% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about US$490 billion, dipped below the US$25,000 support line to as low as US$24,902 earlier in the morning.\n\nEther fell 4.74% to US$1,652.25, posting a 9.70% loss for the week. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nCardano dropped 4.10% to US$0.2624, losing 18.57% of its value in the past seven days. Solana fell 3.18% to US$14.44 and posted a weekly loss of 22.52%.\n\nThe two tokens have been on a downtrend since being named in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit filed last week against the Binance.US and Coinbase exchanges, where the federal agency categorized the two \u2014 along with many other altcoins \u2014 as financial securities.\n\nBenjamin Stani, the director of business development and sales at crypto trading platform Matrixport, said the declines are mostly the overhang from the SEC suing Binance and Coinbase.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been predominantly the altcoins that have been dropping,\u201d said Stani. \u201cBTC and, to some extent, ETH as well have been holding up better and that I think is mostly attributable to the fact that the SEC named a lot of [altcoins] as securities and that has this chilling effect.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as expected on Wednesday at 5% to 5.25% after ten consecutive hikes to curb inflation.\n\nBut in another negative for investors, Fed chair Jerome Powell said it may take years to get inflation under control, dousing expectations for rate cuts later this year and raising the likelihood of higher interest rates ahead. Stocks ended mixed.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the losers in the crypto top 10 by market capitalization, falling 7.48% to US$0.4793 on the day for a weekly loss of 7.19%.\n\nThe declines came despite the release of the so-called \u201cHinman documents,\u201d this week, a collection of previously sealed emails and pages from former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman. The notes indicate that Ether should not be categorized as a financial security.\n\nRipple Labs Inc. was sued by the SEC in December 2020 on allegations XRP was sold as an illegal unregistered security. Ripple wanted the Hinman documents made public, arguing they show the SEC itself was sending mixed and confused signals over whether cryptocurrencies were securities and failing to offer clear guidance to the industry, which is part of Ripple\u2019s fair notice defense in the case.\n\nHowever, XRP\u2019s price hasn\u2019t benefited from the release of the documents. Gabriel Shapiro, a U.S.-based attorney and the general counsel at blockchain firm Delphi Labs, wrote on Twitter Tuesday \u2014 \u201c\u200b\u200bHinman emails are a nothingburger though great for Ether. No idea why Ripple thinks these emails help Ripple\u2019s case.\u201d\n\nShapiro added that the documents were not the bombshell compared to the \u201chuge hype\u201d given to them.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap lost 2.76% to US$1.02 trillion in the last 24 hours, and the daily crypto trading volume fell 5.37% to US$31.89 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT on downtrend\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 0.86% to 2,912.74 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.64% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions rose 0.13% to US$23.7 million, while sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain by volume, fell 4.78% over the last 24 hours to US$13.52 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nThe Bitcoin network was the second largest NFT network in terms of transactions, rising 6.95% to US$4.1 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe recent buzz in the NFT community is around ERC-6551, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. ERC-6551 is the latest NFT standard for the Ethereum network that went into effect on May 7 this year.\n\n\u201cERC-6551 is introducing a standard for NFTs by unlocking their ability to be a smart wallet that can interact with different decentralized apps in the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cWith ERC-6551, when you transfer an NFT, the wallet and the tokens that the NFT holds also goes with it. Basically wallets within wallets.\u201d\n\nAbout 196 million of Blur tokens worth around US$62 million, 40% of the circulating supply, are being unlocked and distributed to investors and contributors on Wednesday, U.S. time. Blur is the native utility and governance tokens of the Blur NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201c[This] will almost definitely cause a crash in price, which will impact NFT prices,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cBasically, if the token is devalued, will people still want to farm for it via trading NFTs?\u201d\n\nTransactions of Uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 topped sales by collection, selling US$3.14 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum-based BoringPunks marked second with US$1.63 million in sales, with over 20,000 transactions in the past day.\n\nU.S. equity futures edge down\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after a mixed regular trading day on Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.09%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.06% lower and Nasdaq Futures lost 0.09%.\n\nThe U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% after its meeting on Wednesday. The rate is at its highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage last year.\n\nHowever, post-meeting comments from Powell hinted at two more rate hikes by the end of this year, while stating that rate cuts will not happen unless inflation is under control. That didn\u2019t go down well with some business leaders.\n\n\u201cThe battle against inflation is being won. This is now the time for the Fed to stop \u2013 not pause \u2013 interest rate hikes,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an email statement.\n\n\u201cThe time lag for monetary policies is notoriously long \u2014 it typically takes about 18 months to two years for the full effect of rate hikes to filter fully into the economy,\u201d Green said, adding that excessive rate hikes could lead to a recession in the U.S.\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for July 25 to 26.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 30.6% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at July\u2019s meeting, while 69.4% says the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points.\n\n(Updates with equities section)"
