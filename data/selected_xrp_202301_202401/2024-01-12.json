        "content": "TL;DR\n\nThe SEC has filed a motion against Ripple, demanding the company provide certain documents related to the lawsuit.\n\nRipple seeks a brief extension to respond to the SEC\u2019s demands for documentation regarding XRP sales.\n\nThe legal conflict, starting in December 2020, heads towards a grand trial on April 23, 2024, with significant implications for the crypto market.\n\nHas Ripple Violated Laws?\n\nAfter a prolonged period of inactivity, The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested an order compelling the company to hand over two types of essential documents. These are its financial statements for 2022-2023 and its post-Complaint contracts governing \u201cInstitutional Sales.\u201d Federal Judge Torres previously ruled that those transactions did constitute an unregistered securities offering.\n\nAdditionally, the regulator insisted Ripple answer a single interrogatory setting concerning the amount of XRP Institutional Sales proceeds received after filing the Complaint for contracts. The SEC\u2019s recent action seeks to determine whether Ripple has violated certain securities laws.\n\nThe company\u2019s attorneys filed a Motion for Extension of Time, requesting the deadline for a response to be prolonged to January 19:\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, Ripple\u2019s response would be due on Wednesday, January 17, 2024. Ripple respectfully requests an additional two business days to fully respond to the Motion to Compel. This is Ripple\u2019s first request for an extension of time.\u201d\n\nThe Ripple v. SEC Saga Nears Trial\n\nThe fiasco between the two entities, which started in December 2020, has its trial scheduled for April 23, 2024. Ripple seemingly has the upper hand after securing three vital (yet partial) victories in 2023.\n\nBoth sides are required to comply with necessary procedures before meeting in court. The watchdog must file its brief with respect to remedies by March 13, 2024, whereas Ripple must file its opposition by April 12, 2024.\n\nThe XRP army (the way the crypto industry refers to XRP aficionados) and many industry participants await the outcome of the case due to its potential impact. A decisive win for Ripple might trigger an overall market boom, while the opposite scenario could hamper the sector and lead to the implementation of stringent rules."

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nStory Highlights SEC files motion to force Ripple to reveal financial records and specific sales contracts related to alleged unregistered security offerings.\n\nJudge previously ruled Ripple illegally sold $729 million in XRP but didn't classify XRP as a security overall.\n\nSettlement between Ripple and SEC possible after court sets one-month deadline for responses.\n\nWell, it\u2019s like 2023 all over again!\n\nRipple is once again in the spotlight with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulatory body has taken a significant step, filing a motion to compel Ripple to share its financial statements for the fiscal year 2022-2023, along with the contracts governing \u201cinstitutional sales.\u201d This development adds to the ongoing tension between Ripple and the SEC.\n\nSEC\u2019s Motion to Compel\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent action took place on January 11 when it submitted a formal request to the Southern District of New York Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn. The request specifically asks the court to mandate Ripple\u2019s submission of financial statements and sales contracts.\n\nThis follows Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 earlier ruling on July 13, 2023, where she partially sided with Ripple but concluded that the company had violated rules by engaging in unregistered transactions, offering and selling securities to certain institutional buyers, hedge funds, and ODL customers.\n\nThe key verdict\n\nJudge Torres\u2019 ruling highlighted that Ripple unlawfully sold approximately $729 million in XRP through these transactions. The decision rested on provisions within the Institutional Sales contracts, suggesting that the involved parties did not perceive XRP as a commodity or currency sale.\n\nAlso Read: SEC is A Menace, Claims Ripple CLO Amid Spot Bitcoin ETF Confusion\n\nThe Ball is in Ripple\u2019s Court!\n\nDespite multiple attempts through calls and emails, Ripple has yet to present any of the post-complaint documents. The SEC, undeterred by Ripple\u2019s objections, is now moving to compel the production of two specific document requests and one interrogatory.\n\nIn a Thursday filing, the SEC emphasized, \u201ceven though Ripple has unjustifiably objected to all requests, the SEC is only moving to compel on two narrow document requests and one interrogatory.\u201d\n\nWaiting for a Resolution\n\nThe court has granted both parties a one-month window, extending beyond the remedies-related discovery deadline. This timeline allows the SEC to present its case to the court and provides Ripple with the opportunity to object. Speculation looms large that a settlement may be on the horizon, given the impending deadlines and the history of contentious exchanges between Ripple and the SEC.\n\nRead More; XRP ETFs Will Not Be Approved This Year Due to Legal Fight With SEC \u2013 Bloomberg Analyst"

        "content": "No one was hurt, but the shooting led to an hourslong SWAT standoff at a rental property with two convicted felons who are not supposed to have a gun.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 A man with an AR-15-style rifle allegedly fired a shot at a woman in a road rage incident in Broad Ripple Wednesday morning.\n\nNo one was hurt, but the shooting led to an hourslong SWAT standoff at a rental property with two convicted felons who are not supposed to have a gun.\n\nA woman told police she was driving north on Keystone Avenue on Jan. 10 around 9 a.m. when a charter bus moved over into her lane. She honked at the bus. At the 38th Street stoplight, she said the man driving the empty bus allegedly yelled at the woman and threw things at her Chevy Tahoe. Further up Keystone Avenue, the woman said the bus moved into her lane and struck the passenger side of her SUV, causing damage.\n\nShe followed the bus to Broad Ripple to get the license plate information, down the alley behind Broad Ripple Avenue off Evanston Avenue.\n\nCourt records say surveillance video from the rental property owner shows the driver of the bus run to the back door of the residence. Another man answers, and the driver runs back toward the bus with a rifle. A single gunshot can be heard on the video.\n\nThe driver of the SUV showed police her own cellphone video of the driver of the bus with a gun. She said when that gun was pointed at her, she ducked under the dash and heard a shot fired.\n\nChris Aasen, the owner of Broad Ripple Lock Service, heard the shot from his office next door.\n\n\u201cI saw him hand his weapon off to somebody inside the (rental property), and he got back inside the bus and was coming down the alley,\u201d said Aasen, looking out his office window.\n\nBoth men wound up back inside the residence before police arrived. A SWAT standoff lasted about six hours.\n\n\"It was like nothing we'd ever seen,\u201d Aasen said. \u201cThere was SWAT out back in the alley, and there was SWAT out front \u2014 plenty of police officers. They were sounding the horns. They were telling him to come out, surrender, to whatever. Then, it just did never happen, obviously. So, they had to take action to go in.\"\n\nOne man eventually came out after several hours. He told police he did not own a gun and did not provide a gun to the alleged shooter.\n\nThe SWAT team entered and searched the residence before finding the alleged shooter hiding under the building.\n\n\"He was underneath a little unit that they kind of did an addition on,\u201d Aasen said. \u201cIt's kind of built on a deck. It can't be more than maybe eight inches to a foot high, and he'd crawled up underneath there.\"\n\nPolice did not recover the gun. The alleged shooter was arrested on a probation violation out of Monroe County. Both men are held in the Marion County jail, awaiting charges for being convicted felons with a gun.\n\n\"Really odd, weird day,\u201d Aasen said. \u201cYou never know for the safety of the neighborhood what's going to happen when a situation like that goes down.\""
