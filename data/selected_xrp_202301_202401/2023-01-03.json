        "content": "The Harvard report explains how Ripple and Stellar can facilitate faster settlements of CBDCs worldwide.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP and Stellar Lumens have thus become a go-to choice for several International businesses.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is engaged in a major battle with Ripple, other market players continue to see major value in this blockchain network. Harvard University recently published a report on the pathway for US Digital Dollar.\n\nIn the report, the author Jayesh Mehta mentions that blockchain technology has become mature enough to handle FIAT currency in the digital format. Interestingly, the report also mentions that blockchain networks like Ripple and Stellar Lumens have seen growing acceptance while becoming the preferred choice for international businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides, the report also goes on to explain how these two blockchain platforms can facilitate instant CBDC settlements worldwide while leveraging the power of AI and Machine Learning. This process also involves an ML-controlled FX interface. The author explains the entire seven-step automated process for the immutable fund transfer chain.\n\nThe sender would initiate the transaction in FIAT currency, receive the private key and give it to the receiver. The send would choose either immediate conversion or future date conversion and give instructions to the ML-driven FX platform. Based on instructions, the FX interface would convert FIAT to either XRP or XLM. The ML-controlled Smart Contract will execute the instructions. The FX interface shall send the crypto to the receiver. The XRP blockchain shall handle immutability and the verification process. The execution shall be handled with ML-implemented smart contracts. The receiver would use the private keys sent by the sender and receive funds either in XLM or XRP tokens. The receiver can convert the crypto to the FIAT of his/her choice instantaneously or on a future date. The ML-driven smart contracts will handle the future date execution.\n\nRipple and Stellar\u2019s Growing Market Penetration\n\nMajor economies across the world have been gearing up to launch their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). However, many experts believe that instead of building the CBDC infrastructure from the ground up, central banks can leverage the existing infrastructure to cater to their instant settlement needs.\n\nAs per the latest report, the Stellar Lumens blockchain can serve as the base layer for CBDCs worldwide. Stellar Lumens CEO Denelle Dixon recently stated that they are keen to work with the war-torn country of Ukraine to launch their CBDC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Stellar Lumens along with Ripple\u2019s XRP have become part of ISO 20022 which makes them suitable and compliant for CBDCs. Furthermore, the Harvard University report notes that CBDCs can work along with stablecoins, and Ripple and Stellar can easily handle such transactions.\n\nAdditionally, Tipple is already expanding its ODL solution to more than 40 countries. Thus, it has the infrastructure ready to cater to global economies. Here\u2019s how Ripple\u2019s XRP Ledger can work efficiently with CBDCs worldwide."

        "title": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse: 2023 Is Our Year! - VOI English",
        "content": "JAKARTA blockchain-based cross-border payment company, Ripple, is still facing a lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is not sure when the feud will end.\n\nHowever, Garlinghouse is optimistic about the clarity of crypto regulations that the US government will discuss in 2023. Therefore, he hopes that this year crypto regulations in the US will be clearer than ever. This is because it will benefit both parties, both the crypto industry and the government.\n\nToday is the first day of the 118th Congress. While previous efforts on regulatory clarity for crypto in the US have stalled, I am carefully optimistic that 2023 is our year (finals!) will see a breakthrough... Brad Garlinghouse wrote in a Twitter post (@bgarlinghouse), January 3, 2023.\n\nToday is the first day of the 118th Congress. While prior efforts at regulatory clarity for crypto in the US have stalled, I am cautiously optimistic that 2023 is the year we will (finally!) see a breakthrough. A thread on why\u2026 \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2023\n\nFurthermore, he believes that the US government is not drafting rules for empty writing boards', referring to a number of laws such as the Securities Clarity Act, the Financial Innovation Act that is Responsible, and Clearness for the Digital Token Act as an example.\n\nDespite being optimistic, Garlinghouse outlined that the government's drafted crypto rules cannot be separated from deficiencies. According to him, there is no perfect bill and most likely there will never be a bill that satisfies everyone.\n\nLaunching Cointelegraph, in seeking a perfect bill, Congress should not hinder progress in creating crypto laws and regulations. Garlinghouse argues that in terms of crypto regulation, the US lags behind a number of other countries such as Singapore, Japan, Brazil and the European Union.\n\nFurthermore, the Ripple CEO assessed that the lack of regulatory clarity for the crypto industry in the United States had prompted companies to leave the US. They choose a country that has loose rules on crypto. However, it is also inseparable from the potential for a disaster'' as experienced by FTX operating in the Bahamas.\n\nCurrently, Ripple is still at odds with the SEC in court. In mid-2020, Ripple plans to go public on a leading US stock exchange. However, in December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple on charges of selling unregistered securities.\n\nUS regulators include XRP in the securities category. Ripple denied all SEC allegations and called XRP non-security. A number of leading companies provide their support for Ripple including Coinbase, I-Remits, TapJets, and so on. Until now, the Ripple vs SEC case has not found a bright spot.\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP is trading at IDR 5,445 per coin. On January 7, 2018, XRP broke its all-time high at the level of IDR 45,650. Five years since then, XRP has struggled to deal with negative sentiment from its competitors. The price of XRP fell 88.1 percent from ATH.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

        "title": "Ripple CTO Vs. Craig Wright Fight Enters Round 2 - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ripple CTO David Schwartz and self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor Craig Wright clashed for the first time around the Christmas holidays in a verbal altercation on Twitter. As Bitcoinist reported, the dispute ended with Schwartz ignoring his counterpart while Wright threatened to submit a scientific paper on XRP to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as support in the lawsuit.\n\nAfter a brief lull in the fight, the verbal dispute found a revival over the last two days. Wright, the leading figure behind Bitcoin SV (BSV), responded to a screenshot of a years-old tweet from Schwartz in which the Ripple CTO stated that Wright is not the inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nWright didn\u2019t let that stand, saying that the Ripple CTO doesn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s not \u201cjust\u201d a computer science problem. \u201cNot banking, not economics, not law. And this is why XRP is failing,\u201d Wright continued.\n\nTriggered by that statement, Schwartz settled into round two of the verbal battle, asking \u201ccuriously\u201d what his definition of failing is. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not market cap given that XRP\u2019s market cap is around $17 billion and BSV\u2019s is less than $1 billion. Maybe it\u2019s market volume? XRP at $330 million versus BSV at about $20 million? Nope, I guess it\u2019s not that either,\u201d Schwartz said, adding:\n\nIt\u2019s your minor fork of a minor fork that\u2019s failing by every conceivable metric as you keep lashing out at everyone who forces you to confront any tiny sliver of reality.\n\nRipple Can\u2019t Scale XRP\n\nSubsequently, the discussion evolved toward Wright\u2019s claim that the XRP Ledger cannot scale. Both competitors debated the merits and weaknesses of XRP compared to Wright\u2019s Bitcoin alternative \u2013 BSV. According to Wright, the blockchain that can scale will prevail, which the Bitcoin SV founder says only works with larger blocks.\n\nThe Ripple CTO countered that there are two main reasons why this is not true. \u201cOne is that I think nearly all layer 1\u2019s will scale if there\u2019s enough demand, whether through federation, roll ups, higher layers, or other ways,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\nOn the other hand, Schwartz believes layer 1 doesn\u2019t need to scale, it just needs to exist and be usable to move the vast majority of traffic to more efficient mechanisms.\n\n[\u2026] And my position on this has changed a few times. It\u2019s also not a yes/no thing. It\u2019s really a question of how much scaling will provide how much difference in value/utility. I do not believe layer 1\u2019s will need millions of txns/sec for decades, if ever.\n\nCalvin Ayre, Craig Wright\u2019s verbose sidekick, countered the argument with the following words:\n\nThis is why you should stop talking\u2026all of this can be done on chain\u2026the tech has existed since 2009 when Craig released Bitcoin\u2026.nChain has bits of it patented now. Just shut up and watch since you clearly don\u2019t understand.\n\nDavid Schwartz was visibly annoyed by the wild name-calling:\n\nYou are responding to a reasoned argument with vague gibberish mixed with personal insults just as Craig does. I can see why you two get along so well.\n\nSchwartz also ultimately rejected the idea that he instigated the whole affair, claiming that he was merely pointing out how wrong Wright was. Ultimately, he ended round two by saying:\n\nHe [Craig Wright] is only interested in XRP because he thinks that if I think he\u2019s hurting XRP, I\u2019ll stop pointing out that he\u2019s wrong in public. He only started talking about it when I showed that an argument he made (that had nothing to do with XRP) was complete nonsense.\n\nAt press time, the XRP price stood at $0.3470 after seeing a long-legged Doji candle in the 1-day chart yesterday.\n\nFeatured image from Forbes, Chart from TradingView.com"
