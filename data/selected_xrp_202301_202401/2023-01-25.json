        "content": "The XRP Ledger Foundation, which is a nonprofit support organization for XRPL and one of the three publishers of the unique node list, has presented important updates. The key change can be considered the removal of one of the Ripple validators from it. The action is explained by the need to bring the list in line with a policy where one entity cannot have multiple validators on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the Ripple validator, the University of Korea validator was also removed from the list. Reportedly, its operator was \"unresponsive for weeks\" and was occupying a slot for a negative unique node list, where temporarily offline validators are contained during crashes or maintenance updates.\n\nXRPL newbie\n\nAt the same time, there are additions to the XRP Ledger Foundation's lists. For example, with the latest update, Aesthetes, an NFT marketplace for \"phygital\" items on XRP Ledger, was added to the list. As noted, their work has proven the traits of a good network participant.\n\nWith the update of XRP Ledger Foundation's unique node list, the number of validators has dropped from 35 to 34, which is a deviation from the rules. Nevertheless, further additions are expected. The other list publishers, Ripple and Coil, have not submitted changes to their lists yet."

        "content": "The SEC vs Ripple case is about to reach an end, thus the users started speculating on the price of XRP.\n\nThe development and advancement in the XRPLedger will affect the price of XRP token.\n\nThe long battle between United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs Inc. will reportedly end soon. Hence, the crypto users began their speculation on the price action of XRP tokens. It must be noted that the token was created by Ripple Labs in late 2020.\n\nSEC vs Ripple Case\n\nThere are several speculations about the result of the ongoing SEC vs Ripple case. Many believe that Ripple would have settled the case out of court while the U.S. regulator seems unwilling to declare that XRP is not a security.\n\nRipple Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brad Garlinghouse is working on the specific direction that there would be no requirement for any legal procedure. Also for defining the status of the XRP token which may include Ripple in the future.\n\nRecently, the victory of SEC against LBRY, a protocol, gave the regulator a huge impetus to believe it can have a good victory against Ripple. Meanwhile, Ripple thinks that it will win the case against SEC with more than three thousand Amicus Briefs. That will be showing the usage of XRP is limited to payment utility.\n\nThis SEC vs Ripple case began in 2020 when SEC alleged that Ripple raised more than $1 Billion in 2013 through the sale of XRP in an unregistered security offering to investors around the globe.\n\nMeanwhile, Ripple relied on the previous comments of an SEC director to support its case and kept its point that XRP should not be treated as a security. Now the result of this battle will have far-reaching consequences for the whole cryptocurrency industry.\n\nXRP Price Analysis\n\nAt press time, the XRP is trading at $0.409680 with a 24-hour trading volume of $1.22 Billion. The token is down around 4.47% with current market cap to $20.81 Billion. Due to the ongoing battle of SEC and Ripple, the price of XRP token and also marked to its lowest price point of $0.2906 in the past 52 weeks.\n\nSource: XRP by CoinMarketCap\n\nIn the last seven days, XRP noted an increase of almost 16% in its price. As its seven days low was at $0.3713 and high was at $0.4311."

        "title": "The State of Global Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Adoption with Darrell Duffie - Ripple",
        "content": "Each quarter we\u2019ll be going under the hood with professors from Ripple\u2019s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) to gain a deeper understanding of trending topics in crypto and blockchain, and highlight their insights and key takeaways.\n\nThere seem to be almost as many opinions about the viability and best use of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as there are countries currently exploring them. That\u2019s 114 for those keeping count.\n\nEven in the United States, there are mixed views on CBDCs. While the Undersecretary for Domestic Finance at the Treasury downplayed the need for one late last year, American Banker kicked off the new year with a headline about the increased pace of CBDC projects in 2023.\n\nTo get some clarity, we sat down with Professor Darrell Duffie, the Adams Distinguished Professor of Management and Professor of Finance at Stanford Graduate School of Business and an active UBRI participant.\n\nCheck out the conversation below for a deep dive on the state of CBDCs today and what he thinks is next from a global perspective.\n\nWhich countries are seeing the most traction with CBDCs and who do you predict will have the next pilots or proofs of concept in production?\n\nCBDCs are a global phenomenon. There are now more than one hundred countries representing over 95 percent of the world\u2019s GDP exploring a CBDC, all at different stages of development.\n\nAmong large countries, the U.S. is the least advanced in developing a central bank digital currency, in part due to the lack of government regulations, while China\u2014even though it already has top-notch digital and mobile payment solutions like Alipay and WeChat Pay\u2014is the furthest ahead. Yet, despite China\u2019s progress, the digital yuan (e-CNY) has had limited traction. Part of this can likely be attributed to privacy concerns by its citizens.\n\nThe rest of the world is somewhere in between these two margins. Some smaller countries\u2014like the Bahamas and Nigeria\u2014have already formally introduced CBDCs into their economies but have not seen high usage or consumer adoption. In these countries, adoption lags not just because of the introduction of the CBDCS, but due to lack of Internet access and education about how to use digital wallets.\n\nOn the flip side, Brazil successfully upgraded its commercial bank payments using its new Pix system, and is now developing a CBDC for \u201cwholesale\u201d financial applications. Others like India, Singapore, Hong Kong and the eurozone are all engaged in pilots or testing.\n\nWhat do you see as being the main drivers of adoption and exploration of CBDCs?\n\nEach country has its own reasons for exploring a CBDC. Some\u2014like Sweden, Canada, Palau and Bhutan\u2014want to ensure the existence of a digital national currency in the event that paper money goes out of circulation, or becomes too costly to print and has a negative impact on the environment. Where currency doesn\u2019t have to be printed or coins don\u2019t have to be minted, there are opportunities for significant cost savings. Other countries desire wholesale-only CBDC applications, are fostering the development of more advanced payment systems, or are examining a CBDC as a way to boost financial inclusion.\n\nIn this early stage of development, every central bank has some amount of FOMO\u2014or fear of missing out\u2014and wants to ensure they have a viable CBDC project underway so that they don\u2019t fall behind or in case the technology turns out to be quite useful for applications such as cross-border payments and international settlement.\n\nStill, many central bankers remain unsure of the ultimate use case for or utility of the technology and are moving slowly so as not to disrupt their commercial banks.\n\nDespite this uncertainty, I expect most countries to continue working on CBDC development. In particular, many European countries are moving quickly towards a digital euro. Russia is also working on a CBDC, perhaps highly motivated by backstopping its access to international payment systems.\n\nWhat\u2019s your pulse on current sentiment around CBDCs and stablecoins in the US?\n\nAttitudes towards CBDC and stablecoin development vary by agency and branch of the U.S. government.\n\nIn a 2022 executive order earlier, the Biden Administration asked for recommendations on how to improve the U.S. economy using digital assets like CBDCs and stablecoins, and via better regulation. The Treasury Department responded with suggestions ranging from the use of existing payment methods like digital bank payments to the development of both public and private digital currencies.\n\nWithout clear direction from the President and Congress about how and when to move forward on issuing a CBDC, the U.S. Federal Reserve is proceeding cautiously to ensure collaboration between banking regulators, central banks and commercial banks. Meanwhile, the Fed is engaged in basic research on digital currencies. For example, Project Hamilton, a joint effort between the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, is exploring the core technical issues of a CBDC and is one of two active projects. Project Cedar, at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is researching the use of wholesale CBDCs for interbank and other wholesale financial applications like settling bond trades and making foreign exchange payments.\n\nSo where do we go from here to help accelerate global CBDC adoption?\n\nIf central bankers in the U.S. do move forward with developing a digital currency, one critical consideration will be how best to encourage its use by consumers, given the high barriers to adoption such as education, security and privacy.\n\nTake credit cards for example. It\u2019s easy to imagine consumers choosing to use a credit card over a CBDC in order to earn travel or cash back rewards. Without an added incentive, widespread adoption of a CBDC will be tricky. And banks will probably not want to cannibalize their existing profitable payment services. In response to this, countries like the Bahamas and Jamaica are offering incentives to citizens to use CBDCs to purchase local goods and services. This makes choosing to use a CBDC more enticing for citizens, rather than paying interest rates mandated by credit card companies.\n\nConsumer education campaigns won\u2019t be enough. The government and the Fed should actively work to surmount these global CBDC challenges and boost competition and innovation in payment systems. This could include, for example, capping interchange fees at a lower level to limit credit card rewards, or mandating a standardization of apps through which banks offer CBDC payments and new fast-payment systems like FedNow. For at least some years, FedNow could be a very effective substitute for a digital dollar, if provided in an highly accessible and interoperable way.\n\nCountries are learning that it\u2019s not simply a case of \u201cif you build it, they will come.\u201d Thoughtful consumer education, upgraded infrastructure and meaningful incentives are needed to accelerate adoption and lower global CBDC challenges.\n\nIrrespective of the U.S., the pace of CBDC development around the world will accelerate over the coming years, with more and more countries moving into active pilots or tests. Whether deployed for domestic economic purposes or for cross-border transactions, the usefulness of CBDCs will grow as adoption increases and specific use cases are proven out.\n\nTo learn more about Ripple\u2019s CBDC solution, visit ripple.com/cbdc or download the latest CBDC report from Futurum.\n\nFor additional UBRI insights, check out the latest research report."
