        "content": "Today Ripple announced it is paying $250 million to acquire 100% of Metaco, the Swiss digital asset custody firm. Metaco\u2019s technology is used by a raft of mainstream banks. Since mid-2021 alone, it has signed up BNP Paribas Securities Services, SocGen Forge, Citi as well as German banks DekaBank and DZ Bank. Other banking clients include DBS, BBVA and Standard Chartered\u2019s Zodia Custody.\n\nMetaco is one of the few major custody firms not to have done massive capital raisings. It has raised just $20 million, including $17 million in 2020. In contrast, custody firms such as Copper and Anchorage have raised hundreds of millions, and Fireblocks over a billion.\n\nFounder and CEO Adrien Treccani will stay on as CEO with Metaco being run as a separate brand.\n\n\u201cThrough the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint,\u201d said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple.\n\nWhile Ripple currently grabs headlines for its high profile lawsuit with the SEC over the XRP cryptocurrency, the company isn\u2019t new to servicing banks. Historically Ripple offered banks its RippleNet solution, a permissioned payment messaging system that competes with SWIFT and does not use XRP. It attracted some big name banks such as Santander and MUFG. But the banks privately voiced frustration at the conflation of their Ripple activities with crypto and XRP. That conflation might be demonstrated in the almost 6% spike in the price of XRP during the past 24 hours (rather than the time of the formal announcement).\n\nMore recently, Ripple has made big moves in central bank digital currency (CBDC). These types of digital currencies invariably involve banks as intermediaries. So the alliance with Metaco makes sense for Ripple.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is how happy some of Metaco\u2019s institutional clients are about the takeover. On the one hand, Ripple\u2019s technology skills are highly regarded. The question is whether the SEC lawsuit creates discomfort."

        "content": "Financial technology company Ripple acquired Switzerland-based crypto custody firm Metaco as U.S. crypto firms look overseas amid a regulatory crackdown at home.\n\nKey Takeaways U.S.-based fintech firm Ripple acquired Swiss crypto custody service provider Metaco.\n\nThe deal is said to provide Ripple with increased exposure to regulatory environments outside the U.S. and enable it to offer a larger suite of crypto products and services.\n\nCrypto firms in the U.S. are facing enforcement actions and a perceived lack of regulatory clarity.\n\nCoinbase and Gemini have also recently made moves to diversify global footprint.\n\nWhile terms weren't disclosed, the company tapped into $250 million of its own cash on hand to make it happen. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called it \"the largest deal we've seen in the last year.\" The acquisition is expected to increase Ripple's suite of crypto products and services, as well as provide access to major Metaco clients such as Citi and BBVA.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to play offense,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deal will increase Ripple's international presence at a time when enforcement actions are forcing crypto companies to exit the U.S. market.\n\nRipple was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020 for issuing the digital asset XRP without proper registration. Garlinghouse has said he doesn't expect a final ruling for some months. He estimates the company will spend more than $200 million fighting the SEC's charges.\n\nRipple isn't the only crypto business looking to stretch outside the U.S. Last month, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong suggested his company could relocate outside the U.S. if regulations weren't clarified in the coming years. The company is expanding into new jurisdictions, receiving a license to operate in Bermuda last month. Also in April Gemini established an Asia Pacific business, including an engineering center in Gurgaon, India, to be led by Global CTO Pravjit Tiwana.\n\nBinance recently left Canada in response to new regulations on the crypto industry there.\n\nThe European Union yesterday adopted its own crypto regulatory framework in the form of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), which has drawn praise from crypto firms seeking clarity. Coinbase called MiCA's approval \"a pivotal moment for crypto in the region.\"\n\n\"The work of European policymakers should be held up as an example,\" the company said in a statement."
