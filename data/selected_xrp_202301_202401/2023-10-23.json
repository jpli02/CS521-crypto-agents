        "title": "What Are The Odds of the SEC Winning the Lawsuit Against Ripple (XRP)? Attorney Chips In - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\n\n\nJeremy Hogan sees a declining probability of the SEC winning against Ripple after key executives were cleared from charges.\n\nHogan hints the SEC might drag the lawsuit to 2026, but with a minimal victory chance.\n\nChatGPT anticipates a surge in XRP\u2019s price with a possible peak at $10 if Ripple prevails.\n\nThe SEC Seems Doomed to Lose\n\nThe popular US lawyer and Partner at Hogan & Hogan \u2013 Jeremy Hogan \u2013 pinpointed a few possibilities that might occur before the final resolution of the lengthy lawsuit between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn his view, the regulator\u2019s chances to win the case have dropped since the company\u2019s CEO \u2013 Brad Garlinghouse \u2013 and Executive Chairman \u2013 Chris Larsen \u2013 were cleared of all charges.\n\n\u201cThe SEC dismissed the rest of the case, so there will be no trial next year. The facts have been set \u2013 nothing new or surprising will be coming out. Which means the Court will be issuing a Final Judgment (probably) sometime next year. Only Ripple needs to worry about that,\u201d the attorney claimed.\n\nHe also believes that the blockchain enterprise would emerge victorious, while the SEC has a 14.2% chance to win after a subsequent appeal. According to him, the Commission\u2019s best shot for a decisive victory is to delay the legal process, get through more hearings, and eventually reach another plead.\n\nHogan assumed that such a scenario would prolong the battle until 2026 and would give the agency a mere 2.3% chance to triumph. He compared the odds to the ones set for the New York Jets to win the Super Bowl 2024. It is worth mentioning that the last time the team lifted the trophy was in 1969, as it was the only time they reached the final match.\n\nWhere Would XRP Land if Ripple Wins?\n\nAccording to the AI-powered language model ChatGPT, a decisive victory against the US SEC could significantly boost the valuation of Ripple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP. It went further, estimating that the $10 level is in the cards, assuming other crucial factors are in place.\n\nRestoration of trust, potential partnerships, market sentiment, and competitive landscape were some of the outlined elements. \u201cEven if Ripple wins its case against the SEC, there could be other regulatory challenges in the future, both in the US and internationally,\u201d ChatGPT stated.\n\nThose wishing to see XRP\u2019s possible trajectory in the short term and find out whether the market is at a turning point could take a look at our video:"

        "content": "envisioning the Louisiana Music and Heritage Experience Museum\n\nArchitecture firm Eskew Dumez Ripple unveils its proposal for the Louisiana Music and Heritage Experience Museum in Downtown New Orleans. Boasting instrument-like features inspired by AI-generated images, specifically via Midjourney, this 11,148 sqm contemporary art space is intended to showcase and highlight the city\u2019s contributions to the music industry as a whole. The building sits across the street from the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center and offers visitors a state-of-the-art exhibit space, a performance theater or soundstage, a research/archival area, a facility sales space, an expansive lobby, a museum store, and classroom/education areas. Completing the program, the architects envisioned a music club and restaurant for museum visitors to enjoy the sounds and tastes of New Orleans culture.\n\n\n\nall renders courtesy Eskew Dumez Ripple\n\nEskew Dumez Ripple uses AI to turn instruments into structures\n\nThe design team at Eskew Dumez Ripple sought inspiration from music and instruments, particularly how the latter were created to generate specific sounds. One example is the outer shell of the Louisiana Music and Heritage Experience Museum, evoking the hollowed-out body of a guitar. Seen in the design of the rooftop terrace and full exterior facade, this mimicking of shape turns the relationship between exhibit and architecture quite \u2018symphonic\u2019, as the architects describe it. To conceptualize such a form, the studio employed the popular text-to-image software Midjourney, sparking wider inspiration with surprising results. With access to a vast archive of instrument images, these algorithms helped Eskew Dumez Ripple discern the nuances of form, texture, and proportion that define various musical instruments. Images of guitars, violins, saxophones, and cymbals were input, accompanied by descriptions like \u2018Zumthor architecture,\u2019 \u2018dramatic lighting,\u2019 and \u2018cinematic\u2019 to add dimensional instructions for creative outputs.\n\n\n\nusing AI to generate architectural forms inspired by musical instruments\n\nThis AI-powered research ultimately generated a vast spectrum of architectural forms and styles in the form of massing studies, mainly drawing inspiration, again, from instruments \u2014 resulting in the guitar-like design taking over the Museunm\u2019s outer shell. \u2018Form and function pair together in both cases: to produce sound from a guitar and to provide a multifunctional outdoor terrace feature for the celebration of Louisiana\u2019s contribution to the music industry,\u2019 notes the team. As visitors walk through each corner and room, they can intrinsically sense design notes taken from violins, guitars, and various brass instruments throughout the outer building details, with sinuous and flowing lines reflected gently and poetically throughout the Louisiana Music and Heritage Experience Museum.\n\n\n\nvertical gallery perspective\n\n\n\nsinuous lines evoking musical instruments and notes\n\n\n\nRecord Store within the museum"
