        "title": "The ripple effect of philanthropy - Economist Impact",
        "content": "New models for collaboration and action\n\nFoundations frequently ask non-profits to partner with other like-minded organisations for grants, and with the goal of building a larger conservation coalition. But philanthropy can also be a seed to cultivate other partnerships. Philanthropic seed funds can direct researchers, entrepreneurs and business leaders to build partnerships that expand the reach of conservation solutions and increase business opportunities while supporting community development.\n\nSuch collaboration is not always welcomed by all stakeholders, particularly environmentalists, because these tactics engage conservation around impacts and incorporate wider values such as job creation and rewards. Yet these kinds of partnership are critical: for our ocean and planet, we are at an \u201call hands on deck\u201d moment.\n\nI grew up in Ireland during a time when divisions in Northern Ireland fostered violence and poverty. I witnessed first-hand that peace and prosperity emerged only when the two bitterly opposing sides\u2014who felt they had nothing in common and had inflicted great harm on each other\u2014sat down together and found commonality and a way to share power. The late Archbishop Desmond Tutu often spoke of the need for opponents to talk and work together. Philanthropy can be that catalyst for the courage to work with those with whom we disagree.\n\nBy paying attention to the ripple effect of philanthropy, we can create new models for sustainable ocean funding and solutions. And philanthropy can be the seed that germinates new forms of collaboration for the long-term benefit of ocean and communities."

        "content": "Tue 28 Mar 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C.\n\nRipple executives are glimpsing a victory against the SEC. A ruling is expected to take place before the end of this year. The outcome of the case will have a significant impact on crypto regulation in the US.\n\nMoving to a victory for Ripple against the SEC?\n\nFor several years, Ripple and its XRP token had been in the sights of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The American stock market regulator has long accused Ripple Labs of issuing unregistered securities. The SEC and Ripple are now pleading their cases in court.\n\nCurrently, Brad Garlinghouse is confident about the outcome of the SEC\u2019s trial against Ripple and its XRP token. According to Ripple executives, the \u201cfacts and the law\u201d are in their favor. That makes it unlikely that the SEC will win the lawsuit.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, the president of Ripple Labs, said she is \u201cvery hopeful\u201d of a positive outcome for Ripple in the lawsuit.\n\nThe payment company\u2019s president also highlighted the importance of regulatory clarity and certainty for the entire crypto industry, which wants to see the SEC set clear rules rather than simply crack down on companies.\n\nBrad Garlinghouse expects a ruling in the case before the end of 2023\n\nDespite recent events, including the closure of pro-crypto banks, Monica Long believes that the crypto industry and blockchain technology are here to stay. For her, the fact that cryptos have shown strong resilience to the banking crisis is a good sign.\n\nIn conclusion, Ripple continues to be optimistic about the outcome of the SEC\u2019s trial. Its executives hope that this case, which, as Brad Garlinghouse stated, the scope of fallout could impact the entire crypto market, will help establish regulatory clarity for the crypto sector in the United States.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Three bank failures in a matter of weeks (Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse, and Signature Bank) have put policymakers and regulators into action to restore enhanced prudential standards, revise liquidity coverage ratios, and tighten credit and capital market rules to restore market confidence. Regional banks will brace for stricter risk control, a lending pullback, and withdraws in deposits as depositors seek refuge in the bigger banks.\n\nThis crisis will send ripples through the tech industry, already weakened by layoffs in the first quarter of 2023:\n\nThe crisis will exacerbate a slowdown in funding to tech startups. Constraints on capital access will raise costs for tech startups.

Tech spending growth in IT services will also slow. IT services companies have high exposure to BFSI. Indian IT service companies draw the bulk of their revenues from the financial services sector. TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and Cognizant drive more than 30% of their revenues from the BFSI sector, leaving them more exposed than Accenture. Liquidity concerns for BFSI across the US and Europe can constrain tech spend growth. A banking crisis could delay the ramp-up of critical IT projects, impacting key revenue targets and pushing back new order closures that can drag down the IT services market in 2023.\n\nDespite these challenges, Forrester\u2019s report, US Tech Market Forecast, 2022 To 2027, highlights that the BFSI sector is resilient with historically strong growth in tech spend. Investments in data centers, cybersecurity risk mitigation, and the migration to cloud will remain important drivers for long-term tech spend.\n\nTo learn more about the relationship between the banking crisis and tech spend, please schedule a guidance session or analyst conversation with Michael or Himank."

        "title": "Climate fights at European court may ripple across the globe - E&E News by POLITICO",
        "content": "A high-ranking international human rights court that only hears cases that raise a \u201cserious question\u201d will consider three challenges beginning this week that accuse European governments of not doing enough to curb greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 the first such lawsuits to be reviewed by the powerful bench.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, could order governments to speed up efforts to cut carbon dioxide \u2014 a judgment that would only bind the nations named in the lawsuits. But such a ruling could open the door to similar challenges in other countries and set precedent for determining whether government officials\u2019 failure to act on climate change violates human rights.\n\nRamifications of a decision of that nature could even reach the United States, said Pat Parenteau, an emeritus professor at Vermont Law and Graduate School.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEurope is still a major market for American companies, and things that happen in Europe have ripple effects,\u201d Parenteau said. He noted that a landmark 2021 ruling from a court in the Netherlands finding that Shell PLC must slash its greenhouse gas emissions could \u201caffect the world\u201d because the company has holdings across the globe.\n\n\u201cThings that are happening in Europe will have indirect effects on our policies,\u201d he said.\n\nParenteau said the European Court of Human Rights\u2019 interest in the climate cases comes as jurists in Europe, Latin America and Africa are beginning to recognize a right to a healthy environment.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing law emerging in other parts of the world, and you\u2019ve got to believe that U.S. courts at some point are going to take note of that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe European court\u2019s first case, to be heard Wednesday, focuses on the health effects of heat waves fueled by climate change. In Union of Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection v. Swiss Federal Council, a group of older women say they\u2019re disproportionately hurt by their government\u2019s failure to do enough to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe second case, Car\u00eame v. France, was brought by the former mayor of a town near Dunkirk who says the nation has failed to take every appropriate measure to reduce emissions.\n\nA third case, filed by six young people in Portugal, will be heard later this summer. In Duarte Agostinho v. Portugal and 32 Other States, the youths accuse 33 nations of jeopardizing the next generation by not acting decisively to address global warming.\n\nSimilar lawsuits brought by young people in the United States have struggled to gain traction. A lawsuit filed against the federal government was rejected by an appeals court in 2020 and is now awaiting revision in a lower bench. Judges in several states, including Alaska and Utah, have also found that similar youth climate lawsuits raise issues that should be resolved by legislators.\n\nOne case, however, Held v. State of Montana, may soon be the first youth-led climate case to go to trial in a U.S. court ( Climatewire , Dec. 1, 2022).\n\n\u201cAs a court mandated to confront human rights violations head on, the importance of the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgments in these historic cases addressing the single greatest threat to human rights cannot be overstated,\u201d two attorneys and a scientist for Our Children\u2019s Trust \u2014 the Oregon-based law firm behind many of the U.S. youth climate cases \u2014 wrote for Strasbourg Observers, a blog that covers the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe court\u2019s grand chamber, composed of 17 judges, only hears a select number of cases, and its findings cannot be appealed.\n\nHuman rights-based climate cases have been galvanized by a 2019 decision, State of the Netherlands v. Urgenda Foundation, in which Dutch judges found that government leaders had a legal duty to take stronger climate action to protect human rights.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights in late 2020 took the unusual step of fast-tracking Portugal\u2019s Duarte case. The Global Legal Action Network, the British nonprofit that represents the young challengers, said the move reflects the \u201cimportance and urgency of the issues\u201d at the heart of the dispute.\n\nPotential hurdles\n\nObservers say the three cases that are currently before the European Court of Human Rights raise a number of obstacles for the bench.\n\nAll three lawsuits charge officials with not moving aggressively enough on climate change, but human rights challenges have traditionally focused on government action \u2014 rather than inaction, said Ankita Gupta, a Toronto-based associate at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP.\n\nSpeaking last week at a workshop on the cases hosted by Columbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, Gupta suggested it may be easier for parties to argue that a government action has violated human rights.\n\n\u201cThe challenge when you argue that it is inaction, is a risk of a court finding that is creating an obligation for the government\u201d to act, she said. Such a finding, she added, could raise questions about separation of powers.\n\nArmando Rocha, an assistant professor at the Lisbon School of Law at the Catholic University of Portugal, said the Duarte case has the potential to deliver a landmark decision, but he suggested that the challenge has \u201cstructural deficiencies.\u201d\n\nThe youths will need to demonstrate a link between emissions and climate change, Rocha said at the same Columbia event, calling the connection \u201cclear and undisputed, but from a legal angle also very much distant.\u201d He said that may be especially true for some of the claims in the case, including that the youth are suffering from allergies and sleep disruption that is worsened by rising temperatures.\n\nThe young litigants must also get over a legal hurdle that often requires parties to first pursue solutions outside of the courts, Rocha said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve invoked the urgency of climate change and as members of a younger generation with less resources and tools,\u201d he said of the Duarte challengers. \u201cCan age and urgency qualify as an exception to the rule that they must first exhaust domestic remedies?\u201d\n\nYoung challengers in the case will likely argue that if they were required to wait for the 33 countries named in the lawsuit to act, \u201cwe will be at the end of the century, and the problem of climate change calls for a different approach,\u201d Luc Lavrysen, a justice of the Constitutional Court of Belgium and an environmental law professor at Ghent University, said at the Columbia event.\n\nBut to demonstrate legal standing, the challengers will have to show \u201creasonable and convincing evidence that the likelihood of a harm will occur,\u201d Lavrysen said. \u201cMere suspicion or conjecture is insufficient.\u201d\n\nCorina Heri, a postdoctoral researcher in the Climate Rights and Remedies Project at the University of Zurich, said the court has the power to decide whether failure to mitigate climate change violates human rights, but it\u2019s unclear whether it will do so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relatively sure that the court won\u2019t sit down and rewrite domestic climate laws, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t offer redress,\u201d she said at the Columbia event. Most significantly, she said, the court could issue a declaratory judgment, finding that a violation took place.\n\n\u201cEven if none of that happens and it\u2019s just a finding they are admissible, it would be a success,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would send a signal that the court is willing to hear these cases.\u201d\n\nFirst up: Switzerland\n\nThe Swiss challengers, who plan to take a train to Strasbourg for the Wednesday hearing at the European Court of Human Rights, first filed suit in 2016, alleging that various federal agencies had failed to uphold their obligations under the Swiss Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe suits failed in Switzerland, but in Strasbourg, the women plan to argue that the nation has breached two articles of the European Convention that protect the right to life and the \u201cright to a normal private and family life.\u201d\n\nThe Swiss government has argued that it has \u201clong recognized\u201d global warming and is committed to fighting it.\n\nBut government officials told the court that the Swiss challengers have failed to prove a causal link between the country\u2019s \u201calleged omissions\u201d and the effects of heat waves.\n\nThey said the Swiss government believes that \u201cglobal warming is a global phenomenon and that only resolute action by all states, combined with changes in behavior by private actors and all citizens, will enable us to find lasting solutions to this immense challenge.\u201d"

        "title": "Remembering track coach Tony Glover \u2014 and the ripple effect of his life - Deseret News",
        "content": "Beloved track coach Tony Glover died Sunday, March 26, 2023. The outpouring of love from his former athletes speaks volumes about the difference he made in their lives.\n\nThe last time I saw Tony Glover he was walking slowly across the parking lot through the falling snow to the track stadium at Corner Canyon High, where a workout was planned for the school team. When he arrived at the stadium, he leaned against a wall and spoke quietly, slowly and laboriously. His usual sparkle was gone.\n\n\u201cFor me, Tony is the role model every child needs. He is the epitome of what I want every athlete to experience at some point in their lives \u2014 a great friend, a mentor, a coach, a positive person.\u201d \u2014 Toni Hansen\n\nTony, who was an event coach for the school track team (as am I), had caught COVID-19 a year ago and ever since then he had had difficulty breathing, his blood oxygen levels dropping dangerously low at times. He required bottled oxygen much of the time and was hospitalized several times. He told us he had nearly died a couple of times. He had had another relapse the previous day, his temperature rising to 103.5. As we stood in a room underneath the stadium, waiting out the snow, I asked him the obvious question.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here? Why aren\u2019t you resting at home?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be here than at home sitting around,\u201d he said.\n\nAnyone who knows Tony knows that he was there because he loved it. Loved coaching. Loved the nuances of technique. Loved the sport. Loved the kids above all. Loved all of it so much that he showed up for practice even though he was so sick and weak. Before our encounter in the stadium he had been seen sitting in his truck in the parking lot, slumped against the center console with fatigue.\n\nLittle did any of us know it was the last time we would see him. Three days later he was dead.\n\nHe died Sunday evening.\n\nThe news spread like wildfire on the internet. That\u2019s because Tony \u2014 that\u2019s all anybody ever called him \u2014 had coached thousands of kids for some three decades. He coached kids through the Mercury Track Club he founded. He coached at clinics on summer mornings. He coached kids at the Olympic Oval in the winter. He coached at several high schools around the state on spring afternoons.\n\nThere was hardly an athlete in the sport who hadn\u2019t been touched by him in some way. Coaching wasn\u2019t his job \u2014 he owned a company that installed temporary power at construction sites and did the work himself \u2014 but it was his passion, his raison d\u2019etre.\n\n\u201cThe ripples will be felt far and wide with the passing of Tony,\u201d said Cal Beck, a fellow coach and former standout track athlete.\n\nOne of those ripples reached Kylie Hirschi Ross, who was introduced to track by Tony and his club in the seventh grade and went on to become a state champion and all-conference collegian. \u201cI was just scrolling through his Facebook account back to 2010 and it was interesting to see how many of the athletes wrote that he was like a second father to them. That\u2019s who he was. He made these kids feel so important. Kids can be so awkward and he could get through to them. He was so influential to so many kids.\u201d\n\nHours after Tony passed away, I received an email from a friend: \u201cHe practically raised my wife and has been at pretty much every milestone in our marriage.\u201d\n\nIt was always about the kids. Toni Hansen, the unofficial team mom of the Mercury club, recalls that when she went to Tony\u2019s home she frequently saw \u201ca random teenager or two living there. They were having a hard time with their parents or their lives. Tony would say, \u2018You can stay with me.\u2019 And he didn\u2019t have a lot of money. He would struggle personally to provide for the kids.\u201d\n\nJen Fitzgerald, who refers to herself as Tony\u2019s secretary in the Utah USA Track and Field organization (where he served as youth chair), recalls, \u201cHe was like an uncle to my kids and a dad to everyone who didn\u2019t have one. He\u2019d take in kids off the street and take them into his home. He always had someone living with him who wasn\u2019t family. He\u2019d find them jobs. He\u2019d get shoes for kids who didn\u2019t have them. He made sure they had a way to compete. He showed up to everything. He was just the best man; he always made you smile. He wanted everyone to be happy. He pushed through his own stuff and loved the kids.\u201d\n\nThere was the rub: Tony had a lot of \u201cstuff\u201d to push through. He was always pleasant, warm and humorous, but it belied a life filled with tragedy. Over the years he lost four children \u2014 his twins died in an accident many years ago, then his pregnant daughter died a few years ago (the baby survived) and one of his sons died in an automobile accident last August (Tony was babysitting his children at the time).\n\nSometimes Tony would tear open those wounds at the track, providing a fleeting glimpse of the grief he carried. \u201cNobody should have to go through this four times,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cI outlived four of my children.\u201d\n\nHansen, the team mom for Mercury, noted, \u201cThe kids kept him going. A day or two after (his son) passed away, he showed up at track practice. It\u2019s where he wanted to be. It made him feel whole, giving back to these kids.\u201d\n\nTony was well known but not known well. Many of his fellow coaches were uncertain about his background or even his age. He was 64 years old, but looked younger. He was raised in California. He said he competed in college track and field. He and his wife Jeanette had seven children together and three of them are alive, although there are others who claim him as a father by dint of his influence and care for them.\n\n\u201cHe is that person you want in your child\u2019s life,\u201d says Hansen, who had three children on the Mercury team.\n\nHansen is a school teacher. She went to school on Monday morning, about 12 hours after learning of Tony\u2019s passing, \u201cbecause Tony would\u2019ve wanted it.\u201d Between classes she talked about Tony through her tears.\n\n\u201cFor me, Tony is the role model every child needs,\u201d she begins. \u201cHe is the epitome of what I want every athlete to experience at some point in their lives \u2014 a great friend, a mentor, a coach, a positive person. He was a role model who made me want to be a better person, a better teacher, a better parent. Everything. He was there to build you up. He was so kind and caring and funny and knew how to motivate.\u201d\n\nShe witnessed many kids who came to the club with depression and other mental illnesses who were healed by their experience there. \u201cSo many of them said that if not for Tony they probably would\u2019ve taken their own lives,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cThat was the impact he had.\u201d\n\nSome people in the community called to contribute to this story when they heard it was in the works. They were eager to talk about Tony. Carl Wimmer, the former Utah State representative, wrote to say that Tony had helped his daughter become a track star when no other help was available in central Utah. This led Wimmer himself to form his own track club and youth program. He is now a track coach at Duchesne High School.\n\nDoug Padilla, the former Olympic distance runner, sent an email praising Tony for his work with youth and noted that three days before Tony died he sent him a message apologizing for his late response, explaining that he was in the hospital with \u201cRSV and something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis personal health has been a challenge for some time now,\u201d wrote Padilla. \u201cYet, he would maintain his good spirit and work effort through it all.\u201d\n\nMany coaches embrace potential star athletes because, as Hansen put it, \u201cthey want to be part of the success,\u201d but she noted that Tony went out of his way to nurture the less talented, as well. Roland Tolbert, another fixture in the youth track community who coaches the Cheetah track club, said the same thing. \u201cHe cared about each kid he trained, even the kids who weren\u2019t talented. He\u2019d help them develop and have success. Every kid can have success. We\u2019d sit by the long jump pit talking about kids and it was not about superstars. He\u2019d take a kid who was not talented and help him have success.\u201d\n\nTolbert continued, \u201cTony\u2019s a good guy who meant a lot to kids and the sport and to the community. Losing someone like that in our world is tough.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Those who would like to donate to Tony Glover\u2019s family, here is a link to a GoFundMe account that has been set up for the family.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held Friday, March 31, from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p. m. at 3103 E Craig Drive, Salt Lake City, 84109. A funeral service will be held Saturday, April 1, at 12:30 p.m. at the same location."
