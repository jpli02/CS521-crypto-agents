        "title": "Ripple (XRP) May Have Won a Partial Win Against the SEC But at What Cost? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ripple\u2019s case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission is perhaps the most important lawsuit for the cryptocurrency industry, or at least ranking high up that list.\n\nThe company scored a major win against the Commission earlier this year, but at what cost?\n\nRipple\u2019s Partial Victory v. SEC\n\nBack in July, the presiding judge, Analisa Torres, ruled that secondary sales of XRP didn\u2019t constitute an investment contract.\n\nWhat this meant for Ripple was, essentially, that they could continue selling XRP to the public without the fear of prosecution. Of course, the SEC is currently appealing this decision, and we have yet to see the outcome of the case, but the news was largely perceived as positive.\n\nAn added benefit was that a lot of the major exchanges, which had previously delisted XRP under fear of the outcome of the lawsuit, re-listed it for trading following the ruling.\n\nThis led to a huge spike in demand for XRP, doubling its price overnight.\n\nBut What\u2019s the Cost?\n\nThere are two sides to this story. CryptoPotato reported earlier in August on the thoughts of John Deaton \u2013 a well-known pro-Ripple attorney who represents tens of thousands of XRP holders \u2013 on the damage that the case has done to the company already.\n\nHe alleged that the case has greatly hurt XRP\u2019s adoption, among a myriad of other negative consequences.\n\nBut there\u2019s a literal cost of this lawsuit for Ripple.\n\nMost recently, Fortune reported that the legal bills for the company have racked up to a whopping $200 million.\n\nAt the recent Mainnet conference in the US, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that \u201cyou have to stand up to a bully,\u201d but apparently, the price of standing up amounts to almost a quarter of a billion dollars. That\u2019s a lot of money. It\u2019s money that the company could have spent on development, talent acquisition, or any other activity that may have helped the industry as a whole.\n\nAlthough, there\u2019s a case to be made that Ripple\u2019s spending on this case is a positive for the industry if the company wins."

        "content": "In a recent development, attorney Bill Morgan and securities law specialist Marc Fagel delved into the legal saga between the SEC and Binance, shedding light on a critical aspect of the ongoing legal battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorgan's commentary was prompted by a mention of the SEC's ongoing case against Ripple in the codefendants' legal memorandum filed in support of Binance's motion to dismiss the SEC's complaint. These codefendants, represented by BAM, Binance's partners, appear to be leveraging Judge Torres' previous opinion concerning transactions on secondary exchanges. Recall that, in SEC v. Ripple, the court ruled that secondary sales of XRP did not constitute unregistered sales of securities.\n\nExtract referring to the Ripple case. The BAM defendants seek to rely on the finding of Judge Torres in respect of blind/bid type transactions on secondary exchanges. What if this Court on this motion accepts or does not critcise Judge Torres' decision on programmatic sales? /2 pic.twitter.com/5q33M4nHbn \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) September 22, 2023\n\nThe pivotal question raised by Morgan is whether the court would endorse Judge Torres' stance on programmatic sales. This query leads to speculation about why the SEC pursued an interlocutory appeal against the Torres decision in the Ripple lawsuit.\n\nThe concern appears to stem from the possibility that this decision could be employed not only by Binance but also by other defendants facing similar charges, as such secondary sales are commonly used by various exchanges and sellers.\n\nIn response to Morgan's musings, Marc Fagel, a securities law specialist and former regional director of the SEC, offered insight into the regulator's motivation for seeking an appeal. Fagel explained that the decision to pursue an appeal was driven by the broader implications it holds for the regulatory body's stance on crypto exchanges. He emphasized that the appeal was not merely about Ripple but about safeguarding the SEC's overarching strategy against the crypto industry."

        "title": "Attorneys Criticize SEC Chair Following Comments Relating To Ripple Case | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In a recent development, pro-XRP legal experts Bill Morgan and John Deaton have taken a swipe at the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler following his recent comments, which show his stance on the Ripple Case.\n\nRipple Case: Gensler a \u201cMegalomaniac\u201d\n\nIn a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Deaton criticized Gensler\u2019s supposed disregard for the court, including the Supreme Court. He says people like Gensler \u201care inherently arrogant\u201d and think \u201cthey are above the law.\u201d He further labeled the SEC Chair a \u201creal life example of a megalomaniac.\u201d\n\nHis tweet was in response to an interview where Gensler was quizzed as to whether or not anything \u201cany court\u201d will say will change his perception of the crypto space and, by extension, cryptocurrencies. Instead of answering the question, Gensler seemed to deflect and stated that he wished a court could say something to speed up compliance in the industry.\n\nHis comments about the court come at a time when the SEC is involved in an ongoing legal battle against Ripple, a case that could determine whether crypto tokens are indeed securities.\n\nGoing by this, it would seem that Gensler is hell-bent on getting a court decision that will support his notion that cryptocurrencies are securities and should be guided by the securities laws rather than being guided by the court on whether or not cryptocurrencies fall under the SEC\u2019s purview in the first place.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Morgan further dissected Gensler\u2019s comments. He stated that Gensler meant that he wished the Commission had \u201cwon the part of the Ripple case that matters most\u201d and that since they didn\u2019t, he is hoping that an Appeal court can reverse Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 ruling.\n\nHe joked that Genlser would be hoping this happens so they can have their own party in New York, most likely in reference to Ripple\u2019s announcement that it would have a party in New York on September 29 to celebrate its victory against the SEC.\n\nSecurities Laws Should Apply To Crypto Industry\n\nIn that same interview, Gensler mentioned that securities laws should apply to \u201ccrypto security tokens.\u201d According to him, there is nothing \u201cincompatible\u201d between those tokens and the securities laws, suggesting that there is no reason why they shouldn\u2019t be tagged as securities.\n\nHe further stated that investors have much to gain from these tokens being regulated by the securities laws, including the fact they will be protected from fraud and manipulation. He alluded to the fact that many, hoping for a better future, have lost their money to crypto investments.\n\nThe SEC and Gensler hope to use the Ripple case to prove that crypto tokens are indeed securities and should be guided by the securities laws. Their interlocutory appeal against Judge Torres\u2019 ruling is focused on the Judge\u2019s decision on Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales and other distributions, as she stated that they didn\u2019t constitute investment contracts.\n\nIf the appeal goes in the SEC\u2019s favor, the Commission will gain momentum to forge ahead in its enforcement actions. It will also provide a leeway for it to enforce actions against all crypto exchanges for operating as unregistered securities exchanges, just like it already did with Binance and Coinbase.\n\nXRP token fights off bears above $0.5 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Bitcoinist, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "Lowell \u2014 Lowell High School cross-country team co-captain Paul Fowler sees the impact a simple gesture, like serving spaghetti, breadsticks and desserts, can have on people touched by cancer.\n\nPaul, a junior, joined his team in dishing out a hearty meal to Gilda\u2019s Club members during Supper Together Tuesday evening. Twice a month, student athletes serve food at the organization\u2019s Lowell Clubhouse. Gilda\u2019s Club is a free emotional health support community for people impacted by cancer or grieving a death due to any cause.\n\nPaul said he is glad his team is stepping up.\n\n\u201cIt helps the community know people our age care and want to help out,\u201d he said.\n\nLowell students have always heard the message that everyone can make a difference, thanks to a signature fall event that turns the high school football field into a sea of pink.\n\n\u201cBefore Lowell started playing for a cause, no one played for a cause.\u201d \u2013 Pink Arrow Pride spokesperson Teresa Beachum\n\nPink Arrow Pride has raised money to support Lowell families who are affected by cancer for the past 16 years. Its ripple effects are found in efforts throughout the community, such as students serving dinner in support.\n\n\u201cWe grew up with Pink Arrow our whole lives,\u201d said junior Olivia Seevers, who served pasta at Supper Together alongside her twin sister and teammate Lauren.\n\nUniting for a Cause\n\nStarted by former Lowell High School football coach Neal Dean and dedicated volunteers in 2008, the Pink Arrow event is when the Lowell Red Arrows football team dons bubblegum-pink jerseys and plays for the cause. On the backs of those jerseys are names of people in their lives who have been affected by cancer.\n\nAthletes eat with Gilda\u2019s Club members (courtesy)\n\nThe tradition continues tonight, with the Pink Arrow football game at 7 p.m. against Greenville at Lowell High School.\n\nTeresa Beachum, an original volunteer with her husband, Perry, said Pink Arrow began because Dean wanted to start a game for a cause. He and other volunteers chose cancer, and pink was the color most associated with the disease.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before it became more than a football game. The cross-country, soccer and volleyball teams got involved. Area businesses contributed. The community united around Pink Arrow and it raised $93,000 in its first year. It continues to raise a minimum of $100,000 each year with proceeds distributed among Gilda\u2019s Club Lowell, the Dr. Gerard and Kathy Talus scholarships and contributions to individual families.\n\nThe inaugural event also ignited a spark that has spread throughout Michigan.\n\nThe Red Arrows turn pink for a cause (courtesy)\n\n\u201cBefore Lowell started playing for a cause, no one played for a cause,\u201d Beachum said. \u201cThis was a new phenomenon and a new teachable moment that our coaches felt they wanted to impact their student athletes with.\u201d\n\nDuring its first few years, the district received inquiries about how Lowell got their game started. The district held a daylong seminar and 200 people attended from across the state to learn how to start their own programs.\n\nIn 2009 the community met its goal of raising money toward renovating a building that would become the home to the Gilda\u2019s Club Lowell Clubhouse as another way to support local families.\n\n\u201cThis community keeps supporting this cause,\u201d Beachum said. \u201cOur small town, they walk the walk.\u201d\n\nRead more from Lowell:\n\n\u2022 \u2018My days just fly by\u2019\n\n\u2022 Another year of practice, perform, perfect"
