        "title": "'Elemental' Features Pixar's First Nonbinary Character, a Lake Who Wears Earrings - Them",
        "content": "Disney has a habit of boasting about LGBTQ+ inclusion onscreen, only for its canonically queer characters to show up for a hot second or barely mention their identity at all. Who could forget the cyclops cop in Onward who dropped a quick shoutout to her girlfriend? Or what about \u201cGrieving Man,\u201d the iconic Avengers: Endgame\u2019s character who offhandedly mentioned going on gay date in Marvel\u2019s big \u201cexclusively gay moment\u201d?\n\nWell, this Pride month, another queer Disney character is making headlines, albeit for heralding an actual milestone. Elemental features Pixar\u2019s first-ever nonbinary character, voiced by nonbinary actor Ava Kai Hauser.\n\nThe movie, released in theaters June 16, takes place in a world where the four elements are embodied as living beings, borrowing from the tradition of Inside Out and Zootopia in creating anthropomorphized characters to tell a story that\u2019s obliquely about social issues.\n\nWhile the main plot centers on the girl-meets-boy star-crossed connection between the fiery Ember Lumen (Leah Lewis) and watery Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie), Hauser voices Wade\u2019s younger sibling, a fellow water element named Lake Ripple. A side character among the extended Ripple extended family, Lake uses they/them pronouns and is often accompanied by a partner they met in art school (where else?).\n\nAll cynicism aside, it\u2019s always nice to see queer and trans actors getting their flowers. Hauser shared their casting on Twitter, writing, \u201cBIG ANNOUNCEMENT I got to play Pixar\u2019s first nonbinary character! Meet Lake! I voice Lake in the new movie #Elemental! I\u2019m seeing it in theaters tonight with my friends, so you can catch it in theaters too if you wanna see them.\u201d"

        "title": "Ripple vs SEC: An industry insider predicts the regulator's victory - - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Tue 20 Jun 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C.\n\nOver the past few months, many analysts have predicted that Ripple would win its case against the SEC. However, it now seems that this prediction is about to change. Could the recent disappointing revelations about the Hinman documents be turning the tide?\n\nPrometheum founder says Ripple will lose to the SEC\n\nDoes Ripple still have a chance of winning its case against the SEC? Aaron Kaplan, founder of crypto firm Prometheum, thinks it is unlikely. Speaking on the matter, the CEO made it clear that he rather sees the SEC as the winner of this legal battle.\n\n\u201cI anticipate the SEC will win this case [against Ripple, ed.] as every indication points to a decision in the commission\u2019s favor.\u201d Kaplan said during his recent appearance on Daily Drop.\n\nThis statement is by far the first to be made against Ripple. However, over the past few months, the idea of a potential victory for the company had been widely circulated within the crypto industry.\n\nThis perspective was notably based on data from the Hinman documents, whose recent disclosure was quite disappointing for the industry. One might therefore assume that Kaplan\u2019s projections are in line with these documents. However, this is not the case.\n\nAaron Kaplan\u2019s belief that the SEC will win his case is based on a previous case: SEC vs LBRY. This case, which pitted open source content distributor LBRY against the SEC, went in the latter\u2019s favor.\n\nThe reason for this decision was that the court ultimately ruled that LBRY did not comply with securities regulations. According to the CEO\u2019s thinking, Ripple should suffer the same fate, as the two cases share similarities.\n\nInconsistent projections?\n\nThis reasoning has caused quite a stir in the crypto community. Many users considered this approach both irrelevant and a tad biased. This makes sense, since Aaron Kaplan is particularly supportive of regulators\u2019 policies.\n\n\u201cVery odd. Nothing about the cases he cited nor even the Hinman speech itself or the warnings he got from the SEC staff about the speech support the notion that the token is a security\u201d, legal news outlet CryptoLaw criticized.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "A ripple effect: Leadership experience creates lasting impact among Black professionals - The Daily | Case Western Reserve University",
        "content": "When Churyl Croone first learned about Weatherhead School of Management\u2019s new Executive Leadership Development Experience (ELDE)\u2014which aims to grow the leadership capabilities of participants, especially Black professionals\u2014she knew she had to be involved.\n\nDuring her time in the cohort-based Executive Education program, which began in February and will come to a close later this month, Croone, senior director of business development and industry engagement at Case School of Engineering, said she\u2019s felt a wide range of emotions.\n\n\u201cTypically when you are in mid-management [or] senior-level management, you look around the room and you are the only [Black or brown person] or one of [the only ones],\u201d she explained. \u201cTo look at a room and see lawyers, doctors, [vice presidents], senior directors\u2014it\u2019s just so wonderful and reaffirming that we\u2019re not the only ones in these spaces.\u201d\n\nCroone has especially appreciated the program\u2019s networking receptions and aspects related to executive coaching and mentoring. Each member of the ELDE program is matched with both an executive coach from the Weatherhead School and a mentor in the Northeast Ohio community to provide them with support and advice. Croone\u2019s mentor is Annette Blackwell, mayor of the City of Maple Heights.\n\n\u201dWe\u2019re [going to be] able to take these tools back and utilize them and also share with our families, with our friends, our coworkers\u2014it\u2019s like that pebble you put in a pond and it ripples,\u201d Croone said. \u201cThis is a good ripple. It\u2019s not going to end in June.\u201d\n\nBuilding upon Executive Education\u2019s expertise in developing bold and impactful leadership programs with lasting value, the five-month ELDE program has attracted countless experts to share their insights. Panelists at networking events have included:\n\nAlan Nevel, senior vice president, chief equity officer, MetroHealth Systems\n\nYentil Rawlinson, vice president, inclusion, equity and diversity, The Sherwin-Williams Co.\n\nRandell McShepard, vice president of public affairs, chief talent officer, RPM International\n\nElizabeth Voudouris, president and CEO, Business Volunteers Unlimited\n\nJakki Nance, CEO, Philanthropic Solutions\n\nArica Steed, president and CEO, MetroHealth Systems\n\nNancy Mendez, president and CEO, Starting Point\n\nKevin Martin, president and CEO, ideastream\n\nMarsha Mockabee, president, The Urban League of Greater Cleveland\n\nWesley Gillespie, regional president, ErieBank\n\nMelvin Smith, professor in the Department of Organizational Behavior and faculty director of Executive Education, said one of the program\u2019s goals is to further build the pipeline of Black leadership in Northeast Ohio and to connect participants to senior Black leaders in the region, such as the panelists above.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe wondered just how much of a need there really was for something like this, and we felt there was a need,\u201d Smith noted. \u201cBut the most gratifying thing has been hearing the comments from participants about how meaningful this experience has been for them so far, how they\u2019re so grateful we decided to do this and how much they\u2019re taking away from it.\u201d\n\nFor DJuan McCarthy, another participant in the inaugural cohort, the program encouraged him to be his most authentic self.\n\n\u201cI look at this group of people similar to the group as I had growing up, my grade school friends\u2014I still have [those] friends,\u201d said McCarthy, who works in operations at RPM International Inc. \u201cThere\u2019s conversations that I have that are similar to those\u2014professional conversations, life conversations, all of those. I look at this group as that next phase, another circle that I can be in that\u2019s supportive and that will drive me to further grow.\u201d\n\nThe program has also received support from corporate and community sponsors including, RPM International, Eaton Corporation, Progressive Insurance, The J.M. Smucker Co., The MetroHealth System, The George Gund Foundation, Case Western Reserve University Office of the Provost, Randell McShepard and Dr. Andre Mickel.\n\nLearn more about the Executive Leadership Development Experience and request information about the next cohort, which will begin in February."

        "title": "The housing crisis' economic toll: The damaging ripple impact from a lack of affordable homes - New York Daily News",
        "content": "A certain conventional wisdom has taken hold that New York and other big cities like San Francisco, which were hard-hit by the pandemic, are in danger of an \u201curban doom loop\u201d in which hollowed out downtowns, falling tax receipts, flight of jobs and residents, and rising crime and homelessness spell a 1970s-style urban implosion.\n\nCertainly, there are major challenges in closing budget shortfalls, finding new uses for empty office buildings, filling vacant storefronts, and ensuring that public transportation is maintained as the lifeblood of the urban circulation system. But none of these are the biggest threat to the city\u2019s future. In fact, Census data show New York and other hard-hit cities are on the rebound. Population losses slowed last year, foreign immigration is up, employment now exceeds pre-pandemic highs, and wages are growing at a healthy clip.\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul presents her Fiscal Year 2024 Executive Budget proposal in the Red Room at the State Capitol.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t reviving the city \u2014 it\u2019s making room for the people that want to be here, including the desire for more space as people work from home and want the privacy that comes with living apart from parents and roommates.\n\nIn the battles now being fought (and lost) in Albany to make it easier to convert office buildings to housing, ease unnecessary regulations on construction, renew a tax break for affordable housing, and allow denser residential development, the debate revolves around housing affordability and renter protections.\n\nBut despite the arguments reflecting the pain of millions of New Yorkers as they search for a place to live and try to figure out how to pay, Albany did nothing. But there are also bigger stakes that affect everyone, including homeowners preoccupied with protecting \u201cneighborhood character\u201d who block zoning reform.\n\nThe bigger stakes are simply this: housing scarcity short-circuits the city, state, and national economies. We saw the underlying dynamic during the pandemic and for decades before. Housing shortfalls drive up housing costs and force households and jobs outward from the metropolitan core to the far reaches of suburbia, and from bigger cities and metro areas to smaller and cheaper ones.\n\nThe result is that big cities and in particular their now-exorbitantly expensive close-in residential neighborhoods are home to far fewer people and jobs than in years past. In New York, the neighborhoods with the best access to Manhattan jobs grew 22% in population since 1980, but still have 10% fewer residents than in 1950. The same is true across most of the nation\u2019s largest and fastest-growing cities.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, it looked like remote work would change all this, that people could live wherever they wanted and still have the well-paying job and professional opportunities that pre-pandemic required shelling out for excessive housing costs. That turned out to be largely a mirage as hybrid work arrangements requiring a few days in the office each week prevailed over all-remote work arrangements.\n\nMoreover, those who moved out of the metro area have been quickly replaced by often younger workers who want the career opportunities built on face-to-face engagement together with the museums, theater, opera, dance, jazz clubs, art galleries, bars and restaurants found most prolifically in the city core. The pandemic changed how many times people go into the office \u2014 but not the importance of meeting in person, nor the attraction of rich cultural and culinary surroundings.\n\nFailure to meet the desire for city living is immensely costly, not just to those priced out of the city but to the city, state and nation as a whole. That\u2019s because the most innovative and economically productive metros are the ones with the biggest downtown business districts and the most people living near their well-paying jobs.\n\nHow much? In a new report being published today, I\u2019ve calculated that limits on growth from housing scarcity reduces total economic output of the New York region by $225 billion annually. Using data for the 25 largest metros and another ten up-and-coming metros like Austin, Charlotte, and Nashville, I\u2019ve estimated the reduction in economic output comes to $1.22 trillion annually. That\u2019s 12.3% of the gross domestic product of these 35 metros, and 5.7% of the economic output of the nation as a whole.\n\nAt a time of possible recession, rising state and city budget deficits, spiraling federal debt, and cumulating costs from climate change, that\u2019s a lot of money to leave on the table. Fixing the housing crisis in New York and the nation\u2019s other biggest cities, especially in the metropolitan center, is the key to unlocking this economic jackpot.\n\nSchaller is the former deputy commissioner of traffic and planning at the New York City Department of Transportation and author of \u201cBoom Times or Doom Loop? America\u2019s Urban Future, Post-Pandemic.\u201d"

        "title": "The Ripple Effect: How the impact of the historic St. Augustine 'Swim-In' still echoes today - WJXT News4JAX",
        "content": "ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. \u2013 News4JAX continues our deep dive into the psychological barriers that still exist among the Black community to learning to swim after decades of racism and a history of segregation surrounding swimming pools.\n\nAfter taking a close look at two tragedies that emphasize the high drowning rates among the Black community, we now turn our attention to a local incident that helped bring an end to the very segregation at the root of these deep-seated issues.\n\nA week after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested for trying to eat a meal at the Monson Motor Lodge in St. Augustine in 1964, his supporters were inspired to perform their own act of peaceful protest.\n\nHistorian David Nolan said it all started with a meeting inside a Bridge Street dentist office, owned by St. Augustine civil rights leader Dr. Robert Hayling.\n\nRELATED: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. joined push to end racial discrimination in nation\u2019s oldest city\n\nKing had called St. Augustine -- the nation\u2019s oldest city -- a \u201clawless city\u201d as he led demonstrations through the segregated South.\n\nSt. Augustine is best known as the nation's oldest city -- but in 1964 -- Martin Luther King Junior called it the most lawless city he had seen.\n\n\u201cPeople said, \u2018Well, you know the Monson Motel,\u2019 which had been the focal point for these demonstrations, \u2018it has this small swimming pool. Why don\u2019t we have a swim-in?\u2019\u201d Nolan said.\n\nThey had no idea that what would happen during that \u201cswim-in\u201d would shake the country to its core and lead to nationwide change.\n\nHistoric \u2018swim-in\u2019\n\nWhen the Black and white swimmers jumped in together and integrated the St. Augustine motel\u2019s pool, Monson Motor Lodge owner James Brock was so enraged he grabbed a bottle of acid and threw it into the pool.\n\nJT Johnson vividly remembers being in the water.\n\n\u201cThey beat us up pretty bad down there. We had never been in a situation like that,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd that didn\u2019t get us out of the pool.\u201d\n\nThursday marks 56 years since the Monson Motor Lodge Incident in St. Augustine.\n\nJohnson, knowing that the acid was used as a pool cleaner, remembers calming the group.\n\nRELATED: 50 years later: Monson Motor Lodge incident\n\n\u201cI wanted to assure them that they were going to be alright. And they started to relax a little,\u201d Johnson said, adding that eventually, two or three sheriffs jumped in and dragged the protesters out.\n\nBut not before photographers captured images of the protesters screaming in fear and pain as Brock poured the acid into the water.\n\nOne iconic image from that swim-in shows the late Mimi Jones screaming from the fumes of the acid and Brenda Darten in the water with her, visibly shaken.\n\nRELATED: Activist Mimi Jones, captured in famous civil rights image, dies at 73\n\nDarten\u2019s daughter, Cheryl Jones, recently came down to St. Augustine from Atlanta to see for the first time where the old pool used to be.\n\n\u201cI know my mom is happy that I\u2019m here,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI was a little angry earlier because thinking about what she had to go through. Why she had to go through it because of the color of her skin.\u201d\n\nThe protesters were arrested, but the images of them in the water made headlines nationwide and ended a weeks-long filibuster, helping lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\n\u201cThis development is merely the first step in a long journey toward freedom and justice in St. Augustine,\u201d King said at the time.\n\nNo one could swim\n\nBut the turning point played by the St. Augustine swim-in protesters in the civil rights movement almost didn\u2019t happen -- because many of the demonstrators couldn\u2019t swim.\n\n\u201cAs the meeting (at the dentist\u2019s office) was breaking up, they looked around that room and realized there was not a single person there that knew how to swim,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cThere was so much tension and violence in St. Augustine at that time that they were not about to go jump in the swimming pool.\u201d\n\nMany of the demonstrators were arrested for trespassing and disorderly conduct.\n\nNolan said he knows it seems strange for those living in a coastal town not to know how to swim.\n\n\u201cThe swimming had been for whites only,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cWe had a YMCA with a swimming pool, that was for whites only at that time. We had a whole lot of motels with swimming pools. Those were for whites only.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the only pool open to Black Americans in St. Augustine was at HBCU Florida Memorial College.\n\nThomas Jackson, president of the St. Augustine Historical Society, recalled the lack of pool access as a child \u2013 and the dangerous way Black children made up for it.\n\nSwimming in large holes used for construction projects, known as borrow pits, was commonplace.\n\n\u201cEvery year, we lost somebody in the borrow pits,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey drowned. It was dangerous to swim there.\u201d\n\nNot over yet\n\nDespite the major victory for civil rights following the St. Augustine \u201cswim-in,\u201d equality in the water was far from complete.\n\nNationwide, public pools began to dwindle, and private swim clubs continued to shut out Black people.\n\nChildren\u2019s show host Fred Rogers shares a wading pool with Officer Clemmons in an episode of Mr. Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood to emphasize the importance of desegregation. (Courtesy of Fred Rogers Productions)\n\nChildren\u2019s show host Fred Rogers highlighted the issue in 1969 by sharing a wading pool with Officer Clemmons, who\u2019s Black, in an episode of Mr. Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood.\n\nIt was a simple, yet meaningful gesture aimed at breaking down the color barrier.\n\nNow, a plaque memorializing the steps where Dr. King was arrested at the Motor Lodge recognizes St. Augustine\u2019s most iconic moment in civil rights history.\n\nNearly 60 years later, a Hilton sits in place of the Monson motel -- and JT Johnson still visits occasionally.\n\n\u201cI go swimming in that pool when I go down there sometimes,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt tickles me. I just laugh about it. It\u2019s kind of funny.\u201d"
