        "title": "Underground Playlists: New Music From Emerging Talent Saint Lane, Ripple Effect Band & More - The Music",
        "content": "Saint Lane (QLD)\n\n3:33\n\nSaint Lane is a New Zealand-born, Gold Coast-based rapper who has continuously impressed us with his unique blend of indie rock, rap and hip-hop, and his newest single is no different. Cheerful and quick moving, 3:33 is a surprisingly sad song. On first listen, you're immediately whisked away by the seemingly carefree vibes, but after a while, you\u2019re confronted by the dark undertones of the song. It\u2019s extremely clever songwriting that stands leads above his peers. On the song, Saint Lane said that he attempted to make something \u201cthat blended Harry Styles & Gang of Youths,\u201d and we think he\u2019s achieved that and more.\n\nZion Garcia (NSW)\n\nPRIM PROPER FREESTYLE\n\nDon't miss a beat with our FREE daily newsletter Subscribe\n\nZion Garcia brings an attitude that is cool and confident, as per usual, but PRIM PROPER FREESTYLE is on another level - filled with funky synths, steady beats and Garcia\u2019s vocals, the single lands somewhere between D\u2019Angelo and Kendrick, with little elements of Australian rap. There is a joy and ease to Garcia\u2019s lyrics that bring you into the tiny little details of his life. You\u2019re not necessarily coming on a journey with him, but rather on a sped date session, getting to know Garcia to the maximum. Plus, the sample at the end truly makes the song.\n\nYuto. (VIC)\n\nMy Love\n\nYuto. are a Victorian duo bringing the heat with new-age vibey dance music. Coming into the spotlight with their 202 single Circles, they\u2019ve been delivering major dance hits ever since. Their newest single, My Love, continues the trend and screams summer in the best way, with danceable beats, lush vocals and thrashing synths. Think Summer by Calvin Harris but way cooler and a little more reserved. We can\u2019t wait to dance to this hit more and more as it inevitably blows up.\n\nRipple Effect Band (NT)\n\nWalaya\n\nNorthern Territory legends Ripple Effect Band are back for the first time since 2018, with a new single, Walaya, celebrating their land and their culture through the language of music that speaks to all. The all-women band have been playing music together since high school. Reflecting the multilingual nature of their hometown of Maningrida, they sing in four different Aboriginal languages as well as English. With incredible harmonies, fire bass lines and some unreal guitar riffs, these women are set to take the music industry by storm.\n\nBetty Taylor (QLD)\n\nGlitter\n\nSince their Dynamite debut single Stallin\u2019, Betty Taylor are back on the bandwagon with Glitter, a simple but cracking revenge song that leads further into their daydream indie rock vibes. Kicking off with a sparkingly guitar riff and country beats, Glitter takes the listener on a journey through heartbreak and recognition of self-worth, calling out partners who sugar-coat everything to make a relationship seem brighter (or glitterier) than it is. A little slower and more mellow than their first single, this is the perfect track to start building a massive and well-loved catalogue, which we have no doubt they will."
