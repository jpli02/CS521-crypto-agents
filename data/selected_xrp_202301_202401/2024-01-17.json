        "content": "Advertisement\n\nUtopian Lab founder Max Walker-Williams recently conducted an insightful interview with two key leaders from Ripple and Hedera.\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, and Dr. Leemon Baird, co-founder of Hedera, joined forces to discuss the future of the industry.\n\nThis meeting represents a significant development for the crypto space since it indicates the possibility of increased collaboration and unity in the burgeoning sector.\n\nUniting for a stronger crypto future\n\nDuring the interview, Walker-Williams brought together these two influential figures to talk about the potential for increased collaboration within the industry.\n\nGarlinghouse, representing Ripple, stressed the importance of such partnerships, stating, \"We gonna make sure that we start talking about whether we can collaborate as well.\"\n\nPrior to that, Baird said that he really enjoyed having conversations about tokenization on the X social media network.\n\nRipple CEO's vision in Davos\n\nIn a recent interview at Davos with CNBC, Garlinghouse shared his views on the future of the crypto industry and its regulatory challenges.\n\nGarlinghouse criticized the approach of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, saying, \"I think Gary Gensler is doing the same thing over and over again and thinks that somehow he's going to win in court.\"\n\nGarlinghouse also discussed the broader implications of current SEC policies and their impact on the U.S. economy and its global leadership in the crypto sector.\n\nHe stressed the importance of regulatory clarity, particularly for emerging technologies like stablecoins, and predicted legislative progress in the U.S. by 2024.\n\nThis view aligns with the growing consensus in the industry for the need for a balanced regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors."

        "title": "Ripple (XRP) Could Rally 1500% To $11, Here's When - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Despite lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies in 2023, several indicators suggest Ripple (XRP) is gearing up for a huge price surge to $11 or more soon.\n\nRipple gained just 17% in the last quarter of 2023, significantly underperforming top cryptos like Bitcoin and Solana. This lackluster performance raised doubts among some XRP investors about the token\u2019s potential.\n\nHowever, prominent crypto analyst EGRAG argues XRP holders should remain patient, citing technical signals that point to a massive uptrend he calls a \u201cGamma-Ray Burst\u201d (GRB).\n\nAlso read: Solana Spikes Amidst Market Volatility: How High Can SOL Go?\n\nAn energetic event could spark a 1,500% surge\n\nThe GRB concept refers to high-energy astrophysical events that release incredible amounts of gamma-ray radiation. In the crypto markets, EGRAG uses it as a metaphor for similarly explosive price moves.\n\nHe notes that XRP already experienced a GRB-like rally during the 2017 crypto bull run, skyrocketing from $0.0030 to $3.31 between January 2017 and 2018.\n\nEGRAG believes a second GRB event could drive XRP to $11 in the current cycle, representing a nearly 1,500% surge from current levels of around $0.70. However, he argues that even higher targets, like $33 and $220, are feasible as well.\n\nBullish indicators lending credence to this ultra-bullish thesis include XRP\u2019s recent golden cross, with its 12-day simple moving average moving above its 24-day SMA.\n\nWhat does Changelly say about XRP hitting $11?\n\nEGRAG\u2019s lofty forecast finds echoes from other corners of the crypto space. AI system Google Bard acknowledges that it\u2019s theoretically possible for XRP to reach double-digit territory long-term under highly favorable conditions.\n\nAlso read: Why Bitcoin is Dumping After Spot ETF Approval?\n\nSimilarly, top exchange Changelly expects Ripple XRP to eclipse the $11 milestone as early as 2031, though more realistically in the following years. Like EGRAG, Changelly points to both clearer regulations and expanding crypto adoption as tailwinds for XRP.\n\nSo despite last year\u2019s comparatively muted gains, XRP seems poised for an explosive move in 2024 and beyond."
