        "content": "A little piece of Hoosier nostalgia was up for grabs this week, but that opportunity has been put on pause.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick history lesson. Since the 1970s, a Broad Ripple train caboose \u2014 aka The Little Red Caboose \u2014 has been parked along the Monon Trail. Built in 1904, the train car was originally part of the New York Central Lakeshore Lines until the late 1960s, when it was transferred to the Monon Rail System \u2014 which is now the Monon Trail we know today.\n\nCurrently, the caboose belongs to the city, which was hoping to send it home with the highest bidder. That\u2019s because a couple of years ago, the city announced it had plans to widen the Monon Trail, but it can\u2019t proceed full steam ahead until the train is removed.\n\nThe train was up for auction until Sunday, March 30 with the most recent bid at $3,125. That is until yesterday, when an Indy Parks spokesperson said that they would halt the sale to \u201creengage stakeholders and explore additional options.\u201d We\u2019ll keep you updated as the story continues to roll forward."

        "content": "Back on schedule, caboose not departing Broad Ripple yet\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (WISH) \u2014 The City of Indianapolis is auctioning off a 118-year-old train caboose. According to a listing on govdeals.com, the caboose has been owned by the City of Indianapolis since 2020. It has plumbing, toilet and a shower. You\u2019ve probably seen it if you\u2019ve biked the Monon Trail.\n\nThe ownership and future use of the caboose has been the subject of debate and contention in recent years. The city has been trying to get the caboose off the property for several years after the previous owner stopped making lease payments.\n\nThe caboose was most recently used as a realty office, but has since sat empty. Now the city wants it gone and has put it up for auction.\n\nA write up on the auction website says, \u201cAccording to the Indianapolis Business Journal, the 118-year-old caboose has occupied a tiny parcel of city-owned land adjacent to the trail, at 6535 Cornell Ave., for a half-century. According to Waymarking.com, the caboose was built in 1904 and was part of the New York Central Lakeshore Lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe train car became part of the Monon Rail System in the late 1960s and traveled the tracks that now form the Monon Trail. During the bankruptcy in the 1970s, the train car\u2014along with another caboose that was later removed \u2014 were sidelined on a side spur in Broad Ripple. It has remained there ever since.\u201d\n\nWhile the auction is sure to attract attention for rail fans, others have questioned why the city did not ask for public comment or input.\n\nBill Malcolm of the Indiana Passenger Rail Alliance said in a statement, \u201cIPRA asks the auctioning off of the historic Monon Trail Caboose be halted. This is an appalling move by IndyParks. Especially as there was no opportunity for public comment. It should be allowed to stay next to the Monon Trail or moved by the City to a spot in Broad Ripple Park. The 108 year old Monon Railroad caboose has sat at its current location for 50 years. We ask the City to cancel the auction and hold public comment hearings on this historic treasure. We don\u2019t need more parking and there is no urgency. Using the caboose for firewood or giving it away for $3,000 is a tragedy. Shame on the City for such a surprising tone-deaf move after we had complained 2 years ago when they kicked Walsh Realty out of the caboose and promised to keep it at its current site as they had no budget to move it.\u201d\n\nIf you want to bid on this piece of history, know that you have to remove it from the property and that may involve the use of a crane.\n\nThe winning bidder will also have to remove the tracks and railroad ties.\n\nOn Thursday there were 40 bids, with a high bid of $3125.\n\nIn an afternoon statement to News 8, an Indy Parks spokesperson provided this statement: \u201cIndy Parks has decided to pause the sale of the caboose located at 6535 Cornell Ave. to reengage stakeholders and explore additional options.\u201c"

        "title": "Ripple Gains A New Ally: Messari CEO Ryan Selkis Voices Support For XRP Ledger - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Blockchain payments firm Ripple Labs has gained a new ally in the form of Messari co-founder and CEO Ryan Selkis, who recently took to Twitter to express his support for the company.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1638217129831923714\n\nDespite having been critical of Ripple in the past, Selkis now believes that the XRP-SEC case should be won by Ripple and that the XRP Ledger should be given the opportunity to compete fairly on a global scale.\n\nRipple\u2019s Potential: XRP Ledger\u2019s PoA Algorithm and IOUs\n\nIn a tweet thread by Messari, it was shared that the demand for digital payment infrastructure is increasing, despite the external pressures being applied by U.S. regulatory authorities.\n\nAccording to the tweet, the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which Ripple supports, can provide this infrastructure for individuals and existing financial entities such as central banks.\n\nOne of the unique features of the XRPL that the Messari tweet highlighted is its use of a Proof-of-Association (PoA) consensus algorithm, which requires each node to set a list of trusted nodes (UNL) that it will rely on for consensus.\n\nAll nodes on the XRPL run the same free, open-source software called \u201crippled.\u201d Validators are nodes involved in reaching consensus and voting on improvement proposals, while stock nodes receive, relay, and process transactions. Nodes rely on their UNL to finalize the state.\n\nThe thread further elaborated that the XRPL\u2019s Issued Currencies (IOUs) allow for the creation of multiple assets. While its Authorized Trust Lines enable issuers to choose which wallets can interact with their tokens. Additionally, the XRPL has a central limit order book, supporting low-liquidity IOUs.\n\nDespite facing regulatory challenges, Ripple and the XRP Ledger are making progress. Additionally, with support from industry leaders like Selkis and others, the company is poised to continue making strides toward its goal of revolutionizing the world of finance.\n\nCommunity Response To Selkis\u2019s Support Of Ripple Labs\n\nRyan Selkis\u2019 tweet in support of Ripple Labs and the XRP Ledger has garnered a lot of attention from community members. Many responded positively to Selkis\u2019 observations, with one person saying that the XRPL is impressive for so many reasons and that digital assets should have a level playing field to compete with each other. They believe that true competition will drive innovation and help grow the space.\n\nOthers expressed their appreciation for Selkis\u2019 support, with one person saying they were glad to have him on their side. Another community member pointed out that there should be no sides and that it\u2019s all of us versus the existing system.\n\nMany also acknowledged the potential of the XRPL, with one person applauding the thread and stating that it\u2019s clear that the technology is good and deserves to compete. They expressed regret that Ripple was ridiculed in the beginning instead of being supported but were glad that things were changing.\n\nRelated Reading | Cardano NFT Project Releases New Collection Featuring Snoop Dogg"

        "title": "Banks fail, causing ripple effects but what of the Turks & Caicos banking security - Magnetic Media",
        "content": "By Dana Malcolm with Deandrea Hamilton\n\nStaff Writer\n\n#TurksandCaicos, March 23, 2023 \u2013 The reputation of banking is taking a fierce hit now as some experts forecast a snowball effect for the sector with the recent collapse of three banking institutions; but the Turks and Caicos is not worried, at least not yet.\n\nWhile Magnetic Media obtained confirmation that the TCI Financial Services Commission has held a debriefing with the industry, there is confidence the fallout will not befall banks in these islands.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any effect on the Turks and Caicos but certainly it would be remiss of us if we don\u2019t monitor it,\u201d said E. Jay Saunders, Deputy Premier and TCI Minister of Finance, Investment and Trade.\n\nIn fact, he explained that the FSC which oversees the sector had already given a brief update, maintaining that the effect on the country was negligible and he believed they would continue to monitor it.\n\nIn case you\u2019d missed it, the global banking sector took a major hit last week with the collapse of three regional American banks and a mad scramble to save others costing about $318 billion, according to media reports. Now the US Treasury is taking out more even money to insure smaller banks, a strategy in order to undergird the banking system.\n\nOne Jamaican Investment banker explained the possible ripple effects of the collapse.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that it would be good for us but what would affect us is if there are any local banks that are holding bonds or securities from these institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the banks that have been collapsing overseas are not your global banks,\u201d he added.\n\nThe financer explained that these were regional banks which operated in small areas.\n\nStill when you are speaking of billions of dollars, many lean toward the collapse being quite sizable as it crossed borders with Canadians also frightened that they\u2019d lost it all in SVB\u2019s failure.\n\nSilvergate Corp went first, gutted by the upheaval of Crypto. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) fell next (making the most noise because of its proximity to the tech Eden Silicon Valley) as clients drew out their funds in a panic, leaving the bank high and dry. New York Based Signature Bank followed.\n\nFinance Minister, E Jay Saunders aimed to allay fears; reassuring the Turks and Caicos that its local banking ventures would likely be buffered from the effects.\n\n\u201cOur banks are not investment banks, they are commercial banks, and we have Canadian banks \u2013 they are very very conservative so I don\u2019t expect \u2013 Scotiabank, RBC or CIBC FirstCaribbean \u2013 for this to be affecting them in any way.\u201d\n\nSVB is not an international bank and most of the people who banked there were super high net worth businesses or venture start ups. Most of the banks here would not be looking to invest in companies like those. Where we [in the Caribbean] would have an issue is if [for example] a- JP Morgan or Citibank- got pulled in,\u201d the Jamaican explained.\n\nUS-based First Republic was saved by loans and Swiss bank Credit Suisse, bought out by a competitor UBS and thus saved by the skin of its teeth after multibillion dollar losses caused its borrowing power to dry up. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, Bank of Canada, Swiss National Bank, and the European Central Bank, had to step in, doling out loans and making currency easily available to staunch the bleed.\n\nOur Latin American neighbours say the whole debacle could push growth down to zero if it spreads to the region. This from Inter-American Development Bank Chief Economist, Eric Parrado in a March 19 annual meeting, reports Reuters.\n\nIn any eventuality, analysts say the uncertainty could slow down lending globally, making it tougher to get loans for banks and in turn residents; for the TCI that could be dismal as borrowing for natives is already sized up as a game of mastery and curry favouring."
