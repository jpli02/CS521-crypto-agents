        "title": "SEC says recent Ripple ruling could have 'substantial impact' on other court cases - Blockworks",
        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a motion to leave to file for an interlocutory appeal in its lawsuit against Ripple Labs.\n\nThe SEC argued that an interlocutory appeal in place of a traditional appeal is necessary because \u201cimmediate appellate resolution of the two rulings makes it more likely that this Court will be able to assess in one proceeding the remedies for all of the violations for which Defendants are ultimately held liable.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the SEC claimed that the rulings could have a \u201csubstantial impact on a large number of pending litigations.\u201d The SEC currently has open cases concerning securities laws against Coinbase and Binance, to name a few.\n\n\u201cThe Programmatic Sales ruling could have significant persuasive value in various pending SEC enforcement actions where issuers offered and sold crypto assets indiscriminately to public investors over crypto asset trading platforms, including cases pending in this district,\u201d the SEC said.\n\nToday\u2019s filing argues that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 which will oversee the interlocutory appeal if it is allowed to move forward \u2014 has previously overseen similar appeals to \u201cresolve important questions of securities law.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the SEC has asked the court to stay proceedings pending the motion and \u201cany forthcoming appeal.\u201d\n\nThe SEC further argues that a \u201cSecond Circuit reversal vis-\u00e0-vis the XRP offers and sales on which the Order granted Defendants summary judgment could increase the likelihood of resolving \u2018this litigation through settlement.\u2019\u201d This would therefore advance the termination of the case, while possibly preventing multiple trials.\n\nRipple Labs has until Sept. 1 to file opposition papers.\n\nThe filing comes after Judge Analisa Torres cleared a hurdle on Thursday for the SEC to request a motion to leave to file an appeal. She did not, however, approve the appeal.\n\nEarlier this week, Ripple Labs and co-defendants Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen opposed the SEC\u2019s request for an interlocutory appeal.\n\nLawyers for the defendants argued that the SEC had not met the \u201cburden\u201d required for it to \u201cpresent facts that would support stretching [the Howey test] to cover all of the Defendants\u2019 distributions of the digital asset XRP.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers for the defendants also accused the SEC of performing an \u201cabout-face\u201d to rush an appeal because it claims it\u2019s going after \u201cwhat it claims [\u2026] is a purely \u2018legal question\u2019 affecting all other digital-asset cases.\u201d\n\nThe defendants said in their Wednesday filing that they don\u2019t oppose the SEC appealing \u201cthe Court\u2019s decision in the normal course after a final judgment with a full record.\u201d\n\nIn seeking an interlocutory appeal, the SEC is focusing on the judge\u2019s decision on programmatic sales and \u201cother distributions\u201d which included the sale and offer of XRP in exchange for goods or services.\n\nIn July, Judge Torres ruled that the programmatic sales of XRP did not meet all of the Howey test\u2019s criteria. However, the institutional sales did meet Howey standards.\n\nThe court noted that \u201chaving considered the economic reality of the Programmatic Sales, the Court concludes that the undisputed record does not establish the third Howey prong.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Garlinghouse and Larsen face an upcoming jury trial next spring centered around charges claiming that the two aided and abetted securities laws violations in regard to the XRP token. Ripple Labs itself does not face aiding and abetting charges.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
