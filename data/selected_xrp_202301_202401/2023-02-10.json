        "content": "Yesterday\u2019s news revolving around the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s enforcement action against Kraken has once again flushed great uncertainty into the crypto market, but Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has pointed to the positive developments around the world.\n\nGarlinghouse cited a total of five encouraging crypto regulatory news stories worldwide \u2013 all in markets where Ripple has a strong presence.\n\n\u201cStepping back for a moment from what\u2019s happening in the US \u2013 just in the last few weeks, the number of positive (or at least headed in the direction of CLARITY) global regulatory developments is energizing!\u201d, the CEO said and cited Dubai as the first example.\n\nDubai has always been a technology-driven country and has just published a comprehensive new set of regulations for crypto market participants, covering compliance standards, advertising, emissions and more. Ripple landed its first On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partner in the country back in October 2021 with international financial services firm Pyypl.\n\nIn addition, National Bank of Fujairah announced a collaboration with Ripple for cross-border money transfers in March 2020. The partnership was part of a broader initiative to apply the latest technologies to the bank\u2019s operations.\n\nGarlinghouse cites Australia as the second country with regulatory progress, where the Department of Finance is looking to reform the licensing and custody of cryptocurrencies and strengthen consumer protection. A consultation on token mapping was recently released, with the Treasury seeking public input before updating existing frameworks.\n\nWith Novatti and DeeMoney, the company has long standing partners that maintain payment corridors into the country. In October 2021, National Australia Bank (NAB) reported that it had formed an alliance with Israeli bank Leumi and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be working with CIBC and have already partnered with them in using Ripple\u2019s blockchain technology to complete international payments transfers between our banks as a proof of concept,\u201d the announcement reads.\n\nRipple CEO Energized About Global Regulatory Advances\n\nGarlinghouse is also pleased about regulatory progress in the UK, where the new UK HM Treasury consultation reflects the government\u2019s intention to provide an appropriate, clear framework that allows businesses to innovate while maintaining financial stability.\n\nAs Bitcoinist reported, the Bank of England recently published a consultation paper on its CBDC project, where Ripple also finds a mention.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea is also making regulatory strides. The South Korean Financial Services Commission has published guidelines defining what is considered a security token and what is considered a payment token, and how they will be regulated separately.\n\nIn SBI Ripple Asia, Garlinghouse\u2019s company has one of its key global partners in the region. The joint venture between the US fintech and SBI Holdings provides RippleNet to financial institutions and money transfer service providers in Japan, South Korea and certain Southeast Asian countries.\n\nFinally, Garlinghouse cites Brazil, where it is rumored that the country is developing a CBDC in cooperation with Ripple.\n\n\u201cThe list goes on (Brazil\u2019s new legislative framework etc) Note the commonalities \u2013 these regulators are providing leadership and doing the work that we are desperately missing in the US \u2013 unsurprisingly, this is where companies like Ripple are growing!\u201d the Ripple CEO said.\n\nAt press time, XRP was at $0.3854, which means the price has fallen 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Protocol.com, Chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Ranking The Best Utz Chips, From Worst To Best\n\nIn 1921, Bill and Sallie Utz began churning out potato chips in their Hanover, Pennsylvania, kitchen, and over the decades, their company, once known as Hanover Home Brand Potato Chips, made a name for themselves locally in the \"Potato Chip Capital Of The World\" as Utz Quality Foods (via Utz).\n\nBy the 1970s Utz started introducing new flavors, like Barbeque and Sour Cream and Onion, which found new mouths to feed by expanding their reach on supermarket shelves across America, and even worldwide thanks to mail order. The still family owned company also sells fantastic pretzels and other fine snack foods (and many other crunchy goodies from the chip makers they have since acquired, like Zapp's and Bachman), but it always comes back to those potato chips that started them all (via Utz).\n\nToday Utz sells over 30 potato chip flavors under their brand name, adorned with an adorable smiling Utz girl on each bag, and we tasted as many of them as we could get our hands on. Our sharp tongued taste testers spanned generations, from ages 3 to 80, and from their taste buds (with a dash of history), we present to you a ranking of Utz chips, from worst to best!\n\nCrunch! Crunch!"
