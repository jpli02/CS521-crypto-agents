        "content": "Ripple is a decentralized blockchain that develops payment protocols to transfer funds around the world at a lower cost. The Ripple Labs native token XRP is the sixth biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. Currently, XRP is trading at $0.46 and is up 0.6% in the 24-hours day trade, according to CoinMarketCap. After seeing a steady rise in March touching a high of $0.54, XRP saw a decline below the $0.50 mark in April. XRP is trying to reclaim its position and trade above its yearly high of $0.54. Here\u2019s our Ripple XRP price prediction for May 2023, and how the token may look towards the month\u2019s end.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: You Can Now Become a SHIB Billionaire With Only $10,000\n\nRipple XRP Price Prediction: May 2023\n\nSource: TheCoinRepublic.com\n\nLooking at XRP\u2019s price movements this year, the cryptocurrency scaled up from a low of $0.32 to a high of $0.54 in three months. After experiencing a price jump in March, the pattern might not repeat in Q2 of 2023. XRP might not see another jump in the indices and could either dip or trade flat in May 2023.\n\nOn-chain metrics and price prediction firm CoinCodex predicted that the highest Ripple\u2019s native token XRP could reach is $ 0.48 by mid-May. That\u2019s an uptick of only 3.85% from its current price of $0.46 until the next two weeks. According to the price prediction, XRP could also fall to a low of $ 0.41 in May 2023. That\u2019s a decline of 11.15% from its current price.\n\nAlso Read: Pepe Coin: Man Makes $8 Million in 3 Weeks With a $251 Investment\n\nSource: coincodex.com\n\nOther cryptocurrencies also share similar patterns with little to no price movements this month. Tokens such as ChainLink, Solana, and Shiba Inu, are expected to trade sideways over the month. Therefore, it is advised to wait and watch for XRP\u2019s developments before taking an entry position into the token in May.\n\nAt press time, Ripple\u2019s native token was trading at $0.46 and is up 0.6% in the day\u2019s trade. XRP is down 86.34% from its all-time high of $3.40, which it reached in January 2018."

        "title": "The ripple effect of Hunter Dickinson's transfer to Kansas - ESPN",
        "content": "The biggest prize in the transfer portal came off the board Thursday, with former Michigan big man Hunter Dickinson announcing his commitment to Kansas. He chose the Jayhawks over a final list that also included Villanova, Maryland, Kentucky and Georgetown, and his decision could have single-handedly changed the 2023-24 season for any of those five programs.\n\nThe 7-foot-1 star was one of the most dominant centers in the country during his three seasons at Michigan, helping lead the Wolverines to a 1-seed and Elite Eight appearance in 2021 and a Sweet 16 run in 2022. He averaged 17.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in his time with the Wolverines, earning first-team All-Big Ten honors in 2021 and 2023.\n\nWhat type of impact will he make in Lawrence -- and the sport as a whole -- next season? Our men's college basketball experts break it down.\n\nHow does Dickinson fit into the Kansas lineup?\n\nAfter losing Jalen Wilson and Gradey Dick to the NBA, Bill Self hit the reboot button for next season by adding Texas transfer Arterio Morris, once a coveted recruit, and Nicolas Timberlake, a Towson transfer who made nearly 42% of his 3-point attempts last season. Now, he gets Dickinson, a big man who made 42% of his 3-point attempts last season. Dickinson's presence will allow Self to have a dominant big man who makes life easier on the strong backcourt around him, including veteran Dajuan Harris Jr.\n\nWith K.J. Adams Jr. set for a breakout season, Kansas will have a versatile lineup that can use five players on the perimeter and create all kinds of matchup hell for opponents. And Ernest Udeh Jr., a five-star recruit in last year's class, is now a strong backup in the rotation. Self has allowed his bigs to play to their potential and employ their full skill set and he'll do the same for Dickinson, who will want to do more in space than he did at Michigan. This is an incredible boost for a Kansas team that found the perfect addition in Dickinson. He has to be a more consistent defender for this group, though, in a Big 12 full of skilled playmakers who will challenge him at the rim. But Dickinson makes this group one of the most imposing national title contenders. -- Myron Medcalf\n\nThe decision vaults Kansas up most preseason rankings. What will it take to make the Jayhawks the definitive preseason No. 1 team?\n\nI think they're squarely in the conversation now. Dickinson has one of the best pass-first point guards in the country in Dajuan Harris, and Bill Self can go back to running more of the high-low offense that made him so successful, with Dickinson and returning starter K.J. Adams. Morris and Timberlake both bring much-needed perimeter punch in different ways: the former is more aggressive and dynamic with the ball in his hands, while the latter is a knockdown outside shooter. And the Jayhawks also have a top-10 recruiting class entering the program. As it stands, Kansas is a top-five team, at worst, entering the season.\n\nWhat would push the Jayhawks over the top is getting top-10 recruit Mackenzie Mgbako, who recently decommitted from Duke. Mgbako recently visited Kansas, and while schools such as Indiana, St. John's and Louisville are also in the mix, he's the type of versatile forward who would complete this team. -- Jeff Borzello\n\nWhere does Bill Self's squad fall in Bracketology now?\n\nKansas entered the Hunter Dickinson sweepstakes as a projected 3-seed for the 2024 NCAA tournament. His addition clearly lifts the Jayhawks a full seed line -- at worst. As we continue to evaluate the top teams for next year, significant change is still possible among the rosters of UConn, Purdue, Michigan State, Creighton and others. It's not hard to foresee Kansas as a preseason No. 1 seed when all is said and done, however. Given that Bill Self has been a top seed way more often than any other active coach, it would be no surprise. -- Joe Lunardi"

        "title": "The Ripple Effect of Water Insecurity - CSIS | Center for Strategic and International Studies",
        "content": "Land in the Middle East is being exhausted. Ancient nonrenewable underground aquifers are disappearing. Saltwater intrudes both above and below the ground, destroying crops and subterranean sources of drinking water. For many people in the region, this is not a grim future\u2014this is the present. Many parts of the region are becoming uninhabitable because agricultural and pastoral livelihoods are untenable with existing infrastructure. As those people encroach on cities in search of jobs and shelter, they are often not trained in other skills and become another burden on urban areas that struggled to sustain the existing population. This dramatically affects women who struggle to enter the labor force in the Middle East. Agriculture is the largest employer of women in the MENA region. The female share of the agricultural workforce increased from 30 percent in 1980 to almost 45 percent in 2010, and exceeding 60 percent in Jordan, Libya, Syria and the occupied Palestinian Territory. Women who work on farms in the Middle East are often left without skills to obtain other sources of employment or are constrained in the types of employment they may seek.\n\nAs land becomes fallow and further desertification desiccates the land people and their animals depend on, the warming may also be accelerating, creating a vicious cycle. As summer approaches, Iraqis will expect another season of temperatures hovering over 120 degrees Fahrenheit, reaching 130 degrees Fahrenheit in some countries. For reference, this kind of heat feels like being cooked. Government workers and school children will likely be told to stay home again. But with constant power cuts, there is no respite anywhere. One report coauthored by Babel guest Elfatih Eltahir has predicted that at the end of this century, areas of the Persian Gulf could be hit by waves of heat and humidity so severe that simply being outside for several hours could threaten human life. Because of humanity\u2019s contribution to climate change, the authors wrote, some population centers in the Middle East would \u201cexceed the threshold for human adaptability\u201d. This will affect everything from labor laws to rescheduling the annual hajj outside of the hot summer months.\n\nWhile climate change and higher temperatures is part of the problem, it is not the whole picture. Climate scientists say that rising heat combined with decades of poor water management and inefficient agricultural practices have degraded land across the region. With inefficient water usage, the environment has struggled to accommodate a far larger population. Abundant energy resources and U.S. assistance, which tended to prize near-term stability over sustainability, allowed deserts and arid regions to quickly develop, supporting huge numbers of people with reasonable standards of living and, therefore, higher levels of consumption. The total population in the MENA region increased from around 100 million in 1950 to around 380 million in 2000\u2014an increase of 3.7 times and more than any other major world region. While some countries\u2019 population growth is expected to level off, two of the countries most vulnerable to climate change and water insecurity, Iraq and Yemen, will continue to grow exponentially. It is expected that Iraq will grow from 44 million people to 112 million by 2100. The persistence of the current governance and economic model will compromise future generations.\n\nOne country may not be able to curb rising global temperatures alone, but it can improve water security. The glass half full (no pun intended) interpretation is that governments and their populations could work together to develop efficient water and energy management practices. It is half empty because governance is not catching up to meet the challenge.\n\nA third of the countries in the region are embroiled in active conflicts and many others are hosting refugees displaced from those conflicts. Conflicts further delay sustainable planning, degrade human development indicators, and inhibit the data collection needed for regulation. Even states that are not suffering from conflict tend to rely on some element of patronage for governance, whereby elites capture the majority of wealth and resources and distribute just enough to core supporters to survive politically. In many countries, this form of governance has led to inefficient and unregulated water usage, forcing many to live without the human right of clean water or to pay exorbitant prices for it.\n\nFailure to invest in equitable basic services and preservation of public goods has impacted countries that many thought would not face water stress or scarcity in the near term. Though Lebanon and Iraq were once considered relatively water abundant, both have fallen into the category of water stressed in recent years with hardly any wastewater treated\u2014further exacerbating water insecurity. The failure to provide water, among other basic services, especially when it is clear that everyone is not suffering from the same scarcity, has brought the region to a boiling point. Opinion polls show that trust in governance in MENA regions is at historically low levels. This creates its own vicious cycle as populations and their governments engage in myopic decisionmaking that further degrades the environment. As a recent report noted, a low-trust environment shortens the planning horizon and generates little incentives for cooperation. Both are needed for improving water security within and between states.\n\nThis style of governance has completely exhausted an already vulnerable landscape. Yet changing the current model\u2014whether in a democracy or authoritarian system\u2014will not be easy after years of little regulation and generous subsidies.\n\nGovernments in the region should invest in infrastructure, advance transboundary water cooperation, and raise tariffs and taxes, at a moment when they have no money, no peace, and no trust from their populations and, often, their neighbors. As a result, politicians seeking to hold on to power continue to kick the reform can down the road as their populations sizzle with discomfort. For many politicians and vested interests, holding on to the perks of the job may be incompatible with equitable growth\u2014sustainable or otherwise. Many governments responded to the Arab Spring by doubling down on surveillance, repression, and blaming the other, rather than moving toward greater openness and innovation needed to tackle this challenge.\n\nAt the moment when governments are facing these domestic dilemmas, two other major geopolitical shifts will add to the growing pains: the energy transition and renewed great power competition. The energy transition will drastically cut the revenues of countries heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Investing now in sustainable development and infrastructure needed for increased water security is essential. Secondly, a multipolar world may change the motivations of great powers and regional players. The United States, Russia, and China are competing for influence and resources across the Global South. There is a danger that, as during the Cold War, great powers will curry favor with strongman leaders to carve out their share of resources and influence before their adversary does. This race to the bottom could be a disaster for the environment and investment in public goods.\n\nNumerous scholars and officials have focused on the impact of the energy transition in the region. Water security tends to be underappreciated as a game changer in geopolitics or U.S. domestic politics. In a sense, this is true. Energy security affects global markets for vital resources; water affects people where they are. Undoubtedly, water is different than other more commonly traded global commodities. But that is beginning to change in the Middle East. Water is already commodified and traded across international borders. Jordan and Israel recently signed a memorandum of understandingfor a water-for-energy deal, which would trade desalinated water for solar energy."
