        "content": "In September, a Seattle startup lab of white hat hackers sent proof to a senior writer at WIRED Magazine that they could crack the IronKey S200 thumb drive containing 7002 Bitcoins.\n\nBut former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas incredibly refused an offer by the Seattle startup, named Unciphered, to access the USB drive for him.\n\nFmr. Ripple CTO Getting Closer to His 7002 Bitcoins\n\nThomas told WIRED that he had already hired another team to work on the problem for him.\n\nThe former Ripple Labs chief wants to give them a fair shake at retrieving the 7002 Bitcoins before hiring another company. He mentioned they might subcontract the Seattle firm if they can\u2019t get a workable solution together.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm that cracked IronKey S200 is not revealing its method. They did, however, produce three randomly generated passphrase terms for the memory stick without it being revealed to them.\n\nThey say it only took 200 trillion tries using a high-performance computer to get three correct passphrase terms. It could be a chilling preview of how quantum computers could disrupt cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ripple.\n\nThe Perils of DIY Banking with Bitcoin\n\nIt\u2019s not only due to his experience working with Ripple Labs but also his personal experience with locking up 7002 Bitcoin on a thumb drive since 2011 that qualifies Thomas to offer a critical review of the \u201cbe your own bank\u201d narrative that goes along with Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cThis whole idea of being your own bank \u2013 let me put it this way: Do you make your own shoes? The reason we have banks is that we don\u2019t want to deal with all those things that banks do.\u201d\n\nRipple is a blockchain-based digital payments platform and currency exchange service used by financial institutions worldwide. Bitcoin is the originator of hash-based blockchains to quickly settle payments and operates on an open, peer-to-peer network.\n\nRipple was trading at $0.55 at the time of writing. Bitcoin traded at $34,000."

        "content": "The Uphold-Ripple partnership sparks questions about Uphold\u2019s past conversations on XRP reaching $1,000 and whether they may have secretly hinted at the collaboration.\n\nThe prominent American crypto exchange Uphold, renowned for its support for XRP, engineered bullish conversations about the digital asset in the past that have now come back to haunt the firm.\n\nOver the past years, the exchange repeatedly pondered the implication for investors in a scenario where XRP theoretically breaks into a triple-digit valued asset. However, Uphold\u2019s contemplations have largely gone unnoticed.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMeanwhile, the XRP community has exhumed the statements amid the exchange\u2019s recent partnership with Ripple. The XRP Army now wonders if Uphold has had hidden messages all the while.\n\nUphold Talking about XRP Reaching $1000\n\nSpecifically, between 2021 and 2022, the US-based trading platform tweeted multiple times, asking the community about their hopes for XRP. Some XRP enthusiasts replied they anticipate the digital asset to trade over $1,000.\n\nUphold maintained a similar reply to such anticipations. It repeatedly responded by asking: \u201cWhat would you do if XRP reached $1000?\u201d\n\nWhile Uphold\u2019s tweets mentioning XRP reaching $1,000 were all statements in reply to other XRP enthusiasts\u2019 aspirations, the XRP community has come to assume the exchange itself made the bullish projections.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAmid this assumption, they theorized that the exchange subtly hinted at the now-public collaboration with Ripple, which should hypothetically facilitate XRP\u2019s path to $1,000.\n\nFor example, prominent XRP influencer Amelie screenshotted Uphold\u2019s tweet regarding the \u201cif XRP reached $1,000\u201d and added the following remark.\n\n\u201cWhy has Uphold always talked about XRP hitting $1,000 in the past? Hidden message? $1000 confirmed? The partnership between Ripple and Uphold now seems to be something that has been planned for a long time.\u201d\n\nIn another conversation thread, XRP influencer with X username \u201cDigital PerspectivesPermaBull\u201d expressed a similar view on the Uphold tweet, echoing Amelie\u2019s sentiment.\n\nHowever, as so far established, Uphold merely sparked the conversation around XRP reaching $1,000. The projections did not emanate from the exchange. Therefore, it implies there may be no linkage between the bullish statements and the recently publicized Uphold-Ripple partnership.\n\nUphold-Ripple partnership\n\nRecall that Ripple and Uphold forged a strategic alliance earlier this week to enhance cross-border payment services. In the official notification, Ripple detailed intentions to utilize Uphold\u2019s solutions to strengthen its intercontinental payments infrastructure."

National Digital Currency Update : By 2022, 100 CBDCs were in progress, with Nigeria\u2019s eNaira and the Bahamian sand dollar as notable launches. However, Nigerians have been slower to embrace the eNaira compared to global cryptocurrencies.\n\n: By 2022, 100 CBDCs were in progress, with Nigeria\u2019s eNaira and the Bahamian sand dollar as notable launches. However, Nigerians have been slower to embrace the eNaira compared to global cryptocurrencies. Crypto Popularity in Nigeria: Amidst inflation challenges, Nigeria\u2019s young, tech-savvy population is driving rapid cryptocurrency adoption, propelling the nation to the second spot on Chainalysis\u2019 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index.\n\nIn a recent study on central bank digital currencies, the Central Bank of Nigeria cites Ripple Labs research to support its findings about CBDCs.\n\nRipple Labs Research Strengthens Case for CBDCs\n\nThe CBN cited a Ripple study from 2020 showing that some 85% of payment leaders at financial institutions in 22 countries expected their country to launch a CBDC in the next four years.\n\nBy 2022, there were 100 CBDCs in the research or development stage and two fully launched, \u201cthe eNaira in Nigeria, unveiled in October 2021, and the Bahamian sand dollar, which made its debut in October 2020.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian central bank\u2019s report concludes:\n\nCentral bank digital currencies are gaining prominence as cheaper and faster alternative means of transactions with potential to improve the payments-settlement space, financial inclusion and monetary policy transmission.\u201d\n\nSince launching in October 2021, Nigerians have been slow to adopt the eNaira. That\u2019s despite support for Nigerians to use the eNaira to pay electricity bills, television subscriptions, and airline tickets.\n\nBut Nigerians have been quick to adopt global, borderless, blue chip cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Ripple.\n\nNigeria Eagerly Adopts Cryptocurrencies\n\nA Reuters report in September stated that \u201cNigeria\u2019s young, tech-savvy population has eagerly adopted cryptocurrencies,\u201d as the African nation grapples with soaring inflation due to weakness in its official currency.\n\nThat\u2019s a use case cryptocurrency adopters in developed nations can also understand.\n\nFurthermore, the West African nation ranks second on Chainalysis\u2019 2023 grassroots Global Crypto Adoption Index.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin price is soaring to all time high prices in Nigeria, as well as the United States and other inflation stricken nations.\n\nBlockchain cryptocurrencies could be one key to unleashing Nigeria\u2019s full economic potential. Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa today. As its population grows, Nigeria is on track to be the fifth largest economy on earth by 2075."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nRipple, a leading cryptocurrency firm, has teamed up with Uphold, a versatile digital currency platform spanning 184 countries and offering access to over 200 cryptocurrencies. This collaboration aims to supercharge Ripple\u2019s cross-border payment system and amplify its crypto liquidity capabilities. With operations in 55+ countries and payout services in 70 markets, Ripple has already processed a staggering $30 billion in transactions, underlining its pivotal role in the cryptocurrency landscape. Now there are strong rumors about this big tie-up, Uphold\u2019s earlier conversations about XRP hitting $1,000, and whether they tipped the partnership in question.\n\nOver the past years, Uphold had openly engaged in conversations about XRP\u2019s price prospects, particularly in the context of reaching a triple-digit valuation. These discussions, taking place between 2021 and 2022, were framed as speculative musings rather than official forecasts.\n\nUphold\u2019s Tweets on XRP Raising Doubts\n\nUphold initiated these discussions through X Post, asking the XRP community about their hopes and expectations regarding the future price of XRP. Notably, some enthusiastic XRP supporters responded to these inquiries by expressing their anticipation of XRP trading at prices exceeding $1,000. Uphold, in a rather consistent manner, responded to these optimistic anticipations by posing the question: \u201cWhat would you do if XRP reached $1000?\u201d These responses were essentially Uphold\u2019s way of engaging with the XRP community, feeding the excitement surrounding the digital asset.\n\nThe Community\u2019s Assumption and Speculation\n\nUphold\u2019s past chat with the XRP community, while part of a chain reaction, hinted at Uphold\u2019s earlier positive sentiment towards XRP. The community interpreted this conversation as a potential bullish sign and a deeper exploration of XRP\u2019s future potential. Rumors intensified when some in the XRP community took a jab at Uphold\u2019s prior interactions as a hidden message about future collaborations or XRP-related developments.\n\nWhy has @UpholdInc always talked about #XRP hitting $1,000 in the past?\n\n\n\nHidden message? $1000 confirmed?\n\n\n\nThe partnership between Ripple and Uphold now seems to be something that has been planned for a long time\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nejgNDxSSG \u2014 \ud835\udcd0\ud835\udcf6\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcf5\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcee \ud83c\udf6d (@_Crypto_Barbie) October 26, 2023\n\nFor instance, a notable XRP influencer, Amelie, took screenshots of Uphold\u2019s tweets regarding the possibility of XRP reaching $1,000 and questioned whether there were concealed messages within these discussions. This speculation has led to questions about whether Uphold\u2019s partnership with Ripple, which was publicly revealed, may have been planned for a considerable period, potentially with the aim of facilitating XRP\u2019s journey to a $1,000 valuation.\n\nIn a parallel move, Uphold, a U.S. trading platform has also announced plans to buy XRP on the open market for ODL (now Ripple Payments) transactions without leveraging user deposits.\n\nRight now XRP Juggling to Retain Value\u2026\n\nDue to the penalty phase controversy in the Ripple case, XRP\u2019s price outlook is at a critical juncture. Holding above $0.54 may spark a bullish surge to $0.64, potentially rekindling a push towards $1. Conversely, if bears take charge, a test of support around $0.50 is likely. Additionally, the market closely watches for potential whale activity before any resolution in the Ripple Labs case, which could have a significant impact on XRP\u2019s value."

Other Influencing Factors: According to ChatGPT, other factors affecting BTC and XRP\u2019s price performance in 2024 include technological advancements, market sentiment, utility and adoption, competition, and external events.\n\nBTC and XRP, albeit galaxies away in design and purpose, are two of the most heavily discussed cryptocurrencies in the industry.\n\nThe former is intended to serve as a decentralized payment system, and in time, its use case has mostly shifted toward protecting purchasing power amid global inflation woes and economic hurdles. Ripple\u2019s XRP, on the other hand, is a tool for cross-border payments designed by a centralized company.\n\nAnd yet, both BTC and Ripple\u2019s XRP have constantly been part of the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nOf course, BTC has always been in the lead as the number one coin by means of total market capitalization, and to this day, the gap seems tremendous. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that other cryptocurrencies can\u2019t outperform it over a certain period of time.\n\nMost recently, BTC\u2019s price has soared on renewed spot Bitcoin ETF approval hype. You can find more about it here:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) v. Ripple (XRP) in 2024\n\n2024 is shaping up to be a very interesting year in the field of cryptocurrencies, and many believe that\u2019s when a new bull run will come.\n\nThat\u2019s why we decided to poke ChatGPT about a heated question \u2013 will BTC perform better than XRP? The AI-based chatbot provided some interesting insights, arguing that there are multiple factors to take into account.\n\nRegulatory developments seem to be top on its list:\n\nAny positive or negative regulatory news can significantly impact the price of a cryptocurrency. For instance, if a major country were to accept or reject a specific cryptocurrency, it could greatly affect its price and adoption rate.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on this front for both coins. There are multiple filings for a spot Bitcoin ETF that are currently pending review and potential approval, with the hopes of it being as high as ever.\n\nOn the other hand, Ripple continues scoring win after win in its case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The trial is set for April 2024, and its outcome will likely have a massive impact on the price of XRP.\n\nOther Factors Concerning BTC and XRP Price Performance in 2024\n\nChatGPT outlined a few other factors to take into account. These include:\n\nTechnological Advancements\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\nUtility and Adoption\n\nCompetition\n\nExternal Events\n\nIn conclusion, the bot said:\n\nBitcoin, being the first cryptocurrency, has established a dominant position and is often seen as a store of value and \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Its price is less influenced by its utility as a currency and more by its perception as a value store and hedge against traditional financial systems. On the other hand, Ripple and its associated token, XRP, are focused on facilitating real-time cross-border payments for banks and financial institutions. Its value proposition is different from that of Bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, if you want to check out some XRP price predictions for the last quarter of 2023, take a look at our recent video:"
