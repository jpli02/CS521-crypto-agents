        "title": "TikTok will have its own AI music generator - Ghacks",
        "content": "There's a new game changer stepping up to the plate: Ripple, the latest ingenious app launched by ByteDance, the parent company of the social media sensation, TikTok. The unveiling of Ripple marks ByteDance's foray into the realm of music creation with an impressive focus on AI assistance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCurrently in its embryonic stage, Ripple is being tested through an invite-only closed beta program. The application is positioned to emulate the functionality of digital audio workstations, but it sets itself apart by offering a simpler, more streamlined approach. Ripple's allure lies in its focus on accessibility, stripping away the technical intricacies of traditional DAWs.\n\nThe user interface of Ripple is disarmingly straightforward. Imagine humming a melody into your phone's mic and having that hum transformed into a polished track complete with AI-generated instrumentals, including drums, guitar, and bass. The track duration directly corresponds to the length of the user's hum - hum a symphony, get a symphony; hum a snippet, get a snippet.\n\nHowever, Ripple does maintain certain limits. While it's a virtuoso at generating instrumental music, it leaves the realm of vocals untouched. This, in essence, turns Ripple into a convenient tool for aspiring artists who may not have instrumental skills, but harbor a burning desire to create original music.\n\nMoving beyond simple track generation, Ripple offers a \"virtual recording studio\" where users can further refine their musical creations. They can cut and move audio files, effectively sculpting their ideal song from the raw materials provided by the AI.\n\nCould this move give TikTok a monopoly in the market?\n\nThe proprietary nature of the music used to train Ripple is a strategic move by ByteDance. The company has either created the training data themselves or obtained the necessary licenses, thereby ensuring that they navigate clear of any potential copyright complications.\n\nRipple is not just a standalone endeavor. It's intrinsically tied to TikTok, enabling users to import their Ripple-created tracks for use as background music on the video-sharing platform.\n\nRipple is shaping up to be yet another feather in ByteDance's cap. It embodies the merging of music, technology, and creativity, offering users an unprecedented platform for musical exploration and creation. The seamless interconnection with TikTok could also herald a new era of user-generated music in the world of social media. With Ripple, ByteDance is humming a tune of innovation, and it seems the world is ready to join the chorus.\n\nAdvertisement"

        "title": "Black hole ripples could help pin down expansion of universe - Phys.org",
        "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nSchematic of the reflection process in the black hole Cygnus X-1. The light emitted from the jet is shown in blue, which we say originates from a point source some distance above the black hole. The X-rays following path a) are observed directly by our telescopes. The light that follows paths (labelled b & c), reflect off the disc and follow the green trajectories to reach us. Light travelling along a) follows the shortest path to reach us, whereas the light travelling along path c) takes the longest path, and therefore takes the longest time to reach us. Credit: Patrick O\u2019Neill, NASA/JPL-Caltech. Licence type Attribution (CC BY 4.0)\n\nThe echoes of light from jets launched from black holes offers a new way to pin down the distance to these exotic objects and to study a largely unobserved population in the center of the Galaxy. It could also even help determine the rate of expansion of the universe. The technique, developed by a team at the University of Newcastle and tested on the archetype black hole Cygnus X-1, was presented by postgraduate researcher and team member Patrick O'Neill at the National Astronomy Meeting in Cardiff.\n\nMost black holes are the compact remnants of stars that ended their lives in supernova explosions. They have such a strong gravitational field that not even light can escape their grasp, hence the description of them as black. Despite that, the influence on their surroundings can be very obvious, as material orbiting a black hole is concentrated into a disk, and can become very hot. This means they are strong sources of X-rays, and many also have associated jets spewing gas and dust out over huge distances.\n\nThe calculated distance to most black holes is based on their X-ray brightness and associated measurements of their mass, which can be deduced by how fast material swirls around them. O'Neill and the other team members take a different approach.\n\nLight from the black hole jet is emitted in all directions, so this reaches the disk. Just like a mirror, the disk then reflects some part of the incoming light. Starting from the innermost part of the disk, the reflected light will ripple outwards as the light emitted in the jet takes longer to reach the outer parts of the disk. This \"reverberation\" of light is akin to a sound echo.\n\nThis effectively means we see the light originating from the jet in two ways: the light that travels directly to us, and the light that is reflected by the disk. By simultaneously monitoring the brightness of the light that travels directly to us and the light that is reflected, it becomes possible to deduce how far the jet is above the disk. It also tells astronomers how close the inner boundary of the disk is to the black hole itself. Closer in the gravitational field of the black hole disrupts the shape of the disk.\n\nMonitoring the light emitted from the black hole jet and its surrounding disk together enables the team to calculate the size of the disk, and the fraction of the light it reflects. That gives an absolute measurement of the brightness of the disk, and hence the distance to the black hole-disk system.\n\nDense clouds of gas and dust typically block infrared, visible and ultraviolet light emitted from the centers of galaxies (including our own), restricting our view. In contrast, X-rays can cross these regions unimpeded, so it should be possible to measure the distance to supermassive black holes. If that can be done, it will be a new way of determining how fast the universe is expanding, something still not settled 94 years after the discovery of the expansion itself.\n\nIt is also a powerful tool for probing the population of black holes in the center of the galaxy. Up to now astronomers tended to observe black holes that were relatively light, and away from the plane of the galaxy where most stars are found (our galaxy has spiral arms in a flat disk winding out from a central bar).\n\nSometimes a black hole and a massive star orbit each other in a binary system. If the massive star explodes as a supernova, the black hole can be thrown out of the plane of the galaxy. The heavier the black hole, the smaller the acceleration, so heavier mass black holes will be found closer to the galactic plane and in the galactic center.\n\nO'Neill says, \"Often we are limited to observations of distant galaxies to make inferences about the Milky Way. This cutting-edge technique offers a method of probing the previously concealed galactic center, offering a new insights into the evolution of our own galaxy and how black holes accrete material [MOU1] . It's also exciting to think that we could help to establish the rate at which the universe is expanding\u2014and get a better understanding of its future.\"\n\nThe team now want to build up a picture of the population of black holes in the center of the galaxy. This could help find objects like intermediate mass black holes, objects thought to result from the mergers of black holes from single stars, and a step on the way to forming the monster-sized supermassive black holes found in the center of most galaxies."

        "title": "TikTok Unveils AI-Powered Music Generator: Ripple - ReadWrite",
        "content": "ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, has recently released a revolutionary new app called Ripple. This move is a game-changer that further solidifies TikTok\u2019s dominance in the realm of social media. Ripple is an innovative app that promises to revolutionize the landscape of music creation. Ripple is a music generator that is powered by AI and was designed to make the process of creating original tracks easier by leveraging the power of AI. Ripple has the potential to completely revolutionize the approach that aspiring musicians and content creators take to the process of music production thanks to its intuitive user interface and seamless integration with TikTok.\n\nTikTok\u2019s developer, the tech giant ByteDance, has always been one step ahead of the competition in terms of developing cutting-edge products. Ripple is ByteDance\u2019s first foray into the world of music creation, and it employs the assistance of AI to shake things up in this competitive industry. Ripple is currently in the preliminary stages of its development and is undergoing testing as part of a closed beta program that is invitation-only and exclusive. The application attempts to simulate the performance of digital audio workstations (DAWs), but it differentiates itself by providing a method that is less complicated, more streamlined, and which places an emphasis on accessibility.\n\nRipple\u2019s user interface is deceptively straightforward, which is one of the primary features that sets it apart from more conventional digital audio workstations (DAWs). Imagine humming a tune into the microphone of your smartphone and having that hum turned into a fully polished track with AI-generated instrumentals, including drums, guitar, and bass. This is exactly what is possible today thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. Because the length of the track directly corresponds to the length of the user\u2019s hum, the user has the ability to create anything from full-length symphonies to brief musical excerpts.\n\nRipple is particularly effective when it comes to the creation of instrumental music, but it does not currently support vocal tracks. Due to this limitation, Ripple is best suited as a music production tool for aspiring musicians who may lack the necessary instrumental skills but have a strong desire to develop their own musical styles. Ripple gives its users the ability to freely express their creativity and effortlessly create original tracks by drawing on the power of artificial intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the generation of tracks, Ripple also provides users with a virtual recording studio in which they can further develop and perfect their original compositions. Users are given the ability to cut and move audio files within this virtual studio, allowing them to sculpt their ideal songs from the raw materials provided by the AI. Ripple gives its users this level of control, which enables them to personalize their tracks to fit their artistic vision and produce music that resonates with the audience for which it was intended.\n\nBecause Ripple and TikTok are inextricably linked, users are able to effortlessly import tracks that they have created with Ripple and use them as background music on the popular video-sharing platform. This integration paves the way for new opportunities for musicians and content creators, supplying them with an extensive library of AI-generated tracks that they can use to enhance their TikTok videos. Ripple and TikTok hope to usher in a new era of user-generated music by closing the gap that currently exists between the process of making music and the use of social media. This will give creators the ability to craft interactive content that will captivate audiences all over the world.\n\nByteDance has taken a strategic approach to the music that is used to train Ripple\u2019s artificial intelligence in order to ensure a seamless user experience and to avoid any potential copyright complications. This is the case because ByteDance wants to avoid any potential copyright complications and ensure a seamless user experience. Either the company creates the training data themselves or it obtains the necessary licenses. Either way, this ensures that the tracks that are generated are in compliance with the copyright regulations. Users of Ripple can use their creations on TikTok and other platforms with peace of mind thanks to this proprietary approach, which prevents them from infringing on intellectual property rights and gives them the ability to use their creations without fear.\n\nRipple is a symbol of the intersection of music, technology, and creative expression; it is more than just an app. Its availability and integration with TikTok have the potential to democratize music creation by making it possible for anyone with a smartphone and a creative spark to easily compose original tracks. This could lead to an increase in the amount of people who participate in the production of music. This has the potential to completely transform the way the music business operates. As the music industry continues to advance, the combination of artificial intelligence and the creative process of making music paves the way for the possibility of fascinating new business opportunities. With the release of Ripple, ByteDance has demonstrated once more that it is dedicated to innovation and that it possesses the capability to shape the future of social media and music.\n\nAs TikTok maintains its preeminent position in the social media landscape, the launch of Ripple bolsters the platform\u2019s standing as a forerunner in the sector. Ripple makes the process of making music easier to understand and accessible to more people by drawing on the capabilities of artificial intelligence. Its integration with TikTok opens up new possibilities for content creators, giving them the ability to enhance their videos with background tracks generated by artificial intelligence (AI). ByteDance has not only created an app with the help of Ripple, but the company has also established the foundation for a brand-new era of user-generated music. It is abundantly clear that Ripple is going to make waves and redefine the way that we produce and consume music in the digital age as the music industry continues to open its arms to the potential of artificial intelligence.\n\nFirst reported on gHacks"

        "content": "What\u2019s happened?\n\nMBW Explains is a series of analytical features in which we explore the context behind major music industry talking points \u2013 and suggest what might happen next. Only MBW+ subscribers have unlimited access to these articles.\n\nUltra-popular short video app TikTok has become \u2013 for lack of a better expression \u2013 a major player in the music business.\n\nThe app has been the seed behind some of the biggest musical phenomena in recent years, including Lil Nas X\u2019s megahit Old Town Road.\n\nIt has at times stunned observers with its ability to resurrect classic tracks and turn them into hits all over again, as was the case with Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Dreams and Simple Plan\u2019s I\u2019m Just A Kid, which got new life as hits for a second time 41 and 18 years after they were initially released, respectively.\n\nAccording to TikTok, 13 out of the 14 number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 2022 were \u201cdriven by significant viral trends on TikTok.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s beyond doubt at this point that TikTok has become a major influence on recorded music, in terms of both which artists and which songs rise to prominence. But if this observation is reversed, it still rings just as true: Music is a major reason for TikTok\u2019s rise in popularity.\n\nNo wonder the major recording companies are publicly hinting at \u2013 and privately pushing for \u2013 a bigger slice of TikTok\u2019s advertising revenue pie.\n\nTwo questions have been hanging over this conversation in recent months: To what extent is TikTok willing to pay more to license copyrighted music for the videos users post to its platform? And to what extent will TikTok resist attempts at greater revenue-sharing, and instead replace music from major and indie labels with its own musical ecosystem?\n\nWe came a lot closer to the answer to those questions last week, when TikTok owner ByteDance unveiled Ripple, a free-to-use music production app with two principal features: an AI \u201cmelody-to-song\u201d generator, and a virtual recording studio.\n\nThe melody-to-song feature allows users to hum a melody directly into the app, around which Ripple builds an instrumental musical track, equal in length to the original hummed melody.\n\n(In response to growing concerns within the music industry about AI models training on copyrighted music without permission, ByteDance told MBW it trained Ripple on music licensed to or owned by the company.)\n\nThe virtual recording studio works much like other portable digital audio workstations such as Splice, BandLab\u2019s Cakewalk or Apple\u2019s GarageBand.\n\nRipple users will be able to upload their musical creations to TikTok or other social media platforms. For the time being at least, it\u2019s being released to a small group of beta testers via invitation.\n\nFor many observers, the idea that TikTok would want to jump into the increasingly crowded fields of AI music generators and digital audio workstations for its own sake doesn\u2019t make sense. It does, however, make sense if TikTok is trying to replace music from the major and indie labels with music it doesn\u2019t have to pay for.\n\nWhat\u2019s the context?\n\nRipple\u2019s release comes amid negotiations between TikTok and the major recording companies over the size and structure of the payments the video app makes for the use of copyrighted music in videos uploaded to TikTok.\n\nSo far, TikTok\u2019s arrangement with the recording companies has been for so-called \u201cbuy-out\u201d agreements, under which the social media site pays a lump sum to use licensed music across its platform for a period of two years.\n\nThe current agreements with the big three recording companies \u2013 Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group \u2013 were signed between November 2020 and February 2021, meaning their time is running out. And reports suggest that the majors want to replace the lump-sum deals with a share of TikTok\u2019s ad revenue on music-led videos.\n\nBut TikTok has been playing hardball, and in more ways than one.\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that TikTok disabled the ability of certain users in Australia to add major label-licensed music to their videos. Additionally, certain already uploaded videos featuring these tracks would be muted.\n\nSources told MBW that the move was designed to give TikTok leverage in its negotiations with the record labels; if the experiment showed little significant decline in user engagement, TikTok would be able to argue that music is not a major part of the TikTok experience.\n\nTikTok reportedly lost users during the experiment. \u2013 Evidence that music is a key part of TikTok, as further demonstrated by ByteDance\u2019s own actions.\n\n\u201cWe have lots of people [working at TikTok] who came from record labels and publishers and societies, and we understand how complicated, how capital-intensive, and how specialized that business is. It does not fit into our strategy to become a record label.\u201d Ole Obermann, TikTok\n\nIn the spring of 2022, TikTok launched its own music promotion and distribution platform, dubbed SoundOn. Besides distribution on TikTok, SoundOn is also able to distribute music to other platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and Instagram.\n\nIt can also distribute to Resso, ByteDance\u2019s social media platform expressly for sharing music. The app is currently available in Brazil, India and Indonesia, but Ole Obermann, TikTok\u2019s Global Head of Music Business Development, told MBW in May that it\u2019s the company\u2019s ambition to make the app available worldwide.\n\nInitially launched in the US, UK, Brazil and Indonesia, the platform has now expanded to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Mexico. SoundOn pays creators 100% of the royalties generated by their music in the first year, and 90% after that \u2013 a pretty good deal, compared to traditional music labels.\n\nSoundOn scored a major publicity coup earlier this year when it landed an exclusive contract with Death Row Records and Snoop Dogg to bring the label\u2019s catalog to TikTok exclusively for a week, before its return to major streaming platforms.\n\nNow, with the release of music-making app Ripple, it\u2019s hard to avoid the impression that TikTok is positioning itself to be an all-in-one shop for music creators. Use Ripple to generate a song and turn it into a track, then take it to SoundOn for distribution on TikTok and other platforms. No labels \u2013 major, indie or otherwise \u2013 needed.\n\nYet the company insists that it isn\u2019t becoming a music label.\n\n\u201cThere is no intention of TikTok becoming like a record label,\u201d Obermann said in his interview with MBW.\n\n\u201cSoundOn was really born from one of the main objectives [we have] at TikTok, which is to work with our creator community, to allow them to make money, get discovered, and to strike partnerships and relationships with brands,\u201d Obermann said.\n\n\u201cSoundOn is the answer to all of those, as well as: How do we address the fact that so many unsigned, unknown, or unidentifiable pieces of music are coming on to TikTok? And how do we make that better for the community?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have lots of people [working at TikTok] who came from record labels and publishers and societies, and we understand how complicated, how capital-intensive, and how specialized that business is. It does not fit into our strategy to become a record label.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIn the coming months, the major recording companies \u2013 Sony, Universal and Warner \u2013 might have news about new deals with TikTok.\n\nGiven the majors\u2019 resistance to continuing with the \u201cbuy-out\u201d model, it will be interesting to see if those deals are a repeat of the agreements TikTok had previously had with the companies \u2013 though whether the details of those deals will be made public is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nAnd the degree to which TikTok will be willing to concede to the majors will depend on a number of factors \u2013 including the outcome of its Australian experiment.\n\nPreliminary reports suggest that a number of younger Australian users who were blocked from using licensed music reduced their usage of the app, or even left it altogether. If true, this would give considerable leverage to the recording companies.\n\n\u201cIf we were forced to take down a catalog or part of a catalog, we are pretty confident that we could still remain a compelling service for our users.\u201d Ole Obermann, TikTok\n\nHowever, also playing into this will be the performance of SoundOn and Ripple. If these apps prove popular with TikTok users, it will give ByteDance a reason to continue playing hardball with the music industry, on the argument that the platform\u2019s users can (and do) generate their own music, and don\u2019t need to rely on licensed music from major record companies.\n\nIt will be about more than the number of subscribers; if TikTok is to pull off this dramatic shift in how its platform is used, it will need to see evidence that not only are people signing up to Ripple and SoundOn, but that they are actually generating music and distributing it, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 that TikToks with this music are going viral, and the songs themselves are becoming popular.\n\nThat\u2019s a tall order, but TikTok has been promoting some of SoundOn\u2019s early successes, such as that of 20-year-old Canadian Katherine Li, who in 2022 released an EP through SoundOn that, according to a TikTok press release, has been streamed 49 million times on Spotify alone.\n\nNevertheless, the record majors have their own leverage: If they don\u2019t get a deal that satisfies them, any one of them could simply refuse to license their music to TikTok. Depending on which company it is, this could mean a loss of between 15% and a third of the major-label music available for use by TikTokers.\n\nThat could seriously affect the TikTok user experience, though Obermann doesn\u2019t seem particularly worried about such a scenario.\n\n\u201cIf we were forced to take down a catalog or part of a catalog, we are pretty confident that we could still remain a compelling service for our users,\u201d he asserted in May.\n\nWhether that\u2019s bravado in the face of record company negotiations, or a sober assessment of TikTok\u2019s position in the marketplace and cultural sphere, is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nA final thought\u2026\n\nAll of this comes at a time when TikTok\u2019s future has grown uncertain because of the rising tensions between China and Western countries.\n\nAs the world\u2019s most popular Chinese-owned app \u2013 TikTok has become a magnet for criticism among across North America and Europe.\n\nWorried about the close ties between ByteDance and the Chinese Communist Party \u2013 which could mean that China\u2019s government has had access to detailed user data from countries around the world \u2013 many governments have banned TikTok from government-issued devices.\n\nAmong them are the US, UK, European Union, Canada, Australia and others. Some countries, namely Afghanistan and India, have banned TikTok outright, as has the US state of Montana, though TikTok has vowed to fight the ban on freedom of speech grounds.\n\nFollowing a four-and-a-half-hour grilling of TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in front of the US Congress this spring, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee advanced a bill that would authorize President Joe Biden to ban TikTok throughout the country.\n\nHowever, that bill has not made much progress since, and many critics have pointed out that it\u2019s both unusual and constitutionally questionable for a law to target a specific company.\n\nNonetheless, TikTok finds itself at the center of major geopolitical shifts in the world today in a way that other platforms aren\u2019t.\n\nStrangely enough, TikTok\u2019s potential campaign to build itself into a musical behemoth is dependent on developments in the ongoing US-China trade war, and developments over the status of Taiwan.\n\nThat places a large question mark over its future \u2013 and even over the majors\u2019 licensing negotiations with the platform. TikTok might soon be a major generator of music, competing with the likes of Universal and Sony \u2013 or it might soon be gone, or anything in between.\n\nThat radically wide range of possible outcomes adds a layer of uncertainty to all of this that likely doesn\u2019t help anyone in the music business sleep at night.Music Business Worldwide"
