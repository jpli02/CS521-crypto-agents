        "title": "Hairdressers, camerapeople, caterers: the \u2018scary\u2019 ripple effect of the Hollywood writers\u2019 strike - The Guardian",
        "content": "As screenwriters across the country go on strike for the first time in 15 years, it won\u2019t just be writers\u2019 rooms that are empty. Without writers, studios must postpone or shut down productions, bringing shows off the air and affecting virtually every profession in the TV and film industry, from cinematographers to caterers, with effects rippling out to the broader economy.\n\n\u201cThis struggle is our struggle,\u201d said Cory Hunter, a Los Angeles-based camera operator. \u201cWe all have been squeezed in the change to streaming.\u201d Without jobs, he\u2019s planning to get through the next few months by helping a family member do real estate work.\n\nDarrius Peace, an Alabama-based hairstylist who often flies out to work on movie sets, where he specializes in Afro-texture hair, says he\u2019ll have to replace those jobs with more hours at his salon.\n\nPaige Simmons, the owner of Dine With 9, a Los Angeles caterer for production crews, says \u201cit\u2019s a little scary right now\u201d: multiple clients have canceled their orders, and unlike during the height of the pandemic, there\u2019s no federal aid coming for a writers\u2019 strike.\n\nWhile writers are stopping work with the hope of improving their remuneration, the rest of the film industry is simply waiting to hear when they can go back to work. Nevertheless, there is a remarkable amount of solidarity.\n\nPeace is cheering on the writers: \u201cRight now, it may hurt. But in the long run, it\u2019s worth it. Once the writers succeed, everybody else can demand more.\u201d\n\nSimmons supports the strike because many of her serving staff also work in the entertainment industry. \u201cEveryone understands the importance of solidarity,\u201d she says.\n\nThe entertainment business is highly profitable. In recent years, the combined profits of giants like Warner Bros, Netflix, Disney, Comcast and Paramount have reached close to $30bn a year, as their streaming services continue to add subscribers. CEO pay has soared, with the top 12 entertainment bosses receiving about $1bn in total pay in 2021.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kim Steele, an actor and writer, holds a sign in support of the strike outside the Warner Bros Discovery Atlanta campus on Tuesday. Photograph: Alyssa Pointer/Reuters\n\nEntertainment industry workers say that wealth hasn\u2019t been shared with them, and it\u2019s getting harder to stay afloat. After a long drought of opportunities during the pandemic, workers have been hit by recent layoffs and declining job openings. Studios are cutting positions and experimenting with AI to replace roles.\n\nWith talk of the strike looming for months, producers have held back projects in anticipation, \u201cso many of us already were kind of in \u2018famine mode\u2019\u201d, Hunter says.\n\nThe strike began on Tuesday after the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which negotiates on behalf of major studios, failed to reach a new contract agreement. According to the Writers Guild, streaming platforms have upended long-held labor standards by shortening TV seasons and hiring fewer writers for briefer stints \u2013 essentially turning them into gig workers.\n\nIn the past, entertainment unions have not always agreed on strikes \u2013 sometimes even openly feuding during them \u2013 but this time there\u2019s a remarkable sense of solidarity, at least for now. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), the actors\u2019 union Sag-Aftra, and the Hollywood Teamsters union are among guilds that have expressed support for the strike.\n\nWhile these unions aren\u2019t on strike, their members may choose not to cross picket lines \u2013 a decision protected by some of their contracts. \u201cTeamsters don\u2019t just talk about solidarity, we are contractually protected to walk the walk,\u201d the union said in recent guidance sent to its members.\n\nOne big reason for the unity is a pervasive feeling of worsening inequality, says Jonathan Handel, a Los Angeles-based lawyer and entertainment union expert. As streaming companies \u201cspend billions of dollars building out platforms and profit-generation machines\u201d, writers are demanding \u201ca fair share of that and sustainable careers, and that\u2019s a message that resonates with the rest of the workforce as well\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake in the fight is the future of the entertainment business model, says Handel. The last writers\u2019 strike in 2007 was in part a disagreement over the residuals \u2013 a type of royalties \u2013 that writers could earn from new formats like DVDs and online downloads. Streaming is an even bigger shift. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen such a dramatic and tumultuous period of technological change in the film entertainment industry since after the second world war,\u201d he says, when Americans switched from theaters to watching TV at home.\n\nScott Leslie, a Studio City, Los Angeles-based prop man and set dresser at Warner Brothers and a member of IATSE, which represents production crews, says his work hours have dropped during the streaming era, and he fears layoffs will be next. His wife, Julie Ganis, a freelance book editor, worries what will happen to them and their son in college if Leslie loses his job, \u201calong with his union paychecks and union benefits, like healthcare\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen A giant inflatable rat, a symbol of organized labor, is displayed as writers picket outside Peacock NewFronts in New York. Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP\n\nWith the strike starting, Ganis is trying to renegotiate their son\u2019s financial aid package: \u201cMy income is not enough to support the family.\u201d But the couple staunchly backs the writers: \u201cI really want them to hold the line and get what\u2019s right, even though it\u2019ll cost the town lots of money and wages and ancillary things,\u201d Leslie says. His wife agrees: \u201cOur enemy is not the writers, it\u2019s the corporate overlords who are putting skyrocketing profits for Wall Street ahead of everything.\u201d\n\nHunter, the camera operator and another IATSE member, says he\u2019s been having conversations with other camera operators about how to find side hustles. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be in this amazing industry with great careers, yet so many of us are having to look elsewhere to make ends meet. Whether that\u2019s unemployment every 18 months, or side hustles, or whatever, the viability of our careers is at stake,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what really connected with me when the writers say it\u2019s a critical moment for them as the viability of their livelihood hangs in the balance.\u201d\n\nEntertainment workers are hopeful that by staying united, they will be able to push the studios for better conditions. In less than two months, Sag-Aftra\u2019s contract with AMPTP will need to be renegotiated as well, and many actors see their fates as intertwined with writers\u2019.\n\n\u201cWriters are on the frontlines, and we have to make sure we support them, because it\u2019s a domino effect,\u201d says the actor Justin Shenkarow, a Sag-Aftra member. \u201cIf they\u2019re able to fight and get their proper wages and working conditions, then hopefully that will trickle over to the rest of the unions as well.\u201d\n\nShenkarow, who is also the co-founder of ThreePointZero, a small animation studio, says he\u2019s particularly concerned about AI and hopes the unions can win some rules targeting it: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen such a huge uptick in AI in the last several months, and we need to make sure AI doesn\u2019t replace the voiceover industry.\u201d\n\nThe writer\u2019s strike could even have impacts beyond the United States. Eben Bolter, a UK-based cinematographer who recently worked as a director of photography on HBO\u2019s The Last of Us, says \u201cwriters in the UK and everywhere are going to look at what\u2019s happening in the US\u201d, and a win by the Writers Guild \u201cwould empower UK writers and everywhere to expect better\u201d. While he\u2019s \u201cstressed\u201d about where his next paycheck will come from, \u201cI still support [the strike], because I think they\u2019re doing the right thing. And what they\u2019re asking for is very reasonable.\u201d"

        "title": "What's ripple effect of Columbia River cruises? - The Daily News",
        "content": "Some people are drawn to the sun and festivities of the Mexican Riviera. Some go for the wilderness and scenic wonders of Alaska, and others opt for the intimacy of small boats cruising European rivers.\n\nBut an increasing number of cruising opportunities are popping up close to home, as cruise lines expand their offerings along the Columbia River.\n\nThis year, there are nine ships cruising the river, carrying thousands of passengers from Astoria through the Columbia River Gorge and up the Snake River to Clarkston in Eastern Washington.\n\nCruising on the Columbia isn\u2019t cheap. Fares this year cost anywhere from around $2,500 per person to more than $11,000, according to the booking website USA River Cruises.\n\n\u201cThe Pacific Northwest offers breathtaking scenery, the chance to retrace the expedition path of Lewis and Clark and indulge in the finest wines and freshest seafood Oregon and Washington have to offer,\u201d reads a statement from American Queen Voyages. The company operates the American Empress, which docks along the Vancouver waterfront during its trips up and down the river.\n\nBut while river cruises have become a booming industry on the Columbia River, the jury is still out on the economic impact they\u2019re actually bringing to the region.\n\nThe company says its trips boost the economy of the region. Its passengers usually take part in excursions when they\u2019re in port, and they have souvenir and retail opportunities at each port.\n\n\u201cOur goal is support those already built into the fabric of the community and uplift regional members,\u201d the statement said.\n\nPorts of call impact mixed\n\nPart of the appeal of river cruises is that they\u2019re all-inclusive, meaning passengers often eat on board. That\u2019s not great news for restaurants along Vancouver\u2019s waterfront, where those interviewed haven\u2019t seen much business from cruise passengers.\n\nPorts in Kalama, Camas-Washougal and Stevenson also are hosts to river cruises.\n\nThe Port of Kalama began welcoming American Cruise Lines last spring \u2014 a $3.5 million project that was split between the port and the cruise line. Port public relations administrator Dan Polacek says it\u2019s difficult to quantify the total financial impacts of passengers to the town\u2019s business core.\n\nThat port\u2019s cruise dock is a busy one, having welcomed four ships per week between April and November of 2022, with an estimated 16,500 visitors. American Cruise Lines increased its business at the port in 2023, with five ships now docking there each week, around 20,000 passengers for the year.\n\nEven so, the nearby McMenamins Kalama Harbor Lodge, while convenient, isn\u2019t often frequented by cruise passengers.\n\n\u201cWe see a little bit of a bump in our gift shop and from the crew at times coming in to eat,\u201d said Renee Rank Ignacio, director of marketing at McMenamins. \u201cBut for the most part, the passengers are not coming in to eat and drink.\u201d\n\nIf they come in, it\u2019s to grab merchandise or cans of beer or wine to go, added Ignacio.\n\nThe story is much the same in Camas and Washougal. The Clark County Historical Museum hosted cruise passengers last year when they stopped at the Port of Camas-Washougal.\n\nThe museum\u2019s tour, which will be running again later this year, took passengers to Washougal\u2019s Two Rivers Heritage Museum, Pendleton Mill Store and Captain William Clark Park and then historic downtown Camas for shopping.\n\nThe Two Rivers museum alone saw 1,560 cruise passengers last year.\n\nYet, even though tour guides provided coupons and maps for passengers, museum Executive Director Bradley Richardson heard from Camas businesses that not many saw a significant bump in sales.\n\nRichardson acknowledged it wasn\u2019t what they hoped. But he said they were honored to get the chance to advocate for local businesses rather than a cruise company just hiring a tourism group from outside the area.\n\n\u201cThe hope is we can continue to grow and encourage the guests to shop in historic downtown Camas,\u201d he said.\n\nExcursion sites keep busy\n\nWhile the cruise industry hasn\u2019t yet proved to be a windfall for local retailers, it has had a significant impact for those businesses fortunate enough to be an excursion destination.\n\nTwo of the must-do tours when cruising the Columbia are going to Mount St. Helens and visiting the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center.\n\nThe Mount St. Helens Visitor Center remained consistently busy during last year\u2019s cruise season. The center even brought on more interpretive staff to accommodate the extra visitors and cruise ship passengers, which often arrived in three to four buses at a time.\n\n\u201cWe enjoyed the change, and our colleagues to the south and east of us were welcoming the same folks \u2014 at the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center and the Sacajawea Interpretive Center, both located along the Columbia River,\u201d said Alysa Adams, interpretive ranger at the Mount St. Helens Visitor Center.\n\nThe center held multiple educational ranger programs each day to meet the demand of the tours.\n\nIn the heart of the Gorge, the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center in Stevenson also has passengers bused to its doors. During the cruise season, Jessica Chamberlin, the museum\u2019s visitors manager, estimates passengers make up 70 percent to 80 percent of the museum\u2019s attendees.\n\nThe cruise companies also often set up tasting events at local breweries and wineries, which bring passengers to specific businesses in the area.\n\nEvoke Winery hosted a very successful party for a cruise ship at its winery in Hood River, Ore., said Evoke\u2019s Shelly Kice.\n\nAirfield Estates\u2019 Vancouver Tasting Room hosted two private tasting events for American Empress passengers in the past few weeks. There are two more scheduled for later in the cruise season. It recently got an inquiry for a private event from another cruise line, as well. The events so far haven\u2019t been lucrative, though the business is hoping sales during the events pick up.\n\nJust on Monday the business held 70 tastings for passengers \u2014 all at a reduced rate. There were only a couple of bottles sold, said tasting room manager Jeremy Parker.\n\nDespite not making many sales, the tasting room has been happy to get its name out there.\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019re pretty happy and looking forward to doing more of them,\u201d said Parker.\n\nEffect on ports not yet clear\n\nThe ports say they are happy with the cruise business at their docks.\n\nThe Port of Skamania built its cruise ship dock many years ago for the smaller day cruises and added dolphins, wooden pilings that are used by the longer cruise ships that started cruising the river more recently.\n\n\u201cIt was a way of expanding our economic impact,\u201d said Pat Albaugh, executive director at the Port of Skamania. The port docks around 200 cruise ships each season, though one company recently contracted with the Port of Cascade Locks in Oregon instead.\n\nThere are no numbers on what kind of economic impact the cruise industry has had on Vancouver. Those numbers may be coming in the next year, according to Cliff Myers at Visit Vancouver USA.\n\nThe Port of Camas-Washougal used visitor spending impacts estimated by the cruise lines to estimate economic impacts. That study showed the total economic impact in the community was $2.29 million. The port completed its $1.4 million breakwater access ramps last year.\n\n\u201cI think cruise ships are seeing these developments in these small communities and taking advantage of that, and that\u2019s future demand that I think will continue,\u201d said Derek Jaeger, director of business development and real estate at the Port of Camas-Washougal, pointing to the new waterfront developments in Vancouver, Kalama and Camas-Washougal.\n\nFor Myers at Visit Vancouver USA, the organization is bullish on cruises but with trepidation, lacking actionable information.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say, he said, that passengers are staying overnight in local hotels and shopping and eating at local retailers.\n\nHe questions if retailers would be able to tell that cruise passengers are specifically coming in to shop and eat, saying passengers don\u2019t stick out like some other visitors to the area.\n\n\u201cWe really feel like there\u2019s a lot to be said here, but again, we just need to be smart. We need to point ourselves in the right direction with some information that we don\u2019t have currently,\u201d said Myers."

Its passengers usually take part in excursions when they\u2019re in port, and they have souvenir and retail opportunities at each port.\n\n\u201cOur goal is support those already built into the fabric of the community and uplift regional members,\u201d the statement said.\n\nPorts of call impact mixed\n\nPart of the appeal of river cruises is that they\u2019re all-inclusive, meaning passengers often eat on board. That\u2019s not great news for restaurants along Vancouver\u2019s waterfront, where those interviewed haven\u2019t seen much business from cruise passengers.\n\nPorts in Kalama, Camas-Washougal and Stevenson also are hosts to river cruises.\n\nThe Port of Kalama began welcoming American Cruise Lines last spring \u2014 a $3.5 million project that was split between the port and the cruise line. Port public relations administrator Dan Polacek says it\u2019s difficult to quantify the total financial impacts of passengers to the town\u2019s business core.\n\nThat port\u2019s cruise dock is a busy one, having welcomed four ships per week between April and November of 2022, with an estimated 16,500 visitors. American Cruise Lines increased its business at the port in 2023, with five ships now docking there each week, around 20,000 passengers for the year.\n\nEven so, the nearby McMenamins Kalama Harbor Lodge, while convenient, isn\u2019t often frequented by cruise passengers.\n\n\u201cWe see a little bit of a bump in our gift shop and from the crew at times coming in to eat,\u201d said Renee Rank Ignacio, director of marketing at McMenamins. \u201cBut for the most part, the passengers are not coming in to eat and drink.\u201d\n\nIf they come in, it\u2019s to grab merchandise or cans of beer or wine to go, added Ignacio.\n\nThe story is much the same in Camas and Washougal. The Clark County Historical Museum hosted cruise passengers last year when they stopped at the Port of Camas-Washougal.\n\nThe museum\u2019s tour, which will be running again later this year, took passengers to Washougal\u2019s Two Rivers Heritage Museum, Pendleton Mill Store and Captain William Clark Park and then historic downtown Camas for shopping.\n\nThe Two Rivers museum alone saw 1,560 cruise passengers last year.\n\nYet, even though tour guides provided coupons and maps for passengers, museum Executive Director Bradley Richardson heard from Camas businesses that not many saw a significant bump in sales.\n\nRichardson acknowledged it wasn\u2019t what they hoped. But he said they were honored to get the chance to advocate for local businesses rather than a cruise company just hiring a tourism group from outside the area.\n\n\u201cThe hope is we can continue to grow and encourage the guests to shop in historic downtown Camas,\u201d he said.\n\nExcursion sites keep busy\n\nWhile the cruise industry hasn\u2019t yet proved to be a windfall for local retailers, it has had a significant impact for those businesses fortunate enough to be an excursion destination.\n\nTwo of the must-do tours when cruising the Columbia are going to Mount St. Helens and visiting the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center.\n\nThe Mount St. Helens Visitor Center remained consistently busy during last year\u2019s cruise season. The center even brought on more interpretive staff to accommodate the extra visitors and cruise ship passengers, which often arrived in three to four buses at a time.\n\n\u201cWe enjoyed the change, and our colleagues to the south and east of us were welcoming the same folks \u2014 at the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center and the Sacajawea Interpretive Center, both located along the Columbia River,\u201d said Alysa Adams, interpretive ranger at the Mount St. Helens Visitor Center.\n\nThe center held multiple educational ranger programs each day to meet the demand of the tours.\n\nIn the heart of the Gorge, the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center in Stevenson also has passengers bused to its doors. During the cruise season, Jessica Chamberlin, the museum\u2019s visitors manager, estimates passengers make up 70 percent to 80 percent of the museum\u2019s attendees.\n\nThe cruise companies also often set up tasting events at local breweries and wineries, which bring passengers to specific businesses in the area.\n\nEvoke Winery hosted a very successful party for a cruise ship at its winery in Hood River, Ore., said Evoke\u2019s Shelly Kice.\n\nAirfield Estates\u2019 Vancouver Tasting Room hosted two private tasting events for American Empress passengers in the past few weeks. There are two more scheduled for later in the cruise season. It recently got an inquiry for a private event from another cruise line, as well. The events so far haven\u2019t been lucrative, though the business is hoping sales during the events pick up.\n\nJust on Monday the business held 70 tastings for passengers \u2014 all at a reduced rate. There were only a couple of bottles sold, said tasting room manager Jeremy Parker.\n\nDespite not making many sales, the tasting room has been happy to get its name out there.\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019re pretty happy and looking forward to doing more of them,\u201d said Parker.\n\nEffect on ports not yet clear\n\nThe ports say they are happy with the cruise business at their docks.\n\nThe Port of Skamania built its cruise ship dock many years ago for the smaller day cruises and added dolphins, wooden pilings that are used by the longer cruise ships that started cruising the river more recently.\n\n\u201cIt was a way of expanding our economic impact,\u201d said Pat Albaugh, executive director at the Port of Skamania. The port docks around 200 cruise ships each season, though one company recently contracted with the Port of Cascade Locks in Oregon instead.\n\nThere are no numbers on what kind of economic impact the cruise industry has had on Vancouver. Those numbers may be coming in the next year, according to Cliff Myers at Visit Vancouver USA.\n\nThe Port of Camas-Washougal used visitor spending impacts estimated by the cruise lines to estimate economic impacts. That study showed the total economic impact in the community was $2.29 million. The port completed its $1.4 million breakwater access ramps last year.\n\n\u201cI think cruise ships are seeing these developments in these small communities and taking advantage of that, and that\u2019s future demand that I think will continue,\u201d said Derek Jaeger, director of business development and real estate at the Port of Camas-Washougal, pointing to the new waterfront developments in Vancouver, Kalama and Camas-Washougal.\n\nFor Myers at Visit Vancouver USA, the organization is bullish on cruises but with trepidation, lacking actionable information.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say, he said, that passengers are staying overnight in local hotels and shopping and eating at local retailers.\n\nHe questions if retailers would be able to tell that cruise passengers are specifically coming in to shop and eat, saying passengers don\u2019t stick out like some other visitors to the area.\n\n\u201cWe really feel like there\u2019s a lot to be said here, but again, we just need to be smart. We need to point ourselves in the right direction with some information that we don\u2019t have currently,\u201d said Myers."
