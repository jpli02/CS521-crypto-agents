        "content": "Special to the Herald-Tribune\n\nThe Charles & Margery Barancik Foundation is again celebrating the work of Sarasota County educators who go above and beyond.\n\nOn May 5, five educators were greeted by their principal, the interim superintendent, and district leadership during a surprise ceremony where they were named 2023 Ripple Effect Award winners and presented a $5,000 check from the Barancik Foundation.\n\nThe 'Ripple Effect' teachers:\n\n\u00b7 DaVida Dagan of Glenallen Elementary School.\n\n\u00b7 Holly DeWitt of Brookside Middle School.\n\n\u00b7 Diana Eidel of Wilkinson Elementary School.\n\n\u00b7 Chelsie Jacob of Laurel Nokomis Middle School.\n\n\u00b7 Jeff Kahler of Suncoast Polytech High School.\n\n\u201cRecognizing these educators is a highlight of our year,\u201d said Teri A Hansen, president and CEO of the Barancik Foundation. \u201cChuck and Margie often said, \u2018We can\u2019t change the world, but we can change little pieces of it and hope for a ripple effect.\u2019 In this case, the ripple effect these educators are making often means changing the trajectory of students\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nThe Ripple Effect Award launched in 2021 and invites Sarasota County principals to nominate one educator from their school who sets the bar for innovation and creates lasting impacts on their students and peers. Five educators are honored on Charles Barancik's birthday in May and five on Margery Barancik\u2019s birthday in September.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful for the tremendous impact our teachers make on the lives of our students and families,\" said Allison Foster, interim superintendent of Sarasota County Schools. \"It is wonderful that we have partners like the Barancik Foundation to recognize the dedication our teachers give each day. The Ripple Effect Award recipients demonstrate compassion and high-quality best practices that allow our students to achieve success today and into the future.\u201d\n\nSubmitted by Kaitlyn Perez"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nU.Today provides you with an overview of last weekend\u2019s crypto events with the top four news stories.\n\nRipple ally v. SEC takes new turn as commission withdraws request for disgorgement\n\nDefense lawyer James K. Filan recently provided an update regarding the LBRY-SEC case. According to the update, the regulatory body has filed a supplemental brief that amends the relief requested in its opposition to LBRY's motion to \"Limit the Commission's Remedies.\" The SEC also stated it has withdrawn its prior request for disgorgement for reasons it cited as \"LBRY lack of funds and near defunct status.\" However, the commision has asked the court to impose a civil penalty of $111,614 and enjoin LBRY from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act and from conducting unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities, at least until LBRY destroys its holdings of LBC and dissolves, as it promised the court it would.\n\nElon Musk's new meme tweet pushes PEPE up 54%, whales buy trillions of PEPE\n\nOn Saturday, Elon Musk, a centibillionaire known for his love for crypto-related memes, shared a funny picture with Pepe the Frog (the symbol of recently emerged trendy meme coin PEPE) with his followers. Following Musk's post, PEPE surged by 54.7%, according to data shared by CoinMarketCap. The official Pepe Twitter account also quoted Elon Musk's tweet, commenting \"seize the memes of production $PEPE.\" This is not the only crypto that saw an increase in its price thanks to Elon Musk last week. On May 11, the Tesla CEO tweeted a meme allegedly related to Milady Meme Coin (LADYS). After that tweet, the recently launched coin's price skyrocketed as much as 12,056%.\n\nRipple could burn its XRP right now: former executive\n\nMatt Hamilton , Ripple's former director of developer relations, has recently taken to Twitter to join the debate on the fate of Ripple's XRP holdings if the company is required to dispose of them. He made a proposal that could prevent Ripple from flooding the market with XRP. According to Hamilton, Ripple could render all of its future escrow funds inaccessible to anyone, including itself, by disabling the master key on the destination account, thus making them inoperable. This would effectively \"burn\" the tokens and ensure that they could not be used by Ripple or anyone else.\n\nClose to 2 billion SHIB burned this week, price goes up 2.36% in response"

        "content": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming instant payment service, FedNow, will be linked to Metal Blockchain.\n\nOther claimed attributes of FedNow, such as its extremely cheap transaction fees, may pose a challenge to Ripple- or Stellar-like protocols.\n\nAccording to an announcement by the Metal Blockchain team on May 11, the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming instant payment service, FedNow, will be linked to Metal Blockchain. This integration will enable users of Metal to quickly convert funds to stablecoin and vice versa by utilizing FedNow\u2019s \u201csend/receive\u201d feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FedNow service\u2019s partnership with Metal Blockchain for quick fiat and stablecoin conversion marks a major milestone in bridging the barrier between conventional banking and decentralized finance. At the moment, United States citizens can solely make instant payments within the country through third-party applications like Venmo and PayPal or digital wallets for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe platform is undergoing a pilot phase, with over 120 organizations taking part, including recent additions such as U.S. Bank, Exchange Bank, and various payment processors and solution providers.\n\nRipple, a prominent provider of cross-border payments and open-source distributed ledger technology for financial transactions, may be included among the fintech companies that FedNow will utilize. Additionally, Stellar Lumens (XLM), a blockchain-based payment network that offers a quicker and more cost-effective method for executing global payments, might also be among the companies that FedNow will use.\n\nAs per a Metal Blockchain publication, conversations with financial institutions and fintech partners commenced in January. The team has identified several use cases, with a particular emphasis on the requirement for blockchain development resources.\n\nWill The FedNow Be Ripple\u2018s and Stellar Lumens Rival\n\nFollowing the announcement that FedNow will be launched in July. It has gained popularity and begun positioning itself as an alternative to numerous current cross-border payment systems. Such as payment systems like Ripple (XRP) and Stellar Lumens (XLM), as well as a number of stablecoins that make it possible for value to be transferred extremely quickly and cheaply compared to the conventional methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnquestionably, the new payment method will be preferable to the current centralized system of payment. The latter has a cumbersome procedure that, even during business days, requires days to complete payments. Additionally, it is a problem because of the constrained banking hours in general. However, other claimed attributes of FedNow, such as its extremely cheap transaction fees, may pose a challenge to Ripple- or Stellar-like protocols."

        "content": "According to Matt Hamilton, nothing stops Ripple from burning all the XRP stored in the company\u2019s escrow wallet if it wants to.\n\nMatt Hamilton, software developer and former Principal Developer Advocate at Ripple, recently disclosed that Ripple could actually burn all the XRP tokens currently stored in the company\u2019s escrow wallets if it decides to.\n\nHamilton, who worked in the developer relations unit at Ripple for over a year, made this disclosure while addressing comments regarding the company\u2019s XRP tokens and their significance in the ongoing litigation with the US SEC.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to him, Ripple could decide to disable the master key for the accounts that are programmed to receive the escrowed tokens when they are released.\n\nThe escrows are set to release to a particular address. Ripple could at any time disable the master key on the destination account. Thus rendering it inoperable. Ie when the funds released from escrow they\u2019d be inaccessible to anyone. \u2014 Matt Hamilton (@HammerToe) May 14, 2023\n\nThis would make the released tokens inaccessible to anyone, including Ripple.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cRipple could right now publicly and probably render their entire future escrow funds inaccessible to even themselves. To all intents and purposes, \u201cburn them,\u201d Hamilton stressed.\n\nCould Ripple Be Ordered to Burn All XRP in Escrow?\n\nHamilton\u2019s disclosure came on the back of an argument triggered by the SEC vs. LBRY lawsuit. Notably, in its lawsuit against LBRY Inc, the SEC requested that the court prohibit LBRY from carrying out any offerings related to digital assets until it has destroyed all the LBRY Credits (LBC) tokens it currently possesses.\n\nAn XRP proponent asked David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s CTO if Ripple must do the same with the escrowed XRP tokens. A debate ensued, with some parties claiming that neither the court nor the SEC can make Ripple burn the escrowed tokens.\n\nOthers pointed out that XRPL validators could vote to burn the tokens if a consensus is reached, citing previous disclosures from Schwartz. As previously reported by The Crypto Basic, Schwartz confirmed in December 2020 that if validators vote to have the escrowed XRP tokens burned, Ripple will have no choice but to burn them.\n\nResponding to the recent remarks on validator consensus, some individuals further stressed that Ripple could influence validators on the XRPL to vote in favor of the burn if the judge orders it.\n\nPro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan disclosed that while the judge can make such an order, the validators would not be bound by it. Morgan emphasized that if Judge Analisa Torres extends the order to XRPL validators, she will have to give them a hearing before they can be bound to obey it.\n\nRecall that Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, affirmed in an interview in April 2021 that the Silicon Valley firm could consider burning all the XRP tokens in its escrow wallets if the move would \u201cmake sense for the XRP ecosystem.\u201d"

        "content": "Disavowing any conflict of interest, Fox Corporation\u2019s powerhouse law firm distanced itself from ex-host Tucker Carlson as a client in a discrimination lawsuit brought by his former producer Abby Grossberg.\n\nShortly before Fox\u2019s settlement with Dominion, Grossberg sued the network and Carlson in New York and Delaware, claiming pervasive religious and gender bias. Grossberg also accused Fox\u2019s attorneys of coaching her into giving \u201ccoerced\u201d and misleading testimony that would make her and host Maria Bartiromo the network\u2019s \u201csacrificial female lambs.\u201d\n\nFox later entered into a $787.5 million deal with Dominion on the eve of trial, but Grossberg\u2019s litigation endured.\n\nOn Friday, Fox\u2019s law firm Baker McKenzie \u2014 which has dozens of offices internationally and reported $3.1 billion in revenue in 2021 \u2014 affirmed in court that it had \u201cnot entered an appearance on behalf of Mr. Carlson on this Court\u2019s docket.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Carlson will be represented by separate counsel in this matter, who will enter an appearance reflecting as much,\u201d the firm\u2019s partner Paul Evans wrote.\n\nGrossberg\u2019s attorney Parisis G. Filippatos called that statement distancing the firm from Carlson \u201cpatently misleading and false.\u201d\n\nIn an email on April 10, 2023, Evans told Filippatos that he could now \u201cnow confirm\u201d that Baker McKenzie would \u201calso be representing\u201d Carlson and other individual defendants. Evans did not appear to file a notice of appearance indicating this to the court.\n\nSome two days after that email, a Delaware judge sanctioned the network\u2019s legal team for not telling him the full story about Rupert Murdoch\u2019s role in Fox News, as opposed to the Fox Corporation.\n\n\u201cI need people to tell me the truth,\u201d Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis scolded on April 12. \u201cAnd by the way, omission is a lie.\u201d\n\nGrossberg\u2019s legal team cited this exchange in a footnote.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking that this is not the first litigation this year \u2014 involving both parties in some manner \u2014 where Fox, through its attorneys, has chosen to be less than fully honest and truthful with the Court,\u201d Filippatos wrote in a footnote. \u201cThus, the evasive and deceptive conduct of Fox\u2019s attorneys before your honor at the outset of this case is particularly troubling on the heels of Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis\u2019s widely-reported stern rebuke of the Fox attorneys in the Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox matter for having made certain statements the veracity of which was very much in doubt.\u201d\n\nGrossberg\u2019s legal team asked U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman to order Carlson to obtain new counsel before the next hearing scheduled for June 15, 2023, one month from today.\n\n\u201cFor all of the foregoing reasons we respectfully reiterate our prior request that Mr. Carlson be ordered to obtain suitable counsel prior to the June 15th Preliminary Conference, as well as in advance of his obligation to answer or otherwise move with respect to plaintiff\u2019s pleading on or before June 16, 2023,\u201d the filing concludes.\n\nFox didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Furman ordered Fox and Carlson to respond quickly to that request. Fox must file a response by Wednesday, and Carlson must enter a notice of appearance that day.\n\nHave a tip we should know? [email protected]"
