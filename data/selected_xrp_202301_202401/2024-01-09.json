Completion of damages-related discovery is Feb. 12. I'm surprised we haven't seen any SEC discovery motions filed given how hostile this litigation has been. I would expect to see one filed at least a week or so...1/3 \u2014 Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) January 8, 2024\n\nJeremy Hogan, an attorney and XRP enthusiast, believes the same, expressing concern about the unusual quietness.\n\nRispoli feels that the unusual calm in the lawsuit might suggest that the SEC is moving on to other endeavors or shakedowns.\n\nKey date nears\n\nThe Ripple lawsuit has now reached the remedies stage, in which the court will decide which, if any, remedies to impose in light of the decision that certain institutional sales constituted sales of securities.\n\nIn light of this, the next key date in the lawsuit is Feb. 12, 2024, which will mark the completion of remedies-related discovery.\n\nRispoli expressed surprise about the SEC's discovery motions, which have yet to be filed, given the significance of the legal tussle. He anticipates seeing at least one motion filed a week or so before the deadline.\n\nThe legal expert predicts one of two scenarios: first, the SEC gets the discovery it wants, reviews it and the parties finally settle. But, second, if this fails to happen, Rispoli hints at a scenario whereby discovery drags on through the remedies briefing, which concludes on April 29 with a ruling likely in the early summer.\n\nRegardless of all this, Ripple predicts that in 2024, the last bit of the SEC's misguided lawsuit will finally come to an end."

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nStory Highlights The SEC's lack of recent motions is unusual, sparking speculation about potential settlement talks with Ripple.\n\nTwo possible outcomes emerge: a deal after February's discovery review, or a longer legal battle.\n\nWhile a settlement offers hope, the quiet phase could also lead to a swift escalation of the case.\n\nFred Rispoli, a respected legal expert and dedicated XRP supporter, comments on the ongoing SEC vs Ripple lawsuit. He\u2019s intrigued by the current lack of activity in the legal proceedings. With the damages-related discovery phase ending on February 12, Rispoli offers insights into what might come next.\n\nIs this the calm before the storm? Find out below.\n\nWhat\u2019s With SEC\u2019s Silence?\n\nAs the SEC vs Ripple case unfolds, Rispoli notes the absence of any filed SEC discovery motions. Given the usually confrontational nature of such litigation, this silence is noteworthy. As the February 12 deadline nears, Rispoli considers two possible outcomes.\n\n#XRP #XRPCommunity#SECvsRipple has been quiet\u2026too quiet? Completion of damages-related discovery is Feb. 12. I'm surprised we haven't seen any SEC discovery motions filed given how hostile this litigation has been. I would expect to see one filed at least a week or so\u20261/3 \u2014 Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) January 8, 2024\n\nRispoli speculates that the absence of SEC motions could suggest an unspoken agreement between Ripple and the SEC. This could pave the way for a settlement post the review of the desired discovery, potentially bringing a resolution to the prolonged legal saga.\n\nWhat are the Potential Outcomes?\n\nRispoli suggests the SEC\u2019s lack of motions might indicate a possible understanding between Ripple and the SEC. This could set the stage for a settlement after both parties review the forthcoming discovery, possibly concluding the prolonged legal matter.\n\nAlternatively, if the SEC chooses a different path, Rispoli envisions a longer legal process. He anticipates the SEC obtaining its desired discovery, leading to a detailed damages briefing scheduled to end on April 29.\n\nA final ruling might emerge in the early summer, with potential consequences for the SEC, considering their recent legal challenges.\n\nRead More: Bill Morgan Clarifies Ripple\u2019s $238M XRP Sales: Debunking the Dumping Myth\n\nBalancing Hope and Caution\n\nWhile Rispoli hopes the SEC recognizes the obstacles Ripple presents, he also points out the risks of this quiet phase: a swift progression of the case, potentially escalating to the 2nd Circuit Court.\n\n\u2026And the Wait Continues\n\nRispoli\u2019s assessment focuses on either a settlement or an extended legal dispute, each with implications for Ripple and the SEC. As the February 12 deadline approaches, the crypto community watches closely for the next developments in this legal battle.\n\nCurrently, XRP shows a 1.6% increase, trading at $0.5719. Over the last 24 hours, trading volume decreased by 18.5%, resulting in a total market cap of $30.9 billion, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Ripple."

        "title": "Here\u2019s What Can Cause a Ripple (XRP) Price Rally This Year (Not Just the SEC Lawsuit) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nFinancial expert Linda P. Jones discusses Ripple\u2019s XRP, advising patience for investors based on upcoming events.\n\nFactors influencing XRP\u2019s value include Ripple\u2019s company developments, sector regulation, and market dynamics.\n\nVarious analysts provide diverse, bullish and bearish predictions for XRP\u2019s future price.\n\nRipple (XRP) to be Fueled by These Factors\n\nLinda P. Jones \u2013 an author, wealth mentor, and speaker \u2013 recently touched upon Ripple\u2019s XRP and its chances to rally in the near future. She noted its not-so-impressive performance as of late but urged investors to be patient and await certain events that might have a significant impact on the asset.\n\nJones argued that the most important factor is the outcome of the Ripple v. SEC case. As CryptoPotato previously reported, the trial between the two entities is scheduled for April 23, 2024. Ripple seemingly has the upper hand after securing three major (yet partial) court wins last year.\n\nThe financial expert added that a potential Ripple IPO could also affect XRP\u2019s price. However, she warned that it could not go live before a final settlement between the company and America\u2019s securities regulator.\n\nImplementing comprehensive rules in the crypto sector was outlined as the third essential element. In her view, regulation may be enforced in 2025, but XRP\u2019s price could react beforehand. Jones made an interesting prediction, claiming that 2024 would be the last year when memecoins would be able to explode since legislation could negatively affect them:\n\n\u201cThis is going to be the last year for memecoins to explode. XRP is not a memecoin, but there is a lot of speculation with memecoins right now. And some people have said this is the last year for that kind of speculation on those memecoins that don\u2019t really have utility because next year we are going to get legislation which will favor coins with utility.\u201d\n\nRising institutional adoption and the upcoming Bitcoin halving are supposedly the last two factors that could boost XRP\u2019s value in the following months. The latter is an event that slashes the miners\u2019 reward in half and is expected to occur in April. Those willing to learn more about the halving could check our video below:\n\nSubsequent supply reduction could result in price appreciation for Bitcoin if the demand stays the same or increases. Historically, many of the altcoins have followed BTC\u2019s uptrend numerous times, meaning XRP could also be among the ascending ones.\n\nPrice Tags for XRP\n\nThe X (Twitter) users Dark Defender and EGRAG CRYPTO also touched upon XRP, setting extremely bullish price targets. The former maintained that the global cryptocurrency market capitalization could skyrocket above $23 trillion in a year, with Ripple\u2019s coin soaring to $13.72.\n\nDespite the bullish sentiment in the sector as of the moment, reaching that level by 2025 seems a bit unrealistic. Currently, the global market cap is around $1.8 trillion, whereas its all-time high stood at \u201cjust\u201d $3 trillion during the bull run in 2021.\n\nEGRAG CRYPTO was even more optimistic, arguing that XRP has a chance to mirror its explosive performance from 2017 and jump to the ridiculous $220.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitgolder \u2013 an analyst on TradingView \u2013 presented a bearish scenario in which the asset\u2019s price could plummet to $0.07 in the following months.\n\n\u201cXRP is losing strength, it failed to make a new high in the least bull run and is now slowly bleeding out. Its going to take a while to bleed out because of how many bag holders there are and how much silly youtubers keep pumping this thing. Its unfortunate that many are going to lose their shirts on this thing,\u201d the analyst stated."

        "title": "Ripple CTO Says Burning XRP Escrow Would Have No Real Benefits - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "In a recent discussion on X, the Ripple CTO Chief David Schwartz emphasized that the burning of the company\u2019s entire XRP escrow would not bring the benefits the XRP community anticipates.\n\nSchwartz said this while responding to questions from the XRP community about how Ripple manages its XRP holdings.\n\nSeveral XRP holders have raised concerns about Ripple\u2019s escrowed XRP tokens, with some even suggesting that the monthly releases put pressure on the token.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA community member with the X pseudonym \u201cGPDBurnTheEscrow\u201d recently raised this issue while responding to a disclosure from Mr. Huber, an on-chain sleuth. He expressed concerns about whether Ripple\u2019s main focus was consistently selling XRP.\n\nIn response, Schwartz explained that Ripple could either maintain their current XRP holdings or actively reduce them. According to the Ripple CTO, there is no third option, and the company\u2019s initial plan from its establishment was to decrease its XRP bag swiftly.\n\nBurning the XRP Escrow Would Yield No Benefit\n\nThe community member, whose pseudonym indicates he advocates for incineration of the escrowed tokens, asked Schwartz if the idea of burning the tokens was not to be considered as an option.\n\nReplying to this proposition, Schwartz expressed skepticism about its feasibility and questioned the actual benefits it might bring.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any set of events that would lead that to happen that\u2019s even remotely probable. I also don\u2019t think it would have any real benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nI can't think of any set of events that would lead that to happen that's even remotely probable. I also don't think it would have any real benefits. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 8, 2024\n\nUpon Schwartz\u2019s disclosure, another community member shared concerns about XRP holders potentially facing challenges for an extended period until the escrow is depleted.\n\nThe Stellar Case\n\nSchwartz countered this viewpoint by referencing past arguments in 2018. He called attention to the fact that most proponents argued back then that reducing the token\u2019s supply would not drastically impact its market cap but rather help bolster price upswings.\n\nNotably, Stellar, a project similar to the XRP Ledger and founded by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, initially had a supply of 100 billion tokens.\n\nConcerns emerged about the extensive nature of the asset\u2019s supply. The Stellar Development Foundation burned 55 billion tokens ($5.5 billion) in November 2019.\n\nIn response, the price of XLM only rallied by a meager rate to $0.09 and then immediately dumped, closing November 2019 with a surprising 12% decline.\n\nSchwartz called attention to this event, arguing that the Stellar burn proved that the narrative of burns bolstering prices was \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, lots of people argued that a reduction in supply could not lower the market cap and so price would have to go up significantly. The Stellar burn proved that to be nonsense. I wouldn't assume the economics work some particular way without really thinking about it first. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 8, 2024\n\nThe Ripple CTO aimed to provide a more detailed analysis but restrained himself due to potential inaccuracies and legal constraints. Schwartz encouraged community members to use their imagination to understand the tokenomics of XRP.\n\nGPDBurnTheEscrow acknowledged and appreciated Schwartz\u2019s engagement with the community but lamented a sense of pessimism within the XRP community.\n\nSchwartz responded by sharing two enduring beliefs. Firstly, prices are generally rational, with expectations already factored into the value. Secondly, he noted that any radical change that is not clearly beneficial is likely viewed negatively by the market."

        "title": "Scientists outline a bold solution to climate change, biodiversity loss, social injustice - Phys.org",
        "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: CC0 Public Domain\n\nAn international team of scientists led by Oregon State University researchers has used a novel 500-year dataset to frame a \"restorative\" pathway through which humanity can avoid the worst ecological and social outcomes of climate change.\n\nIn addition to charting a possible new course for society, the researchers say their \"paradigm shifting\" plan can support climate modeling and discussion by providing a set of actions that strongly emphasize social and economic justice as well as environmental sustainability.\n\nOregon State's William Ripple, former OSU postdoctoral researcher Christopher Wolf and collaborators argue their scenario should be included in climate models along with the five \"shared socioeconomic pathways,\" or SSPs, that are used by the U.N.\"s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n\"We understand that our proposed scenario may be a major challenge to implement given current trends in emissions, a lack of political will and widespread social denial, but its merits can't even be honestly debated if it's not included in the suite of options,\" said Ripple, distinguished professor of ecology in the OSU College of Forestry.\n\n\"We're arguing for radical incrementalism: achieving massive change through small, short-term steps. And we're offering a much-needed contrast to many other climate scenarios, which may be more aligned with the status quo, which isn't working.\"\n\nRipple and co-authors from the United States, the Netherlands and Australia present their restorative pathway in a paper published in Environmental Research Letters. They say the pathway is inspired by a unique compilation of Earth system variables that vividly illustrate how humanity's resource demands have exploded since 1850, indicating ecological overshoot.\n\n\"The supporting data underscore the urgent need for action,\" said Wolf, now a scientist with Corvallis-based Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Associates. \"The growth in human population, gross domestic product and energy consumption, primarily reliant on fossil fuels, has led to an extraordinary surge in greenhouse gas emissions, dramatically altering land use and triggering a massive biodiversity decline.\"\n\nThe authors note that current climate change modeling relies on multiple assumptions and factors related to policy options and societal developments. An international team of climate scientists, economists and energy systems modelers developed the SSPs, which are used to derive greenhouse gas emissions scenarios under different sets of policies that assume continued and significant GDP growth through 2100.\n\n\"The SSPs describe plausible developments that in the future would lead to different challenges for climate change mitigation and adaptation,\" Wolf said.\n\n\"They're based on five narratives that describe alternative socioeconomic developments, some more sustainable than others. Our scenario focuses on reducing the consumption of primary resources to a level that keeps environmental pressures within planetary boundaries, with per capita GDP stabilizing over time.\"\n\nWolf, Ripple and collaborators took a long-term look back at a range of variables: fossil fuel emissions, human population, GDP, land use, greenhouse gas concentrations, global temperature, vertebrate wildlife species abundance, income inequality and meat production.\n\nCollectively, the data paint a comprehensive picture of the profound changes Earth has undergone, say the authors, who include Jillian Gregg of Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Associates, Detlef P. van Vuuren with the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and Manfred Lenzen of the University of Sydney.\n\n\"The income share variable extends back to 1820 and shows how the top 10% have consistently received at least 50% of all income, illustrating global economic inequality over the long term,\" Ripple said.\n\n\"The restorative pathway would represent a more equitable and resilient world with a focus on nature preservation as a natural climate solution; societal well-being and quality of life; equality and high levels of education for girls and women, resulting in low fertility rates and higher standards of living; and a rapid transition toward renewable energy.\"\n\nUnlike some of the current shared socioeconomic pathways, the restorative pathway does not rely on the development of carbon capture technologies, nor does it assume continued economic growth as the SSPs do.\n\n\"By prioritizing large-scale societal change, our proposed pathway could limit warming much more effectively than pathways that support rising resource consumption by wealthy nations,\" Ripple said. \"We aim to bend the curves on a wide range of planetary vital signs with a holistic vision for addressing climate change, biodiversity loss and socioeconomic injustice. Our work presents a case for how humanity can embark on the journey of saving the world from these environmental and social crises.\"\n\nIn October 2023, Ripple, Wolf and 10 other U.S. and global scientists published research in BioScience that showed the Earth's vital signs have worsened beyond anything humans have yet seen, to the point that life on the planet is imperiled.\n\nRipple is also the co-author of another recent BioScience paper, that examines climate change and the related biodiversity crisis from a cosmic perspective using \"long-term planetary thinking,\" he said.\n\nMore information: An environmental and socially just climate mitigation pathway for a planet in peril, Environmental Research Letters (2024).
