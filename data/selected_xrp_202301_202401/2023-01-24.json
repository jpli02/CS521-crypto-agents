        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe developers of UDPN describe it as equivalent to SWIFT.\n\nSome of the major banks expected to participate in the pilot phase include HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Deutsche Bank.\n\nA Chinese firm is developing a new payment system interoperable with stablecoins and CBDCs \u2013 that acts as a link for central banks to transfer and swap regulated digital currencies \u2013 recently unveiled at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nDubbed the Universal Digital Payments Network (UDPN) and developed by Red Date Technology, the new system would reportedly work with the private sector, unlike the rival Ripple network, which mostly serves central banks. According to the announcement, several major banks, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and Standard Chartered, have been selected to participate in the pilot phase.\n\nUDPN, in particular, noted that it would not work with decentralized public cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, perhaps underscoring its efforts to comply with the ongoing Chinese ban on cryptocurrencies. Beijing is keen to prevent any form of capital outflow in the form of stablecoins or digital assets.\n\nThe Commercialization of UDPN is Scheduled for Mid-2023\n\nPer the project\u2019s whitepaper, UDPN is planned to debut with two separate stablecoins, with the pilot commercialization set for mid-year. In the near term, the project team expects the network to support most of the global CBDCs and regulated fiat-based stablecoins. The system would also be extended to include the interoperability of the traditional messaging networks.\n\nUDPN has a common messaging standard in multiple digital currency systems, which is essential in enhancing interoperability in CBDC and stablecoins. The system will also accelerate access to a fully decentralized economy by commercial banks with a system managed by an alliance of financial institutions and fintech firms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechnically, UDPN would have four main nodes \u2013 the validator nodes and the transactions nodes \u2013 all operated on-chain. The validator nodes would have a hyperledger and governance systems. The next set of nodes, which would operate off-chain, is the business and the transaction nodes. Compared to the SWIFT network, which has led to an increase in cross-border and inter-bank transactions, UDPN is touted by its developers as an important link in the future of digital currencies."

        "content": "With the likelihood of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit ending soon, users are now speculating on the future price of XRP.\n\nThe advances in the XRPLedger and the growth of the ecosystem will add to XRP price growth.\n\nWith the likelihood of the ongoing legal brawl between blockchain payments firm Ripple Labs Inc and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) coming to an end in a short time, there has been a lot of speculation on what the future holds for the price of XRP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been quite a number of speculations as to what the outcome of the case will be. There are observers who believe Ripple would have settled the case out of court but the regulator is unwilling to declare that XRP is not a security. The Brad Garlinghouse-led company is treading on a very cautious path as any form of settlement without legally defining the status of the XRP coin can stir up another lawsuit sometime in the future.\n\nThe recent victory of the SEC over LBRY, a protocol that says it is doing to publishing what Bitcoin does to money, has given the regulator a bigger impetus to believe it can tap a good victory over Ripple.\n\nRipple remains convinced that it will beat the SEC with over 3,000 Amicus Briefs showing the usage of XRP is limited to payment utility.\n\nFuture of XRP price\n\nXRP coin is currently changing hands at $0.4219, up by 8.89 percent over the trailing 7-day period. The ongoing lawsuit has greatly impacted the price of digital currency which plunged to its lowest price point of $0.2906 in the past 52 weeks.\n\nOne of the first bearish pulldowns for XRP was the fact that top trading platforms including Coinbase delisted the digital currency for trading on their brokerage, further contributing to the Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubts (FUD) that engulfed the asset in the first few months of the lawsuit.\n\nWith the current realities and the potential of Ripple beating the SEC, many are optimistic the price of the asset can soar into the thousands in the next few years. While there are more conservative price predictions ranging from $5 to $10, the community is riled up that the end to the lawsuit will stir more exchange relisting, and XRP can finally take its rightful position amongst the high-priced cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe potential for the XRP price to grow will not only be fueled by the fundamentals bothering on the end of the ongoing legal brawl, but also by the technical impact of the embrace of the XRPLedger.\n\nChecks feature on XRPLedger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRipple is branded as a payment systems platform that is serving users around the world to foster cross-border financial settlement. In fulfilling its core plans, Ripple is integrating new features on the XRPLedger, the platform where its payment transactions are being facilitated.\n\nOne core feature that just went live on the XRPLedger is the revamped Checks Feature, an amendment that went live without the approval of the Ripple firm. The Checks feature is not entirely new but this new feature enables the sender to issue a check for a specified amount, while the recipient can redeem the check to receive the specified amount.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "title": "Sea Otter Recovery Is Sending Ripples through the Ecosystem - Hakai Magazine",
        "content": "Article body copy\n\nGretchen Roffler recalls looking out on the waterfront in Alaska\u2019s Katmai National Park and Preserve as three wolves came into view, then disappeared behind some rocks. When the predators returned, all three were gripping the same limp sea otter between their jaws. Working together, the wolves tore the otter to pieces. \u201cIt was like a tug of war,\u201d says Roffler, a wildlife biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.\n\nRoffler and her colleagues paid close attention; they needed to document the June 2021 event in detail. After all, Roffler believes, this was \u201cone of the first observations of wolves killing sea otters.\u201d\n\nSea otters were extirpated from Alaska in 1830, but their reintroduction over the past few decades has been highly successful. The marine mammal\u2019s resurgence means that in Alaska sea otters and wolves are now inhabiting the same environments for the first time in the modern scientific record. This meeting of historical predator and prey is having important consequences\u2014especially for the region\u2019s deer.\n\nScientists tend to think that a wolf population\u2019s size is dictated by the availability of ungulate prey like deer and moose. But on the Alaska coast, scientists like Roffler are increasingly documenting cases of coastal wolves munching on marine mammals. In fact, on Pleasant Island, near Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Roffler and her colleagues\u2019 analysis of wolf scat has shown that the local wolves have almost entirely switched their diet from deer to sea otters.\n\nRather than the wolves leaving the deer alone, though, Roffler says that this new source of nutrients has kept the wolf population so healthy that it has wiped out the region\u2019s deer.\n\nBy fixing Alaska coastal wolves with GPS collars to see where they were traveling and hunting, and by analyzing wolf scat and hair samples collected between 2015 and 2021, Roffler and her colleagues retraced the changes that have taken place.\n\nTheir research shows that sea otters first recolonized the area around Pleasant Island in the early 2000s, while wolves landed on the island in 2013. The deer population crashed in 2015, and by 2016 the wolves were mostly eating sea otters.\n\nWhile wolves scavenging the occasional sea otter may not be unexpected, Roffler says it\u2019s surprising that a pack could completely switch its diet and continue to maintain a healthy population on a small island devoid of deer. \u201cWe assumed what would happen is that the wolves would eat a lot of deer and potentially deplete the population, and then the wolves would either die off or leave,\u201d she says.\n\nThe scientists are curious how common this kind of prey switching has been in other areas along the coast where sea otters have also rebounded. They\u2019re also interested in how wolves learn to hunt sea otters\u2014and whether it might be a behavior that can catch on between wolf packs.\n\nSo far, Roffler says it is too soon to predict whether wolf populations growing fat on sea otters could spell trouble for deer elsewhere as it has on Pleasant Island, but they suspect it would only have a similar effect on other relatively isolated small islands where wolves have easy access to sea otters.\n\nChris Darimont, a conservation biologist from the Raincoast Conservation Foundation who was not involved in the study, says that as well as helping us understand how the ecosystem is changing, this kind of work also offers a window into history\u2014before the sea otters were wiped out by hunters. \u201cIn a way, we\u2019re having a glimpse into the past by studying something that\u2019s recovering now.\u201d"

        "title": "'the ripple, the wave that carried me home' soars amid a tidal wave of emotion, outrage in Goodman's searing production - Chicago Sun-Times",
        "content": "On the surface, Christina Anderson\u2019s engrossing drama \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home\u201d is about the fight to integrate public swimming pools in the fictional suburban town of Beacon, Kansas. But like water itself, there are depths here that defy cut-and-dried boundaries.\n\nAs Anderson points out in passages that sometimes ripple toward poetry, water is both destroyer and redeemer, a font of life and a taker of it. On stage as in life, the movement to integrate public pools in the 1960s and \u201870s was marked by violent history and lethal racism. But there is also a buoyant sense of joy flowing through the world premiere running through Feb. 12 at the Goodman Theatre, in a co-production with Berkeley Repertory Theatre.\n\n\u2018the ripple, the wave that carried me home\u2019\n\nUntitled\n\nWhen: Through Feb. 12\n\n\n\nWhere: Goodman Owen Theatre, 170 N. Dearborn\n\n\n\nTickets: $15 - $45\n\n\n\nInfo:\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough Feb. 12$15 - $45Info: goodmantheatre.org\n\nThe 105-minute, intermission-free drama leans too heavily on exposition at times, but when the script moves from narration to action, Anderson\u2019s drama resonates with the primal force of the tides.\n\nThe plot begins in 1991. Janice (Christiana Clark) is in Ohio, intentionally far from her hometown of Beacon and barely speaking to her mother Helen (Aneisa Hicks). She\u2019s forced to reckon with her past when community organizer Young Chipper Ambitious Black Woman (Brianna Buckley) calls from Beacon with news that a pool has been named after Janice\u2019s father, Edwin (Ronald L. Conner). Young Chipper is insistent that Janice speak in his honor at the ceremony.\n\nThe request sends Janice down a spiral of memory. Edwin was \u201cthe face\u201d of the movement to make Beacon\u2019s swimming pools accessible to Black children, but Helen was the warrior engine propelling the activism. Throughout, Anderson uses the family \u2014 which also includes glamorous, adventurous Aunt Gayle (also portrayed by Buckley) \u2014 to illustrate with cut-glass clarity the violence that met the desegregation attempts.\n\nAs a kid, Janice is proud of her father and bonds with her mother during pre-dawn lap swimming at a town some 30 miles off. But her relationship with her parents \u2014 and swimming \u2014 is shattered one morning during a devastating confrontation after she and Helen leave the pool. To say more would entail spoilers, but know this: The silent scene where the break occurs bears witness to centuries of violent racism. It is terrifying, enraging and unforgettable.\n\nBy 1991, Janice hates the very taste of water. Her journey through trauma into healing is evocative of the ocean itself \u2014 rough waters, transcendent beauty, perilous rocks, peaceful shores, but danger never that far.\n\nChristiana Clark (from left), Brianna Buckley, Ronald L. Conner and Aneisa J. Hicks in Christina Anderson\u2019s \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home\u201d at the Goodman Theatre. Liz Lauren\n\nDirector Jackson Gay\u2019s staging pulls the audience in and doesn\u2019t let go until a final, ebullient water aerobics class that has the vibe of a beach and the energy of a dance floor.\n\nClark\u2019s Janice effectively moves from wide-eyed child in the 1960s to disillusioned teen in the 1970s to conflicted adult in the 1990s. As Helen, Hicks is indelible. In one searing, silent scene (with movement by Erika Chong Shuch), Anderson bears explicit witness to the shattering extent of Helen\u2019s sacrifices. You\u2019ll want to look away, but Hicks makes bearing witness the only choice.\n\nConner shows his range early on, as Edwin recalls the time he and a few other kids broke into the pool for white kids, as panicking white parents chaotically yanked their children from the water. After Edwin and his friends escaped, the pool was closed for three days so it could be drained and disinfected.\n\nBuckley\u2019s wise, acerbic Aunt Gayle is the kind of relative everyone needs as kin. Her Young Chipper Ambitious Black Woman is played for comic relief, until a scene that transpires in the wake of the 1992 acquittals of the police officers beating Rodney King. As talking heads drone in the background Young Chipper moves from comic relief to a woman of substance.\n\nTodd Rosenthal\u2019s set is a detriment. It\u2019s essentially a swimming pool/deck with a trophy case that slides back and forth every time the scene moves anywhere else. There\u2019s far too much sliding, resulting in an environment that makes the transitions distracting and choppy.\n\nMontana Levi Blanco\u2019s period costumes, on the other hand, are meticulously recreated works of art, from Helen\u2019s midi-skirts and stacked heel clogs to Aunt Gayle\u2019s shimmery lounge attire.\n\nAnderson ends the play on a redemptive, celebratory note, the three women in bathing suits, splashing, singing and dancing in a testimony to resilience and the endlessly healing powers of the very substance that comprises some 60 percent of our very bodies.\n\n"
