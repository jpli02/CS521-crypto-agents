        "title": "Here's Why April Will Be a Crucial Month For Ripple and XRP - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "April 2024 will be a crucial month for Ripple and XRP as the crypto payments company continues its legal tussle with the SEC and Zakinov.\n\nAs 2024 has started with renewed optimism for crypto enthusiasts, many investors are eager to know what the new year holds for them. For the XRP community, April 2024 will be a crucial month for the cryptocurrency and Ripple Labs.\n\nZakinov and SEC Legal Battles\n\nThis is mainly because April marks the month when XRP and Ripple could see interesting developments in two major legal tussles. Notably, Ripple is currently embroiled in lawsuits against the U.S. SEC and a group of XRP investors led by Vladi Zakinov.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBoth lawsuits allege that Ripple violated securities laws by raising funds via the sale of XRP. Although the motion hearing in the Zakinov Vs. Ripple case is slated for January 11, 2024, the case\u2019s trial is expected to commence on April 15, 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, the remedies litigation in the SEC Vs. Ripple lawsuit will linger till April 2024.\n\nAccording to the court\u2019s schedule, the final motion with respect to the remedies litigation is expected to be filed on April 29, 2024. Notably, Ripple will file its opposition to the SEC\u2019s remedies brief on April 12, 2024. By April 29, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall file a reply to the defendants\u2019 opposition.\n\nUpcoming SEC v. Ripple Remedies Litigation\n\nFor context, in July 2023, a federal court issued the highly anticipated summary judgment in the lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile the court ruled that Ripple violated the law via the institutional sales of XRP, it declared that programmatic sales and other distributions do not constitute securities as alleged by the SEC.\n\nConsequently, the court scheduled a remedies litigation, which will officially begin in February 2024 and linger until April. The remedies litigation pertains to the potential fine that Ripple could pay for selling XRP to institutional investors.\n\nIt is worth noting that developments in these upcoming litigations could have massive implications on the price of XRP, which is currently trading around $0.56."

        "title": "We Asked ChatGPT if Ripple (XRP) Can Become the Biggest Altcoin in 2024 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP saw a significant price rally in 2023, and its future success depends on several factors, including technological advancements in cross-border payments.\n\nLegal developments, particularly Ripple\u2019s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC, are critical in determining XRP\u2019s future. The outcome could significantly impact investor confidence and the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAnalysts and experts have varying predictions for XRP\u2019s future price, with some laying out extremely optimistic forecasts.\n\nThe Answer Depends on These Conditions\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, XRP can become the largest alternative coin in 2024, assuming multiple factors are in play. Substantial technological advancements of Ripple\u2019s underlying technology were outlined as the some of the most important ones. XRP is used in cross-border payments, and further adoption in that field could positively impact its price.\n\nLegal and regulatory developments are next in line. Recall that Ripple is involved in a lawsuit with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and currently has the upper hand after securing three partial court wins last year. The grand trial is scheduled for April this year, and its outcome could have a major effect on the entire cryptocurrency sector.\n\nA decisive victory for Ripple might boost investor confidence and trigger a bull run for XRP, whereas the opposite ruling could lead to the implementation of strict rules and push the brakes on the market.\n\nThe performance of other digital assets and the emergence of new projects could also play a role. The other factors the AI-powered chatbot mentioned were global economic conditions, community support, and key possible partnerships.\n\nXRP is currently the fifth-largest altcoin, with a market capitalization of almost $31 billion. Ethereum (ETH) is first with over $270 billion, meaning Ripple\u2019s coin has a long way to go before reaching the top.\n\nOptimistic XRP Bets\n\nSome analysts and experts have already predicted that XRP could reach unseen levels in the near future, thus climbing the altcoin ladder. The X (Twitter) user EGRAG CRYPTO, for example, outlined the token\u2019s 20X rally in 2021 when the sector was booming and noted that the progress occurred despite the \u201cpesky\u201d lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC.\n\nFollowing the company\u2019s court success, the analyst expects XRP\u2019s price to skyrocket to as high as $27 during the next potential bull market.\n\nPrior to that, EGRAG CRYPTO envisioned the asset to explode to the ridiculous, to say the least, level of $2,500 by 2027.\n\nThe TradingView analyst Oaksacorn and the X user CrediBull have also put their names among the bulls. The former set a price target of $43, while the latter thinks XRP could hit $470."

        "content": "XRP price has been witnessing bearish sentiment for the past four days following a near 20% crash.\n\nGrayscale announced that it would be removing Polygon (MATIC) from its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC).\n\nRipple (XRP) and Avalanche (AVAX) were added to the Fund as part of January rebalancing owing to positive Q4 2023 reviews.\n\nXRP price is expected to witness a bullish 2024 following a positive end to 2023, and Grayscale might fuel this fire. The world\u2019s largest digital asset manager announced the rebalancing of its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), making crucial inclusions and omissions to major cryptocurrencies.\n\nGrayscale adds Ripple\n\nGrayscale, in a press release on Friday, announced that it would be removing Polygon (MATIC) and adding Ripple (XRP) and Avalanche (AVAX) to its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). Updating its Fund Component weightings of the GDLC Grayscale noted,\n\n\u201cFollowing the court\u2019s decision, major digital asset trading platforms announced that they would once again list XRP on their platforms, and subsequently, XRP met the inclusion criteria of the DLCS Index.\n\nThe GLDC index has thus been adjusted to hold these large market cap assets with their respective weightage as follows:-\n\nBitcoin (BTC) - 69.15%\n\nEthereum (ETH) - 21.90%\n\nSolana (SOL) - 3.65%\n\nRipple (XRP) - 2.54%\n\nCardano (ADA) - 1.62%\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) - 1.14%\n\nDespite the decision being a positive development for the altcoin, the digital asset did not respond accordingly, owing to the bearish sentiment in the crypto market at the moment.\n\nXRP price sees further decline\n\nXRP price is trading at $0.568 at the time of writing after declining by more than 3% in the past 24 hours. As a result of this correction, the altcoin lost the support of the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nThis was the last crucial level of support after the digital asset had already lost the 50- and 100-day EMA three days ago when the XRP price nearly crashed by 20% owing to the Matrixport FUD of SEC rejecting the spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Trading at a two-month low, the altcoin is presently close to falling to $0.550, a crucial technical and psychological support level.\n\nBoth the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) price indicators are heavily bearish at the moment, suggesting that XRP price might see a bounce back from the $0.550 level.\n\nXRP/USD 1-day chart\n\nThe highly anticipated spot BTC ETF approval from the SEC is set to be a major bullish event for the crypto market, expected to drive all crypto assets\u2019 prices up. This could help in XRP price recovery.\n\nHowever, in the worst-case scenario where this is delayed, the Ripple token might see a further decline toward $0.500, invalidating the bullish event."

        "title": "Ripple XRP Weekend Price Prediction - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The onset of 2024 has presented unexpected challenges for Ripple (XRP) as it reached a three-year price low against Bitcoin on Jan. 3. This sudden decline was instigated by a widespread sell-off prompted by speculations surrounding the potential rejection of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The resulting turmoil in the market caught traders by surprise, leading to the disturbance of trading portfolios and the elimination of the previously steady accumulation phase that XRP had been undergoing.\n\nRecent Performance of XRP\n\nOn Jan. 4, XRP showed signs of a modest recovery, recording a gain of 0.88%. This partial reversal followed a 6.68% decline on Jan. 3, culminating in XRP closing the day at $0.5879. The crypto market is on high alert, closely monitoring XRP\u2019s movements in light of the continually evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nXRP Price Projection for January 2024\n\nAnalyzing the price fluctuations of Ripple XRP from the beginning of 2023, crypto experts have formulated a price forecast for January 2024. The anticipated average rate is expected to hover around $0.688. Additionally, the forecasted range of $0.583 as the minimum, and $0.792 as the maximum is also set. However, these projections are made against a backdrop of heightened uncertainty, considering the recent market volatility.\n\nWeekend Price Anticipation\n\nTaking a specific look at the approaching weekend, Changelly, a renowned crypto exchange platform, presents an optimistic outlook for XRP. The altcoin is predicted to undergo a bullish turnaround, surging by 5% on January 6, reaching a peak of $0.619769. This upward trajectory is expected to extend into Jan. 7, with a substantial 21% increase that would propel XRP to a high of $0.714077.\n\nAdditionally, the weekend price prediction comes at a crucial juncture for XRP. The asset has been contending with regulatory challenges, including an ongoing lawsuit by the SEC. The market sentiment impacted by Ripple\u2019s legal battles has contributed to the recent price volatility. This further underscores the importance of maintaining vigilance in the face of regulatory uncertainties.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple (XRP) Bounces Back With 220% Trading Volume Boost\n\nCaution for Investors\n\nInvestors and traders are cautioned to approach XRP with care, given the unpredictable nature of the crypto market. This is particularly true during periods of regulatory ambiguity. The weekend surge projected by Changelly might provide temporary relief. However, sustained stability is likely contingent on regulatory developments and broader market conditions.\n\nAs the altcoin braces for a weekend marked by expected price fluctuations, the cryptocurrency market remains on edge amid regulatory uncertainties. The recent market turbulence emphasizes the need for investors to stay informed and exercise caution. While short-term predictions hint at a bullish turn for XRP, the broader outlook hinges on regulatory developments and the industry\u2019s adaptability to the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple XRP Predicted to Surge 4,720%?"
