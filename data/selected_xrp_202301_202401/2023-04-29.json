        "content": "Recently, popular YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming announced on Twitter that it lost access to its account. Notably, XRP hackers hijacked the channel to promote their scam. The administrators asked for assistance to reclaim ownership of the gaming channel.\n\nBut this is not the first time such incidents have occurred on YouTube. Recall that Ripple sued YouTube in 2020 for not taking the right measures to combat such scams.\n\nDidYouKnowGaming Hijacked To Promote XRP Scam\n\nThe channel shared the latest incident on its Twitter page, stating that the team lost access to its YouTube account. However, the team assured followers it is working to get the channel back but also requested help from experts on such matters.\n\nAccording to users\u2019 reports, the bad actors accessed the channel\u2019s Google account and changed its name from DidYouKnowGaming to Ripple. The hackers also used Ripple\u2019s logo to deceive unsuspecting viewers into falling for their antics.\n\nThe gaming channel had up to 2.4 million subscribers, and this large audience represented a viable ground for scammers. Fortunately, the viewers alerted the team when unfamiliar content flooded their subscription feeds.\n\nAccording to some viewers of the channel, the hackers didn\u2019t delete or delist the original videos on the channel. As such, there\u2019s still hope for the creators to recover the videos after regaining their access.\n\nHowever, a user called out YouTube to restore the channel, while another user condemned the crypto hackers for exploiting channels for scam schemes.\n\nBad Actors Use YouTube Videos To Launch Crypto Scams\n\nThe latest incident targeted YouTube users interested in amassing XRP tokens. The idea was to deceive their target into investing or sending them digital assets in the name of huge returns.\n\nThis sort of incident is recurring in the crypto space. In 2020, scammers also impersonated Ripple executives to promote XRP giveaway scams leading to a lawsuit between Ripple and YouTube.\n\nBut apart from XRP, bad actors have successfully deceived YouTube users with fraudulent apps posing as USDT investment schemes. A February report by WithSecure disclosed that 30 scammers had stolen over $100,000 from at least 900 victims.\n\nThe report noted that the videos were hosted on YouTube and promised the victims huge investment returns. Some of the channels selling the scam had a good number of subscribers and views, and some were YouTube-verified accounts.\n\nFurther, the researchers mentioned discovering 700 URLs linked to the scammer\u2019s apps using analysis techniques and data capture. The #usdtmining hashtag on YouTube also had more than 3900 misleading videos.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay and chart from TradingView"

        "content": "The indicator considers previous price movements from XRP that led to surges of 47,000% and 700%.\n\nXRP may be primed for an explosive rally that could skyrocket its price by 300% to 30,000% in the near future. XRP\u2019s potential to hit this threshold was recently highlighted by Egrag, a prominent crypto analyst, using a key indicator that has proved reliable over the years.\n\nIn his latest analysis, Egrag called attention to a phenomenon observed with the 100 moving average (MA), the 200 moving average, and the 300 moving average in the 2-day time frame.\n\n#XRP The Next Kabooom ?????: Definition of Kabooom :\n\nOnce the 100 MA on 2D Time Frame crosses the 200 MA and consecutively crosses the 300MA. The first Kaboom pumped #XRP around 47,000% from the cross. The second Kaboom pumped #XRP around 700% from the cross. How\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Y4ffyClHIH \u2014 EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 28, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, it was observed that whenever the 100 MA breaks above the 200 MA and subsequently crosses above the 300 MA, XRP has always staged a massive rally that has increased its price by unprecedented scales. Egrag dubbed this phenomenon \u201cKaboom,\u201d seeking to reference explosive growth.\n\nThe phenomenon occurred in late 2017 and ultimately resulted in a 47,000% surge in XRP\u2019s value. The rally spilled into the first few months of 2018, leading to XRP\u2019s all-time high on Jan. 4, 2018. This remains the biggest rally from XRP to date.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe bullish cross was also observed in early 2021 at a time when XRP had plummeted from its 2018 highs and was trading below the $0.3 price territory. Notably, XRP surged from a $0.22 price in January 2021 to a high of $1.96 in April 2021, marking a massive 763% increase in 3 months.\n\nXRP Could Soon Observe the Cross\n\nXRP has only witnessed two such massive surges since its inception, and the cross immediately preceded both surges. Egrag pointed out that the cross is about to happen again, and the asset\u2019s price could skyrocket by 300%, 3,000%, or 30,000% without stating a fixed rate.\n\nInstead, he allowed his audience to predict what they felt could be the most reasonable rate. Some proponents suggested a 30,000% increase if the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit ends with a favorable ruling for XRP. It bears mentioning that XRP\u2019s dramatic 760% surge in April 2021 occurred despite the legal pressure from the SEC lawsuit.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP is trading for $0.4792, up 6.16% in the past week. The asset recently recovered from a low of $0.44 on Wednesday. At a time when XRP consolidated at $0.50, Egrag had opined that dropping to the $0.43 territory is possible. He noted that such a drop would be bullish as XRP would plummet to this point so as not to revisit it."

        "content": "Ripple Energy has recently announced that its first shared solar park will be built in Derril Water, Devon. Ripple Energy, a co-operative ownership pioneer, is offering shares in Derril Water, a 42MW PV project in West Devon, claiming to be Britain\u2019s firs\n\nRipple Energy has recently announced that its first shared solar park will be built in Derril Water, Devon. Ripple Energy, a co-operative ownership pioneer, is offering shares in Derril Water, a 42MW PV project in West Devon, claiming to be Britain\u2019s first consumer-owned solar farm. Shares starting at \u00a325 are available for local investors and UK citizens interested in clean power. The venture has planning permission on low grade fields at Pyworthy, after Ripple bought the Devon project from developers RES. The company sees shared ownership of solar farms as an affordable, straightforward way for households to address climate change and reduce their carbon footprint. Owners of Derril Water will see savings applied to their electricity bill based on how much power their share of the park generates. The power sale contract has a clause that requires suppliers to offer the electricity at a discount back to the farm\u2019s owners with Ripple\u2019s marketing materials quoting around 25% off competitors\u2019 prices. A fund run by the owners\u2019 co-operative will benefit community activities around Derril Water, and power sales should raise about \u00a342,000 every year, adding to \u00a315,000 from developers RES, already committed to refurbish a village hall. The site\u2019s biodiversity will be improved through the planting of species-rich grasses, native trees and 30% more hedgerows plus the installation of bird and bat boxes, hedgehog houses, dormouse boxes and bee banks.\n\nDevon CPRE Director Penny Mills says: \u201cDevon CPRE has long campaigned for \u2018Grass not Glass\u2019 and supported the community of Pyworthy in fighting the Derril Water Solar Park, ultimately taking the legal challenge to the High Court.\n\n\u2018In our view, this announcement makes no difference to the reasons the Devon branch of the countryside charity backed residents in fighting Pyworthy\u2019s Derril Water solar farm. The offer of shared ownership doesn\u2019t alter the loss of precious farmland that could be used to produce food at a time when there\u2019s a greater than ever need to increase the UK\u2019s food security, nor does it alter the loss of local democracy in a community which was overwhelmingly against this development.\n\n\u2018Ripple Energy is promoting its shared ownership scheme as a \u2018benefit\u2019 to the community by \u2018ring-fencing 10% of the shares in Derril Water for local households and businesses to buy\u2019. To our mind, genuine community initiatives are shaped by local communities, not imposed on them.\n\n\u2018Ripple and RES say they will work closely with the local community on this project, but this is the first our charity and, we believe, the people in Pyworthy have heard of this scheme; when the two companies involved decide to jointly announce it to the general public. So much for community involvement!\n\n\u2018Barely a week goes by without one local authority or another in Devon considering a solar farm proposal. Next week a site visit is due to take place on land in East Devon where Aura Power plans to cover 145 acres of farmland at Whimple with solar panels. Devon CPRE has objected to the scheme, which is recommended for approval despite many concerns from the local community. Among numerous objections submitted to East Devon District Council, Devon CPRE states that 94.6% of the proposed site is graded 3a or 3b land, thereby including Best and Most Versatile (BMV) land, which should be protected for food production.\u201d\n\n\u2018Devon CPRE recently released a map showing the alarming spread of industrial-sized solar developments across the county. The map shows the number, scale and spread of 65 permitted and pending solar farms of 20+ acres in Devon, and the only major application to be refused last December (at Marsh Green in East Devon). The nine largest solar farms covering 100+ acres are all within the local authority areas of Torridge, North Devon, Mid Devon and East Devon.\n\n\u2018The publication of Devon CPRE\u2019s solar farm map comes as the national charity CPRE launches its own campaign for solar to be located on rooftops. Thousands of new houses are going up across Devon (and across the country) on greenfield sites, but most of these new homes aren\u2019t being built with a single solar panel on the roof or include any other renewable energy features. We believe that new homes should be built to meet future energy needs.\n\n\u2018Solar power has a part to play in providing so-called renewable energy but, in a wet climate like Devon\u2019s, covering thousands of acres of productive pasture with glass is not the \u2018green\u2019 solution it\u2019s claimed to be; especially when there are plenty of redundant brownfield sites and rooftops where the panels could be put; for example: supermarkets, car parks and council offices.\n\n\u2018At a time of rapidly rising food prices, Devon's farmland should not be covered in solar panels to produce small quantities of expensive electricity at times of the day when it is least needed but should instead be used to produce high-quality food for local consumers.\n\n\u2018We question why RES decided to involve a third party in its plans for Derril Water Solar Park? A sceptic might say it\u2019s because they have so far failed to win over the majority of local residents to their scheme.\u201d"
