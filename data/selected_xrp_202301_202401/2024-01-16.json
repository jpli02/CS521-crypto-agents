And I think he's not acting in the interests of the citizenry, he's not acting in the interests of the long-term growth of the economy, and I don't understand it,\" Garlinghouse told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal onstage during a fireside chat at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"I think at some point there will be a new chair of the SEC, and I think that will be a good thing for the American people.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nThe SEC did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.\n\nSEC's campaign against crypto\n\nLast week, the SEC approved a spate of spot bitcoin ETFs, paving the way for the products to begin trading. But Gensler has repeatedly expressed concerns about the risks of approving bitcoin ETFs, stating that cryptocurrencies trade on unregulated markets and are vulnerable to price manipulation. A day before the bitcoin ETFs were approved last week, the X, formerly Twitter, account of the SEC posted a statement saying it had greenlit such a financial instrument. This later proved to be a false announcement, as the SEC disclosed its account had been compromised by hackers. The ETFs were approved after the SEC was defeated in court over a lawsuit that sought to quash the bitcoin ETF application of digital asset manager Grayscale."
