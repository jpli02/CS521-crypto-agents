        "content": "An attractive addition to the city\u2019s Downtown riverfront was unveiled in April. The new Sunrise Pump Station, a $60 million portion of the Evansville Water and Sewer Utility\u2019s $729 million Renew Evansville project, was designed for treated water to return to the Ohio River, but with a little flair.\n\nThe new station will help prevent stagnant water and sewage from building up in the concrete ditch alongside the Veterans Memorial Parkway. New pipes move treated water from the East Wastewater Treatment Plant to Sunrise Pump Station, where the final cleaned effluent is pumped over the levee to the top of the cascade and into the Ohio River.\n\nWhen discussing the project at community input sessions back in 2017, residents pondered how to let the station perform its function while beautifying the riverfront. Thus, the approximately 11-to-12-acre space was constructed with people in mind, with outdoor and indoor relaxation spaces.\n\nSwinging chairs and an observation deck circle a waterfall cascade where treated water exits the station, offering an unobstructed view of the northern riverfront esplanade. The entrance includes space for seating and the potential for a spray park on a hot summer day. A rooftop lookout gives an enhanced, birds-eye view of the area and the Downtown Evansville riverfront.\n\nInside, viewers can witness the water testing process and the pipes delivering water from the treatment plant and through the station. Lane Young, the utility\u2019s executive director, hopes the space can host events for education and the community.\n\n\u201cThis public space on the riverfront will draw people in, and once inside people will be able to see our lab at work,\u201d Young says. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to open up.\u201d\n\nA Cleaner Future\n\newsu.com"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a new tweet, Ripple partner Tranglo says it has revitalized volume in key corridors, processing over $1 billion in ODL transactions since the launch of ODL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March 2022, Tranglo enabled Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service for all its payment corridors after the success of its pilot ODL deployment in September 2021, which saw 250,000 transactions worth $48 million processed within the initial 100 days.\n\nTranglo has revitalised volume in key corridors, processing over USD1 billion in ODL transactions after the partnership with @Ripple in 2021. Find out how and why partnership can minimise cross-border payment challenges.https://t.co/TMia9wgsiN \u2014 Tranglo (@Tranglo) May 12, 2023\n\nRipple acquired 40% of Asia's leading cross-border payments provider, Tranglo, in 2021. This partnership was meant to allow Ripple to meet growing customer demand in the Asian region and expand the reach of ODL, which utilizes the digital asset XRP.\n\nTranglo boasts of its partnership with Ripple, saying it now offers improved cross-border payout services with even broader coverage through RippleNet, Ripple's global payment network. Notably, Ripple has also broadened its ODL footprint as a result of the partnership.\n\nAnother development regarding the growth of ODL is that Bitso, a major cryptocurrency exchange in Latin America and also a Ripple partner, reported last quarter that through institutional crypto solutions like the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, it exceeded $3.3 billion in transactions between the U.S. and Mexico in 2022.\n\nLast quarter, total XRP sales by Ripple recorded significant growth, reaching $361.06 million. Ripple has continued to sell XRP only in connection with ODL transactions."

        "content": "Ripple opens Dubai office, relocates Swell Global 2023\n\nRipple, a prominent supplier of blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions for businesses, is set to expand its presence in Dubai following robust growth in the MENA region.\n\nThe US-based company is poised to establish a new office located in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a key financial hub, while also relocating its annual customer conference, Swell Global 2023, from London to Dubai on November 8-9.\n\nAs Ripple conducts the majority of its business beyond the US, the MENA region holds significant importance for its global operations. Specifically, almost 20% of all RippleNet clients are based in the Middle East, having onboarded big names such as SABB, Lulu Financial Holdings, RAK Bank, Qatar National Bank, and Al-Ansari Exchange. Additionally, the cross-border payments, including remittances from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the UAE to India, make up over half of Ripple\u2019s payment volume in the MENA region.\n\n\u201cWe chose Dubai as both a key office for Ripple, and to bring Swell Global to the city, in large part due to its forward-thinking regulatory environment. Regulators here have risen to the challenge of establishing a framework that allows the local crypto industry to thrive, create jobs and increase economic growth, while also ensuring participants act in a responsible manner, \u201d said Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO.\n\nThe San Francisco-based blockchain payments company has been pushing ahead to bring faster and cheaper cross-border payments using XRP in the Middle East.\n\nThrough On-Demand Liquidity, RippleNet utilizes XRP as a bridge between two currencies, thus lowering operational costs, unlocking capital, and enables the users to avoid pre-funding accounts on each side of a transaction.\n\nDubai\u2019s progressive regulatory policies were commended by Ripple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, who made public Ripple\u2019s first-ever deployment of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) in the Middle East. The move was announced in partnership with Pyypl, a financial services technology firm leveraging blockchain-based solutions in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe move comes as Ripple continues to consider alternative locations for its business amid ongoing regulatory woes in the US over its cryptocurrency.\n\nRipple\u2019s CEO said last year that the company is considering a move away from its home base in San Francisco amid regulatory quagmire around its XRP token. However, there is no indication yet from the $10 billion fintech company that such a move is going ahead soon.\n\n\u201cEssentially, our customers and its revenue are all driven outside of the U.S., even though we still have a lot of employees inside of the U.S.,\u201d he added.\n\nRipple is yet to decide where to pick up its new mother base, but the firm has already set up regional headquarters in Dubai.\n\nGarlinghouse expects that the court case between Ripple and SEC could last another three to four months and would end in the first half of 2023. He also revealed that Ripple would consider a settlement if the SEC agrees that XRP is not a security."

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Eastern State Penitentiary is not only a site for tours (and haunted activations come the fall), but since 1995, the historic site has commissioned more than 100 site-specific artist installations on its grounds. And the latest pop-up to add to their list recently opened at the venue last weekend.\n\nAs a release states, projects are selected through an annual application process, which seeks memorable, thought-provoking additions to the historic site\u2019s public programming, combined with \u201ctrue excellence in artistic practice.\u201d Installations are ultimately chosen by how they can draw a line from incarceration to today\u2019s world, all while showcasing the complicated history of the space.\n\nThe ESP is now housing work from mixed-media artist E.D. Taylor. This site-specific installation features a series of dioramas and artifacts to showcase the artist\u2019s reflection on a childhood visit with her Uncle Andy that took place following his confinement to California\u2019s Atascadero State Hospital as a \u201cMentally Disordered Sex Offender.\u201d\n\nTitled Visiting Uncle Andy at Atascadero State Hospital (a maximum-security forensic facility), 1981, or simply Visiting Uncle Andy, the new exhibit opened at the Eastern State Penitentiary on May 5, and will remain on display until the end of this year.\n\nThe official description puts it best on what to expect: On June 20, 1980, Andy, a seventh-grade teacher, was involuntarily committed to Atascadero State Hospital, an all-male psychiatric institution in California. He served seven years there for sexually assaulting at least two pre-pubescent boys who attended the K-12 school where he worked. The artist and her family visited Andy at Atascadero first in 1981 and again in 1983. Andy\u2019s name has been changed to protect the identities of all parties involved.\n\nWhat E.D. Taylor showcases through her work are her memories (along with her families) peppered in with facts obtained from court documents regarding the case. To view this installation, visitors will go into a cell block and look through three peepholes to see dioramas depicting the artist\u2019s memories of trips to Atascadero State Hospital to visit her uncle during his incarceration there.\n\n\u201cThis installation is about where my uncle\u2019s life intersects with mine. It\u2019s about how events reverberate through time,\u201d says E.D. Taylor in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s also about the tension between what we remember and what really happened. It\u2019s about the way crime impacts victims, perpetrators, and family members. And, finally, it\u2019s about forgiveness.\u201d\n\nIn the exhibit, there will also be two display cases on both sides of the cell that hold various artifacts relating to Uncle Andy\u2019s life, arrest, and conviction. Items include yearbook photos, redacted court records, and Taylor\u2019s musings about her uncle\u2019s ultimate downfall.\n\n\u201cWe are honored that E.D. considered Eastern State Penitentiary a fitting backdrop for such a deeply personal, but also universally thought-provoking installation,\u201d says Sean Kelley, Eastern State Penitentiary\u2019s senior vice president, in a statement.\n\nKelley continued: \u201cAt Eastern State, we invite all our visitors to consider the ways their lives intersect with the criminal justice system. This story presents another avenue to consider the ripple effects of crime. We look forward to the difficult but important conversations this piece will encourage here at Eastern State.\u201d\n\nVisiting Uncle Andy can be viewed (and is included with admission) during the ESP\u2019s daytime tours, as well as the Night Tours: Summer Twilight, and will remain on view through the end of 2023.\n\nAnother experience currently open at the Penitentiary includes The Voices of Eastern State Audio Tour, the organization\u2019s signature program. The audio tour, which is narrated by actor Steve Buscemi features the voices of former prisoners and correctional staff, and it guides visitors through the penitentiary complex, including popular points of interest such as Al Capone\u2019s cell, death row, and the award-winning exhibit: Prisons Today: Questions in the Age of Mass Incarceration. The guide-led Hands-On History tours, and history exhibits, are also included with admission.\n\nTickets are available online or at the door, subject to availability.

        "title": "Monterey Bay farmers are struggling to rebound from winter storms. The ripple effect is huge - 90.3 KAZU",
        "content": "In a muddy field in Watsonville, farmer Peter Navarro showed off rows of strawberry plants that are starting to bear fruit and look healthy. The trouble, he said, is that this is what these plants should have looked like in March \u2014 not the beginning of May.\n\n\u201cIt's a good month, maybe five weeks, even up to six weeks behind,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nThis year\u2019s historic winter storms and floods, followed by unusually cold weather, set back crops throughout the region.\n\n\u201cI think everyone realizes at this point that the spring crop is probably not going to happen,\u201d said Norm Groot, executive director of the Monterey County Farm Bureau . \u201cIt's probably going to be a summer crop for most of those fields.\u201d\n\nScott Cohn / KAZU News Growers say the important strawberry crop in the Pajaro and Salinas River valleys is as much as six weeks behind schedule.\n\nIn an area that relies on steady income from agriculture, the effects of the delay ripple from farmers to farm workers, and into the broader economy. Officials are still tallying the damage from the last wave of winter storms in March, but Groot said that in Monterey County alone, roughly 10% of acreage was affected.\n\nScott Cohn / KAZU News Watsonville berry farmer Peter Navarro normally employs roughly 300 people. But he says there is little work for them until his strawberries are ready to harvest.\n\n\u201cIt's not a total impact,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is a pretty significant impact, particularly to strawberries.\u201d\n\nNavarro said his crop had started to rebound in April as things dried out. But May's unseasonable rain hit just as some berries were finally ready for harvest. On Navarro\u2019s farm are piles of big, juicy strawberries \u2014 the kind Watsonville is famous for \u2014 that he cannot sell because of the surface damage the May rains caused.\n\n\u201cWe have to walk through the field, and any ripe fruit is basically not going to make it to market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just go in and clean our fields, so we basically just dump the fruit.\u201d\n\nBut beyond that, there is little to do for the roughly 300 people he normally employs. In a normal season, his fields would be full of ripe strawberries, and full of workers harvesting them.\n\n\u201cWe'd be going at a decent pace right now,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to the loss of work for his employees, Navarro is not collecting the revenue he normally would during the spring harvest. That affects his business decisions well beyond this season.\n\n\u201cWe still have this year's investment that we have not recouped a penny on. And you have to think about the following year,\u201d he said. \"It really makes you nervous.\u201d\n\nFederal disaster assistance is available for farmers, but most of it is geared toward operations that lost acreage due to flooding. For them, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will cover up to 75% of the cost of land restoration, up to $500,000.\n\nBut for farmers who did not lose cropland, like Navarro, the main assistance vehicle is low-interest loans, currently at an interest rate of 3.75%. He worries about taking on more debt when there is no money coming in.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re taking a loan to pay a loan, it's kind of spinning your wheels,\u201d he said.\n\nHe could plant fewer acres in the fall to save on input costs, but that means less revenue next spring. Or he could plant more in the fall to try and make up for this year\u2019s shortfall, but that could be risky with forecasters calling for a potentially wet El Ni\u00f1o winter.\n\n\u201cAll of this makes you really sit down and think how you're going to move forward,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issues also have an impact beyond this region.\n\nCalifornia produces 90% of the nation\u2019s strawberry supply. Normally, strawberry season rolls through the state like a wave. As it peaks in southern growing areas like Ventura, growers in the north pick it up. This year, the normal pattern is off, with roughly 5% of California\u2019s strawberry acreage destroyed in the March storms, according to the California Strawberry Commission .\n\nAs a result, the industry is trying to regroup.\n\nScott Cohn / KAZU News Strawberry fields like this one near the Pajaro River are starting to rebound from this winter\u2019s storms and floods, but unseasonable rain and cold temperatures in early May left mud and standing water.\n\n\u201cFor some growers, it's honestly just a matter of time,\u201d said commission spokesman Jeff Cardinale. \u201cBut in the industry, time is usually not on your side.\u201d\n\nFortunately, he said, roughly 95% of the state's strawberry acreage remains viable, which means supplies \u2014 and prices \u2014 are stable at a key point in the season.\n\n\u201cThe way that the industry is set up here in California is there will always be California strawberries available,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's just a matter of the amount.\u201d\n\nFarmers like Peter Navarro pride themselves on being eternal optimists. But he admits this year is putting that optimism to the test.\n\n"
