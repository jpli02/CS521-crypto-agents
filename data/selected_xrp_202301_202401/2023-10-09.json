        "content": "XRP (XRP), the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, experienced a noteworthy surge in price earlier this month, buoyed by a double dose of positive developments.\n\nIn particular, federal judge Analisa Torres\u2019 rejection of the SEC\u2019s appeal reinforced her earlier ruling that Ripple\u2019s sale of XRP didn\u2019t violate securities laws. Adding to the optimism, Ripple recently secured a full operational license in Singapore.\n\nAlthough XRP has since retreated to the $0.50 mark, fresh positivity is again on the horizon.\n\nNotably, it appears that cryptocurrency is emerging as a favored choice for cross-border payments and settlements in Mexico, potentially rekindling investor enthusiasm.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAccording to a document on Banco de M\u00e9xico\u2019s official website, the central bank is planning to utilize one of Ripple\u2019s liquidity solutions, a pivotal bridge between the US dollar (USD) and the Mexican peso (MXN).\n\nSpecifically, the document mentions xRapid \u2013 a Ripple product that uses XRP as a \u201cbridge asset\u201d that businesses and financial institutions can leverage as a bridge transfer between two different fiat currencies.\n\nIn this case, Mexico\u2019s central bank is looking to utilize xRapid as a bridge mechanism between the USD and MXN.\n\n\u201cxRapid payments are fully settled in two minutes or less and reduce costs by 40-70%. This near-instant settlement is in contrast to cross-border payments in the traditional system that take three-to-five days to settle.\u201d \u2013 Banco de M\u00e9xico wrote in the document.\n\nWhat does this mean for XRP?\n\nNaturally, Banco de M\u00e9xico\u2019s adoption of xRapid and its plan to use XRP as a bridge asset represents a major milestone for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFor years, Ripple has been aggressively promoting the scalability, speed, and low cost of XRP to global financial institutions. With Mexico\u2019s central bank joining, XRP continues to prove its appeal as an asset with multiple use cases, beyond just cross-border transactions.\n\nAs more banks and financial institutions recognize XRP\u2019s potential, the crypto token is a step closer to mainstream adoption.\n\nIf such developments continue without significant regulatory hurdles, the growing adoption of XRP means heightened institutional interest, potentially exerting substantial influence on the price of the token.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "XRP price slipped nearly 5% on Monday, losing a crucial support line with price indicators nearing a bearish divergence.\n\nAmid SEC\u2019s ongoing tiff with Ripple, Chief Financial Officer Kristina Campbell resigned this week.\n\nThe altcoin, however, is finding more demand in the derivatives market, with Deribit set to launch XRP options trading.\n\nXRP price on Monday might have corrected some of the gains it noted in the past few days, but Ripple developers are finding success with their AMM (Automated Market Maker) experiment.\n\nRipple CFO resigns\n\nRipple recently made some progress for good as it not only partially won the lawsuit the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed against the company but also won the ruling from Judge Torres, who denied the regulator\u2019s appeal of the initial decision. However, amidst the streak of good news, Ripple witnessed the resignation of its Chief Financial Officer, Kristina Campbell.\n\nCampbell was a part of the company for over two and a half years and was present throughout the SEC lawsuit. The former Ripple executive called it quits this month to join Maven Clinic as its CFO. However, by the looks of it, the exit seemed amicable as Campbell took to LinkedIn to announce her departure, saying,\n\n\u201cA big thank you to everyone at Ripple who made the last few years so memorable.\u201d\n\nRipple developers to bring AMM on Ledger\n\nRipple developers, through the RippleX account on X, formerly Twitter, announced that they completed the extensive testing of the XLS-30 AMM. This is a proposed amendment that, if adopted, would bring automated swap, trading, and liquidity provisioning capabilities to XRP Ledger (XRPL).\n\nBack in July, audit firm CertiK completed the audit of XLS-30 with a successful result of no major issues, however, 35 minor issues did come up, which have since been resolved. AMMs are the underlying protocol that power decentralized exchanges (DEX) that have been in demand by Ripple users for a long time now.\n\n4/ To complement a secure codebase, the RippleX team has conducted ongoing performance testing of the core XRP Ledger for over a year. A rigorous methodology has been employed to assess the ledger\u2019s and consensus\u2019s performance and latency to ensure the health of XRPL MainNet. \u2014 RippleX (@RippleXDev) October 6, 2023\n\nXRP price takes a dip\n\nXRP price, trading at $0.501 at the time of writing, registered its biggest single-day drop in the past month. Falling by more than 5.8% during the intra-day trading hours, the altcoin lost the support of the $0.50 mark before recovering slightly, trading at a discount of 3%. The cryptocurrency, however, is still below its month-long uptrend line, as well as the previously tested support floor of $0.505.\n\nXRP/USD 1-day chart\n\nThe price indicators are also suggesting a potential bearish momentum building up, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) slipping below the neutral line at 50.0. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which measures the change in momentum, is also inching closer to a potential bearish divergence. If the MACD line (blue) crosses below the signal line (red), XRP could see further decline.\n\nXRP price indicators\n\nThis could result in XRP price falling to the September low of $0.47, and losing this level would lead to the altcoin dipping to a three-month low.\n\nHowever, if broader market positive sentiment pushes the altcoin back up, XRP price could manage to maintain $0.505 as a support level. This is crucial in restarting the recovery rally to flip the uptrend line into support from resistance in order to invalidate the bearish thesis and breach $0.54.\n\nRead more - XRP rally likely as Bank of International Settlement adds Ripple to its interoperability task force"

        "title": "How Ripple Effect is transforming Africa - BORGEN - Borgen Project",
        "content": "BATH, United Kingdom \u2014 Ripple Effect is a charity that works with farmers in Africa to help them grow enough food to eat and sell, using sustainable and organic methods. Their mission is to \u201ccreate a world where every person has the opportunity to live a healthy, productive and fulfilling life.\u201d\n\nBy providing local livestock, seeds and practical training in sustainable farming and business skills and supporting farmers\u2019 access to education, health care and markets, they encourage farmers to pass on their knowledge and gifts to their friends and neighbors. This provision creates a ripple effect of positive change that helps the whole community.\n\nRipple Effect was formerly known as Send a Cow and was founded in 1988 by Devon dairy farmers who sent cows to Uganda. Today, they work in African countries with experienced and committed African staff and have fundraising and resource support from the UK and the U.S. This article explores how these charities work diligently to reduce poverty in Africa through innovative approaches and sustainable solutions. The name Ripple Effect highlights their work as their influence propagates through Africa to create a better life.\n\nIssues African Farmers Face\n\nRipple Effect works in Ethiopia, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia. Ripple Effect is transforming Africa with important work. For instance, the World Bank characterizes Burundi\u2019s economy as low-income, with approximately 80% of its population engaged in the agricultural sector, including 2.3 million who are severely food insecure. Ripple Effect has been utilizing its projects and programs in Burundi since 2013. It currently manages two projects in Mwaro and Bujumbura Rural, both focusing on improving nutrition and enhancing resilience in the face of climate challenges. Similarly, Ripple Effect\u2019s projects within Ethiopia have helped approximately 142,796 people in eight projects. This astonishing work is vital in transforming Africa, as approximately 30 million Ethiopians live below the poverty line.\n\nTransformative Household Methodology (THM)\n\nThe Borgen Project spoke to Ripple Effect, and they disclosed that their most innovative method for transforming Africa is their Transformative Household Methodology (THM). THM is a tool designed to raise awareness of gender dynamics within households, encompassing the interactions between all household members to minimize the effects of poverty on everyone, especially women. USAID has provided funding for developing a training manual to enhance the efficacy of this essential cornerstone program.\n\nAlthough women play crucial roles within households and communities, their contributions often go unnoticed by society. Additionally, women have limited access to their household\u2019s resources and finances and are rarely involved in decision-making.\n\nCreated by the Gender & Social Inclusion Coordinator in Ethiopia, Ripple Effect transforms Africa by utilizing training sessions to guarantee active participation in discussions. In this method, family members create a grid on the ground using wooden sticks, with each box representing either a household activity (such as fetching water or cooking) or a resource (like food, livestock or cash).\n\nFamily members are listed along one axis, and the various household chores and resources are listed along the other. Each family member is encouraged to place stones or beans within the grid, indicating their level of involvement in specific activities or their control over resources. Afterward, the family members tally the number of stones or beans placed in each activity/resource symbol and associate the results with the gender of the individuals involved. This process heightens awareness of disparities in workload and resource control within the family. Subsequently, they engage in a collective discussion and make decisions regarding actions to rectify imbalances in roles, workloads and resource access.\n\nThis type of gender transformation has spread to other NGOs. Ripple Effect was instrumental in developing this process in their Ethiopia country program. They are one of very few organizations that do this work at a family/household level rather than a community level. They have learned it creates lasting and transformational change for women in poverty.\n\nRipple Effect is Transforming Africa\n\nAll Ripple Effect programs in sustainable agriculture and enterprise training start with their gender work to address these fundamental family relationships. Otherwise, their work will not be effective.\n\nTHM is pivotal in their program because it can encapsulate the unique family dynamics of each household. The THM tool has the remarkable capacity to cater to nuanced differences and offer context-specific tailored solutions.\n\nWhat makes THM even more remarkable is its inclusivity. It opens its doors to every member of the household, ensuring participation from boys, girls, adults, individuals with disabilities and young mothers. This inclusivity is a foundation of its gender transformation approach, fostering engagement and contributions from all age groups within the household.\n\nA fundamental aspect of THM\u2019s focus is on gender dynamics at the household level, particularly regarding access to and control over resources. The allocation of resources within households often reveals a gendered pattern, and THM delves into this issue by differentiating between access and control. Access refers to the opportunity to utilize a resource, while control is the power to decide how to use it and who has access to it. It is not uncommon for women to have access to resources but limited control over them, highlighting an important aspect of gender disparities.\n\nBy recognizing the importance of both access and control over resources, THM empowers households to confront and address gender inequalities effectively, making it a vital tool in Ripple Effect\u2019s program\u2019s mission to promote gender equality and empower all members of the household to reduce the laborious effects of poverty.\n\n\u2013 April Plenderleith\n\nPhoto: Flickr"
