        "content": "Ripple Launches New Settlements Platform, Announces New Partnership with African Fintech Firm\n\nDuring Ripple's annual conference Swell, held in Dubai, the company announced partnerships and initiatives aimed at broadening its cross-border payments solutions.\n\nIn collaboration with African payments fintech Onafriq, Ripple is expanding remittance capabilities in Africa and establishing blockchain-based payments corridors.\n\nThese corridors will connect Onafriq users in Africa with customers of PayAngel in the U.K., Pyypl in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and Zazi Transfer in Australia.\n\nMonica Long, president at Ripple, said:\n\n\u201cWe are excited about this because it also contributes to Ripple payments being able to cover 90% of FX markets.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Ripple is targeting corporate clients without their own money transmitter licenses with its updated settlements platform, Ripple Payments.\n\nThe platform aims to simplify cross-border crypto payments for corporate clients in the U.S., attracting those without the licenses or extensive knowledge of crypto. Ripple's acquisition of multiple money transmitter licenses, including 30 in the U.S., has enabled the rollout of this new payments solution.\n\nThe XRP token, native to the Ripple blockchain, has made headlines recently following its victory over the SEC. Further, XRP received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority.\n\nXRP has gained 100.4% so far this year, and is currently trading at $0.6799, according to CoinMarketCap data."

        "content": "HSBC Partners with Ripple-Owned Metaco for Tokenized Securities Custody Platform\n\nHSBC, a major global banking institution, has partnered with Metaco, a Ripple-owned technology startup, to build an institutional custody platform for tokenized assets.\n\nHSBC, which has $5.6 trillion in custody, plans to debut this new service in 2024, alongside its existing digital asset issuance platform, HSBC Orion, and a recently launched gold tokenization solution.\n\nAccording to HSBC's Chief Digital, Data, and Innovation Officer Zhu Kuang Lee, said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing increasing demand for custody and fund administration of digital assets from asset managers and asset owners, as this market continues to evolve.\u201d\n\nTokenized securities, which are frequently constructed on blockchain technology, allow for the digital representation of physical assets such as stocks, ETFs, or bonds. They can also be used to securitize other assets, including real estate, and to raise funds by selling fractionalized ownership via digital tokens rather than traditional stock issues.\n\nThe relationship between HSBC and Metaco, which was acquired by Ripple in May for $250 million, focuses on Metaco's Harmonize, an institutional platform that ensures secure and uniform digital asset operations. This partnership is part of HSBC's larger investigation into distributed ledger technology (DLT) applications in asset generation and custody.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."
