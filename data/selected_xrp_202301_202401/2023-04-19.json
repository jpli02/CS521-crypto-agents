        "title": "Here\u2019s Why You Should Invest in Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP) and DigiToads (TOADS) for Long-Term Returns - CoinChapter",
        "content": "Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) are some of the biggest and most established cryptocurrencies that elicit strong interest in the burgeoning sector. However, while the projects have made their name around cryptocurrency transactions, the sector is increasingly evolving. DigiToads (TOADS) is a new and innovative project that could outperform the two as it moves to impact multiple facets of life.\n\nDigiToads Full Utility Meme Coin\n\nDigiToads has set out to become the number one meme coin backed by utility around play to earn NFT staking and trading competitions. Its primary goal is to offer a way for people to earn while investing in digital assets and benefit from significant price appreciation of its deflationary token TOADS.\n\nConsequently, it has unveiled a thrilling Web 3 game whereby players only have to collect and nurture DigiToads, which boast unique characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. The ultimate goal is to make the DigiToads the strongest within a swamp arena by purchasing food and training equipment. The item will help increase the size and learning abilities of the DigiToads, enhancing their competitive edge.\n\nAt the end of every season, players with the biggest and strongest DigiToads in the swamp arena will walk away with TOADS token rewards. The rewards are to come from the 50% of funds raised from the sale of game items.\n\nThere will also be trading competitions that people can participate in for a chance to walk away with prizes in Platinum Toads. The trading competitions are designed to enhance trading volume within the ecosystem. DigiToads has also affirmed its commitment to supporting the environment by setting aside 2.5% of all profits generated in the ecosystem to support the replanting of trees and preservation of the rainforest.\n\nDigiToads has also enhanced the prospects of making money on the network, setting aside 2% of every TOADS transaction to its NFT staking platform. The amount will be used to payout people who stake their non-fungible tokens.\n\nTOADS is the deflationary token that powers the DigiToads ecosystem acting as a medium of exchange.\n\nIts total supply is capped at 585 million with a token-burning mechanism in place that will seek to reduce the total supply over time.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nCardano is heading to $1\n\nCardano\u2019s impressive start to 2023 shows no signs of slowing down, with the cryptocurrency up by more than 90%-year to date. The stellar performance is already eliciting suggestions that the cryptocurrency could power through the $1 a coin level, given the strong upward momentum.\n\nOne of the factors likely to fuel the upward momentum is Cardano growing prospects around Decentralized Finance. The total value of locked coins in the DeFi ecosystem is already up by more than 80%.\n\nIn addition, Cardano continues to attract developers as an important platform for developing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Talk of the project unveiling its own stablecoin should also affirm the upward momentum.\n\nRipple Easing Woes\n\nRipple (XRP) is another coin that has bounced back after capitulating in 2022 at the height of the crypto winter. Regulatory woes involving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of illegal sale of XRP tokens as securities also hurt the token sentiments in the market.\n\nFast forward, the overall cryptocurrency sector has bounced back, and the SEC stalemate has subsided. Likewise, Ripple is eliciting strong interest as a cross-border payment specialist. It remains the preferred crypto project for sending and receiving international payments.\n\nRipple has also made impressive strides in expanding its global payment network with partnerships across various industries and sectors.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDigiToads is a project well poised to generate significant long-term value owing to its utility around NFT staking P2E and trading competition. The project is already eliciting strong interest in presale, affirming strong interest. With Cardano and Ripple trading at high valuations DigiToads offers an exciting way of gaining exposure in these Ector at discounted levels.\n\nFor More Information on DigiToads visit the website, join the presale or join the community for regular updates."

        "title": "Can't afford solar panels but still want green energy? Buy part of a solar or wind farm - Euronews",
        "content": "Co-owning a wind farm or solar park could reduce your energy bills by 23 per cent and it's totally affordable. Here's how.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhether you\u2019re conscious about your carbon emissions or just want to reduce your energy bills, moving away from traditional gas and oil is an increasingly attractive prospect.\n\nUnless you can afford to install a solar panel, choosing an energy supplier with an environmental pledge appears to be the only option for greener energy.\n\nThat was until Sarah Merrick from Ripple Energy started helping people to co-own a wind turbine.\n\n\u201cI could see that wind had become the UK's cheapest source of electricity but there wasn't really any way for anyone to get involved,\u201d she tells Euronews Green.\n\n\u201cBig projects are cheaper than small projects so that's why buying a little bit of a wind farm is over two thirds cheaper than buying the equivalent rooftop solar scheme.\u201d\n\nFollowing the success of its first consumer-owned wind turbine project, Ripple Energy is now branching out with a 'shared' solar park.\n\nIs it expensive to co-own a wind turbine or solar park?\n\nFirst of all you need to decide how much of your electricity bill you want to be covered by renewable energy.\n\nTo cover the entire electrical consumption of the average three-bedroom home in the UK, it costs around \u00a31,700 (\u20ac1,937) through wind power or \u00a33,000 (\u20ac3,405) through solar. However you can choose to buy just a percentage of your usage with shares of a wind farm or solar park starting from \u00a325 (\u20ac28).\n\nThis is a one-off payment, which can be spread over 12 months, and you\u2019ll own your share for the entirety of the turbine\u2019s 25 year or the solar park's 40 year life span.\n\nEach time Ripple opens a new project, people opt in with their chosen investment until it is fully funded. With all the co-owners secured, Ripple then builds the turbine or solar park and after a short wait, the members are able to start using their green energy to save money on their monthly bills.\n\nRipple are building renewable energy parks across the UK\n\nRipple\u2019s first project was one single wind turbine in Wales. Though it might not sound like much, one rotation of the turbine\u2019s blades creates enough energy to power a home for eight hours, and 900 people were able to sign up to co-ownership.\n\nTheir second project, based in Scotland, is fully funded and under construction. This time it\u2019s a much bigger project with eight turbines, 5,600 co-owners and 19 business members.\n\nThe latest project, which is still open for investment, is Ripple's first solar park. The buy-in cost is slightly higher than that of the wind farms but you'll be benefitting from the energy discounts for 40 years rather than 25.\n\nThough the first two projects were in Wales and Scotland, you don\u2019t need to live nearby to become a member and benefit from its clean energy.\n\nPlus, because unlike a solar panel, you\u2019re not attaching anything to your home, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a renter or want to move house. Your green energy can move with you, just like a normal energy supplier.\n\nTen per cent of the new Derril Water Solar Park - located outside the village of Pyworthy, Devon - has been reserved for households and businesses in the surrounding area. The remaining 90 per cent of shares are available to people across the UK. The park is expected to generate enough energy to power up to 14,000 homes a year.\n\nOnly a fraction of the park will be taken up by the solar infrastructure, allowing agriculture in the form of sheep grazing to continue on 94 per cent of the land during operation.\n\nIs co-owned green energy really cheaper than fossil fuels?\n\nThose who opt into Ripple's schemes do not get free energy, but instead receive credit on their account each month, when supplied by one of Ripple's partner energy suppliers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRipple estimates your bill will be around 23 per cent cheaper overall. And with traditional energy costs increasing exponentially, this saving is becoming even greater.\n\n\u201cIn terms of getting your initial investment back through your savings, it completely depends on the electricity price,\u201d Sarah explains.\n\n\u201cWhen we launched our first wind farm, we were expecting it to take 13 or 14 years [to get your investment back] but since we launched the prices have gone so high [that] it's actually looking like the costs could be paid back through savings in maybe four years instead.\u201d\n\nWatch the video above to learn more about co-owning a green energy park."

        "title": "Big Eyes And Stellar Challenge Ripple As Sec Judgment Approaches - Tekedia",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to experience a bullish trend, it is essential for investors to stay up-to-date on the latest market developments. Specifically, investors should be keeping a close eye on the ongoing legal dispute between Ripple (XRP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The outcome of this lawsuit could have significant implications not only for XRP\u2019s price but also for the prices of its peers, such as Stellar (XLM), and emerging coins like Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nInvestors who analyze the current market climate and the performances of these digital assets will be better equipped to determine which assets may potentially provide a more lucrative return on investment over the long run. Additionally, paying attention to these developments could be a strategic move for investors looking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market. As such, staying informed on the legal proceedings of Ripple and the SEC is crucial for any serious crypto investor.\n\nRipple\u2019s Future Awaits SEC Case Verdict\n\nRipple is a blockchain-based payment processing company that created XRP as a digital asset primarily designed for cross-border payments and settlement. XRP\u2019s usefulness is due to the Ripple ledger technology, which enables it to be transferred across borders within seconds, bypassing intermediaries and reducing costs associated with traditional payment methods that take longer to process.\n\nDespite the ongoing SEC lawsuit, XRP\u2019s value proposition remains largely intact and is still highly regarded in the market. Analysts predict that its price could soar to as high as $3.00 by the end of 2023. However, other cryptocurrencies are emerging with similar services, so competition is growing.\n\nCould Stellar Surpass Ripple As The Leading Cross-Border Payment Option In The Market?\n\nStellar (XLM) is a blockchain platform that has revolutionized global asset and fund transfers by providing a decentralized, fast, secure, and cost-effective solution that offers an excellent alternative to traditional payment methods. Stellar\u2019s distinctive feature lies in its capacity to deliver financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations across the world, which enables individuals and businesses to make quick, low-cost asset and fund transfers across borders.\n\nDespite competition from other digital currencies such as XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, Stellar has managed to establish a robust market presence. This can be attributed to its user-friendly interface, lower transaction costs, and lightning-fast transaction times. With market predictions pointing towards an increase in value, Stellar has become an attractive investment opportunity for crypto investors seeking to maximize their returns on investment. As per market projections, the value of Stellar is expected to reach up to $0.75 by the end of 2023, making it an excellent investment option in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhat Is The Approach Of Big Eyes In Competing With XRP And XLM?\n\nBig Eyes Coin is a novel cryptocurrency that has recently emerged and is currently in the presale phase. Its main objective is to offer users various benefits, including fast processing, a secure network, and low transaction fees. Furthermore, the coin is scalable, allowing it to handle high volumes of transactions.\n\nAside from its technical advantages, Big Eyes Coin has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for inexperienced investors to use it. The project\u2019s overarching goal is to create a complete ecosystem that generates wealth for its investors by transitioning wealth from traditional financial systems to DeFi.\n\nImportant Considerations\n\nXRP and Big Eyes Coin are two significant players in the cryptocurrency market, each having its own set of advantages and drawbacks. While XRP is facing regulatory hurdles, it is still a preferred choice for financial institutions due to its speed and efficiency in cross-border transactions.\n\nOn the other hand, Big Eyes Coin is a recent addition to the market that boasts of a low transaction fee and a user-friendly interface, making it an attractive investment opportunity for early adopters. The project also offers promo codes that promise substantial returns for investors, such as the latest code END300 which guarantees a 300% increase in BIG tokens. All in all, Big Eyes Coin appears to be a promising crypto project with the potential to provide substantial returns on investment.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "PRISM+ Ripple Soundbar: The DANAMIC Review - DANAMIC",
        "content": "With the way that tech has been evolving throughout the past few years, it is no surprise that nowadays, products that would\u2019ve cost a premium back then are now readily available at affordable prices to the masses.\n\nPRISM+ is most notable for their affordable monitors, but they\u2019ve since branched out to many other devices, including soundbars. We were recently offered a chance to test out the PRISM+ Ripple, one of their newer soundbars, and we jumped at the opportunity to see how good it can be.\n\nDesign and Features\n\nThe PRISM+ Ripple isn\u2019t necessarily a small soundbar, with slim, small form factor soundbars among the options that you might chance across nowadays. However, measuring 1050mm x 110mm x 73mm, it will be able to perfectly fit on most TV consoles.\n\nIt comes in a traditional metallic black finish that looks sleek and minimalistic right out of the box, meaning that for simple setups, it fits right in. The only problem is that the finish makes it somewhat of a fingerprint magnet, so for those who are rather particular about this might want to wipe it down with a cloth more frequently.\n\nThe PRISM+ Ripple also comes with a subwoofer; not something commonly included from the get-go \u2014 usually, you have to pay extra to add it on. Unfortunately, the subwoofer that comes with the soundbar is also rather big, measuring 240mm x 240mm x 420mm, meaning that space might be a little bit of an issue, though we countered this by placing it in a snug corner right beside our TV.\n\nThe PRISM+ Ripple, along with the subwoofer. The Ripple attracts fingerprints a little too well, as you can see\n\nSimilar to all of the soundbars that PRISM+ has released, the Ripple comes with Dolby Atmos, meaning that your listening experience is sure to be top-notch with it, for the depth, clarity and detail of your audio are bound to be on a whole new level.\n\nThe subwoofer comes with a 6.5\u201d down-firing speaker, which enhances bass and allows you to \u201cfeel every beat more deeply than ever\u201d. Meanwhile, the soundbar itself is equipped with 8 different speakers, advertised to deliver entertainment in its purest form.\n\nManually adjust the bass and treble levels with the included TV Remote\n\nOn paper, the Ripple also has 5 curated audio profiles \u2013 Movie, Music, News, Sports and Gaming, which will change the bass and treble levels accordingly to ensure that specific shows or scenes have clearer vocals, or better environment sounds. However, if that doesn\u2019t work for you, you can manually change the bass and treble levels with the TV remote.\n\nPerformance\n\nWhen using and testing out the Ripple, we found that firstly, the bass emitted from the soundbar is extremely strong, with even the slightest bit felt in many different songs and movies. Additionally, this was with the bass only manually set at +1, which was a bit of a surprise to me.\n\nOn the other hand, vocals were rather muffled and unclear, so we had to crank up the treble manually to a +3 and also change the audio profile to \u201cNews\u201d. This made vocals clearer, with whatever actors were saying in movies being better and more audible. But, unfortunately, it meant that the bass was sacrificed, leading to scenes feeling less impactful or tense than they would\u2019ve been.\n\n\u201cNews\u201d mode on the PRISM+ Ripple\n\nBut does that mean that the Ripple isn\u2019t any good for watching shows? Not exactly. Its good points can also be its downsides; the bass is amazing for tense and thrilling scenes, and Dolby Atmos really immerses you in the show. Take for example, the scene in Ford Vs Ferrari where driver Ken Miles wins Le Mans \u2013 The sound quality of the soundbar really makes you feel as if you were there, right at that moment when he won.\n\nJust note that if you want to watch shows that generally have a lot of conversations, you might have to crank the treble up, or you could try out the other audio profiles, for each and every person has their own preference. It is unfortunate, but it seems you can\u2019t have both bass and clear dialogue for films with the PRISM+ Ripple.\n\nMusic-wise, bass-heavy songs shine on the Ripple, with more notably, \u201cPhonk\u201d-style music sounding extra phonk-y on it. Meanwhile, other regular songs also get somewhat enhanced on the Ripple, but if you don\u2019t happen to be a big fan of bass in general, fret not, for you can manually change the bass and treble frequencies.\n\nIn terms of games, it is similar to watching shows in that it amplifies the overall gaming environment and makes it feel as if you are really in the game itself, though other than that, there isn\u2019t much else to take note of.\n\nAnother thing I liked about the Ripple was how easy it was to start using the soundbar. It is essentially a plug-and-play device that doesn\u2019t require any complicated setup process. All you have to do is connect the appropriate wires, and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nVerdict\n\nOverall, the PRISM+ Ripple is a decent mid-range choice of soundbar, coming in at an affordable price of S$499. If you want a soundbar that you can instantly plug in and start using, you should consider this.\n\nSometimes though, the strong default bass performance muffles the overall listening experience. There are also options out there which provide much better audio performance if you are willing to spare some extra coin.\n\nIf you would like to read more in-depth about the PRISM+ Ripple, you can take a look at their product page PRISM+ Official Product Page. Similarly, if you want to purchase one, you can also head to shopping platforms, Shopee or Lazada page.\n\nPhotos by Ryan Wong of the DANAMIC Team."
