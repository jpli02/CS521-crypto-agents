        "title": "'Ripples': A refreshing and hilarious skewering of Japanese society - The Japan Times",
        "content": "Post-pandemic, Japanese films about weighty topics tend to unfold with nary a laugh or smile. Irony and irreverence are out, sincerity and gravitas are in. A prominent example is \u201cPlan 75,\u201d Chie Hayakawa\u2019s dystopian drama that takes place in a near future where the government sponsors a program of euthanasia for old folks. The film firmly resists the temptations of satire and has been taken seriously as social commentary and even prophecy, with awards and accolades pouring in.\n\nIn comparison, Naoko Ogigami has never hidden her dry sense of humor, even though her recent films deal with everything from prejudice against transgender people (\u201cClose-Knit\u201d) to attitudes toward death and mourning (\u201cRiverside Mukolitta\u201d).\n\nHer latest, \u201cRipples,\u201d is laugh-out-loud funny, though her protagonist, a woman played to comic and dramatic perfection by Mariko Tsutsui, is struggling to hold on to her sanity: Yoriko\u2019s life begins to fall apart following the sudden disappearance of her husband, Osamu (Ken Mitsuishi), who flees out of terror of radiation from the crippled Fukushima No. 1 reactor after the 2011 earthquake. (The opening sequence briskly skewers the paranoia surrounding the March 11 disaster, when otherwise sane people were afraid to drink tap water and were booking plane tickets to Okinawa and beyond.)"

        "content": "Ramping up its CBDC game, Ripple announced the launch of a new platform for central banks, governments, and financial institutions to issue their own central bank digital currency.\n\nDubbed \u2018Ripple CBDC Platform,\u2019 the offering will leverage the same blockchain technology used on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The platform is developed to address multiple use cases, such as wholesale and retail CBDCs on a private ledger or issuing a stablecoin.\n\nRipple CBDC Platform\n\nAccording to the San Francisco-based blockchain company, the aim is to \u201cholistically manage and customize the entire life cycle of fiat-based central bank digital currency, transaction, and distribution.\u201d\n\nFollowing the development, James Wallis, Ripple\u2019s VP of Central Bank Engagements & CBDCs, said,\n\n\u201cAs a trusted partner to several central banks, we believe this platform will help solve problems for many central banks and governments who are devising plans and developing a technology strategy for CBDC Implementations.\u201d\n\nThe exec added that innovative capabilities of the platform are expected to help facilitate instant settlement of both domestic and cross-border payments, mitigate risk vectors, and enhance the user experience of sending and receiving digital currency on either side of a transaction.\n\nAs part of its global push for its CBDC platform, Ripple has onboarded the Republic of Palau to develop the country\u2019s national digital currency on it. Surangel Whipps Jr, President of the Republic of Palau, commented,\n\n\u201cPartnering with Ripple to help create our national digital currency is part of our commitment to lead in financial innovation and technologies, which will provide the citizens of Palau with greater financial access.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Palau\u2019s and Ripple\u2019s partnership dates back to November 2021, when the two parties announced teaming up to focus on developing strategies for cross-border payments and a USD-backed digital currency for the island nation.\n\nRipple\u2019s Participation in Digital Hong Kong Dollar\n\nIn a parallel announcement, Ripple said it will demonstrate the use case for its CBDC platform through the inaugural e-HKD Pilot Programme led by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). It is also working with Taiwan\u2019s Fubon Bank to build a product for real estate asset tokenization and equity distribution under the e-HKD pilot.\n\nThe company has teamed up with Taiwan\u2019s Fubon Bank to develop a product under the pilot program, with a focus on real estate asset tokenization and equity release leveraging the e-HKD.\n\nXRP\u2019s price remains trending upwards and has maintained its gains in an otherwise choppy market that has remained mostly flat over the past 24 hours."

        "content": "Warren Jenson will join the Ripple Board of Director as well as the company\u2019s Audit Committee as the committee\u2019s Chairperson.\n\nRipple continues to make strategic growth moves through expansions, the launch of new products and an extension of its workforce. The Silicon Valley company recently announced the addition of Warren Jenson, a celebrated financial expert who previously served as Amazon\u2019s CFO, to its team.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple\u2019s CEO, expressed his enthusiasm to welcome Jenson to the ever-expanding Ripple team. \u201cTransparency and trust are the 2 hallmarks that drive crypto forward, and Warren\u2019s decades of expertise here will be an incredible resource as we continue to grow globally,\u201d Garlinghouse remarked.\n\nThrilled to welcome Warren Jenson to @Ripple\u2019s Board and as the new Chair of our Audit Committee. Transparency and trust are the 2 hallmarks that drive crypto forward, and Warren\u2019s decades of expertise here will be an incredible resource as we continue to grow globally. https://t.co/6wNTHxuTAL \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to the official announcement, Jenson will join the firm as a member of its Board of Directors. In addition, the skilled financial expert will be incorporated into Ripple\u2019s Audit Committee as Chairperson. The move represents Ripple\u2019s attempt at growing with the rapidly-evolving crypto industry, the press release says.\n\nAs a seasoned financial expert, Jenson brings a wealth of experience to the Ripple team, having served at the frontline in several prominent firms. Notably, Jenson previously worked as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a number of leading companies, including NBC News (1992 to 1998), Amazon (1999 to 2002), and Electronic Arts (2002 to 2008).\n\nJenson would not be the first Amazon ex-employee to join Ripple. As previously reported by The Crypto Basic, Devraj Varadhan, Amazon\u2019s former Vice President of Delivery Experience, was hired by Ripple as the company\u2019s Senior Vice President (SVP) of Engineering in December 2020 \u2013 a position Varadhan occupies to this day.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRipple Expands Despite SEC Lawsuit\n\nJenson\u2019s recent integration into the team comes a few months after Ripple appointed long-term employee Monica Long as its President. The firm also added Michael Warren, a former White House Senior Advisor, to its Board last year. Ripple still looks to expand its team, as evidenced in the numerous job openings it has on its careers page.\n\nBesides the penchant to grow its team, Ripple has continued to make notable moves towards expanding its operations. CEO Garlinghouse recently disclosed that the firm has over $1 billion to deploy for an expansion into the custody and tokenization scene, as well as other industries. To this end, Ripple recently acquired Metaco, a Swiss-based digital asset and custody tokenization firm, for $250 million.\n\nThese expansion moves have prevailed despite the daunting Crypto Winter and the ongoing SEC lawsuit. Ripple seems perturbed by the negative effects of the Winter at a time when other crypto-focused companies such as Coinbase are laying off their employees."

        "title": "Supreme Court supports Ripple's argument in SEC case, backs law adaptation - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As the summary judgment approaches in the high-stakes legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) legal experts continue to speculate about the potential outcome. While the final verdict remains, uncertain, valuable insights can be gathered into possible resolutions from other ongoing legal disputes involving similar firms.\n\nIn this line, Stuart Alderoty, chief legal officer of Ripple, in a tweet on May 19, shared a significant development that could potentially reshape the interpretation of securities laws in the digital age.\n\nAlderoty highlighted a recent Twitter opinion by the Supreme Court, emphasizing the crucial role of adapting legal factors from previous cases to suit the evolving landscape of the new world. This recognition aligns with Ripple\u2019s central argument, asserting that the Howey test and its accompanying statute should be interpreted within the common law framework.\n\nThis is consistent with Ripple\u2019s argument that Howey (and its operative statute) carries the \u201csoil\u201d of common law in which an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d requires a contract for an investment that creates post-sale rights for the purchaser and obligations on the seller. 2/2 \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) May 19, 2023\n\nImplication of Supreme Court decision\n\nIt can therefore be interpreted that Ripple perceives this acknowledgment from the highest court as a powerful affirmation that bolsters its position.\n\nAt the heart of Ripple\u2019s legal argument lies the proposition that an \u201cinvestment contract,\u201d as defined by the Howey test, requires a contractual agreement for an investment that grants post-sale rights to the purchaser while imposing corresponding obligations on the seller.\n\nBy emphasizing the influence of common law on the interpretation of the statute, Ripple aims to establish that XRP does not fall under the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction as a security.\n\nAs reported by Finbold, Alderoty had criticized the SEC\u2019s position on the \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d argument, referring to the regulator\u2019s unsuccessful argument in the 1946 Supreme Court \u201cHowey\u201d case.\n\nThe SEC contended that a \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d was not essential if a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d existed, but the Supreme Court rejected this argument. Alderoty highlighted that the SEC was mistaken in the past and continues to be incorrect in its assessment of XRP.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that legal factors must be adapted to the modern world could have far-reaching consequences for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry.\n\nUnsealing Hinman documents\n\nAdditionally, during the court proceedings, a significant point of contention has been the unsealing of the Hinman documents, which provide insight into how the regulator initially categorized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as securities.\n\nRipple achieved a significant victory when the SEC\u2019s request to seal the documents was denied. Accordingly, following the court\u2019s previous directive, the documents are set to be unsealed on June 6.\n\nIn the latest development, defense lawyer James Filan, in a tweet on May 19, revealed that both parties had filed a joint letter requesting a one-week extension. They are seeking additional time until June 13, 2023, to submit public and unredacted versions of their cross-motions for summary judgment, along with the accompanying exhibits, including the Hinman materials.\n\nSince December 2020, Ripple has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC, which filed a lawsuit alleging that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering worth $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP tokens.\n\nIn the meantime, XRP continues to trade in tandem with the general market. By press time, XRP was valued at $0.47 with weekly gains of about 9%."
