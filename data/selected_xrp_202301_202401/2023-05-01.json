        "title": "Ex-Ripple Exec Shares Unbelievable Story About Vitalik Buterin and Ripple - U.Today",
        "content": "Former director of developer relations at Ripple Matt Hamilton recently weighed in on the debate surrounding the true nature of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Hamilton responded to a member of the crypto space who claimed that XRP had nothing to do with decentralization and was simply a payment network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to a crypto community member, Hamilton argued that XRP Ledger actually predates Ethereum and was created several years before the latter. He also shared the unbelievable fact that Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, used to sleep on the couch of David Schwartz, the CTO of Ripple, while trying to secure an internship with the company.\n\nDecentralization issues\n\nThe debate on the true nature of decentralized finance was ignited by Cyber Capital founder and CIO Justin Bons, who claimed that Bitcoin, XRP, BNB and XLM are not genuine DeFi projects. On the contrary, Bons listed Ethereum, Cardano and Polkadot as projects that really embody DeFi principles.\n\nHowever, XRP enthusiast Panos Mekras disagreed with Bons' assertion and claimed that XRPL, the blockchain that powers XRP, had actually pioneered DeFi. Mekras argued that it was the first blockchain to support a decentralized exchange, tokenization of assets, stablecoins and smart contract features. He added that XRPL is also decentralized and permissionless.\n\nSchwartz himself, whose couch was part of Vitalik Buterin's career ladder, previously participated in the discussion. He explained how the consensus on which XRP Ledger operates provides real decentralization of the network, even better than proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin."

        "content": "The rise of cryptocurrency has brought about a wave of new investors, eager to get in on the action and reap the rewards. Unfortunately, this has also created a new target for hackers and scammers looking to make a quick profit. One recent example of this is the hacking of the popular YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming.\n\nDidYouKnowGaming is a YouTuber with 2.4 million subscribers who creates content related to video game trivia and history. However, the channel was recently hacked by an anonymous bad actor, who used it to promote XRP cryptocurrency scams. The hacker changed the channel's profile and cover images to Ripple's logo, in an attempt to lend legitimacy to the scam.\n\nFortunately, YouTube was quick to intervene and prevent further damage. They prevented the XRP hackers from interacting with the channel's subscribers and worked with DidYouKnowGaming to regain access to his channel. However, this incident is just one example of a growing trend of hackers targeting YouTube channels to promote scams.\n\nOne of the largest YouTube creators, Linus Tech Tips, also recently reported losing access to his channels. While the exploit used by the hackers to gain access to YouTube accounts remains a mystery, it is clear that the threat to crypto investors from such hacks is prominent.\n\nThe rise of deepfakes only adds to this threat. Deepfakes are fake impersonation videos generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and they have become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Hackers often create deepfakes of celebrities and entrepreneurs to misguide crypto investors and trick them into investing in scams.\n\nFor example, hackers have created deepfakes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the past, causing confusion among investors who thought he was endorsing a particular cryptocurrency. Concerns about deepfakes escalated even further when Chinese tech giant Tencent launched a new deepfakes creation tool, allowing users to impersonate anyone for a fee.\n\nCrypto investors across the world use YouTube to learn about and research the world of cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and Web3. However, as the number of hacks and scams on the platform increases, it is important for investors to remain vigilant and take steps to protect themselves.\n\nWhile YouTube and other platforms are working to prevent hacks and scams, investors should be wary of any investment opportunities that seem too good to be true. They should also be careful about the information they consume on the platform and take the time to research any claims made in videos or comments.\n\nIn conclusion, the hacking of DidYouKnowGaming's YouTube channel is just one example of a growing trend of hackers targeting YouTube creators to promote scams. The rise of deepfakes only adds to this threat, and investors should remain vigilant when researching and investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock\n\n. . .\n\nTags"

        "content": "And yet another month has gone by without a verdict in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although several lawyers from the XRP community had estimated the chances of a verdict by the end of April to be very high, Judge Torres of the District Court in the Southern District of New York has still not issued a ruling.\n\nBut a few hours ago, a rumor now surfaced on Twitter that could imply that a decision in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC is near. However, since this is an unconfirmed rumor from an anonymous source, it should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThe Twitter account Blockchain Daily stated that Ripple and the SEC are reportedly holding an undisclosed meeting on May 8. The speculation now circulating on Twitter is that it could be about a settlement.\n\n\ud83d\udea8JUST IN: REPORTEDLY RIPPLE AND SEC TO HOLD UNDISCLOSED MEETING ON MAY 8TH \u2013 UNCONFIRMED SOURCE pic.twitter.com/LNrUVCloQ1 \u2014 Blockchain Daily (@blckchaindaily) May 1, 2023\n\nHowever, XRP community attorney John E. Deaton would \u201cbet\u201d that the rumor is false. According to him, lawyers from the SEC and Ripple can meet anytime they want. \u201cI don\u2019t think they would pick a date a week from now and then leak it out,\u201d writes Deaton, who further surmises that a settlement won\u2019t happen that way.\n\nFirst, Deaton believes a settlement would only come after a ruling by Judge Torres, and only if Ripple wins a big victory, allowing Gensler to save face and score a political victory through a settlement.\n\nSecond, according to Deaton, the SEC would not schedule a meeting because of the market manipulation allegation and risk a leak. He believes Ripple and the SEC would \u201cjust meet,\u201d which is why he makes the assumption:\n\nThis unconfirmed source sounds like someone was wanting to orchestrate a pump.\n\nWhy Would Ripple Settle After Winning?\n\nAccording to John Deaton, under certain circumstances it may make sense for Ripple to enter into a settlement after a potential victory against the SEC. This would be \u201cnot like two years ago,\u201d but would depend on the decision and whether the SEC would appeal.\n\nRipple could also be concerned about the regulatory safety of its partners. \u201cDoes Bank of America, a Ripple partner, feel comfortable with the decision or wait to see if Judge Torres gets overturned if the SEC appeals her ruling. Remember, the SEC can file a notice of appeal and withdraw it later, \u201d the lawyer writes.\n\nIn addition, Deaton thinks Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse will be happy to sign a settlement check if the SEC classifies all future sales of XRP as non-securities and does not appeal. Why? Because that would mean an immediate return of liquidity to the US. But a settlement would also only be necessary if Judge Torres does not already provide for it in her ruling.\n\nAt press time, the XRP price had not yet reacted (significantly) to the rumor. The market does not seem to give it any credibility. XRP changed hands for $0.4657.\n\nFeatured image from CoinPedia, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "The ongoing legal dispute between blockchain firm Ripple and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to drive uncertainty in the crypto community regarding which party will come out on top and the overall impact on the industry. Adding to the drama is the speculation surrounding when presiding Judge Annalisa Torres will deliver the summary judgment.\n\nIn this line, Ripple has recently commented on the potential summary judgment date in its Q1 2023 quarterly report. While Ripple anticipates that the matter will be resolved sometime this year, the company recognized that it ultimately remains up to the court to make that decision.\n\nInitially, speculation was that the case could be resolved by the end of Q1 2023. However, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has suggested that interested parties keep an eye on May 6, as he predicts that a summary judgment will be delivered on that date. This adds to the prediction by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who expects the case to be summed up in the first half of 2023.\n\nIn the quarterly report, Ripple also highlighted that one of the SEC\u2019s expert opinions on the \u201creasonable expectations of XRP purchasers\u201d was stricken from the court record, along with another SEC expert opinion on determining the cause of XRP price changes.\n\nThis move is significant for the ongoing legal battle as it narrows down the issues that will be considered in the summary judgment.\n\nRipple hits out at SEC regulatory approach\n\nFurthermore, Ripple has criticized the US regulatory approach to the crypto industry, stating that the focus has been on regulation by enforcement instead of clear rules. The company cited examples of enforcement actions, including the SEC issuing Wells Notices to Coinbase and Paxos rather than creating regulations.\n\nTo provide background, in December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple and two of its executives, Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, for allegedly offering unregistered securities in the form of XRP.\n\nThe SEC has faced criticism for its lack of clarity on what it considers security, with the ongoing Ripple case expected to bring more clarity. Despite repeated questioning, Chair Gary Gensler has yet to provide a definitive answer, including on the status of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nFor context, Ripple is currently seeking the unsealing of the Hinman speech documents, which may shed light on how the SEC initially classified digital assets.\n\nImpact on Ripple business\n\nIt is essential to mention that the ongoing legal proceedings are expected to have a possible impact on Ripple\u2019s business and on-chain metrics. However, despite this uncertainty, Ripple has maintained strong on-chain activity in the year\u2019s first three months.\n\nIn fact, transaction volumes increased by 9% to 116 million, compared to 106 million in the previous quarter. Additionally, decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes surged 34% to $115 million compared to the previous quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, by press time, XRP was trading at $0.46 with daily losses of over 2% in the last 24 hours. Over the last seven days, the token has held slight gains of 0.6%."

        "content": "People leave jobs all the time, whether they\u2019re laid off, fired, or just quit. But how do their departures affect coworkers left behind? According to a new study from the UBC Sauder School of Business, those exits can lead many others to call it quits.\n\nPeople leave jobs all the time, whether they\u2019re laid off, fired, or just quit. But how do their departures affect coworkers left behind? According to a new study from the UBC Sauder School of Business, those exits can lead many others to call it quits.\n\nThe researchers delved deeply into employment data from a major retailer that was experiencing high turnover to find out why. They reviewed data for roughly a million employees \u2014 including when they were hired, which store, which position, when they left, and why.\n\nThe study authors also had access to employee performance records, so they could evaluate whether workers were high performers or low performers.\n\n\u201cWe looked at these stores as systems, and looked at the flow of employees in and out of them over time,\u201d explained UBC Sauder assistant professor Dr. Sima Sajjadiani (she/her), who co-authored the study with John Kammeyer-Mueller and Alan Benson of the University of Minnesota. \u201cIt gave us a great opportunity to look at the immediate, short-term and long-term effects of each exit event, and compare them over time.\u201d\n\nPast studies have looked at how turnover affects remaining employees, but they typically focus on employee performance after others leave \u2014 and on the performance of the company overall. The UBC study is the first of its kind to look at the extent to which employee exits lead to even more departures, what types of exits cause the most churn, and the role that the performance level of exiting employees plays.\n\nThe researchers found that layoff announcements have a strong and immediate effect, and boost voluntary turnover among those who survive the layoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very bad news for organizations, especially if they are laying off high performers, because if those positions get eliminated, both high and low performers start quitting,\u201d said Dr. Sajjadiani. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal that people\u2019s jobs aren\u2019t secure, and the organization doesn\u2019t care about them, no matter how hard they work. So they think, \u2018I should leave as soon as possible.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen employees quit their jobs voluntarily, their departures give a more moderate boost to voluntary turnover, and it takes longer for that ripple effect to occur.\n\n\u201cTo high performers, voluntary exits are a positive signal that there are better opportunities elsewhere,\u201d said Dr. Sajjadiani. \u201cSo while employees might not leave immediately, they do begin to look for other opportunities.\u201d\n\nWhen workers are dismissed, however, their departures have a relatively small and fleeting effect \u2014 and can even reduce voluntary turnover.\n\n\u201cUsually these are people who are disruptive or abusive, or aren\u2019t doing their fair share,\u201d said Dr. Sajjadiani. \u201cWhen they go, high performers tend to stay longer, and the risk of voluntary turnover actually goes down.\u201d\n\nHowever, when a high performer is dismissed without clear justification, employers not only open themselves to legal headaches, it also sends the wrong message to other high performers. They also start heading for the door.\n\nAccording to Dr. Sajjadiani, organizations vastly underestimate the ripple effects of people leaving and the resulting human capital costs. The research also sends a clear message to organizations that they should be extremely careful when they make exit decisions, or they risk destabilizing the whole organization very quickly.\n\n\u201cCommunicating clearly and compassionately, justifying these decisions and trying to avoid the most severe course of actions are better for organizations than simply cutting people,\u201d Dr. Sajjadiani said.\n\nInterview language(s): English"
