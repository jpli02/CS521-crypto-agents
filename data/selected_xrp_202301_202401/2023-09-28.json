        "content": "Ripple is abandoning its planned acquisition of Fortress Trust, according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nThe acquisition was announced in early September, with Ripple saying at the time that it would buy the company in a cash-and-equity deal. Further details of the deal were not disclosed.\n\n\u201cThe Fortress team is incredibly talented, and has built products solving real customer problems. While this outcome is different from what was originally planned, we\u2019ll continue to support them and hope to work together in the future!\u201d Garlinghouse said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nWhen it announced the potential acquisition, Ripple called Fortress Trust a \u201cfinancial institution that provides licensed Web3 financial, regulatory and technology infrastructure for blockchain innovators.\u201d\n\nRipple was an early investor in Fortress, and Garlinghouse\u2019s social media post on Thursday said that, while the acquisition had fallen through, it would retain its stake in the company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a chance to get to know the team, its vision and technology,\u201d Garlinghouse said when Ripple announced its plans to acquire the company on Sept. 8. \u201cThey\u2019ve built an impressive business with recurring revenue and a strong roster of both crypto-native and new-to-crypto customers.\u201d\n\nA few days after the acquisition announcement, Fortress Trust CEO Scott Purcell told Fortune that the firm had lost around $12 million to $15 million worth of bitcoin, USDC and USDT in a hack. However, Purcell said the company \u201ccovered it right away.\u201d\n\nFortress Trust did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "The chairman of Softbank Group Corp. SFTBY spin-off SBI Holdings Ltd. SBHGF, Yoshitaka Kitao received $60 million in XRP XRP/USD tokens as compensation for \u201cusing and promoting\u201d Ripple according to Craig Wright, the founder of cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV (CRYPTO: BSV).\n\n\u201cKitao-san has been slowly spending the 60 million US dollars worth of tokens he was gifted. They still have some. There are absolutely no plans to implement anything. I understand why he's doing it. For the chairman of SBI $60 million to shut up and tell people that you're running things is a significant investment with no downside,\u201d Wright said in an e-mail exchange.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I wish executives [at these] types of firms would be more honest. I like Kitao, but I don't like the general attitude that is taken to the truth and ignoring how it doesn't seem to matter only impacts other people. But for $60 million you get a lot of leeway. I discussed this in one of the Japanese clubs where I had a dinner with him [Kitao] and his wife and my wife.\u201d\n\nKitao, who was a board member of Ripple Labs Inc. until last year, told crypto journal Coinpost in 2019 that \u201cevery bank in Japan will use XRP by 2025.\u201d He added that SBI was working on persuading Japanese banks to use the digital currency for cross-border remittances in time for the six-month-long Osaka Expo from May to November that year.\n\nWright said that Ripple had no plans to implement any genuine banking industry developments in its product pipeline.\n\n\u201cAs for innovation, they [Ripple] have no idea how. They don't build anything. All of these solutions are copies of other people's code and none of them are implemented correctly,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite no longer being a board member of Ripple, Kitao remains a strong supporter of XRP. In July Kitao shared news of Ripple\u2019s partial win against the SEC on his X account in which it was ruled that secondary market trades in XRP did not constitute securities sales but sales to institutions may do.\n\nKitao said in June that Ripple would likely file for an IPO if it won against the SEC at trial.\n\n\u201cIf the conclusion is reached and XRP is a coin, I think it will be a very expensive price. If the conclusion (of the trial) is positive, I think the management will immediately go public,\u201d Kitao said.\n\nWright added that Jesse Powell, the founder of US digital currency exchange Kraken, was another beneficiary of XRP tokens.\n\n\u201cOne of the main people [involved] is Jesse of Kraken and previously Mt Gox fame,\u201d said Wright.\n\nPowell was one of the first seed investors in Ripple when Jed McCaleb founded the company around a decade ago. Powell resigned from Ripple\u2019s board of directors in 2014 after McCaleb handed himself and two of his colleagues what was then 20% of the XRP token supply and subsequently resigned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no longer confident in the management nor the company\u2019s ability to recover from the founders\u2019 perplexing allocation to themselves of 20% of the XRP, which I had hoped until recently would be returned,\u201d Powell wrote on a message posted on Reddit at the time. \u201cWhile I care about the people who work there and I wish the company the best, I cannot personally continue to support the business.\u201d\n\nKraken suspended trading of XRP in March 2021 after the US Securities & Exchange Commission filed suit against the company, but it re-listed the digital currency again in 2022.\n\nPowell recently announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Kraken and taking a more product-oriented role at the exchange. \u201cI don't like that I'm going out at the bottom of the market. It would have been nice to bow out six months ago and take credit for the full rise to the top,\u201d Powell told Blockchain news site Protocol last September.\n\nWright was critical of the incestuous nature of Digital Currency Group-owned Blockchain media outlets such as CoinDesk and the venture capital funds invested in cryptocurrencies for not giving a him proper hearing on the topic.\n\n\u201cWhat annoys me most is that I don't get one round telling people about what I know publicly. Kitao won't deny it but he also wouldn't admit it,\u201d said Wright.\n\nNeither SBI or Kraken responded to requests for comment on this story."
