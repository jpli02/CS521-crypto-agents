        "content": "Supporters of Ripple\u2019s XRP Ledger reportedly see a collaboration of Ripple-owned infrastructure provider Metaco and financial institution HSBC as a sign that banks will adopt the ledger protocol and the XRP token.\n\nThat collaboration, which was announced earlier this month, has led supporters to believe the ledger and token will gain further prominence, CoinDesk reported Monday (Nov. 27).\n\nThe correlation between the products of Ripple and the banking clients of Metaco is indirect but real, Metaco CEO Adrien Treccani said in the report.\n\n\u201cThere is an indirect link, which is that the adoption of Ripple and Metaco\u2019s solutions further promotes the adoption of the XRPL as a protocol,\u201d Treccani said in the report. \u201cEvery success of Ripple the company is also a success for the XRP Ledger.\u201d\n\nHSBC said in a Nov. 8 press release that it is using Metaco\u2019s institutional platform, Harmonize, as part of the bank\u2019s new custody service for digital assets.\n\nThe bank plans to launch a new digital assets custody service for institutional clients in 2024, complementing its platform for issuing digital assets and its offering for tokenized physical gold, according to the release.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing increasing demand for custody and fund administration of digital assets from asset managers and asset owners, as this market continues to evolve,\u201d Zhu Kuang Lee, chief digital, data and innovation officer, securities services at HSBC said in the release. \u201cThrough key partnerships, HSBC is delivering the next-generation custody infrastructure that will be scalable and secure.\u201d\n\nRipple acquired Metaco in May for $250 million, saying the deal will help Ripple tap into an institutional crypto custody market that will grow to $10 trillion by 2030.\n\nThe company added that Metaco will continue to operate as its own brand, led by Treccani, and will gain access to Ripple\u2019s base of hundreds of clients and greater capital and resources.\n\n\u201cCustody is a key facet of the infrastructure required for enterprise crypto services,\u201d Ripple President Monica Long said at the time. \u201cAdding these capabilities to Ripple\u2019s already growing product solutions means we can continue to support customers as they look to utilize crypto and blockchain for real-world use cases across all phases of adoption.\u201d\n\nFor all PYMNTS crypto coverage, subscribe to the daily Crypto Newsletter."

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS\u2014 Neighborhood groups are expressing frustration over the city's proposal to buy the Broad Ripple Park Family Center.\n\nIn January, the center opened and offers an indoor walking track, gymnasium, exercise rooms, a children\u2019s play area, party rooms and other amenities including a multi-disciplinary care site operated by Community Health.\n\n\"I think because of the great success that we\u2019ve seen at the Broad Ripple Park Family Center we know that it is so much in the public benefit to pay off this building so the city can own it,\" said Councilor Keith Potts who represents District 2.\n\nWRTV\n\nRight now the city isn't making any payments on the lease. Potts says the plan was always for the city to buy the building at the end of this year.\n\n\"We think since we have a financing mechanism available to us and we\u2019re able to do so that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do,\" said Potts.\n\nUsing that financing mechanism is what's drawing concerns. The proposal is to approve the issuance of bonds in the Redevelopment District in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $26 million.\n\nMost of that money will come out of revenue generated through the midtown tax-increment financing district.\n\n\"The key to TIF is that it works primarily by investing in things that generate tax revenue and that pay them back,\" said Michael McKillip, the executive director of Midtown Indy.\n\nMcKillip says the city will take $22 million from the TIF district. It was created more than a decade ago with the purpose of strategically investing money to address community needs in Midtown. It's a 25 year economic strategy that is in year 11. McKillip says they knew the city would always buy the family center, but didn't know they would take TIF money.\n\nWRTV\n\n\"We really do want to work with the city to get transparency and communication,\" said McKillip.\n\nSome of the priorities they're looking at include a pharmacy and grocery store at 30th and Central.\n\n\"The 38th street corridor, finding some solutions to improve school safety, and street safety specifically along Central,\" said David Bacon with the Mapleton Fall Creek Development Corporation.\n\nRight now TIF generates about $2.25 million dollars a year.\n\n\"We\u2019re not opposed to the city buying the Broad Ripple Family Center. Our number one priority is finding a compromise between the city and the midtown organizations which preserves our development priorities,\" said Bacon.\n\nThe city is trying to get a deal done by the end of the year. If they don't, they'll have to pay $1 million per year in lease payments and it could delay other parks projects through out Indianapolis.\n\nThe proposal is on the agenda for Tuesday night's Metropolitan and Economic Development Committee meeting.\n\n"

        "content": "SBI Holdings, a prominent Japanese financial firm that believes greatly in Ripple and XRP, has partnered with the second-largest stablecoin issuer, Circle, to bring USD Coin (USDC) to Japan.\n\nCircle disclosed details about the new coalition in a tweet today and on its official blog. Per the notification, the collaborative alliance is to revolutionize the financial landscape in Japan through the integration of USDC and Web3 Services.\n\n\u201cThis partnership signifies a major leap in digital asset innovation and a strategic expansion for USDC in Asia,\u201d the statement read.\n\nCircle and SBI Holdings are joining forces to boost $USDC circulation and transform the financial landscape in Japan with $USDC and Web3 Services! This partnership signifies a major leap in digital asset innovation and a strategic expansion for $USDC in Asia. Read more about\u2026 \u2014 Circle (@circle) November 27, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nUSDC Coming to Japan\n\nThe report stated that this alliance that seeks to circulate USDC in Japan was established on the Japanese government\u2019s Revised Payment Services Act on stablecoin regulation. The revised act specifically outlines provisions for stablecoins backed by fiat currency.\n\nCircle prides itself on operating a fully backed stablecoin service. It claims its USDC has 100% support from \u201chighly liquid cash and cash-equivalent assets,\u201d ensuring USDC\u2019s 1-to-1 redeemability for U.S. dollars.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAlso, the firm stated that the reserves for USDC are separate from Circle\u2019s operational funds and are safeguarded in leading financial institutions. As a result, the Ripple partner and Cirlce have formalized their collaboration by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that outlines the coming of USDC to the Japanese market.\n\nPer the official notification, the initial application of the MOU will see Circle and SBI Group broaden the utilization of stablecoins within Japan. Both entities have affirmed their commitment to stablecoin-related regulations, including open communication with relevant authorities.\n\nNotably, SBI Holdings\u2019 crypto trading arm, SBI VC Trade, is now actively pursuing registration \u201cas an electronic payment instruments service\u201d to facilitate the circulation of USDC stablecoins in Japan. The report noted that this endeavor is contingent upon approval from the relevant authorities.\n\nIn addition, SBI Shinsei Bank is set to offer banking services to Circle, facilitating access to USDC and enhancing liquidity for businesses and users based in Japan.\n\nFurthermore, as an integral component of SBI\u2019s crypto portfolio strategy, SBI Group will incorporate Circle\u2019s Web3 Services solutions. This includes adopting features such as Programmable Wallet, smart contract management tools, and blockchain infrastructure.\n\nSBI Holdings: Believer in Ripple and XRP\n\nBefore Circle, SBI Holdings maintained a robust partnership with payment firm Ripple for seven years. SBI has proactively advocated Ripple\u2019s innovative solutions, particularly in cross-border payments.\n\nIn September, SBI commenced using XRP to ease international payment in countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam."

        "title": "House v. NCAA trial could have ripple effect far beyond NIL - Sports Business Journal",
        "content": "As the legal tide gathers momentum in the House v. NCAA case, slated for trial on Jan. 27, 2025, the implications extend far beyond the nuances of name, image, and likeness reform. This case and its impact, which seeks damages potentially exceeding $1 billion, could send shock waves through the NCAA and its Power Five conferences, reshaping the financial fabric of college athletics.\n\nWhat is not being talked about enough in this case is that it is not being brought against the NCAA alone. The Power Five conferences are also named defendants. Therefore, if the plaintiffs are successful, the monetary damages could be passed down to the Power Five conferences, and the schools, leaving them holding the bag and potentially putting them in an untenable financial situation, which could have a larger impact on the student athletes themselves.\n\nThis landmark case presided over by Judge Claudia Wilken, which is not a coincidence given that she is the same judge who oversaw the O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA and Alston v. NCAA lawsuits, presents a critical juncture in the evolving narrative of college athlete rights.\n\nThe House case, initiated on June 15, 2020, a year before NIL reform took effect, revolves around Grant House, Sedona Prince, and Tymir Oliver \u2014 challenging the NCAA\u2019s restraints on compensation for Division I college athletes\u2019 use of their NIL. Even in the wake of NIL reform, the case persists in seeking back pay for lost NIL revenue, including broadcast revenue, video game revenue and revenue from third-party NIL deals.\n\nCentral to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims is Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, alleging a collective conspiracy by the NCAA, member conferences, and other defendants to restrain college athletes from earning money from their NIL.\n\nAs of Nov. 3, Wilken certified class-action status to three groups of college athletes:\n\n\u2022 Football and Men\u2019s Basketball Class \u2014 consisting of all current and former college athletes who have received full grant-in-aid scholarships and compete or competed on a men\u2019s college football team or basketball team that is a member of the Power Five conferences between June 15, 2016, and Nov. 3.\n\n\u2022 Women\u2019s Basketball Class \u2014 Consisting of all current and former college athletes who have received full grant-in-aid scholarships and compete or competed on a woman\u2019s college basketball team that is a member of the Power Five conferences between June 15, 2016, and Nov. 3.\n\n\u2022 The Additional Sports Class \u2014 Except for members of the previously mentioned basketball and football classes, all current or former college athletes who competed on a Division I athletic team prior to July 1, 2021, and who received compensation for use of their NIL as a college athlete between July 1, 2021, and Nov. 3.\n\nThe damages claims for these classes are $1.4 billion and that figure can increase to $4.3 billion if treble damages pursuant to the Sherman Act apply. For their part, the NCAA and the Power Five conferences have filed a request for an interlocutory appeal regarding Wilken\u2019s decision granting class certification.\n\nWith the class certification being granted at this time, it has made the above-mentioned scenario more likely, and additionally raises the specter of whether it would be in the best interest of the NCAA and Power Five conferences to settle. Thus, the reason for the NCAA and Power Five conferences\u2019 appeal.\n\nThe impact of the potential billions of dollars in damages being sought extends far beyond the immediate concerns of NIL compensation. Large budget cuts may loom on the horizon, casting shadows over non-revenue sports such as Olympic sports and women\u2019s sports (which also carries Title IX implications). These programs, key components of the collegiate sports ecosystem, face an uncertain future as the financial stability of universities and conferences hangs in the balance. Decades of resistance to change and a lack of adaptation by the NCAA and its member institutions has clearly contributed to the precarious situation they now face.\n\nAt the same time as all of this, the NCAA has been lobbying Congress for a limited antitrust exemption in an effort to avoid the potential of being in violation of the Sherman Act. It is clear that the NCAA would also need this exemption to be retroactive in order to avoid claims of back pay, as it is facing now.\n\nCollege sports in the United States is a unique institution. They are much more than just Power Five football and basketball. Today, there are over 1,200 NCAA member institutions and 500,000 student athletes who are afforded opportunities they otherwise may not have had. Many of our Olympians would not be performing on the world\u2019s biggest stage without being afforded the opportunities that college athletics offer.\n\nAs the trial date approaches, the early stages of House v. NCAA provide the NCAA and its conferences a window to make changes and lobby for their interests. The NCAA\u2019s past arguments, citing the imminent devastation of college athletics if athletes are fairly compensated, has fallen on deaf ears in recent years.\n\nAdditionally, the hope that Congress is going to step in and allow for an antitrust exemption is placing a lot of eggs in one basket. If history tells us anything, it\u2019s that the winds of change shift frequently in D.C. That which may be a priority today is not necessarily a priority tomorrow.\n\nThe trajectory of this case will undoubtedly influence the future of college athletics, shaping the delicate dance between justice for athletes and the preservation of opportunities that define the essence of collegiate sports. It is clear that these legal challenges are not going to go away. It would behoove the NCAA and its member institutions to be proactive in their efforts to make college athletics sustainable.\n\nAnthony Bruno is chief legal officer at Athliance, an NIL management and education platform.\n\nQuestions about OPED guidelines or letters to the editor?
