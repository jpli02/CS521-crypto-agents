        "title": "SEC Counters Ripple in Effort to Appeal Groundbreaking XRP Ruling - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Judge Torres ruled in July that Ripple violated federal securities law in how it sold XRP to institutional investors, but that it had not done so with retail investors. Another judge in the same court, Judge Jed Rakoff, disagreed with the judgment when he ruled on a different case, also brought by the SEC. The regulator pointed to this in its first memo and Friday's filing as part of its bid to convince Torres to allow the so-called interlocutory appeal, allowing an appellate court to take up some legal questions while the case is still progressing in the original court."

        "title": "Ripple acquires Fortress Trust, its second acquisition in 2023 after buying Metaco for $250 million - Fortune",
        "content": "Ripple, the crypto firm perhaps best known for its ongoing fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced on Friday its acquisition of Fortress Trust, a crypto company with a financial license in Nevada.\n\nThe details of the acquisition were not disclosed, but a spokesperson for Ripple said it bought Fortress Trust, a subsidiary of Fortress Blockchain Technologies, with a mix of cash and equity.\n\n\u201cAs an early investor in Fortress Blockchain Technologies, we\u2019ve had a chance to get to know the team, its vision, and technology,\u201d Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring on this team and its technology to accelerate our business.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition follows another headline-grabbing announcement from Ripple in May, when the company said it acquired Metaco, a crypto custodian, for $250 million, one of the largest acquisitions of a crypto company this year. The purchase of Fortress Trust and its Nevada trust license also adds to a pool of regulatory permits that the company has recently amassed, which includes 30 state money-transmitter licenses and a New York BitLicense.\n\n\u201cLicenses are a powerful enabler to build and deliver best-in-class customer experiences,\u201d Monica Long, president at Ripple, said in a statement.\n\nOne of the older companies in crypto, Ripple has been a continuous shape-shifter since its launch in 2012, when its founders created the cryptocurrency XRP. Since then, the company has tried to use the digital currency in products it pitched to banks, then the remittance industry, and now the world of cross-border payments.\n\nHowever, Ripple truly became a crypto icon when the SEC sued the company and two executives in 2020, alleging that their sales of XRP were equivalent to unregistered securities offerings. Ripple vowed to fight back, arguing that XRP was a commodity, something akin to gold, silver, or sugar, not a security, or a share in profits from a common enterprise.\n\nThe fight became a microcosm of the crypto industry\u2019s broader battle with the SEC, and onlookers waited for a decision for almost three years until July, when a federal judge partially ruled in Ripple\u2019s favor in what many observers saw as a win for the industry.\n\nThe price of XRP soared after the decision, but it has since erased almost all of those gains."

Purcell was formerly CEO of Prime Trust, a crypto custodian which shut down after BitGo abandoned a deal to acquire the firm.\n\nRipple is mostly known for its role as a cross-border payments firm. The company uses a blockchain-based messaging system, akin to SWIFT, to approve speedy transactions between a network of banks and other financial institutions.\n\nRipple's partners include Britain's Modulr, Singapore's Nium and Japan's SBI Remit.\n\nThe company also uses XRP, a cryptocurrency it owns a significant portion of and has become closely associated with, for cross-border payments between banks and other financial institutions.\n\nXRP didn't move substantially on the news. The token was up about 0.4% in the past 24 hours, trading at a price of 50 cents.\n\nRipple has struggled in recent years, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission targeting the firm with a lawsuit alleging XRP should be considered a security and that its executives sold over $1 billion worth of the token to investors in an illegal securities offering.\n\nRipple had previously partnered with MoneyGram, which used XRP in a pilot to make instant transfers, using XRP as a \"bridge\" currency to move funds without the need for pre-funded accounts. Following the lawsuit, MoneyGram and Ripple abandoned their partnership in March 2021.\n\nIn July, though, Ripple secured a key victory as a judge ruled that the XRP token was \"not necessarily a security on its face.\"\n\nRipple has seen momentum in its business build recently \u2014 particularly outside the U.S., where most of its clients are based. Asked whether the ruling meant that American banks would return to Ripple to use its ODL product, Stu Alderoty, Ripple's chief legal officer, told CNBC, \"I think the answer to that is yes.\"\n\nFortress is Ripple's second acquisition this year. In May, the company agreed to buy Metaco, a Swiss provider of crypto custody services, for $250 million.\n\nA Ripple spokesperson declined to comment on the size of the deal but said that it is less than the sum Ripple paid to buy Metaco. Ripple was a minority investor in Fortress Trust's seed funding round.\n\nRipple said the deal would \"support our existing lines of business \u2014 specifically in terms of improving the customer experience within our payments and liquidity solutions.\"\n\nRipple also obtained a Nevada trust with its acquisition of Fortress Trust, adding to its growing list of regulatory permits globally.

The company told CNBC previously it was also looking to get an e-money license with the Irish central bank.\n\n\"Longer term, we anticipate there will be ways we can leverage the technology to support new initiatives on our roadmap and enable Ripple to serve a broader segment of customers and use cases,\" a Ripple spokesperson told CNBC via email.\n\nRipple is one of many players in the so-called \"crypto custody\" space, meaning it's focused on helping companies and individual users store their tokens in a secure, decentralized address without requiring all the technical knowhow.\n\nFortress Trust uses application programming interfaces, or APIs \u2014 programs that allow different apps to interact with each other \u2014 to allow companies to pull data from other bits of software, such as wallets holding cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens.\n\nPer Fortress's website, the startup works with \"crypto exchanges, NFT marketplaces, tokenization platforms, corporate brands, agencies, securities exchanges, real estate, healthcare, neobanks, sports and entertainment celebrities, musicians, influencers and other innovators.\"\n\n"
