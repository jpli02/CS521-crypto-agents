        "content": "Ripple looks to expand its services to the UK and Ireland following its partial victory in a high profile case brought by the SEC.\n\nRipple has applied for a crypto asset firm license with the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and now it\u2019s going after a payment institution license in Ireland, Sendi Young said to DL News in an article published Monday.\n\nYoung, Ripple\u2019s European managing director, confirmed the information she provided to DL News in an early morning tweet on Tuesday. Blockworks reached out to Ripple for additional information about its activities in the UK and Ireland, but the company declined to comment.\n\nThe UK\u2019s FCA approved Bitstamp\u2019s registration as a crypto asset firm in June 2023. MoonPay, Wintermute Trading and eToro are among other notable firms that have registered.\n\nIn Ireland, payment institutions need to be approved by the country\u2019s central bank, whose leader wasn\u2019t too fond of \u201cunbacked crypto\u201d as recently as May.\n\nBank of Ireland Governor Gabriel Makhlouf said in a May blog post that \u201cthe claimed benefits of \u2018unbacked crypto\u2019 should be treated with a large dose of skepticism. The purchase of such products can be similar to purchasing a lottery ticket: you might win but you probably won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThis could perhaps present a hurdle to Ripple, which is linked to the cryptocurrency XRP. Though it should be noted that Ripple says its payment solutions and XRP are separate from one another.\n\nIn fact, many banking institutions use RippleNet, an enterprise blockchain network, including Santander and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.\n\nAnd Ripple isn\u2019t just expanding in Europe. Singapore allowed Ripple in June to begin offering crypto and payment services in the southeast Asian city state.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "It\u2019s been almost two weeks since a federal court ruling settled a years-long battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC over the nature of Ripple\u2019s XRP token. Southern District of New York judge Analisa Torres ruled that the XRP token is not a security when sold to the general public, but it can be treated as a security for past XRP sales to institutional clients.\n\nThe verdict was a \u201cwin\u201d for both the company and the crypto community alike, but Stu Alderoty, chief legal officer of Ripple Labs, hinted on TechCrunch\u2019s Chain Reaction podcast that the search for regulatory clarity is far from over.\n\nThe SEC said after the ruling that the verdict in favor of Ripple on secondary markets sales was \u201cwrongly decided\u201d and the court \u201cshould not follow them.\u201d The statement was mentioned in legal documents for a separate case against Terraform Labs, and the agency said it\u2019s considering other available avenues for further review.\n\nBut Ripple won\u2019t shy away from the SEC\u2019s likely appeal, Alderoty said. \u201cWe think the judge got that right, and we think that was a faithful application of the law, and I think a court of appeals will not only affirm that but maybe even amplify that to even a greater extent.\u201d\n\nAlderoty said the Ripple case could provide clarity for other pending lawsuits. \u201cI think our case and the decision rendered by our judge will provide comfort to other judges that the SEC is just misguided.\u201d But, he said, the question that policymakers and lawyers should be asking is, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best regulatory framework that we can create that protects the integrity of the market?\u201d\n\nIn general, the industry needs a comprehensive regulatory framework, not least because without it, the U.S. is at risk of losing innovation, he said. \u201cWithout that, I don\u2019t think the crypto industry and the technology behind it, the brilliant entrepreneurs that are driving it, will be able to really realize the full potential of this technology in the U.S. and it\u2019s going to continue to move offshore.\u201d\n\nAnd that might be true. An Electric Capital report from April found that the U.S.\u2019s share of blockchain developers has fallen 2% per year in the last five years, dropping to 29% last year from 40% in 2017. Compared to other regions in the world, the drop in the U.S. is \u201ca marginal difference,\u201d Maria Shen, partner at Electric Capital, said at the time.\n\nWhile Alderoty is Ripple\u2019s lawyer, his advice to others is simple: Build a company in a country where there is a \u201cclear regulatory regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re still going to face the hostility that we see about the face of the crypto industry in the U.S.,\u201d Alderoty said. \u201cUntil we have a clear, comprehensive regulatory framework in the U.S., this is probably not the place where you want to start your business. And that\u2019s an unfortunate statement.\u201d\n\nThis story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch\u2019s podcast Chain Reaction.

        "title": "Call It \u201cThe Ripple Effect\u201d - Global Finance",
        "content": "Recent court crypto ruling offers corporates an FX alternative.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent landmark judgment that handed crypto platform provider Ripple Labs a partial victory against complaints brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to disrupt the US market and drive broader adoption of Ripple\u2019s XRP digital token, which is often used by businesses, government and financial institutions as a bridge currency. Other crypto firms such as crypto exchange operator Coinbase\u2014which is also accused of selling unregistered securities on its platform\u2014might use Ripple\u2019s win as a legal precedent.\n\nThe judgment by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP is not a security except when used for institutional sales. The ruling will also likely force US banks to innovate even faster amid the threat of greater disintermediation that broader usage of the digital token may bring. For starters, US corporate treasury departments will now have unencumbered access to XRP at a fraction of the cost of traditional banks in foreign exchange (FX) transactions.\n\nRipple also stands to gain from US banks using XRP for cross-border payments as a blockchain alternative to the payment-messaging cooperative SWIFT. And the US government is likely to be watching events closely.\n\nThe roll-out of the highly anticipated FedNow real-time payment service on July 20 allows 41 participating banks and financial institutions to offer their customers instant payments in the US. Designed by the Federal Reserve, the system uses technology powered by Volante\u2014a Ripple partner\u2014as one of the companies supporting the Fed initiative.\n\nThat has led to speculation that Ripple\u2019s indirect involvement could speed the use of XRP. The Fed is on the record saying that it assessed XRP\u2019s capabilities during research before FedNow\u2019s launch. Indeed, central bank officials have said FedNow is an attempt to modernize America\u2019s banking system and may limit the reach of private sector players such as Venmo and PayPal.\n\nFor now, FedNow is limited to domestic payments, but it is not inconceivable that it may be deployed in cross-border payments as part of the Fed\u2019s modernization efforts. Digital-first banking services are increasingly taking center stage, but the current payment rails in the US look dated and mismatched concerning consumer demand.\n\nMeanwhile, Ripple Labs could benefit if the Biden Administration pushes ahead with plans for central bank digital currency (CBDC). In May, it launched a CBDC platform that lets central banks, governments and financial institutions issue their own CBDC, leveraging the same blockchain technology used by the XRP Ledger.\n\nRipple\u2019s partial victory is also a much-needed shot in the arm for the cryptocurrency sector, which remains weighed down by the specter of regulatory uncertainty. The hawkish stance of regulators, notably the SEC, has stifled innovation and driven business abroad, leading some analysts to claim the US is falling behind other major economies in the crypto space.\n\nConsidering such observations, the US Congress faces growing pressure to provide regulatory clarity and rein in so-called \u2018regulation by enforcement\u2019 that has hampered the domestic crypto and digital assets. Unsurprisingly, Ripple is highly bullish on the disruptive ability of cryptocurrencies, particularly in the payment space. In early July, it published a report in which the authors estimated that more than 65% of the US population is expected to use mobile banking by 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile money payments reached a staggering $1.26 trillion in 2022, according to the GSM Association\u2019s State of the Industry Report on Mobile Money 2023, which the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded. There are now 174 million money agents globally servicing the mobile payments sector, the authors note, in what must be the mother of all wake-up calls for banks.\n\nStill, some legal analysts predict Ripple\u2019s victory against the SEC could be short-lived if the regulator decides to appeal the judgment. Such an outcome would deal a heavy blow to the recuperating crypto sector.\n\nIndeed, it would cause quite a ripple."
