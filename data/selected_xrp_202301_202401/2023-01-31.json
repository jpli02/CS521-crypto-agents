        "content": "The electricity authority (EAC) will not be in a position to install smart meters for its residential customers according to the timeframe it announced to parliament in December, sources reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe installation of remote smart-metering systems appears to be mired in tendering process delays, according to daily Philenews, and is highly unlikely to start until March at the earliest.\n\nThe transmission and distribution operators recently stated that smart metering and a remote (ripple) control mechanism were primary technical prerequisites for securing stability and safety of the grid and would enable them to disconnect users whenever a critical limit in renewable energy absorption gets reached.\n\nIn a letter to the ministry, the operators requested a halt on the approval of new permits for residential photovoltaics (PVs) until an updated subsidy plan was announced requiring PVs and smart meters to be installed in tandem.\n\nA 2018 decision of the energy regulatory authority (CERA) required installation of 400,000 meters, and the first installation, of 57,143 meters, was to have been completed by January 2021. By January this current year, almost 180,000 smart meters should have been installed with a budget of \u20ac17 million granted to EAC for this phase of the project."

        "content": "A judge clarified that LBRY Credit Tokens, known as LBC, are only considered securities at the time of direct sale, a ruling that could potentially bode well for Ripple.\n\nDuring an appeal hearing in New Hampshire Monday, the judge said the summary judgment handed down in November, which sided with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), does not apply to secondary sales of LBC.\n\nThe SEC sued LBRY in March 2021 for offering LBC tokens without registering with the agency. Although the LBRY team did not offer tokens to the public in an initial coin offering (ICO) or similar mechanism, they did keep tokens for themselves in a \u2018pre-mine,\u2019 which were subsequently released on secondary exchanges to fund operations, the SEC alleged.\n\nIn the summary judgment, the judge argued that the tokens incentivized the team to build the network, suggesting to investors that LBC would be a profitable investment on the secondary market.\n\n\u201cLBRY has \u2014 at key moments and despite its protestations \u2014 been acutely aware of LBC\u2019s potential value as an investment,\u201d the summary judgment reads. \u201cAnd it made sure potential investors were too.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s ruling may be a positive sign for Ripple, which is facing its own SEC lawsuit over its XRP tokens, which the regulator alleges were distributed in an unregistered security offering.\n\nRipple has maintained that it never formally held an ICO, similar to the LBRY situation.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe case will be decided in a summary judgment, which both Ripple Labs and the SEC agreed to in November 2022.\n\nIn a small win for Ripple, the judge on the case ruled in September that the \u201cHinman documents,\u201d emails between former SEC officials regarding ether\u2019s classification, are permissible evidence.\n\nIn April 2022, Empower Oversight, a nonprofit whistleblower organization, released more than 200 emails, including Hinman\u2019s, obtained via Freedom of Information Act request between current and former SEC employees.\n\nThe group claimed the emails prove there were conflicts of interest associated with how the SEC selected enforcement actions against digital asset companies, specifically the agency\u2019s decision not to view ether the same as XRP.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Yesterday, the US Federal Reserve Board announced a new payment system. While the new project has shocked some in the crypto community, the Ripple community seems to be thrilled about the new settlement service.\n\nThe Near-Instant FedNow Service\n\nAccording to an announcement published yesterday, the Federal Reserve Board is developing a new \u201cround-the-clock\u201d real-time payment and settlement service dubbed \u201cFedNow\u201d.\n\nFedNow will feature near-instantaneous transactions that will be processed every day of the week, including weekends, 24/7.\n\nThe announcement read in part:\n\nThe rapid evolution of technology presents a pivotal opportunity for the Federal Reserve and the payment industry to modernize the nation\u2019s payment system and establish a safe and efficient foundation for the future.\n\nIn addition to FedNow, the Federal Reserve Board also announced that it has been exploring expanding its FedWire Funds and National Settlement services to provide 24x7x365 support as well as faster payments.\n\nRipple Community Is Thrilled\n\nThe Fed\u2019s announcement has generated such hype in the Ripple community that the number of FedNow and Ripple-related searches has increased significantly on Google.\n\nCurious to see @Ripple\u2018s response to Fed Now. It\u2019s clear (at least some) $XRP holders are feeling the heat \u2013 just check Google searches. Not trying to spread FUD, but looking forward to see how this plays out. Thanks @FluidFluxation for bringing this to my attention. pic.twitter.com/1aKC0Q5Jkf \u2014 The Crypto Dog\ud83d\udcc8 (@TheCryptoDog) August 6, 2019\n\nMore Good News For Ripple?\n\nWhile neither the federal government nor Ripple has officially confirmed that FedNow will use Ripple\u2019s network or even blockchain technology, Ripple\u2019s Global Head of Infrastructure Innovation, Dilip Rao, tweeted yesterday that the launch of the FedNow Service was a \u201cgreat move\u201d.\n\nGreat move! #FedNow will drive the transformation to real-time payments infrastructure around the world: both domestic and cross-border! @Ripple mission #IoV http://t.co/hpRQ1YYGKI \u2014 Dilip Rao (@diliprao) August 5, 2019\n\nRipple is already part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Faster Payments Task Force, with the company\u2019s Head of Research on the Business Development team, Ryan Zagone, elected as a member of its steering committee in 2015.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ripple published a blog post in July 2017 regarding the Fed Task Force action plan for faster payments. According to Ripple, the action plan highlighted \u201cRipple\u2019s ability to underpin the next generation of cross-border payments.\u201d\n\nThe organization has more good news incoming, as the payments company MoneyGram recently revealed that it was piloting Ripple\u2019s xCurrent network and XRP for cross-border transactions.\n\nThis article was first published on: Aug 6, 2019"

        "content": "The announcement comes from the prime minister of Montenegro, his nation is collaborating with Ripple (XRP) to develop a Central Bank CBDC.\n\nDritan Abazovic made the announcement via Twitter, Montenegro has kicked off the project for its own stablecoin. The collaboration originated in a meeting in Switzerland, where the Prime Minister of Montenegro met with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Vice President James Wallis.\n\nProduktivan sastanak sa CEO kompanije @Ripple @bgarlinghouse i VP za saradnju sa centralnim bankama #JamesWallis. Razgovarali smo o razvoju platne infrastrukture koja bi obezbijedila ve\u0107u finansijsku dostupnost i inkluziju. Crna Gora otvorena za novu vrijednost i ulaganja. \u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/YdPeWHUtCm \u2014 Dr Dritan Abazovic (@DritanAbazovic) January 18, 2023\n\nRipple (XRP) will help Montenegro in the project\n\nMontenegro is one of the countries vying to become an EU member, the application has yet to be approved. While not yet a member, the country uses the Euro as its state currency. The EU currency is not for all intents and purposes the state currency, but despite this, it is treated as such by the government.\n\nThe project in collaboration with Ripple to create a stablecoin directly from the Central Bank may provide interesting developments on the Euro affair.\n\nMontenegro has been waiting for acceptance as a member of the European Union since 2008 now. The Balkan country has also been using the Euro since 2002, more than twenty years now. The new project formalized by the prime minister, of the creation of the CBDC, together with Ripple, could fill the gap of a national currency to call its own. Ergo, a potential symbolic identity to the nation.\n\nThis is not the first time Montenegro has opened up to the blockchain and cryptocurrency universe.\n\nBack in April last year, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, attended an event focused on the crypto world in Montenegro and was subsequently granted Montenegrin citizenship.\n\nMontenegro seems really taken with the project, but especially with the idea of a banking innovation for the country.\n\nIvan Boskovic, the former director of the Department of Payment Systems and Financial Technology at the Central Bank of Montenegro, has published several articles about it.\n\nOne of the latest articles is precisely about the possible banking innovation that Montenegro may have over the next few months, with the title, \u201cCentral Bank of Montenegro: How to Drive Banking and Payment Innovations in a Small Developing Economy.\u201d\n\nGrowth in the financial sector, according to Ivan Boskovic, is synonymous with long-term growth for the country as a whole. Developing economies like Montenegro, can benefit a lot from these kinds of innovations.\n\nObviously, both the economic and risk commitment is greater than in large world economies, the obstacles to overcome are far greater. But the results they could bring to a nation, such as Montenegro for example, are many indeed.\n\nFor its part, the Ripple company over the years has specialized a great deal in terms of creating CBDCs. In 2021 in fact, it created a private ledger for central banks to be able to test their stablecoins.\n\nMany nations have plans to digitize their currency\n\nAlthough Montenegro\u2019s project is aimed precisely at creating its own monetary identity, the plan to create a digital currency directly from the Central Bank does not belong only to the Balkan nation.\n\nThere are many states that are considering, or even implementing, the idea of a CBDC.\n\nA report by the Bank of International Settlement (BIS), showed that about 80% of banks around the world are planning to create their own digital currency.\n\nBut not only that, the same report highlighted that 40% of nations around the world are already in the experimental stage.\n\nAmong the various projects, one of the most ambitious is that of the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which has already announced its plan for experimentation, which will begin this spring and will involve consumers and private sector companies.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the already initiated project of Turkey, which in early January carried out the first tests of its Digital Lira.\n\nThe first trial of the Digital Turkish Lira was successful, with Central Bank of Turkey (TCMB) officials expressing great satisfaction with the test results.\n\nThere are many public news stories that can be accessed to find out more about the various projects involving countries around the world in the use of digital currencies. The United States, England and Australia have also announced the start of projects related to this.\n\nThe data show us that countries with a developing economy are the most likely to start projects quickly, while European and Central American countries seem to be going more cautiously.\n\nThe reasons why are clear: a digital currency would promote the inclusion of a large part of the population in the financial world. Furthermore, cash is slowly disappearing and digital payments are going through private systems, a digital currency would make this transition obsolete."

        "content": "Buffye Brown held up her 2-year-old nephew at the Minnesota Capitol Tuesday and pleaded with people experiencing domestic violence: If they can\u2019t leave for themselves, \u201cDo it for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one who\u2019s got to grow up now wondering why mommy never came home, why daddy would do something so wrong,\u201d she said.\n\nBrown\u2019s sister, Latifa Tasha Minor Brown, was fatally shot in St. Paul last January. Her long-term boyfriend was sentenced to prison for Latifa\u2019s murder. Buffye Brown brought the couple\u2019s son with her to a memorial service for people killed last year in domestic violence situations.\n\nThere were 24 known victims in Minnesota last year \u2014 21 allegedly died at the hands of a current or former partner, and three were bystanders killed in domestic violence-related situations, according to Violence Free Minnesota.\n\nIn the last decade, the number of victims of domestic violence-related homicides ranged from a high of 37 in 2013 and a low of 14 in 2018, Violence Free Minnesota data shows. There was an average of 26 such victims a year between 2013 and 2022.\n\n\u201cThose lives that are lost\u201d have \u201ca ripple effect,\u201d said Guadalupe Lopez, Violence Free Minnesota executive director, at Tuesday\u2019s memorial. \u201cWe are all connected in many different ways and so when we lose a community member, whether we know them or not, it does impact us.\u201d\n\nViolence Free Minnesota and other organizations are advocating this legislative session for an additional $25 million annually for crime victims\u2019 services, which would nearly double the amount of state dollars currently allocated for such services. The base state funding hasn\u2019t seen an increase in more than eight years, according to Violence Free Minnesota.\n\nVictims from age 13 to 66\n\nThe people killed due to domestic violence last year \u201cwere mothers, daughters, sisters, brothers, sons, cousins, friends, and they all brought so much joy and love to those around them,\u201d said Joe Shannon, Violence Free Minnesota communications program manager.\n\nThe oldest were 66-year-olds \u2014 Linda Marie Johnson, of St. Paul, and Christine Kaja Nygard, of Motley. They were both beaten to death. Johnson\u2019s husband was sentenced to prison for murder. Nygard\u2019s boyfriend is charged with first-degree murder.\n\n\u201cChristine loved her grandkids and spending time with her family, as well as being outside and gardening,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cLinda was an avid fan of the Twins and Wild and collected Tinker Bell memorabilia.\u201d\n\nThe youngest victim last year was 13-year-old Isaac Hoff, of Olivia.\n\n\u201cHe was killed while defending his mother who was being assaulted and strangled by her boyfriend,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cIsaac was a spunky but big-hearted young man whose mother and baby sister meant the world to him.\u201d\n\n\u2018Systemic failures\u2019\n\nIn at least half of last year\u2019s domestic violence homicides, the perpetrator or alleged perpetrator \u201chad a documented history of abuse against a current or former intimate partner,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cThis means that in at least 12 instances, the criminal legal system was aware of the abuse and the risk of homicide, but not enough was done to keep the victim safe.\u201d\n\nHe said there are \u201cglaring and horrifying examples of systemic failures that led to the loss of lives,\u201d including:\n\nKelli Ranning Goodermont\u2019s ex-boyfriend, who is charged with stabbing her and setting her on fire at their St. Paul workplace in March, \u201chas an extensive history of violence, and court records stated he posed a substantial likelihood of causing physical harm to others,\u201d Shannon said.\n\nLynnie Ann Loucks\u2019s boyfriend \u201chad a history of intimate partner violence in two states, violated several protection orders and even threatened a police officer during questions after one of the violations,\u201d according to Shannon. She was killed in Crow Wing County in April.\n\nKatie Ann Fredrickson, whose boyfriend pleaded guilty to fatally shooting her in Brooklyn Center in July though he was barred from possessing firearms due to a conviction for violent crime. He was convicted of illegal firearm possession in 2006, 2014 and 2015, Shannon said.\n\nWhen police responded to two calls to Kari Jo Petrich\u2019s home in the days before she was killed in June in Hibbing, she spoke directly with police and told them her boyfriend struck her in the face. \u201cShe died 24 hours after officers provided her no support,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cAnd the medical examiner stated if she had received medical care in that time period, she would have survived.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sister\u2019s heavenly light\u2019\n\nLatifa Brown, 31, and Mark Bell Jr. were in a relationship for 11 years. Brown told her sister and police about Bell abusing her.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking to myself, \u2018Please know your worth,'\u201d Buffye Brown said Tuesday of her sister. \u201c\u2026 I have two brothers and two sisters who were telling (her) the same thing. My father would tell her the same thing. And it was like no matter how much we said it, (Bell\u2019s) words were always more powerful than ours.\u201d\n\nBell hadn\u2019t previously been charged with domestic violence and he said at his sentencing that he was not abusive to Brown.\n\nLatifa Brown loved cooking, dancing and being a mom, her sister said. Through Buffye Brown\u2019s grief in the last year, she said Latifa\u2019s son has given her a reason to continue on \u2014 \u201cmy sister\u2019s heavenly light,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEvery time I hear him laugh, I hear her,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time I see him smile, I say she\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nAt least 23 minor children were left without a parent due to domestic violence homicides last year in the state, according to Violence Free Minnesota.\n\nAs Buffye Brown spoke Tuesday with her 2-year-old nephew by her side, she said she knows it\u2019s not easy to leave domestic violence situations.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going through it now, please get out and run,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 If you don\u2019t do it for (yourself), do it for your beautiful babies. Do it for your brothers and your sisters, your mommy and your daddy.\u201d\n\nDomestic violence help\n\nThe Minnesota Day One Crisis Hotline can be reached 24/7 at 866-223-1111."
