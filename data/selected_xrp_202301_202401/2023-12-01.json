        "title": "Ripple XRP Forecasted to Rally 1500% to $10: Here's When - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Ripple\u2019s XRP token has surged by over 80% since the beginning of the year. A US court ruling that Ripple\u2019s sale of XRP to retail clients did not breach securities laws was a significant force in pushing the asset\u2019s price. However, many analysts believe Ripple XRP has yet to show its full potential, and can potentially reach $10 soon.\n\nAccording to cryptocurrency analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, Ripple XRP could reach $10 or $50, depending on its trajectory. If XRP touches a price of $10, it translates to growth of over 1530% from current levels. On the other hand, if XRP hits $50, it would mean a rally of over 8000%.\n\nSource: EGRAG CRYPTO\n\nAlso Read: Ripple XRP Nearing $1B in Trading Volume With $1 Price Nearing\n\nEGRAG CRYPTO cites historical data to back his claims. The analyst points to XRP\u2019s 8000% rally from March 2017 to May 2017. Moreover, from July 2017 to November 2017, XRP surged by 1,506%. The analyst says the token could take one of two routes depending on how things unfold.\n\nAccording to EGRAG CRYPTO, XRP could surge by 1506% if it consolidates for five months, replicating the late 2017 rally. However, if the token faces a 12-month consolidation, it could lead to an 8000% rally. Either way, EGRAG anticipates XRP to hit new highs.\n\nWill Ripple\u2019s XRP hit a new all-time high?\n\nSource \u2013 Bitcoin.com\n\nEGRAG CRYPTO\u2019s forecast does not anticipate XRP to hit a new all-time high anytime soon. However, many analysts expect a crypto market bull run in 2024. Some even believe Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies could hit new highs next year. If the other currencies hit new peaks, XRP might also follow.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple: Over 500 Companies Use XRP as a Bridge, Can it Hit $1?\n\nThe token hit its highest price in January 2018, almost six years ago. Moreover, the token has seen significant institutional adoption in the last few years. Increased adoption and a market rally could push XRP\u2019s price to a new all-time high in 2024."

        "content": "Pictures of the center presented at the meeting. (City of Indianapolis)\n\nThe city moved one step closer to the purchase of the Broad Ripple Park Family Center this week. The measure uses TIF, or tax-increment financing, money to pay for the center, and many in the community are not happy.\n\nA proposal passed by a Metropolitan and Economic Development Committee will allow the use of $22 million from the Midtown TIF district to buy the center, which opened up this year in Broad Ripple. The Midtown TIF was created 10 years ago to benefit five neighborhoods, and Councilor John Barth said that\u2019s what made it unique. TIF districts create funding by setting up a development area that captures future tax dollars.\n\n\u201cIn other words neighborhoods aren't fighting each other for resources, but instead they're using the TIF as a vehicle to ensure that a rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d Barth said.\n\nThe Midtown Economic Council was set up to advise and manage project ideas and make sure the TIF money was used equitably across the area. At the committee meeting, members of the MEC said they did not get a chance to weigh in.\n\nMidtown Indy Executive Director Michael McKillip said the move is unfair.\n\n\u201cIt effectively ends a 25-year strategy. I think you will hear folks say that some revenue will be available. But the last 16 years of this TIF strategy has a lot of work to be done,\u201d McKillip said.\n\nThe midtown council had been considering plans including a grocery store and affordable housing project.\n\nThe holding company that owns the family center gave the city a year payment abatement, but if it\u2019s not purchased now the price will increase. The agreement created health care inside the family center through a partnership with Community Health.\n\nNumerous councilors expressed frustration about the process. Ultimately the proposal passed with a unanimous vote.\n\nCouncilor Michael-Paul Hart said the move may serve as a teaching moment when it comes to the management of TIF districts.\n\n\u201cThat learning lesson being when that council was developed there was no guardrails on how the funds were used specifically towards revenue generating investments,\u201d said Hart.\n\nThe proposal heads to the full council for a final vote next week."

        "title": "Ripple Foods Raises $49M in Funding as Pea Milk Category Soars - Green Queen Media",
        "content": "4 Mins Read\n\nUS pea milk maker Ripple Foods has secured $49.2M in its latest funding round, taking total investment in the company to over $274M. The financing comes amid a rise in interest in the pea milk category, which outpaced the overall alt-dairy segment year-on-year (but has been down in recent weeks leading up to July).\n\nRipple Foods\u2019 $49.2M investment takes the Californian pea milk brand\u2019s total capital raised to more than $274M. According to an SEC filing \u2013 first reported by Forbes \u2013 the funding came from a total offering of $55.4M via equity, debt, and securities that can be acquired upon the exercise of an option or warrant in the future.\n\nThe latest funding round follows a $60M Series E raise in 2021, which was led by S2G Ventures, Bloom8 and Ajax Strategies. Other previous investors include TAO Capital, Siddhi Capital, Prelude Ventures, Khosla Ventures and GroundForce Capital.\n\nCourtesy: Ripple Foods\n\nCreating a ripple in the alt-milk sector\n\nThe investment is among a very small number of large VC investments to women-led businesses \u2013 Pitchbook data shows that women-founded startups receive less than 2% of all VC. While Ripple, which makes plant-based milk and protein shakes from yellow peas, was founded in 2014 by two men, Adam Lowry and Neil Renninger, it is currently helmed by a female CEO, Laura Flanagan.\n\nWhile there hasn\u2019t been a statement about the latest funding, Flanagan had noted after the Series E raise that the company was outpacing the expansion of the overall plant-based milk industry by threefold, and was well-positioned to further accelerate this growth: \u201cThis capital raise will enable us to accelerate innovation and growth across product categories, and expand into new channels and global markets. It allows us to further achieve our mission of making plant-based foods that are better for people, and better for the planet, on an even larger scale.\u201d\n\nSince then, Ripple has added a blended Oatmilk + Protein oat and pea milk (though it seems to have been out of stock for a while) to its lineup of vanilla (sweetened and unsweetened), chocolate, original and sweetened milks. It expanded its kid-friendly line too, with an unsweetened version joining the original DHA- and calcium-rich milk. Moreover, its smoothies come in chocolate, coffee and vanilla flavours.\n\nThe company\u2019s USP is its pea protein, called Ripptein, which is made from patent-pending tech that eliminates \u201cthe impurities like flavonoids and tannins that can give other plant-based milks their plant-ey flavour\u201d, resulting in what it claims is the \u201cpurest, cleanest-tasting non-dairy milk\u201d.\n\nCourtesy: Ripple Foods\n\nThe US pea milk market\n\nRipple\u2019s raise comes at a curious period for plant-based milk in the US. In 2022, it saw a 9% annual growth in dollar sales, which reached $2.8B, commanding 15.4% of the total milk market. This sector also penetrated 41% of households, with 76% of consumers repeating their purchases. Despite this rise, unit retail sales were down by 2% from 2021, suggesting the growth comes on the back of price hikes.\n\nIn fact, Ripple was among the top 10 leading brands in terms of alt-milk sales in 2022, when the pea milk category grew by over 27% year-on-year. And while that trend has continued over the past year \u2013 with SPINS data showing an increase in dollar sales by 17.3% and unit sales by 4.1% for the 52 weeks to July 16, 2023 \u2013 this market has faltered in recent weeks, seeing a 4.8% drop in dollar sales and 2.8% drop in unit sales in the 12 weeks ending July 16.\n\nIn contrast, the overall plant-based dairy sector saw dollar sales rise by 7% and unit sales fall by 5.4% year-on-year, but has experienced a fall in both metrics in the 12-week period (-3.6% and -2.5%, respectively). Similarly, while conventional dairy dollar sales were up by 4.6% annually, unit sales declined by 2.3% \u2013 and in the 12 weeks to July 16, both were down (-3.6% and -2.5%, respectively).\n\nSo while the pea milk segment has seen a slightly larger decrease in the number of packs sold as well as total sales in recent weeks, it has outpaced both conventional and the overall plant-based dairy sectors in the last 12 months. And as health becomes an even larger influence on purchasing decisions in the US \u2013 with Gen Zers going vegan more for health than environmental reasons, and brands pushing nutritional aspects in product messaging \u2013 you could make the case that Ripple is poised for growth.\n\nCourtesy: VMG Creative/Ripple Foods\n\nThe brand\u2019s pea milk is soy- and nut-free (making it more inclusive for people with allergies), and has half the sugar, 50% more calcium and the same amount of protein compared to semi-skimmed cow\u2019s milk. Ripple is also synonymous with the North American pea milk industry, where it\u2019s available in over 20,000 retail locations.\n\nThe sector includes players like fellow Californian brand Bolthouse Farms and Swedish producer Sproud. Perhaps its closest challenger at present, though, is Chilean food tech company NotCo, which uses yellow pea protein as a primary ingredient in some of its alt-milks. It has raised over $433M to date, and just launched a vegan mac and cheese with Kraft Heinz."

        "content": "Credit: Ripple Foods.\n\nRipple Foods, a US supplier of dairy alternatives, has raised $49.2m in its latest funding round.\n\nThe latest round follows a $57.3m series E in 2021, $55.8m series D in 2020, and $65m series C in 2018. The latest funding round comes even as the wider plant-based milk category slows and competition hots up.\n\nRipple Foods\u2019 value proposition resides in its proprietary trademarked pea protein, Ripptein, which is used across its portfolio of products, including its pea milk and its protein shakes. The brand claims its patent-pending method to extract this protein from yellow peas removes the unsavoury taste associated with impurities like flavonoids and tannins.\n\nWhile not commenting on Ripple\u2019s overall performance, a press release in July commented on the \u201cexplosive growth\u201d of its kids products, with Ripple Kids Original Milk becoming one of the fastest-growing products across all retail channels in the refrigerated plant-based milk category over the past year.\n\nBloomberg reported last year that sales of its kids\u2019 offering have more than doubled expectations since launching in 2021, with distribution expanding by more than 10,000 locations in 2022.\n\nNot all of the company\u2019s innovations have been successful, however. Its first attempt at producing Greek-style, dairy-free yogurts, for example, was a commercial flop, encountering scalability issues and falling short of consumers\u2019 texture expectations.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?
