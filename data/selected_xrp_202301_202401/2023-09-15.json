        "content": "Rise\u2019n Roll Bakery will soon close its two Indianapolis locations and move with plans to relocate to Nora and expand into Hamilton County, the company said in a statement.\n\nSaturday, Sept. 16 will be the downtown shop\u2019s last day of operation since opening at 107 E New York St in 2021. The store will relocate to Nora Plaza in October.\n\nOnce the Nora Rise'n Roll store opens, the Broad Ripple bakery at 6311 E Westfield Blvd will close.\n\nCasey McGaughey, president of MCL Restaurant and Bakery which operates the local Rise'n Roll shops, cited a decrease in office workers downtown as motivation to relocate to the northside. Once that decision was made, the company started looking farther north for a second location rather than maintaining its Broad Ripple store.\n\nRise'n Roll is one of several businesses impacted by fewer people working downtown. City Market, which relied heavily on lunch crowds of nearby office workers, will close next year for renovations amid plummeting sales.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\u201cThe moves are tactical,\u201d McGaughey said. \u201cBy transitioning downtown to Nora and considering Broad Ripple\u2019s closeness to the new location, it makes sense to consolidate and set our sights on the north for our next store.\u201d\n\nFood truck party:Saraga International Grocery in Castleton to host food festival Sunday\n\nThe company said it is planning to expand into Carmel or Westfield.\n\nRise\u2019n Roll, which is based in Middlebury, Ind. currently has stores in Greenwood and Fishers, but for the meantime will abandon its presence downtown.\n\nThe bakery, which was founded in 2001 by an Amish couple before it was purchased and franchised in 2009, was recently named among the best donuts in America by The Underground Donut Tour.\n\nContact Bradley at bhohulin@gannett.com.

        "content": "Ripple Labs, the fintech company behind the popular payments protocol, has expanded its liquidity hub to new regions as the platform continues to meet the crypto demands of customers.\n\nIn a blog post, Ripple\u2019s head of liquidity products, Brad Chase, revealed that the company has opened up the liquidity hub for customers in Brazil and Australia, in line with several new features and functionalities added to the platform.\n\nRipple Expands Liquidity Hub\n\nRipple launched its liquidity hub in April, 18 months after announcing its intention to release the product in 2021. CryptoPotato reported that Ripple aims to use the platform to assist financial firms looking to offer crypto trading services by bridging the gap between digital assets and fiat.\n\nThe Ripple Liquidity Hub promotes the mainstream adoption of crypto assets by functioning as a standalone solution that enables businesses to manage their multi-asset liquidity needs. Initially available in select U.S. states, the hub leverages a smart order routing service to source cryptocurrencies from platforms like exchanges, over-the-counter desks, and market makers.\n\nSome assets available in Ripple\u2019s liquidity pools include bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT), and Litecoin (LTC). XRP is currently unavailable due to the company\u2019s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple intends to add support for the token when the case is concluded and regulatory clarity is achieved.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Ripple hub lessens the need to pre-fund capital positions to source liquidity across multiple platforms because it has assembled all major crypto asset pairs in one venue.\n\nNew Features and Functionality\n\nAlongside opening up the liquidity hub to Brazil and Australia, Ripple introduced liquidity for some new crypto assets on the hub, with plans to add support for other tokens to meet customers\u2019 demands. The company included new trading UI features and improved service level agreements for crypto deposit processing to enhance customer experience in various segments.\n\nRipple disclosed that it expanded to the new regions because of existing solid connections to its other businesses and the presence of firms looking to adopt crypto to meet their customers\u2019 payments and liquidity needs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about a number of new features coming soon, including a sandbox environment and added functionality to continue improving the experience for our customers,\u201d Chase said."

        "title": "Palau Ceases Ripple Based Stablecoin On Friday, Here's Why - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Jay Hunter Anson, the director of the Digital Residency Office at Palau\u2019s Ministry of Finance, announced the temporary suspension of the Ripple-based Palau Stablecoin (PSC) pilot program. The announcement came via Twitter, where Anson stated, \u201cOn Friday we will cease distribution of the Palau Stablecoin. For those with PSC still in their wallets, you will have until 15 September to spend it before it is frozen in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nThe Pilot And Its Premise\n\nIssued at the end of July 2023, the Palau Stablecoin (PSC) was a collaborative effort between the Republic of Palau and Ripple, the blockchain-based digital payment protocol. The stablecoin was issued on the XRP Ledger and was backed by the U.S. Dollar. The pilot program involved government employees and selected local merchants in Palau, including Surrangel and Sons, The Penthouse Hotel, and King\u2019s Minute Mart.\n\nJay Hunter Anson had previously extolled the virtues of the project, stating, \u201cThis is a prototype digital currency going through pilot testing that has the potential to revolutionize the way goods and services are paid for in Palau.\u201d The stablecoin was designed to offer a \u201cfee-free\u201d secure, transparent, and convenient option for payments, aiming to be more efficient than other online payment services.\n\nThe exact reasons for the abrupt termination of the Palau Stablecoin have not been explicitly stated. However, Anson did mention that a survey would be sent to all participants in the pilot program. \u201cYour feedback is critical to developing our final report to the Palau Congress and the President. If we are authorized to move forward with the next phase of the stablecoin program, our collective lessons learned will shape the way ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nGiven the request for feedback, it seems plausible that the Palau Stablecoin found its regular testing end after about two months. Moreover, Anson had previously noted, \u201cThe pilot project will be evaluated after two months with the decision on whether to expand it further.\u201d\n\nThe Palau Stablecoin was built on Ripple\u2019s CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) platform, an end-to-end solution designed for central banks to issue their own digital currencies. The platform allowed Palau to manage and customize the entire life cycle of the stablecoin, from minting to redemption.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Palau And Ripple?\n\nWhile the pilot program is coming to an end, the future of the PSC in Palau remains uncertain. The government has until the end of September to process retailer redemptions, and the lessons learned from this pilot could inform future fintech initiatives in the country.\n\nAs for Ripple, the cessation of the Palau Stablecoin project could serve as a case study for refining its CBDC platform and strategies for future collaborations with governments and financial institutions around the world.\n\nAt press time, XRP traded at $0.5002.\n\nFeatured image from Times Tabloid, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, effectively ending the right to abortion, which had existed for nearly 50 years. The decision has led to a wave of laws to restrict abortion access in about half the states in the nation. Not only have patients had to cross state lines to end pregnancies which pose a risk to their health, some doctors have also fled states like Idaho where performing abortions could result in imprisonment.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nDr. Stella Dantas is an obstetrician and gynecologist in Hillsboro, and the president-elect of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She joins us to explain the ripple effect that restricting abortion access is having on reproductive healthcare, especially for underserved communities.\n\nThis transcript was created by a computer and edited by a volunteer.\n\nDave Miller: From the Gert Boyle Studio at OPB, this is Think Out Loud. I\u2019m Dave Miller. It\u2019s been more than a year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, effectively ending the constitutional right to abortion that had been in place for nearly 50 years. The decision has led to a wave of laws that restrict abortion access in about half of U.S. states. Some patients have had to cross state lines to end pregnancies that pose a risk to their health. And some doctors from states like Idaho, where performing abortions could result in imprisonment, have moved. Needless to say, it\u2019s been a tumultuous time for medical practitioners.\n\nThe most prominent professional group of OB-GYNs is called the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or ACOG. It just so happens that the incoming leader of the group is an Oregon doctor. Stella Dantas is an obstetrician and gynecologist in Hillsboro. She joins us now to talk about her profession post-Dobbs and more broadly. Welcome to the show.\n\nDr. Stella Dantas: Thank you so much for having me.\n\nMiller: And I should note for full disclosure for listeners that we\u2019ve invited you because you\u2019re the president elect of ACOG, but you happen to have delivered my children. So thank you for that.\n\nDantas: Thanks, my pleasure.\n\nMiller: I understand that you found out that you had been selected as the next president, the incoming president, this coming May of this professional organization the day before the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Can you tell us about what those two days were like for you?\n\nDantas: So it was actually the day after. The Dobbs decision fell on June 24th of 2022. I actually happened to be in Washington D.C, visiting colleges with my son and so when that decision fell, we actually went to the Supreme Court. I wanted my son to see and experience history happening. And then the next day, I did get a call that I had received the nomination as President-elect. It was a surreal 48 hours.\n\nThat week before, I think we were all preparing for this decision. I\u2019d been preparing statements for the people I lead and that at that time, it was the district part of the west coast and of what we were going to say, what we were going to be doing after and if the decision fell, but nothing prepares you for a day like that. It was heartbreaking, truly heartbreaking.\n\nMiller: How has the Dobbs decision affected the way you\u2019re thinking about your tenure that\u2019s coming up as the president of ACOG?\n\nDantas: Well, so it\u2019s a long game. My president tenure will be a year and the effects of this decision will go on for decades, unfortunately - is what I think. Optimistically, I wish it would not. Of course, we will be working on trying to achieve full access to reproductive healthcare for every person in this country. And we want to protect from legislative interference. So that will be a heavy amount of work that I will be doing during my presidency.\n\nI will also want to mention that I will be focusing also on burnout and what is happening to our specialty. Coming out of a pandemic, we have burnout and just the amount of burden right now to practice medicine and this is just the tip of the iceberg here with legislation coming in, telling us how to practice. You\u2019re seeing a patient and you\u2019re not allowed to give them the full menu of options that is evidence based for them to make decisions about their health care. It\u2019s really hard for our patients and it\u2019s also hard for the providers, the clinicians, who are taking care of them.\n\nMiller: A few months ago, researchers at the University of California-San Francisco, put out a study based on reports from OB-GYNs across the country. The title says a lot. This is the title: \u201cCare Post Roe: Documenting cases of poor quality care since the Dobbs decision.\u201d Can you give us a sense for some of the issues that came up in those cases reported by your colleagues?\n\nDantas: Yeah. Well, so some of it is delays of care. If you\u2019re practicing in a state where you can\u2019t provide an abortion in a timely manner. So you\u2019re seeing delays of care. You\u2019re seeing patients who have medical comorbidities, they have reasons where carrying a pregnancy would be deleterious to their health. They are having to travel long distances. Your counseling is affected. Our clinicians are scared of criminalization. They\u2019re scared of going to jail. They\u2019re having to balance how do I talk to my patients? How do I give them all the options without harming or putting risk to my family and myself?\n\nSo those are the stories, and then also just the fact that they have to travel. So we\u2019ve got people in states who don\u2019t have access to care they should so they\u2019re having to travel miles and miles. Now some people have the means to do that. Many people don\u2019t. So it\u2019s affecting marginalized populations more and that\u2019s very challenging and regrettable.\n\nMiller: Just to be clear, with a lot of these cases, they point out that we\u2019re not simply talking about people seeking abortion, we\u2019re talking about the serious repercussions for say, somebody who is miscarrying. How might that work?\n\nDantas: So if somebody has a miscarriage and they need care\u2013let\u2019s say that they\u2019re miscarrying in their second trimester\u2013if there is not a provider around to take care of them, to help them if they are bleeding, if there is a patient with an ectopic pregnancy, and you\u2019re in a state where that is considered illegal to take care of them until that patient is in a life threatening circumstance, the amount of trauma for that patient to have to wait to be cared for, to have their ectopic pregnancy to be taken care of until they\u2019re in a life threatening circumstance, as opposed to upstream, and the amount of complications that that can arise and then the stress and toll for their clinician\u2026so those are the types of stories that we\u2019re hearing.\n\nMiller: The New York Times had an article recently, and other outlets have done this as well, about OB-GYNs who\u2019ve left states where abortion is being outlawed. You were actually quoted in that article. How common is this right now?\n\nDantas: So we are seeing a lot of shifts of providers in certain states that would be called our red states. So for example, I personally know a couple OB-GYNs who wanted to raise their family in a rural state. They intentionally went to Idaho to practice and as the climate became untenable for them, as they were worrying again, they have young children, they can\u2019t be in jail for providing good care, they had to consider leaving. And so these clinicians are leaving for places [where] [they] have access. They\u2019re coming to places like Oregon and unfortunately, we\u2019re leaving even more maternity care deserts out there.\n\nMiller: What are the implications of that? I\u2019m also curious, obviously without naming names, what you\u2019ve heard from clinicians across the country who have made that decision. They were practicing in places that they chose. They didn\u2019t want to leave, they felt they had to.\n\nWhat have you heard from them?\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nDantas: Well, again, it\u2019s the stress of the day-to-day and the emotions. As a clinician, you go into medicine to take care of patients and you develop these relationships with patients and you know you are not providing evidence-based optimal care for them, you can\u2019t. That\u2019s a hard burden to shoulder.\n\nThey are also worried again that they don\u2019t want their kids to grow up without a mom or a father. And then also just thinking about communities. They don\u2019t want to leave their communities and now we\u2019re pulling people out of these communities.\n\nAnd so in that article, I talked about a ripple effect and there\u2019s not only a ripple effect to the care that people aren\u2019t getting, there\u2019s a ripple effect as to what we\u2019re doing to these communities. We\u2019re not just pulling out OB-GYNs, we\u2019re pulling out partners and other people. We\u2019re pulling out people that would be helping out at schools, other people in the community, ER physicians in the community. And it\u2019s hard because they don\u2019t want to leave. They don\u2019t want to do that to the people they\u2019ve cared for years, but ultimately, they have to make a decision that works best for them and their family.\n\nMiller: Oregon does not have abortion restrictions of the kind that we\u2019re talking about - really any - but we have seen a different trend over the last year or so. The planned closures of stand-alone birthing centers, one in Baker City, one in Gresham that happened and then the state didn\u2019t have investigation said no Legacy, open it back up. But it made me wonder if this is a national trend, the closure of stand-alone centers.\n\nDantas: Yes. We are seeing this in a number of states all across the country. So about 35% of counties are considered, as of 2022, maternity care deserts, meaning they have no obstetricians, they don\u2019t have care available. That number I would imagine is higher now, as we go toward the end of 2023. We are seeing birth centers close for a number of reasons, some of it may be financial, some of it maybe because they don\u2019t have enough providers to staff and then they close. And what that\u2019s doing now to our patients in those places, it\u2019s not only making it hard for them to find a place to deliver. They might have to travel 75 more miles to find a birth center or a labor and delivery unit at a hospital, but it\u2019s also affecting the care they get upstream.\n\nMiller: Last week, we talked about the country\u2019s terrible maternal and infant mortality rates. They\u2019re among the worst among industrialized rich countries, despite the fact that we spend a lot of money as a whole in this country on healthcare. And there\u2019s a lot to this. But in the big picture first, what stands out to you in these numbers?\n\nDantas: Well, in these numbers, what stands out to me is that here we are in a country where we have great care that should be available to all and it\u2019s not; it\u2019s only accessible to a few and the number is going down. And what I was talking about also is as we have these maternity care deserts, we are not making it easy for patients to get the care that we can provide in this country. So one barrier is just insurance coverage. But two again, if you have to travel, it\u2019s not just for the birth, we\u2019re not allowing people to get prenatal care so that they can optimize the health and their pregnancy to have a good outcome. And Dave you have kids. You know how many prenatal appointments there are. If you have to travel 75 miles to get care every time you go for a prenatal appointment, it\u2019s hard. People are working, they\u2019re taking time out of their schedules. If you just have to go 15 minutes to get care, it\u2019s challenging to fit in. Imagine if you have to go an hour or more to get care.\n\nMiller: From the perspective both as a clinician yourself and as the president-elect of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, how do you think about the gigantic racial disparities in those numbers, in particular among Black and African American mothers or mothers-to-be and Native American?\n\nDantas: Yes, the numbers are, unfortunately, much higher. The maternal mortality rate of a Black mother is three times higher than white women. It\u2019s because of access to care and we are also doing a lot of work on diversity, equity and inclusivity at the college and around the country. We want to make sure that we have, one, patients and all populations have access to clinicians, and also, two, clinicians that they identify with. That\u2019s extremely important, right? Because if I\u2019m saying something to you as a patient and we\u2019re not identifying with each other, it\u2019s probably much harder for you to take what I\u2019m saying and do it. It\u2019s already hard to try to do things to improve your health. So, we are trying to work on that and improve the diversity of the clinicians that are around the country.\n\nMiller: I should say we\u2019re going to be talking more deeply about Multnomah County\u2019s efforts to address some of these racial disparities in the next segment.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund put out a big report about maternal mortality a few years ago and they had a really striking chart to me. It showed the maternal care workforce in 11 different rich countries. The U.S. has fewer providers overall than all of them except for Canada, but we also have a much lower ratio of midwives to MDs, to OB-GYNs, than almost all of them. This might be sensitive because you represent OB-GYNs. I\u2019m curious if you would support increasing the rate of the use of midwives, nurse midwives or whatever, for uncomplicated pregnancies in this country. I mean, should people like you be delivering fewer babies in the U.S.?\n\nDantas: Yes. I\u2019m happy to comment on that. The American College of OB-GYN has a great relationship with the ACNM\u2026\n\nMiller: Which is?\n\nDantas: The American College of Nurse Midwives. And you may know that I have a collaborative practice with certified nurse midwives where I work. I am very supportive of having a diverse workforce and everyone working to the top of scope. Yes, we are looking at a physician shortage. And again, I was talking to you about my concern about the burnout. I think one way to help keep people in the workforce is to make sure we are all working to top a scope, finding joy in what we do and also that we have enough people to do the work so no one is overly burdened to burn out. So, yes at ACOG we support team-based care and certified nurse midwives, they provide great low risk care and they work collaboratively with obstetricians and gynecologists so that when things do turn high risk, we can be there to help and support.\n\nMiller: The cesarean rate in the U.S. is something like 33%. One in three pregnancies are through C-section. That can increase morbidity and mortality for mothers, particularly in subsequent deliveries. What do you think it would take to reduce that rate?\n\nDantas: So, one thing that would be helpful is just reducing the primary cesarean section rate.\n\nMiller: Meaning for the first birth?\n\nDantas: Right. For the first birth. And so there has been a lot of work done. In fact, the college has a program called the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health. It\u2019s called AIM. It has bundles that are being released nationally and they work in conjunction with state hospitals all around the country and one of those bundles is proven to prevent the first cesarean. So it is about making sure that we have the right personnel available, that we are watching people as they labor and giving them all the opportunities that we can so that they can have a successful and safe birth vaginally.\n\nOf course, there are times when you have to do a cesarean section for the safety of the mother, for the safety of the child, but just trying to make sure that we are practicing to the right standard all across and that we have facilities available to care. Sometimes people need rest, they may need an epidural, they may need that to get through the rest of their labor to help their body relax and move forward. So there\u2019s a lot that we are doing.\n\nMiller: Are you advocating for any changes in training in residency to make this more possible? I mean, I\u2019m thinking, for example, about giving OB-GYNs to-be more experienced with vaginal deliveries for breech presentations where the baby is, right side up, meaning the wrong way.\n\nDantas: Right. Well, as you may know with singleton breech deliveries, data came out that they were unsafe, but certainly there are patients that choose, even with the data, they want to have a singleton breech vaginal delivery meaning one baby delivering breech. And there are a smaller number of people that know how to do that in this country. I do advocate for an interdisciplinary training environment. We do this here where I practice. We have residents and medical students training and seeing how certified nurse midwives and OB-GYNs work together to provide informed care and support patients\u2019 choice in a safe way.\n\nAnd so yes, we need to have training so that we can support all of patients\u2019 choices and work together upstream so that when we get out\u2013and wherever we practice around the country because the cultures are different\u2013that we are working together.\n\nMiller: Well, Stella Dantas, thanks very much.\n\nDantas: Thank you.\n\nMiller: Stella Dantas is the president-elect of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She is an OB-GYN herself, practicing in Hillsboro.\n\nContact \u201cThink Out Loud\u00ae\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to comment on any of the topics in this show or suggest a topic of your own, please get in touch with us on Facebook, send an email to thinkoutloud@opb.org, or you can leave a voicemail for us at 503-293-1983.
