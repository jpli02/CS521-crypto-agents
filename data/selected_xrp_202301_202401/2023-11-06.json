        "content": "With each mass shooting, Americans look to one grim indicator \u2014 the number of dead \u2014 as a measure of the destructive impact. But damage left behind by gunshot wounds reverberates among survivors and families, sending mental health disorders soaring and shifting huge burdens onto the health care system, a new analysis of private health insurance claims shows.\n\nIn 2020, gunshot wounds became the leading cause of death for children and adolescents in the United States. Though the government does not systematically track nonfatal gunshot wounds, existing evidence suggests that they are two to three times as common as fatal ones. These wounds can be especially catastrophic in children, whose bodies are so small that the amount of tissue destroyed is greater.\n\n\u201cWhat comes after the gunshot is so often not talked about,\u201d said Dr. Chana Sacks, co-director of the Gun Violence Prevention Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and an author of the new study, published on Monday in the journal Health Affairs. The study, which analyzed thousands of insurance claims, maps out lasting damage to families and communities.\n\nFor families in which a child died of a gunshot wound, surviving family members experienced a sharp increase in psychiatric disorders, taking more psychiatric medications and making more visits to mental health professionals: Fathers had a 5.3-fold increase in treatment for psychiatric disorders in the year after the death; mothers had a 3.6-fold increase; and surviving siblings had a 2.3-fold increase.\n\nChildren and teenagers who survive gunshot wounds become, as Dr. Sacks put it, \u201cmore like lifelong patients.\u201d During the year after the injury, their medical costs rose by an average of $34,884, a 17-fold increase from baseline, driven by hospitalizations, emergency room visits and home health care, the study found.\n\nChildren and adolescents who survived the most severe gunshot wounds, requiring treatment in an intensive care unit, struggled considerably. In that group, diagnoses of pain disorders increased 293 percent, and psychiatric disorders increased by 321 percent.\n\nThe study examined medical records from 2,052 children who survived gunshots, 6,209 family members of children who survived, and 265 family members of children who died from gunshot wounds, comparing each with five controls. Because the study was based on private insurance claims, it did not reflect the experience of families who were uninsured or on public insurance.\n\nRising costs linked to firearms injuries make it \u201cincreasingly an economic issue,\u201d said Dr. Zirui Song, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the study. The prevalence of gunshot wounds has quadrupled over the last 12 years in the population covered by private insurance, he said."
