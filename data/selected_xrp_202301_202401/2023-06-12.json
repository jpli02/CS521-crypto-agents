        "content": "Ripple has been growing in terms of development. Despite the SEC lawsuit that has lasted for over two years, the Ripple team has exhibited expansion and growth.\n\nNow, according to the latest news updates, Ripple has partnered up with the largest university in Canada. The collaboration with the University of Toronto is to launch an independent XRP ledger validator.\n\nRipple\u2019s move is part of its UBRI\n\nAccording to the details in the press release, the collaboration is part of the University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) by Ripple in Canada. Additionally, over the past five years, the firm has invested over $2 million in many universities and colleges.\n\n\u201cThis newest UBRI partnership helps to grow a program that is already supporting important blockchain and crypto technology research in Canada while providing students with opportunities to acquire technical skills for a crypto-native career.\u201d\n\nThe University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) is an initiative launched by Ripple in 2018. Its aim is to support and collaborate with academic institutions worldwide in conducting research, developing curriculum, and fostering innovation in blockchain technology, digital payments, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nSource: Financial Times\n\nAlso read: Coinbase Receives Invite from Hong Kong Legislator Amidst Regulatory Challenges\n\nThrough UBRI, Ripple provides financial resources, technical expertise, and access to its network of industry professionals. Additionally, the team will assist universities in exploring and advancing blockchain-related topics.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting about the collaboration is that the announcement comes at a time when the SEC is scrutinizing the cryptocurrency realm."

        "content": "With the release of the controversial documents just one day away, the cryptocurrency industry continues to follow the people close to the legal battle that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is waging against blockchain company Ripple for any insights into the case.\n\nIn this context, legal expert and amicus curiae for Ripple, John E. Deaton, commented on the possible effect of the emails\u2019 public release on this case, as well as other lawsuits that the regulator has initiated against cryptocurrency businesses in the meantime, according to the tweet he posted on June 11.\n\nWhat Hinman release means\n\nAs he explained, the documents referring to a speech that former SEC Division Director William Hinman delivered at a summit in 2018, where he said that Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) were not securities, could have an even more significant effect on the public and relevant policymakers:\n\n\u201cThe emails won\u2019t change the Howey analysis, but they will likely show the difficulty in applying 1930s/40s precedent to modern-day technology. The emails will likely help Coinbase and Ripple in the Court of Public Opinion and hopefully drive bipartisan efforts in Congress.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Deaton predicted that \u201cthe emails will highlight Hinman\u2019s massive conflicts of interest\u201d and that \u201cpeople will ask: \u2018Then why give the speech?\u2019\u201d based on the conclusions he drew with the help of the crypto community in late 2022.\n\nAs a reminder, in December 2022, he rallied his followers on Twitter to try and help figure out the redacted parts of the controversial document, particularly the comments by Brett Redfern, former SEC Director of Trading and Markets, as \u201csomething that gives the SEC prosecutorial options.\u201d\n\nIndeed, most agreed that one of the phrases referred to either \u201cmarket confusion\u201d or \u201cmore speculation,\u201d indicating that Redfern had warned that the speech would cause \u201cmarket confusion\u201d or \u201cmore speculation,\u201d and Deaton more recently reiterated the question, \u201cSo why give the speech?\u201d\n\nOther issues with SEC\u2019s position\n\nOn June 11, he shared the SEC\u2019s response to his Writ of Mandamus he had filed in January 2021, in which the regulatory agency admits \u201cthat the Court decides if the SEC\u2019s claim or theory is even valid,\u201d to which Deaton added that \u201cthe SEC calling an asset a security does NOT mean it is a security.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, as the excerpt reads:\n\n\u201cThus, the Commission\u2019s enforcement proceeding in the Southern District of New York brought under the Securities Act supplies the exclusive method for testing the validity of the Commission\u2019s complaint against Ripple.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the XRP token, which is at the center of this widely publicized case, was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.51, up 1.20% in the last 24 hours but down 3.77% across the previous week, as it recorded a more notable gain of 20.12% on its monthly chart, as per data retrieved on June 12."

        "title": "XRP suggests bullishness as Ripple CEO credits the community with lawsuit win - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stood in agreement with a report that suggested that the XRP community was the most influential entity in 2023.\n\nXRP price moving sideways is most likely a sign of potential recovery on the horizon.\n\nRipple whales have been consistently accumulating for the past three weeks, adding to the probability of a rise.\n\nXRP price greatly benefitted from the partial win it attained in the lawsuit filed by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). However, Ripple\u2019s CEO decided that the credit largely goes not to himself or the company but to its supporters.\n\nDaily Digest Market Movers: Ripple CEO credits XRP army\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to X, formerly Twitter, to respond to a report by CoinDesk crowning him as one of the most influential people in 2023. The executive was less in agreement with the title than the unwavering support throughout the court proceedings. Garlinghouse tweeted,\n\n\"2023 Most Influential award should be given not just to Garlinghouse, but also the entire XRP Army.\" I couldn't agree more!\n\nThe Ripple CEO has iterated this statement in the past as well. Along with him, CTO David Schwartz has credited the XRP Army with making the court win possible.\n\nTechnical Analysis: XRP price prepares for recovery\n\nXRP price is trading at $0.622 and is presently moving sideways, building up toward a recovery that has been due since early November. The native Ripple token corrected by almost 20% at the beginning of last month, following a 31% rally toward the end of October, which XRP aims to recover going forward.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators are exhibiting potential bullish momentum. The RSI is lurking above the neutral line marked at 50.0, and the MACD is close to executing a bullish crossover.\n\nThis would mostly set the XRP price in an uptrend, targeting the breach of the $0.644 resistance level. Flipping this price into a support floor is crucial for a further rise toward $0.700.\n\nXRP/USD 1-day chart\n\nNevertheless, a failed breach would point toward a potential decline, which would send the XRP price to $0.600. Losing this support line would invalidate the bullish thesis, resulting in a crash to $0.551.\n\nRipple whales support a rally\n\nRipple whales have been adding to their wallets for the past three weeks, bringing their holding to 6.73 billion XRP. Addresses holding 100,000 XRP to 1 million XRP have noted an increase of 60 million XRP worth over $31 million since November 15.\n\nRipple whale accumulation\n\nThese addresses hold significant influence on the price action and have historically proven to be a catalyst as well. Their accumulation tends to push the XRP price upward, and the sell-off results in the value of the token declining. Thus, the fact that their present sentiment is adding instead of removing from their wallets is a positive sign for Ripple investors."

        "content": "Since co-founding The Ripple Effect in April 2022, Sam Dibley has helped secure a fast-growing client roster.\n\nWithin a month of launching, he landed the agency\u2019s first big win in Paramount Plus+, winning a brief to launch MTV Catfish UK Season 2 after a competitive pitch process.\n\nOther wins include OpenTable, Glasses Direct, The Kennel Club Charitable Trust and Kayak, as well as Gousto for a broadcast campaign.\n\nWith the belief that PR can be used for good, Dibley has promised that the agency will give away 2.5 per cent of profits to two independent charities \u2013 for year two, these are Refuge4Pets and Changing Faces.\n\nThe 29-year-old also commits to taking on at least one pro bono PR campaign annually, and recently approached George Fleming, founder of Save Our Scene UK, and secured him a primetime interview slot on Sky News.\n\nNominator says:\n\n\u201cWatch this space as Sam and The Ripple Effect continue to make waves.\u201d\n\nWhat is your proudest professional achievement?\n\nMy proudest professional achievement is co-founding The Ripple Effect with Frankie.\n\nThrough our agency, we have made a tangible difference for the brands we work with and have been able to support charitable causes by donating a portion of our profits each year. It\u2019s rewarding to see the impact we can make through our work.\n\nIn your view, how can PR employers better retain talent?\n\nPR employers can better retain talent by listening more to their employees.\n\nFlexibility is crucial in today\u2019s workplace, and trust plays a significant role in fostering a positive work environment. Understanding that employees may need time off occasionally doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are looking for other job opportunities.\n\nOffering perks and policies that empower employees and align with company values can also contribute to retention. For example, providing enrichment days where employees can learn new skills or volunteer in the community can help them feel empowered and motivated.\n\nHow do you think AI will change the PR industry?\n\nI believe AI has a place in the future of PR. While it may not be fully capable of handling complex tasks at the moment, AI can be valuable in generating names for research reports, focusing brainstorming sessions, and creating press release headlines.\n\nPR professionals should embrace the time-saving aspects that AI brings to the industry rather than fearing it as a threat to their jobs.\n\nWhich social media platform do you use more than others, and why?\n\nDuring the working day, I use Twitter the most. Twitter provides a great platform for connecting and communicating with journalists, finding case studies, and staying updated on breaking news.\n\nHowever, for personal use and sharing my photography, I post most often on Instagram. As a photographer, Instagram allows me to showcase my work and look back on memories. I also have a personal account dedicated to my two miniature dachshunds, which is loved by their fans.\n\nWhere would you be working if you weren\u2019t in comms?\n\nIf I weren\u2019t in communications, I would love to work as a music photographer or a cocktail bartender. These are two of my biggest passions outside of PR, and they would allow me to pursue my creative interests in different ways.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in five years?\n\nIn five years, I see myself continuing to do what I love in PR. I hope to further develop The Ripple Effect and make an even greater impact with the brands we work with.\n\nAdditionally, I aspire to continue pursuing my passions in photography and potentially explore opportunities within the music industry or bartending.\n\n\n\n"
