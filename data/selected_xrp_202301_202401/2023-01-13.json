        "content": "Hail The Void will release their new record Memento Mori on February 17 and is now streaming the massive new single \"Talking To The Dead.\" Complete with a morbid music video directed by Chase Fraser and Kirin Gudmundson, \"Talking To The Dead\" is going to drag you down into the dark abyss\u2026 and then probably hand you a joint.\n\n\"'Talking to the Dead' is a project that examines humanity's knowledge of the inevitable and fear of the unknown and our oftentimes inability to cope with these ideas,\" said the band. \"This song together with the rest of Memento Mori creates a conceptual experience regarding our mortality and the different ways we might perceive it.\n\n\"When comparing the filming process of 'Talking to the Dead' to our previous video for 'High and Rising' there were many similarities but also many interesting challenges that kept it feeling unique. The number one challenge we faced was the brutal weather conditions shown near the end of the video. It is not an easy task to ask a crew of people to hike into the mountains covered in 3 feet of snow let alone find four people who are willing to get fully submerged in a frozen lake in -4\u00b0 weather all in the name of art but somehow we managed and it was all worth it. We're very proud of what we created and we hope everyone enjoys it.\"\n\nPre-orders for Memento Mori are available here."

        "title": "How to get seaweed in Disney Dreamlight Valley to make fiber and rope - Gamesradar",
        "content": "Disney Dreamlight Valley seaweed is an important item for crafting and cooking, but you need to get lucky while fishing to collect some. You're probably stuck on Goofy's Mysterious Wreck quest, which tasks you with getting seven bits of rope, which is crafted from fiber, which is pulled from seaweed, and that's not even the only quest that requires the stuff. To even have a chance of catching seaweed, you need to throw your fishing lure where the fish aren't, i.e where there are no ripples. If you fancy yourself as a Disney Dreamlight Valley gourmand too, you'll also need seaweed for sushi recipes. Here's how you get Disney Dreamlight Valley seaweed using your fishing rod.\n\nHow to find seaweed in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\nThere are a couple of ways to find Disney Dreamlight Valley seaweed:\n\nFound on the floor in every area of the Valley (doesn't replenish)\n\nBy fishing anywhere but at the ripples\n\n(Image credit: Gameloft)\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley Emeralds (Image credit: Gameloft) Get valuable Emeralds in Disney Dreamlight Valley for several quests or to make some money\n\nIt's important to note that (at the time of writing) any seaweed you find on the floor will not regrow and appear later, or even the next day. So, after you've picked up these fairly limited pieces, you'll need to rely on chance through fishing in the game.\n\n\n\nIf you fish anywhere in the Valley apart from at the ripples, which always guarantees you'll get a fish - or some other creature, such as a Disney Dreamlight Valley Lobster - you will get a chance to reel in some seaweed. The game doesn't really tell you that it's possible to fish anywhere aside from the ripples, which is pretty frustrating when you're on the hunt for seaweed.\n\nHow to make fiber in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n(Image credit: Gameloft)\n\nGo to a crafting table in Disney Dreamlight Valley and you'll be able to break down one piece of seaweed into five fiber.\n\nHow to make rope in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n(Image credit: Gameloft)\n\nTo make rope in Disney Dreamlight Valley, combine eight fiber at a crafting table. This will get you a single piece of rope, so you'll need lots of fiber to create more rope.\n\nUsing seaweed to eventually make rope is just one of many crafting exercises you'll have to do in all the game's quests. Some will require you to gather Disney Dreamlight Valley Clay or Disney Dreamlight Valley Rich Soil. You can also craft snowmen and other wintry furniture items using snowballs in Disney Dreamlight Valley. You might also want to know how to upgrade your house in Disney Dreamlight Valley so you can have more storage for all your various resources."

        "content": "The projects are expected to bring more than 630 new apartments for rent across the city.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Three housing developments are scheduled to begin this year in Marion County. They will replace old, vacant buildings in Broad Ripple, Fountain Square and the near east side.\n\nThe projects are expected to bring more than 630 new apartments for rent across the city.\n\nGuilford Midtown Project: 6220 Guilford Avenue\n\nIn Broad Ripple, a developer plans to tear down the old Kroger grocery store and build a mixed-use development.\n\nThe store has been vacant since 2020 and sits right off Broad Ripple Avenue. It\u2019s also not far from IndyGo\u2019s Red line.\n\nThe proposal includes 232 apartment units and 3,820 square feet of retail and commercial space.\n\nLINK: 921 Virginia Avenue\n\nIn the heart of Fountain Square, developers are working to build a mixed-use building. It will replace the former White Castle distribution center off Virginia Avenue.\n\nThe development is called LINK and it sits right on the cultural trial. The redevelopment will create 204 apartment units and 14,000 square feet of retail. The city hopes this will be used for small businesses.\n\n\u201cThe White Castle distribution center has been in the neighborhood for a long time and has been closed for a long time. We all pretty eager to see something go in,\u201d said Dakota Pawlicki with the Fountain Square Neighborhood Association.\n\nPawlicki said he hopes the prime spot will also meet the area\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cAs more and more developers are coming to Fountain Square as a place to build housing, we want to make sure that there is affordable housing for our residents and others around the city,\u201d he said.\n\nBakery Living: 1331 E. Washington Street\n\nThe current proposal plans to replace the former Ivy Tech building off East Washington Street on the near east side.\n\nDevelopers want to create 200 apartment units for housing and activate 3,200 square feet of new retail and commercial space along IndyGo\u2019s proposed Blue Line.\n\nResponse to development plans\n\nThe Indianapolis Department of Metropolitan Development said these three sites are all near a current or future transit line, which is something the city has been pushing for.\n\nBack in 2021, the City-County Council and the Metropolitan Development Commission approved zoning changes that encourage density along transit lines.\n\n\u201cThese three projects are exemplary of what we are seeing throughout the city which is an increase in affordable and market-rate housing along our Bus Rapid Transit lines,\u201d said Scarlett Andrews, the deputy mayor of economic development for the city. \u201cI think we have seen the success of that with over 3,000 units of housing in the pipeline right now along these three bus rapid transit lines.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the council also approved $23 million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) incentives for the three projects.\n\nWith that, developers had two choices. Either they could offer affordable housing units or pay a fee to the city\u2019s Housing Trust Fund.\n\nIn this case, that fee was $750,000 to one million dollars. Both \u2018Midtown Guildford\u2019 and the \u2018LINK\u2019 projects chose that option.\n\n\u201cThey will promote the development of other affordable housing throughout the city and potentially even in the same neighborhood,\u201d Andrews said."

        "title": "Prescience 2023: Micro-influencers, social commerce and the future \u2013 Deepak Sakhuja, Ripple Links - MediaNews4U",
        "content": "In the past, Influencers were often thought of in the place of a friend or family member, whose recommendations were trusted and valued, influencing their purchase and consumption behaviour.\n\nBut recently, Google and Reprise released the results of a study that found that online content has overtaken personal recommendations in the discovery phase, with 54 percent of users preferring to find new products through online content.\n\nWith these developments, there are two channels of influencer engagements that have made a mark in 2022 and will only expand in 2023 \u2013 the utilisation of micro-influencers in influencer marketing activities and the proliferation of social commerce, spurred on by e-commerce giants: Myntra, Amazon, and Flipkart.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s driving these two popular activations.\n\nThe Advent of the Micro-Influencer\n\nA study by Harvard Business School faculty found that 80pc of consumers considered a purchase recommendation trustworthy if it came from an influencer with a small audience \u2013 a fact that numerous brands are now aware of.\n\nIn 2022, with sustained campaigns, brands such as MamaEarth, Marico and Colgate-Palmolive utilised micro-creators at scale and in 2023, these engagements are only likely to increase.\n\nThe reasons why they are extremely effective are manifold \u2013 they are less scripted; their content is less polished adding a sense of authenticity to their collaborations. Further, certain creators are extremely thoughtful and particular in the collaborations they undertake, only recommending products that they truly believe in, having invested time and effort into building a small but close-knit, highly engaged audience.\n\nPrimarily, they are utilised to add a scale and to build brand share of voice. Given their cost-effectiveness, they can be deployed to build a sense of FOMO around launches where the average user\u2019s perception is that the product launched is truly revolutionary and worthy of a try \u2013 building both awareness and consideration simultaneously.\n\nCommerce Gets Social\n\nThe space of social commerce exploded in 2022, with influencers helming live sessions and promoting them on their social media, across Instagram and YouTube as well as short-form video platforms such as Moj and Josh.\n\nInfluencers going live are able to respond to and build first-person interactions with followers, taking them through trends, styling guides and more. Currently, this form is extremely popular with fashion and beauty brands, but in 2023, brands across categories with demonstrable products are likely to begin including the format in their essential marketing endeavours.\n\nA factor driving this growth is the increased digital connectivity of T1 and T2 towns and cities. Online shopping platform Meesho has been one of the largest players in the space, utilising regional creators with a personable camera presence. These influencers take users through a plethora of affordable and stylish options making the brand seem closer and more accessible for a number of users taking their first steps in their ecommerce journey.\n\n2023 looks to be another exceptional year for influencer marketing, spurred on by the growth of these two avenues as well as a host of innovative collaboration opportunities that the evolving influencer ecosystem brings.\n\n(The author is Co-Founder, Ripple Links.)"

        "content": "Ripple says 90% of Central Banks are now actively developing their own CBDCs.\n\nWith the CBDC narrative growing by the day, the firm believes XRPLedger can provide unique advantages to Central Banks.\n\nIt is becoming no news that the majority of Central Banks around the world are working with firms like Ripple to introduce their own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\n\nWhile the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once affirmed that over 110 Central Banks are at one stage or the other in their CBDC development, blockchain payments firm, Ripple Labs Inc has revealed in its recent report tagged CBDCs: The Future of Fiat, that about 90% on Central Banks are actively involved in floating the digital version of the currency.\n\nCBDCs are not a new innovation, however, they have been generating a significant buzz since around 2020 when China went ahead with the broad-based retail testing of its Digital Yuan. Ripple has highlighted a few reasons why many of these Central Banks are embracing CBDC and one of these includes increasing payment system efficiencies.\n\nIn many of the developed countries of the world, cash payments are gradually becoming obsolete as digital forms of payment are taking the center stage. With the advent of blockchain technology, the flaws in digital payment including the high cost and slow transaction speed were exposed.\n\nRather than the days it typically takes to complete a transfer from one country to another, blockchain-based payments can take a few seconds and at most minutes. This obvious advantage has seen many users embracing the tech, posing a threat to legal tender in many countries. With a CBDC, the overall country\u2019s payment landscape can tag along with recent advances in the world.\n\nAccording to Ripple, the CBDCs will also enhance national competitiveness and the introduction of new use cases will help revamp the role of the financial institutions operating in the country as a whole.\n\nCBDCs can significantly increase financial inclusion because they can be distributed to any individual that has internet access through a computer, tablet or smartphone. pic.twitter.com/DvnzTzoXrl \u2014 Ripple (@Ripple) January 12, 2023\n\nHow Ripple Fits into the CBDC Narrative\n\nRipple has grown to become a dominant leader in the blockchain payments ecosystem and over the years, it has developed a vibrant and easy-to-adopt solution based on the XRPLedger through which Central Banks can deploy their own CBDCs.\n\nAccording to the company, its CBDC platform enables stability, security, and resilience. It boasts that Central Banks can build trust using the XRP Ledger\u2019s proven technology, enabling consistent standards, privacy, and security. The XRPLedger will also enable CBDCs to build on it to create wholesale retail products that can come in handy for banks, fintechs, and members of the public.\n\nOther notable benefits of the XRPLedger for CBDC development include interoperability and overlay services as well as helping to attain sustainability based on its energy-efficient protocol.\n\nHaving highlighted that its platform can support CBDCs and Stablecoins without hitches, Ripple has inked strategic partnerships with some Central Banks of countries including that of Bhutan to create its digital Ngultrum. The company currently competes with the likes of Mastercard and Visa, both of whom are also creating solutions that can help Central Banks in their respective CBDC development journeys."
