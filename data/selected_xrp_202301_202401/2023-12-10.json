        "title": "Tranglo collaborates with Ripple to reshape the future of cross-border payments | KrASIA - KrASIA",
        "content": "In the early 2000s, Malaysia, like various other nations, leaned on migrant workers to support its local developments. These workers often purchased foreign mobile top-ups as gifts for their loved ones back home. However, physical reload cards were often found inefficient to handle. Their cumbersome nature subsequently inspired the birth of Tranglo, an enterprise committed to providing a seamless solution for cross-border airtime payments.\n\nToday, Tranglo stands tall as one of Asia\u2019s premier cross-border payment companies, transcending its origins to offer a suite of services encompassing airtime top-ups, foreign remittances, business payments, and more. With a global footprint spanning markets such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the UAE, and the UK, Tranglo distinguishes itself by leveraging technology to expedite, economize, and secure cross-border transactions.\n\nIn a landmark development in 2021, Ripple\u2019s acquisition of a 40% stake in Tranglo marked a strategic alliance aimed at scaling enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions for cross-border payments. Ripple Payments, the manifestation of this collaboration, utilizes the digital asset XRP as a bridge currency, facilitating instant cross-border payments without the traditional pre-funding prerequisites. This innovative service eliminates the need for intermediaries, touting an ostensible 0% failure rate and introducing intriguing features, particularly in liquidity options.\n\nThe impact of Tranglo\u2019s collaboration with Ripple is already evident. For example, the Global E-Money Alliance (GEA), a social banking platform committed to financial inclusion, witnessed a paradigm shift by adopting Ripple Payments. Abandoning the need for pre-funding, GEA experienced a remarkable 70% growth in transactions within three months, connecting over 300 million consumers and facilitating transactions totaling USD 1 billion.\n\nLeveraging the advantages of Ripple Payments and distributed ledger technology (DLT), Tranglo aims to enhance business liquidity and streamline payments across diverse regions. The company prioritizes flexibility, allowing businesses to employ their preferred payout methods.\n\nFurthermore, Tranglo Connect, the company\u2019s proprietary cross-border payments solution, has grown in scale, empowering businesses to execute instant and secure payments to over 70 countries. This expansion aligns seamlessly with Tranglo\u2019s overarching commitment to fostering financial inclusion."

        "content": "Recently, comedian and conspiracy theorist Owen Benjamin sparked a heated discussion by labeling Bitcoin (BTC) as a \u201cdecentralized Ponzi scheme.\u201d This assertion has prompted responses from various figures in the crypto space, including Ripple CTO David Schwartz, adding complexity to the ongoing debate.\n\nBitcoin: a Decentralized Currency or Ponzi Scheme?\n\nOwen Benjamin\u2019s argument revolves around the idea that Bitcoin operates more like a decentralized Ponzi scheme than a decentralized currency. He contends that people are not spending Bitcoin because they hope its value will rise, comparing it to a \u201chot potato\u201d that individuals are reluctant to part with.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBenjamin suggests that assets like silver, gold, and land, which possess inherent beauty, utility, and value, are more reliable stores of wealth. He further claims that Bitcoin lacks an identifiable individual attached to it, which would be essential in a traditional Ponzi scheme, giving the media control over price swings for profit.\n\nMarkedly, Saifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard, offered a counterpoint to Benjamin\u2019s perspective. Ammous argued that the success of the dollar despite inflation demonstrates that people are willing to use a currency with a decreasing value. He attributes Bitcoin\u2019s popularity to its scarcity, making it a superior store of value compared to fiat currencies.\n\nRipple CTO David Schwartz chimed in, questioning whether people truly understand the impact of anticipating a declining dollar value on spending behavior. Schwartz pointed out the potential disincentive for sellers if they know they will receive dollars that are expected to lose value.\n\nThis sparked a sophisticated debate among followers, with some questioning the necessity of inflation for economic development and others highlighting the psychological influence of a declining currency on spending.\n\nBitcoin Regulation and Skepticism\n\nAs the debate on the nature of Bitcoin unfolds, it\u2019s essential to consider the broader regulatory ecosystem. In May, Ireland\u2019s Central Bank governor, Gabriel Makhlouf, categorized Bitcoin and other unbacked cryptocurrencies as \u201cPonzi schemes,\u201d urging skepticism.\n\nHe hinted at potential regulatory actions against crypto influencers who promote digital assets without disclosing their financial interests.\n\nOverall, the question of whether Bitcoin is a decentralized Ponzi scheme or a legitimate decentralized currency remains a subject of intense debate. As various voices contribute to the conversation, the crypto space continues to evolve, challenging traditional notions of value, utility, and economic principles."

        "content": "By Khyathi Dalal\n\nRipple upgraded its payments platform to expand business interests in the U.S. and Africa.\n\nIndustry titans BlackRock, DTCC, OCC, State Street, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Hedera, Citi, BMO, Northern Trust, Citibank, Amazon, S&P Global, Google, Invesco, and Moody\u2019s will join our Nov. 13 Fintech Deal Day and Nov. 14 Future of Digital Assets . Secure a spot here to join them.\n\nWhat Happened: The crypto payments firm is looking to expand its business interests in both the U.S. and Africa through the launch of an updated settlements platform, named Ripple Payments, The Block reported. It targets a new brand of corporate clients in the U.S. with its cross-border payments solutions.\n\nInitially available in the U.S., the new Ripple Payments platform plans to expand to more places in 2024. Currently, Ripple serves customers in more than 50 countries.\n\nThe company also announced a partnership with African fintech MFS Africa, recently name changed to Onafriq, for focusing on facilitating cross-border crypto payments between Africa and other markets including the UK, Australia, and Gulf Cooperation Council.

The firm\u2019s new payments product is the result of Ripple\u2019s acquisition of 30 money transmitter licenses in the U.S.\n\nThe topic will be of discussion at Zenger News\u2019s Future Of Digital Assets Event in New York scheduled on Nov.14. Attend and learn more about Ripple and its payments platform. The gathering is seen as pivotal for the digital assets\u2019 community. The event will spotlight the latest trends, innovations, and challenges in the digital asset realm.\n\nThe new platform is expected to improve companies\u2019 ability to complete cross-border payments to suppliers, vendors, or overseas employees more effectively.\n\n\u201cConnecting our partners PayAngel, Pyppl, and Zazi Transfer with Onafriq over Ripple Payments will bring the benefits of faster and more cost-effective cross-border payments to individuals seeking to send money into Africa from around the globe,\u201d Ripple SVP Aaron Sears commented.\n\nXRP token price has rallied 37% in the past month\u2019s trading session.\n\nRipple recently received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority, and investment in a CBDC project with the National Bank of Georgia . Among licenses, it also has money transmitter licenses in the U.S. and an institutional payments license in Singapore. Recently, it has filed in the U.K. and EU.\n\nSource: Published without changes from Zenger News"

        "title": "Ripples In The Water | News, Sports, Jobs - Jamestown Post Journal",
        "content": "I have always been fascinated by ripples in the water. As a child, I loved to throw pebbles in puddles and ponds and watch the patterns created by the ripples as they overlapped. The surface became an ever-changing kaleidoscope of shapes as the ripples bounced off the edges of the puddle and criss-crossed in an organized chaos of mini-waves. It was simply mesmerizing.\n\nI sometimes wish I could conjure up that time again. It was a simpler era when I had all the time in the world to stop and watch the ripples in a puddle. There was no agenda, no worries, and no responsibility. It is a space that I feel should be created for all children, a space where they can simply explore the world in irrelevant and frivolous ways just to see how things respond.\n\nAs an adult, ripples in the water mean there is a mystery to solve. What made the ripples? Is it big or small? Does it come up for air or accidentally stir the surface? If it comes up for air, where will it come up? Can I find it? Ripples represent an almost unlimited potential of interesting things happening, even if there is nothing else to see.\n\nJust think of the possibilities! Is it a River Otter diving under the water to find a fish or a frog? Is it a fish or a frog? My daughter and I saw a December-active frog just last week. Could it be a beaver, diving under the water and disappearing into a well-hidden hole on the edge of the pond or a lodge that is just out of sight? Was it a muskrat or perhaps a kingfisher? Kingfishers are Blue Jay-sized birds that dive into the water and grab fish to eat, bashing them over and over on a branch till they stop moving. Perhaps it was a small ripple caused by an insect swimming to the surface for a moment.\n\nRipples are the sign of a larger story happening under the water, a story that may start and end with a mystery of ripples or expand into a larger tale of animals living their usually hidden lives in the water. The thing is, you never know what will happen unless you pause and watch.\n\nLast week, I was gathering rose hips to decorate wreaths for Audubon\u2019s wreath sale. Rose hips resemble small red berries perched at the end of rose bushes. It might be better to say I was tangled in the grip of a thorny cluster of roses while attempting to gather red rose hips. Regardless, I was on the edge of a pond when I heard a splash. I looked out and saw ripples in the water. Whatever it was, it made a lot of ripples.\n\nHaving nothing better to do than struggle out of the roses, I watched the pond. I lose track of time easily when I am waiting for something to happen. Seconds can pass like minutes and a moment can seem like forever. At the same time, I know that being still and patient can lead to great rewards, so minutes can also pass like seconds. It is a quandary, time flies and creeps at the same time in anticipation that something great may happen, but probably won\u2019t.\n\nOn this thorny afternoon, a beaver poked its head out of the water twenty feet from where the ripples were peacefully spreading. The beaver peacefully swam in circles for several minutes while I watched from the privacy of my rose bush. Time again stood still. Was it seconds, minutes or hours as I watched? I\u2019m not sure, but I enjoyed watching the beaver swim so close to me.\n\nOn this occasion, I was lucky enough to see what caused the ripples. Many times, nothing else happens. I think that sometimes life is more about the anticipation and endless possibilities of what is happening than actually finding out. Sometimes, ripples on the pond are only that, with nothing more to find. Other times, there is a five-minute-long peek into the life of an animal that feels like a lifetime. Part of the joy of the ripples is that you never know which is going to happen.\n\nAudubon Community Nature Center builds and nurtures connections between people and nature. ACNC is located just east of Route 62 between Warren and Jamestown. The trails are open from dawn to dusk and birds of prey can be viewed anytime the trails are open. The Nature Center is open from 10 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. daily except Sunday when it opens at 1 p.m. More information can be found online at auduboncnc.org or by calling (716) 569-2345."
