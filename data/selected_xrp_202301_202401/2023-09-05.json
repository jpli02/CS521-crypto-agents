        "title": "Ripple re-locks 800 million XRP of this month's tokens unlock - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "One billion XRP was unlocked on September 1 from Ripple\u2019s escrow system, which has been used by the controlling company to put new tokens into circulation since 2017. However, as also happens every month, Ripple only kept a fraction of September\u2019s tokens unlocked, to be sold to the market at the team\u2019s will.\n\nNotably, 800 million XRP ($400 million) were re-locked into two different escrows, accounting for 80% of the unlocked total. This means that Ripple only kept 200 million XRP ($100 million) for itself, which can be deployed to the market at any moment, possibly impacting the token\u2019s price short term.\n\nAccording to data retrieved by Finbold from the Whale Alert (@whale_alert) account on X and from XRP Scan, the 1 billion XRP was unlocked by two Ripple known accounts (Ripple 22 and Ripple 23) in four different transactions.\n\n200 million was sent from Ripple 22 to Ripple 1, which remains liquid to be spent by the team. 300 million was sent from Ripple 22 to Ripple 10, locked in an escrow programed to end by February 2027.\n\nFrom Ripple 23, the whole 500 million unlocked were directly sent to Ripple 11, to be re-locked in a new escrow programed to reach finality by January 2027.\n\nMonthly escrow Ripple (XRP) | September 2023. Source: XRP Scan (Vini Barbosa @ Finbold)\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, XRP is trading at $0.50, by press time. Registering 1.7% losses since the 1 billion tokens unlock on September 1.\n\nXRP 1-week price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn a demonstration of how the token unlocks could affect the price for the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a circulating supply of around 52.977 billion XRP, one XRP would be worth close to $2.48, if it reaches its all-time high market cap. Which is 27% less than XRP\u2019s all-time high price in US dollars from 2018.\n\nInterestingly, the 200 million new XRP being put into circulation this month accounts for 0.37% of the token\u2019s circulating supply. If Ripple only kept the same amount every month, this would mean a yearly inflation of around 4.4% for XRP holders.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Will Shiba Inu (SHIB) Overtake Ripple (XRP)? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "While predicting the future of specific cryptocurrencies is not an exact science, market analysts often consider several aspects, including past performance, use cases, community participation, and broader market volatility.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s examine whether Shiba Inu (SHIB) has the potential to outperform Ripple (XRP) in the future.\n\nFor this particular question, though, we asked none other than ChatGPT.\n\nSHIB v. XRP\n\nLooking at their market caps, with a current valuation of $26.5 billion, XRP is six times bigger than SHIB, which has a market capitalization of $4.4 billion. Since its inception, XRP has consistently been among the top crypto assets in the market cap. On the other hand, SHIB has experienced several ups and downs, with the market buffeting the meme coin far more regularly than it did XRP.\n\nHowever, SHIB is transforming itself beyond merely being a meme coin. It is the center point of a growing ecosystem that includes ShibaSwap, the Shiboshi NFTs, the Shiba Inu incubator, and the recently launched Shibarium Layer-2 network. An expanding ecosystem means that SHIB use cases will grow and push the coin\u2019s value in the future.\n\nBad publicity is usually detrimental to a coin\u2019s value, and SHIB\u2019s lackluster performance in the wake of Shibarium\u2019s glitch-laden launch is a testament to that. But with Shibarium back online and with user numbers gradually growing, analysts expect the meme coin to shake off its lethargy and start making gains.\n\nXRP has also been in the news for all the right reasons after gaining a partial victory over the SEC, where a court determined that XRP was not a security if sold on secondary markets. While the clarification hasn\u2019t really led to as big a pump in XRP prices as market watchers had expected, the expected passing of several crypto-related bills by Congress this fall may nudge its price upwards.\n\nCommunity is Detrimental\n\nFinally, in terms of community, Shiba Inu can rely on a strong, dedicated \u201cSHIB army\u201d to push the token forward. Community support has been one of Shiba Inu\u2019s most significant price drivers, and analysts expect the trend to continue.\n\nLooking at their current market values, SHIB will need to grow by as much as 550% to get anywhere near XRP\u2019s level. The meme coin would eliminate one leading zero to trade at approximately $0.0000075 in such a scenario. It might be improbable, but it\u2019s not impossible."

        "title": "Ripple (XRP) to $1 in 2023? Possible But Under These Conditions - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "XRP\u2019s price has been the subject of massive speculation throughout the past months, especially in light of the most recent developments in Ripple\u2019s case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAs it\u2019s clearly seen in the above chat, XRP\u2019s price has actually declined throughout the past three months, making the pump following the ruling of Judge Analisa Torres look like a deviation.\n\nHowever, this has had many analysts and speculators discuss the prospects of XRP reaching the coveted $1 in 2023. While the prospect of such an increase is currently looking slim, ChatGPT outlined a few conditions that could direct its price in a positive direction.\n\nThe Market Matters\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is known for the fact that whatever Bitcoin\u2019s price does, altcoins tend to follow. ChatGPT confirms this by stating that \u201cpositive sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market can attract more investors, potentially driving up demand and price.\u201d\n\nTo that, however, the AI-based chatbot also noted:\n\nEconomic events, such as inflation, currency devaluation, or geopolitical tensions, could drive individuals and institutions to seek alternative stores of value, potentially benefiting cryptocurrencies like XRP.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that market awareness might play a huge role in XRP\u2019s future price in 2023. ChatGPT said that increased adoption of XRP for various use cases could contribute to its price appreciation.\n\nBut there\u2019s clearly something hampering XRP\u2019s current adoption.\n\nRegulatory Clarity and the Ripple v. SEC Case\n\nThe case between Ripple Labs and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been going on since 2020, and it has obviously had its impact on the cryptocurrency.\n\nCryptoPotato recently reported on the multiple ways the legal battle has hurt XRP\u2019s adoption rates, as explained by a well-known pro-XRP lawyer, John E. Deaton.\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nRegulatory developments and clarity regarding the legal status of XRP can have a significant impact on its price. Favorable regulations may boost investor confidence and increase adoption.\n\nAlthough unlikely in that timeframe, a definitive victory for Ripple in its case against the SEC could catapult XRP\u2019s price just like the ruling of Judge Torres did earlier in July. However, if the case is finally settled, this might alleviate a lot of the concerns that institutional investors might currently have when it comes to XRP\u2019s legal status.\n\nOf course, please remember that none of the above is financial advice, and readers are advised to consult a professional before making any investment decisions that may or may not be related to the content on this page."

        "title": "From Remittances to Retail: Why Ripple Believes CBDCs Will Change Global Payments - PYMNTS.com",
        "content": "As currency becomes increasingly digitized, more end users are able to reap its benefits, in turn feeding an underlying network effect of increased market participants and inclusion.\n\n\u201cThere are many technical benefits you have with a digital currency that you just can\u2019t do with traditional money,\u201d James Wallis, vice president of central bank engagement at enterprise crypto solutions provider Ripple , told PYMNTS. \u201cThings can move more quickly, with more certainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have the ability to do what I would call the \u2018last mile,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIf you want to send something across border to a relative in another country, you have to go sign up with a payment provider or bank, use their mechanism [to conduct the payment], and then another payout mechanism at the end (the last mile).\u201d\n\nDigital currencies make that process much simpler and more effective by reducing unnecessary intermediaries.\n\nAnd as the world increasingly embraces digital transactions, the notion of a sovereign digital currency has gained traction, with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in particular emerging as a promising solution to legacy payment bottlenecks and frictions across both retail and cross-border payments.\n\nWallis explains that underlying the attraction is the fact that CBDCs enable pure, peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, cutting out risks and allowing for quicker transactions \u2014 making them well-suited for cross-border remittances, as they can significantly streamline the process.\n\nAdditionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, which underpins CBDCs, provides a compelling balance between the much-needed security and trust of central banks and the innovative advantages and synergies of decentralization.\n\n\u201cOne of the absolute key reasons to do blockchain is the ability to add additional functions and capabilities, relatively easily, on top of the core infrastructure\u2026 The list is almost as big as the imagination,\u201d Wallis said. \u201cIt allows the private sector to really get in and start adding more use cases.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to allow a third party to add capability to your private system, it\u2019s really hard technically to do that with a traditional system,\u201d he added.\n\nThe World Is Moving Toward a Digital Future\n\nAs alternative payment vehicles continue to ride the wave of digitization, solutions like CBDCs and the Ripple CBDC Platform are transforming the retail and cross-border payments landscape by providing a secure and efficient method that can work in tandem with traditional systems.\n\nBut the spear tip of innovation, no matter how groundbreaking, is ill-advised to make a clean break from preexisting systems.\n\n\u201cA retail CBDC has to interoperate with the existing world and existing payment schemes,\u201d Wallis said. \u201cIf you want to go and buy coffee, the merchant has to be able to accept the CBDC the same way as if you went in to pay with cash or with a credit card. \u2026 You\u2019ve got the old world and the new world sort of coming together.\u201d\n\nInteroperability is a crucial factor for the success of retail CBDCs, particularly within cross-border transactions.\n\n\u201cIf you have one organization or one country using one protocol and another one using a different protocol, to what level can you actually move assets from one ledger to another?\u201d Wallis asked. \u201cAt the end of the day, [CBDC] adoption will be based upon how useful it is.\u201d\n\nAnd the technology behind a digital currency must be fast, efficient and cost-effective, supporting local policy and allowing for creation and distribution in a seamless manner.\n\n\u201cEach CBDC use case has to offer something that\u2019s better than the way things happen today,\u201d Wallis said. \u201cFor example, I would use a CBDC rather than cash or something else because it is faster. Or for a cross-border payment because it is less expensive \u2026 In some markets, a 10-20% fee from one country to another for remittances is not unheard of. But with CBDCs, it could be a fraction of a percent, and then the volume will go up \u2014 there will be more volume, but a lower fee per transaction.\u201d\n\nThe Potential for Innovation is Immense\n\nWallis explained that the number of people using CBDCs, the volume of transactions, and the number of use cases are three crucial growth flywheels required for any payment vehicle to scale.\n\n\u201cThe bottleneck there really goes back to this question of how each use case can offer some value. It needs to be faster, or cheaper, or you can do something that you couldn\u2019t do before,\u201d he said. \u201cThe basic tenets of payment success are speed, low cost, security, certainty and a great user experience.\n\n\u201cCross-border has always been the highest friction, highest cost of any form of payments. So the benefits there, I think, are going to be greater than you would see domestically,\u201d he said.\n\nThe way Wallis envisions the future of retail CBDCs playing out, there will be \u201cmultiple networks sort of stitched together. That gets you to massive scalability, you know, way, way beyond anything that anyone can see today, as well as gives you more redundancy in the system.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an ecosystem of different participants and players, where the central bank is obviously the catalyst,\u201d he added.\n\nAs for what Wallis thinks the future holds?\n\n\u201cI think there will be thousands of different use cases that leverage a digital currency like a CBDC,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen without collaboration between the public sector and the private sector. \u2026 But cross-border payments, financial inclusion and remittances are all within reach to make significant improvements.\u201d"

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Possible moves as BTC goes back to consolidation mode - FXStreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price is back to consolidation after the recent Grayscale-infused data provided market impales. Ethereum (ETH) price is following in a path almost similar to BTC, but Ripple (XRP) price would not yield.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price likely to fall 10% from current levels this September, crypto analyst says\n\nCryptocurrency metrics FAQs What is circulating supply? The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. Since its inception, a total of 19,445,656 BTCs have been mined, which is the circulating supply of Bitcoin. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains. What is market capitalization? Market capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset\u2019s current market value. For Bitcoin, the market capitalization at the beginning of August 2023 is above $570 billion, which is the result of the more than 19 million BTC in circulation multiplied by the Bitcoin price around $29,600. What is trading volume? Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency. What is funding rate? Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.\n\nBitcoin price back to consolidation\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has fallen back to its longstanding range bound movement, coiling up around the $25,824 level. Two outcomes are likely after such a move, a break north or south. Currently, the odds favor the downside and BTC could draw nearer to the $24,995 support level and extend the losses to the psychological $24,000.\n\nIn the dire case, Bitcoin price could dip into the demand zone between $21,711 and $20,155. This outlook draws inspiration from the Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently declining to show falling momentum. Similarly, the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator flash red to suggest a presence of bears in the market.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a renaissance by the bulls could alter the impending fate for Bitcoin price, with a possible foray back above the psychological $28,000, level last tested on August 29. Increased buyer momentum could send the flagship crypto past the $29,692 barricade, or in a highly bullish case, shatter the $31,518 obstacle.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin investors expect more downside, Vitalik Buterin sells his MKR holdings\n\nEthereum price tests $1,630 support level\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is barely holding above the $1,630 support level, even as BTC shows weakness. Increased seller momentum could send the price lower, potentially breaching the $1,522 support level. A decisive flip of this buyer congestion level into resistance would solidify the downtrend for the short term and mark a 5% landslide.\n\nLike BTC, the momentum indicators point to a similar outcome as momentum is steadily declining and the RSI could soon activate a signal to sell ETH when it crosses below the signal line (yellow band). Traders heeding this call would bode poorly for ETH.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, late or sidelined investors could salvage Ethereum price from the impending slump, with a possible move above the $1,701 resistance level. Increased buying pressure from this level could see ETH ascend to confront the mid-August highs around $1,835, or in the highly ambitious cases, attempt to break from current gloom by making a strong reach above $2,008.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Cancun upgrade development is on track, testing phase comes next\n\nRipple price goes AWOL\n\nRipple (XRP) price is nurturing a uptrend that could materialize if early profit takers keep their profit appetite in check. The token boasts three successive green candlesticks, pointing to bulls gaining ground.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could sustain the uptrend, sending Ripple price above the immediate hurdle at $0.5667, which stands as multi-month resistance level barring two equal highs and therefore significant.\n\nHigher, Ripple price would have a shot at reclaiming the ground lost after the July 13 ascent, first breaching the $0.6840 level before taking back control with a solid move above the $0.8193 resistance level.\n\nNoteworthy the RSI had executed a bullish crossover, moving above the signal line in an attempt to siren a buy signal. Traders harkening to this call could enhance the uptrend for Ripple price. The AO makes the bullish outlook stronger, with the histogram bars soaking in green and edging toward the midline. This adds credence to the bullish outlook.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other side, early profit takers from XRP holders who are incurring losses at current price or breaking even and looking for early exits to escape losses could sell the remittance token, so much so that the demand zone between $0.5040 and $0.4600 fails to hold as support. A decisive break below the mean threshold (midline of demand zone marked in blue) would invalidate the bullish thesis, exposing XRP to an extrapolated slump toward the $0.4191 support level.\n\n\n\nBreaking: Ripple files opposition to SEC\u2019s motion to certify interlocutory appeal"
