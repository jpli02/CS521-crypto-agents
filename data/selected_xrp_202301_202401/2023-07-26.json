        "content": "A new kind of scam has begun to spread on X, formerly known as Twitter, this time involving accounts spoofing the identity of David Schwartz, one of the architects of XRPL, current CTO at Ripple, and an extremely popular community member.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the scamming method is not new, with fake accounts filling every possible media space with a ton of tweets about giving away hundreds of millions of XRP by clicking on a \"magic\" link. However, in the past, scammers used the identity of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse for their purposes. Now they seem to have switched to Schwartz.\n\nIt is likely that a sophisticated Crypto Twitter user, as well as a longtime member of the XRP community, is unlikely to fall for such an uncomplicated scam. Nevertheless, XRP has been the number one topic in the industry for the past two weeks and is obviously attracting newbies and not-so-experienced investors, who cannot help but jump in to see what the 100 million XRP giveaway is all about.\n\nFailed war on bots\n\nIn general, the problem with scam bots on Twitter, and now X, has existed for a long time, and the war against them, declared by Elon Musk back when he first became the owner of the social network, seems to be unsuccessful."

        "content": "NGERULMUD, Palau & SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Republic of Palau and Ripple have launched a limited stablecoin pilot. Palau and Ripple, the leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, started collaborating on exploring potential use cases in 2021. The U.S. Dollar-backed Palau Stablecoin (PSC) will be issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a carbon-neutral blockchain that has been used to transact millions of transactions over the course of 10 years, enabling privacy and security for settlement and liquidity of tokenized assets. The pilot program will roll out in phases, with the first phase involving participation from about 200 government employees and local merchants in Palau.\n\nAs part of this controlled stablecoin pilot, Palau will also leverage the Ripple CBDC Platform, an end-to-end solution for central banks to issue their own central bank digital currency, as well as the technical resources to make the PSC a digital representation of Palau\u2019s official currency, the U.S. Dollar. The enhanced platform will now allow Palau to holistically manage and customize the entire life cycle of the stablecoin, including distribution and transactions. A stablecoin is a digital unit produced on a blockchain that maintains a fixed value.\n\nIn this case, each PSC would be valued at one U.S. Dollar guaranteed by a 1:1 reserve in fiat currency and issued on the XRPL. The operational model follows other reserve-backed private stablecoins, such as USDC or USDT, with a notable difference for the PSC with the involvement of the Republic of Palau\u2019s Ministry of Finance (MOF). The MOF will supervise the system and trigger the issuance and redemption of stablecoin units, while always guaranteeing the 1:1 reserve.\n\n\u201cBy digitizing our currency, we hope to mobilize our economy and government processes to improve financial transactions and empower our citizens. As a smaller country, Palau has the advantage to be innovative and nimble in releasing our stablecoin,\u201d said President of the Republic of Palau, Surangel S. Whipps, Jr. \u201cWe trust in Ripple\u2019s long-standing expertise in CBDCs and blockchain technology, as well as the carbon-neutral XRP Ledger to help create our national digital currency that will offer our citizens greater financial success,\u201d the President added.\n\n\u201cRipple is honored to work with the Republic of Palau on implementing their stablecoin to help Palau accelerate their business growth by providing a single source for producing and managing digital currency,\u201d said James Wallis, VP of Central Bank Engagements for Ripple. \u201cPalau is a Pacific Island nation comprising over 200 volcanic and coral islands, filled with unique wildlife and vegetation. Launching the Palau Stablecoin will help the island reduce their carbon footprint and their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.\u201d\n\nDuring Phase One of the pilot program, Palau government employees who volunteered for the program will receive an allotment of PSC to be used for the pilot.\n\nThe Palau Stablecoin (PSC) will bring many advantages to its citizens, merchants and the government. These benefits include greater financial inclusion and reduced overall transaction fees for citizens. The PSC will also help reduce their currency costs, while considerably accelerating the speed of transactions.\n\nTo instill confidence for Palau citizens that the PSC is a secure and effective monetary tool that can support commercial activity in Palau, success criteria of Phase One of the controlled pilot should achieve the following:\n\nThe Palau Ministry of Finance (MOF) are able to securely and reliably mint, distribute, and process inbound redemptions, and destroy PSC with full control over total circulation on a 24/7 real-time basis.\n\nPalau government employees are able to make purchases for goods and services at select retailers using the transfer of PSC at the point-of-sale as a means of payment.\n\nPalau retailers are able to safely and securely receive & verify payments made by individuals using the PSC, and are able to convert the received PSC to funds in their local bank account.\n\nFollowing the success of Phase One of the pilot program, additional phases of the Palau stablecoin will be rolled out later in the year. To learn more about the Palau Stablecoin Project, refer to the FAQs posted online: https://www.palaugov.pw/wp-content/uploads/PALAU-STABLECOIN-FAQs-2.17.23.pdf.\n\nAbout the Republic of Palau\u2019s Ministry of Finance\n\nThe Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Palau\u2019s vision is to be widely recognized for sound financial management services that encourage accountability, continuous productivity of government services, and economic growth. The Ministry\u2019s mission is to ensure accountability, continuous productivity of government services, and economic growth by promoting policies for, and sound management of, expenditures, revenues, financing, and human resources. Ultimately, the Ministry of Finance aims to serve the Republic of Palau with integrity and character with zero tolerance for fraud or corruption.\n\nAbout Ripple\n\nRipple is the leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, transforming how the world moves, manages and tokenizes value. Ripple\u2019s business solutions are faster, more transparent, and more cost effective - solving inefficiencies that have long defined the status quo.
