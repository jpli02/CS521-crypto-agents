        "content": "As to opioid harm reduction, Medford School District is highlighting its proactive approach to overdose deaths across all its campuses.\n\nAccording to the Medford School District, the district began installing multiple Opioid Emergency Kits in its schools last summer and now every campus has at least one kit installed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always tragic to have an overdose but it\u2019s also a different degree of tragic when you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re potentially even taking this drug,\u201d said Ron Havniear, Executive Director of Safety and Security at MSD. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that Narcan, also known as \u201d\n\nNaloxone is a drug that rapidly reverses an opioid overdose and in many cases is administered through a nasal spray, like Narcan which is what Medford School District has on hand.\n\n\n\nAccording to the , Naloxone is considered a \u201csafe medicine\u201d meaning it only takes effect on someone who has opioids in their system. Havniear says because it\u2019s safe, someone can administer the drug even if they aren\u2019t entirely sure a student or faculty member is experiencing an overdose.\n\nSigns of an opioid overdose include unconsciousness, small pupils, shallow breathing, vomiting, faint heartbeat, pale skin, limp limbs, and purple lips and fingernails.\n\nHavniear says the district implementing Opioid Emergency Kits in its schools isn\u2019t a result of overdoses in school on what the schools have seen happening in the community.\n\n\u201cOur kids live in this community and we have that they\u2019re exposed to and obviously that stuff spills over into our schools,\u201d Havniear said.\n\nHe says they try their best to sweep every campus before school starts, specifically in places like the parking lots and playgrounds in the event dangerous pills get dropped or left behind.\n\nMedford School District began last summer which includes principals, assistant principals, office staff, and security. That\u2019s in addition to the district nurses and school resource officers who are already trained in life-saving measures.\n\nAccording to the district, these are the steps that should be taken if a student or teacher sees someone overdosing:\n\nCall 911\n\nLocate an Opioid emergency Kit and staff member (both are located together)\n\nTake the nasal spray, insert it into either nostril, and depress the plunger\n\nIn the event the person experiences another overdose within the next few minutes, administer another dose of naloxone\n\n\u201cWe want to have this stuff be close enough on campus so we\u2019re not waiting longer than a couple minutes to get it,\u201d Havniear said.\n\nMedford School District now gets all its Narcan through the Oregon Health Authority. According to Havniear, they initially tried through the OHA and hospitals but it was easily available so they then acquired doses through a nonprofit organization.\n\nNow, thanks to greater access to harm-reduction services, OHA can provide public entities like schools with naloxone. Havniear says all they have to do is submit a form to OHA, specify which campuses they need the kits on and OHA will deliver the overdose-reversing drug."

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs the fallout from the stunning collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) plays out, numerous crypto companies have signaled their exposure to the bank, which long maintained a reputation as one of the most prominent lenders to tech startups in the world.\n\nThe bank\u2019s closure Friday by the California Department of Financial Protection marked the second-largest bank failure in American history, after the undoing of Washington Mutual during the financial crisis of 2008. Silicon Valley Bank reported $212 billion in assets last quarter.\n\nThe stock (SIVB) began spiraling late Wednesday after rumors circulated that the institution was seeking an acquisition after failing to raise sufficient capital to cover its obligations. In the hours and days that followed, numerous venture capital funds reportedly advised their clients to withdraw their funds, resulting in $42 billion of withdrawals initiated on Thursday, constituting a run on the bank. On Friday morning, the Nasdaq halted trading of SIVB shares.\n\nThough it was venture capital firms and tech startups that were most severely affected by the SVB scare on Friday, numerous crypto companies have also disclosed their exposure to the bank. Here\u2019s a running list of the crypto firms caught in the crosshairs of SVB's collapse, along with those that have publicly claimed they avoided the damage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNote: On Sunday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chairman Martin Gruenberg issued a joint statement saying that all Silicon Valley Bank depositors would be made whole and have access to their funds on Monday, March 13. The Federal Reserve is now investigating the bank's failure.\n\nCrypto companies that had money in SVB\n\nRipple\n\nOn Sunday night, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse tweeted that Ripple \"had some exposure to SVB\u2014it was a banking partner, and had some of our cash balance.\"\n\nDespite this, Garlinghouse asserted that Ripple expects \"no disruption to our day-to-day business\" and that the company \"remains in a strong financial position.\"\n\nSetting the record straight on SVB Qs: Ripple had some exposure to SVB \u2013 it was a banking partner, and held some of our cash balance. Fortunately, we expect NO disruption to our day-to-day business, and already held a majority of our USD w/ a broader network of bank partners. \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) March 12, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlockFi\n\nFailed crypto lender BlockFi, which filed for bankruptcy in November in the wake of FTX's collapse, has $227 million in funds held at SVB, according to documents filed Friday related to BlockFi's bankruptcy proceedings. Those funds are reportedly not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) as they are in a money market mutual fund, which itself may constitute a violation of bankruptcy law.\n\nBlockFi first halted withdrawals just days after the implosion of crypto exchange FTX. The lender had previously been bailed out by FTX with a revolving $250 million line of credit, last June.\n\nPer new bankruptcy filing, BlockFi has $227m in Silicon Valley Bank. The bankruptcy trustee warned them on Mon that bc those funds are in a money market mutual fund, they\u2019re not FDIC secured \u2014 which could be a prblm w/ keeping in compliance of bankruptcy law pic.twitter.com/hnpo8anrrS \u2014 Lauren Hirsch (@LaurenSHirsch) March 10, 2023\n\nCircle\n\nCircle, issuer of the world's second-largest stablecoin USDC, announced on Friday that some undisclosed portion of the cash reserves used to back USDC and tie its value to the US dollar were held at Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nThe company said in a statement Friday that SVB was one of six banks relied on to manage USDC's cash reserves, but claims USDC will be able to continue operating normally.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank is one of six banking partners Circle uses for managing the ~25% portion of USDC reserves held in cash. While we await clarity on how the FDIC receivership of SVB will impact its depositors, Circle & USDC continue to operate normally.https://t.co/NU82jnajjY \u2014 Circle (@circle) March 10, 2023\n\nStablecoins like USDC are cryptocurrencies backed by and pegged to the value of real-world assets. They are meant to serve as a sturdy intermediary between traditional finance and more volatile crypto markets; USDC, with a market capitalization of $42.17 billion, is the second-most used stablecoin in the world. 25% of the assets backing USDC, which purports to be fully collateralized, are cash, according to Circle.\n\nLast week, Circle cut ties with collapsed crypto-friendly bank Silvergate, which shut down on Wednesday. Circle had also used Silvergate to hold cash reserves until that point.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPantera\n\nCrypto-focused venture capital firm Pantera may have an unknown amount of exposure to SVB's collapse. As recently as last month, the firm counted the failed bank among just three custodians of its private funds, according to a February 3 SEC filing.\n\nPantera counts among the largest crypto-focused VC firms in the world; last year alone it raised $1.3 billion for a fund exclusively focused on blockchain-based projects.\n\nAvalanche\n\nThe Avalanche Foundation, which supports the Avalanche blockchain, announced Friday evening that it has \"a little over\" $1.6 million in exposure to Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nAvalanche's native token AVAX, currently boasts a market capitalization of $4.84 billion.\n\nIn light of recent news, we would like to confirm that the Avalanche Foundation has no exposure to Silvergate and a little over $1.6mm of exposure to Silicon Valley Bank.

        "title": "A Saudi-Iran reconciliation may ripple across the region. Here\u2019s why - CNN",
        "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region\u2019s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi and Jerusalem CNN \u2014\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have given each other just two months to prove they are serious about Friday\u2019s surprise agreement to normalize ties.\n\nBefore ambassadors are reinstated, the two nations are likely to be discussing ways to end almost seven years of hostility, a large task given how far-reaching the implications could be.\n\nThe reconciliation happens as Iran finds itself increasingly isolated on the world stage and Saudi Arabia changes the course of its foreign policy in favor of diplomacy instead of confrontation.\n\nWith a focus on economic development, Saudi Arabia and its neighbor, the United Arab Emirates, have in recent years moved to mend fences with most of their regional adversaries.\n\nRiyadh has walked back from a hawkish foreign policy it had adopted when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman entered the picture after his father King Salman took the throne in 2015. It has reconciled with Turkey, re-engaged with Syria, and supported a ceasefire in Yemen.\n\nBut it had left the most difficult of the dossiers, and perhaps the most important of all, till the end. It surprised the world last week when it announced a deal to normalize ties with Iran after years of talks that appeared to have borne no fruit.\n\nThe Iran-Saudi cold war has had an impact on almost every conflict in the region. Its resolution therefore could have equally strong repercussions. Here\u2019s what the ripple effects may be:\n\nYemen\n\nYemen has been one of the countries most affected by Riyadh and Tehran\u2019s spat. The two nations supported opposing factions in the 2014 Yemen civil war, and in 2015, a Saudi-led coalition intervened to fight the Iran-backed Houthi rebels that had overrun the country.\n\nThe Yemen war was likely the priority on the agenda for both countries, said Firas Maksad, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC and adjunct professor at George Washington University.\n\nThe country has witnessed relative calm following an April UN-brokered truce. That truce expired in October but appears to be holding anyway and Saudi Arabia has been engaged in direct talks with the Houthis.\n\nIn a Saturday statement, the Iranian mission to the United Nations said the reconciliation \u201cwould accelerate the ceasefire, help start a national dialogue, and form an inclusive national government in Yemen,\u201d Iran\u2019s state news agency IRNA reported.\n\nHussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, DC, told CNN that Iran may use its leverage against the Houthis to push for a resolution to the war.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that Tehran had to commit to pressuring its allies in Yemen to be more forthcoming on ending the conflict in that country, but we don\u2019t know yet what behind-the-scenes understandings have been reached,\u201d he said.\n\nA member of the Houthis\u2019 political wing, Abdulwahab al-Mahbashi, told Lebanon\u2019s al-Mayadeen TV that a resolution to the Yemen conflict must be achieved through direct negotiations with Riyadh as the Houthis are not \u201csubordinate\u201d to the Iranians, Al Arabiya reported Sunday.\n\nLebanon\n\nLebanon has been suffering a crippling financial crisis. Its once-closest Arab ally and benefactor Saudi Arabia largely disengaged from it following a years-long spat prompted by Iran-backed Hezbollah\u2019s clout in the country.\n\nRelations hit their lowest in 2021, when Saudi Arabia and some of its Gulf Arab allies withdrew ambassadors from Beirut following the then-Lebanese information minister\u2019s earlier criticism of the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s war in Yemen.\n\nEnvoys later returned, but Saudi-Lebanese ties are still frosty.\n\nBoth Hezbollah and the Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati praised the Saudi-Iran deal, with Mikati calling it an \u201copportunity to breathe in the region, and look to the future.\u201d\n\nAnalysts, however, say that doesn\u2019t mean that Lebanon\u2019s relations with Riyadh will improve automatically.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan on Friday said that Lebanon needed \u201cLebanese rapprochement\u201d for the situation in Lebanon to improve, not \u201cSaudi-Iranian rapprochement,\u201d Al Arabiya reported.\n\nThe deflective answer suggests that Saudi Arabia may be separating its grievances with Lebanon from its conflict with Iran.\n\n\u201cLebanon is not high on the priority of policy-makers in Riyadh,\u201d said Firas Maksad.\n\n\u201cThere are much more consequential files in Riyadh to be concerned about before addressing the challenges in Lebanon,\u201d he told CNN, adding that Lebanon is currently more important to the Iranians than it is to the Saudis, and that unless that changes, Hezbollah \u201cin its current form\u201d is likely to remain \u201cthe dominant player in Lebanon.\u201d\n\nIsrael\n\nThe reconciliation has also made its way to Israel\u2019s domestic political debate.\n\nHours before the deal was announced, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Italy, extolling one of his major goals: Normalization with Saudi Arabia.\n\nFor Israel, peace with Saudi Arabia is seen as the apex of normalization agreements. Even though behind-the-scenes relations have been ongoing for years, full-blown peace would be a major achievement, and one of the key elements in forming a regional alliance to counter Iran.\n\nThen reality hit later on Friday that Israel\u2019s longtime and foremost foe, and Netanyahu\u2019s would-be next best friend, were reconciling. And the blame game began in the Israeli political establishment.\n\nIsraeli newspaper Haaretz cited an unidentified \u201csenior political source in Rome\u201d as blaming the former government, led by Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid for the reconciliation.\n\nIn turn, former prime ministers Lapid and Bennett said Netanyahu has been neglecting the situation in the broader Middle East, focusing instead on his government\u2019s efforts to enact a controversial judicial overhaul.\n\nLapid tweeted that blaming him for the deterioration of the relationship with Saudi Arabia was \u201cdelusional,\u201d saying that while he and Bennett were in power, Riyadh signed an aviation agreement with Israel, direct flights for the Hajj were arranged and a security agreement related to islands in the Red Sea was signed with Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cAll this came to a screeching halt when the most extreme government in the country\u2019s history was established here and it became clear to the Saudis that Netanyahu was weak and the Americans stopped listening to him,\u201d Lapid tweeted.\n\n\u201cThe countries of the world and the region are watching Israel in conflict with a dysfunctional government that is engaged in systematic self-destruction,\u201d Bennett tweeted on his own thread.\n\nNetanyahu did not mention the deal in remarks ahead of the weekly Israeli Cabinet meeting on Sunday, and the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had no comment on the development.\n\nIraq\n\nIraq, which hosted several rounds of talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia, was quick to welcome the reconciliation. Analysts say it\u2019s in Baghdad\u2019s interest for the reconciliation to go through as the country had become an arena for Iranian-Saudi rivalry since the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003.\n\n\u201cIran has used Iraq to add pressure to Saudi Arabia in all areas, including political, economic and specifically security pressure,\u201d said Ihsan Al-Shammari, a politics professor at Baghdad University and head of the Iraqi Centre for Political Thought.\n\nIraq, he said, missed out on improving ties with Saudi Arabia and potentially large investments in the country due to Iran\u2019s heavy influence in the country.\n\nIran-aligned parties have long held influence in Iraqi politics and have at times caused political deadlock that has culminated in violence.\n\nAl-Shammari said Saudi Arabia would want Iran to rein in some of its allies in Iraq, especially armed paramilitary groups that it sees as a security threat. He added however that that may be a pipe dream as Iran sees Iraq as a vassal state and that its allies in parliament will want to preserve their Tehran-aligned interests.\n\nThe Iranian foreign ministry didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMedia wars\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have for years been engaged in a bitter media war, where news outlets allegedly backed by each government have been accused of inciting against the other.\n\nIran\u2019s state-backed Arabic language news channel Al Alam and English language Press TV regularly run programming critical of Saudi Arabia and are blocked in much of the Arab world. Saudi Arabia in turn is accused by Iran of funding Iran International, a Farsi language news channel that regularly interviews Tehran\u2019s adversaries and covers protests against the government. Iran has labeled the channel a \u201cterrorist organization.\u201d Iran International has denied connections to the Saudi government. Saudi Arabia also owns the Farsi franchise of the British newspaper The Independent.\n\nHow the media war plays out will demonstrate the viability of the Iran-Saudi agreement to normalize relations. Analysts have said Saudi Arabia has invested in Persian-language media outlets to build leverage over Iran in talks after over a decade of an Iranian media assault against Saudi Arabia. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Saudi Arabia has agreed to tone down critical coverage of the Islamic Republic by Iran International, citing unidentified officials from both countries. Last month, Iran International said it was relocating its operations to Washington, DC from London due to \u201cthe Islamic Republic\u2019s threats.\u201d\n\nThe digest\n\nPolls show Erdogan lags opposition by more than 10 points ahead of May vote\n\nPolls show the Turkish opposition\u2019s presidential candidate, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leading President Tayyip Erdogan by more than 10 percentage points ahead of elections on May 14 seen by many as the most consequential vote in Turkey\u2019s recent history, Reuters reported. The polls also show the opposition bloc leading the parliamentary race, at least six points ahead of Erdogan\u2019s AK Party (AKP) and its allies.\n\nBackground: Erdogan faces the biggest challenge to his 20-year rule after the erosion of his popularity during a cost-of-living crisis. Victims of last month\u2019s earthquake are also reconsidering their loyalty in previous AKP strongholds.\n\nWhy it matters: The elections will decide not just who leads Turkey but how it is governed, where its economy is headed and what role it may play in easing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nIran says it pardoned 22,000 protesters\n\nIranian judicial authorities have pardoned 22,000 people who took part in anti-government protests, judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on Monday, the official IRNA news agency reported. \u201cSo far 82,000 people have been pardoned, including 22,000 people who participated in (the) protests,\u201d Ejei said. He did not specify over what period the pardons were granted or if or when the people had been charged.\n\nBackground: Iran has been swept by protests since the death of a young Iranian woman Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country\u2019s morality police last September. Iranians from all walks of life have taken part, marking one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution.\n\nWhy it matters: State media reported early last month that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had pardoned \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of prisoners including some arrested in the protests in a deadly crackdown on dissent, but didn\u2019t specify how many.\n\nSaudi crown prince launches new airline\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) announced the launch of Riyadh Air, a new carrier owned by his $600 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Saudi state news agency SPA reported Sunday. The airline is expected to bring up to $20 billion in non-oil revenue and create more than 200,000 jobs, it said.\n\nBackground: Saudi Arabia\u2019s Gulf Arab neighbors already operate some of the biggest airlines, including the UAE\u2019s Etihad and Emirates, Doha\u2019s Qatar Airways and Ankara\u2019s Turkish Airlines. Riyadh Air aims to connect passengers \u201cto over 100 destinations around the world\u201d by 2030, said SPA, and will be chaired by PIF\u2019s governor with British business tycoon Tony Douglas as its CEO. Saudi Arabia has been in advanced negotiations to order almost 40 A350 jets from Airbus, Reuters reported.\n\nWhy it matters: Saudi Arabia has been playing catchup with its Gulf Arab neighbors who for years have spent on tourism, entertainment and aviation. The oil-rich kingdom has been on a quest to diversify its sources of revenue beyond oil and gas and refashion its image into a more global and liberal international player.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nA city that was once reduced to rubble is now reviving its most prized cultural treasures. I spoke to the woman behind that effort, @UNESCO Director-General @AAzoulay who has just returned from Mosul. pic.twitter.com/7Zj6IZCSgF \u2014 Becky Anderson (@BeckyCNN) March 10, 2023\n\nDirector General of UNESCO Audrey Azoulay speaks to CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson about recent efforts to revive the most cherished sites of Mosul, an Iraqi city that was destroyed during the battle with ISIS. Mosul was seized by ISIS in 2014 and later liberated in a violent battle in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe country in general, but Mosul in particular, was completely destroyed, and especially the Old City, by the occupation, by the consequences of the occupation, by ISIS,\u201d said Azoulay, who is working alongside UAE experts on a reconstruction project in Mosul.\n\nWatch the report here.\n\nAround the region\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Dubai's burgeoning hip-hop scene 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nThink of the UAE and you might not immediately think of hip-hop, but in recent years, Dubai has become home to a small and dedicated group of artists who rap in Arabic about local culture.\n\nPerhaps the biggest star is Mustafa Ismail, better known as \u201cFreek,\u201d a Somali rapper who was born and raised in the UAE. He has toured countries including the UK and performed at shows that featured the likes of Future, Gucci Mane, and Wu-Tang Clan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a culture here,\u201d said Ismail. \u201cThere\u2019s a story to tell, and people like me that grew up here want to hear a story of a kid that grew up in UAE, or Dubai. This is what hip-hop is all about.\u201d\n\nAlmost nine in 10 people in Dubai are not citizens of the UAE, many of whom have been born and raised in the Gulf city. Its burgeoning hip hop scene tells the story of the city\u2019s diversity.\n\nIsmail created a unique sound by performing drill rap in Arabic, a genre for which he is one of the most recognized artists in the region. His lyrics are a mix of accents and cultural references that reflect Dubai\u2019s diverse demographic makeup.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really think it\u2019s going to get that big, to be honest, until my friend told me you\u2019re trending on Twitter,\u201d said Ismail. \u201cIt was my first, kind of, viral video. This is what gives you another push. So, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nOther artists are also making an impact on the local scene.\n\nChristopher Esho is the creator of RAPDXB, a new platform that curates playlists, releases interviews and brings artists together to make music. He says there is a culture and history of rap music in Dubai, but adds that the city lacks a hub for the genre.\n\n\u201cThere haven\u2019t been record labels, there haven\u2019t been communities, there haven\u2019t been concerts that are celebrating this talent,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a local buzz that\u2019s been giving the artists exposure.\u201d\n\nRAPDXB recently released its first album, featuring a number of the UAE\u2019s leading rappers. \u201cThe goal is uniting the culture and cultivating the community,\u201d says Esho.\n\nSuch projects, as well as music festivals and local record labels, have been giving the local hip-hop scene a much-needed platform, and artists say they\u2019re just beginning.\n\n\u201cThe hip-hop scene in Dubai is growing. If you see the hip-hop scene in Dubai 10 years ago and now, it\u2019s a huge difference. It is even going to get crazier,\u201d said Ismail.\n\nBy Yara Enany\n\nPhoto of the day"
