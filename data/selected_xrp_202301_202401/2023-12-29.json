        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The Broad Ripple neighborhood experienced a brutal 2023, with several shootings and lingering construction on its main street. Business owners there hope 2024 brings better days for the entertainment district.\n\n\"We're ready for you to come back,\" said Patrick Sparks, who has owned Brick House Piano Bar for nearly a decade. \"Come back to us. We need your support and we need your business.\"\n\nBroad Ripple bars will likely see a lot of their customers come back for New Year's Eve celebrations Sunday night.\n\n\"There's a lot of different kinds of bars here, so it's fun,\" said Chris Good, who visited Kilroy's Bar & Grill in Broad Ripple on Friday night. \"I think I will be here for New Year's Eve.\"\n\nSparks said the business is needed more than ever. He claims Brick House lost $200,000 in 2023 due to both construction on Broad Ripple Avenue and violence in the district.\n\nThe tipping point came in June, when three people died in a shooting during the early morning hours.\n\nHe said business owners are working together to make the neighborhood safer going into 2024, including employing off-duty cops on busy weekend nights.\n\n\"We're working really hard,\" Sparks said. \"We meet once a month to get Broad Ripple back to the way it used to be. We like it here.\"\n\nIMPD has also increased patrols since the deadly shooting in June.\n\nGood considers himself a Broad Ripple regular. He believes visitors should not have to worry about safety.\n\n\"If you come out and do your own thing and not get in trouble, you're not going to have trouble,\" Good said. \"You have to go looking for trouble if you're trying to find it. It's pretty simple.\"\n\nSparks hopes that trouble stays far away from Broad Ripple in the New Year.\n\n\"We'd love to have you back,\" Sparks said."

        "title": "Nebraska 2024 predictions: Dylan Raiola's ripple effects and non-gridiron guesswork - The Athletic - The New York Times",
        "content": "LINCOLN, Neb. \u2014 The biggest moments of the season in the College Football Playoff semifinals are nearly upon us. At Nebraska, it means only that the Cornhuskers are on to next year.\n\nThe time has arrived for my annual predictions for the year ahead.\n\nMuch of my 2023 forecast held up well. These especially hit the mark:\n\nDylan Raiola will headline Nebraska\u2019s 2024 recruiting class.\n\nThomas Fidone and Teddy Prochazka will realize their potential. \u2026 More specifically, both will start and avoid serious injuries.\n\nThe Blackshirts will get a face-lift. \u2026 Tony White is set to bring a new vibe.\n\nBut in reviewing what I predicted, much of the material felt obvious or vague. My pledge this year is to be more bold and specific. To help me stay on track, I\u2019m incorporating a few sports other than football to craft this look at the next 12 months.\n\nAs always, my picks on the wins and losses next fall will come later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s to 2024. Let\u2019s get to it.\n\n1. An offensive coaching shift will impact at least two position groups.\n\nMarcus Satterfield isn\u2019t going anywhere as offensive coordinator. But I don\u2019t expect him to coach the quarterbacks next year. Coach Matt Rhule didn\u2019t want to talk about a possible change Dec. 20 as he unveiled the Huskers\u2019 recruiting class.\n\nRhule\u2019s answer said more than he intended. Something is seemingly in the works. The original plan for 2023 did not involve Satterfield as the QB coach. Rhule will find a solution this year \u2014 and likely has identified a candidate who\u2019s still at work in college or in the NFL.\n\nWith Raiola and fellow true freshman Daniel Kaelin incoming in a matter of days, there is an urgent need for Nebraska to employ a position coach who\u2019s dedicated to their growth. An easy place to look is at Glenn Thomas, the Pittsburgh Steelers assistant who coached quarterbacks and helped coordinate the offense with Rhule at Temple and Baylor. Offensive analyst Adam DiMichele factors in the equation, too.\n\nBut because of the attractiveness of the job, Rhule can search outside his immediate coaching circle, as he did last year in finding Tony White, a home run hire.\n\n2. The Huskers will add a quarterback, running back and wide receiver to their group of newcomers by the summer.\n\nChubba Purdy is gone, leaving Nebraska with one returning QB on scholarship in Heinrich Haarberg. Haarberg is the consummate teammate. But he\u2019s not what the Huskers want as a primary option at quarterback, despite his five wins in eight starts this year as a sophomore.\n\nOtherwise, the roster includes three walk-ons and the two incoming true freshmen. Lack of depth and experience is a concern. The Huskers ought to scour the transfer portal for a veteran who fits the Rhule mold and won\u2019t balk at handing the spotlight to Raiola if the freshman is ready.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Huskers have young options aplenty at receiver, but they need a leader for the position group and natural WR1. And at running back, Nebraska is one misstep away from facing a big bind in the spring as Gabe Ervin and Rahmir Johnson recover from injuries. Dante Dowdell, in the portal from Oregon and scheduled to visit Lincoln in January, deserves Nebraska\u2019s top recruiting effort.\n\n3. Nebraska basketball will make the NCAA Tournament.\n\nFred Hoiberg\u2019s fifth team is off to a 10-2 start, equaling Nebraska\u2019s best 12-game opening stretch since 1994-95. With a win Friday night at home against South Carolina State, the Huskers will close nonconference play with one loss for the fifth time since World War II.\n\nNebraska boasts nice wins against Michigan State and at Kansas State. But a 29-point loss in Lincoln against Creighton and a second-half collapse at Minnesota tempered some of the early excitement.\n\nThe Huskers have made one NCAA appearance in the past 25 seasons. With a NET ranking of 57, this is doable. The Big Ten appears manageable for Nebraska to finish at .500 or better in league play, which should be enough to get in. Early January brings Indiana and Purdue to Pinnacle Bank Arena, sandwiched around a trip to Wisconsin. The Huskers need to get a win in that stretch.\n\nAnd they need big man Rienk Mast to return from minor knee surgery as soon as possible. He and Juwan Gary, complemented by Josiah Allick, give the Huskers a legit Big Ten frontcourt.\n\n4. Jordy Bahl will contribute to multiple no-hitters and spur record attendance figures for the Nebraska softball team this spring.\n\nOK, I\u2019m not going out on a limb with the second part of that prediction. Since Bahl, the prodigal daughter who won a pair of national championships at Oklahoma, announced her transfer home to Nebraska in June, the Huskers have been exploring options to expand the capacity of Bowlin Stadium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeason ticket requests skyrocketed. Nebraska is looking to find escape routes from the field for Bahl to avoid a constant crush of postgame attention. She\u2019s going to create waves.\n\nThe junior out of Papillion-LaVista is at her best in the big moments. She finished 7-0 with an ERA of 0.18 in the 2023 NCAA postseason. Without the monumental expectations that the Sooners faced, Bahl\u2019s every pitching appearance with the Huskers will feel like a big event. She combined with other pitchers for two no-hitters at Oklahoma and tossed a solo no-no against Iowa in 2022. More are coming.\n\nGO DEEPER 'Oh, my God, it's happening': Why softball champ Jordy Bahl upended it all to come home\n\n5. Raiola will emerge as the clear No. 1 at QB in the spring.\n\nHe brings an NFL arm and a rare level of physical preparedness. Outside of Arch Manning, I\u2019m not sure if a QB has entered the college game in recent seasons with the same kind of training as Raiola. He\u2019s worked with several of Dominic Raiola\u2019s QBs from the elder Raiola\u2019s time with the Detroit Lions. Dylan rubbed elbows with the likes of Patrick Mahomes and has trained with the coaches of several former and current NFL quarterbacks.\n\nRhule said in an interview Dec. 20 that Raiola\u2019s arm talent stacked up well against the college QBs he scouted at numerous pro days as coach of the Carolina Panthers.\n\nStill, the odds are usually stacked against a true freshman to succeed immediately. Look at Manning, who could sit for a second consecutive season at Texas next fall. The difference? Nebraska doesn\u2019t have a player who\u2019s anything like Quinn Ewers ahead of Raiola. His time is coming fast.\n\nGO DEEPER The family forces that guide 2024 top recruit Dylan Raiola\n\n6. Raiola\u2019s presence will provide a shot in the arm for Nebraska in 2025 recruiting.\n\nIf Raiola had picked the Huskers in the spring and not spent more than six months committed to Georgia, Nebraska\u2019s recruiting class likely would have looked more like the vision that fans saw in March, when Raiola visited Lincoln with a cast of four- and five-star talents.\n\nIn the end, the way it turned out might benefit Rhule. He signed a group of players who want to be at Nebraska. They didn\u2019t pick the Huskers to play alongside Raiola. In building a foundation with two classes that include more than 80 players, Rhule can more easily afford to swing big in the 2025 class. Today in recruiting, more risk than ever comes with the pursuit of elite prospects. Their patience wears thin fast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNebraska will win a few battles, notably at the offensive skill spots, early in the 2025 cycle.\n\n7. The Memorial Stadium renovation project will come into focus with plans for even more work outside of the playing venue.\n\nNebraska athletic director Trev Alberts announced a plan in September to spend $450 million to demolish the south end of Nebraska\u2019s 100-year-old stadium and modernize the whole facility. You think that\u2019s a big project? It is, but I suspect the school would like to do much more.\n\nWork to prepare the stadium for the renovations begins in February. South Stadium and its 22,000 seats will be removed a year from now. Decreased capacity is coming in 2025.\n\nAs the university system in 2024 seats a new president, to whom Alberts will report and work alongside on the announced project, expect talk to increase about future phases of construction to build an immersive experience for fans from the time they arrive in the vicinity of Memorial Stadium.\n\nWhat will Nebraska volleyball do to up the ante in 2024? (Steven Branscombe / Getty Images)\n\n8. Nebraska volleyball will open the season ranked No. 2 and return to the final four.\n\nA bonus prediction: Coach John Cook is going to do something big. He hinted at it this month before Texas blitzed the Huskers in the national championship match.\n\nWhat could Cook attempt for an encore after Nebraska filled Memorial Stadium four months ago? It might involve a neutral-site match to capitalize on the Huskers\u2019 popularity. Use your imagination. Cook, who turns 68 in April, is using his.\n\nThe Longhorns, seeking a third consecutive title, will start at No. 1. The Texas domination of Nebraska (and Wisconsin) in Tampa will fuel the Huskers to improve on their deficiencies with a seasoned group of players \u2014 including a big senior class led by Lexi Rodriguez and Merritt Beason in their final opportunity to win a championship.\n\nA tougher-than-ever Big Ten, with the addition of four Pac-12 transfer programs, will sharpen Nebraska on its quest to reach Louisville and get another shot at the big prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. The bowl drought will end.\n\nSimple as that. Nebraska will play in a 13th game for the first time since 2016. It\u2019s a seven-year streak, abhorrent for a program that\u2019s won or shared 46 conference championships, five national championships and played in 54 bowl games. But it\u2019s real.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the longest drought among power-conference programs nationally. Next behind Nebraska? Vanderbilt, with a five-year postseason absence.\n\nGO DEEPER Nebraska's season ends exactly how it started \u2014 a late collapse in a disappointing defeat\n\n10. White will get a head-coaching job.\n\nThe 44-year-old defensive coordinator nearly got plucked this year. White re-upped at Nebraska and received a pay raise to $1.6 million. He\u2019s the highest-paid assistant coach in Nebraska history. White deserves the distinction after he rebuilt a defense in his first year that ranked No. 8 nationally in allowing 4.62 yards per play.\n\nThe task in 2024 grows more difficult as the Huskers add Ohio State, USC and White\u2019s alma mater, UCLA, to the schedule. But a veteran defense returns that looks like it could rate as Nebraska\u2019s best group since 2010.\n\nDefense again figures to serve as Nebraska\u2019s strength. White\u2019s dynamic personality adds an element to his attractiveness as a head-coaching candidate. Athletic directors will notice.\n\n(Top photo: Dylan Widger / USA Today)"

Look at Manning, who could sit for a second consecutive season at Texas next fall. The difference? Nebraska doesn\u2019t have a player who\u2019s anything like Quinn Ewers ahead of Raiola. His time is coming fast.\n\nGO DEEPER The family forces that guide 2024 top recruit Dylan Raiola\n\n6. Raiola\u2019s presence will provide a shot in the arm for Nebraska in 2025 recruiting.\n\nIf Raiola had picked the Huskers in the spring and not spent more than six months committed to Georgia, Nebraska\u2019s recruiting class likely would have looked more like the vision that fans saw in March, when Raiola visited Lincoln with a cast of four- and five-star talents.\n\nIn the end, the way it turned out might benefit Rhule. He signed a group of players who want to be at Nebraska. They didn\u2019t pick the Huskers to play alongside Raiola. In building a foundation with two classes that include more than 80 players, Rhule can more easily afford to swing big in the 2025 class. Today in recruiting, more risk than ever comes with the pursuit of elite prospects. Their patience wears thin fast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNebraska will win a few battles, notably at the offensive skill spots, early in the 2025 cycle.\n\n7. The Memorial Stadium renovation project will come into focus with plans for even more work outside of the playing venue.\n\nNebraska athletic director Trev Alberts announced a plan in September to spend $450 million to demolish the south end of Nebraska\u2019s 100-year-old stadium and modernize the whole facility. You think that\u2019s a big project? It is, but I suspect the school would like to do much more.\n\nWork to prepare the stadium for the renovations begins in February. South Stadium and its 22,000 seats will be removed a year from now. Decreased capacity is coming in 2025.\n\nAs the university system in 2024 seats a new president, to whom Alberts will report and work alongside on the announced project, expect talk to increase about future phases of construction to build an immersive experience for fans from the time they arrive in the vicinity of Memorial Stadium.\n\nWhat will Nebraska volleyball do to up the ante in 2024? (Steven Branscombe / Getty Images)\n\n8. Nebraska volleyball will open the season ranked No. 2 and return to the final four.\n\nA bonus prediction: Coach John Cook is going to do something big. He hinted at it this month before Texas blitzed the Huskers in the national championship match.\n\nWhat could Cook attempt for an encore after Nebraska filled Memorial Stadium four months ago? It might involve a neutral-site match to capitalize on the Huskers\u2019 popularity. Use your imagination. Cook, who turns 68 in April, is using his.\n\nThe Longhorns, seeking a third consecutive title, will start at No. 1. The Texas domination of Nebraska (and Wisconsin) in Tampa will fuel the Huskers to improve on their deficiencies with a seasoned group of players \u2014 including a big senior class led by Lexi Rodriguez and Merritt Beason in their final opportunity to win a championship.\n\nA tougher-than-ever Big Ten, with the addition of four Pac-12 transfer programs, will sharpen Nebraska on its quest to reach Louisville and get another shot at the big prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. The bowl drought will end.\n\nSimple as that. Nebraska will play in a 13th game for the first time since 2016. It\u2019s a seven-year streak, abhorrent for a program that\u2019s won or shared 46 conference championships, five national championships and played in 54 bowl games. But it\u2019s real.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the longest drought among power-conference programs nationally. Next behind Nebraska? Vanderbilt, with a five-year postseason absence.\n\nGO DEEPER Nebraska's season ends exactly how it started \u2014 a late collapse in a disappointing defeat\n\n10. White will get a head-coaching job.\n\nThe 44-year-old defensive coordinator nearly got plucked this year. White re-upped at Nebraska and received a pay raise to $1.6 million. He\u2019s the highest-paid assistant coach in Nebraska history. White deserves the distinction after he rebuilt a defense in his first year that ranked No. 8 nationally in allowing 4.62 yards per play.\n\nThe task in 2024 grows more difficult as the Huskers add Ohio State, USC and White\u2019s alma mater, UCLA, to the schedule. But a veteran defense returns that looks like it could rate as Nebraska\u2019s best group since 2010.\n\nDefense again figures to serve as Nebraska\u2019s strength. White\u2019s dynamic personality adds an element to his attractiveness as a head-coaching candidate. Athletic directors will notice.\n\n(Top photo: Dylan Widger / USA Today)"
