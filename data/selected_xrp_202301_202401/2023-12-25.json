        "content": "Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer says the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made moves in an effort to declare the digital asset XRP a security.\n\nStuart Alderoty says on the social media platform X that before commencing the lawsuit against Ripple, the regulator approached the company with a settlement that would have changed the trajectory of the digital asset industry.\n\n\u201cBefore the SEC sued Ripple, Chris and Brad (three years ago today), they offered us the following settlement: the SEC would announce to the market that XRP is a security and the market would be given a short window to \u2018come into compliance.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlderoty says Ripple turned down the offer for two big reasons.\n\n\u201cWe said no because: (1) XRP is not a security, and (2) the SEC never built a framework for crypto compliance. No matter the spin that Clayton, Hinman, Gensler or anyone else puts on this case now, it was always about one thing \u2013 proving that XRP is not, in and of itself, a security.\n\nWe put everything on the line. Few thought we would win. But we did. In the process we exposed the SEC for the hypocritical tyrant it is and the industry in the U.S. lived to fight another day. Onward to 2024.\u201d\n\nIn July, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that the automated, open-market sales of XRP did not constitute security offerings, contrary to the allegations of the SEC.\n\nAlderoty also says the ruling represents a big defeat for SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\n\u201cBiggest crypto story of 2023: Gary Gensler suffered his \u2018worst loss\u2019 when Judge Torres ruled that XRP is not a security\u2026\n\nTokens themselves are not securities. That\u2019s the law of the land.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, XRP is worth $0.616.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nIn a striking development, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has intervened in the ongoing legal battle involving Ripple and the classification of XRP as a security. Kraken\u2019s involvement follows a court order demanding U.S. exchanges to disclose private trading data of XRP transactions, including customer identities. Opting for user privacy over compliance, Kraken filed a motion to safeguard its clients\u2019 sensitive information, underlining the exchange\u2019s commitment to user trust and confidentiality.\n\nZakinov v. Ripple: The Core Issue\n\nAt the heart of the Zakinov v. Ripple lawsuit is the debate over XRP\u2019s classification as a security or a currency. The plaintiff, Zakinov, alleges Ripple offered XRP as an unregistered security. Ripple, countering this claim, parallels XRP with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite Ripple\u2019s efforts to challenge the lawsuit, it remains a significant legal hurdle, with U.S. District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton certifying the class action.\n\nOn July 13, Ripple triumphed in its lawsuit against the SEC, marking the first major victory for the crypto industry against the regulatory body. The court ruled that XRP is not a security, dismissing the SEC\u2019s argument that crypto tokens are inherently securities. This landmark decision has set a precedent for the classification and regulation of digital tokens in the United States.\n\nKraken\u2019s Involvement: A New Dimension\n\nKraken\u2019s motion to intervene adds a new layer to Ripple\u2019s ongoing legal challenges. While Ripple steadfastly denies any illegal issuance of securities, asserting XRP\u2019s equivalence to established cryptocurrencies, Kraken\u2019s entry focuses on the privacy implications of the court\u2019s order. This move not only highlights the exchange\u2019s dedication to client confidentiality but also places it at the center of a pivotal debate on privacy and regulatory compliance in the crypto space.\n\nWith Judge Analisa Torres\u2018s earlier ruling declaring XRP a non-security, the crypto world is keenly watching to see if Judge Hamilton will align with this decision. The outcome of these legal proceedings will not only impact Ripple and its users but also set a significant precedent for the broader cryptocurrency industry in the United States."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs the year 2023 draws to a close, Ripple\u2019s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, has declared the outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit as the \u201cBiggest Crypto Story of 2023.\u201d\n\nThe focal point of this groundbreaking development is the ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, who determined that XRP, the native cryptocurrency of Ripple, is not a security earlier. In a tweet on Wednesday, Alderoty highlighted the magnitude of the decision, emphasizing that it represented SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s \u201cworst loss\u201d and reshaped the regulatory environment for digital assets.\n\n\u201cBiggest crypto story of 2023: Gary Gensler suffered his \u201cworst loss\u201d when Judge Torres ruled that XRP is not a security\u2026Tokens themselves are not securities. That\u2019s the law of the land.\u201d Wrote Alderoty.\n\nThe legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had been ongoing for nearly three years. The SEC had alleged in 2020 that XRP was an investment contract falling under the purview of securities regulations. However, in July, Judge Torres categorically rejected this claim, stating that XRP is no longer qualified as a security.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision was based on a comprehensive evaluation of the nature of XRP, including its programmatic sales and other distributions. The ruling clarified that while Ripple\u2019s direct sales to institutional investors might constitute an investment contract, XRP\u2019s overall security classification was dismissed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe legal saga between Ripple and the SEC is far from over. The remedies phase, set to commence in February 2024, will determine the penalties Ripple may face for its past actions. The SEC has signalled its intention to appeal the federal court\u2019s summary judgment, and the upcoming phase will likely shape the trajectory of this prolonged legal duel.\n\nThat said, as the end of 2023 nears, the scrutiny of crypto firms by the SEC persists, fueling discussions among industry experts about the potential implications for the regulatory landscape of digital assets in the United States. Notably, Coinbase stands at a pivotal juncture in its battle against SEC securities violation allegations, with the recent denial of Coinbase\u2019s petition for rulemaking setting the stage for forthcoming oral arguments and a definitive decision, most likely in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance, having settled for a multi-billion amount, grapples with an SEC lawsuit accusing it of securities violations. On the other hand, the company\u2019s founder, Changpeng Zhao, now awaits a sentencing hearing on February 23 after admitting guilt to charges linked to money laundering and terrorism financing."

        "content": "Regulators and the industry struggle for the soul of crypto in a series of court battles.\n\nHere are the lawsuits to look for in 2024.\n\nA version of this story appeared in our The Guidance newsletter. Sign up here.\n\nGM, Joanna here!\n\nThe US crypto industry weathered a blizzard of lawsuits and enforcement actions this year. Don\u2019t expect the storm to calm in 2024.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201ccampaign of regulation by enforcement will continue,\u201d Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty told DL News.\n\nThe industry monitored every twist and turn in Ripple\u2019s lawsuit this year. It\u2019s seen as a test case for SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s assertion that most crypto assets are securities, and therefore fall under his authority.\n\nThat assertion underpinned every case the SEC brought against major crypto players in 2023 \u2014 including the world\u2019s biggest exchange, Binance, and the biggest US exchange, Coinbase.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission was no slouch either, bringing 134 enforcement cases against digital assets businesses, mostly targeting alleged fraudsters.\n\nAlong with the US Treasury Department, it took part in the record-breaking $4.3 billion settlement with Binance.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nMany of these lawsuits will be resolved. Some will drag on. New ones will no doubt be filed.\n\nHere are some to watch.\n\nFTX\n\nOne-time crypto wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried is awaiting sentencing on March 28. He was convicted of all seven counts of fraud and money laundering in one of this decade\u2019s most sensational financial crimes trials.\n\nMarch could also see Bankman-Fried subjected to a second trial over hundreds of allegedly illegal political donations and charges that he bribed Chinese officials.\n\nBinance\n\nThe SEC is still going after Binance, even though the exchange inked a deal with several other agencies in November.\n\nThe SEC has charged Binance with violations of securities laws, including operating an unregistered exchange, and the unregistered offer and sale of its BUSD stablecoin.\n\nBinance\u2019s new CEO, Richard Teng, must now guide the company through an SEC lawsuit, as the regulator did not settle its own case along with the other agencies.\n\nBinance\u2019s former CEO and co-founder, Changpeng Zhao, stepped down and pleaded guilty to one felony charge in November and his sentencing is scheduled for February 23. He could spend 18 months in prison.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase will fight its own SEC lawsuit in the Southern District Court of New York.\n\nThe SEC sued Coinbase in June, alleging it had failed to register as an exchange, and to register its staking-as-a-service programme.\n\nThe exchange is trying to get a court to compel the SEC to write crypto-specific rules \u2014 a move that some see as part of an ongoing PR campaign against the regulator.\n\nKraken\n\nKraken will fight the SEC\u2019s lawsuit in 2024. The agency alleges that Kraken was operating an unregistered exchange and commingling customers\u2019 funds with its own.\n\nIn response, Kraken\u2019s CEO David Ripley said that, counter to Gensler\u2019s refrain, Kraken does not list securities, and that there is no clear path for firms like his to registration with the SEC.\n\nRipple\n\nNext year could see the culmination of the SEC\u2019s multi-year legal fight with Ripple, which started when the agency alleged that the sales of XRP tokens to institutional investors and on the exchange represented an unregistered security.\n\nThe SEC suffered what the industry chose to take as a defeat in July, when Judge Analisa Torres decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security. while sales to sophisticated investors did.\n\nAll that\u2019s left now is for the two sides to hammer out the penalties Ripple may owe for the sale of XRP to institutional investors. Either side can appeal these decisions.\n\nCelsius\n\nAlex Mashinsky, co-founder and former CEO of Celsius, is slotted to face the court on September, the outcome of which will determine how regulators\u2019 cases against the bankrupt lender will play out.\n\nHe was arrested in July on seven criminal charges that alleged defrauding and lying to customers.\n\nAt the same time, Celsius was hit with a barrage of civil lawsuits from the SEC, CFTC, and Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThe FTC settled its lawsuit with Celsius, while the other two civil suits are paused pending the outcome of the criminal trial.\n\nTornado Cash\n\nThe cases against crypto mixer Tornado Cash will plough on in 2023, with developer Alexey Pertsev\u2019s trial in the Netherlands being scheduled for March 26 and 27.\n\nIn the US, Tornado Cash co-founders Roman Storm and Roman Semenov will continue their fight against accusations of facilitating money laundering and sanctions evasion. Storm pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan court in September. Both sets of plaintiffs are appealing.\n\nThe US Treasury sanctioned the popular Ethereum-based mixer in August 2022 for facilitating money laundering.\n\nIndustry players filed lawsuits and assailed the Treasury for violating Americans\u2019 financial freedom and Constitutional right to free speech. Two of those lawsuits have been thrown out by the courts.\n\nEmail me joanna@dlnews.com, or Telegram @joannallama.\n\nDo Kwon (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Rita Fortunato)\n\nDo Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one.\n\nIn a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again.\n\nThe surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea.\n\nProsecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022.\n\nPost of the Week\n\nCrypto companies are spending millions building an army of former defense and law enforcement officials to lobby against new rules shutting down crypto-financed terrorism.
