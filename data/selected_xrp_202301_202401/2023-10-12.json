        "content": "Ripple\u2019s price has been trending down over the past few days. The market is targeting key support levels against both USDT and BTC.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Edris\n\nThe USDT Paired Chart\n\nAgainst USDT, the price has been declining since the rejection from the $0.55 resistance area. It has also broken below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are located around the $0.5 and $0.54 levels, respectively.\n\nThe RSI indicator is showing values below 50%, indicating bearish momentum. Consequently, a drop toward the $0.43 support level appears likely in the short term.\n\nThe BTC Paired Chart\n\nThe situation looks worse against BTC. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are converging around the 1900 SAT level, potentially leading to a bearish crossover with the 50-day dropping below the 200-day. Moreover, the 1800 SAT support level seems to be breaking downwards, which could result in a rapid decline towards the 1600 SAT area.\n\nSimilar to the USDT paired chart, the RSI again suggests that momentum favors the sellers, making a bearish continuation more probable than a rebound."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nRipple, the blockchain payment company, offers pre-IPO shares for sale to US customers before they go public. This investment opportunity has stirred considerable interest in the crypto community.\n\nUS Residents Can Now Gain Access to Ripple\u2019s Pre-IPO Stock\n\nA few days back, Linqto, an investment platform, hinted they might let folks buy Ripple shares again because so many wanted them. Linqto has officially confirmed that these pre-IPO shares are available to the crypto community in the United States. Their mission is to make private market investments accessible to all.\n\nThus, the pre-IPO shares can be acquired through the Linqto platform, but there are a few steps to follow. Interested investors must create an account and go through a verification process using a government-issued ID.\n\nTo get in on the action, investors must commit a minimum of $2,500 to buy Ripple\u2019s pre-IPO shares. Each share is priced at $60.08. This rate is notably a 71.4% increase from the price observed just a few months ago in June.\n\nAdditionally, Linqto has introduced a discount for investors willing to put in at least $10,000. These more prominent investors can acquire shares at a discounted rate of $57.21.\n\nCan International Investors Grab Ripple\u2019s Pre-IPO Shares?\n\nWhile some have inquired about the availability of this investment opportunity for non-US investors, Linqto has not provided a specific response. Linqto\u2019s terms and conditions do not explicitly limit this opportunity to US residents, but they also do not state that it is open to other jurisdictions.\n\nHowever, they advise those outside the US to conduct their legal research to ensure it complies with local laws."

        "content": "Amid his company\u2019s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer has issued a public call for the United States to create a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nStuart Aldoroty, the chief legal officer for blockchain company Ripple, has expressed sheer dissatisfaction with the current regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency-related firms in the United States.\n\nIn the past few years, Ripple has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in its lawsuit with the SEC in a bid to get regulatory clarity for the XRP token, which it uses within the company\u2019s technology stack to facilitate seamless cross-border payments.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile the courts have eventually ruled in favor of secondary sales of XRP not being a non-security in the U.S., Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer (CLO) believes that much more is needed.\n\nIn a recent CNBC interview, Aldoroty recalled that \u201cXRP as a digital token is now uniquely classified as a non-security in the U.S.\u201d following the landmark July 13 judgment. Notably, XRP is the only crypto token that has received this clarity.\n\nHowever, Ripple\u2019s CLO shared the company\u2019s opinion that the issue regarding the classification of cryptocurrencies in the country does not require distinct court cases but a regulatory framework.\n\nHe told the CNBC audience, \u201cEven if we [Ripple] won in court, we don\u2019t think that this issue should be fought token by token, case by case, judge by judge. We think we need a rational regulatory framework.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRegulatory Framework Needed, But Not Near\n\nSpeaking further in the interview, Stuart Aldoroty shared the company\u2019s opinion that a comprehensive regulatory framework is necessary for crypto to thrive in the U.S. He cited the existence of such regulatory requirements in regions like the European Union, Australia, Japan, Brazil, and many others.\n\nYet, Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer fears that the U.S. may still be several years away from providing such regulatory clarity. He acknowledged ongoing efforts by leading policymakers to \u201cdevelop rational regulatory proposals.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Stuart Aldoroty is not very optimistic about the chances of these regulations moving forward in the current Congress session or the next one. In the meantime, Ripple continues to conduct most of its businesses offshore but hopes that regulatory clarity will come soon enough for the company to tap into the U.S. market fully."

        "title": "Can pets make you a better human? Study explores the ripple effect on social and environmental attitudes - News-Medical.Net",
        "content": "A recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports finds that people who have pets and more frequent positive contact with animals develop more positive attitudes towards other non-pet animals, the biospheric environment, and other humans.\n\nStudy: Exploring the role of our contacts with pets in broadening concerns for animals, nature, and fellow humans: a representative study. Image Credit: NatRomero / Shutterstock.com\n\nBackground\n\nThe human-pet relationship is a mutually beneficial and dynamic relationship that can influence the attitudes and behaviors of both humans and their pets towards each other. Empirical evidence indicates that contact with pets can trigger more positive attitudes and behaviors in humans towards other non-pet animals, such as farm animals and wild animals.\n\nPositive changes in human attitudes and moral concerns for animals are believed to be associated with social identification with animals. Social identification with animals is a process of cognitive broadening that connects humans and animals, in addition to increasing moral concerns of humans towards different social groups.\n\nIn the current study, scientists explore whether pet ownership and contact with pets can induce more positive attitudes in humans towards non-pet animals, the environment, fellow humans, and meat consumption. The researchers also determine whether these positive attitudes are triggered by the process of social identification with pets.\n\nStudy design\n\nThe study primarily focused on two types of contact with pets, including pet ownership and frequency of positive contact with pets. A total of 619 pet owners and 450 non-pet owners residing in Canada were enrolled in the study.\n\nAll study participants were provided with a questionnaire to report their attitudes towards non-pet animals, the biospheric environment, and fellow humans. The levels of their social identification with animals in three dimensions, including human-animal similarity, solidarity with animals, and animal pride, were also determined through the questionnaire-based survey.\n\nImportant observations\n\nA higher social identification with animals in all three dimensions was observed among pet owners as compared to non-pet owners. The frequency of positive contact with pets and positive attitudes towards non-pet animals and fellow humans were also higher among pet owners.\n\nRegarding attitudes toward the environment, pet owners were associated with higher biospheric environmental concerns and stronger beliefs in human-environment interdependence than non-pet owners. Moreover, a lower weekly meat consumption was found among pet owners compared to non-pet owners.\n\nLike pet ownership, more frequent positive contact with animals was also associated with most of these study variables.\n\nImpact of the dimensions of social identification with pets\n\nThe researchers also explored whether the dimensions of social identification with pets can predict the study variables.\n\nAmong the three dimensions, solidarity with animals was identified as the most consistent predictor of the study variables. Higher solidarity with animals was found to independently predict more positive contact with animals, more positive attitudes towards non-pet animals and fellow humans, higher biospheric environmental concerns and beliefs in human-environment interdependence, lower consumption of meat, and lower social dominance orientation.\n\nRegarding other dimensions, higher human-animal similarity was found to independently predict lower social dominance orientation. Higher animal pride was also found to independently predict higher consumption of meat.\n\nThe mechanistic analysis revealed that more positive contact with animals is associated with higher human-animal similarities, which is subsequently associated with lower social dominance orientation. This finding indicates that individuals who perceive pets as a \u201chigher status group\u201d are less likely to believe in a hierarchy that differentiates between individuals belonging to diverse social statuses.\n\nThe association between more positive contact with animals and higher solidarity with animals was found to positively impact beliefs in human-environment interdependence. Furthermore, the association between more positive contact with animals and higher solidarity with animals was found to influence weekly meat consumption.\n\nStudy significance\n\nThe study highlights the significance of having pets in human lives in terms of shaping human consideration for a broad range of social issues. The study finds that individuals who reside with pets develop more positive attitudes and moral concerns towards non-pet animals, fellow humans, and the biospheric environment.\n\nThe data-driven approach, as well as rigorous methodological and statistical approaches utilized in the current study, will help facilitate more research interest in human-pet relationships."
