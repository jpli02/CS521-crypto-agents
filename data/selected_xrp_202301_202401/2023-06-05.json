Congressman Glenn Thompson has been a steadfast supporter of the call for clarity in this space.\u201d\n\nAmong other speakers, the meeting will hear Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer (CLO) at crypto trading platform Coinbase, who has also shared his anticipation regarding the June 6 hearing in his tweet on June 2, adding that the crypto market regulation bill from congressmen Patrick McHenry and Glenn Thompson \u201clays a strong foundation for regulatory jurisdiction and definitions, BD rules, and consumer protections.\u201d\n\nSecondary market sales\n\nMore recently, pro-XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan shared an excerpt from the US Supreme Court case \u2018Slack v. Pirani\u2019 that came out last week and which he described as \u201canalogous to XRP in the secondary market if/where the XRP was sold as an \u2018investment contract.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs he added, \u201cXRP doesn\u2019t magically maintain status as a \u2018security outside the context of the initial \u2018contract,\u2019\u201d highlighting the passage in the excerpt which says that:\n\n\u201cSection 11 of the 1933 Act requires a plaintiff to plead and prove that he purchased securities registered under a materially misleading registration statement. (\u2026) The majority of courts have for years held that \u00a711(a) liability extends only to shares that are traceable to an allegedly defective registration.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, replying to a commenter wondering about the effect of the above case on the Ripple lawsuit, Hogan explained that he expected to see it in a Ripple brief on damages or in the Order by Judge Analisa Torres if she addresses secondary market sales.\n\nMeanwhile, the XRP token, which is at the center of the lawsuit, was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.54, up 1.66% on the day and gaining 11.32% across the previous week, as it advanced by a solid 15.64% on its monthly chart, according to the data retrieved on June 5."

        "title": "Ripple CTO David Schwartz Debunks \"Ripple Created XRP\" Narrative, Tells Real Story - Times Tabloid",
        "content": "David Schwartz, the chief technology officer (CTO) of the crypto solutions company and cross-border payment firm Ripple has made clarifications regarding the relationship between XRP and Ripple.\n\nAccording to Schwartz, the changes that were introduced to the XRP Ledger\u2019s (XRPL) system rules and operations by Ripple did not result in the creation of a new version of XRP.\n\nThe topic of XRP, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, being created by Ripple resurfaced on Twitter on Sunday following a comment from DS, the founder of the Metaverse project xSpectar. DS took to Twitter to point out a well-known fact that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has chosen to ignore in its ongoing lawsuit against Ripple.\n\nDS tweeted, \u201cRemember, XRP was created before its founders built Ripple. A simple and glaring fact which the SEC chooses to ignore.\u201d Responding to this post, an industry expert with the pseudonym Scam Detective reshared a thread he published in 2022 that contended that the XRPL native currency XRP was created by the Silicon Valley technology company Ripple.\n\nSchwartz immediately reacted, emphasizing that the company Ripple isn\u2019t the creator of the crypto asset XRP. The idea behind the claims from Scam Detective made no sense, the CTO said, citing the creation of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) project and Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof of stake.\n\nSchwartz wrote, \u201cThe entire logic behind this is nonsensical. When bitcoin cash was created, there were lots of people who already had it, and it wasn\u2019t because anyone connected to bitcoin cash in any way created it or gave it to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople held assets that became bitcoin cash before anyone even had the idea to fork bitcoin into bitcoin cash. Do changes in system rules or operations create new versions of existing assets?\u201d\n\nThat's not an unamibiguous question. People held assets that became bitcoin cash before anyone even had the idea to fork bitcoin into bitcoin cash. Do changes in system rules or operations create new versions of existing assets? \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 5, 2023\n\nNotably, former Ripple CTO Jed McCaleb restarted the XRP Ledger in 2012 which introduced changes in the network\u2019s rules and accounting systems, taking out the older rules and systems. This also resulted in the loss of the first 32,569 blocks on the XRP Ledger. Contrary to claims that this incident recreated all XRP tokens, Schwartz noted that nothing of such happened, citing Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof of stake blockchain.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cWhen Ethereum switched to proof of stake, did that somehow \u201cissue\u201d all the Ethereum that existed both before and after the new system launched? Was all Ethereum that will ever be mined created when the chain launched?\u201d\n\nIn addition, Schwartz noted that no new tokens were created when the Bitcoin blockchain was forked.\n\n\u201cRemember when Bitcoin forked into Bitcoin and bitcoin cash? It was entirely possible at the time that one side would have died out and the other just been \u201cbitcoin\u201d. Regardless of which side survived and which died off, no rational person would have claimed that was the birth of bitcoin or that bitcoin was issued in that process.\u201d\n\n<\n\n\u201cYes, we now think of it as a new cryptocurrency having been launched that we now call bitcoin cash. But no new currency was created by the fork itself, just as none would have been if one side had died off.\u201d\n\nOverall, it is worth noting that Ripple and XRP are two different entities. Some of the founders of XRP only happen to be co-founders of Ripple, the San Francisco-based cross-border payment firm.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"

        "content": "Ripple's digital currency platform builds on blockchain technology that supports the XRP token. Adobe Stock\n\nHaving already tackled cross-border transfers through its blockchain technology, Ripple is setting out to make its mark on dozens of digital currency projects by finding a way to let them work with one another.\n\nTo this end, Ripple recently released CBDC Platform, a product that enables central banks, governments and financial institutions to issue their own central bank digital currencies and stablecoins.\n\nRipple already uses the distributed ledger technology that supports the XRP token to enable international payments for e-commerce. This new initiative attempts to replicate that success as a catalyst for CBDCs and stablecoins, placing Ripple alongside the U.S. card networks in the race to make different digital assets interoperable.\n\nCBDC Platform is designed to address digital currency use cases for consumers and banks on a private or public ledger. The Platform includes the ledger technology; issuer capabilities for minting and distribution, redemption and destruction of tokens and settlement and support for digital wallets. The CBDC Platform's capabilities are primarily designed to meet the needs of regulated institutions such as commercial and central banks.\n\n\"As more and more central banks explore the development of a CBDC or stablecoin, we'll more broadly help address key use cases for wholesale and retail CBDCs with interoperability in mind,\" said Joe Vollono, director of business development for CBDC at Ripple. Wholesale CBDCs are designed for large entities, such as banks, that are moving large sums across borders. Wholesale CBDCs are considered simpler than retail CBDCs, which are designed for consumers.\n\nThe release of CBDC Platform follows Ripple's acquisition of Metaco , a Switzerland-based cryptocurrency-custody firm, for $250 million. That deal gave Ripple access to Metaco's ability to store, issue and settle different tokenized assets, while Metaco's technology reaches significantly more users. Ripple is already working with several regions on CBDC pilots, including Montenegro , the European Union, Palau and Bhutan, among others.\n\n\"It's the core technology behind widening financial inclusion, modernizing monetary policy, improving payment security and increasing cross-border payments efficiency,\" Vollono said.\n\nRipple's years of experience in enabling cross-border payments via its RippleNet product will inform how it works with central bank partners on cross-border CBDC payment systems, according to Vollono. Ripple's blockchain technology has drawn myriad businesses and other parties that sell internationally by enabling transactions to process without relying on correspondent banks to manage foreign currency exchange and other processing steps.\n\nThe RippleNet enterprise blockchain product is live in more than 70 countries, and is based on the ISO 20022 messaging standards that were developed to streamline international digital payments.\n\n\"RippleNet has evolved into a platform for cross-border payments with crypto-native services such as instant settlement, line of credit and liquidity services on top,\" Vollono said. \"The CBDC Platform is a continuation of this.\"\n\nWhile there are numerous CBDC projects underway or under consideration globally, these projects exist largely in isolation with most current transactions occurring inside borders. There are no established legal or standardized mechanisms for the exchange of CBDCs between countries or central banks, said Pavlov Sidelov, founder and chief technology officer at SDK.finance.\n\n\"In other words, there is no official framework in place that governs the cross-border transactions involving CBDCs,\" Sidelov said, adding the use of CBDCs in everyday user transactions or the retail sector is still in its early stages and is considered experimental.\n\nInteroperability is also a work in progress for stablecoins, which are a form of cryptocurrency that aims to mitigate market volatility by backing the stablecoin with traditional currency. There are more stablecoins currently in circulation, which could provide a head start, according to Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst at Gartner.\n\n\"Stablecoins backed by traditional currency are already there and exist today,\" Litan said. \"So why not just use stablecoins that are backed by a currency?\"\n\nLitan said she is more optimistic about the technology that underpins CBDCs than the actual digital currencies.\n\n\"It is getting easier to onboard people for blockchain use cases. And there are new protocols like LayerZero that make it easier to move from one blockchain to another,\" Litan said. LayerZero is a protocol that supports messaging between different distributed ledgers or blockchains, making it easier to execute cross-chain transactions.\n\nThere are discussions and projects that aim to create a global CBDC market, including use cases for retail CBDCs, Sidelov said.\n\nVisa's Universal Payment Channel concept, for example, is particularly significant in the context of the current lack of mechanisms for exchanging CBDCs internationally, Sidelov said.\n\nVisa's UPC is a network of blockchain networks, designed to enable digital currency payments both on and off of the Visa network. Both Visa and Mastercard are approaching governments on how the card companies' networks and scale could contribute to international CBDC projects. Visa recently announced it is working with Brazil's central bank to enable CBDCs to be used to broaden sources of investment for the country's small farms.\n\n\"By providing a secure and seamless means of transferring digital currencies, the UPC acts as a 'universal adapter' among different blockchains, facilitating the exchange of value for central banks, businesses and consumers, regardless of the specific form factor of the currency involved, which looks like a potential solution to the issue of cross-chain interoperability,\" Sidelov said.\n\n"
