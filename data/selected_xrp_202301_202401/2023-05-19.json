        "content": "XRP is a top-10 cryptocurrency that runs on the XRP Ledger, a blockchain network launched in 2012 by U.S.-incorporated payments company Ripple. It is distinct from most other cryptocurrencies in that XRP was \u201cpre-mined\u201d with Ripple creating its entire supply\u2014amounting to 100 billion XRP\u2014in one swoop instead of distributing it gradually.\n\nToday, there are around 52 billion XRP in circulation. The rest are held in escrow on the XRP Ledger, and are released at periodic intervals to Ripple.\n\nThe XRP Ledger is maintained by a small network of trusted node operators, many of which are tied to banks and other established financial institutions.\n\nRipple hoped the XRP Ledger would replace SWIFT as the system of choice for financial institutions that want to send money across borders cheaply. To do so, banks and payment companies would transfer assets in XRP, the currency that runs on the XRP Ledger. The typical XRP transaction takes 5 seconds, and the fee for a transaction is less than 0.00001 XRP.\n\nThe company admitted in 2018 that its ambitious goal wasn\u2019t realistic and shifted its focus to promoting XRP for cross-border payments for all institutions, including governments. While Ripple has gained traction persuading smaller banks and market makers to use XRP for remittances, XRP is still primarily a speculative asset.\n\nThe price of XRP in recent years has been heavily influenced by developments in a high profile court case, SEC v. Ripple. The case began in late 2021 when the U.S. securities regulator sued the company for allegedly selling unlicensed securities. A decision in the case is expected in the second half of 2023 and its outcome will have major implications for both XRP and the broader crypto market.\n\nRipple and XRP have a boisterous presence on social media and, in particular, on Twitter where the \u201cXRP army\u201d is forever boosting XRP and attacking its critics. Some claim the XRP army isn\u2019t real. Network analyst Geoff Golberg linked 70% of the XRP Army\u2019s Arabic-speaking accounts to a social media agency, which also deploys bots for state-backed Saudi disinformation campaigns.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nXRP Ledger Learning Portal\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nCrypto investing 101\n\nWhat Is Ethereum?\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nXRP Scanner"

        "content": "Ripple Labs has launched a new payment platform for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in Hong Kong. The San Francisco-based payment protocol and exchange network will partner with Fubon Bank, a Hong Kong unit of Taiwan\u2019s Fubon Financial Holding Co. as part of Hong Kong\u2019s new e-HKD (electric Hong Kong dollar) pilot program. The pilot program brings together various industry players to explore e-HKD use cases and implementation issues. The Ripple-Fubon Bank tie-up will offer solutions for real estate asset tokenization and equity releases using the CBDC.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong\u2019s e-HKD pilot puts the world on notice\n\nFast facts\n\nRipple announced in a press release Thursday that its new CBDC platform can facilitate central banks, governments and financial institutions to issue their own CBDCs and manage the digital currency\u2019s full life cycle. This will include both transactions and distribution.\n\nAs part of the CBDC pilot program launched by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) the same day, Ripple said it will work with Fubon Bank in Hong Kong to test real estate asset tokenization as a potential use case for the e-HKD.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor for Ripple to be one of the select few organizations participating in the HKMA\u2019s e-HKD Pilot Programme,\u201d said James Wallis, Ripple\u2019s Vice President of Central Bank Engagements & CBDCs, in the statement. \u201cWe now have the opportunity to demonstrate how real estate asset tokenization could be brought to the citizens of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe fully integrated solution will be an \u201cindustry-first use case demonstrating the power of leveraging a CBDC for real estate equity asset release,\u201d he added.\n\nRipple said that, through the program, commercial banks in Hong Kong will benefit from an ability to offer streamlined loan services and more flexible payments.\n\nIn its announcement Thursday, the HKMA said it will use the pilot to explore e-HKD use cases in six categories: full-fledged payments, programmable payments, offline payments, tokenized deposits, settlement of Web3 transactions and settlement of tokenized assets.\n\nA total of 16 banks, payment firms and blockchain companies will participate in the pilot program to test those use cases. These include state-owned Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, alongside HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Visa, Mastercard and Ant Group\u2019s Alipay.\n\nSee related article: XRP lawsuit: Judge denies SEC motion to seal documents in win for Ripple"

        "content": "Ripple CTO David Schwartz confirmed the company\u2019s CBDC Platform can interact with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and XRP token.\n\nThe company released an update on its CBDC Platform on May 18 detailing improvements to the project.\n\nCrypto publication Blockworks covered the story \u2013 detailing an email exchange with a Ripple spokesperson that made clear the CBDC Platform \u201cdoes not require XRP to operate\u201d and that central banks do not use or interact with the token.\n\nIn response, members of the XRP Army kicked up a storm, criticizing Blockworks for inaccurate reporting. However, as Blockworks author Katherine Ross explained, it is factually correct that the CBDC Platform does not use XRP and that central banks do not use XRP to operate the platform.\n\n\u201cThe headline we ran is not misleading though, we said that there was no direct need for XRP. Yes, there is an \u201coption\u201d for central banks to interact with or utilize XRP, but as I reported, banks using the platform \u201cdo not\u201d need to use it.\u201c\n\nXRPL and XRP can interact with the CBDC Platform\n\nSchwartz chimed in, saying the CBDC Platform operates on the \u201csame core technology\u201d as the XRPL and can connect with the XRPL and use XRP tokens.\n\n\u201cIt has the ability to interact with #XRPL and use XRP as a bridge currency for cross-currency and cross-border payments.\u201c\n\nIt was put to Schwartz that having a bridging option to the XRPL is not the same as central banks using the XRPL and XRP in their day-to-day CBDC Platform operations.\n\nThe Ripple CTO acknowledged there is no guarantee central banks will use the bridge. However, he maintained that the company\u2019s approach was to \u201cremove technical barriers\u201d and allow users to use XRP if they choose to \u2013 rather than force the matter. This, said Schwartz, makes for a better product experience.\n\n\u201cI never recommend building products that require people to use XRP (unless they\u2019re XRPL features) because that becomes a reason not to use the product.\u201d\n\nRipple CBDC Platform\n\nAn update on the CBDC Platform revealed Ripple had improved speed, lowered cost, and reduced settlement times since first announcing the project a year ago.\n\nIt was also mentioned that Ripple is working with more than 20 countries, including Palau and Montenegro, to roll out their respective CBDCs.\n\nRecent days have seen a strong run from XRP, which recorded an 18-day high on Thursday off the back of current events, including Ripple\u2019s acquisition of crypto custody firm Metaco.\n\nHowever (amid a market-wide downturn,) XRP\u2019s 24-hour performance is flat at the time of press.\n\nMentioned in this article"
