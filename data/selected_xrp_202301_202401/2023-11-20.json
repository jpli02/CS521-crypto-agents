        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIn a significant development for the cryptocurrency sector, Ripple\u2019s XRP has been identified as a preferred investment choice among the world\u2019s leading banks, according to a new report by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The BCBS, the principal global standard-setter for banks\u2019 prudential regulation, has introduced a comprehensive dataset focusing on banks\u2019 engagement with crypto-assets.\n\nThe BCBS Cryptoasset Data Collection Template\n\nThis dataset stems from a cryptoasset data collection template launched by the BCBS in 2018. The template was designed to align with the Committee\u2019s consultative documents from June 2021 and June 2022 on the prudential treatment of crypto asset exposures. It offers detailed insights into banks\u2019 crypto holdings, facilitating an analysis of their exposures. Data for this report was provided by nine banks from the Americas, seven from Europe, and two from other regions.\n\nXRP\u2019s Prominent Position in the Banking Sector\n\nThe findings reveal that XRP, the third-largest altcoin, constitutes a significant portion of the banks\u2019 cryptocurrency engagements. Specifically, XRP accounts for 2% of the total \u20ac9.4 billion exposure in the sector, amounting to approximately \u20ac188 million ($205 million).\n\nInvestment Perspectives on XRP\n\nAmidst a general anticipation for Bitcoin ETF approvals, Ripple\u2019s XRP has established itself as a solid and attractive investment option. John Deaton, a pro-XRP attorney and founder of CryptoLaw, recently advised against making investment decisions based on a fear of missing out (FOMO). He suggests investing in cryptocurrencies like XRP before such market sentiments take hold, citing examples of XRP\u2019s price movements around key events.\n\nConcurrently, Ali Martinez, a renowned crypto analyst, predicts a bullish trend for XRP. His analysis is based on the TD Sequential indicator and a notable increase in activities by XRP whales, signalling a potential shift in market dynamics."

        "content": "An unnamed Ripple executive believes XRP and XLM, two assets with similar functionalities, could serve as the Pepsi and Coca-Cola of the coming financial revolution in terms of central bank utility.\n\nFrancis Hunt (The Market Sniper), a veteran trader and technical analyst, revealed this while speaking with Versan and Vandell Aljarrah in the latest episode of the Black Swan Capitalist podcast.\n\nXRP and XLM: An Uncanny Similarity\n\n\u201cDo you believe that these two technologies are going to be the foundation of what\u2019s yet to come,\u201d Versan asked Hunt, pointing to the similarities between XRP and Stellar (XLM) in terms of their underlying technologies and their price movements.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRecall that Jedd McCaleb, one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), launched the Stellar network in 2014. Before this, McCaleb served as the Chief Technology of Ripple until 2013 when he left. Being one of the original architects of the XRPL, McCaleb\u2019s Stellar blockchain has similarities with the original ledger.\n\nInterestingly, XLM, the native token of the Stellar network, has continued to mirror XRP\u2019s price movements. When XRP rallied to an ATH of $3.3 in January 2018, XLM also surged to an ATH of $1.05. Upon XRP\u2019s collapse the next month, XLM also dropped. XLM also mirrored XRP\u2019s surge in April 2021 and similar surges this year.\n\nXRP and XLM Akin to Pepsi and Coca-Cola?\n\nIn the Black Swan Capitalist episode, Versan called attention to these similar price movements, asking for Hunt\u2019s opinion on the role both assets could play in the coming financial revolution.\n\nIn response, Hunt disclosed that his community has a high-ranking Ripple executive who has insider knowledge on the workings of the company. While he failed to mention who this executive is, Hunt revealed that the individual likens XRP and XLM to the Pepsi and Coca-Cola of the financial scene.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe rationale behind this classification is that XRP and XLM are going to fulfill the \u201csame functions,\u201d according to the unnamed Ripple executive. Notably, both assets would become useful in the upcoming financial revolution in terms of central bank utility. This already happens on a small scale.\n\n\u201cHe mentioned that one or two of the Middle Eastern players, some that were committed potentially to the one, automatically said that other of the nation states that are typically a little bit adverse, would go with the other one,\u201d Hunt remarked.\n\nIn essence, while the central banks of different nations would adopt XRP or XLM, both assets would provide similar functionalities. Additionally, the two assets would likely dominate the financial scene much like how Pepsi and Coca-Cola have taken a huge chunk of the soda industry."

        "content": "Mon 20 Nov 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nRipple, the crypto platform behind XRP, is committed to the tokenization of multiple assets. Among them, fungible tokens, stablecoins, and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC). As of the latest news, the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the decentralized public blockchain that Ripple uses for issuing XRP, has made progress. It is venturing into the tokenization of real assets, positioning Ripple as a key player in decentralized finance and the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nStrategic Evolution for Ripple\u2019s XRP Ledger\n\nThis Saturday, November 18th, David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer at Ripple, revealed in an interview a significant strategic change for the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the blockchain created by Ripple that supports XRP, Ripple\u2019s native asset.\n\nThe executive has announced that the XRPL is expanding with regards to the tokenization of assets. From now on, the blockchain will accommodate the tokenization of real-world assets, in addition to virtual assets such as stablecoins and CBDCs in particular.\n\nThis news resonates as a change in priority. At least, that is what can be inferred from Schwartz\u2019s explanations during the interview. It suggests that there is now a focus on the expanded potential of the XRPL blockchain, despite the popularity of XRP.\n\nThe Ripple executive particularly praised the unique position of the XRPL as the first layer 1 blockchain independent of Bitcoin technology\u2014a distinctive feature that has been maintained since its inception in the early 2010s.\n\nXRPL: David Schwartz Reveals XRPL's New Focus on Asset Tokenization #XRP https://t.co/Q0xZiyXvOZ \u2014 MOLT MEDIA (@MoltMoney) November 18, 2023\n\nXRPL, the Market Leader in the Tokenization of Real Assets?\n\nCould the XRPL blockchain position itself and emerge as the leader in the tokenization of real assets? Nothing is less certain at the moment. But in any case, the ambition is certainly there.\n\nIndeed, David Schwartz envisions the XRPL becoming the most important crypto platform dedicated to tokenizing real-world assets. This is due to its attractive features, including low transaction fees. However, it will have to break away from the competition.\n\nBecause with this development, the XRPL is entering into direct competition with behemoths of traditional finance. Specifically, JPMorgan and Bank of America, which are already very active in this area. This marks a notable advancement in the evolving ecosystem of blockchain.\n\nIn any case, the competition in this segment promises to be tough considering the potential represented by the asset tokenization market. According to estimates, it could be worth up to 30 trillion dollars by 2030. It\u2019s easy to see why this crypto segment is booming, attracting considerable interest from the giants of finance.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!
