        "content": "Newbie developers are increasingly departing a crypto project while more \u201cestablished\u201d ones (more than two years) and those categorized as \u201cemerging\u201d (who have been working for one to two years) have remained relatively resilient over the past year.\n\nA new study by Electric Capital shows that Ripple is one of the few projects that witnessed an increase in its developer counts as of October. The XRP ecosystem recorded more than 18% YoY growth and currently has 172 monthly active developers.\n\nPositive Developer Growth\n\nAccording to the report, projects such as Starknet and zkSync recorded increases of 4% and 6% YoY, respectively. While Starknet currently boasts 517 monthly active developers, the figure for zkSync stood at 229.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum-based privacy-first zkRollup, Aztec Protocol saw over 168% YoY growth and now has 76 monthly active developers. Modular data availability network Celestia was trailing closely behind with more than 145% YoY growth, registering 81 monthly active developers.\n\nTON, on the other hand, settled with a modest 8% YoY growth. Its monthly active developer count stood at 126.\n\nDeveloper Trend\n\nAs of October 1, 2023, there are 19,300 monthly active open-source developers. This marks a 27% decrease in developer numbers compared to October 1, 2022.\n\nNotably, the departing developers in the crypto sector primarily consisted of newcomers who had been involved in crypto for less than a year and were responsible for approximately 25% of all code commits.\n\nThe report highlighted a significant drop of 58% in the number of Newcomers, a moderate increase of 11% in Emerging Developers, and a slight 5% uptick in the count of Established Developers.\n\nElectric Capital software engineer Enrique Herreros further noted,\n\n\u201cDevs who stayed have been in crypto for longer and push code commits more days: Median 12 active weeks for devs still working vs 1 week for devs who left. Median 21 months experience for devs still working vs 5 months for devs who left.\u201d\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s important to note that there has been a decline in the number of developers over the past year, with a 27% decrease from October 1, 2022, and a 4% decline from October 1, 2021.\n\nDespite this recent drop, there remains a substantial increase of 66% in the developer count when compared to October 1, 2020, indicating the overall growth in the open-source developer community over the past three years."

        "content": "Any expectation that conflicts and terrorism can be contained in their impact is no longer tenable, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Sunday.\n\nIn an address at an event, Jaishankar, delving into geopolitical upheavals witnessing the world, said the ripple impact of what is taking place in the Middle East right now is still not entirely clear.\n\nThe external affairs minister said the consequences of various conflicts in a globalised world spread far beyond immediate geographies as he cited the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\"In different regions, there are smaller happenings whose impact is not inconsequential,\" he said.\n\nJaishankar also touched upon the challenge of terrorism and how it is being used as a tool of statecraft, in comments seen as an oblique reference to Pakistan's support to various terror groups.\n\n\"There is also the less formal version that is very pervasive. I am speaking about terrorism which has long been honed and practised as a tool of statecraft,\" he said.\n\n\"The basic takeaway for all of us is that given the seamlessness of our existence, any expectation that conflicts and terrorism can be contained in their impact is no longer tenable,\" Jaishankar said.\n\n\"A big part of this is clearly economic, but do not underestimate the danger of metastasis when it comes to radicalism and extremism,\" he added.\n\n\"No danger is too distant anymore,\" the external affairs minister noted.\n\nDelving into various aspects of geopolitics, Jaishankar said the last few years have witnessed a rising debt, often resulting from a combination of imprudent choices, unbiased borrowings and opaque projects.\n\nHe said market volatility has been difficult for smaller economies with a narrow trade basket.\n\nThose highly exposed to tourism or remittances have experienced the consequences of slowdowns strongly, Jaishankar said, adding that international financial institutions have not been able to respond to it adequately.\n\nThe external affairs minister also noted that a unipolar world is a \"distant history\" and that a bipolar world has become even more distant.\n\n\"If you look today at what is happening in the Middle East, a lot of it is actually, in a sense, the activities that are intrinsic to the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nJaishankar said key regional players are actually going to be dominant in regional situations compared to the past and that they are not going to leave that much space for global players or external players to come in.\n\n\"I think you can see that happening in Africa as well,\" he said."

        "title": "Expert States Why Ripple Has Upper Hand in Potential Settlement Talks with SEC - Times Tabloid",
        "content": "Wall Street veteran Linda P. Jones, an author and seasoned financial analyst, has recently shared her insights on the ongoing SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. She believes that Ripple now holds significant leverage in determining the terms of a potential settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nA Likely Settlement in SEC v. Ripple Lawsuit\n\nProminent XRP advocate and lawyer Fred Rispoli (freddyriz), acknowledging the recent developments, believes that discussions about a settlement between Ripple and the SEC are already underway. He shared his thoughts on X, stating that a settlement is the more likely option.\n\nRispoli noted, \u201cMy guess is settlement amounts are flying back and forth between the lawyers as I type.\u201d\n\nAmid mounting speculation within the XRP community regarding an impending settlement, optimism has grown now that the SEC has dropped charges against Ripple\u2019s executives.\n\nRispoli\u2019s comments got Linda Jones\u2019s attention, who agreed with his assessment and took it further, asserting that Ripple holds the trump card in its negotiations with the SEC. Jones stated, \u201cI agree, however, I think Ripple has a royal flush, meaning they aren\u2019t negotiating and can literally name their terms.\u201d\n\nJones emphasizes that Ripple is not just negotiating, it has the upper hand and can dictate its terms during the settlement process. Jones added, \u201cDue to exposure of the Hinman emails, the SEC has zero bargaining power. Ripple can 100% name their terms in the settlement.\u201d\n\nShe argues that the SEC is without bargaining power, thanks partly to the exposure of documents related to William Hinman\u2019s 2018 speech, in which he categorized Ethereum (ETH) as a non-security asset.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Options\n\nRipple\u2019s CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently highlighted Ripple\u2019s multiple victories over the SEC, which have boosted its prospects in this lawsuit. Notably, Ripple compelled the SEC to release the Hinman documents despite initial resistance.\n\nThe SEC has only two options: either to pursue an appeal to the Second Circuit or a settlement agreement with Ripple. Although some experts have speculated that Ripple could pay a huge amount in settlement fees, the outcome remains uncertain, and it is a matter of speculation as to which path the SEC will choose.\n\n<\n\nHowever, the next phase of the lawsuit will focus on remedies, where the court will determine the financial penalties Ripple may face for its alleged violation of securities laws through the sale of XRP to institutional clients.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"

        "title": "Ripple and SEC\u2019s Legal Battle Takes a Surprising Turn: Charges Dropped Against Ripple Executives - The Currency Analytics",
        "content": "In a surprising turn of events, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has notified the court of its decision to dismiss charges against individual defendants Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, and Chris Larsen, the executive chairman of the company. This move comes as a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, which has revolved around allegations of securities law violations related to the sale of the cryptocurrency XRP.\n\nThe decision to drop charges against Garlinghouse and Larsen effectively eliminates the need for a scheduled trial on the SEC\u2019s claims that these executives had aided and abetted Ripple\u2019s alleged violations of securities laws in the context of institutional sales of XRP. It also renders a previous scheduling order moot, making way for a new phase of legal proceedings in this high-stakes case.\n\nRipple and the SEC are now set to engage in discussions regarding a potential briefing schedule for the outstanding issue of institutional sales of XRP. This development could potentially reshape the course of the lawsuit and its eventual outcome.\n\nThe key issue at the heart of this legal battle pertains to the alleged violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, which mandates that securities must be registered with the SEC before they can be sold to the public, including institutional investors. Ripple, a blockchain company that developed and maintains the XRP cryptocurrency, is seeking remedies for its purported Section 5 violations in relation to its institutional sales of XRP.\n\nRipple\u2019s legal team has requested the court to consider November 9 as a suitable date to propose a briefing, allowing both parties ample time to deliberate on a potential settlement or contest regarding the institutional sales of XRP. This decision sets the stage for what may be a crucial phase in the legal proceedings, with far-reaching implications for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC has garnered significant attention and raised several important questions. One such question is whether the SEC will appeal the recent developments in the case. According to Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton, there will be no immediate appeal. It is apparent that the SEC did not dismiss the case with the aim of expediting an appeal process. Therefore, the appeal process is likely to be postponed until next year, as the SEC awaits a final judgment in the lawsuit.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events has left both the cryptocurrency community and legal experts speculating about the potential outcomes of this high-profile case. The implications of these recent developments are far-reaching and could significantly impact the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the United States.\n\nIt is worth noting that the decision to drop charges against Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen represents a pivotal moment in the legal saga. The SEC\u2019s allegations against these two Ripple executives were central to its case against the company, and their dismissal could have a cascading effect on the remaining issues in the lawsuit. However, Ripple\u2019s battle is far from over, as it still faces challenges related to XRP ODL sales, which remain a source of concern for the company.\n\nThe crypto community, as well as investors and enthusiasts of digital currencies, have been closely following the Ripple-SEC legal battle, as it has the potential to set important precedents in the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The outcome of this case could significantly influence how other cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects navigate the complex regulatory landscape in the United States and beyond.\n\nIn the wake of these recent developments, the debate surrounding the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC has intensified. Some view the SEC\u2019s decision to drop charges against the individual defendants as a sign that the regulatory body may be reevaluating its approach to the cryptocurrency industry. Others believe that this move could be a strategic maneuver as part of a broader legal strategy.\n\nEleanor Terrett, a journalist with Fox Business, has clarified the procedural aspects of the case. She pointed out that the SEC cannot immediately appeal the recent developments and must await a final judgment in the lawsuit before pursuing any appeals. This means that any potential appeal by the SEC will be delayed until the following year.\n\nAs this legal saga continues to unfold, the broader implications for the cryptocurrency industry and the regulatory landscape in the United States are becoming increasingly apparent. The outcome of the Ripple-SEC case could serve as a blueprint for how regulatory agencies approach cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects in the future."
