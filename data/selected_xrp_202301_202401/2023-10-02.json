        "content": "Ripple will no longer acquire chartered trust company Fortress Trust, following the news that Fortress lost $15m worth of customers\u2019 digital assets.\n\nThe cancelled deal followed hot on the heels of the news that up to $15m of Fortress Trust customer\u2019s digital assets were stolen. The theft was later blamed on Retool, a third party vendor that was victim to a phishing attack.\n\nLast month, Ripple revealed its intention to acquire the compliance firm for an undisclosed fee that was later confirmed to be under $250m.\n\nHowever, following the turbulence in the RegTech company, the deal has been called off.\n\nCEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse made a statement on social media. He said, \u201cA few weeks ago, we signed a letter of intent to acquire Fortress Trust \u2013 we\u2019ve since made the decision not to move forward with an outright acquisition, though Ripple will remain an investor.\n\n\u201cThe Fortress team is incredibly talented, and has built products solving real customer problems. While this outcome is different from what was originally planned, we\u2019ll continue to support them and hope to work together in the future.\u201d\n\nKeep up with all the latest FinTech news here.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 FinTech Global"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nData from crypto data tracker Whale Alert indicates 800 million XRP have been locked back into Ripple's escrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYesterday, Oct. 1, as reported, Ripple performed its monthly scheduled release of one billion tokens from its escrow, which was launched in 2017, to achieve XRP's price stability.\n\nThe escrow system used by Ripple serves this purpose: it enables a controlled and predictable distribution of XRP onto the market. Rather than flood the market with tokens, Ripple committed to releasing 55 billion XRP in monthly increments of one billion XRP within 55 months.\n\nAs a usual practice, after the one billion release each month, about 800 million XRP are returned to escrow and locked until the following month, with roughly 200 million XRP injected into the circulating supply.\n\nWhale Alert reports the return of 800 million XRP tokens to Ripple escrow in three transactions. The first was half a billion tokens, or 500 million XRP, worth $257,857,157, locked back into escrow. The second and third transactions carried 200 million XRP worth $103,233,285 and 100 million XRP worth $51,617,381, respectively.\n\nThe last 24 hours, according to Whale Alert, also saw a shift of 28,500,000 XRP worth $14,739,997 moved from an unknown wallet to Bitstamp.\n\nXRP price action\n\nOctober, colloquially referred to as \"uptober,\" is traditionally a positive month for the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Since 2013, only two months have yielded negative monthly returns for Bitcoin, according to historical data.\n\nThat said, expectations are quite high for the XRP price in October. At the time of writing, XRP was in the green, marginally up in the last 24 hours to $0.521.\n\nAt present, bulls are confronting a barrier at the $0.523 mark, which coincides with the daily MA 200. This is an important resistance level to keep an eye on since a break above it would clear the way for a possible rally to the much-coveted $0.64 level.\n\nOn the other hand, XRP seems to be building up support at near $0.50 in the event of price declines."

        "title": "'Ripple Effect' explores hybrid work | Penn Today - Penn Today",
        "content": "Every day, business scholars answer pressing questions in their research\u2014but what do their insights mean in practice? \u201cRipple Effect,\u201d the Wharton School\u2019s faculty research podcast, explores what inspired their studies and how their findings resonate with the world today. Last month\u2019s episodes highlight research into the evolving model of hybrid work.\n\nIn \u201cFinding Balance With the Hybrid Work Model,\u201d Matthew Bidwell, a management professor at Wharton, weighs in on the on the future of remote work and the hybrid work model, saying the last three years have been a surprisingly successful trial run.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019re commuting,\u201d says Bidwell, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what we did. And we didn\u2019t think too hard about, \u2018Do I really need to be doing this every day?\u2019 Once you\u2019ve gone through a period where you weren\u2019t commuting, and you were still getting your work done, suddenly that opens up as a question. Before it was taken for granted. \u2026 Now that feels like a choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just looking at that and saying, \u2018Why would I spend that time commuting?\u2019 Now when the company says, \u2018Come back into the office,\u2019 and you\u2019ve got an hourlong commute each way, it feels like the same, \u2018We want two more hours of your time.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Are the Pros and Cons of Remote Working?\u201d features management professor Martine Haas, who advises managers on how to get the most out of a hybrid workplace, while keeping the pros and cons of remote working in mind.\n\n\u201cI think there are two big components that feel important because they both create power differences between people who are in the office and people who are not,\u201d says Haas. \u201cOne is people\u2019s access to resources, whether it\u2019s the photocopier or support or advice from the manager or other workers. You have more of those resources if you\u2019re in the office with other people usually than if you\u2019re at home.\u201d\n\nThe other is visibility. If you\u2019re in the office, you probably have more visibility to your manager. Probably your manager is in the office, too. \u2026 Losses in visibility matter because there are bases of power in organizations. \u2026 I think managers need to start with that fundamental recognition that people are in different structural positions, and as a result, all is not equal.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cAre We Moving Towards a Four-day Workweek in the United States?,\u201d management professor Iwan Barankay looks at the four-day workweek as an appealing model for workers seeking work-life balance. But in practice, he thinks it\u2019s a problematic idea that won\u2019t take hold.\n\n\u201cI think people need to think carefully about what they miss out on or what they lose when they move to a four-day workweek, or when they are moving to subcontracting,\u201d says Barankay. \u201cI think a four-day workweek is an intermediate step to just outsourcing and subcontracting, and not for a better workplace environment.\u201d\n\nFor a full list of podcast episodes, visit the \u201cRipple Effect\u201d website."

This was in response to a 2022 clip post of Gary Gensler saying Ethereum (ETH) had transformed from a security to a non-security as it had become more decentralized.\n\nDeaton further questioned the chairman\u2019s competency saying that Gensler continues to ignore the fact that US Securities laws do not apply to the purchase of an asset for non-investment use cases.\n\nIn his tweet, Deaton highlighted that the Chairman might be seeing himself as someone above the law as he doesn\u2019t give a shit what the law says. Deaton concluded his tweet suggesting that Gary Gensler must go, to further express his disbelief in the chairman.\n\nIn June 2023, Congressman Warren Davidson also called for the chairman\u2019s removal calling Gary Gensler a \u201ctyrannical\u201d chairman. The Congressman claimed that the SEC\u2019s actions against the crypto industry are unjust and must be protected from Gensler.\n\nFeatured image from YouTube, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "Supreme Court flooding case could ripple across the energy sector - E&E News by POLITICO",
        "content": "Texas property owners flooded by Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda are headed to the Supreme Court to make their pitch for why they should be allowed to sue for compensation from the state.\n\nCourt watchers are closely following the case for how it could also affect the energy sector.\n\nRichard Devillier and other property owners sued the Lone Star State after their land flooded for days following the storms, allegedly as the result of a state-led highway elevation and expansion project. The revamped roadway was meant to create an evacuation route during emergencies, but the plaintiffs said it also prevented floodwaters from receding into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed Friday to hear their case, Richard Devillier v. Texas, which centers on the process for how the challengers could get help from the judicial system. According to the petition\u2019s backers, the high court\u2019s ruling could have implications for cases where the use of land for a public good damages private property. These so-called inverse condemnation challenges can include suits against utilities operating outside their easements, or those allegedly at fault for sparking wildfires.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision to hear the Devillier case comes after a concerted effort in recent years to convince the court to address procedural maneuvers that have made it challenging for property owners to bring their claims to court, said Robert Thomas, director of property rights litigation at the Pacific Legal Foundation. The nonprofit is among the groups that has asked the court to address takings cases and has lent its support for the property owners in Devillier in a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gamesmanship going on trying to avoid getting to the actual core question \u2014 is compensation owed for the take?\u201d Thomas told E&E News. \u201cYou will see local governments, and often the federal government, interposing these procedural defenses to move the chess pieces around.\u201d\n\nThis case is an example of how court procedure is being used to stymie damage claims from property owners, he added.\n\nTexas, meanwhile, has fought the property owners\u2019 claims for compensation, saying it was immune from the lawsuit, and in the case of Harvey, the challenge came too long after the 2017 storm that wreaked havoc on the state.\n\n\u201cThe petition does not warrant this Court\u2019s attention,\u201d the state attorney general\u2019s office said in a brief to the high court.\n\nRobert McNamara, an attorney for the property owners, said his clients are heading to court to challenge a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that found property owners could only sue for damages if Congress passed a law allowing it.\n\nThe 5th Circuit decision \u201ctransforms\u201d the rights to repayment laid out in the takings clause of the 5th Amendment of the Constitution, which holds that if the government takes private property to build something for the public good, it has to pay \u201cjust compensation,\u201d said McNamara, deputy litigation director at the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit law firm.\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get to sue for just compensation unless the legislature has given you the right to sue,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 5th Circuit \u201chas turned the federal courts from the place where citizens can go for redress of their federal rights to the place the government gets to go to extinguish your federal constitutional rights, which is just exactly backwards,\u201d McNamara said.\n\nThe type of takings case before the high court is the flip side of challenges where the government has authorized condemnation, like in most cases when utilities are building new projects.\n\nIn inverse condemnations, the government does not exercise eminent domain but does something else \u2014 in this case, elevating a highway \u2014 and in the process of taking that action \u201cthat results in something that, from the [property] owner\u2019s perspective, kind of looks like eminent domain,\u201d said Thomas.\n\nThe outcome of this case could be relevant in the circumstances where a utility has exceeded its easement or a property owner has sued a utility to pay for using land that it hasn\u2019t previously paid for, McNamara said.\n\n\u201cIf the Fifth Circuit ruling stands, state-owned utilities just wouldn\u2019t have to pay as a matter of law,\u201d McNamara said in an email.\n\nThomas said that the case could also be relevant for another type of inverse condemnation case that has gained some traction in California courts \u2014 where utilities are sued for damages from wildfires associated with their power lines. In some courts, judges have found utilities liable for wildfires if they are providing public power, while others have said property owners can only bring a takings challenge when the utility has eminent domain power.\n\nThe ruling could also potentially impact how eminent domain lawsuits, like those filed against pipeline or transmission line construction, move forward, as those types of cases are also mired in similar procedural disputes, Thomas said.\n\nHe pointed specifically to the issue of a \u201cquick take,\u201d where companies can begin to build a project on condemned land before paying the property owners. Virginia residents in the path of the Mountain Valley pipeline had sought to challenge that process, but the Supreme Court rejected their petition in 2019 and has not resolved the legal question.\n\n\u2018Significant ramifications\u2019\n\nThe property owners in Devillier argued that during the storms in 2017 and 2019, a concrete barrier between the east and westbound lanes of Interstate 10 in East Texas served as a dam blocking floodwaters from moving into the southern lanes. This resulted in flooding on their property north of the highway.\n\nIn Devillier\u2019s case, his family\u2019s ranch was so badly flooded that livestock were left in neck-deep water for four days, according to McNamara.\n\nDevillier and other property owners had first brought their challenge under the takings clauses in the United States and Texas constitutions to state court, before Texas successfully shifted the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, where it was consolidated with other cases into a single lawsuit including 77 property owners.\n\nIn response, Texas said that it was necessary that Congress authorize a lawsuit. These types of statutes authorizing litigation against the government exist in other takings litigation and civil rights law, said Thomas, though he contested the state\u2019s claim that a similar requirement exists in this circumstance.\n\nThe district court dismissed the landowners\u2019 case in 2021, and the 5th Circuit upheld the lower court ruling in a short decision last year.\n\nThe Texas attorney general\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on the court\u2019s decision to grant the case. In its brief to the Supreme Court, Texas claimed the case had arrived before the justices too soon.\n\nThe high court only allowed takings claims to come to federal courts first four years ago in its ruling in Knick v. Township of Scott, the state\u2019s top attorney said. In that case, the Supreme Court justices ruled in a 5-4 decision to undo long-standing precedent requiring that takings claims be raised first in state court before being raised in federal court.\n\nSo \u201cthere has been very little time for lower courts to consider the relevant issue of whether the Constitution creates a cause of action that may be pursued in federal court,\u201d John Scott (R), Texas\u2019 provisional attorney general at the time, said in a brief to the high court this summer.\n\nAttorneys for the Cato Institute, which also backed the landowners in a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief to the Supreme Court, said the 5th Circuit ruling effectively undid the Supreme Court\u2019s 2019 finding that the requirement to first bring a takings case to state court before raising a federal challenge created a \u201cCatch-22.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because, if the challengers lost their case in state court, they were barred from bringing their suit to federal court.\n\nThe decision \u201cdemonstrates at best a massive oversight of this Court\u2019s precedents and at worst an egregious resistance of them,\u201d attorneys for the Cato Institute said.\n\n\u201cThese significant ramifications of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling render the question presented extremely important,\u201d they said.\n\nThis story also appears in Climatewire."
