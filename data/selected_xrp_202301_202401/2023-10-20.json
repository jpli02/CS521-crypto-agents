The judge granted the SEC to file an interlocutory appeal until Aug. 18. Interlocutory appeals occur before all claims to both parties are resolved and are only allowed under specific circumstances.\n\nEarlier this month, Judge Analisa Tores rejected the agency\u2019s interlocutory motion to overturn her ruling.\n\nIn December 2020, the SEC sued the San Francisco-based technology firm and its executives alleging that Ripple\u2019s sale of XRP was an unregistered securities offering.\n\nThe XRP token rose 6.49% in the 24 hours leading up to 4:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, to trade at US$0.512, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nSee related article: Valkyrie CIO expects US spot Bitcoin ETF approval in Q2 2024"
