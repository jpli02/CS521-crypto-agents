        "title": "Ripple CTO Shares Email That Started It All - U.Today",
        "content": "In a recent tweet, Ripple CTO David Schwartz shared the email exchange that ultimately led to him being hired by Jed McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple and Stellar. The architect behind the XRP Ledger published the email on Feb. 24 on this Twitter profile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe email, dated Sept. 17, 2011, is a job application for the position of lead software engineer.\n\nIn the email, Schwartz expresses his interest in the position and highlights his expertise in cryptocurrencies and decades of development experience.\n\nHe also mentions his involvement in the Bitcoin community and his work on a Bitcoin successor. In another tweet, Schwartz said the project would have been closest to FileCoin, which is a decentralized storage network. However, he noted that the idea was in very early conceptual stages back then.\n\nMcCaleb responded to the email the following day, expressing his interest in meeting Schwartz to discuss the position further. \"Yes, I've seen your posts on the forum. Your resume looks perfect for the job. We'd like to meet you to talk about it more. Do you ever come over to the bay area?\" he wrote.\n\nThe exchange, which took place in September 2011, ultimately led to Schwartz being hired as the lead software engineer for Ripple. He would later be promoted to chief cryptographer, and eventually, CTO.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Schwartz recently confirmed that he had no plans to leave the San Francisco-based company. While he has expressed interest in starting a new project from scratch, he does not want to make a perfunctory effort and does not have the passion necessary to kick off a new major project on his own."

        "content": "The spread of March PS Plus games has been revealed! Those with a Plus Plus Essential subscription will be able to download Battlefield 2024, Code Vein, and Minecraft Dungeons for free starting March 7.\n\nThis was announced during the PlayStation Stay of Play in a fast-paced gameplay montage. The show also featured several new reveals, including a vast selection of new games coming to the PS Plus catalogue. If you\u2019re keen on downloading the new PS Plus monthly games, you have until April 3 to do so.\n\nYou can watch the trailer for Battlefield 2042 season 3 here!\n\nFirst up comes Battlefield 2042, a game with a troubled launch and numerous issues that have since been addressed with patches and major content overhauls in the months since. It now has classes, and the maps flow a little better than before, but it\u2019s still got a way to go. Nonetheless, if you\u2019ve avoided the game and are curious as to how it feels these days, a free download won\u2019t hurt you too badly, will it?\n\nThen there\u2019s Minecraft dungeons, which brings the blocky crafting-heavy game to a whole new dimension with a top-down action-adventure twist. It has up to four-player co-op, a bunch of different gear pieces you can use to alter our playstyle and a good amount of character customisation too. We found it decent enough back at launch, but with new content having been released since then, maybe it\u2019s worth another go.\n\nFinally there is Code Vein, an anime vampire souls like with fast movement and a unique world filled with dark wonder and mystery abound. It\u2019s got probably one of the most elaborate character customisation systems in the genre, and a blood-sucking narrative to go alongside it. We thought it was okay in our review, but it\u2019s well worth trying if you\u2019ve got the time.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a pretty standard selection of PS Plus games this March. Let us know what you think of these three below, and if you\u2019re planning on downloading any of them.\n\nFor more PS Plus pieces, check out our articles on the 30 best PS Plus games, as well as our full list of all PS Plus games here!"

        "content": "David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer at Ripple Labs has once again dropped a hot take on the ongoing XRP lawsuit involving the United States SEC and Ripple.\n\nThis time around, Schwartz posted a cryptic message, divulging how the Silicon Valley tech company is surviving amid the longstanding heated court battle where the SEC contends that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security.\n\nAlso, the Ripple CEO implied that Ripple is at a crossroads as the company is faced with the decision of pursuing its vision or doing what needs to be done for survival.\n\nReferring to Ripple, Swchartz wrote, \u201cWhen a scrappy financial startup takes on a web of corruption and betrayal to bring instant payments to the masses, they learn that the cost of disrupting the status quo is higher than they could ever have imagined, forcing them to decide between their vision and their survival.\u201d\n\nNotably, Ripple has been fighting with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for more than two years over the classification of the XRP token. The XRP lawsuit began in December 2020.\n\nConsidering recent comments made by Ripple General Counsel Stuart Alderoty and Attorney John Deaton, the case may not be concluded by mid-2023 as earlier speculated by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nThe SEC claims XRP is a security but Ripple contends that XRP\u2019s purpose would be impaired if it is labeled a security when its functionality, liquidity, and distribution shows outright incompatible with securities requirements.\n\nBeyond proving that XRP is not a security as claimed by the SEC, Ripple noted that they are fighting for the good of the entire crypto industry. A win for Ripple would compel the financial regulators to issue clear regulations for the emerging industry.\n\n<\n\nIn turn, this would foster development in the crypto industry while causing blockchain developers to continue operating in the United States, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said when he criticized the securities watchdog for attacking Kraken and threatening Paxos with a lawsuit over BUSD.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"

        "title": "Alec Baldwin Pleads Not Guilty in 'Rust' Shooting - Rolling Stone",
        "content": "Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter in connection to the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film Rust in 2021.\n\nBaldwin entered his plea on Thursday, waiving his right to a first appearance in court, according to documents obtained by Rolling Stone. The actor remains free without having to post a bond.\n\nHe faces up to 18 months in prison if convicted of the involuntary manslaughter charge. Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who supplied the weapons on the set of the independent film, was also charged with involuntary manslaughter. On Friday, Feb. 24, she also pleaded not guilty.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Gutierrez-Reed\u2019s appearance included a back-and-forth over whether she should be allowed to keep a gun in her home as part of the conditions of her release. Gutierrez-Reed\u2019s lawyer said she\u2019d received numerous theats and had to file for a restraining order against a stalker. Her lawyer also said the court failed to properly redact some of Gutierrez-Reed\u2019s personal information (like her phone number) when releasing court documents related to the ongoing case.\n\nIn turn, the DA objected to the gun request because of Gutierrez-Reed\u2019s \u201csloppy mishandling of firearms and guns\u201d on the Rust set. Ultimately, however, the judge ruled that Gutierrez-Reed could keep a gun at home for self defense. He also ordered that she not have any contact with witnesses who might testify during the case.\n\nEarlier this week, New Mexico prosecutors dropped a firearm enhancement charge that could have added five years to each sentence. Attorneys for both Baldwin and Guttierez-Reed had argued that they had been incorrectly charged with manslaughter under a New Mexico firearm law that had actually been passed months after the shooting took place. A lawyer for Gutierrez-Reed told the New York Times that the updated charges \u201creflected good ethical standards and was correct on the facts and law.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to the New York Times, Heather Brewer, a representative for the district attorney, said it had downgraded the charges to \u201cavoid further litigious distractions by Mr. Baldwin and his attorneys.\u201d\n\nHutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was wounded during a rehearsal on the set of Rust on Oct. 21, 2021. The incident occurred when Baldwin inadvertently discharged a prop gun that had been loaded with a live round, believing the prop had been \u201ccold.\u201d There have been numerous investigations into the incident by various government agencies, from the Santa Fe Sheriff\u2019s Office to the FBI. Trending Trump Rails Against Broken Rally Teleprompters, Threatens to Stiff Contractors MTG Says Trump Is a 'Convicted Felon' Just Like Jesus Gypsy Rose Blanchard Sues True Crime Content Creator for Defamation and Fraud See Courteney Cox Reenact Moves From Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u2018Dancing in the Dark\u2019 Video\n\nThe shooting has prompted several civil lawsuits (as well as some fines). Most notably, Hutchins\u2019 family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Baldwin, Rust producer Ryan Donnell Smith, Gutierrez-Reed, assistant director Dave Halls, prop master Sarah Zachary, and \u201carmorer mentor\u201d Seth Kenney.\n\nThis story was updated 2/24/23 @ 2:24 p.m. ET with Hannah Gutierrez-Reed\u2019s plea."

Metacade (MCADE) \u2013 The best P2E crypto penny stock\n\nMetacade, currently in its crypto presale event, is quickly establishing itself as one of the best crypto penny stocks to buy in 2023.

Tron (TRX) \u2013 Scalable blockchain solution available for pennies\n\nTron has long been established as one of the best layer-1 blockchain providers thanks to its versatile and scalable solutions, providing a compelling alternative to market leader Ethereum. Released in 2017 with the aim of decentralizing entertainment, content-sharing, and gaming, this highly-scalable blockchain has proved itself able to support high transaction throughput at lightning-fast speeds, often confirming within 3 seconds.\n\nDevelopers can use the platform to support a vast range of decentralized apps (dApps). This is enabled through the platform\u2019s Tron Virtual Machine (TVM), which provides smart contract support and easy, cheap transactions.\n\nAt the core of Tron\u2019s quest to decentralize the web is their belief that web users should control who sees their private data, rather than having it automatically mined by big tech companies such as Meta and Google. With growing unease around big tech use of personal data, this is a truly compelling use case for Tron.\n\nWhy buy TRX?\n\nTron\u2019s network is regularly used as one of the fastest and cheapest ways to transact global cryptocurrency transfers. Its high liquidity enables the platform\u2019s excellent scalability, leading to its impressive 2000 transactions-per-second (TPS) capacity without compromising performance.\n\nTRX was valued at $0.18 at the peak of 2021\u2019s bull market was considerably higher than its current value of $0.062. With a dedicated user base trusting Tron as a reliable blockchain provider that consistently delivers fast transactions, TRX is one of the best crypto penny stocks to buy now.\n\n6. Algorand (ALGO) \u2013 Proof-of-stake blockchain popular with dApp developers\n\nAlgorand is a blockchain that offers a permissionless, proof-of-stake (PoS) smart chain consensus that supports the development of dApps. It is designed to be secure, scalable, and fast, ensuring that all those participating in the network have equal influence.\n\nThe PoS consensus protocol enables total decentralization, with each node having equal authority. This allows maximum security across Algorand\u2019s entire network and promotes full transparency, as transactions are conducted at high speed and low cost.\n\nAlgorand\u2019s outstanding combination of excellent scalability alongside high transaction speed is the feature that makes it stand out from many of its Web3 competitors. Their stated aim is to help create a future where individuals have the tools to fully realized digital asset ownership and interact seamlessly with other web users online.\n\nWhy buy ALGO?\n\nThree traditional issues tend to dog blockchain providers, yet Algorand\u2019s platform has solved this infamous trio of problems. It has previously been stated that a distributed network must sacrifice either scalability, decentralization, or security to function. Algorand has achieved a network that sacrifices none of these essential functions, providing support to millions of users.\n\nCurrently available at $0.246, ALGO is one of the best crypto penny stocks presently available, with enormous potential to grow as its market-leading capability becomes known. This makes it a coin worth investing in now, with rich dividends potentially on offer for anyone who takes advantage of this current low price.\n\n7. Ripple (XRP) \u2013 Enabling lightning-fast international transfers\n\nRipple aims to revolutionize the financial services industry by offering a compelling alternative to the costly and cumbersome SWIFT global payments system. With outstanding results, Ripple\u2019s alternative has been trialed by several leading international financial behemoths, including the Bank of England, Bank of America, and Santander.\n\nRipple offers the same service as the SWIFT system but costs less than $0.01 per transaction and competing transfers within seconds. Widespread adoption of Ripple\u2019s solution has been held back by a widely-publicized legal challenge to the legality of their native XRP token by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nHowever, this hasn\u2019t stopped some of the world\u2019s most prominent financial institutions, including Coinbase, and thousands of XRP coin holders from supporting the platform.\n\nWhy buy XRP?\n\nEncouraging investment in a currency currently embroiled in a legal dispute with American government bodies appears ridiculous. However, with a decision due in mid-2023 and many experts believing the verdict will exonerate Ripple, XRP\u2019s value will skyrocket the moment a favorable decision is granted.\n\nWith the continuing support of some of big finance\u2019s most trusted names, a revolutionary decentralized finance (DeFi) solution that delivers enormous benefits to individuals and companies conducting cross-border business, XRP\u2019s current value of $0.41 is unbelievable. This makes it one of the best crypto penny stocks to buy now, with potentially huge dividends to investors.\n\n8. VeChain (VET) \u2013 Logistics solution with eco-sustainable motives\n\nOne of the questions that have dogged cryptocurrencies since their establishment more than a decade ago has been around energy efficiency and sustainability. VeChain is a blockchain network aiming to increase transparency and efficiency in logistic supply chains and, more recently, provide SaaS support for companies and governments in meeting net-zero targets.\n\nSeveral big companies, including BMW, Renault, Vauxhall, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and Walmart (China), have begun to adopt VeChain\u2019s supply chain solutions, demonstrating the platform\u2019s real-world viability and value.\n\nMeanwhile, VeChain\u2019s new carbon-neutral CO2 emission-management platform (VeCarbon) launched in 2022 and is already beginning to deliver benefits to those looking to understand their current carbon footprint and how to reduce it.\n\nWhy buy VET?\n\nVeChain\u2019s native VET coin is currently trading at $0.234. It will likely gain significant traction over the coming months and years as more countries and nations look for valuable solutions that deliver tangible benefits.\n\nVeChain\u2019s multi-use case, delivering on improving visibility and security throughout the supply-chain process, and reducing the risk of theft and fraud, is proven. Meanwhile, their move into carbon management suggests an incredibly bright future for the VET coin, making it one of the best crypto penny stocks to buy in 2023.\n\n9. Cronos (CRO) \u2013 Native coin of crypto exchange giant looks likely to grow\n\nCronos (CRO) is the native coin of the crypto exchange Crypto.com, one of the biggest centralized crypto exchanges in the world. While Crypto.com\u2019s primary mechanism is focused on trading cryptocurrencies, offering CRO coin holders access to reduced transaction fees and a range of special offers, the platform\u2019s toolkit extends much deeper into the world of crypto trading.\n\nCronos leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate faster transactions and lower costs. Meanwhile, the cutting-edge technology enabled by the CRO coin provides users with access to quick and easy management of their portfolios and the ability to track investments across different exchanges, thus increasing the potential for profitable returns.\n\nWhy buy CRO?\n\nThe collapse of the FTX exchange in late 2022 has opened up a massive gap in the market for other exchanges to try and challenge the market leader, Binance. Crypto.com looks exceptionally well placed to lead the charge with its wide-ranging and compelling range of features.\n\nThe CRO coin is currently valued at $0.079, which looks very low for a currency that offers such rich utility, a vast user base, and a compelling existing catalog of features. Predictions are that CRO will rise significantly in value, particularly as Crypto.com positions itself as one of the main challengers to replace FTX, making it one of the best crypto penny stocks to buy right now.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.
