        "content": "Ripple, Stellar, and IOTA are leading in a push that will pave the way for cryptocurrencies to integrate with SWIFT.\n\nTheir ready-to-use technology for payments, regulatory embrace, and involvement with ISO 20022 paves the way for possible integration with SWIFT.\n\nThree cryptocurrencies are leading the way in the billion-dollar crypto market in integrating SWIFT. The traditional financial sector is increasingly looking to merge with the modernized cryptocurrency market whose influence is increasingly growing.\n\nRipple, Stellar, and IOTA have made themselves the favorite for the finance sector to work with because of their ready-to-use technology for payments and their efforts to work within the existing regulatory framework. Stellar and IOTA are working towards ISO 20022 which is an ISO standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions adopted across the world. Ripple has been a member of the body since 2020.\n\nAs CNF has reported, Ripple, XLM, and IOTA\u2019s involvement with ISO 20022 paves the way for possible integration with SWIFT.\n\nRead More: Breaking Barriers: Ripple\u2019s XRP, Stellar\u2019s XLM, and IOTA Pave the Way with Possible SWIFT Integration, Dominating the Billion-Dollar Crypto Market\n\nAccording to Stephen Lindsay, the business lead for Swift\u2019s strategic platform, the emergence of ISO 20022 has addressed some challenges including inefficiencies and increased costs developed by the old format of payment.\n\nWhen it comes to payments, it\u2019s no different. When money moves across borders, we rarely think about the layers of communication before payment is executed. Over time, formats used for payments messages in different regions have developed idiosyncrasies requiring translation, creating bottlenecks that cause inefficiencies and increased costs.\n\nWhy Ripple, Stellar, and IOTA Lead in SWIFT Integration\n\nThe three crypto heavyweights are not only paving the way for their regulatory compliance and superior technology. The three have also taken a unique approach to solving real-world problems using their respective technologies.\n\nRipple has been pushing to succeed as a foremost blockchain payments firm targeting untapped markets such as in the Middle East, South America, and Africa to offer a real-time settlement of international payments. For the most part, this is achieved through strategic partnerships with local firms. The network is bringing financial inclusion in marginalized regions, promoting international settlements with speed and low fees, and facilitating payments.\n\nStellar on the other hand is looking into similar regions with the aim of banking the unbanked. While Ripple is focused on business-to-business transactions, Stellar solves the primary issues of the unbanked population. Recently, Moneygram executives hailed Stellar as the blockchain for payments.\n\nFinally, IOTA offers a unique solution to the problem of scalability within the industry. Its protocol allows for secure, feeless transactions between devices on the Internet of Things (IoT) paving the way for a new era of machine-to-machine transactions.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nRipple vs. SEC lawsuit draws closer to a verdict, and market watchers predict a surge in XRP price to $10 if Ripple wins. Adding to the excitement is a former SEC director who supports this expectation.\n\nWill the Ripple-SEC case conclude in days?\n\nRipple\u2019s ongoing battle with the SEC will end soon, says a former SEC regional director and enforcement attorney.\n\nMore than two years in the making, the SEC-Ripple case is about to end.\n\nFormer Regional Director Marc Fagel of the San Francisco Regional Office of the SEC, told me a judge would rule on the XRP lawsuit soon. In response to a tweet, Fagel questioned the judge\u2019s impartiality after the SEC withdrew its lawsuits before summary judgment.\n\nAdditionally, the tweet said delaying the verdict could create further confusion and reinforce the perception that public relations influenced the judge.\n\nFagel said a court decision in the Ripple case may be coming soon, without speculating. Rather than any hidden motives, he thought any further delay would be caused by the complexities of the case.\n\nIn late 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and chairman Chris Larsen. By selling XRP, unregistered security, they illegally raised over $1.2 billion.\n\nXRP community members were shocked by William Hinman\u2019s recent materials. Legal counsel for Ripple argued that Hinman\u2019s statement in 2018 that Ether, the token of Ethereum, was not a security created confusion and led Ripple and others to believe that XRP was similarly not a security as well.\n\nFagel highlighted the differences between Ripple\u2019s case and other recent actions taken by the SEC. In his opinion, the judge is unlikely to discuss the Hinman documents or the secondary market trading issue. Nevertheless, the emails may be considered when determining the defendant\u2019s liability.\n\nXRP Attorney Highlights Ripple Lawsuit Mistake; Will XRP Surge to $10?\n\nOn Twitter, XRP holders\u2019 lawyer John Deaton reminded everyone that charging individual executives with aiding and abetting in the lawsuit was a bad idea. He says neither Ripple executive would be considered reckless by a fair jury.\n\nIn addition to XRP, the SEC\u2019s intense battle with Ripple has huge implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently said all cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin, should be classified as securities.\n\nThe Commission intends to examine and regulate more crypto assets closely. The loss of the case would negatively impact cryptocurrency adoption, empower the SEC to take similar legal action, create instability in the market, and make ambitious crypto startups look elsewhere for better regulatory environments.\n\nEarly this month, Deaton said there was only a 3% chance that District Judge Analisa Torres would rule in the SEC\u2019s favor.\n\nAs a result, Ripple\u2019s win would increase trust and belief in cryptocurrencies, opening doors to new investments. In such a scenario, Deaton thinks Ripple\u2019s XRP could skyrocket to $10 or higher.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market could get a big boost from this for Ripple. XRP would get a huge boost in value as investors flock to it."
