        "content": "Ripple, in a Sept. 1 court filing, rebuts a regulatory assertion that XRP lacks intrinsic value, emphasizing its role as a bridge virtual asset.\n\nIn the ongoing legal showdown with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple has challenged the agency\u2019s claim that XRP is nothing more than a piece of computer code. Contrary to the interpretation by the regulatory watchdog, Ripple affirms that the court did not make such a ruling.\n\nThis clarification sheds new light on the XRP debate. Ripple\u2019s legal team emphasized that XRP serves as a vital bridge virtual asset, facilitating seamless cross-border transactions.\n\nYou might also like: Pakistan\u2019s state bank highlights Ripple\u2019s XRP potential\n\nIn its previous ruling, the court \u201cfound that an XRP token is not, in itself, an investment contract because it does not meet Howey\u2019s requirements.\u201d This clarification underscores the unique nature of XRP within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nRipple is not merely defending its position, but is gearing up for counter-appeals if the SEC\u2019s request for an interim appeal is granted.\n\nOne of the key issues Ripple intends to address is the classification of XRP as an investment contract concerning institutional sales. Ripple is committed to contesting the SEC\u2019s attempts to categorize post-lawsuit XRP sales to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) customers.\n\nYou might also like: Singapore regulator seeks input from Ripple and Circle on stablecoin regulation\n\nRipple\u2019s victory celebration\n\nAs the legal battle rages on, Ripple has decided to celebrate its partial legal victory with its supporters. On Sept. 29, Ripple will host a celebration in New York.\n\nThis announcement comes in the wake of the recent favorable ruling, which concluded that XRP is not an unregistered security except when it is employed to raise funds from institutions.\n\nIn a related development, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is taking proactive measures to bolster his legal defense.\n\nTwo attorneys from the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP are advising Garlinghouse\u2019s case. This move underscores the significance of the legal battle and Ripple\u2019s commitment to protecting its interests."

In particular, he referenced a section where Ripple countered the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s claim that XRP has no intrinsic value.\n\nPro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan shared parts of the content of Ripple\u2019s reply with the XRP community.\n\nMy favorite too. I have being banging on about the SEC comment that XRP has no inherent value all week. Glad the Ripple attorneys addressed it. No such finding by the judge, not relevant to the Howey test anyway, and irrelevant to whether XRP use gives it value, which it does. https://t.co/tAOuYPspfp pic.twitter.com/Yz7EVpj5oX \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) September 2, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRipple Counters SEC\u2019s Claim\n\nRecall that the regulator argued that XRP was merely a computer code in its motion seeking interlocutory appeal. The SEC claimed it was not seeking permission to appeal that XRP was a software code with no intrinsic value.\n\nMeanwhile, in the reply filing, Ripple argued the SEC was greatly mistaken. Ripple reaffirmed that the US court did not rule that XRP has no inherent value.\n\n\u201cThe Court made no such ruling,\u201d Ripple legal team proclaimed.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMoreover, the payment firm went on to clarify that XRP is a bridge virtual asset for facilitating intercontinental transactions.

Among the rulings Ripple intends to review is the judgment related to institutional sales of XRP.\n\nSpecifically, the blockchain fintech company will appeal the decision classifying XRP as an investment contract in the context of institutional sales.\n\nAlso, Ripple has stated its commitment to defending efforts by the SEC to classify post-lawsuit sales of XRP to ODL customers."

        "content": "Ripple\u2019s strategic direction with the XRP token has historically always been a subject of intense scrutiny and discussion. Recent developments suggest a potential pivot in Ripple\u2019s long-term vision for XRP.\n\nHistorically, the company\u2019s ambition for XRP was grand. Statements from six years ago, recently unearthed by the XRP community, reveal Ripple\u2019s aspiration to position XRP as a world reserve currency. In both an unearthed blog post by the fintech and a speech from CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the company laid out its vision for XRP.\n\n$XRP \ud83d\udd00 | \ud83c\udf0e RESERVE CURRENCY We didn\u2019t make this up. Since the beginning @Ripple has stated $XRP is set to become the World\u2019s Reserve Currency. \ud83c\udfe6 \u2014 XRP \u2014 \ud83c\udfe6 Brad Garlinghouse confirms it \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb pic.twitter.com/5CbV2i26G0 \u2014 EDO FARINA \ud83c\udd67 XRP (@edward_farina) September 2, 2023\n\nHas Ripple Shifted Its Focus?\n\nHowever, this narrative seems to be undergoing a transformation. Prominent XRP influencer, Crypto Eri, weighed in on the matter, stating, \u201cRipple had already sidestepped the narrative of XRP becoming a reserve currency. They haven\u2019t broached that topic in recent years.\u201d She further referred to recent comments by CTO David Schwartz who stated that the fintech is talking to banks and large financial institutions to bring stable coins to their yet to be released proprietary DEX integrated in On-Demand Liquidity (ODL).\n\nThus, the focus appears to be shifting towards the integration of stablecoins on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the potential utilization of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in Ripple\u2019s ODL service. Schwartz also provided insights into the company\u2019s current trajectory. \u201cDecentralized exchanges are not presently integrated into ODL,\u201d Schwartz clarified. However, he emphasized the ongoing explorations to incorporate DEX services, which would \u201cenable trading against automated market makers (AMMs).\u201d\n\nSchwartz further elaborated on the capabilities of Prisma, an API related to ODL. \u201cPrisma can leverage the liquidity of multiple exchanges, including DEXs,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt can dissect substantial transactions into more manageable portions to optimize the utilization of liquidity.\u201d\n\nYet, a significant hurdle remains. Schwartz pointed out the necessity of stablecoins in major currencies, such as the US dollar or Euro, for the practical implementation of these plans. \u201cWe had neared an opportunity to integrate stablecoin functionality onto XRPL,\u201d Schwartz revealed. However, he lamented that the SEC lawsuit against Ripple two and a half years ago \u201ctorpedoed that deal.\u201d\n\nDespite these challenges, Ripple\u2019s commitment to innovation remains undeterred. Schwartz confirmed that the company is actively \u201cengaging top financial institutions about launching stablecoins to make the DEX integration more practical.\u201d\n\nAs the crypto landscape continues to evolve, Ripple\u2019s strategic shifts underscore the dynamic nature of the industry and the need for adaptability. Whether XRP\u2019s role as a reserve currency is truly in the rearview, or if it\u2019s merely taking a backseat to more immediate technological advancements, remains to be seen.\n\nAt press time, XRP traded at $0.5013.\n\nFeatured image from Zipmex, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Ripple Foods\u2019 product line includes protein shakes, soft serve ice cream and non-dairy milk products. All of them are based on Ripptein, a proprietary pea protein isolate made from yellow peas.\n\nRipple Kids Milk, launched in 2021, quickly proved to be one of the company\u2019s most popular products. By 2022 the demand for the new product created a challenge for the R&D department: How could the company ramp up production of Ripptein while maintaining quality?\n\n\u201cWhen you scale the process, you\u2019re making so much more of it than what you did before, and the things like the flavor and the functionality weren\u2019t being consistently met as we scaled,\u201d Seaberg says. \u201cSo we needed to refine that and hammer that out so we can have an ingredient going into our product that we can have confidence in, not only for the launch, but for our ongoing needs.\u201d\n\nExactly how the R&D team succeeded at scaling up the production is proprietary, but the result was a steady supply that met demand.\n\n\u201cWe were able to meet that goal, so we\u2019re able to replicate the product on a huge scale and enable the product pipeline,\u201d Seaberg says.\n\nThe next challenge of 2022 was creating a sugar-free version of Kids Milk. The company listens closely to what its customers want \u2013 its consumer response team consistently monitors feedback from buyers \u2013 and heard that sugar-free Kids Milk was something they wanted. Meeting that demand involved creating a recipe that tapped the best flavors of the proteins without the benefit of sugar.\n\n\u201cWhen you have an unsweetened product, it showcases all the ingredients you have in there,\u201d Seaberg says. \u201cWe know we\u2019re the best ones out there when it comes to making really clean protein and combining it with dairy-free flavors to create a product that consumers love. That\u2019s our sweet spot, and this unsweetened product is a showcase of that. It really shows the value of our intellectual property.\u201d\n\nThe challenges Ripple\u2019s R&D team overcame to scale up production of the key protein ingredient and create the sugar-free version of Kids Milk were overshadowed by a totally different situation: When Russia attacked Ukraine, the world supply of two important ingredients needed by Ripple Foods crashed. When that happened, the company\u2019s R&D team sprang into action.\n\nThe Apollo 13 moment\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge we had in 2022 was to make sure we can keep our products on the shelf, which, for a small company like Ripple, is huge, because we are growing our business,\u201d Seaberg explains. \u201cAnd if we don't have products on the shelf at all, that could risk shutting down Ripple Foods.\n\n\u201cThe war that is happening in Ukraine is just horrible on many fronts. But from a business perspective, it could have been really catastrophic for Ripple, if R&D couldn't find a solution for some of the key ingredients we use across our entire portfolio products, most notably, sunflower oil, as well as sunflower lecithin.\u201d\n\nThe R&D team considered a variety of oils as a replacement for sunflower oil, including safflower oil, canola oil, palm oil and corn oil. They had to find something that worked well in the existing formulations for Ripple products \u2013 oils are not always interchangeable. Furthermore, because Ripple positions itself as a creator of healthy products, the oil they chose to replace sunflower oil could not have dramatically worse nutrition characteristics. This ruled out palm oil, for example, because it is higher in saturated fat."
