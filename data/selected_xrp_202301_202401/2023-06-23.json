        "title": "Crypto Price Analysis Jun-23: ETH, XRP, ADA, DOGE, and SHIB - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nBulls took over the price action this week, and Ethereum booked an impressive 12.6% increase in price. The momentum shifted bullish in a matter of days, and now the expectation is for the price to continue up.\n\nEthereum found good support at $1,660, which acted as a pivot for the current rally. In the process, the resistance at $1,820 turned into support, and the next targets for this cryptocurrency are found at $2,000 and $2,100.\n\nLooking ahead, ETH has a good opportunity to recover most of the losses since April and re-test the key resistance at $2,100, if buyers are successful here.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nRipple showed a lot of strength when most altcoins were in red, but once the overall market turned bullish, it failed to capitalize on this sentiment. For this reason, XRP booked only a 3% price increase this week.\n\nThe biggest obstacle for this cryptocurrency right now is the key resistance at 53 cents which so far has managed to stop buyers from taking the price higher. Nevertheless, with volatility increasing, there could be more attempts at a breakout soon.\n\nLooking ahead, XRP appears to be consolidating under the key resistance, and in case of any pullback, the key support at 44 cents should do a good job of stopping sellers.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano has finally managed to put an end to its long downtrend after finding strong support at 24 cents. The price rallied in sync with the rest of the market and booked a 12.2% increase in price which is similar to Ethereum.\n\nSentiment around ADA is turning bullish, especially since buyers have managed to push the price to 30 cents. The biggest question now is if bulls can keep the price at this key level, as any weakness may turn this level into a resistance.\n\nLooking ahead, ADA is well placed to move higher, but this could depend on the overall market movements. Keep a close eye on Ethereum for a signal on where the market will move next, as Cardano might follow closely.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nDogecoin turned bullish as well this week and managed to book a 7.7% price increase. This has stopped the bearish momentum and given bulls much-needed relief. The current support is at 6.5 cents, and the key resistance is at 7.3 cents.\n\nWhile the momentum indicators have turned bullish, it is too early to tell if this will be a sustained rally or just a temporary relief. So long the key resistance holds, sellers could return to push the price lower again.\n\nLooking ahead, Dogecoin has to do its best to protect the key support level at 6.5 cents, as any weakness is likely to be quickly exploited by bears which have dominated for most of June.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nSHIB made an impressive recovery from its support at $0.0000065 and booked a 16.3% price increase this week, making it the best performer on our list.\n\nThe current resistance is at $0.0000078, and sellers appear to be holding the price at this level after pushing down any attempt at a breakout. Nevertheless, buyers still appear eager to move Shiba Inu higher.\n\nLooking ahead, this is the first time this cryptocurrency managed to rally in a significant way since February. The challenge for buyers is to sustain this momentum which proved difficult in the past."

        "title": "Opinion: The downtown Red Deer ripple effect - Red Deer Advocate",
        "content": "Downtown areas serve as the heart and soul of cities, and Red Deer, Alberta, is no exception. With its unique charm, historical significance, and economic potential, downtown Red Deer is a vital hub for commerce, culture, and community engagement. However, the perpetuation of negative rhetoric surrounding this vibrant district has hindered its growth and potential.\n\nDowntown areas serve as the heart and soul of cities, and Red Deer, Alberta, is no exception. With its unique charm, historical significance, and economic potential, downtown Red Deer is a vital hub for commerce, culture, and community engagement. However, the perpetuation of negative rhetoric surrounding this vibrant district has hindered its growth and potential. This post aims to shed light on the detrimental effects of perpetuating negative rhetoric about downtown Red Deer and emphasizes the importance of fostering a positive narrative to revitalize and support this crucial urban space.\n\n1. Economic Consequences:\n\nNegative rhetoric surrounding downtown Red Deer can have severe economic consequences. When potential investors, businesses, and residents constantly hear about crime, decline, or unfavorable conditions, it creates a perception that deters them from engaging in the downtown area. This perception results in reduced economic activity, discourages entrepreneurship, and limits job opportunities. Consequently, local businesses suffer, property values decline, and the potential for economic growth diminishes. It\u2019s also worth noting that the downtown is the most significant contributor to the City of Red Deer\u2019s total annual operating budget.\n\n2. Stifling Community Development:\n\nDowntown Red Deer is more than just a commercial district; it is a gathering place for the community. By perpetuating negative rhetoric, we hinder community development and cohesion. When people start avoiding downtown areas due to negative perceptions, foot traffic decreases, leading to lower participation in local events, diminished cultural experiences, and weakened community ties. Fostering a positive narrative is essential to bring people back to the heart of Red Deer, allowing the community to thrive and fostering a sense of belonging.\n\n3. Psychological Impact:\n\nNegative rhetoric about downtown Red Deer not only affects external perceptions but also shapes the mindset of residents, business owners, and visitors. When individuals constantly hear negative narratives about their own community, it can instill a sense of hopelessness, erode civic pride, and limit aspirations. This mindset can hinder progress and innovation, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy where negative perceptions become a reality. It is crucial to highlight the strengths, successes, and potential of downtown Red Deer to empower and inspire positive change.\n\n4. Missed Opportunities for Revitalization:\n\nDowntown Red Deer possesses immense potential for revitalization and transformation. By perpetuating negative rhetoric, we miss opportunities to unlock this potential. Positive change requires collective effort and belief in the value of downtown areas. By focusing solely on the challenges without recognizing the possibilities, we stifle creativity, innovation, and the motivation needed to revitalize the core of Red Deer. It is essential to highlight successful projects, ongoing efforts, and encourage investment to create a thriving and attractive downtown environment.\n\n5. Reinforcing Inequality:\n\nNegative rhetoric about downtown Red Deer can reinforce existing social and economic inequalities. Downtown areas often host a diverse population, including low-income residents and marginalized communities. When negative stereotypes and narratives dominate public discourse, it perpetuates stigmas, reinforces prejudice, and marginalizes these already vulnerable groups. To create a truly inclusive downtown, it is crucial to challenge stereotypes, promote inclusivity, and work towards equitable spaces that benefit all members of the Red Deer community.\n\nPerpetuating negative rhetoric about downtown Red Deer hampers its potential for economic growth, community development, and overall well-being. It is imperative to recognize the profound effects of this rhetoric and actively work towards shifting the narrative. By highlighting the strengths, celebrating successes, and fostering a sense of optimism, we can revitalize downtown Red Deer, attract investment, and cultivate a vibrant community. Let us embrace the power of positive rhetoric to transform downtown Red Deer into a thriving, inclusive, and prosperous space that truly represents the spirit of this remarkable city.\n\n\u201cIt takes a village\u201d, you can choose apathy, or you can help foster positive change by simply sharing your good stories. Words create worlds.\n\nBrandon Bouchard is the chair of the Red Deer Downtown Business Association and manager of Tribe restaurant and bar."
