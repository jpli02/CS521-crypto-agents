        "content": "North Wales businesses could benefit from the \"ripple effect\" of Liverpool hosting Eurovision, officials say.\n\nThe event is set to bring 100,000 people to Merseyside in May and much of the area's accommodation is booked up or expensive.\n\nOne Welsh hotel said it had seen a rise in bookings after promoting itself as a place to stay during the competition.\n\nThe Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) claimed there would be jobs for Welsh people too.\n\nBut the real opportunity lies in the \"long-term\" project of ensuring visitors to north-west England also spend time over the border, according to an expert on tourism marketing."

        "content": "XRP Lawsuit News: Ripple labs on Friday filed a letter in the US district court supporting its motion in the long running case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It mentioned that a recent Supreme Court case backs its Fair Notice Defense. However, the agency previously argued that the third parties\u2019 views stand irrelevant.\n\nWhy Ripple Filed The Letter?\n\nThe defendants asked Judge Analisa Torres to appraise the Supreme Court decision at the time of announcing the Summary Judgement in the XRP lawsuit.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAttorney John Deaton, Amicus Curiae in the Ripple Vs SEC case, stated that people speculating that the US SEC has the upper hand as Ripple is still looking to strengthen its position. However, the Supreme Court ruling in the other court came just four days ago.\n\nHe hinted that the Judge will be filing the decision in the XRP lawsuit in around 2 months and the Supreme Court ruling should be considered in the Summary Judgment as it is relevant for Ripple\u2019s Affirmative Defense. Read More XRP News Here\u2026\n\nWhat Will Court Decide?\n\nXRP Lawyer stated that the lack of Fair Notice violates the Due Process clause. However, the major reason behind this late submission revolves around Judge Torres\u2019s findings. If she observes that Ripple both offered and sold XRP as a security. Then this filed Supreme Court decision will provide Ripple\u2019s argument strength to stand.\n\nDeaton claimed that there is no doubt that Ripple will get the Summary Judgement in its favor. While the West Virginia EPA lawsuit is the alone basis that can guide the defendants a win here. However, the latest ruling came at the perfect time."

        "content": "The partnership would enable customers to receive money from over 200 countries.\n\nMFS Africa, a Ripple partner, has partnered with global American financial services giant Western Union.\n\nBenjamindada.com, a Nigerian-based online media platform dedicated to reporting on African tech startups, was the first to report this yesterday. The partnership will allow customers to send money from nearly anywhere globally to mobile wallets in Africa powered by MFS Africa\u2019s payment rails.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs disclosed in the report, the service is set to debut in Madagascar. However, no precise timeline is given for this. Hassan Chatila, Global Head of Account Payout Network, Western Union, commenting on the partnership, said:\n\n\u201cInnovation, commitment to customer focus and financial inclusion are at the heart of everything we do at Western Union. We are deeply committed to the region and remain focused on advancing cross-border money movement solutions for the people in this region, their communities as well as the broader economy. Through our collaboration with MFS Africa, we look forward to achieving our common critical role in getting money to the places where and when it is most needed.\u201c\n\nIt is worth noting that MFS Africa partnered with Ripple in November to leverage its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service to facilitate near-instant mobile payments for customers in 35 countries. Recall that this solution uses XRP as a bridge currency to facilitate cross-border payments.\n\nMFS Africa, touted as Africa\u2019s largest hub for mobile payments, claims to connect over 400 million mobile money wallets and 200 million bank accounts across Africa to facilitate cross-platform and cross-border payments for customers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe partnership between MFS Africa and Western Union is the latest in a growing list of collaborations between Ripple partners and traditional finance giants. Most recently, Airwallex announced a partnership with American Express to allow merchants to accept American Express card payments."

        "content": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is warning of negative consequences for the entire crypto industry if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) triumphs in the lawsuit against the payments firm.\n\nIn a new Bloomberg interview, Garlinghouse says that if the SEC prevails in the lawsuit in which it alleges XRP to be a security, that outcome will have implications for the whole crypto industry.\n\n\u201cThe SEC bringing the case against Ripple was not really just a case about Ripple or about XRP. It\u2019s really about the industry and how the SEC is kind of playing offense and attacking the whole industry. Two and a half years ago when it started, I\u2019m not sure everyone fully digested that. And now that is widely understood.\n\nThis is going to be pivotal for the whole industry because if the SEC is able to prevail, I think there\u2019s a lot of other cases and some of them just in the last four weeks: I think they brought five additional enforcement cases.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Ripple CEO, how the SEC is going about regulating the US crypto industry is \u201cnot healthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe macro headline for me is this is not a healthy way to regulate an industry. Regulation through enforcement as opposed to what we are seeing in other countries where they are doing the work \u2013 they are codifying, they are creating a framework that allows an industry to grow while protecting consumers.\u201d\n\nGarlinghouse says that the regulatory uncertainty in the US will and is negatively impacting the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\u201cLook at the benefits to the United States on a geopolitical basis to have the Amazons and Googles based and headquartered in the United States.\n\nWe are at, I think, severe risk of having that not happen in this next evolution of technology around blockchain and crypto. It has already started moving outside the United States.\n\nAnd also the consumers are suffering because of that. Because you don\u2019t have the same protections that the US regulatory frameworks can provide.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Despite the Supreme Court ruling that old N500 and N1,000 notes are still legal tender, fuel stations, supermarkets and market women are still rejecting the old Naira notes.\n\nRipples Nigeria reported on Friday that the Supreme Court ruled the old banknotes remain legal till December 31, 2023, thereby, setting aside the February 10 deadline to phase them out.\n\nThe Supreme Court said the Naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was an affront to the 1999 constitution of the country, hence, the old Naira notes remain legal for 10 months.\n\nHowever, the ruling of the Supreme Court was not enough to convince Nigerians of the legality of the old Naira notes, as traders, filling stations and some neighbourhood supermarkets are still accepting only new Naira banknotes.\n\nAn attendant at MRS Filling Station in Alagbole, Ifo LGA, area of Ogun State, said the old money can\u2019t be accepted yet because President Muhammadu Buhari hasn\u2019t spoken.\n\nDuring findings, our correspondent was told that the filling station was aware of the Supreme Court ruling, but the attendant said there\u2019s a need for a confirmation from President Buhari.\n\nAlso at a supermarket in the Magodo area of Lagos State, the store\u2019s management insisted on only receiving the redesigned naira notes, transfers or POS payments.\n\nRipples Nigeria learnt that customers can only buy their fuel with the redesigned Naira notes or transfer.\n\nSimilarly, attendants at a retail station of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited and Oando also rejected the old notes.\n\nRead also:Buhari mulls extension of old naira notes validity by 60 days\n\nAlso, traders at the popular Mile 12 market in Lagos State, refused to collect the old notes, for fear that banks may not collect it from them. They also provided the option of bank transfer for payment on goods sold.\n\nTheir rejection of the old Naira notes despite the Supreme Court judgement followed President Buhari and the CBN\u2019s history of giving opposing directives when the apex court rules.\n\nOn February 8, the Supreme Court ruled that the old currencies remain legal, however, the CBN said only the new Naira notes are legal.\n\nA week after on February 15, the Supreme Court again declared that the old banknotes were still legal tender, the next day, President Buhari said only the N200 notes will not be recirculated, excluding the N500 and N1,000 notes from continuous usage.\n\nAlthough, a legal practitioner at a law firm, Milestone Partners, Roland Aibangbee, had told Ripples Nigeria a week ago that, \u201crestraining the FG from implementing the February 10 deadline is that Nigerians can continue to use the old naira notes as a valid legal tender, as though the deadline by the Central Bank of Nigerian (CBN) was never set.\u201d\n\nAibangbee further stated, \u201cThe Supreme Court has given an order. If the CBN feels that the order is not binding on it and acts contrary to the order, Nigerians should still activate the legal means of punishing a person (natural or artificial) who disobeys an order of court.\u201d\n\nJoin the conversation\n\nOpinions\n\nSupport Ripples Nigeria, hold up solutions journalism\n\nBalanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.\n\nAs a media platform, we hold leadership accountable and will not trade the right to press freedom and free speech for a piece of cake.\n\nIf you like what we do, and are ready to uphold solutions journalism, kindly donate to the Ripples Nigeria cause.\n\nYour support would help to ensure that citizens and institutions continue to have free access to credible and reliable information for societal development.\n\nDonate Now"
