        "content": "XRP Lawsuit News: A delay in the long running U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Vs Ripple lawsuit summary judgment has kept the entire crypto industry waiting. A ruling over Ripple\u2019s native crypto, XRP token\u2019s nature is expected to clear a huge confusion over secondary sales.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Lawsuit Verdict Crucial For Major Cryptos Other than BTC\n\nadvertisement\n\nPro XRP Lawyer Expects Ruling By August\n\nAttorney Fred Rispoli, pro XRP lawyer predicted the possible end date of the US SEC vs Ripple lawsuit. The lawyer laid out the stats linked to the District Court, Analisa Torres\u2019s motions for summary judgment. He highlighted that the judge has granted the motion for summary judgment to defendants in 37% of the case. While the ruling has been given to plaintiffs in 24% of the lawsuits.\n\nAs per Rispoli, Motion for the summary judgment has been announced in an average time of 249 days. However, 60% of the rulings came between a period of 146 to 330 days.\n\nThis suggests that a verdict would have come around May 21, 2023, which is 249 days from September 17, 2022 (the date of filing the initial motion for summary judgment). He added that if one considers 330 days criteria then the ruling would come around August 10, 2023.

The docs suggested that then SEC director, Himan tried to make new regulations related to the industry which is a direct offense to the Congress.\n\nXRP holders\u2019 lawyer, John Deaton suggested that the ruling is getting more crucial day by day amid the US SEC\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry. It is expected that a good verdict for XRP, not Ripple would help the other tokens to fight the legal battle against the commission."

        "content": "Ripple (XRP) bulls are struggling to regain momentum after media reports on June 30 claimed Citigroup might be reconsidering its partnership with Metaco \u2014 a company Ripple Labs recently acquired for $250 million.\n\nBulls lose momentum\n\nRipple\u2019s native token XRP had been on a steady pump for almost two months. It hit a high of $0.54 because of multiple positive developments and industry expectations that its case with the SEC would end favorably.\n\nHowever, the momentum began sputtering out by mid-June, and the token fell as low as $0.31 on June 14 following the SEC\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry in the U.S. via lawsuits against Binance.US and Coinbase.\n\nBulls managed to regain some of the momentum last week and were on track to reclaim the previous high of $0.54 before the Citigroup news led to a sharp sell-off \u2014 causing the price to crash to $0.42, based on CryptoSlate data.\n\nSince then, the token has somewhat recovered to $0.47, as of press time, but is struggling to push further as bears are now firmly in control.\n\nCitigroup will likely drop Metaco\n\nBloomberg News reported June 30 that Citigroup has launched a review of its partnership with crypto custodian Metaco and could potentially replace the firm as its provider.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter told the newswire that the Wall Street giant had already begun the hunt for a new provider. According to the report, it is unclear whether the review is linked to Ripple.\n\nCitigroup entered a partnership with Switzerland-based Metaco in June 2022 and said the latter would help it \u201cdevelop and pilot\u201d digital asset custody capabilities.\n\nThe lender said at the time that it intended to integrate Metaco\u2019s Harmonize platform within its own services to offer its customers digital asset custody and settlement services.\n\nThe partnership also aimed to develop tokenization and custody solutions for traditional assets like securities.\n\nMetaco also counts major European banks among its partners, including Societe Generale and BNP Paribas. The latter confirmed that its partnership with Metaco remains \u201coperational.\u201d\n\nMetaco, Ripple and Citigroup did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.\n\nMentioned in this article"
