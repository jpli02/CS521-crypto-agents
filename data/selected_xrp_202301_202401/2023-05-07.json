        "content": "Open this photo in gallery: UBC\u2019s Sauder school of business associate professor Sima Sajjadiani co-authored the study that found employee exits change the operational and social fabric of workplaces, prompting more departures.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press\n\nEmployers vastly underestimate the impact of workers leaving an organization on staff left behind with a different workplace dynamic, leading to even more turnover, a new report says.\n\nUniversity of British Columbia\u2019s Sauder school of business Associate Professor Sima Sajjadiani co-authored the study that found employee exits, through termination, layoffs or by voluntary quitting, change the operational and social fabric of workplaces, prompting more departures.\n\n\u201cThe research sends a clear message to organizations that they should be extremely careful when they make exit decisions, or they risk destabilizing the whole organization very quickly,\u201d she said.\n\nProf. Sajjadiani, alongside two researchers from the University of Minnesota, analyzed data of about a million employees at 1,620 stores of a U.S.-based retail chain over a 22-month period.\n\nThey found that layoff announcements had a strong and immediate impact, increasing voluntary turnover among those who remained at the company.\n\nSuch events can enhance feelings of job insecurity among those who remain, leading to more employees quitting, the study says.\n\nHowever, the researchers found voluntary departures resulted in fewer turnovers, and that it typically takes longer for the ripple effect of subsequent departures to happen.\n\n\u201cTo high performers, voluntary exits are a positive signal that there are better opportunities elsewhere, so while employees might not leave immediately, they do begin to look for other opportunities,\u201d Prof. Sajjadiani said.\n\n\u201cUsually, the subsequent voluntary turnovers after voluntary turnover takes like three months or so, but for layoffs, it\u2019s really within the first month that a layoff is announced that a lot of employees leave the organization,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nThe study also revealed that when workers are fired, their departures have a relatively small, fleeting effect, and can even reduce voluntary turnover afterward.\n\n\u201cUsually these are people who are disruptive or abusive, or aren\u2019t doing their fair share,\u201d Prof. Sajjadiani said. \u201cWhen they go, high performers tend to stay longer, and the risk of voluntary turnover actually goes down.\u201d\n\nBut the study notes that if high performers are dismissed without clear justification and communication as to why, \u201cemployers not only open themselves to legal headaches, it also sends the wrong message to other high performers [and] they also start heading for the door.\u201d\n\nProf. Sajjadiani said the study is the first of its kind and should signal to employers that they need to consider possible increased turnover rates when telling other workers about an employee exit.\n\n\u201cNot all turnover events are the same. It really depends on how disruptive, critical and novel the experience of these events are for the workers in the organization and, depending on these three factors, we are going to see various effects of these events over time.\u201d\n\nWhile the study\u2019s data predates the COVID-19 pandemic, Prof. Sajjadiani said she believes the research remains relevant.\n\n\u201cIt is very timely for organizations to pay attention to these results because the final message of our paper is that whenever you make exit decisions, especially when it\u2019s involuntary, when there\u2019s a layoff or you dismiss employees, those decisions don\u2019t end there.\u201d"
