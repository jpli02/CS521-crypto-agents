        "content": "Modi 3.0 Live Modi Oath Ceremony Live\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nThe \u2018Live, Work, and Play in Dubai\u2019 podcast series offers a captivating exploration of Dubai's unique infrastructure and its role in cultivating an ideal environment for emerging entrepreneurs. This series serves as a window into the dynamic world of business and innovation that Dubai has to offer, providing valuable insights and inspiration for those looking to thrive in this vibrant city.In a recent episode, Navin Gupta, the Managing Director for South Asia and MENA at Ripple, engaged in an insightful conversation with Kabeer Sharma, Editor-in-Chief of Indiatimes. The discussion revolved around Ripple's innovative solutions, the broader implications of blockchain and cryptocurrency, and the pivotal role that Dubai and the UAE play in fostering the growth of future technologies, all while highlighting Gupta's deep appreciation for the UAE and reflecting on the resilience of his business during the Covid-19 pandemic.At its core, Ripple is a blockchain-based digital payment network committed to facilitating payment settlement, asset exchange, and remittances. The core mission of Ripple is to create cryptocurrency solutions that erase economic boundaries, enabling financial institutions, governments, businesses, and individuals to seamlessly transfer, manage, and tokenize value, thus unlocking vast economic potential.Gupta shed light on Ripple's primary focus: remittances. In a world where cross-border money transfers can be exorbitantly expensive, Ripple aims to tackle this critical issue. \u201cWe are essentially there to make the payment system cheaper, faster, better. In fact, already the technology exists where we could dramatically reduce the cost of payment.\u201d He provided a practical example to illustrate the problem, highlighting how, often, a yoga teacher in India collecting $25 from a student in the West ends up paying $100 in transaction fees.Ripple's solution is to make payment systems more affordable, faster, and efficient. Gupta noted that by leveraging cryptocurrencies, the cost of remittances could virtually drop to zero, all while adhering to tax and regulatory requirements. Traditional banks typically dismiss such small-scale transactions, making disruptive innovations like Ripple a game-changer. Currently, it costs approximately 7% to transfer money cross-border when the amount is below $200, imposing a significant burden on individuals and businesses alike.The perception of blockchain and cryptocurrency often revolves around volatility and scams, fueling scepticism. Gupta argued that blockchain and crypto have not yet realised their full potential, as they are yet to have their demonstration effect. Drawing parallels to how AI gained prominence when it became accessible and user-friendly, with ChatGPT leading the demonstration effect. \u201cFor blockchain and crypto, that demonstration effect still needs to happen, the email moment or the WhatsApp moment of blockchain needs to happen\u2026most likely it will happen from use cases like payment.\u201d Gupta contended that this transformation will likely stem from use cases like payment solutions, ultimately fulfilling the promises of blockchain technology.With blockchain's market value exceeding $1.2 trillion, Gupta emphasised the pivotal role of forward-thinking regulators in enabling the growth of blockchain-based businesses. Regulators must empower entrepreneurs, facilitating the construction of global enterprises without undue hindrance. Gupta lauded the UAE and Dubai for their proactive approach, highlighting their commitment to supporting emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain. \u201cHere the government essentially moves forward and says, what's the next big thing that the UAE can be part of, where we can essentially get onto the first stage itself, and they have chosen both AI and blockchain. That's the reason you're seeing a lot of positive movement from the government,\u201d said Gupta. He further adds that VARA and the larger government are enabling all new technologies, as long as it does not cross legal boundaries.The government's embrace of these innovations has ignited optimism and positive developments in the region.Dubai stands out as a thriving business hub where commerce takes precedence in the government's priorities. Emphasising on Dubai\u2019s role as a true business city, Gupta said, \u201cthere is no other place where doing business is so front and center for the government, for the private sector and just for the DNA of the country.\u201d Drawing parallels with Silicon Valley, Gupta explained that Dubai possesses the essential ingredients for success: access to venture capital, a diverse pool of global talent, and a regulatory environment that fosters innovation. Policies like the golden visa have attracted top talent from around the world to Dubai, transforming it into a place where individuals can live, work, and enjoy a high quality of life. The collaborative atmosphere among like-minded individuals in Dubai catalyses innovation and growth.In conclusion, Gupta underscored the importance of governments recognising the permanence of cryptocurrencies and enacting supportive regulations. \u201cIt's for the government to recognise that crypto is here to stay. And should find enabling regulation,\u201d he says. Rather than pushing individuals into the grey area of unregulated activities, Gupta advocated for enabling regulations that empower individuals and businesses to make informed choices. By offering the right mechanisms and choices, governments can guide responsible and compliant participation in the crypto ecosystem, ensuring a bright and sustainable future for this emerging technology in Dubai and beyond.Disclaimer - This article is part of a featured content series on Business in Dubai.
