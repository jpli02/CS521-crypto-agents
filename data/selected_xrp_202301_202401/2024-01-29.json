        "content": "Attorney Deaton sheds light on a major legal precedent from the Second Circuit that could impact the outcome of the SEC\u2019s legal battles against Coinbase and Ripple.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s chief legal officer (CLO) Paul Grewal and pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton have identified an important case that could determine the outcome of the SEC\u2019s lawsuits against Ripple and Coinbase.\n\nRevak v. SEC Realty Second Circuit Decision\n\nIn a recent tweet, Grewal expressed his admiration for a Second Circuit decision in the 1994 case involving Revak and SEC Realty.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, the CLO identified a crucial factor in the decision, underscoring the recklessness in defining security through an ecosystem access lens.\n\nGrewal focused on a portion of the decision where the Second Circuit held that the correlation between a promoter\u2019s efforts and investors\u2019 fortune does not easily satisfy the Howey test.\n\nTo interpret the Howey test, the court ruled that a common enterprise can be established only when \u201cthe fortuity of the investments collectively is essentially dependent upon promoter expertise.\u201d\n\nDeaton Reacts\n\nGrewal\u2019s tweet stirred a reaction from Deaton, who drew parallels between the Revak case and the SEC\u2019s legal tussles with Ripple, Coinbase, and LBRY.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe pro-XRP lawyer pointed out the jurisdictional nuances in the lawsuits. While Deaton said the LBRY case is in the First Circuit, he mentioned that the Ripple and Coinbase lawsuits against the SEC are in the Second Circuit.\n\nAccording to Deaton, the cases involving Ripple and Coinbase are governed by the Second Circuit and the Revak decision. In response, Grewal agreed with Attorney Deaton\u2019s opinion on the matter.\n\nYes sir. Yes they are. \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) January 28, 2024\n\nImportance of Ripple and Coinbase Cases\n\nThe significance of the SEC cases against Coinbase and Ripple cannot be overemphasized, as both lawsuits are expected to impact the future of the crypto industry.\n\nThe Ripple lawsuit is in the final stage (remedies), where the court will determine the appropriate penalty the company will pay for violating the law through its institutional sales of XRP.\n\nPer the latest update in the lawsuit, the SEC wants the court to compel Ripple to produce some records relating to its post-complaint institutional XRP sales.\n\nOn the other hand, the Coinbase lawsuit is still in its early phase. The SEC and Coinbase are still awaiting the court\u2019s decision on the hearing of Coinbase\u2019s motion to dismiss the case.\n\nSome legal experts, including Attorney James Murphy (a.k.a. MetaLawMan), speculate that the court will issue the decision within three months."

        "title": "1st gravitational wave detector in space 'LISA' will hunt for ripples in spacetime - Space.com",
        "content": "Humanity's first space-based gravitational wave detector has received the go-ahead.\n\nThe Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, which consists of three spacecraft that together form a single gravitational wave detector, is a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). It's set to launch in the mid-2030s.\n\nThe adoption of LISA was announced by ESA on Jan. 25, and recognizes that the mission concept and associated technology are sufficiently advanced. Getting the green light means scientists can start building the spacecraft as well as its required instruments; work will begin in Jan. 2025 after a European industrial contractor has been selected for construction.\n\nThe three spacecraft of LISA will trail Earth as our planet orbits the sun, forming an equilateral triangle in space. Each side of this triangle which will be a staggering 1.6 million miles (2.6 kilometers) long. The LISA craft will fire laser beams down these sides, which will experience minute-long alterations as gravitational waves pass over them, squashing and squeezing the very fabric of space.\n\n\"LISA is an endeavor that has never been tried before,\" LISA lead project scientist Nora L\u00fctzgendorf said in a statement. \"Using laser beams over distances of several kilometers, ground-based instrumentation can detect gravitational waves coming from events involving star-sized objects \u2014 such as supernova explosions or the merging of hyper-dense stars and stellar-mass black holes. To expand the frontier of gravitational studies, we must go to space.\"\n\nRelated: The universe is humming with gravitational waves. Here's why scientists are so excited about the discovery\n\nGravitational waves were first predicted by Albert Einstein, arising from his 1915 theory of gravity: General relativity.\n\n\n\nThis revolutionary theory suggested that gravity arises as the result of objects with mass curving the very fabric of space and time, which are actually united as a single entity called spacetime. The greater the mass of an object, the larger the curvature that object causes \u2014 and thus the greater its gravitational influence. General relativity therefore explains, for instance, why stars have a stronger gravity than planets, but black holes have a stronger gravity than stars.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

These gravitational waves are insignificant unless the accelerating objects are massive compact objects (like black holes or neutron stars) orbiting around one other and eventually colliding. Collapsing massive stars can, which also trigger supernova explosions, can send out some substantial waves.\n\nYet, even in the most extreme cases, Einstein believed that gravitational waves would still be too faint to detect from Earth. He was wrong about that.\n\n\n\nFortunately, in Sept. 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in the U.S. and the Virgo interferometer in Italy indeed detected ripples in spacetime. These waves were formed from the collision and merger of two black holes 29 and 36 times the mass of the sun, located over 1 billion light-years away.\n\nAnd. since then, gravitational wave astronomers have detected signals from a multitude of events, including more black hole mergers, neutron star collisions and even mixed mergers between a black hole and a neutron star.\n\n(Image credit: ESA)\n\nLISA is ready to take this achievement even further as a space-based interferometer with the sensitivity to \"hear\" gravitational waves from merging black holes, neutron stars and supernovas at much greater distances than is possible for Earth-based detectors. This also means it'll be able to search for waves sourced from events further back in time.\n\n\"Thanks to the huge distance traveled by the laser signals on LISA and the superb stability of its instrumentation, we will probe gravitational waves of lower frequencies than is possible on Earth, uncovering events of a different scale, all the way back to the dawn of time,\" L\u00fctzgendorf said.\n\n(Image credit: ESA)\n\nAs well as detecting gravitational waves from more distant sources, LISA should also provide astronomers with the sensitivity to investigate closer and less extreme events such as the merger of compact white stars, which are born when smaller stars like the sun die.\n\n\"For centuries, we have been studying our cosmos through capturing light. Coupling this with the detection of gravitational waves is bringing a totally new dimension to our perception of the Universe,\" LISA project scientist Oliver Jennrich said in the statement. \"If we imagine that, so far, with our astrophysics missions, we have been watching the cosmos like a silent movie, capturing the ripples of spacetime with LISA will be a real game-changer, like when sound was added to motion pictures.\""

        "title": "Biden's gas export pause could ripple through LNG lawsuits - E&E News by POLITICO",
        "content": "The Biden administration\u2019s decision to halt new liquefied natural gas exports may bolster pending lawsuits against the government\u2019s approvals of proposed LNG facilities \u2014 and could face its own hurdles in court.\n\nThe Department of Energy announced Friday that it will stop approving new LNG exports to nations without free-trade agreements. The agency will review its process for deciding whether overseas shipments of super-chilled natural gas are in the public interest, given growing concerns about LNG\u2019s effect on climate change.\n\nThe temporary pause, which is expected to last months, was a decisive win for environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers who have been ramping up pressure on the White House to address emissions from the nation\u2019s rapidly increasing LNG exports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt may also boost environmentalists\u2019 legal fight over an LNG export terminal in Alaska that raises the very issue DOE plans to investigate: How should climate risks be accounted for when the government decides a gas export project is in the public interest?\n\nDOE is due to file briefs Feb. 14 in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a lawsuit opposing a $39 billion LNG export terminal backed by Alaska Gasline Development. The project \u2014 which DOE previously determined is in the public interest \u2014 is designed to export fuel primarily to Asian markets.\n\n\u201cHopefully the thinking that has prevailed today, in terms of the need for this pause, will also be evident in whatever they file in this case,\u201d said Moneen Nasmith, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, which is representing environmental groups opposing Alaska LNG.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit is separately weighing whether to approve additional exports to non-free-trade-agreement countries from Golden Pass LNG in Texas. The D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments last October and has not yet ruled on the case.\n\nCourts can also be influenced by changing policies related to the cases before them, said Keith Hall, director of the Energy Law Center at Louisiana State University.\n\nSome judges \u201cmight be tempted to pause litigation\u201d for existing LNG approvals, he said. \u201cA judge could reason that, depending on what the administration does, the case might become moot, so why not wait and see.\u201d\n\nA number of pending projects not yet tied up in litigation will be affected by the policy freeze, including Commonwealth LNG in and Venture Global\u2019s project CP2, both in Louisiana\u2019s Cameron Parish.\n\nFor projects with export approvals and lawsuits that pre-date the Biden administration\u2019s pause, courts\u2019 consideration of DOE\u2019s review in those cases may be limited, said Max Sarinsky, a senior attorney at the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University.\n\n\u201cTechnically speaking, this announcement is outside the records of those approvals,\u201d he said. \u201cBut contextually, it\u2019s in the atmosphere. It might give judges a little bit more pause.\u201d\n\nWhile the Biden administration has said the pause would only apply to LNG projects that have not yet been approved, DOE has acknowledged that its existing analysis does not account for the recent surge in gas exports, said James Coleman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University. LNG project opponents could use that acknowledgement to bolster their claims against DOE in pending lawsuits warning of the industry\u2019s climate impact, he said.\n\n\u201cI would be shocked if those groups didn\u2019t rely on it,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if the Biden administration does not withdraw its support for prior approvals, Coleman said LNG project developers could still face a problem in court if DOE is no longer defending its past analyses \u201cas enthusiastically as possible.\u201d\n\nLegal claims\n\nLegal experts also said they would not be surprised to see lawsuits against the pause itself.\n\nLSU\u2019s Hall said the DOE review may conflict with its responsibilities under the Natural Gas Act, which requires the agency to grant export authority to non-free-trade-agreement nations unless the proposal is found to be inconsistent with the public interest.\n\n\u201cThe Natural Gas Act creates an explicit presumption that such exports are in the public interest,\u201d Hall said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe administration\u2019s pause seems to ignore this statutory presumption.\u201d\n\nLNG project developers could also bring arbitration claims seeking compensation from DOE if they believe the agency is discriminating against their project, Coleman said.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s just a very challenging thing to get a project built if the federal government doesn\u2019t want to build it,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, no groups have signaled that they plan to challenge the Biden administration\u2019s LNG pause.\n\nThe Biden administration has put oil and gas activity on hold before. In 2021, the Interior Department froze new oil and gas lease sales to study the program\u2019s climate impacts. The move quickly faced legal action from Republican-led states, and \u2014 under pressure from the courts and Congress \u2014 the government later resumed lease sales.\n\nBut while the Mineral Leasing Act requires Interior to hold quarterly lease sales on public lands, there is no such timetable in the Natural Gas Act for DOE\u2019s evaluation of LNG exports, said Earthjustice\u2019s Nasmith.\n\nWith its LNG pause, she said, DOE is saying, \u201cWe have a reasonable basis to take longer because we realize what we\u2019ve been doing to date is pretty flawed and out-of-date and needs to be updated.\u201d\n\nDOE has not said it\u2019s not going to make a decision on exports, said Nasmith. The agency is just saying it needs more time.\n\n\u201cThere does not seem to be a particularly valid legal basis for any kind of challenge to the pause itself,\u201d she added.\n\nThe last time DOE updated its criteria for determining whether LNG projects are in the public interest was in 2018, before the United States became a global leader in gas exports. Now the agency has data available to test claims on how LNG exports are affecting the domestic gas market, climate change and the coal industry, said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen\u2019s energy program.\n\nPausing approvals while the agency reviews its existing standards \u201cis exactly the way regulation should work,\u201d he said."
