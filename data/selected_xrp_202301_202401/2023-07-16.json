        "title": "Former SEC attorney on Ripple's crypto-celebration: It's temporary - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Former United States Securities Exchanges Commission (SEC) attorney John Reed Stark has expressed concerns over the recent Ripple decision, cautioning against premature celebration within the crypto community. In the long-standing case, the blockchain firm earned partial victory after the court declared XRP was not a security.\n\nWhile the decision has been widely regarded as a loss for the SEC, Reed believes it rests on shaky ground and is likely to be appealed and potentially reversed, he said in a post on July 14.\n\n\u201cBut IMHO, the decision resides on shaky ground, is likely (and ripe) for appeal, will likely result in reversal and is not necessarily a cause for celebration. (Please don\u2019t kill the messenger.),\u201d Reed said.\n\nThe former SEC official expects the court to overturn the district court\u2019s rulings on programmatic and other sales. Without such a reversal, he foresees the emergence of a new type of token, programmatic buyer tokens (PBTs).\n\n\u201cOtherwise, get ready for a new crypto-iteration \u2013 PBTs \u2013 programmatic buyer tokens, available on your friendly neighborhood (and unregistered and unregulated) crypto-trading platform,\u201d he said.\n\nTroubling issues\n\nReed argued that the decision raises troubling issues on multiple fronts and appears to contradict the SEC\u2019s mission and authority. He highlighted two major points of contention with the Ripple decision. Firstly, he criticized the discrepancy in SEC protection between institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe attorney noted that while institutional investors are granted full SEC protection and remedies for violations, retail investors are left without similar safeguards. This inequitable treatment raises concerns about the decision\u2019s alignment with the SEC\u2019s mission to protect all investors.\n\nHe also questioned the notion put forth in the Ripple decision that if a crypto-issuer sells their tokens through an exchange, securities regulations do not apply because exchange customers are presumed to be unaware of the issuer.\n\nReed argues that investor ignorance or a lack of research has never been a valid defense for securities violations. Reed suggests that retail investors, although they may not have known they were supplying capital to Ripple, likely had access to the same information as institutional investors regarding Ripple\u2019s intentions.\n\n\u201cMoreover, I don\u2019t to buy into the idea that retail investors are so ignorant. The purchasers may not have known that they were supplying capital to Ripple, but they presumably knew the same information that the institutional investors knew about Ripple\u2019s intentions,\u201d he said.\n\nCrypto purchasers\u2019 knowledge of a security\n\nHe also raised questions about the Ripple Court\u2019s presumption that purchasers may not know who the issuer is or who is selling the token. He stated that it should be presumed that purchasers know these details.\n\nFurthermore, the absence of a contract between the buyer and seller of a stock on an exchange does not negate the identification of the stock as a security. The key issue, according to Reed, should be whether investors can expect profits from the efforts of a third party, regardless of the counterparty\u2019s identity.\n\nReed pointed out that token buyers often engage in speculative investment based on the expectation that someone else will be willing to pay more for the token\u2014a concept known as \u201cThe Greater Fool Theory.\u201d Even if a retail investor buys a token solely based on this theory and is unaware of the precise counterparty, the investment should still be considered a security, argues Reed.\n\nFinally, Reed questioned the notion that tokens sold to institutional investors as securities can suddenly transform into \u201cnot securities\u201d when those same tokens are sold on platforms like Coinbase or Binance. He finds this transformation inconsistent and raises concerns about the implications for the crypto industry.\n\nWhile Reed is projecting the SEC to appeal the case, the Ripple team has a contrary opinion. According to CEO Brad Garlinghouse, appealing the case by the regulator might take some time.\n\nNotably Reed has for long backed the SEC in its crypto enforcement at some point warning that investors should get out of the sector. As reported by Finbold, Reed stated that the latest action by the SEC is an indication that regulatory purge has just begun. At some point he called on crypto enthusiasts to face the law and avoid personal attacks on the enforcement body."

        "title": "Why it matters whether crypto coins like Ripple's are considered securities - The Business Times",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency traders have been put on notice that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers a range of widely-traded digital assets to be securities, a position that could impose regulatory requirements that many boosters say could be crippling.\n\nBut figuring out what does or doesn\u2019t make a coin a security is a complicated question. For example, a federal judge ruled in July that one particular token, XRP, was a security when it was sold directly to institutional investors, but was not when sold to the general public on exchanges.\n\n1. What is the SEC doing?\n\nChair Gary Gensler, who long argued that many digital assets have the hallmarks of securities, continues to take an increasingly hard line. On Jun 6, the agency sued Coinbase Global, the biggest US crypto trading platform, alleging that it illegally listed numerous tokens.\n\nIn a separate case announced the day before, the SEC alleged that Binance Holdings also listed unregistered securities. In those two lawsuits, the SEC designated 19 digital tokens trading on the platforms as securities \u2013 a move that was perceived by investors as so potentially damaging that it caused a sharp sell-off. The coins\u2019 combined market value slumped by about US$23 billion in the week after the first lawsuit was filed.\n\n2. What does it mean for something be a security?\n\nIn its most simple form, whether something is or is not a security under US rules is basically a question of how much it looks like shares of stock issued by a company seeking to raise money. To make that determination, the SEC applies a legal test that comes from a 1946 US Supreme Court decision.\n\nUnder that framework, known as the Howey test, an asset can be considered a security \u2013 and thus under SEC purview \u2013 when it involves investors kicking in money with the intention of profiting from the efforts of the organisation\u2019s leadership.\n\nSEE ALSO The IPO dilemma for Vietnam\u2019s four tech unicorns\n\nGET BT IN YOUR INBOX DAILY Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up VIEW ALL\n\n3. Why does calling a token a security matter?\n\nAmong other things, it makes running a crypto exchange more expensive and complex. Under US rules, the label carries strict investor-protection requirements for platforms and issuers. That means exchanges would face continuous scrutiny by regulators, which could lead to fines, penalties and, in the worst case, potential prosecutions.\n\nSupporters of more regulation believe securities designations would result in more information and transparency for investors because of the SEC disclosure requirements that would apply.\n\n4. Who\u2019s against that approach?\n\nCrypto enthusiasts say that their ventures are decentralised in a way that makes old rules a poor fit. Crypto trading platforms argue that the assets they\u2019re listing should be considered commodities, not securities. In the US, rules governing trading of commodities and their derivatives are focused more on ensuring that companies, producers and farmers can effectively hedge against risks of price swings in commodities.\n\n5. What do the courts say?\n\nThere was one decision in July that many in the crypto industry took as a win. In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs for allegedly raising money by selling the XRP digital token without registering it as a security.\n\nThe SEC claimed that the company was funding its growth by issuing XRP to investors betting that its value would rise. On Jul 13, US District Judge Analisa Torres in New York ruled that Ripple\u2019s sales to sophisticated investors met the test for an investment contract because those buyers \u201cwould have understood that Ripple was pitching a speculative value proposition for XRP with potential profits\u201d.\n\nBut the judge said that did not apply to the broader public buying crypto on exchanges. Many industry figures and experts took the latter part of the ruling as a possible blow to the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction. Still, the decision is just one district court opinion and is not binding in other parts of the country.\n\n6. What does the crypto community want?\n\nThere have been efforts in the US Congress to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the derivatives watchdog, more power to regulate crypto assets directly. Currently, it primarily oversees crypto futures and has the ability to take enforcement action if there is fraud or manipulation in the underlying market.\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s regulatory regime is considered less onerous than the SEC\u2019s, so it\u2019s little surprise that the crypto crowd wants to be overseen by the CFTC. In 2022, crypto executives and titans of traditional markets like Citadel Securities joined an industry push behind a bill that would give the CFTC more turf. That effort stalled after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which was one of the most vocal companies pushing for the change.\n\nIn June this year, two House Republicans released a new proposal that would give the CFTC authority to oversee certain tokens and create a pathway for coins that begin as securities to eventually be regulated as commodities.\n\n7. What is the CFTC\u2019s view?\n\nChairman Rostin Behnam has pushed back on the notion that the agency is a \u201clight-touch regulator\u201d. At a House Agriculture Committee hearing on Jun 6, he said the CFTC had brought more than 85 cases that resulted in more than US$4 billion in penalties and restitution.\n\nHe said CFTC rules \u201care quite extensive, are more prescriptive, and are very specific to protecting customers and protecting markets\u201d. The CFTC was the first of the market regulators to bring an enforcement action against Binance.\n\n8. What coins are and aren\u2019t considered a security?\n\nBeyond Bitcoin \u2013 the biggest cryptocurrency \u2013 there is a lot of ambiguity. US regulators including the SEC agree that Bitcoin is not a security. It was started by an unknown person or persons going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and does not exist as a way to raise money for a specific project.\n\nThe second-biggest token, Ether, was deemed not to be a security during President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. A senior SEC official signalled that while it may have started out as a security \u2013 the Ethereum Foundation used it to raise money \u2013 it had grown into something sufficiently decentralised that it probably no longer was one.\n\nBut after Ethereum changed to a system in which coins that are \u201cstaked\u201d play a role in recording transactions, Gensler said that the fact that staked coins can earn the equivalent of interest might lead regulators to start treating it as a security. The CFTC, however, deems Ether a commodity.\n\n9. Is this an issue elsewhere?\n\nYes. Globally, different regulators have taken a range of positions on whether to treat cryptocurrencies as securities. The UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Agency regulates digital assets it considers investments that come with rights to repayment or a share in profits, while \u201cpayment tokens\u201d like Bitcoin or \u201cutility tokens\u201d that provide access to a service are unregulated.\n\nSingapore regulates both types but under different laws. It considers coins that are digital representations of other assets, such as unlisted shares, to be securities. The European Council in May adopted a legal framework for imposing common cryptocurrency rules across all 27 member states.\n\nIn June, Hong Kong kicked off a new licensing system to regulate crypto exchanges offering trading in tokens like Bitcoin and Ether. The UK is also formulating its own crypto regulations and marketing itself as a welcoming destination for digital-asset firms, despite pushback from reluctant banks. BLOOMBERG"
