        "title": "Bullish for Ripple (XRP)? New ETP to Debut in Europe in December - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Investors stateside in both the cryptocurrency and traditional finance worlds are eagerly awaiting a Bitcoin ETF product in the U.S.\n\nBut those in Europe looking for an XRP exchange-traded product will have one next month.\n\nEurope Gets an XRP ETP in December\n\nDeFi Technologies, Inc. announced last week it will debut a new Ripple XRP ETP on a European exchange. The Canada-based Web 3.0 company will be ready to launch the product in early December.\n\nIt will offer the product through its subsidiary, Valour Inc. The blockchain company says the Ripple ETP will cater to the \u201cgrowing demand among European investors for diverse cryptocurrency exposure.\u201d\n\nA recent report says Valour currently offers a number of innovative blockchain products. That includes Ethereum Zero and Bitcoin Zero, two fully hedged Ether and Bitcoin ETPs, with zero management fees.\n\n\u201cThe addition of the XRP ETP is part of Valour\u2019s broader strategy to provide investors with access to a range of digital assets in a regulated format,\u201d the report added.\n\nXRP Price Hangs in Balance of SEC Lawsuit\n\nRipple price is on the rebound after tumbling from $0.72 to $0.58 the second week in November. The cross-border blockchain network designed for institutional finance saw its XRP tokens rise by 12% in the past 30 days and 36% over the past six months.\n\nThe XRP investor community has been waiting on the edge of their seats for months for a resolution of a years-long SEC lawsuit. One XRP analyst recently predicted the Ripple token could achieve a market price of $0.71 to finish the year."

        "title": "Two Possible Scenarios for XRP Going Into Next Week (Ripple Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "XRP Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAfter failing to breach the $0.74 mark, Ripple initiated a corrective leg, retracing toward the 100-day and 200-day moving averages at approximately $0.55.\n\nHowever, a crucial support region stands in the way, potentially putting a halt to Ripple\u2019s short-term downward trajectory.\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nThe daily chart illustrates that Ripple encountered seller dominance when attempting to surpass the $0.74 mark, impeding further upward momentum. Subsequently, the price entered a correction stage, retracing toward a pivotal support region on the daily chart.\n\nThis critical support range encompasses the 100 and 200-day moving averages, along with the static support level of $0.54, providing substantial psychological support for Ripple.\n\nGiven recent price action and the significance of the $0.54 support range, there is a high likelihood of an extension of the consolidation stage, with the price experiencing volatility around this crucial mark. If Ripple buyers re-enter the market, a fresh uptrend could potentially be initiated with the aim of reclaiming the $0.74 resistance threshold.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nTurning attention to the 4-hour chart, Ripple\u2019s upward movement encountered a formidable barrier within a critical resistance region defined by the price range between the 0.5 and 0.618 levels of the Fibonacci retracement ($0.6799-$0.7408). Intensified selling pressure in this crucial region led to a notable decline, marked by an extended retracement.\n\nIn the event that this retracement continues, Ripple\u2019s multi-month ascending trendline, denoted by orange lines, and the static support region of $0.48 are poised to serve as the price\u2019s main support. However, a successful breach of the 0.618 level of the Fibonacci retracement would invalidate this scenario, potentially triggering a substantial upward movement for Ripple\u2019s price."

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nMarisa Coppel, Senior Counsel at the Blockchain Association, opened up about the challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry, particularly in dealing with the SEC\u2019s regulatory approach. She expressed concerns about the SEC\u2019s potential attempts to slow down the industry\u2019s progress, attributing it to a combination of factors. In an interview with Thinking Crypto, she touched on the Biden Administration\u2019s seemingly negative stance on crypto and the uncertainty surrounding regulatory developments.\n\nCoppel highlighted her recent testimony in front of the IRS, saying that the questions raised during the session indicated a critical examination of crypto-related issues. She suggested that regulators might not have fully grasped the implications of their proposals, especially concerning non-custodial wallet software developers and DeFi projects. Coppel pointed out the potential adverse impact on innovation if regulations are enacted without consideration.\n\nThe conversation delved into the SEC\u2019s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which provides the SEC\u2019s perspective on crypto-related accounting practices. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently reviewed SAB 121, concluding that it qualifies as a rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Coppel discussed the implications of this opinion, noting its potential influence on future legal challenges.\n\nShe also spoke about the Grayscale appeal and the judges\u2019 criticism of the SEC, describing their actions as arbitrary and capricious. Coppel expressed optimism about the shifting dynamics, with the SEC facing increasing scrutiny and legal setbacks. The discussion touched on the ongoing Ripple case and its potential implications for the broader industry.\n\nTalking about Ripple and SEC settlement, she said, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s really hard to tell. I don\u2019t know. It would be surprising if they could agree on a settlement. I think the SEC would have to really fall on their sword, you know, for that.\u201d\n\nRegarding the SEC\u2019s legal battle with Coinbase, Coppel mentioned that the Blockchain Association filed an amicus brief supporting Coinbase in an enforcement action. The case is scheduled for oral argument in January, and Coppel expressed hope that the judge would consider the lack of regulatory clarity in the industry. The conversation concluded with insights into the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance, with Coppel noting that similar arguments to the Coinbase case might apply, although the specific facts differ."

        "title": "Industry Expert Makes Strong Case For XRP Rocketing Past $9,000 Amid Global Banking System Overhaul - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe Head of Social Adoption at XRP Healthcare, Edward Farina, has made a bullish case for XRP rocketing to the $10,000 level if Ripple\u2019s enterprise-facing network, RippleNet, replaces SWIFT in the global banking system.\n\nHow XRP Could Reach $10,000\n\nEdward Farina has recently proposed a scenario where XRP could soar to $10,000 as RippleNet takes over the legacy SWIFT system of cross-border payments.\n\nIn a post on the X platform, Farina wrote about the tenets of market dynamics, arguing against popular misconceptions concerning XRP\u2019s potential growth trajectory. \u201cFew people seem to understand the principle of supply and demand. I always see people being shocked when they see someone saying that $XRP can reach 10k. (Not saying it necessarily will.),\u201d he posited.\n\nThe pundit observed how global financial institutions like SWIFT move hundreds of trillions of dollars worldwide. This makes Farina think that XRP can skyrocket to unprecedented levels if it can just capture a small fraction of the sector.\n\nRipple was designed to topple the traditional SWIFT system of cross-border payments. Offering a swifter process using RippleNet, unaffected by the weekend or holiday delays and free of the absurd transaction costs associated with SWIFT transfers, Ripple aims to create a crypto-based solution closely mirroring the traditional financial ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company\u2019s cross-border payment network RippleNET, uses XRP as a bridge currency to facilitate the transfer of value between different international currencies for its clients. Since its inception, RippleNet has openly touted itself as a competitor to SWIFT.\n\nFarina further highlighted XRP\u2019s technological superiority over other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), specifically in terms of transaction speed and finality. \u201cXRP settles value in real-time (an average of 3 seconds) and with finality. BTC cannot do that, neither ETH nor SWIFT. Period,\u201d the XRP Healthcare executive opined.\n\nXRP\u2019s Potential Takeover Of SWIFT\n\nGrayscale has also recently affirmed XRP\u2019s potential to overtake the global interbank messaging network SWIFT. The asset manager wrote in its latest \u201cCurrencies Crypto Sector\u201d report that \u201cBeyond Bitcoin, XRP is the second largest asset. Designed as an alternative to SWIFT, XRP aims to offer fast cross-border payments at lower transaction costs than competitors.\u201d\n\nRipple has long maintained it intends to break SWIFT\u2019s monopoly on cross-border transactions between banks. Nonetheless, taking down a global financial juggernaut has not proved easy.\n\nRipple has been stuck in a lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for nearly three years over whether XRP qualifies as a security. While a federal judge in July ruled that Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP on exchanges were not securities offerings, the case resolution could be a potential boon for RippleNet."
