        "content": "But, for many people outside of the XRP Army, Ripple has been something like a canker on the blockchain industry. This perhaps started with Ripple Labs\u2019 token distribution plan, the very thing being questioned by the SEC. Similar to some token treasuries today, Ripple decided it would control the disbursement of the 100 billion XRP units that will ever exist, distributing them to the community, early investors and the company\u2019s founders. This is partially why Jed McCaleb, the founder of Ripple who left to found the competing payments-focused blockchain Stellar, has had so many tokens available to dump on the market over the years."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple almost two and half years ago, alleging the XRP token is a security. As the court case approaches the summary judgment stage, a raft of evidence was made available today by both sides. One of them was internal SEC email discussions about the Hinman speech in 2018 in which the SEC\u2019s Bill Hinman stated that Ethereum was not a security. This was meant to be a smoking gun, but it\u2019s not clear that it is. Other disclosures may work against Ripple.\n\nThe Hinman emails demonstrate many caveats by the SEC\u2019s lawyers. An earlier draft was less definitive about Ethereum not being a security, and they suggested Hinman should make the position clearer.\n\nAnother piece of evidence is an SEC memo about an August 2018 meeting between Ripple\u2019s CEO Brad Garlinghouse, its CTO David Schwartz and then SEC Chair Jay Clayton and Hinman. Garlinghouse states that Ripple is in \u201cpurgatory\u201d around the uncertainty over whether XRP is a security. Clayton shut him down, saying it was not the proper forum for a discussion on the topic. And it was Clayton that initiated the SEC lawsuit just before his departure from office.\n\nThere\u2019s a memo that redacted who wrote it and to whom it was addressed, which appears to be a Ripple lawyer providing advice. It gives an opinion that XRP is not a security, but its justification is optimistic on multiple counts.\n\nHundreds of disclosures were released today, and we didn\u2019t have time to go through them all. However, we know that one set is from Ripple about its communications with crypto exchanges to get XRP listed. That\u2019s unlikely to be in Ripple\u2019s favor.\n\nMeanwhile, Garlinghouse previously compared the SEC\u2019s stance on crypto to a \u201cdrunk in denial\u201d."
