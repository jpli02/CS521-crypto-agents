        "title": "The Ultimate Guide To Pea Milk - Mashed",
        "content": "The Ultimate Guide To Pea Milk\n\nPea milk may not initially sound as appetizing as almond or oat milk, but it's looking like the next big thing in the world of plant-based dairy alternatives. Boasting an enviable amount of nutrients, creamy texture, and low calorie count, it's poised to become the darling of the plant-based milk aisle \u2014 if enough people can get over the idea of drinking a vegetable. Judging by the enduring popularity of soy milk, they definitely can.\n\nSince 2015, pea milk has seen a rapid rise in sales, with a 27% increase in 2022 alone. Investors can expect it to rise from $105 million in sales in 2022 to $283 million by 2032.\n\nConsidering these numbers, it's worth taking a closer look at this latest plant-based milk phenomenon to figure out whether it's worth all the hype. Brands are touting its unrivaled nutritional profile, dairy-mimicking flavor, and negligible environmental impact. But, as with all marketing, all those claims need a fact check. Whether you're a pea milk devotee or a complete novice, it's time to dive into the specifics of what this new vegan milk is all about."

        "content": "Pay in the crypto space is undoubtedly in a worse place than it was a few years ago. There have been some signs of recovery however and at $15bn fintech Ripple, pay might be better than ever.\n\nData from the H1B Visa salary database shows that four of the six largest salaries ever issued by Ripple through the scheme have occurred in 2023. The earliest recorded salary for Ripple was in 2014.\n\nThe number one spot is a $267k salary offered to a senior software engineering manager in San Francisco who joined at the start of March. It's not clear who received that sum but there are various candidates. Kunal Ahluwalia joined Ripple in February. His previous roles include an engineering manager at Tableau and senior engineer at Tesla. The salaries don't necessarily apply to new hires, however; former Nomura and Blackrock engineer Nisha DSouza joined Ripple in the same role in March 2022.\n\nOnly one person on an H1B Visa at Ripple is being paid a salary higher than $200k outside of California: a lead product manager in New York who joined in January earning $240k. In New York, there are two lead product managers that both joined from BlockFi around that time: Inna Raykhman and Aman Khurana.\n\nRipple appears to be hiring lightly in 2023. While it had 20 salaries listed for the first half of 2022, that number has fallen to just 7 in 2023.\n\nClick here to create a profile on eFinancialCareers.

        "content": "Schwartz says it is a crime to impersonate a federal judge.\n\nRipple CTO David Schwartz has reacted to a recent tweet by XRPP (XRP Productions), a satirical Twitter account focused on sharing humor about the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nIt all started yesterday after XRPP took to Twitter to claim that Judge Analisa Torres is ready to issue a summary judgment decision in the SEC vs. Ripple case.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe person behind the satirical account attached a screenshot showing conversations with the Judge presiding over the lawsuit. In the discussion, the parody account, posing as Judge Torres, started the chat with XRPP and indicated that she was ready to release the ruling.\n\n\u201cXRPP, I\u2019m ready to release the ruling,\u201d the parody account posing as Judge Torres said.\n\nRipple CTO Reacts\n\nAlthough XRP community members knew the chat was one of XRP Production\u2019s pranks, Ripple\u2019s CTO warned him about the consequences of such actions. Schwartz took to the comment section and warned XRPP that it is a crime to impersonate a United States federal judge.\n\n(Badly) impersonating a Federal judge is (probably) a crime. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) May 25, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nResponding to the comment, XRPP asked Ripple CTO whether it is legal to \u201cexpertly impersonate a federal judge.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan joined the conversation and also asked whether being funny and witty is a crime.\n\nIs funny and witty even a crime? \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 25, 2023\n\nSchwartz did not issue a response to comments from XRPP and attorney Morgan. Unlike other Ripple execs, the outspoken CTO does not majorly comment on the ongoing lawsuit on social media. He focuses more on the company\u2019s technical aspects and addresses misconceptions about Ripple products.\n\nAs reported by The Crypto Basic, Schwartz debunked circulating rumors that the recently-launched CBDC Platform launched by Ripple would not use XRP.\n\nSEC vs. Ripple Case Approaches End\n\nMeanwhile, many believe the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple, which has lingered for over two years, will soon end.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse speculated that he expects the lawsuit to end in weeks and not months. XRP community members hope that Garlinghouse is right with his prediction and Judge Torres issues a final verdict in a matter of weeks."

        "title": "From Ripple and XRP to Filecoin: The SEC is Simply Illogical - Blockworks",
        "content": "If the crypto industry hadn\u2019t yet appreciated the scale of the danger posed by the SEC\u2019s legal theory at the heart of its long-running lawsuit against Ripple and the XRP token, it seems to have finally hit home for many when news broke about Grayscale\u2019s attempted SEC registration of its Filecoin Trust.\n\nWhen you consider the Grayscale news, the SEC\u2019s recent claim that Algorand constitutes an unregistered security, and the Coinbase Wells notice, the SEC\u2019s war on crypto becomes clear.\n\nAs amicus counsel for 75,000 plus XRP holders, I\u2019ve spent more than two years warning anyone who would listen about the outrageous arguments being made by the SEC.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s central theory in the Ripple case is that the XRP token itself is a security. The allegations are not limited to transactions offered by Ripple or its executives. The SEC is arguing all sales of XRP, regardless of the seller or the circumstances surrounding the sale, constitute the transfer of securities. From the very first one in 2013, onward into perpetuity \u2014 including on the secondary markets between parties who have nothing to do with nor even knowledge of a company called Ripple.\n\nThe SEC based this on the allegation that the \u201cvery nature\u201d of a digital asset is to be a security and nothing else, making XRP \u201cthe embodiment\u201d of an investment contract with Ripple no matter who holds it, uses it or sells it.\n\nAnyone familiar with the Supreme Court\u2019s 1946 Howey decision must concede the SEC\u2019s wildly overreaching argument stretches the so-called Howey test beyond recognition.\n\nThe Howey decision makes clear that the underlying asset itself is not the security, only the scheme by which it is packaged and sold. That 1946 case was about investments in Florida orange groves being sold with the promise of profits from the harvesting and sale of the oranges they produced. The investment scheme in the groves was the security, not the oranges.\n\nBeginning with XRP and theoretically expanding to every digital asset, the SEC has embarked on turning the Howey test on its head. For the first time since 1946, the oranges are now the securities.\n\nTo illustrate the Filecoin Trust situation through that prism, the agency\u2019s lawyers are starting to chase after the grocers who are selling the oranges in a nearby town. That is how absurd this has become.\n\nGiven how the SEC has treated secondary market sales of XRP in the Ripple case, those proverbial grocers now can\u2019t claim innocence by proving they\u2019d bought the oranges from a middleman and not the Howey company.\n\nUnder the SEC\u2019s new legal theory on cryptocurrencies, those oranges are forever tied to the Howey investment and are thus, always illegal. That is, in effect, what just happened to Grayscale.\n\nJust like it did in the run-up to suing Ripple over XRP, the SEC is not going to find a path for registering Filecoin as a security because there is no real way to register an asset that has practical utility on a decentralized file sharing network. Logic simply does not enter the SEC\u2019s thinking.\n\nNor will the agency help Grayscale register Filecoin Trust as an investment company if it separately sues the Filecoin Foundation. No digital asset will ever \u201ccome into compliance,\u201d because that isn\u2019t the SEC\u2019s goal. How does one even attempt to register a line of digital code existing within software?\n\nInstead, the SEC will continue to exploit every chance it has to drag every crypto entity into court by arguing every possible digital asset to be a security under its embodiment theory.\n\nEither through bankrupting settlements or draining hundreds of millions of dollars out of targets in long, drawn out cases, the SEC\u2019s only goal is to get the entire crypto space under its regulatory thumb no matter who gets harmed in the process. It certainly doesn\u2019t care about harming the retail investors they claim to be protecting.\n\nJohn E.
