        "content": "Ripple aims to expand in UK and Europe after win in US court.\n\nCompany still sees US as its global hub, and \u201cwe are going to continue growing exponentially\u201d in Europe and the UK.\n\nRipple is aiming for a spot on the UK\u2019s register of crypto companies, seizing on the region after a favourable court ruling against the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSendi Young, the crypto payments giant\u2019s European managing director, told DL News it had \u201cvery recently\u201d applied for registration as a crypto asset firm with the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, and is preparing for a payment institution licence in Ireland.\n\nNOW READ: Ripple judge signals crypto rules won\u2019t mimic those for stocks and bonds: \u2018More of a win than I was expecting\u2019\n\nRipple is riding high after a US judge ruled on July 13 that its sales of cryptocurrency XRP do not constitute investment contracts, boosting the token\u2019s value by about 60% in the subsequent week.\n\nInvestors have interpreted the ruling as a sign that crypto may not fall under traditional regulations for trading stocks and bonds.\n\nNOW READ: SEC\u2019s probe of puny BarnBridge DAO augurs deep DeFi crackdown\n\nYoung said the decision was a \u201chuge win\u201d and \u201cpositive for [the company\u2019s] growth in the US.\u201d\n\nStill, she added: \u201cWe haven\u2019t turned around and said, \u2018Let\u2019s stop hiring in the UK.\u2019 Our strategy and growth plans are intact and in place.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of applying for our crypto asset registration in the UK and our payments licence in Ireland. These are all massive investments with a view that we are going to continue growing exponentially in this region.\u201d\n\nYoung declined to offer a numerical target for Ripple\u2019s growth plans in the UK and Europe, but confirmed that the firm was still increasing its headcount and hiring for more than mission-critical roles.\n\nRipple has increased its UK and European employees by about 75% in the last 18 months, and now has more than 100 of about 900 global employees based in its offices in London, Dublin, and Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\nNOW READ: EU crypto chief vows to \u2018strike the right balance\u2019 as officials begin enforcing landmark MiCA law\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited to see the momentum ... The UK is starting to make good on its promises to try to be this investment hub for crypto space.\u201d\n\nThe US ruling was not an unqualified success for Ripple, and a trial is to follow.\n\nAnalysing the result for DL News, Stephen Palley, a partner at Brown Rudnick\u2019s Digital Commerce group, said it meant institutional sales were still securities transactions, while programmatic sales and distributions to employees were not.\n\nThat may eventually affect banks\u2019 sales of crypto products, including derivatives. The court \u201cpunts\u201d on whether secondary market sales are securities transactions, he added.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously threatened to relocate the business outside of the US, should the SEC lawsuit not settle in the company\u2019s favour.\n\nIn 2020, he suggested the firm could move to the UK.\n\nNOW READ: Meeting Gensler\u2019s demands \u2014 how one crypto exchange took the \u2018long complicated route\u2019 to register with the SEC\n\nYoung said that Ripple\u2019s position \u201chas not changed\u201d on the US as its global hub, but added that in the roughly two years since the SEC lawsuit was lodged, most of the firm\u2019s expansion \u201chas happened outside the US. I would only expect that the US will pick up and grow a lot more now.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, we are global, we have over 15 offices around the world,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have made significant investment even way before the SEC filed a lawsuit because we look at demand, we look at where the opportunities are, and APAC is a very strong market, EMEA is obviously a very strong market. Our growth around the world will continue.\u201d\n\nSpeaking more broadly about a recent crackdown on crypto firms by the SEC, Young said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always found that regulation by enforcement is not a very productive and useful approach to encourage innovation or attract investment.\u201d\n\nShe added that other jurisdictions including the UK and EU are \u201cseeing this uncertainty in the US as an opportunity to step up and grab their share of these global companies.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of this article quoted Young as referring to the SEC\u2019s \u201cenforcement by action.\u201d Ripple clarified and the article has been amended to reflect that Young meant \u201cregulation by enforcement.\u201d Ripple also clarified that it has not yet applied for a licence in Ireland, but that it is preparing to apply."

        "title": "A Stumbling Block in the SEC\u2019s Crypto Crackdown: SEC v. Ripple Labs, Inc. | Insights - Vinson & Elkins LLP",
        "content": "On July 13, 2023, a decision by Federal District Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York dealt a significant blow to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s enforcement efforts in the crypto space by holding that Ripple Labs, Inc.\u2019s sale of crypto tokens on public exchanges was not a sale of unregistered securities because, in that situation, the tokens themselves were not securities. 1 While the decision is undoubtedly a win for the crypto industry, Judge Torres did side with the SEC on one of the three categories of sales under consideration, holding that Ripple did sell unregistered securities when it sold the same crypto tokens directly to institutional investors. 1 The SEC seems likely to appeal the decision, which will surely not be the last word on the critical question of when cryptocurrency constitutes a \u201csecurity\u201d subject to regulation under the federal securities laws. And, further, other courts charged with determining similar issues could come to different conclusions.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP Sales and the Howey Test\n\nIn 2020, the SEC brought an enforcement action against Ripple, alleging that the firm had sold its XRP crypto tokens as unregistered securities in violation of the securities laws. Relying on well-established precedent from SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 2 the SEC argued that Ripple\u2019s sales of XRP qualified as investment contracts and, thus, as securities subject to the SEC\u2019s registration requirements. In her July 13th decision, Judge Torres rejected a significant portion of the SEC\u2019s argument.\n\nUnder the Howey test, XRP would be sold as investment contracts if a purchaser \u201c(1) invests his money (2) in a common enterprise and (3) is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\u201d Applying Howey, the Court considered three different categories of Ripple\u2019s XRP sales:\n\nProgrammatic Sales: Ripple sold roughly $757.6 million of XRP through different digital asset exchanges. These sales were typically \u201cblind bid/ask transactions,\u201d where buyers and sellers conducted transactions through trading algorithms that did not identify the buyer or seller of the tokens. Institutional Sales: Ripple sold roughly $728.9 million of XRP directly to institutional investors, such as hedge funds or institutional buyers. Other Distributions: Ripple distributed XRP as a form of payment for third-party services and employee compensation.\n\nThe Court considered each of the three transaction categories under Howey and, ultimately, concluded that the Programmatic Sales and Other Distributions were not investment contracts, while the Institutional Sales were investment contracts. The Court also concluded that XRP sales on digital asset exchanges by Ripple\u2019s Chairman Christian Larsen and CEO Bradley Garlinghouse were not investment contracts.\n\nProgrammatic Sales On Public Exchanges Are Not Investment Contracts\n\nIn a major win for the crypto industry, the Court held that the Programmatic Sales on public exchanges were not investment contracts and thus were not subject to the SEC\u2019s registration requirements. It reasoned that these XRP sales did not pass the third element of the Howey test, in that the programmatic purchasers could not \u201creasonably expect that Ripple would use the capital it received from its [programmatic] sales to improve the XRP ecosystem and thereby the price of XRP.\u201d Importantly, the Programmatic Sales were \u201cblind bid/ask transactions,\u201d and thus the purchasers would not have known if their money went to Ripple or any other seller of XRP. Ripple\u2019s own sales of XRP accounted for less than 1% of the global trading volume of XRP, so a purchaser could not reasonably predict if its purchase money went to Ripple or any other seller.\n\nWhile the SEC tried to argue that the Programmatic Sales of XRP were an investment contract since Ripple \u201cexplicitly targeted speculators,\u201d the Court rejected this argument, holding that a purchaser\u2019s potentially speculative motive was not in and of itself enough to show the existence of an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d under the securities laws.\n\nFurther, the Court reasoned that the Programmatic Sales were not made pursuant to any contracts restricting the resale or end-use of the crypto tokens. Thus, these purchasers could have been buying XRP for either investment purposes or for consumptive purposes, such as use as a currency. Finally, there was no evidence that Ripple sent broadly to the general public any promotional materials that linked its business efforts to the success of XRP.\n\nLike Ripple\u2019s Programmatic Sales, Larsen\u2019s and Garlinghouse\u2019s XRP sales on various digital asset exchanges, also through blind bid/ask transactions, were programmatic sales. Accordingly, the Court held that these sales were likewise not investment contracts under the third element of the Howey test.\n\nSales To Institutional Investors Are Investment Contracts\n\nOn the other hand, the Court held that the Institutional Sales met every element of the Howey test and therefore the XRP tokens were securities in that context, and thus their sale was an unregistered offer and sale of securities. With respect to the third element, the Court held that institutional investors \u201cwould have purchased XRP [from Ripple] with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple\u2019s efforts.\u201d In support of this conclusion, the Court cited Ripple\u2019s distribution of marketing materials to potential investors that tied Ripple\u2019s business model to the success of the XRP currency, with one brochure stating that Ripple\u2019s \u201cbusiness model is predicated on a belief that demand for XRP will increase . . . if the Ripple protocol becomes widely adopted.\u201d In addition, the Court noted a Reddit post from one of Ripple\u2019s own senior leaders stating that Ripple\u2019s interests were closely tied to those of XRP holders and that Ripple had a \u201cteam of dedicated professionals\u201d that are \u201cdevelop[ing] an ecosystem around XRP.\u201d Similarly, Garlinghouse had stated that \u201cRipple is very, very interested in the success and health of the [XRP] ecosystem and will continue to invest in the ecosystem.\u201d Taking all this evidence together, along with other similar statements, the Court held that institutional investors would have clearly understood that Ripple was promoting XRP as a way to generate income it would then invest in the ecosystem of XRP with the goal of increasing its value.\n\nFurther, the Court found that the sales contracts between Ripple and institutional investors demonstrated that institutional investors were purchasing XRP as an investment rather than for consumptive use. These contracts had certain \u201clockup provisions\u201d and \u201cresale restrictions\u201d that were inconsistent with the use of XRP as a currency or any other consumptive purpose. For example, one contract stated that the institutional investor was purchasing XRP \u201csolely to resell or otherwise distribute\u201d rather than use XRP as an end user.\n\nOther Distributions Are Not Investment Contracts\n\nThe Court held that the Other Distributions were not investment contracts, but for a different reason than the Programmatic Sales. According to Judge Torres, these distributions did not satisfy the first prong of the Howey test (i.e., investment of money) since the XRP recipients did not invest any money or other \u201ctangible and definable consideration\u201d to receive their crypto tokens.\n\nA Dramatic Response and An Uncertain Future\n\nThis first-of-its-kind case is a significant obstacle for the SEC\u2019s recent crackdown on the crypto industry and has so far proven to be a boon for crypto investors. In the immediate wake of the decision, the price of XRP rose substantially, and many crypto exchanges have taken steps to relist XRP for trading in the U.S.\n\nBut the decision\u2019s long-term impact remains to be seen. While the SEC has stated that it is still assessing the Court\u2019s holding as it relates to the Programmatic Sales, it may well seek to appeal the decision. SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently noted that he was disappointed in this aspect of the Court\u2019s ruling, and emphasized that the SEC will continue its enforcement focus in the crypto space. In addition, while influential, the decision is not binding on other judges, and other courts faced with the issue of when crypto tokens are securities within the meaning of the federal securities laws \u2014 such as the judges considering the SEC\u2019s recent actions against several crypto trading platforms \u2014 could come out a different way. Accordingly, crypto investors and industry participants should continue to proceed with caution and monitor further developments in this quickly evolving area of the law.\n\n1 SEC v.
