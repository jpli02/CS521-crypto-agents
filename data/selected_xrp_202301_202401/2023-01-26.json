        "content": "The cryptocurrency community has raised flags about a new fraud targeting XRP (XRP) investors via a phoney staking scheme.\n\nOnline fraudsters are mimicking big cryptocurrency organisations like Ripple and Binance by constructing phoney websites and email imposters promising to provide staking services for XRP.\n\nOne of these websites has a blog post with the headline \"XRP staking slated to debut January 2023 for retail customers,\" in which users are invited to \"stake\" their XRP in exchange for returns on investment (ROI) that are implausibly high and range from 12 to 27 percent.\n\nBy claiming that a better return on investment (ROI) would be given to just the first 10,000 accounts, the fraudulent scam makes an effort to hasten the decision-making process of XRP investors.\n\nThe phoney website offers an accurate clone of Ripple's website, ripple.com, by reproducing the actual website's style and typefaces and connecting to some of Ripple's earlier blog articles.\n\nThe impersonators also sought to add more credibility to their postings by including information on the significance of self-custody utilising major hardware wallets, such as Ledger or Trezor. This was done in an effort to make the posts seem more legitimate.\n\nThe fraudulent website has a large number of mirror domains, many of which finish in \".org.th\" or \".com.ve,\" and it is designed to defraud users of XRP from all over the globe.\n\nImposter letters purporting to be from Binance and claiming a return on investment (ROI) of up to 31% can be seen accompanying the fraudulent XRP staking website.\n\nOn January 21, a member of the industry who goes by the handle RipplePandaXRP came to Twitter to alert the XRP community of a fraud. \" Do not transmit your XRP to an unknown address, and always verify the address to determine if it is a legitimate site,\" RipplePandaXRP said in a post on its website.\n\nHaving said that, the genuine Binance exchange does, in fact, include decentralised finance (DeFi) staking for XRP into its Binance Earn programme.\n\nOn the other hand, the XRP DeFi staking scheme that Binance offers only enables users to make up to 1.4% annually.\n\nIt is essential to keep in mind that XRP does not employ a proof-of-stake (PoS) method like other prominent proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, such as Ether. As a result, XRP cannot be staked (ETH).\n\nInstead, the processing of XRP transactions is dependent on a network of \"unique nodes\" that reach a consensus over which transactions may be executed inside the network.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock\n\n. . .\n\nTags"

        "content": "RECOMMENDED\n\nIn the United States, there has always been massive resistance regarding the equitable use of public utilities. During the 1950s through 1970s, soldiers prevented Black students from going to public school, Black citizens were arrested for using public transportation and municipalities drained their public swimming pools rather than open them to Black residents.\n\nMany consider the Jim Crow era to be the nadir of racism in America, which is why uplifting stories set during this period stand out.\n\nOne such story is \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home,\u201d about a family from the fictional town of Beacon, Kansas, whose struggles with segregation nearly tear them apart. The play is written by Christina Anderson\u2014a 2022 Tony Award nominee for Outstanding Book for \u201cParadise Square\u201d\u2014who drew inspiration from the book \u201cContested Waters: A Social History of Swimming Pools in America\u201d by Jeff Wiltse. In the director\u2019s chair is Jackson Gay, who also directed the work during its premiere in 2022.\n\nIn 1992, Janice (Christiana Clark) struggles to reconcile the past with the present. In the 1960s, Janice\u2019s parents, Edwin (Ronald L. Conner) and Helen (Aneisa Hicks), are on the front lines of the civil rights movement, their battleground the Brookside public pool. Their persistent struggle ostracizes young Janice, who, as a teenager, chooses to live instead on Aunt Gayle\u2019s (Brianna Buckley) rural farm.\n\nFlash forward and the acquittal of four police officers involved in the beating of Rodney King leaves Janice questioning whether progress has really been achieved, and if it was worth the dissolution of her family\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t help but feel the countless times they chose the movement, not me.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Brookside swimming pool is being reopened and named after her now-deceased father. But what about her mother? Throughout the story, Helen grapples with social injustice, the strained relationship with her daughter, and endures a sexual assault by a police officer (performed abstractly through movement and the sound of intense breathing). If anyone\u2019s name should be on that building, it\u2019s Helen\u2019s, and this leaves Janice torn between feelings of resentment and admiration.\n\nEvery member of the cast adeptly develops their characters with a smoothness that makes it seem like they are really family. Brianna Buckley delivers a standout performance as both Aunt Gayle and Young Chipper Ambitious Black Woman\u2014yes, that\u2019s the character\u2019s name\u2014and defines them both so solidly that it is hard to believe that they were played by the same person.\n\nSet design by Todd Rosenthal is spectacular. The take on a public pool couldn\u2019t be more realistic\u2014emerald tiles display years of grime, mildew stains creep down the walls, water pipes really work! Jumping between eras is made easier to follow through period-specific costuming by Montana Levi Blanco and hair and wigs by Cookie Jordan.\n\nIn 2023, due to white flight from cities following desegregation, our society is more segregated than we were in 1923. In \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home,\u201d we are reminded of how hard people have to fight to enact even gradual progressive change. We are also reminded that their struggle makes every victory seem that much more impressive.\n\n\u201cthe ripple, the wave that carries us home\u201d Goodman, Owen Theatre, 170 North Dearborn.

        "title": "China's Economic Slowdown Could Have Ripple Effect Across World: Report - NDTV",
        "content": "According to China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the annual GDP growth of the country fell to 3 per cent, much below the 5.5 per cent official target in 2022 and its economic slowdown has the potential to generate ripple effects across the world, reported Financial Post.\n\nThe concerns and challenges facing China and the global economy were well articulated by Liu He, the vice-premier of the People's Republic of China, while speaking at the World Economic Forum at Davos 2023.\n\n\"Over the past five years, we have experienced all kinds of unexpected events, and witnessed profound changes in the world's political and economic landscape. Therefore, the theme of this year's Annual Meeting, 'Cooperation in a Fragmented World', cannot be more relevant,\" He said.\n\n\"The Covid-19 pandemic punctured China's growth saga. China's GDP growth was also slightly lower than forecasts published by the IMF in October 2022. IMF predictions expected a GDP growth rate of around 4.4 percent.USD 18 trillion in 2021 mainly due to a sharp rise of the dollar against RMB. This is the slowest growth of the Chinese economy since the 2.3 per cent registered in GDP in 1974,\" reported Financial Post.\n\nObservers were already talking about China falling into the middle-income trap and now, evidence has come to light that the country is finding it hard to keep its miracle of sustained higher growth rates anywhere closer to 10 per cent or more recorded during the late 1980s and the whole of 1990's.\n\nKim Byung-yeon, author and a professor of economics and head of the Institute for Future Strategy at Seoul National University succinctly argued that \"the Chinese economy is slipping into the middle-income-country trap.\"\n\nAccording to Kim, productivity that determines the long-term growth rate has sunken sharply in the case of China.\n\nThe downward trend has deepened since 2014. China's fast growth over the past 15 years stemmed largely from the infrastructure investment to build factories, housing and roads - and less from structural reform and innovation. Extensive growth led by capital and labor input is not sustainable, reported Financial Post.\n\nThe sharp decline in the Chinese GDP growth in 2022 was blamed on a host of factors mainly China shutting itself from the outside world due to the 'Zero Covid' policy. The slow pace was blamed mainly on the strictly 'Zero Covid' policy, leading to periodic lockdowns and the ruling Communist Party's crackdown on big industrial firms besides the lingering real estate crisis.\n\nThe most disturbing fact that comes out from the NBS data is that China, the so called 'manufacturing hub' of the world recorded a very feeble growth in industrial output at 3.6 per cent year-on-year in 2022 and even feebler at 1.3 per cent in the month of December. Zhu Hong, a senior NBS statistician, highlighted a rebound in COVID outbreaks and lackluster demand in November that curbed industrial production and placed increasing pressure on Chinese businesses.\n\nAccording to him, the factors that weighed on slow industrial growth included a squeeze in profits both from anti-virus curbs in big manufacturing hubs such as Guangzhou and Zhengzhou, and from the persistent weight of a protracted property crisis and slowing exports, reported Financial Post.\n\nNBS data in November 22 showed that profits fell for 21 of 41 major industrial sectors, with the ferrous metals smelting and pressing industry suffering the steepest decline, at 94.5 per cent. That compares with a 92.7 per cent fall for the first 10 months.\n\nAnother reason for the industrial slowdown is that many Chinese companies are also facing western sanctions including those in the US, especially against the Chinese tech companies which allegedly breach data security and steal patents.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said at the World Economic Forum (WEF) that he was 'deeply concerned' about the Chinese government's artificial intelligence program, asserting that it was \"not constrained by the rule of law.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

        "title": "Giant polarization ripple in transverse pyroelectricity - Nature.com",
        "content": "TPG fabrication and characterization\n\nA ferroelectric PVDF (Fils Co., Ltd.) thin film with a dimension of 30 mm \u00d7 30 mm \u00d7 80 \u03bcm was used for solar heat harvesting. The top and bottom sides of PVDF thin film were deposited with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) to form a typical sandwich-structured parallel plate capacitor (i.e., PEDOT/PVDF/PEDOT). Two copper tapes (width, 2 mm; thickness, 50 \u03bcm) were affixed to the bottom and top surfaces of PVDF separately for electrically conductive wires. To enhance the solar-to-heat absorption, carbon nanotubes (CNT) solar absorber was coated on the top side of PVDF device using the evaporation coating method, and details can be found in the previous work8. Besides, inorganic ferroelectric thin films PMN 0.7 PT 0.3 (KJMTI) were deposited with Au electrodes on the upper and bottom surfaces. The CNT solar absorber was prepared, and electrically conductive wires were attached to the inorganic thin films PMN 0.7 PT 0.3 and PZT (Daobo Ultrasonics), following the as-mentioned methods. After that, a single device was mounted onto a squared-matched hollow acrylic cantilever for measurement. Moreover, the absorbance and transmittance spectra of PVDF, PVDF/CNT, and acrylic Fresnel lens were obtained using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The morphology of the Fresnel lens was characterized using a microscope camera (HY3307B, HAYEAR).\n\nThermal and electrical measurement of TPG\n\nThe thermal and electrical measurement of TPG were conducted simultaneously in a homemade semi-closed system (Supplementary Fig. 1), where a Xenon lamp (CEL-PE300E-3A, CEAULIGHT), an infrared camera (E50, FLIR Systems), as well as an electrometer (6514, Keithley) were positioned in a semi-closed moisture-proof cabinet (controlled temperature and relative humidity). The Xenon lamp was utilized as a solar simulator with an illumination intensity of ~ 2.5 to 15.0 mW cm\u22122 (maximum value of 125.0 mW cm\u22122) under room temperature (~ 28 \u00b0C) and relativity humidity (~ 60%). The solar irradiation intensity was measured by a solar power meter (1333 R, TES). An electronic shutter (GCI-73, Daheng Optics) and Fresnel lens were introduced into the light trace for modulating the heating/cooling time duration and incident intensity magnification (M). The heating/cooling time duration ratio was fixed at 0.5 (light on, 30 s; light off, 60 s) for the whole test. The back image distance (lens-device distance) is tunable for intensity magnification manipulation. The whole area of Fresnel lens and device remains consistent. The electrometer, coupled with LabVIEW software, was used to record the electrical output variation continuously over time. The maximum input/measurable voltage of the electrometer was \u00b1210 V. Beyond the measurable voltage range, the device was connected to a matched resistor, and the voltage was indirectly calculated by the measured current. Besides, the FLIR camera below the pyroelectric device and FLIR Tools+ software were used to capture the infrared image and surface temperature. The temperature data used in this work is the average value processed from the illumination area of the device. Each measurement was performed under 10 cycles of temporal heating/cooling controlled by the electronic shutter, and the error bar was calculated from the standard deviation of peak-to-peak outputs. For the stability and durability test of the developed TPG, the number of cycles was 1000, and the light on/off ratio was 0.5. Here the light on/off time duration and the number of cycles was controlled by an electronic shutter, and other conditions remained consistent with normal device measurement.\n\nFinite element analysis of TPG\n\nThe thermal and electrical characteristics of PVDF-based conventional and TPG devices were performed by the finite element method using COMSOL Multiphysics coupled with Heat Transfer and Electrostatics modules. The measured device dimension and other parameters selected from the COMSOL materials library were utilized in the simulation, as indicated in Supplemental Table 1. The pyroelectric coefficient p(T) = 1.2239E-7T 5 \u2212 4.68522E-5T 4 + 6.16E-3T 3 \u2212 0.32908 T 2 + 6.91557 T, fitted function from as-measured results was used for the analysis. To reveal the heat ripple propagation and dT/dt-induced pyroelectric electrostatics, the solar-heat generation process, i.e., light absorption of device, was simplified into a solid heat transfer model. The input thermal energy from the solar incident irradiation was approximated to a heat penetration depth with a consideration of PVDF/CNT absorbance, defined as the boundary heat source (\\({q}_{{{{{{\\rm{input}}}}}}}\\) is 10 mW cm\u22122), so the governed equations for instantaneous heat transfer, heat conduction, and heat dissipation are given from a view of the first law of thermodynamics\n\n$$\\rho {C}_{{{{{{\\rm{p}}}}}}}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}+\\rho {C}_{{{{{{\\rm{p}}}}}}}{{{{{\\boldsymbol{u}}}}}} \\cdot\n\nabla T+\n\nabla \\cdot {{{{{{\\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{cond}}}}}}}=Q,$$ (1)\n\n$${{{{{{\\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{cond}}}}}}}=-\\kappa\n\nabla T,$$ (2)\n\nwhere \u03c1 and C p stand for the density and constant-pressure heat capacity, respectively. \\({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{cond}}}}}}}\\) is the quasi-static conductive heat flux, and \u03ba indicates the thermal conductivity of PVDF/CNT thin film. Besides, in view of surface thermal radiation and heat convection with the ambient environment under a semi-closed system, two other equations were introduced\n\n$${{{{{\\boldsymbol{-}}}}}}{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{n}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{rad}}}}}}} \\cdot {{{{{{\\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{rad}}}}}}}=\\varepsilon {\\sigma }_{{{{{{\\rm{SB}}}}}}}\\left({T}_{{{{{{\\rm{amb}}}}}}}^{4}-{T}^{4}\\right),$$ (3)\n\n$$-{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{n}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{conv}}}}}}} \\cdot {{{{{{\\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{conv}}}}}}}=h\\left({T}_{{{{{{\\rm{amb}}}}}}}-T\\right),$$ (4)\n\nwhere \u03b5 and \u03c3 SB refer to the surface emissivity and Stefan-Boltzmann constant, respectively. T amb and T are the ambient and PVDF-based device temperatures, h donates the heat convection coefficient. \\({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{n}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{rad}}}}}}}\\) and \\({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{rad}}}}}}}\\) represent the thermal radiation vector direction and radiative heat flux, respectively; similarly, \\({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{n}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{conv}}}}}}}\\) and \\({{{{{{\\boldsymbol{q}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\bf{conv}}}}}}}\\) are the heat convection vector direction and convective heat flux. In contrast to uniform heat variation (M \u2261 1), the TPG confines the incident solar absorption into a focused hotspot, and the input total thermal power density was tuned by the magnification factor (M = A/a = 71.7).\n\nMacroscopic mechanism from heat transfer\n\nTo understand how the pyroelectric output governed by the macroscopic heat transfer along the transverse and longitudinal directions, we developed a temperature-dependent model by employing the measured device\u2019s parameters. Concerning the macroscopic thermodynamics in the pyroelectric device, the fluctuation in dT/dt and \u0394T of the device is expressed as39,40\n\n$${\\eta }_{{{{{{\\rm{abs}}}}}}}\\left({q}_{{{{{{\\rm{i}}}}}}}{aM}\\right)={C}_{{{{{{\\rm{H}}}}}}}{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}T/{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}t+{G}_{{{{{{\\rm{T}}}}}}}\\Delta T,$$ (5)\n\nwhere \\({\\eta }_{{{{{{\\rm{abs}}}}}}}\\) is the solar absorbance (%) of the device, \\({q}_{{{{{{\\rm{i}}}}}}}\\) and a are the incident illumination intensity and irradiation area respectively, C H and G T are the heat capacitance of pyroelectric materials and thermal conductance between the device and sample holder. Considering the device directly contacts with the ambient air (practical measurement), then the G T can be derived from Newton\u2019s law of cooling and given as\n\n$${G}_{{{{{{\\rm{T}}}}}}}={hA}.$$ (6)\n\nIn view of intermittence time-dependent temperature fluctuations, C H can be rewritten to \u03baA\u0394t/l for a given small \u0394t from Fourier\u2019s law of heat conduction at quasi-static conditions (i.e., \u0394T = dT at \u0394t = dt). Consequently, with the introduction of pyroelectric charge from a temperature gradient, i.e., Q = pA\u0394T, the Eq. (5) is given by\n\n$${\\eta }_{{{{{{\\rm{abs}}}}}}}({q}_{i}{aM})=\\frac{(\\kappa /l+h)Q}{p},$$ (7)\n\nwhich is independent of the device area A, and the pyroelectric charge is given as\n\n$$Q=p({\\eta }_{{{{{{\\rm{abs}}}}}}}{q}_{i}{aM}){(\\kappa /l+h)}^{-1}.$$ (8)\n\nInterestingly, the first bracket in Eq. (8) remains stationary since the total absorbed solar power \\(({\\eta }_{{{{{{\\rm{abs}}}}}}}{q}_{i}{aM})\\) is identical, constant, and M-independent for conventional (A \u2261 aM and M \u2261 1, i.e., A \u2261 a), as well as thermal ripple induced pyroelectricity (A \u2261 aM and M > 1, i.e., A > a while A is constant). These results were verified in the finite element modelling as well (Supplementary Fig. 9f). However, in terms of the second bracket of Eq. (8), i.e., the macroscopic heat transfer, in which the heat propagation/redistribution impacts the local temperature profile and heat conduction length (l) at the device, resulting in distinctive P S and Q. Specifically, the decoupled solar heat confinement and spatial self-propagating thermal ripple fluctuation arising from the quasi-static anomalous conductive heat flux towards thermodynamic disequilibrium. This benefits the in-plane heat perturbation of TPG with a large heat conduction length (l = (w - d a )/2, w is the width of the device), thus facilitating the boosted surface charge density in the local irradiation area (a). By contrast, the solar heat dissipates simultaneously and uniformly at the entire conventional device (A) following the out-of-plane direction with a slight heat conduction length (d 0 , the device thickness) and relatively low polarization. In other words, the pyroelectric charges of conventional and TPG devices are modulated by a distinctive heat transfer diagram, and the harvested charge under corresponding heat conduction lengths can be written as\n\n$$Q=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}p\\cdot {\\eta }_{{{{{{\\rm{abs}}}}}}}{q}_{{{{{{\\rm{i}}}}}}}A\\cdot {\\left(\\frac{\\kappa }{l}+h\\right)}^{-1},\\left(l={d}_{0},\\,{Conventional}\\right)\\, \\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!p\\cdot {\\eta }_{{{{{{\\rm{abs}}}}}}}\\left({q}_{{{{{{\\rm{i}}}}}}}M\\right)a\\cdot {\\left(\\frac{\\kappa }{l}+h\\right)}^{-1},\\left(l=\\frac{w-{d}_{{{{{{\\rm{a}}}}}}}}{2},{TPG}\\right)\\end{array},\\right.$$ (9)\n\nin which the Q of the conventional device is proportional to solar intensity and device area while independent of M, this is the generality of conventional pyroelectrics, where the input solar heat is coupled with the heat delivery in the entire device37. In contrast, the overall solar illumination is governed by M and incident intensity (\\({q}_{{{{{{\\rm{i}}}}}}}\\)), leading to an upgrading pyroelectric output as the M nonlinearly varies with the illumination area (a) (Supplementary Fig. 12c), although the total received solar power is identical to the conventional design.\n\nLattice dynamics of transverse pyroelectricity\n\nOn the other hand, the focused quasi-static conductive heat flux and temperature-dependent \\(p\\) at the confined irradiation area are enlarged synergistically by the tuneable magnification for thermal ripple mediated pyroelectrics (Fig. 4c). To uncover the in-depth microscopic fundamentals of transverse pyroelectricity (i.e., the origin of polarization and pyroelectricity (\\(p\\) in Eq. (8)), and the temperature dependence behaviours) beyond above-mentioned macroscopic understandings, we provided additional discussion based upon lattice dynamics and thermodynamics of pyroelectricity. According to the phenomenological theory of the free energy of a lattice35, the electric polarization (P) is the \u201cforce\u201d conjugate to the known \u201cthermal electric field\u201d (-E), so the observed P under a finite temperature (T) can be obtained from the derivative of free energy (F) of unit volume of a free crystal with respect to -E\n\n$${P}_{{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}}\\left(T\\right)=-{\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial E}\\right)}_{{{{{{\\rm{T}}}}}}}.$$ (10)\n\nUsing Eq. (10), the primary pyroelectric coefficient (under external constant strain but internal vibrating lattice, i.e., \u201cclamped-lattice\u201d pyroelectricity, in which the pyroelectricity associated with external thermal expansion/deformation induced piezoelectricity is negligible) is directly governed by the lattice dynamics and can be written by\n\n$$p\\left(T\\right)=\\frac{\\partial {P}_{{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}}}{\\partial T}.$$ (11)\n\nTo find the origin of primary pyroelectric effect and its temperature-dependent variation (initially discussed by Boguslawski in 1914 and named \u201cmonochromatic\u201d theory), tremendous efforts have been made during the past century. Based on the understanding of lattice dynamical theory, Born had indicated that the primary pyroelectricity in the ion crystals originates from the harmonic variation of ions, in which the electronic renormalization (when dT/dt > 0) owing to thermal vibrations (i.e., electron-phonon renormalization) with respect to the original state (when dT/dt = 0), and the dipole moment contribution is proportional to the mean square amplitude of oscillations30. However, the role of mechanical and electrical anharmonicity in primary pyroelectricity was thought as \u201csecondary important\u201d in Born\u2019s discussion. Thirty years later, in 1975, Szigeti complemented the anharmonic potential (i.e., the mean displacement of atoms with respect to rigid ions, also known as the internal strain term) into Born\u2019s solution and proved its nonnegligible contribution to primary pyroelectricity34. Therefore, in accordance with Born-Szigeti theory of pyroelectricity and expanding the \\({P}_{{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}}\\left(T\\right)\\) with respect to the normal mode amplitudes (\\(\\xi\\)), the overall primary pyroelectric coefficient can be given as\n\n$$p\\left(T\\right)={p}_{1}+{p}_{2}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{a}\\frac{\\partial {P}_{{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}}}{\\partial {\\xi }_{a}}\\frac{d\\left\\langle {\\xi }_{a}\\right\\rangle }{{dT}}+\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j}\\frac{{\\partial }^{2}{P}_{{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}}}{\\partial {\\xi }_{j}^{2}}\\frac{d\\left\\langle {\\xi }_{j}^{2}\\right\\rangle }{{dT}},$$ (12)\n\nwhere \\({p}_{1}\\) is the first-order primary coefficient ascribed to rigid-ion contribution (induced by the mean displacement of ions carrying Born effective charge), \\({p}_{2}\\) is the second-order primary coefficient owing to electron-phonon renormalization (i.e., Debye-Waller term). In the second term (\\({p}_{2}\\)) of the right-hand side of Eq. (12), the mean square displacement associated with all phonon modes and can be expressed by\n\n$$\\left\\langle {\\xi }_{j}^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{{{\\hslash }}}{2}\\frac{2{n}_{j}+1}{{\\omega }_{j}},$$ (13)\n\nin which \\({\\omega }_{j}\\) and \\({n}_{j}\\) refer to the eigenfrequency and the Bose-Einstein distribution, respectively. For a simple estimation, the \\({\\omega }_{j}\\) can be represented by using phonon frequency. Here, in terms of transverse pyroelectricity, the microscopic mechanism of how the achieved giant performance associated with the primary pyroelectric coefficient that increases under rising temperatures can be ascribed to the temperature dependence of \\(\\langle {\\xi }_{a}\\rangle\\) and/or \\(\\langle {\\xi }_{j}^{2}\\rangle\\). In recent years, the contribution of electron-phonon renormalization (\\({p}_{2}\\)) to pyroelectricity has been overlooked as negligible in traditional views, is found to be significant2. In particular, it is revealed that the \\(\\langle {\\xi }_{j}^{2}\\rangle\\) increased linearly with respect to temperature owing to decreasing frequency of phonons of thick and thin films in various material systems2,5,31. This conclusion is applicable to proposed transverse pyroelectricity, in which a higher temperature benefits to increase \\(\\langle {\\xi }_{j}^{2}\\rangle\\) that contributed from optical modes and therefore improving the \\({p}_{2}\\), especially for non-uniform polarization33. Meanwhile, the unprecedented temperature ripple travelling along the transverse direction in TPG offers nonnegligible internal strain (e.g., owing to the variation of unit cell volume31, the rotation of the C-F and C-H bonds in \u03b2-PVDF with temperatures29), thus enabling nonvanishing atomic displacement with respect to ions to contribute the \\({p}_{1}\\). Aside from that, the rigid-ion associated with electron-phonon renormalization and external thermal expansion may play a possible role in the increment of overall transverse pyroelectricity. Although the experimental quantification of how \\({p}_{1}\\) and/or \\({p}_{2}\\) dominates the heat-induced polarization ripple change is still changeable (e.g., anharmonic and harmonic phonon dispersion relations and their temperature dependence, lattice dimensionality, dopant polarizability), the above discussions pave a possible way to understand the lattice dynamics with inhomogeneous heat manipulation and could be of great interests in the future.\n\nOutdoor test of scalable TPG systems\n\nThe outdoor test was conducted at the location of 22\u00b036'30'' N, 113\u00b059'43'' E, the ground behind Block 8, Lychee Hills, Southern University of Science and Technology, with a time duration of 7.30 AM to 5.30 PM, June 16, 2021. The scalable TPG systems (9 units, in parallel) were arranged under tree shadow, and the incident sunlight from wind-driven tree shadow fluctuation facilitated the hotspot variation on the TPG surface. The electrical signal of TPG systems was recorded using a 6514 electrometer. The TPG temperature was monitored at the central position of the TPG system by a temperature datalogger (SSN-61, YUWESE). The irradiation intensity variation was measured using a solar power meter datalogger (1333 R, TES). The ambient temperature, ambient relative humidity, and wind speed were recorded by a hot-wire anemometer (1341, TES). All data were collected simultaneously and connected to a laptop for processing."
