        "content": "BROAD RIPPLE \u2014 We know package thieves like to strike around the holidays, but some neighbors who live at The Reserve At Broad Ripple took action after catching the same person stealing packages on Ring Doorbell Cameras multiple times.\n\nAlexo Cazares has lived at the condominiums for years. He said his neighbors had packages go missing from their garage and parking area for at least ten days.\n\nOn Jan. 1, Cazares, with the help of his three-year-old corgi dog Sushi, left a fake package with his dog\u2019s poop inside instead of a valuable delivery.\n\nHe said \u201c[it's] a little Sushi treat, Sushi\u2019s my dog and he wanted to contribute.\u201d\n\nCazares described seeing the person on camera time and time again.\n\n\u201cShe has the cigarette in her mouth, hoodie up. At first, I thought she was my neighbor\u2019s friend because it\u2019s very nonchalant, just like taking her time,\" Cazares said.\n\nHis Ring camera video shows the woman throwing the package into the backseat of her car and driving away. Cazares said she was \u201cjust like, so confident.\u201d\n\nOn New Year's Day, she grabbed the poopy package.\n\nWhen Cazares said he got the notification on his camera, he jumped out of bed saying \u201cshe\u2019s here, she\u2019s here, this is not a drill.\u201d\n\n\"I got my keys and I\u2019m like I\u2019ve got to get my wallet, got my wallet, got in the car,\" Cazares said.\n\nHe then followed her to Fresh Thyme and took a photo of her.\n\n\"I waved at her because I didn\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m from the Midwest, right? And she waved back,\" he said.\n\nHe said the goal of the fake package was to get her license plate information and report it to police.\n\nWith the info he needed to file a report, his neighbors are calling it a victory.\n\n\u201cFor people it\u2019s frustrating because again they\u2019re stealing packages and it\u2019s kind of personal when you take somebody\u2019s package,\u201d said Cazares.\n\nCazeres said the thief hasn\u2019t targeted their neighborhood anymore.\n\nWe reached out to IMPD to get an updated on this case. Police usually suggest calling 9-1-1 if you see something like this and reporting it, instead of following the person who did it.\n\nThey also said if your packages are stolen you should make a report, and provide detailed information as well as security camera footage of the incident to detectives.\n\nRELATED: 'Operation Cat Poop': The clever way an Indianapolis woman is getting back at porch pirates\n\n"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nProminent member of the XRP community @Wkahneman has shared a link to a recent interview of Navin Gupta \u2014 Ripple's Managing Director for South Asia regions and MENA.\n\nGupta talked about the recent achievements of the company's On-Demand Liquity (ODL) tech in the global market, new startups that are being build in cooperation with Ripple and UAE developers building things on XRPL.\n\nNice interview of #Ripple's Navin Gupta in Zawya. Some interesting points:\n\n-@Ripple working w/ NYU Abu Dhabi on a cluster of startups\n\n-A UAE Dev's are building on #XRPL\n\n-Notes Pyypl & LuLu Money\n\n-ODL in 40 payout markets representing 90% of $6t daily FXhttps://t.co/sP5cWdq0zG \u2014 WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) January 6, 2023\n\nInterest in Ripple's ODL soars in MENA\n\nAccording to Navin Gupta, financial institutions in the MENA region (Middle East and Northern Africa) seek to switch to crypto rails as the region sees a big demand for crypto-based remittances and transnational payments. Some of the local platforms such as Pyypl and LuLu Money are already utilizing ODL to conduct payments between the United Arab Emirates and other locations around the globe.\n\nThe use of remittances in MENA countries at the moment is expanding, according to Ripple's top executive. He expects the company to expand its operations there to match the growing demand.\n\nODL uses Ripple-affiliated XRP cryptocurrency to conduct transnational payments directly between wallets to increase the speed of transfers and bring down their costs.\n\nOverall, Gupta stated that Ripple's ODL tech is now being used in 40 markets and it represents around 90% of the FX market that sees a daily volume of roughly $6 trillion USD.\n\nAside from the above mentioned partners, Ripple collaborates with major banks in MENA, which includes SABB in the UAE and QNB in Qatar.\n\nGupta stressed that by using crypto liquidity, Ripple can create new products for markets that the traditional financial system and its tools cannot reach.\n\nUAE devs building on XRP Ledger\n\nRipple's top executive also shared that the UAE is turning into a crypto hub. More clients are beginning to use Ripple's technology and its benefits, using crypto to conduct remittances.\n\nBesides, per Gupta, the developer ecosystem in the UAE is now blooming since there are a great many prominent crypto companies that are being founded in the country. Some of them are using XRPL to build their apps and can apply to receive a grant either from Ripple itself or from XRPL Foundation.\n\nRipple is also working with NYU Abu Dhabi on creating several startups, which would later activate the local ecosystem."

        "content": "Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo poses for a photo with the jersey after signing with Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr Football Club in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on December 30, 2022. Al Nassr Football Club / Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nSoccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Saudi club Al-Nassr, and the kingdom's growing investments in the sport, could have ripple effects across Europe and the U.S., experts have told CNBC. Ronaldo's two-and-a-half-year contract, reportedly worth up to 200 million euros ($212 million) per year including commercial agreements, will make the 37-year-old the highest-paid footballer in history, and the highest-paid athlete in the world. For context, Ronaldo's individual annual earnings will exceed the total staff wage bill for roughly half of the clubs in the English Premier League. The former Real Madrid, Manchester United and Juventus star earlier this week contended that the \"unique contract\" was befitting of his status as a \"unique player.\" Ronaldo had his contract with Manchester United terminated in November after he gave an explosive interview criticizing the club and its manager, Erik ten Hag. The Portuguese forward's move comes as Saudi Arabia reportedly readies a potential joint bid to stage the 2030 World Cup, and follows the Saudi Public Investment Fund's buyout of historic Premier League club Newcastle United in late 2021. The Financial Times reported in October that the Saudi PIF had committed more than $2 billion to sponsorship deals over the first eight months of 2022, most of which was directed toward domestic soccer competitions.\n\nwatch now\n\nAuthor and soccer finance expert Kieran Maguire told CNBC on Thursday that rather than an effort to rival the major European leagues, Al-Nassr's signing of Ronaldo was a \"marketing exercise\" that enables the kingdom to diversify its commercial appeal beyond natural resources, given the size of the player's individual profile. \"If you take a look at the social media following that somebody of Cristiano Ronaldo's status brings, it's far greater than that of an individual football club,\" Maguire said. \"Saudi Arabia has a young population, so he will attract that generation. There's economic benefits, there's political and societal benefits, and the financial cost is a complete irrelevance.\" Manchester United and Liverpool in Saudi crosshairs? The Saudi PIF's takeover of Newcastle United was met with criticism across the soccer world \u2014 deemed an effort to launder the country's reputation against the backdrop of a poor human rights record. A group called NUFC Fans Against Sportswashing sprung up in protest at the takeover, but having watched their club endure a prolonged spell of mediocrity, many Newcastle fans cheered the investment in the hope of becoming a competitive force in England and beyond. Just 15 months on from the completion of the deal, the club sits third in the Premier League table, sandwiched between perennial giants Manchester City and Manchester United. Saudi officials have consistently denied allegations of sportswashing in their various sporting pursuits, and the Newcastle takeover consortium led by British businesswoman Amanda Staveley insists the PIF is independent from the Saudi government. However, PIF forms the bedrock of the Saudi economic project and its Vision 2030 program. Statements lauding the PIF's progress from King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appear in its annual financial statements. The PIF owns 80% of the club, with the remaining 20% split between Staveley's PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media. The PIF has been contacted for comment. Ownership controversies have also surrounded Premier League champions Manchester City, (owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group) and French champions Paris Saint-Germain (owned by Qatar Sports Investments). Having observed other state-sponsored takeovers over the past decade, along with the success of the contentious FIFA World Cup in Qatar in December, Maguire suggested that Saudi Arabia could look to expand its soccer portfolio in one of two ways. \"PIF could go down a similar route to the UAE in having the City Football Group and going for a multi-club ownership model, where effectively you have a mothership and you have a lot of satellites,\" he suggested. Aside from its flagship club Manchester City, the ADUG's City Football Group now owns nine other clubs across four continents with consistent branding and availability of resources.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"From a financial point of view, that's actually turning out to be quite successful because you can have continuity in terms of culture and philosophy at clubs, you can transfer players around to help their development, and then you can start to sell them at higher prices, so it's actually proven to be, these days, a pretty smart model,\" Maguire added. Alternatively, given the number of high net worth individuals in Saudi Arabia likely to be interested in building on the Newcastle United acquisition, he suggested other high-profile clubs could come into Riyadh's sights. Both Liverpool and Manchester United, arguably the two biggest clubs in England in terms of global profile, have publicly declared that they are open to investment, and possibly even a full sale. \"[The Saudis] have seen the positive response from Newcastle fans \u2014 there are two clubs which are publicly up for some form of investment in Liverpool and Manchester United and no disrespect to Newcastle United, they're much bigger fish,\" he said. \"Sports investment is attractive. You won't necessarily get a substantial return on your investment financially, given the high prices they are likely to have to go and pay for a club of that stature, but the non-financial return on investment as we've seen at both the Etihad (home of Manchester City) and PSG is a positive one.\" Individual star signings model could threaten MLS Credit ratings agency DBRS Morningstar suggested that Ronaldo's move to the Saudi Pro League, and the country's apparent intentions, could imperil the credit risk profiles of European and North American clubs. \"In Europe, as player costs at football clubs are tied to their revenues, increasing individual salaries driven by foreign demand could decrease squad quality over time. This could have a longer-term impact on on-pitch results, brand values, and viewership for teams that are unable to grow revenue and reinvest in their squads,\" said DBRS Morningstar Senior Vice President for Sports Finance Michael Goldberg. Saudi investment has disrupted professional golf in the form of LIV Golf, a breakaway competition from the traditional PGA Tour that utilized Riyadh's deep pockets to draw some of the game's biggest names. However, Goldberg suggested that attracting a handful of superstars in the twilight of their careers to a team sports league would not be sufficient for Saudi Arabia to attract a critical mass of fan interest, since the quality of play would still be considerably lower than in top European leagues. The Saudi model poses more of a threat to the U.S., he noted, since Major League Soccer (MLS) has a long-running strategy of attracting aging star players to build interest and viewership. To this end, each club is permitted to sign three players whose compensation package is excluded from the team's salary cap.\n\nwatch now"
