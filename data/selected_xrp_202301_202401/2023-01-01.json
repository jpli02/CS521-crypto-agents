        "title": "Ripple CTO Explains Why XRP Price Is So Low - U.Today",
        "content": "Ripple CTO David Schwartz believes that the sluggish performance of XRP and other major cryptocurrencies is a result of uncertainty as to whether or not crypto will actually be the next big thing.\n\n\n\nUsing Google in 2000 as an example, Schwartz compares how people may have been skeptical then about how the search engine was going to deliver billions of dollars worth of new wealth, but some became true believers and made millions. He believes that crypto is in a similar situation as of now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, prices often move together as investor sentiment waxes and wanes depending on whether more people become convinced of crypto\u2019s future potential or not. Simply put, \u201cthe markets are still trying to figure out if crypto is going to be the next big thing.\"\n\nTherefore, mass adoption of different crypto technologies could succeed if the industry is able to convince people about crypto\u2019s potential by offering real use cases and a sufficient level of scalability.\n\nAt the same time, Schwartz has stressed that this is just his personal opinion that is not backed up with facts and data. Hence, one is free to disagree with him."

        "content": "Attorney John Deaton has also labeled Bitcoin as security and warned that SEC could soon turn on the digital asset.\n\nEvan Van Ness, an Ethereum maximalist, tweeted that the Bitcoin production block is controlled by two entities.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently in court with Ripple Labs over the security status of XRP. As the case is edging closer to its final ruling, Attorney John Deaton has labeled Bitcoin as security and warned that SEC could soon turn on the digital asset. Evan Van Ness, an Ethereum maximalist tweeted that the Bitcoin production block is controlled by two entities.\n\nMAJORITY OF #Bitcoin BLOCK PRODUCTION CURRENTLY CONTROLLED BY TWO ENTITIES Out of the last 1000 $BTC blocks, 501 have been built by Antpool and FoundryUSA Two pools control more than 50% of block production!\n\nIn response, former SEC enforcement attorney John Reed Stark questioned why the asset is then not regarded as security that requires SEC registration. Stark has suggested that Bitcoin is an unregistered security due to its mining centralization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeaton also responded that the security status of Bitcoin has been a topic of discussion in the past with some SEC officials regarding it as an unregistered security.\n\nThere are others at the SEC who believe the same thing. In 2015, some at the SEC argued BTC was an unregistered security. This is why it\u2019s absurd for Maxi\u2019s like @saylor and @maxkeiser to encourage/celebrate the SEC\u2019s actions \ud83c\udd9a XRP and other tokens. SEC overreach is bad for the USA.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum maximalists\u2019 support for SEC could backfire\n\nDeaton has in the past warned that SEC could turn on Ethereum for switching to Proof of Stake. His mention of Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum proponents comes as a result of their lack of support in the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. Michael Saylor and Max Keiser have both shown support for SEC with Saylor claiming Ethereum and Ripple are committing security fraud.\n\nAccording to him, ETH and XRP are unregistered securities and should be shut down. In the past, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also labeled XRP as centralized. Buterin\u2019s position is due to Ripple\u2019s comment in a court filing two years ago that Ethereum was China controlled. In August, Buterin said XRP has lost its protection from the Ethereum community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeaton, however, believes that the support by the anti-Ripple community and the so-called Bitcoin maximalists could come back to bite them.\n\nPerfect picture summarizes the danger of supporting government overreach just because the current overreach doesn\u2019t involve the asset of your choice.\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, Ripple Labs CEO, has called on the entire crypto community to support them, as a victory for the SEC could affect the rest of the digital assets.\n\nU.S. Congress candidate January Walker also made a similar claim.\n\nThe world follows the actions of the USA, and how the government handles one of us, sets precedence for how they handle all of us. Instead of battling against each other claiming one group is better than another we need to work together for the right legislation.\n\nPresident of the Texas Blockchain Council, Lee Bratcher, however, thinks otherwise. According to him, the XRP model fits the Howey test and should be categorized under security.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "The court hearing of oral argument for its motion against the Securities Exchange and Commission (SEC) remedies was accepted by the court, at the request of Ripple ally LBRY. The next date in the Ripple v SEC case is January 30, 2023.\n\nAll eyes on SEC v Ripple Labs\n\nJohn E Deaton, a crypto lawyer who filed an amicus brief in the LBRY lawsuit, and the SEC v Ripple lawsuit stated in a long Twitter thread, that \u201cThe January 30th hearing regarding @LBRYcom\u2019s Motion to Limit the SEC\u2019s Remedies is arguably the most important crypto hearing to date. The SEC is seeking disgorgement from a non-party but also read the SEC\u2019s proposed language for the permanent injunction.\u201d\n\nMr. Deaton, founder of Crypto-Law.us, mentions his reasons in a long Twitter thread as on December 28, 2022: \u201c1) The SEC is inappropriately seeking punitive disgorgement in a NON-FRAUD case. Judge Netburn in the Ripple case stated that the lawyers at the SEC lacked a faithful allegiance to the law and despite the law, framed legal arguments based solely to advance its desired goals.\u201d\n\nThe January 30th hearing regarding @LBRYcom\u2019s Motion to Limit the SEC\u2019s Remedies is arguably the most important crypto hearing to date.\n\n\n\nThe SEC is seeking disgorgement from a non-party but also read the SEC\u2019s proposed language for the permanent injunction. \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/g6Bi0DdjYP pic.twitter.com/xpLsD1hI5x \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 28, 2022\n\nAt the backstage\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the SEC says Ripple illicitly raised an estimated $1.4 billion by selling XRP, while breaking investor-protection rules. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse and its co-founder Christian Larsen were sued along with the company. The company stated that XRP are meant for enabling global payments and not an investment as claimed by the SEC.\n\nCEO Garlinghouse had acquired almost $160 million between 2017 to 2020 through the sale of XRP. On the other side, co-founder Larsen, who stepped down as CEO in 2016, had earned almost $450 million via sale of XRP between 2015 and 2020, as claimed by the SEC. Despite the SEC\u2019s supervision in 2017, thousands of virtual coins have been sold out illegally avoiding legal monitoring.\n\nAs per sources, SEC said in its filing, that \u201cEven if the SEC were to engage in a belated, post-discovery transaction-by-transaction analysis to identify XRP offers and sales with contracts, its claim would still fail as a matter of law. Not one of those contracts granted post-sale rights to recipients as against Ripple or imposed post-sale obligations on Ripple to act for the benefit of those recipients.\u201d\n\nAccording to a press release published by SEC in October 2020, it stated that \u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that a federal district court has entered a final judgment on consent against Kik Interactive Inc. to resolve the SEC\u2019s charges that Kik\u2019s unregistered offering of digital \u201cKin\u201d tokens in 2017 violated the federal securities laws.\u201d"
