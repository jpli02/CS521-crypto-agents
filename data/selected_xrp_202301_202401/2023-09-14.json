        "content": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says the blockchain-based payments company is seeing more expansive growth outside of the US because of the country\u2019s restrictive stance on crypto.\n\nIn a new interview on Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia, Garlinghouse says the majority of Ripple\u2019s open positions will be filled by people in countries more accommodative to the crypto industry.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s super frustrating that you see markets like we have here in Singapore, certainly even what we\u2019re seeing in Hong Kong, the UK and Dubai, where the governments are partnering with the industry and you\u2019re seeing leadership providing clear rules, that you\u2019re seeing growth. That\u2019s why Ripple is hiring there, 80% of our hiring this year is to be outside the United States.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeks the court\u2019s approval to appeal the groundbreaking ruling that XRP tokens sold to the general public are not securities, Garlinghouse is optimistic that the decision will be favorable to Ripple.\n\n\u201cI said this a long time ago. The facts are on our side and the law is on our side and we\u2019ll continue to prevail in court because of that.\u201d\n\nGarlinghouse says the US may still become the next crypto hub amid the possibility that the regulatory climate in the country will change.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s permanently shut. It\u2019s definitely a tough spot. The US is still the largest economy in the world at 22% of global GDP and so we will have a presidential election. There will be a change or maybe there will be a change\u2026 I think there\u2019ll be some shift as you see new administrations come in. I think, eventually, Congress will be frankly called to act.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Severe Shortage Of Skilled Trades Has Ripple Effect Across Housing Industry - West Virginia Public Broadcasting",
        "content": "West Virginians have struggled to find affordable housing for years. The pandemic made things worse as a surge in home sales left builders unprepared. A lack of available housing inventory, and land on which to build, is exacerbated by a severe shortage of laborers and skilled tradesmen to build the houses.\n\nThe shortage of available housing is affecting a disproportionate number of lower income families across the state. But the solution isn\u2019t as simple as building more houses or offering tax incentives for builders.\n\nEd Brady, CEO of the Home Builders Institute \u2013 a national nonprofit provider of trade skills training and education for the building industry \u2013 said the imbalance of supply and demand has created a confluence of events that are contributing to the problem.\n\n\u201cThe need is at crisis levels, we don\u2019t have skilled labor to build the housing, or infrastructure that we need in this country,\u201d Brady said.\n\nEconomic Downturn\n\nDuring the Great Recession, the residential construction industry lost an estimated 1.5 million jobs. Thousands of home builders went out of business. The road to recovery has been a long one. With fewer workers, rising lumber costs and a limited inventory of raw materials, last year took an average of 8 months to build a single-family home. That is the longest since the Census Bureau began collecting data in 1971.\n\nThe Home Builders Institute actively recruits people in the skilled trades through on the job training and no cost pre-apprenticeship training and certification programs. Brady said their partnership with the Home Depot Foundation helps provide programs across the country that began as an outreach to help transitioning military families.\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019re helping us get into high schools,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThey\u2019re helping us with organizations like 100 Black Men of America, they\u2019re helping us create academies throughout the country. We need to get industry invested in this movement to get more skilled labor. The opportunity for young people, underserved people is there; we just need the funding to help them find a career path like the rest of the country has.\u201d\n\nThe Home Builders Association of West Virginia has six local associations. They include North Central West Virginia Home Builders Association, Southern West Virginia Home Builders Association, Greater Charleston Home Builders Association, Eastern Panhandle Home Builders Association, Northern Panhandle Home Builders Association and the Mid-Ohio Valley Home Builders Association.\n\nThe association\u2019s president Aaron Dickerson said that the severe labor shortage in skilled residential construction is worse in the state\u2019s rural areas.\n\n\u201cHousing affordability and affordable housing kind of goes hand in hand,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cAnd with that, the labor shortage of creating those homes, we\u2019re really trying to draw the manufacturers, the businesses into state but the rural areas where the companies are trying to come to \u2013 it is difficult in finding the construction companies and the labor to provide the affordable housing for the individuals who are going to work on those projects and eventually form the skilled labor for those companies.\u201d\n\nAging Workforce\n\nIn 2022, nearly a quarter of skilled tradesmen were 55 or older. For every three tradesmen that retire, there\u2019s just one trained worker waiting to take their position.\n\n\u201cThat generation was heavy into the skilled trades and they\u2019re all leaving the workforce, whereas my generation, when I was coming up through school, if you didn\u2019t plan on going to college then you were doing the wrong thing,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got two generations there that have left the workforce, and it\u2019s created this huge void we are now trying to fill.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s estimated the U.S. won\u2019t catch up with demand until 2050. By 2030, almost 80 million skilled tradesmen will have retired.\n\nApprenticeships are increasing as manufacturers and other companies associated with the trades partner with organizations like the Home Builders Institute to provide students with the skills, experience and job placement while addressing the industry\u2019s labor shortage.\n\nDickerson said part of the problem is the stigma surrounding manual labor and the emphasis today to earn a college degree.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get rid of that stigma of walking down the street and parents saying, \u2018Well look at that street sweeper, you don\u2019t want to be that person, or look at that plumber, you don\u2019t want to do that,'\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cThat stigma of getting your hands dirty isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s the old adage that dirty money is a clean money type situation \u2013 that you can make a good living wage, and not put yourself in a ton of debt.\u201d\n\nThe Home Builders Association of West Virginia works with tech schools in Marion and Monongalia counties. They also collaborate with the Wood County Vocational Technical Center in Parkersburg. A student chapter through the Mid Ohio Valley Home Builders Association is focused on introducing more young people into the profession.\n\n\u201cBecause those students are coming out \u2013 that\u2019s the next generation of our workforce \u2013 so the more we can be involved with them during the training program, the more we can ensure they are trained in the way we would like to hire somebody.\u201d\n\nHe said national efforts to fill jobs are better funded, but they try to do as much as they can on a local level to make the profession more attractive.\n\nViable Wage\n\n\u201cIn the future, your skilled trades are going to be some of your higher paying jobs because less and less people want to do it and that skill just isn\u2019t there like it was handed down generation to generation in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where getting rid of that stigma of getting your hands dirty is so important \u2013 to let these kids understand that you can go out, get your hands dirty and still provide for your family.\u201d\n\nThe average salary for entry-level sheet metal workers in West Virginia is $56,000. The hourly rate for the men and women who choose to become electricians is $27+ an hour. Carpenters can make up to $31 an hour and up to $64,000 annually.\n\nKent Pauley, state representative to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), is a seasoned tradesman and contractor. He said the good news is that today\u2019s skilled laborers are entering the profession at a time of increased job security and better work conditions.\n\n\u201cWhen I was coming up in the early \u201970s, it was very difficult to make a good living, I mean the pay scale,\u201d Pauley said. \u201cI tell the story if I was fired there\u2019d be five people behind me wanting that job. Well, that\u2019s not the case today. We have to pay better, do a better job of taking care of our employees, there\u2019s better insight for job safety than what it used to be.\u201d\n\nImmigration\n\nThe residential construction industry has historically relied on immigrants who make up 30 percent of all positions. This includes Hispanics and people from eastern Europe trained in skills like carpentry, painting, drywall, tile installation, brick masonry and others.\n\nBut with tougher immigration policies, this readily available workforce has shrunk.\n\n\u201cWith an immigration policy that restricts the flow of those that are willing to do jobs that sometimes are hard to fill, it causes just another headwind to provide the skilled labor in order to build the housing we need in this country,\u201d Brady said. \u201cWithout a good immigration policy, which provides legal free flowing skill to come into the country, we\u2019re going to continue to go in the wrong direction in providing that skilled labor.\u201d\n\nBrady said the industry needs to embrace change.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge opportunity to diversify this industry,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt\u2019s traditionally been, quite frankly, white male dominated. You add in the immigrant population, we need to market to women, to people of color and we need to diversify this industry in order to populate the skills that we need.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Home Builders Institute, 723,000 more jobs per year are needed to keep up with demand. That translates to the need for builders to bring on 30 times more new hires than the current pace.\n\nBrady stressed the answer lies in opening the skilled trades to a broader and younger workforce.\n\n\u201cThe reason it\u2019s so important to get young people into the industry is we\u2019ve lost a generation or two of giving people the opportunity to explore the industry,\u201d Brady said. \u201cA degree was a mandate out of the high school system. And that hasn\u2019t panned out to be all that productive.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story is part of the series, \u201cHelp Wanted: Understanding West Virginia\u2019s Labor Force.\u201d"
