        "content": "More music is coming to Kendall Square with approval Tuesday of a Ripple Caf\u00e9 location at 314 Main St., a new Massachusetts Institute of Technology building at the entrance to an MBTA red line headhouse.\n\nThe Cambridge square known for its life-sciences and tech innovation has taken strides toward adding homes, restaurants and other services, but beyond a nine-screen cinema it\u2019s not known for its entertainment. Ripple Cafe plans to bring in four or more performers one night a week, manager Gaelle Ducheine told Cambridge license commissioners. Permission was also granted for a DJ and background music. Poetry nights were also mentioned.\n\nThe square is still awaiting the reopening of Flat Top Johnny\u2019s, a pool hall that the commission approved in May for a 5,430-square-foot space in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology building at 238 Main St. It closed at a nearby location Aug. 14, 2020, ending a 27-year run because of Covid pandemic restrictions.\n\nA 24-hour pingpong space is also planned, said Beth O\u201dNeill Maloney, executive director of the Kendall Square Association.\n\nWith summertime concerts and the darts and live bluegrass music at Lily P\u2019s restaurant on Thursdays, O\u2019Neill defended Kendall against the idea that it\u2019s an entertainment desert. Still, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re very excited that Ripple Caf\u00e9 will add to the mix.\u201d\n\nThe operators of Ripple \u201cjust would like to bring some live music to that neighborhood, and in a good way \u2013 so not too loud,\u201d Ducheine said. Similar to Lily P\u2019s, the Ripple programming would be \u201cprobably once a week.\u201d\n\nThe owner, James Guerrier, is a Berklee College of Music grad, Ducheine noted, while she has an interest in interior design and refreshes the existing Ripple Caf\u00e9 \u2013 opened in Dorchester by Ashmont Station in 2019 \u2013 on a roughly quarterly basis.\n\n\u201cEssentially, it\u2019s just a third space that provides beautiful imagery, decor and a little bit of Caribbean components to the menu,\u201d said Ducheine, who, like Guerrier, is Haitian. She pointed to The Spicy Dejeneur, a breakfast sandwich of egg seasoned and cooked with sausage links, bell peppers and a hot relish that\u2019s served on potato bread to add a touch of sweetness.\n\nThe 2,874-square-foot site is \u201c99 percent done with construction\u201d and ready to be open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. all days, with occupancy for nearly 90 people indoors and another 47 on a patio. A request to add beer, wine and cordials may come later, Ducheine said.\n\nThe coming of Ripple Cafe is part of the work done during the remaking of land in the heart of Kendall known as the Volpe site after the resident federal transportation agency that decided to modernize and downsize, selling much of its land to MIT for development.\n\n\u201cWe engaged in an extensive community process during the planning of Volpe which led us to meet a number of local Bipoc retailers,\u201d said Anthony Galluccio, a lawyer who worked on the project and presented Ripple Caf\u00e9 to the commission, using a term for black, indigenous and people of color. \u201cThose relationships have been helpful in getting us acquainted with folks in the area that we think can bring an independent and a little more of an eclectic feel to the retail spaces here.\u201d\n\nAlso approved Tuesday by the commission was Chilacates, a Mexican street food eatery, at 561 Cambridge St., East Cambridge, where it would fill space once used by the East Side Bar & Grille. Chilacates has 10 locations around Boston. The 1,758-square-foot space with room for 30 was approved to be open 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday and Sunday."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ripple (XRP) While It's Below $0.60? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Legal battles, market expansion, and strategic moves are shaping the fate of this cryptocurrency. Explore the ups and downs of this digital investment opportunity.\n\nThe XRP (XRP 0.39%) cryptocurrency, commonly known as Ripple, scored an important legal win in mid-July. The digital-currency's price chart soared from $0.47 to $0.84 in a matter of hours.\n\nHowever, investor excitement has faded since then. Ripple trades at just $0.52 per token today. The trading volume has also faded dramatically in recent weeks.\n\nIs Ripple's fading chart a sign of long-term weakness or is it a good idea to pick up a few tokens on the cheap?\n\nRipple's recent backstory\n\nJuly's positive price correction was the result of a legal ruling in the lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in December 2020. U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres mulled over the evidence for months before issuing a final ruling, which was deemed a partial victory for Ripple Labs -- the organization that manages the Ripple blockchain network and the XRP token.\n\nCrucially, the verdict was Ripple-friendly enough that American crypto exchanges enabled buying and selling the token again. The SEC argued that Ripple should be treated as a security rather than a currency, which would place it under the agency's purview and make Ripple trades subject to the same requirements and limitations as stocks or bonds.\n\nBut Judge Torres disagreed with two of the SEC's three complaints. She allowed one motion to move forward to a full trial. In essence, Judge Torres ruled that Ripple should be treated as a security only in the hands of institutional investors and not when \"less sophisticated\" investors are involved.\n\nWhy Ripple's big jump didn't last\n\nSo the crypto briefly soared, then settled into a downhill slope. Many investors hoped for -- even expected -- a more clear-cut outcome.\n\nFurthermore, the ruling made it clear that this was not the end of the legal process. All three rulings are open for appeals, and it would not be surprising to see the wheels of the courtroom machinery grind all the way up to the Supreme Court over the next few years.\n\nIndeed, the SEC has already filed for an appeal on the grounds that the case is extremely important for the crypto investing sector and therefore deserves the deepest possible legal review. The agency says that the case hasn't been concluded in its current state. This filing accelerated the XRP token's price drop.\n\nWhat lies ahead for Ripple and XRP\n\nThe SEC lawsuit lingers on, and I don't think it's going away completely any time soon. The final, irrefutable, end-of-appeals outcome of this case should influence the government's long-term framework for crypto policies.\n\nJudge Torres' review appears to support separating the crypto sector into two camps -- security-like coins that should build value like a stock and currency-like coins used as tools of the trade. So far, Ripple falls in the second group, powering a digital-payment network.\n\nXRP's price chart should stay mellow until the matter is completely settled, one way or another.\n\nOn the upside, American crypto exchanges are once again comfortable with allowing people to trade this token without raising a legal firestorm. That improvement alone should allow the token to track closer to Ripple's actual business prospects over time.\n\nOn that note, the payment network seems poised to become a giant of international money transfers. The network has boosted its access to the South Korean market and launched a dollar-based stablecoin to serve as an official currency in the Republic of Palau. Those projects are less than six weeks old, announced after the SEC verdict.\n\nWhy Ripple's low price could be your cue to jump in\n\nI don't know if you noticed, but XRP is actually one of the largest players in the crypto market. With a $27.4 billion market cap, it has the fifth-largest market footprint today. Excluding fixed-value stablecoins, Ripple ranks as No. 3, behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nI'm not talking about some forgettable little altcoin here, but a current sector giant with strong management and potentially game-changing business plans. Don't forget that the SEC case is likely to affect how people, investors, companies, and governments all around the world will handle crypto assets in the long run. In other words, Ripple's future will affect the markets for Ethereum and Bitcoin, too.\n\nI can't promise that the end of the yellow brick appeals road will lead to a magical dreamland of hands-off regulation and free-flowing Ripple commerce, but the token seems poised to gain value in the long run, no matter what. Even a draconian turn of events further down the street would leave Ripple Labs open for business in more than 190 countries not named the U.S.\n\nSo I think it's a good idea to grab a few XRP tokens while they're cheap. After all the ups and downs in recent memory, Ripple is priced just below its three-year average."

        "title": "Assessing the Neymar, Barcelona, PSG ripple effect: Did that 2017 move work out for anyone? - ESPN",
        "content": "A little over six years ago, the soccer world seemed like it had just changed forever. Roughly two months after masterminding maybe the greatest comeback in the history of the Champions League for Barcelona against Paris Saint-Germain, Neymar was leaving Barcelona to go play for PSG.\n\nThe fee, of course, stood out -- how could it not? PSG paid \u20ac222 million to meet his buyout clause, which Barca seemingly had set at a random impossible-to-meet number during contract negotiations. After all, the previous transfer record was just -- \"just\" -- \u20ac105 million, paid by Manchester United for Paul Pogba the summer before.\n\nAfter years of gradually edging upward by \u20ac5 million or \u20ac10 million or \u20ac15 million, the world-transfer record suddenly doubled overnight. The largest previous jump was from \u20ac60 million to \u20ac77.5 million -- Real Madrid's moved first for Luis Figo and then for Zinedine Zidane. That's about a \u20ac17 million increase; PSG's move for Neymar increased the record by ... \u20ac117 million. The fact that there now existed a soccer club both capable and willing to do this meant that the fundamentals of the game had, well, fundamentally changed.\n\nIt wasn't quite clear exactly how they had changed in the moment, but the way things had worked in the past was that the best players in the world would all eventually make their way to Barcelona or Real Madrid. Sometimes there wasn't enough room for all of them, and obviously not every superstar wanted to live in Spain, but this was broadly the way of the soccer world.\n\nIn Neymar, Barcelona had acquired the next-best player in the world to go along with the current best player in the world, Lionel Messi. He arrived in Catalonia at 21, won the Champions League at 23 and figured to be there for the rest of his prime. And then, at 25, he was gone. Superstars just didn't do that to Barcelona or Real Madrid. We had entered a new world.\n\nOr had we? Six years on from maybe the most shocking individual player transaction of all time, with Neymar leaving Ligue 1 for the Saudi Pro League, it doesn't really seem like it's worked out for anyone involved.\n\nAfter agreeing to a deal with Saudi club Al Hilal, Neymar's relevance at the top level of global soccer is over. I'm sorry, but that's just how this works. You get to take the money; you don't get to act like you're still pursuing any kind of athletic excellence.\n\nAs someone who quite enjoys watching Neymar play soccer, I find it kind of sad. I've never seen anyone move like him. Soccer is supposed to look hard: You're dribbling a ball with your feet, and there are only so many body positions you can get into that allow you to control it with any sort of confidence. You perfect the fundamentals as a kid, and then you build off that base. At least, for most people. For Neymar, it didn't matter that the ball was round and your foot was a weird, bony misshapen thing with toes and your knees bent only forward and backward and your hips could open by 90 degrees.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\nIn terms of the pure skill of controlling a soccer ball through a variety of circumstances and move it toward the opposition goal, Neymar is the best there ever was.\n\nThat goal, though, sort of symbolizes his career. It was an incredible run and an incredible finish; it's all him, as he's the only one who can do that. With just a few minutes left in extra time of a World Cup quarterfinal, it should have gone down as one of the best goals in the history of the tournament. It should have set up an epic semifinal with Messi and Brazil's eternal rivals Argentina. It should have; instead, Croatia soon equalized on a lucky deflection with barely any time left and then won on penalties.\n\nThat goal happened; we all saw it, feeling its importance as it happened. That was real -- and then everything that happened since made it feel fake. Not unlike the path Neymar walked over his 10 years in Europe.\n\nThere's no use in contextualizing what happened at Barcelona; he was brilliant, full stop. The 2014-15 team might be the best club side of all time, and the 2015-16 team was right up there, too. In his three years as a full-time starter with the club, he averaged 20 goals and 11 assists per LaLiga season. And he played a little over 80% of the available league minutes.\n\nWhenever the club needed him, he was there -- over and over and over again. During the last two seasons, in particular, he picked up the slack whenever Messi was injured or had a rare off day.\n\nThat comeback happened in 2017, he was 25, and it might have been his last high-level triumph in Europe. When you move to PSG, you're accepting that you're only going to get a couple of chances to play games that really matter. Your team have so much more money than the rest of the league that they're going to win Ligue 1 whether or not you're there. But Neymar pushed that idea about as far as he could. While in Paris, he appeared in a comical 48% of the league minutes. PSG doubled the transfer record for a player who wasn't even out there half of the time.\n\nOf course, they didn't really care about that. But over his final three seasons at Barca, Neymar played in 89% of the possible Champions League minutes. Despite easing off the gas pedal in Ligue 1, his European participation for PSG also declined to 71% of available CL minutes.\n\nSo we're just left with this kind of incredible, unsatisfying half-formed career. On the one hand, Neymar was the most-hyped prospect since Messi, he moved to Barcelona at 21, almost immediately lit the league on fire, exceeded all of the near-impossible expectations and won every possible trophy in sight.\n\nFrom a pure per-minute production standpoint, he's the closest thing we've seen to the greatest to ever do it:\n\n(Image courtesy of FBcharts.com/Opta)\n\nOn the other hand, well, Neymar might be better at the pure act of playing soccer -- manipulating the ball with anything other than your hands than anyone else has been. But for the entire second half of his 20s, we rarely got to see him play.\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nPSG acquired Neymar to help them win the Champions League. With him at the club, they reached one final -- albeit in the COVID-abbreviated, single-elimination season -- and one semifinal, but otherwise never made it past the round of 16. They'd reached the quarterfinals in all four seasons before Neymar arrived.\n\nThat's not to say the team's failure is Neymar's fault. Rather, when your only goal is to win an incredibly random knockout soccer competition, perhaps it's not wise to invest that much money in a single player -- even when you have comparatively unlimited funds compared to your competitors. Although, had they won the final against Bayern Munich in 2020, then maybe this whole section would be moot. Had a couple of bounces gone differently, they would've won that game, too:\n\nHowever, more broadly, PSG seemed poised to take over European soccer in the summer of 2017. Don't forget they also signed Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 for what would've been a pre-Neymar world-record fee that offseason, too. They had their Jord\u00e1n-brand jerseys. They were in freaking Paris, after all.\n\nWas this going to become the new team that all the young superstars wanted to go to? Could they continue to poach away ready-made excellence from the Barcelonas and the Real Madrids of the world?\n\nNot really, no.\n\nAlthough club chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi has steadily accrued more power within the bureaucracy of the European game and although they were also able to employ Lionel Messi while he finally won that elusive World Cup with Argentina, PSG's standing within the sport might be lower than it was before they brought in Neymar. They're on their fifth coach in the previous six years, and there's some kind of pathetic, massive blowup every time they get eliminated from the Champions League. It's always someone else's fault.\n\nAnd while it seems like Mbappe, who has only a year left on his contract, is going to stay with the club, I can't imagine the whole \"sign a new contract or we bench you\" thing is going to endear them to the next generation of stars, either.\n\nIn 2023-24, it does seem like they're finally trying to build something resembling a real team for the first time -- surrounding Mbappe with a bunch of complementary pieces who can cover up all the gaps created by having a player who doesn't do much defending and who needs players to pass him the ball. But they're still a ways away from achieving the one thing they want to achieve.\n\nAs of now, five other teams (Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Arsenal, and Barcelona) have better odds to win this season's Champions League. They're closer to Manchester United in seventh than they are to Manchester City in first.\n\nBarcelona\n\nIn the two years after Neymar left, Barcelona won consecutive league titles, but paired that with two massive Champions League second-leg collapses -- first against Roma and then against Liverpool. They didn't win another league title until last year. Oh, and they lost Messi and have since progressively sold off large chunks of their future revenues in order to fund transfer purchases to improve the current squad in the short term.\n\nFor now, at least, Barcelona are no longer the go-to destination for the best young stars in the sport. That's either Real Madrid or Manchester City -- one club are their hated rivals, the other are now being run by all of the people who helped build the great Barcelona sides of the late aughts and early 2010s.\n\nWhen they lost Neymar, Barcelona were still at the top of European soccer right along with Madrid, and maybe Bayern Munich and Juventus. They weren't expecting to lose Neymar, but suddenly they had $200 million-plus to acquire pretty much anyone they wanted. Messi, Suarez and most of the 2014-15 core were still there. Given that no player had ever gone for even half as much money as Neymar did, it stood to reason that the income could be reinvested in a group of players who could provide more value to the club collectively than Neymar could on his own.\n\nThey kind of tried to do that, but really they just tried to acquire two Neymars, 20-year-old Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 from Borussia Dortmund (\u20ac105 million) and 25-year-old Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool (\u20ac145m). Among similar-to-Neymar players -- guys who could score and create goals while also moving the ball up the field -- these were probably the two best 25-and-under options available. Rather than spreading the risk around, Barca went all-in on two players who could max out Messi's 30s and carry the torch after he left the club.\n\nExcept, they swung and missed on both.\n\nA ball-dominant midfielder/attacker, Coutinho proved to be too similar to Messi, either crowding out the best player of all time or not providing the kind of off-ball movement necessary to take advantage of Messi's skills. He played only 32% of the minutes while with the club and was sent out on loan after just his first full season in Spain.\n\nThe speedy Dembele, meanwhile, was the perfect player to pair with Messi and add to an aging, increasingly unathletic Barca side -- in theory. It's just that he, too, never played. In his six seasons with the club, he featured in just 37% of all the domestic minutes. Rather than a performance issue, like Coutinho, Dembele's main problem is that he was simply never healthy, though the outcome was essentially the same.\n\nIn reality, the only team that really seemed to materially benefit from the Neymar transfer -- and have their trajectory changed in a clear and meaningful way -- were Liverpool.\n\nAfter letting Coutinho go to Barcelona in the middle of the 2017-18 season, they first acquired center-back Virgil van Dijk from Southampton and promptly made a run all the way to the Champions League final. After losing to Real Madrid, 3-1, they acquired defensive midfielder Fabinho from Monaco and keeper Alisson from Roma, both moves no doubt aided by the influx of cash from the Coutinho transfer. With all three of those players starting, Liverpool beat Barcelona in the semifinals of the following season's Champions League before taking down Tottenham in the final.\n\nThat trio formed the spine of a team that would go on to win every trophy possible over the following four seasons. Who knows if that still happens if Coutinho stays at Anfield?\n\nNeymar, meanwhile, made a ton of money in a career that isn't going to last for long, so he didn't really \"lose,\" either. But I think he'd sit higher in the public estimation had he remained at Barcelona because I think Barcelona would have been better off, too, had he stayed. The mismanagement of the club had already begun before he left, but given how good Neymar was in Spain -- and how not-present Coutinho and Dembele ended up being -- he likely would have raised the team's performance to a higher level than what we saw in the seasons following his departure.\n\nWith PSG, I'm not so sure that they wouldn't have just signed another Neymar-esque player had they failed to sign Neymar back in 2017. Chase the big name, regardless of the fit. Their overall track record doesn't suggest that they would've found someone better, and the team really were quite good at times with Neymar and Mbappe together in the Champions League. The bigger issue was with how they built the team around those two.\n\nBut maybe, if Neymar doesn't come, the club quickly realize that Mbappe might be an even bigger star and better player -- and then they focus on building the team around his strengths and weaknesses. I doubt it, but we can't know for sure.\n\nInstead, though, we're left with a process that might as well have never happened. Neither Barcelona nor PSG won another Champions League, and they reached only one final, combined. At just 31, Neymar is already off to wind down his career in Saudi Arabia. Coutinho is coming off the bench for Neymar's first PSG manager, Unai Emery, now at Aston Villa in the Premier League.\n\nAnd perhaps most fittingly of all, Dembele, the player whom Barcelona first signed to replace Neymar, now plays for PSG."

Thank you for your interest.\n\nEnforcement Actions\n\nUnited States\n\nRipple Secures Landmark Win Against SEC, SEC Seeks To Appeal\n\nOn July 13, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that the SEC could not establish as a matter of law that a crypto token was a security in and of itself, delivering a landmark legal victory for the cryptocurrency industry. The ruling provided a win for a cryptocurrency company in a case brought by the SEC, while also giving the SEC a partial victory. The judge determined that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales on public exchanges were not offers of securities, but sales to sophisticated investors amounted to unregistered sales of securities. The case has significant implications for the broader crypto industry and has triggered calls for Congress to provide clear rules and legislation for digital assets. Following the ruling, both Coinbase and Kraken, large U.S. crypto exchanges, announced they will allow trading of XRP on their platforms again. On August 9, the SEC stated in a letter to the court that it plans to seek an interlocutory appeal, which is a generally disfavored procedural step that would require Judge Torres\u2019s approval. On August 17, Judge Torres permitted the SEC to file a motion to file an interlocutory appeal by the following day. Ripple will have until September 1 to file its response to the motion, and the SEC will have until September 8 to file a reply. Only if Judge Torres grants the motion will the SEC then be allowed to seek permission for an interlocutory appeal also from the Second Circuit.

Terraform and Do Kwon argued that the above Ripple decision invalidated the SEC\u2019s case against them. Significantly, Judge Rakoff agreed with Judge Torres\u2019 Ripple ruling that the SEC could not establish as a matter of law that a crypto token was a security in and of itself. However, Judge Rakoff rejected the Ripple opinion\u2019s distinction between institutional versus retail purchasers for whether a token was offered as a security.

Kaplan of the Manhattan Federal District Court revoked his bail, concluding that Bankman-Fried\u2019s communications with the media and an attempt to contact a former FTX employee constituted attempts \u201cto tamper with witnesses at least twice\u201d in the lead-up to his trial, which is scheduled to start on October 2. The presiding judge had imposed a temporary gag order in the case while considering prosecutors\u2019 request to jail Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried had been under house arrest at his parents\u2019 home since December, released on a $250 million bond. The U.S. government sought modifications to Bankman-Fried\u2019s bail agreement after he showed a reporter private writings of Caroline Ellison, the former head of the crypto hedge fund he founded and his former girlfriend, who is a key witness for the prosecution. Bankman-Fried also had phone calls with journalists and was in contact with an author who is writing a book about his rise and fall that is set for publication the week before the trial begins.Meanwhile, U.S. prosecutors announced they intend to file a superseding indictment that will incorporate Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged campaign finance charge into existing charges, reversing a reported late-July decision to drop the campaign contribution charge from their fraud case against Bankman-Fried, after he argued it was not part of his extradition agreement. Bankman-Fried also faces fraud and conspiracy charges that could lead to decades in prison if convicted.

The SEC alleges that Coinbase violated securities laws by listing on its platform digital assets that the SEC considers securities. At the conference, Judge Faila expressed \u201cskepticism\u201d with the SEC\u2019s position, that the Court \u201cwould have thought the [SEC] was doing diligence\u201d when it approved Coinbase\u2019s Form S-1 to commence trading, and that the SEC failed to warn Coinbase that \u201cmaybe some day there could be a problem\u201d and sued two years later. The Court also voiced concerns over the breadth of the SEC\u2019s definition of securities, its ability to communicate this definition to the public, and the vagueness of the Howey test, the SEC\u2019s criteria for whether a digital asset qualifies as a security. On August 4, Coinbase filed its motion for judgment on the pleadings, maintaining that the SEC\u2019s claims fall outside the agency\u2019s Congressionally delegated authority because the platform does not trade securities. The motion contends that the SEC\u2019s claims must be dismissed because (i) the SEC fails to allege a contractual undertaking beyond the point of sale, (ii) the alleged transactions lack expectation in income, profits, or assets of a business, (iii) the major questions doctrine prohibits the SEC\u2019s interpretation of \u201cinvestment contract,\u201d (iv) the SEC fails to allege Coinbase acts as a \u201cbroker\u201d by making Wallet software available, and (v) Coinbase\u2019s alleged staking services do not involve relinquishment of property creating risk of loss or profits generated by managerial efforts. The case is closely watched for its potential impact on cryptocurrency trading and exchange listings. On August 11, a group of six securities law scholars filed an amicus brief in support of Coinbase. The law professors argue that the tokens traded on Coinbase are not \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d under the settled meaning of the term in that they lack a contractual undertaking and an expectation in income, profits, or assets of a business, and, therefore, are not securities. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and the Blockchain Association, a pro-crypto lobbying group, also filed amicus briefs in support of Coinbase\u2019s motion, arguing in part that Congress has not granted the SEC authority to regulate crypto assets.

The SEC also accused Heart and PulseChain of fraud by misappropriating at least $12 million of proceeds from the offerings to buy luxury items, including sports cars and a 555-carat black diamond. Heart allegedly promoted Hex as a high-yield \u201cblockchain certificate of deposit,\u201d and claimed returns as high as 38% for a \u201cstaking\u201d feature for Hex tokens, misleading investors with promises of wealth. The SEC\u2019s complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, penalties, and other equitable relief.

The CFTC, FTC, and SEC simultaneously filed civil suits alleging similar claims against Mashinsky. The FTC\u2019s complaint also names Celsius officers Shlomi Daniel Leon and Hanoch \u201cNuke\u201d Goldstein. Mashinsky is accused of having schemed to defraud customers about the security of the Celsius platform, and made false or misleading statements about profits and Mashinsky\u2019s purchases and sales of Celsius\u2019s token to inflate the token\u2019s value and to attract customer deposits of digital assets to the platform. Mashinsky is further accused of misappropriating deposits, unregistered offers and sales of securities, using false statements to obtain customer information of a financial institution, consumer harm, acting as an unregistered commodity pool operator (CPO) and associated person (AP) of a CPO, and failing to make commodity pool disclosures. Mashinsky faces up to 115 years in prison if found guilty on all criminal counts. Mashinsky pleaded not guilty and was released from custody on a $40 million bond.

After withdrawing the fees as cryptocurrency, Ahmed communicated with the crypto exchange, offering to return most of the stolen funds on the condition that he avoid referral to law enforcement. Ahmed then laundered the proceeds of the exploit through various transactions, including swapping tokens, bridging blockchains, exchanging into Monero for anonymity, and using overseas cryptocurrency exchanges. Ahmed subsequently conducted online searches related to the exploit, his criminal liability, fleeing the U.S., and avoiding extradition. Ahmed, aged 34, pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and money laundering, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Ahmed was released on bond and reportedly will be permitted to live at his Manhattan apartment pending trial.

Bittrex Inc.\u2019s foreign affiliate, Bittrex Global GmbH, also agreed to settle charges that it failed to register as a national securities exchange. The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in April 2023, also alleged that Bittrex provided services to U.S. investors with crypto assets that were considered securities and that Shihara, the company\u2019s former CEO, directed issuers to remove from public channels certain statements that would alert regulators to investigate whether the crypto asset was offered and sold as a security. As part of the settlement, Bittrex and Shihara neither admit nor deny the allegations and will pay $24 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, pending court approval.

The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Judge Robert Pitman, found that Tornado Cash qualified as an association, composed of its founders, its developers, and its DAO, with the common purpose of developing, promoting, and governing Tornado Cash, and thus could be designated under OFAC regulations, despite arguments that Tornado Cash was autonomous software. The court then held that it would defer to OFAC\u2019s determination that smart contracts constitute property. Specifically, the court found whereas contracts are property under the regulations, smart contracts are a \u201ccode-enabled species of unilateral contracts,\u201d \u201clike a vending machine.\u201d Judge Pitman further found that Tornado Cash had a beneficial interest in the smart contracts, stemming from an expectation that they would generate revenue in the form of tokens. The court additionally rejected plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment arguments, holding (among other things) that the Amendment does not protect a right to make political donations through any bank or service of their choosing. Lastly, the court held the plaintiffs\u2019 Fifth Amendment Takings Claim was waived as the plaintiffs failed to pursue it against the government\u2019s motion. The plaintiffs may appeal.

Worldcoin requires that users provide an iris scan in exchange for a digital World ID and in certain countries pays a user 25 tokens for a scan. Operators of Worldcoin\u2019s iris-scanning Orbs receive tokens as incentives as well. WLD tokens currently trade for around $2. Worldcoin reportedly has collected over 2.2 million individuals\u2019 iris scans to date. CNIL\u2019s investigations support the ongoing and previously reported work on the project of Bavarian privacy regulators, who bear primary responsibility under EU law. The project has reiterated its compliance with EU\u2019s law on biometric data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Worldcoin also faces concerns from the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office regarding the sufficiency and ability to withdraw consent consistent with data processing rights. On August 2, the Kenyan minister of internal security announced a temporary ban on Worldcoin from operating in the country until authorities had the opportunity to assess any risk to residents. On August 7, Kenyan police reportedly raided a Worldcoin warehouse in Nairobi and seized machines believed to store Worldcoin data. The Kenyan Data Commissioner alleged that Worldcoin\u2019s parent company, Tools for Humanity, had misrepresented its intentions when registering and the Kenyan Interior Cabinet Secretary stated that Worldcoin was not a registered legal entity.

The Program will primarily focus on four types of activities: (1) complex, technology-driven partnerships with non-bank entities to offer banking services to end customers, including through application programming interfaces (APIs) with automated bank infrastructure access; (2) crypto-asset-related activities, including custodial services, crypto-collateralized lending, facilitation of crypto trading, and issuance or distribution stablecoins/dollar tokens; (3) projects utilizing distributed ledger technology (DLT) with \u201cpotential for significant impact on the financial system,\u201d which the supervision and regulation letter to Federal Reserve officers recognizes as including dollar token issuance, as well as tokenization of securities and other assets; and (4) banking organizations concentrating in offering traditional banking services like deposits, payments, and lending to crypto-asset-related entities and fintechs. The Program is designed to work in partnership with existing Federal Reserve supervisory teams to monitor and examine novel activities, and banks engaged in such novel activities will not be moved to a separate supervisory portfolio. The Federal Reserve will notify institutions in writing whose novel activities will be subject to examination through the Program.

Assessment by Federal Reserve staff will focus on various factors, including operational, cybersecurity, liquidity, illicit finance, and consumer compliance risks tied to dollar tokens, as well as compliance with applicable laws.

Reflecting on a renewed focus on accounting firms following recent developments and insolvency in the industry, as well as a recent trend involving crypto platforms and others engaging accounting firms to perform reviews and marketing these as \u201caudits\u201d to investors, Munter cautioned that accounting firms could face legal liability under antifraud laws for statements made by their clients, if the clients mislead about the extent of a financial review or the \u201cscope of work\u201d done by the accounting firm. As part of their public responsibilities, the SEC Chief Accountant insisted, accounting firms must ensure that accountants\u2019 names or services are not used to convey a false sense of legitimacy or to mislead investors. Thus, where an accounting firm learns that a client has made misleading statements to the public about the nature of its non-audit work, the Office of the Chief Accountant staff view that best practice is for the firm to consider making a noisy withdrawal to disassociate from the client. SEC Statement\n\nGensler Raises Concerns About Fraud And Manipulation For Bitcoin ETFs\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler expressed skepticism about the crypto marketplace when asked about pending applications for spot bitcoin ETF applications in a televised interview on July 27. Though Gensler did not make a direct statement regarding the recent wave of filings spurred by BlackRock in the interview, he did raise concerns about general fraud and potential manipulation in the crypto industry. \u201cThe platforms themselves, where trading is occurring of various crypto tokens, though some of it comes under the securities laws, currently they\u2019re not necessarily compliant with those time-tested protections against fraud and manipulation,\u201d Gensler said.

The amended filings include ETFs from Invesco, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, and the joint fund ARK Invest and 21Shares. Cboe stated that it \u201creached an agreement on terms\u201d with Coinbase for the SSAs. Coinbase\u2019s shares surged as much as 11% on June 11 following the announcement. Cboe\u2019s filings follow on the heels of Nasdaq\u2019s refiling for BlackRock\u2019s ETF in July, which also listed Coinbase as a surveillance sharing partner. The SSAs are intended to meet the SEC\u2019s standards for preventing fraud and protecting investors, as outlined by the regulator earlier this year. If approved, the filings would mark the first spot bitcoin ETFs. The Block; CoinTelegraph\n\nTwo Major Crypto VC Funds Announce New Fundraisings, Buck \u201cCrypto Winter\u201d\n\nPolychain Capital, one of the most prominent venture capital firms in the crypto space, has raised around $200 million in the \u201cfirst close\u201d of its fourth crypto venture capital fund. The firm further plans to raise around $400 million total for this fund. Polychain has around $2.6 billion in assets under management. Coinfund, a New York-based crypto venture capital firm, also announced that it raised $158 million in its latest funding round and is focusing on crypto infrastructure projects that enable greater decentralization, a trend that has emerged after the implosion of FTX last year. Both successful raises come in the midst of an extended crypto winter that has seen a broad retreat from crypto-related investments following a series of failures throughout 2022, further complicated by higher interest rates that have increased the cost of borrowing. But Alex Felix, Coinfund\u2019s co-founder and chief investment officer, has pointed out that this slower-paced environment raises the quality of entrepreneurs competing for more limited funds.

The attacks also targeted lending protocol Alchemix, yield platform Pendle, synthetic asset tool Metronome, and decentralized NFT protocol JPEG. Spooked traders withdrew roughly $1.5 billion worth of digital assets after hackers stole around $62 million from Curve. The price of the Curve DAO (CRV) declined 20.91% on the day of the hack, and continued to decline the next day to a seven-month low. By the morning of August 1, the market valuation of CRV had plummeted 46%. This drop in turn triggered wider market fear as Curve Finance founder, Michael Egorov, had loans worth roughly $100 million secured against CRV, collateral that was at risk of liquidation if the price of CRV dipped below a certain threshold. Several actions were taken to mitigate any risk of a liquidation crisis for Curve\u2014and to avoid any systemic risk for DeFi more broadly. On August 1, Egorov sold 39.25 million CRV tokens for stablecoins to a number of notable decentralized finance investors, including Justin Sun, the founder of Tron blockchain, for a total of $15.8 million. Egorov also made partial repayment on certain of his loans, reducing liquidation risk. Further, the DAO that governs one of the lending platforms that Egorov had borrowed from, Abracadabra, approved an emergency measure to change how it tracks those tokens\u2019 prices to prevent inadvertent selling of CRV tokens. As of August 11, Curve Finance had recovered 70% of funds worth about $50 million lost in the hacking incident.

The stablecoin will be an Ethereum-based token fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents, and will be redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars. It will enable eligible U.S. PayPal customers to transfer funds, send person-to-person payments, fund purchases, and convert cryptocurrencies within the PayPal ecosystem. The stablecoin\u2019s issuance is managed by Paxos Trust Company and is designed to bridge the gap between fiat and digital currencies, while promoting transparency through public monthly reserve reports and third-party attestations of value.

It will also feature 34 tokens available for trading, including Binance Smart Chain\u2019s BNB, which will be available in Japan for the first time. CoinDesk\n\nPro-Bitcoin Argentine Presidential Candidate, Javier Milei, Wins Presidential Primary\n\nJavier Milei, a libertarian candidate, unexpectedly won Argentina\u2019s open presidential primary election with over 30% of the vote, positioning him as a front-runner for the fall general election. Milei has called for abolition of Argentina\u2019s central bank as a \u201cscam\u201d and spoken favorably of Bitcoin, remarking that it \u201crepresents the return of money to its original creator, the private sector.\u201d Milei\u2019s party, La Libertad Avanza, also has tweeted positively of El Salvador\u2019s use of Bitcoin as legal tender. Milei, however, advocates for dollarization of the Argentine economy as triple-digit inflation afflicts the nation. The general election is set for October, with a potential runoff in November.
