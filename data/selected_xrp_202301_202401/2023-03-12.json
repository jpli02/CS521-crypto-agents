        "content": "Ripple is the latest crypto company to comment on its connections to Silicon Valley Bank, which failed Friday after a run on deposits forced regulators to put the FDIC in control of its remaining assets. Amid fear that large depositors may not be made whole, federal regulators are said to be considering measures that would seek to prevent the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history from kicking off a broader crisis."

        "content": "Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s Failure Could Ripple Through the Economy and Impact Austin Tech Startups\n\nIsabella Casillas Guzman, the U.S. Small Business Administrator, and Mark Cuban, Billionaire Tech Entrepreneur at ZenBusiness SXSW panel Sunday morning\n\nThe Silicon Valley Bank failure can have downstream consequences depending on how the government responds to it, said Mark Cuban, billionaire tech entrepreneur.\n\n\u201cThe rich people got wiped out already,\u201d Cuban said at a South by Southwest panel discussion Sunday morning. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is the depositor. If they can\u2019t get their money out come Monday, you ain\u2019t getting paid. If you don\u2019t get paid, others don\u2019t get paid.\u201d\n\nSVB, which had $209 billion in total assets and $175.4 billion in total deposits at the end of 2022, failed on Friday. SVB is where a large share of VC firms and VC-backed startups all across the country held deposits, according to the National Venture Capital Association. It\u2019s the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history behind Washington Mutual in 2008.\n\nThe investors of SVB are out of money, Cuban said. All those people who had deposits over the FDIC insured $250,000, that\u2019s tens of thousands of companies that need access to their money for inventory, payroll, and accounts payable, Cuban said. If they don\u2019t get access to their funds, it could have substantial ripple effects throughout the economy, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Feds have to come in and say we\u2019ve got you,\u201d Cuban said. The bank got hit with a liquidity crunch, he said. \u201cThe federal government has to say all deposits will be made whole. I know that\u2019s scary, but that\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nIsabella Casillas Guzman, the U.S. Small Business Administrator, also participated in the SXSW panel discussion and said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen was working closely with bank regulators on the collapse. She said that many of SVB\u2019s depositors are small businesses and are critical to the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cThis weekend is critical,\u201d Guzman said. Regulators are working to determine the right actions to ensure the U.S. economy remains strong.\n\nOn Sunday morning\u2019s Face the Nation TV show, Secretary Yellen said SVB\u2019s failure stemmed from a rise in interest rates. And that many of the depositors were small businesses and that the regulators were working on a solution for them, she said. But the Federal government didn\u2019t plan to bail out the investors and owners of the bank.\n\n\u201cThe problems of this bank, from reporting about its situation, suggest that because we\u2019re in a higher interest rate environment, assets that it holds, many of which are Treasury assets, or mortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed by the government lose market value, and the problems of the tech sector aren\u2019t at the heart of the problems of this bank,\u201d Yellen said on Face the Nation, according to a show transcript.\n\nSVB\u2019s bank failure is the buzz around SXSW, the annual technology conference held in Austin every Spring.\n\nThe bank backed a lot of startups locally, said Ross Buhrdorf, CEO of Austin-based ZenBusiness.\n\n\u201cWe ran our business out of it,\u201d Buhrdorf said. He spoke to Silicon Hills News Sunday morning after an SXSW panel his company moderated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re scrambling to figure out how to run day to day,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a bunch of us are.\u201d\n\nBuhrdorf, founding Chief Technology Officer of HomeAway, which sold to Expedia and is now known as VRBO, is also an active angel investor in Austin and has backed dozens of companies. All of them used SVB, he said.\n\nZenBusiness is one of Austin\u2019s home-grown Unicorn companies. Founded in 2017, ZenBusiness runs an online platform to help small businesses incorporate and stay compliant with regulators. It raised a $200 million Series C round in late 2021, valuing the company at $1.7 billion.\n\nZenBusiness is not exposed financially, Buhrdorf said. He said it diversified its bank deposits in several banks before the bank failure. But ZenBusiness\u2019 payroll is run out of there, he said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just change that and the next day go to another bank,\u201d he said."
