        "content": "XRP News: Cardano Founder, Charles Hoskinson who earlier criticized XRP and its community online, made a revelation about working with Ripple in the past. However, he tried to make a truce with the XRP community when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) listed Cardano as a \u201cSecurity\u201d being offered by non-compliant crypto exchanges.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Was Marked For Death, Says Bitcoin Maxi; XRP Lawyer, Ripple CTO Replies\n\nadvertisement\n\nCardano Founder, Vitalik And Ripple\n\nCharles Hoskinson in a tweet questioned why people are claiming that he worked as an intern at Ripple. Cardano founder clarified that he never worked for the blockchain firm in any capacity in the past. However, he did mention Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin in the comment. He highlighted that people are confusing him with the ETH founder.\n\nHowever, reports suggest that Vitalik Buterin had confessed that he tried to be an intern at Ripple back in 2013. He also wrote an article praising Ripple in the same year. ETH founder stated that Ripple accomplished an impressive feat as now they have a way of sending, receiving and holding any currency in a decentralized way.

        "content": "As the legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unfolds, experts continue to speculate on the possible outcomes for both parties involved.\n\nIn this line, renowned Bitcoin (BTC) expert and outspoken critic Max Keiser has suggested that the SEC would ultimately succeed in bringing down XRP while criticizing Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, referring to his operation as a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d, he said in a tweet on June 23.\n\nKeiser emphasized that he believes it is only a matter of time before the regulatory authority takes action against XRP while acknowledging that the SEC\u2019s actions may be considered by some as \u201coverreaching,\u201d but nevertheless predicting significant consequences for most cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin expert further proposed that the financial world, particularly on Wall Street, lacks a comprehensive rule of law that tends to favor individuals with wealth and influence.\n\n\u201cOf course, the SEC is \u2018overreaching,\u2019 but that won\u2019t stop them from killing off XRP and every other shitcoin. (Except BTC, of course. It\u2019s untouchable). Because there is virtually no rule of law whatsoever in Wall St/finance for those with $ and clout, Brad Garlinghouse has been spending a lot to keep his Ponzi scheme going, but he can\u2019t outspend the Feds & Jamie Dimon. It\u2019s just a matter of when, not if, when XRP gets cut down,\u201d he said.\n\nQuestions over SEC\u2019s conduct\n\nKeiser expressed his sentiment in response to a tweet by pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton on June 22. Deaton had criticized Bitcoin maximalists for celebrating what he referred to as the SEC\u2019s excessive regulatory practices in the cryptocurrency space.\n\n\u201cWhat is inconsistent is that so many BTC Maxis fancy themselves Libertarians and then applaud or celebrate the massive and gross overreach by the SEC,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is worth noting that Keiser has previously been critical of Ripple, suggesting that the company stands no chance against the regulator. In a report by Finbold, Keiser highlighted that the blockchain firm cannot triumph over the SEC, stating that XRP is essentially \u201cmarked for death.\u201d\n\nAs I keep telling you guys, the SEC swept away the independent \u2018crypto\u2019 exchanges & players, to make room for BlackRock, Wisdom Tree, Fidelity, etc. to get into #Bitcoin\n\n\n\nXRP ain\u2019t gonna win their case. This was never about the law. XRP was marked for death and Gary\u2019s job is to\u2026 \u2014 Max Keiser, sr. bitcoin advisor pres. Bukele \ud83c\udf0b\ud83e\udde2 (@maxkeiser) June 21, 2023\n\nImpact of SEC lawsuit\n\nThe outcome of the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple Labs and its potential consequences for the future of XRP remains uncertain. The case holds significant importance for investors and enthusiasts who closely monitor the ongoing legal proceedings, as they can potentially shape the regulatory environment for digital assets.\n\nAt the moment, the crypto community eagerly awaits the announcement of the date for the summary judgment following the conclusion of the hearing.\n\nAdding to the anticipation, a significant development unfolded when the controversial Hinman documents were unsealed, offering insights into the regulator\u2019s initial perspective on the classification of digital assets."

        "title": "Ripple project wins New European Bauhaus Prize for sustainability and inclusiveness | UCD Research - NovaUCD",
        "content": "The Ripple community project led by UCD Centre for Irish Towns has been awarded a New European Bauhaus Prize in the \u201cconnecting with nature\u201d category. Announced at an Awards Ceremony in Brussels last night, this is the first ever Irish entry to win the prize.\n\nThe New European Bauhaus (NEB) Prizes recognise projects that demonstrate how sustainable solutions promoted by the European Green Deal can be inclusive and beautiful, and bring high-quality experiences to people's everyday lives.\n\nOut of 1400 applicants from across the EU and the Western Balkans, 15 winners will receive a monetary prize of up to \u20ac30,000 and a communication package to help them further develop and promote their projects and concepts.\n\nElisa Ferreira, EU Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms said: \u201cThese Prizes recognise bottom-up initiatives embodying the NEB values: beauty, sustainability, inclusivity. Transforming and improving people\u2019s lives, as well as empowering local communities are key principles of Cohesion policy. This is why we have been supporting the NEB community from the very beginning. The NEB and Cohesion association is turning bright ideas into inspiring projects.\u201d\n\nThe Project: Ripple\n\nPublic green spaces, common in housing estates throughout Ireland, represent a significant untapped resource for climate action, through their potential transformation as water resilient, productive and socially cohesive public space.\n\nRipple trialled a collaborative place-based approach to climate resilient green space in towns. Funded under the Government of Ireland \u2018Creative Ireland\u2019 programme, with support from Mayo County Council, the project was coordinated between Ballina Green Towns, UCD Centre for Irish Towns, local artist Rionach N\u00ed N\u00e9ill, and the community of Greenhills Estate, Ballina.\n\nA core tenet of climate resilience is to \u201cleave no person or place behind\u201d. The UCD Centre for Irish Towns team (Orla Murphy, Dr Philip Crowe and Rebecca O'Malley, UCD School of Architecture, Planning and Environmental Policy, and Dr Sara Cotterill, UCD School of Civil Engineering) was keen to trial this approach with a community that had faced socio-economic challenges to see if a model of respectful support, listening and engagement could generate a positive ripple-effect. Working together, they built the \u2018Paradise Garden\u2019, a climate-friendly intergenerational amenity space and wildlife haven, where rainwater is slowed through a series of rills, wells and natural attenuation on its way to the river.\n\nThe process involved Storymapping, Co-Design, Making and Evaluation stages. The team gathered the experiences and perspectives of residents about water and neighbourhood green spaces. 16 prospective ideas were co-designed and voted upon. The preferred idea \u2013 the Paradise Garden, features a tree nursery for local oaks, heritage fruit trees, vegetable beds, pollinator friendly planting, and nature based play. Rainwater is slowed through a series of rills, wells and natural attenuation features on its way to the river.\n\nThe Ripple project has inspired a broad section of the community and has developed a set of tools that can be scaled up and out for application in other communities in Ireland and beyond.

        "title": "Ripple CTO Explains How Bitso Sends Billions in XRP Without Operating in US - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently clarified how crypto exchange Bitso facilitates billions in XRP remittance without operating in the U.S.\n\nIn a recent conversation, David Schwartz, the CTO of Ripple, clarified how the Mexican-based exchange Bitso facilitates the transfer of billions in XRP remittances between Mexico and the United States without a physical presence in the U.S.\n\nBitso Facilitates $3B+ in Remittances\n\nTiffany Hayden, a well-known XRP community influencer and former Community Manager at Edge, raised the question, sparking an insightful discussion with David Schwartz and other community members.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHayden\u2019s curiosity was piqued by a previous report from The Crypto Basic highlighting Bitso\u2019s remarkable success in enabling over $3 billion in remittances between Mexico and the U.S. It bears mentioning that not all this volume involved using XRP or Ripple\u2019s product.\n\nHayden questioned how individuals in the U.S. could send such significant amounts through Bitso, given that the exchange doesn\u2019t operate within the U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nAnother community member, Scam Detective, joined the conversation, seeking clarification. Schwartz swiftly stepped in to offer an explanation, shedding light on the mechanics behind Bitso\u2019s operations.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRipple CTO\u2019s Response\n\nSchwartz clarified that Bitso\u2019s operations do not require a physical presence in the U.S. Instead, Bitso serves as an intermediary, converting the received XRP to Mexican Pesos (MXN) and facilitating domestic payments to the recipients in Mexico.\n\nWhy would Bitso need to operate in the US for this? Bitso just converts received XRP to MXN and makes a domestic Mexican payment to the recipient. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 23, 2023\n\nThe sender in the U.S. needs to transfer XRP to Bitso, which then carries out the necessary conversions and delivers the MXN to the recipient.\n\nJungle Inc., another active participant in the conversation, sought to confirm whether this process aligned with Ripple\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution. Schwartz elaborated that Bitso\u2019s role in the USD to MXN ODL flow remains the same. Whether using ODL or not, Bitso performs the crucial task of converting XRP to the destination currency while also handling the final delivery of funds.\n\nSchwartz provided further clarification in response to Jungle Inc.\u2019s query about opening a Bitso account in the U.S. for sending XRP. The CTO explained that individuals in the U.S. don\u2019t necessarily need to create accounts with Bitso.\n\nInstead, recipients in Mexico can open Bitso accounts, and anyone globally with access to XRP can send funds to them. Bitso then takes care of the XRP to MXN conversion and ensures the smooth transfer of funds.\n\nYou don't need to. The person in Mexico could open a Bitso account and then anyone in the world who could buy and transfer XRP could deliver money to them. Bitso would do the XRP->MXN conversion and the last mile. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 24, 2023\n\nThe conversation revealed that Bitso\u2019s success in facilitating cross-border remittances between the U.S. and Mexico, especially regarding Ripple\u2019s product, hinges on its ability to convert XRP to MXN and handle the last-mile delivery.\n\nSchwartz emphasized that even within Ripple\u2019s ODL framework, Bitso remains responsible for the conversion and delivery of the destination currency, maintaining no involvement with the source currency or country.\n\nDavid further said that \u201cXRP transfers value to Bitso in this transmission.\u201d\n\nXRP transfers value to Bitso in this transmission. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 24, 2023"
