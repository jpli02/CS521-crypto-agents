        "content": "A lasting legacy of Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency is the advancement of women. Among the notable outcomes of this dedicated effort by the Nixon administration was tripling the hiring of women in the Executive Branch.\n\nDuring the first year of his presidency, Nixon began an initiative to place women in positions in the federal government. Scholars, administration members, and representatives from corporate America were gathered to form The President\u2019s Task Force for Women\u2019s Rights and Responsibilities. In December of 1969 the task force issued a 33-page report with five key recommendations to change the course of women\u2019s rights and employment in the United States, beginning at the federal level.\n\nBarbara Hackman Franklin, one of the first-ever female graduates of Harvard Business School and an executive at Citibank, was tapped by Fred Malek, Special Assistant to the President for Personnel, to lead what would be the first-ever concerted effort to put women on an equal employment footing with men."

The school says it will also be better equipped to serve its 240 or so students from junior kindergarten to Grade 12.\n\nA 2021 schedule had estimated that virtually all of the work would be complete by this month. Jacobson, whose Nunakput electoral district includes Tuk, said the work was expected to cost more than $30 million.\n\nSpeaking in the legislature on Tuesday, Jacobson said the school was now forced to try renting space elsewhere in Tuk \u2013 at churches or the community hall \u2013 while awaiting the completion of refurbishment work.\n\nHe said bringing in portable classrooms represented a better alternative than taking up community spaces that ought to be used by others, and the portable units could be added to Tuk\u2019s housing stock afterward.\n\n\u201cThis is supposed to be a good news story, but now it\u2019s nothing but headaches,\u201d Jacobson said.\n\n\u201cIt has a ripple effect on my students and community. There\u2019s no gym? Mental health issues. It ripples right across the community as a whole, having no gym.\u201d\n\nInfrastructure minister Diane Archie said the GNWT has no spare portables it can send nor the budget to pay for any new ones.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the contractor to be able to get an updated schedule so that we can share that with the community,\u201d Archie said.\n\nThe minister said her department was working with the contractor to \u201callow the gym to be open at the start of the school year.\u201d"

        "content": "The closure of the Pactiv Evergreen paper mill in Canton is expected to have a significant economic impact on the area. The paper mill, set to close in late May or early June, employs hundreds of workers and has an annual payroll of about $140 million.\n\nAccording to Haywood County Economic Development Director David Francis, the loss of that infusion into the regional economy and its total ripple effect is estimated to be closer to $500 million.\n\n\u201cWe are really trying to get our heads around what this ripple effect is going to do,\u201d Francis said.\n\n\n\nThe 115-year-old paper mill its employees have an average income of $80,000 per year plus benefits. With the loss of about 900 jobs at the plant in Canton and potentially another 200 in Waynesville, the effect could be far beyond the immediate $140 million.\n\n\u201cFive-hundred million was the last estimate we had in about 2019 of their yearly impact in the economy,\u201d Francis said.\n\nThat ripple effect includes goods, like wood pulp, provided by the local logging industry, and services, like trucking and rail, that help get the product to market. However, according to , the ripple effect can be even greater.\n\n\n\n\u201cAny time you take something that has several hundred million dollars in annual economic impact out of your economy, that's not good,\u201d executive director Nathan Ramsey said.\n\nThe expended ripples will include everything from grocery stores and local small businesses to health care providers. According to Francis, the effect of the impending closure has already resulted in the closure of another local business that serves the mill.\n\n\u201cWe just learned a company in Cherokee County is going to be closing down due to their contract with Evergreen,\u201d Francis said.\n\nFor most workers, the loss of their jobs will mean entering a job market that many haven\u2019t experienced in decades. According to the Asheville/Buncombe County Chamber of Commerce, there continue to be more jobs in the area than available workers.\n\n\n\nThough this may bode well for some Evergreen employees, it may also be a challenge.\n\nAccording to Ramsey, \u201cThe challenge is, those jobs (at Evergreen) pay very well. So, the likelihood that someone can get a job paying them as well as Evergreen, in some cases, they will be able to do that. In other cases, they may struggle.\u201d\n\nHaywood County is already working with various economic groups across the region to help soften the landing for those soon-to-be displaced workers. Along with job retraining resources, they are also building a website to help Evergreen's many workers better navigate the jobs market.\n\nThe Asheville metropolitan area has a $24 billion annual economy that, according to Land of Sky, can certainly weather the economic effects of the closure. However, for those on the front line, it will still likely be a blow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bullish on our region,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI\u2019m bullish in the future of our community. But, this certainly was a gut punch.\u201d"

        "content": "POPSUGAR Photography | Renee Rodriguez POPSUGAR Photography | Renee Rodriguez\n\nEvery editorial product is independently selected by our editors. If you buy something through our links, we may earn commission.\n\nThe first time I saw someone with mermaid waves created by a flat iron, my jaw visibly dropped. I was obsessed with everything about the look. The effortless vibe, the piece-y texture \u2014 it was all that I was looking for, and everything I wanted my hair to look like. Unfortunately, when I figured out how people were achieving said waves, my jaw dropped again, and not in a good way. No matter how many different YouTube tutorials I watched or how many different straighteners I tried, I just couldn't nail it. When I found out that Jen Atkin, one of the celebrity hairstylists who practically made the style her signature, created a singular hair tool that would help me achieve the look, I knew I had to test it out, and I'm glad I did. Allow me to introduce the Mane by Mane Addicts Triple Ripple Jumbo Hair Waver ($75). Keep reading for all the details on the product, which is one of the first in her latest hair brand since Ouai, and my unfiltered review below. Mane by Mane Addicts Triple Ripple Jumbo Hair Waver From $75 $75 at maneaddicts.com About the Mane by Mane Addicts Triple Ripple Jumbo Hair Waver This hair tool features three 1.25\" barrels that are ceramic coated to create creaseless waves.\n\nIt has a removable handle for easy packing and goes up to 410 degrees.\n\nIt is suitable for all hair types, lengths, and textures.\n\nThe device has an auto shut-off after 60 minutes. How to Use the Mane by Mane Addicts Triple Ripple Jumbo Hair Waver\n\nPOPSUGAR Photography | Renee Rodriguez\n\nThe brand recommends using the waver in three simple steps: Step One: Section off your hair and start with the base of your head working upward.\n\nSection off your hair and start with the base of your head working upward. Step Two: Hold the waver horizontally and clamp each section beginning near the root.\n\nHold the waver horizontally and clamp each section beginning near the root. Step Three: After two to five seconds, continue down the length of your hair and make sure to overlap the last bend of the previous section to keep everything looking seamless. When I want a supersleek look with defined waves, I typically follow these instructions to a T after washing and rough drying my hair with a blow dryer. However, I've learned that one of the best ways to use this tool is on air-dried hair. I have a little bit of a natural wave to my hair, and I've always had a hard time styling it after it's been air-dried. My waves aren't defined enough to be worn on their own, but when I go in with a curling iron the look doesn't come off natural or cohesive. This waver allows me to add just a few waves on the top layer of my hair and leaves everything looking perfect.

We can measure and register that change, and send the data to the ground, to scientists, to analyze the data to determine what was the source of the gravitational wave.\u201d \u201cLISA is a mission that is designed to detect gravitational waves from space,\u201d Jennrich said. \u201cTo measure them, we will have three satellites in orbit and we will continuously measure the distance between the three satellites with laser links.

However, the success of LISA Pathfinder in demonstrating the feasibility of this wild concept is a source of optimism for the team.

We are very happy and I think the results give us all confidence that the same technology that we will use on LISA will work flawlessly.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that LISA Pathfinder over-fulfilled our expectations quite a bit,\u201d Jennrich said. \u201cThe performance was about, by a factor of 10, better than we designed it and expected it to be.

Once the trio has spread out into its enormous constellation and finished its tests, it will tune into the kind of low-frequency hums of the universe that have eluded scientists for centuries.

Like a giant net in outer space, the gargantuan constellation is likely to catch waves from all kinds of sources that are beyond our current imagination.

This technique allows LIGO and similar ground detectors, such as Italy\u2019s Virgo and Japan\u2019s Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector, to measure the incredibly tiny shift in the distance traveled by the lasers, signaling the presence of a wave. Since that first historic detection in 2015, LIGO and other detectors have recorded dozens of gravitational waves that have exposed the secret behaviors of exotic objects, such as black holes and neutron stars."
