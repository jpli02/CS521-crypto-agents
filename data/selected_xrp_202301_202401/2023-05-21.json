        "content": "Ripple has had a big week, to say the least.\n\nIn the SEC\u2019s case against Ripple, a judge will soon decide whether Ripple\u2019s \u201cfair notice\u201d defense is valid. The company has been claiming for over two years that it could not have registered its XRP token, due to the lack of a clear definition from the SEC regarding the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities.\n\nIn the same case, Ripple notched a victory by getting the Hinman speech documents unsealed. These documents reportedly showed that the agency did not classify ether as a security at the time when the speech in question was delivered by former SEC official William Hinman over four years ago.\n\nA day after the Hinman ruling, Ripple announced it was acquiring Metaco for $250 million in a likely play to move its business toward crypto custody.\n\nIn response, XRP has spiked nearly 8% in the last seven days.\n\nRipple has now added experienced financial executive Warren Jenson to its board of directors. Jenson served as the CFO for four different multi-billion dollar companies over the past 30 years, including Amazon, Delta Airlines, Electronic Arts and Nielsen.\n\nJenson expressed his enthusiasm at joining Ripple saying, \u201cI\u2019m excited to join Ripple at a pivotal time when cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies are increasingly becoming integrated into financial services,\u201d according to a statement provided by Ripple. \u201cFor cryptocurrency to successfully deliver on its potential to revolutionize traditional financial infrastructure, companies in the space must prioritize transparency.\u201d\n\nHe will join three fellow board members, including President Barack Obama\u2019s US Treasurer Rosie Rios, former JPMorgan Chase executive Sandie O\u2019Connor and Managing Director of Albright Stonebridge Group Michael Warren.\n\nBitget still on the hunt for employees\n\nBitget wants more jobs filled on its global team, according to the company\u2019s first quarter 2023 transparency report. The crypto exchange reiterated its call in late April to fill 300 roles.\n\n\u201cWe still have 300 openings in R&D, compliance, BD, operations and customer support,\u201d the May 17 report said.\n\nLess than a month later, the report shows that little progress has been made toward that goal, although Bitget did double its workforce in 2022 to 1,300 employees.\n\nBlockworks previously reported that Bitget introduced a $200 million protection fund in August 2022. This fund aims to safeguard investors from potential hacks and thefts, and custodies both bitcoin and tether.\n\nOther notable hires\n\nAustralian bitcoin miner Mawson Infrastructure Group hired Sandy Harrison as the Vice President of Investor Relations. Among other things, Harrison will be responsible for the company\u2019s engagement strategy on ESG initiatives.\n\nShima Capital, a Web3 venture capital firm, brought on Brandon Stahl as its new Chief Financial Officer in April and announced the move this week.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "The Ripple-SEC case has been an ongoing saga in the cryptocurrency industry, and it is about to take another intriguing turn as Ripple is expected to file the remaining permitted redactions on June 13th. This development comes after the SEC\u2019s motion to seal William Hinman\u2019s emails, a key figure in the proceedings, was rejected by Judge Torres of the District Court of the Southern District of New York.\n\nRipple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, celebrated the denial of the SEC\u2019s motion, considering it a victory for transparency. He expressed his intention for Ripple\u2019s legal team to make the contents of the emails available to the public, hinting at potentially valuable insights that could be revealed. This move aligns with Ripple\u2019s efforts to provide more clarity and transparency in the case.\n\nBill Morgan, a cryptocurrency and legal expert, has speculated that the public may learn how many of Hinman\u2019s emails Ripple cited and included in its opposition and reply briefs on June 13th. However, he cautioned that the full content of the emails related to the case might remain obscured unless they are included in the summary judgment brief, opposition brief, or reply brief.\n\nAdding another layer of intrigue to the case, John E. Deaton, the founder of Crypto Laws.us and Managing Partner of the Deaton Law Firm, believes that Hinman\u2019s emails contain details that contradict the SEC\u2019s argument against Ripple. Deaton also suggested that the emails might reveal a conflict of interest on Hinman\u2019s part, potentially weakening the SEC\u2019s stance further. If these speculations prove accurate, it could significantly impact the outcome of the case and Ripple\u2019s position.\n\nFurthermore, a closer examination of Hinman\u2019s emails could shed light on the SEC\u2019s internal discussions and perspectives on the case. The transparency provided by these emails could offer information that counters the SEC\u2019s argument against Ripple, further complicating the proceedings for the regulatory body.\n\nIn a recent development, Judge Torres also denied Ripple\u2019s motion to seal specific references, such as those linking Ripple\u2019s revenues with XRP sales. Additionally, she rejected third-party motions to redact identities and the names of public crypto trading platforms. These denials highlight the court\u2019s commitment to transparency and openness in the case.\n\nAs the Ripple-SEC case continues to unfold, the upcoming redactions on June 13th have become a focal point of interest. The crypto community eagerly awaits the unveiling of what these redactions will reveal and how they might influence the direction of the case. It is a critical juncture that could potentially shift the dynamics and narrative surrounding Ripple and its ongoing legal battle with the SEC.\n\nThe outcome of this case holds significant implications not only for Ripple and XRP but also for the broader cryptocurrency industry. It could establish legal precedents and clarify regulatory boundaries, impacting how cryptocurrencies are classified and regulated in the future. As such, the industry and stakeholders closely follow the developments in this case, recognizing its potential to shape the regulatory landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, the anticipation surrounding the Ripple-SEC case continues to grow as the filing of the remaining permitted redactions approaches. The denial of the SEC\u2019s motion to seal Hinman\u2019s emails and Ripple\u2019s commitment to transparency signal a potential shift in the narrative. The contents of these emails may provide crucial insights that could impact the outcome of the case and Ripple\u2019s position. As the crypto community eagerly awaits the revelations on June 13th, the ripple effects of this high-profile legal battle are expected to resonate throughout the cryptocurrency industry."
