        "content": "Coinbase might relist XRP if Ripple wins the ongoing lawsuit against SEC.\n\nWhales started to amass XRP anticipating a favorable verdict.\n\nCoinbase, the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, may have given the XRP community one of the biggest reasons to cheer.\n\nIn an interview with Thinking Crypto host Tony Edward, Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Paul Grewal hinted that the exchange might relist XRP if the verdict in the two-year-long Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit comes in the former\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cI am very eager as anyone else to see how the court rules and what I can say, as soon as we have the ruling, we will put in our process to see if we need to revisit our listing decision.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CLO added that the conditions for the same will depend on the basis for the ruling, the judge\u2019s legal reasoning, and Coinbase\u2019s assessment of whether or not the appeals court will uphold the decision.\n\nCoinbase announced the delisting of XRP from the exchange in December 2020, soon after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs over claims that the token was a security.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 XRPs worth today?\n\nThe crypto community awaits summary judgment\n\nNotably, the controversial case is moving to its conclusion, as the verdict is speculated to come in the first half of 2023. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse earlier said that he was confident of Ripple\u2019s chances.\n\nThe verdict could have significant implications for the wider cryptocurrency market. The laws governing the status of cryptocurrencies as commodities or securities are still not very clear.\n\nThere were early signs that after XRP, U.S. regulators were training their guns on the second-largest crypto in the ecosystem, Ethereum [ETH].\n\nRecently, New York State Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the crypto exchange Kucoin for issuing tokens that fit the definition of securities. One of the tokens mentioned in the lawsuit was ETH.\n\nWhales spring into action\n\nMeanwhile, anticipating a favorable decision, whales started to amass XRP in bulk. The number of addresses holding between 1,000 to 1 million coins increased significantly over the past month, as per Santiment.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s XRP\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nA reason for the accumulation could be that most sellers were giving away tokens at a discount, as shown by falling transaction volume in profit.\n\nThe 30-day MVRV Ratio treaded in negative territory, which lent further credence to the observation. The negative MVRV Long/Short Difference highlighted that short-term holders will realize higher profits.\n\nMoreover, at the time of writing, XRP jumped 4.55% in the 24-hr period, as per CoinMarketCap."

        "title": "Why bank crash isn't cause for panic in the startup nation - ISRAEL21c",
        "content": "The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the 16th-largest bank in the United States, has sent shockwaves throughout the global financial markets.\n\nAs the provider of banking services to nearly half of tech and life-science ventures, it is (or was) the go-to bank for the venture-backed startup market.\n\nFor Israelis, this begs the question: How might this seismic event influence the wellbeing of our own high-tech startup environment?\n\nThere have been any number of explanations for the cause of the failure, with the most popular being a run on the bank by its customers. A \u201crun on a bank\u201d is when a large number of a bank\u2019s customers try to withdraw their money from the institution.\n\nAt any given time, a bank doesn\u2019t have all the money deposited with it; rather, the money has been lent out to borrowers.\n\nNot all money on deposit is lent out. Some is held as \u201creserves\u201d so that the bank has cash for ordinary withdrawals by depositors. However, if too many depositors try to withdraw their money at the same time, the bank will collapse.\n\nWill SVB\u2019s collapse have a substantial ripple effect in Israel, home to \u201cSilicon Wadi,\u201d the tech startup scene that resembles Silicon Valley?\n\nThe short answer is: There won\u2019t be a significant impact.\n\nGood shock absorbers\n\nIsrael\u2019s economy is strong enough to absorb the shock and move on.\n\nThis isn\u2019t meant to sugar-coat the events in the US, as there will be some consequences.\n\nThe collapse of the bank means that some of its clients, including Israeli firms, won\u2019t have access to their funds to cover payroll and other obligations. Unless they have access to other funds, that could push them under.\n\nMany, even most, will have access to other funds. If a venture has promise of success, current investors may lend or invest additional funds in the venture to keep it going.\n\nSimilarly, other investors may also offer to provide funds to the venture.\n\nThe threat of bankruptcy results from the failure of a bank holding its money. A viable business will always be able to find additional funds.\n\nLayoffs vs. positive trends\n\nThat said, the timing isn\u2019t ideal. The Israeli high-tech industry, like that of the US, is currently downsizing \u2014 an elegant word for laying off workers.\n\nFor high-tech workers, this isn\u2019t an auspicious time for another blow to the high-tech industry. The result is that we could see a period of heightened layoffs in the high-tech industry in Israel.\n\nIf the layoffs become too significant, this could impact the real-estate industry, which is a major beneficiary of the salaries high-tech workers have been earning.\n\nProf. Micheal Humphries of Jerusalem College of Technology. Photo courtesy of JCT\n\nIsrael\u2019s economy, however, is strong enough to handle the fall. The number of job vacancies, a measure of the economy\u2019s strength, was 142,730 at the end of January 2023 (the most recent data available), up a pinch from December 2022.\n\nThe Central Bureau of Statistics\u2019 Business Tendency Survey, published February 6, 2023, revealed positive economic trends. Foreign tourism has been up 2.9 in the past three months and 4.8% in the prior three-month period.\n\nRecession unlikely\n\nA slowdown in the high-tech sector of the economy will definitely affect the overall economic forecast. However, a recession in Israel due to the banking crises in the U.S. is unlikely.\n\nOn top of the strength of the economy, the government\u2019s promise of intervention, if necessary, further reduces the likelihood of a recession.\n\nWould the government have the resources to finance support of the local high-tech industry?\n\nThis past January, the Finance Ministry confirmed that the previous 12 months (2022) had seen a budget surplus generated by increased revenues, not by decreased expenditures, as was the case in the past.\n\nIn other words, the Israeli economy is performing well enough to the point where tax revenue exceeded government spending.\n\nAccordingly, we can assume that the government will have the necessary funds to stem the tide of a potential recession.\n\nUltimately, that\u2019s why the collapse of SVB shouldn\u2019t make Israelis panic.\n\nMicheal Humphries teaches marketing and management at the Jerusalem College of Technology \u2013 Lev Academic Center and is deputy chairman of the Business Administration Department at Touro College Israel, where he teaches finance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT"
