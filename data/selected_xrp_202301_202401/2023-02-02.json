        "title": "Smartphone replacements decline, with ripple effects for carriers - Fierce Network",
        "content": "The three big wireless operators in the U.S. have all completed their fourth quarter 2022 earnings reports. And the analysts at LightShed Partners are calling out smartphone upgrade rates at these operators.\n\nThe analysts \u2014 Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone \u2014 note that people are keeping their smartphones longer than they used to. They said T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon all reported notable declines in their smartphone upgrade rates in Q4.\n\n\u201cT-Mobile\u2019s decline was the most dramatic,\u201d wrote LightShed. \u201cIts upgrade rate plummeted to 3.9% from 5.8% last year. That drove a 28% drop in the number of phones it sold in Q4. In fact, T-Mobile sold fewer phones in Q4 than it did in Q3. We don\u2019t recall that ever happening before.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that upgrade rates declined at AT&T, as well. That operator raised prices on some of its lower-tier plans in 2022, and made a concerted effort to convert those subscribers to newer plans, which logically often causes people to upgrade their phones.\n\nAT&T\u2019s CFO Pascal Desroches recently said that in 2022, \u201cOur fastest growing plans are our higher-tier plans. The uptake to the higher-tier plans was a little bit better than we anticipated.\u201d\n\nAnother variable is phone payment plans.\n\nAT&T, and more recently Verizon, have begun extending the length of phone payment plans from two years to three years. \u201cWe suspect T-Mobile won't be far behind,\u201d wrote LightShed.\n\nBy extending the length of phone payment plans, carriers benefit from reduced churn. Customers who are paying off their phones are more likely to stick with their current provider. But the downside is that these customers don\u2019t give much thought to upgrading their phones, or their plans, during their phone payment periods.\n\neSIM\n\nThe U.S. carriers finally embraced eSIM in 2022, which makes it easier for subscribers to churn from one carrier to another without having to manually switch SIM cards.\n\nBut this might result in people keeping their existing phones even longer. They no longer have to visit a retail store to switch providers. And visiting the retail store is where they would be up-sold to a newer phone.\n\nSo, eSIM could have the negative effect of increased churn without the opportunity of selling more phones on payment plans and upselling to higher-tier plans.\n\nApple and Samsung\n\nThe fact that people are keeping their phones longer is not good news for Apple, which reports its earnings this afternoon. Apple also had to deal with major factory disruptions in China during its latest quarter, which are predicted to dampen its iPhone sales.\n\nLightShed wrote, \u201cThe largest operators in the U.S. alone sold over 115 million phones in 2022, and we believe Apple has north of 50% market share. Qualitatively, we believe the declining upgrade rates in the U.S. provide a valid indicator to replacement cycles globally.\u201d\n\nYesterday, Samsung unveiled its latest line of smartphones, the Galaxy S23 series.\n\nRelated Samsung omits satellite connectivity in Galaxy S23 series devices\n\nUnlike Apple, the new Samsung phones do not include any mobile-to-satellite connectivity."

        "title": "Ripple, XDC Network, and cardano are three altcoins that are non-correlated to bitcoin - crypto.news",
        "content": "With the cryptocurrency market becoming increasingly competitive, investors are always looking for ways to diversify their portfolios. One strategy is to gain exposure in non-correlated altcoins.\n\nWe will explore the potential benefits of holding Ripple (XRP), XDC Network, and cardano (ADA). These three altcoins are non-correlated to bitcoin (BTC) . We will also analyze their features, potential returns, and more.\n\nUncovering the potential of bitcoin non-correlated altcoins: Ripple, XDC Network, and Cardano\n\nBitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency and remains highly influential on the rest of the market. Ripple, XDC Network, and Cardano are all non-correlated altcoins, meaning their performance is not dependent on Bitcoin\u2019s market movements. This feature makes them attractive to those who want to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios.\n\nBitcoin\u2018s price movements can directly influence altcoins, sometimes positively influencing their valuation. However, historical data shows that XRP, XDC, and ADA exist independently. They are less closely linked to Bitcoin than other altcoins.\n\nGaining exposure in these coins can protect against bitcoin\u2019s volatility while also offering potential gains should BTC continue rallying.\n\nDue to their non-correlation and volatility, these three altcoins tend to yield more than BTC over the long term, given the right conditions and strategies.\n\nThe XDC Network\u2019s underlying technology and growing ecosystem makes it reliable. XDC Network\u2019s consensus algorithm, XDPOS 2.0, is secure and energy efficient, making it an option for traders who want to diversify their portfolios. The platform has consistently weathered the volatility that comes with BTC and other major altcoins like XRP, outperforming them despite market downturns. As the XDC Network develops new features and gains adoption, investors can capitalize on the coin\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nRipple, XDC Network, and Cardano also share several characteristics, such as low transaction fees, high scalability, and secure protocols.\n\nThe XDC Network, unlike Ripple and Cardano, uses the XDPOS consensus mechanism, which is more efficient and secure than proof-of-work algorithms. XDC Network also has a layered architecture that features distinct layers for control and data processing, making XDC Network more energy efficient than Bitcoin.\n\nComparing XDC Network to Bitcoin and Other Altcoins: exploring the benefits of Ripple, Cardano, and XDC Network\n\nBitcoin has primarily been used as a means of payment and does not facilitate investments in the same way that Ripple, Cardano, and XDC Network do. Ripple can quickly move funds across borders instantaneously and cheaply while providing users with privacy. The XDC Network allows users to create real-world tokenized assets. Ripple and Cardano also have blockchain-based technologies which support smart contracts, enabling users to make secure transactions across networks.\n\nAll three of these altcoins provide various benefits that Bitcoin cannot offer, including being energy-efficient, and cost-effective. Ultimately, Bitcoin remains popular among users due to its ease of use and convenience. However, gaining exposure in XRP, ADA, or XDC can be more rewarding.\n\nConclusion\n\nInvesting in non-correlated altcoins can help diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio. Users who gain exposure to XRP, XDC, and ADA may benefit from the respective platform\u2019s features and, possibly, post returns from their coins in the long haul.\n\nNonetheless, it is essential to conduct thorough research before investing in any of these altcoins and ensure you understand the risks involved. If used correctly, these altcoins can provide a solid foundation for your investment strategy."

        "content": "Power Supply Quality\n\nAs part of our testing, we also check output parameters are within specifications, as well as voltage ripple and line noise.\n\nMain Output Load (Watts) 201.76 W 503.66 W 752.15 W 1000.08 W Load (Percent) 20.18% 50.37% 75.22% 100.01% Amperes Volts Amperes Volts Amperes Volts Amperes Volts 3.3 V 2.01 3.37 5.03 3.35 7.55 3.32 10.06 3.31 5 V 2.01 5.16 5.03 5.14 7.55 5.11 10.06 5.08 12 V 15.27 12.09 38.19 12.07 57.28 12.02 76.37 11.99\n\nLine Regulation\n\n(20% to 100% load) Voltage Ripple (mV) 20% Load 50% Load 75% Load 100% Load CL1\n\n12V CL2\n\n3.3V + 5V 3.3V 1.6% 8 8 10 12 10 12 5V 1.5% 8 10 12 12 12 10 12V 0.8% 10 10 16 22 20 24\n\nThe electrical performance of the MSI MPG A1000G PCIE5 PSU is surprisingly good for a PSU of this class. As a matter of fact, the MPG A1000G theoretically provides better power quality than its otherwise superior MEG Ai1300P. Though such a comparison is not entirely fair due to the 30% greater power output of the latter.\n\nNevertheless, our instruments recorded a maximum ripple of 22 mV on the 12V line with a recommended design limit of 120 mV, a very low figure for any PC PSU. The filtering of the minor voltage lines is equally good, with a maximum of 10 mV and 12 mV on the 3.3V and 5V lines respectively. Voltage regulation is very tight on the 12V line, at less than 0.8%. It is not as tight on the minor voltage lines, where the regulation is at about 1.5%, but that still is a good performance figure.\n\nAs part of our standard testing, we test the primary protections of all PSUs we review (Over Current, Over Voltage, Over Power, and Short Circuit). The MSI MPG A1000G PCIE5 successfully passed all of the tests, as in all of the protections do work. The OCP protection is set very high though, with our testing reaching over 140% current on any voltage line for several seconds before the unit shuts down. Similarly, the OPP protection also is high, as we drew over 1300 Watts from the MPG A1000G PCIE5 before it decided to shut down. These high figures clearly are due to the tweaks that give the MPG A1000G PCIE5 its ATX 3.0 compatibility, as the engineers had to ensure that the unit would not be shutting down due to power excursions that need to be met for ATX 3.0 compliance.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnlike halo products which frequently compete in terms of innovation and/or performance \u2013 and where value is a secondary concern \u2013 the MPG A1000G PCIE5 is targeted towards a market segment where users weigh every factor, with price being one of the most important. In configuring their new PSU, MSI had to convince users that the MPG A1000G PCIE5 can offer good all-around performance and long-term reliability, while also offering it at a competitive price. Otherwise it would not stand a chance in the mainstream market, even at the highest layers of it.\n\nMSI can certainly boast about the quality of the MPG A1000G PCIE5. Despite the relatively simple topology and the use of mid-range active components, each and every component found in the unit is of top quality. CWT did an excellent job designing this platform and layout too. It is very crowded and probably disadvantageous for the manufacturer themselves, but it manages to offer enough clearance for a 135 mm fan to fit and still the heatsinks are sizable, which plays a major role in the thermal performance and long-term reliability of the PSU.\n\nIn terms of performance, the MSI MPG A1000G PCIE5 did very well, perhaps even a little better than what we usually expect such a product to reach. It delivers exceptional power quality, with minimal voltage fluctuations across the entire load range. The energy conversion efficiency is stellar at low loads but drops sharply at high loads, resulting in the 80Plus Gold certification. It also runs relatively cool, which is a very good thing for the long-term reliability of any such design. The only weak link here is the aggressive cooling profile \u2013 on one hand, it is responsible for keeping the operating temperatures very low but, on the other hand, it also makes the MPG A1000G PCIE5 run loud when having to cope with loads greater than 500 Watts. Our only true concern lies with the very slack OCP/OPP protections \u2013 they do work but these seem to be set a little too high, which limits the unit\u2019s ability to timely react to a real fault and properly protect the rest of the equipment.\n\nIn summary, the MSI MPG A1000G PCIE5 is a fairly well-balanced product for users who want to buy a powerful PSU that will last them for many years to come. Even if purchasing a video card with a 12VHPWR connector is not in a user\u2019s immediate plans, the ATX 3.0 compliance ensures that the PSU will not be rendered obsolete if a user later upgrades to one.\n\nThe current street price of $199 is a bit higher than ATX 2.52 compliant units with similar characteristics, but it's competitive enough to entice users who want to purchase a high-quality and relatively future-proof product. MSI will have to make sure that they don't rest on their laurels, however, as there are numerous competing mid-to-high tier ATX 3.0 PSUs that will be coming out in the following weeks and months."
