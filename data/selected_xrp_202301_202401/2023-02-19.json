        "title": "Dupe alert! Dormify is selling a $35 version of a $500 Jonathan Adler mirror - Real Homes",
        "content": "Yes, ripple mirrors are still trending. Don't believe me? Just take a scroll through my Instagram feed, and I'll easily prove you wrong. At one point, I was very much lusting after one of these mirrors. What put me off? The hefty price tag, and before you suggest it: DIYing isn't even an option as I'm a total klutz. So, it wasn't until I spotted this dupe when browsing Dormify that I realized my ripple mirror dreams might finally come true.\n\nYes, this mirror looks exactly the same as Jonathan Adler's famous ripple mirror, which costs $500. For anyone who thinks that's a little too much for a mirror (me included), what I am about to show you is a top-notch find. Dormify's own dupe looks wildly similar and it's only $35.\n\nI love this as a vanity mirror or leaned against a wall atop a dresser. If your landlord is a generous one, then you can obvi hang it on your wall. Just be sure to place it somewhere where it will bounce light around your space. It could also work as an entryway mirror if you don't want to confine it to your bedroom. Regardless, get this mirror in your shopping cart stat.\n\nThe Jonathan Adler mirror dupe\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nOther than the huge price difference, the Dormify dupe comes in small or medium, and in your choice of pink or white. Over at Jonathan Adler, the mirror comes in a slightly bigger size than the medium, but in white or blue."

        "title": "Why do icicles have ripples? Scientists say it's all about salt - - Study Finds",
        "content": "AMSTERDAM, Netherlands \u2014 In the book \u201cThe Lovely Bones,\u201d Susie Salmon says an icicle is the perfect murder weapon, and that proves to be the case when an icicle falls and kills her murderer while he was out stalking his next victim. One of the unique features of an icicle is the one-centimeter ripples, though there are some questions why they appear in the first place. In a new study, scientists from Netherlands say icicle ripple formation is largely due to the concentration of salt in the frozen ice water.\n\nIn nature, water always carries a small amount of salt. With more salt, the more likely you\u2019ll find visible ripples in icicles. The study authors came to this conclusion after looking at the frozen structures created from their very own icicle machine.\n\n\u201cIn a large freezer with a window, we spent a few weeks becoming true icicle growth specialists,\u201d says Menno Demmenie, a PhD student at the Institute of Physics and the Van \u2019t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences at the University of Amsterdam, in a media release.\n\nThe main issue throughout the experiment was how quickly they needed to add water before making a \u201cnice\u201d icicle. If you poured water too fast, most of the water would fall to the floor of the freezer into a sheet of ice. Going too slow was just as bad. A slow water flow would make the icicle grow upward, like a stalagmite.\n\nIf you had any desire to create an icicle, scientists found the optimal rate of growth happens with an inflow of 60 milliliters per hour, at 5\u00b0F.\n\n\u201cThis is comparable to a faucet dripping roughly once every three seconds,\u201d describes Demmenie.\n\nOnce they figured out how to make nicely shaped icicles, the researchers used the machine to create multiple icicles under different circumstances and with different types of water. The results show the most important factor in icicle ripple formation is the salt concentration in the water. Icicles made with pure water made less visible ripples than icicles created from salty water.\n\nThe researchers realized salt was the main component to rippled icicles by looking at their molecular composition. When the water forming around an icicle freezes, salt molecules are pushed out of the ice as \u201cimpurities.\u201d The banished salt molecules take refuge in a thin layer of liquid water on the outside of the icicle.\n\nThe team also added a coloring agent to the water used to make icicles, which allowed them to see the flow of water versus where the salt went when frozen. With pure water, the layer of salty liquid water around the icicle was gone and its formation process looked a lot like a dripping candle. When freezing salty water, the icicle developed a thin film of liquid, salty water, and the flow of that water created the ripples. The more salt, the stronger the process to create thicker and more visible ripples.\n\nThe findings appear in the journal Physical Review Applied."
