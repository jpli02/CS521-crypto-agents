        "title": "Ripple CTO Outlines 3 Reasons Not To Hold XRP in AMM - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "According to the CTO of Ripple, there are only three identifiable risks of holding XRP in an AMM, which could include exposure to other assets.\n\nRipple\u2019s CTO David Schwartz recently outlined three potential risks of holding XRP in an Automated Market Maker (AMM). When asked how much of his XRP tokens he intends to hold in the forthcoming AMM set to go live on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), Schwartz made this disclosure.\n\nProbably between 1/3 and 1/4. There are really only three reasons not hold your XRP in an AMM:\n\n1) There could be an implementation bug in the AMM code that causes you to lose money. A low risk, but non-zero. \u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 25, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAn AMM is a decentralized exchange that uses mathematical algorithms to determine the price of traded assets. Traders can trade their assets directly with a liquidity pool, a pool of funds contributed by other traders, without relying on a central authority. Ripple unveiled a native AMM for XRPL in July 2022.\n\nWith the launch of the XRPL AMM drawing closer, Schwartz revealed that he plans to hold between a third to a fourth of his total XRP bag in the upcoming AMM.\n\nSchwartz noted that he could only identify three risks associated with holding XRP in an AMM, and they include the following:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nImplementation Bug\n\nAn AMM allows traders to trade a pair of two different assets. In the context of XRP, an XRP/USD AMM would allow people to trade XRP for USD.\n\nAn implementation bug in the AMM code could cause errors in the price calculation or lead to other technical issues that result in people losing money when using the AMM. While the risk of this happening is low, it is still possible.\n\nExposure to Other Assets Besides XRP\n\nWhen using an AMM, you are not just trading XRP. You also trade another asset paired with XRP, such as USD or BTC.\n\nIf you choose an XRP/USD AMM, you are also exposed to the risk that the USD issuer you pick may collapse or fail. In other words, if the USD issuer goes bankrupt or becomes insolvent, the value of the USD you hold may decrease, resulting in a loss for you.\n\nSelling XRP the Whole Way up\n\nIf XRP increases in price rapidly, you may not gain as much by using an AMM as you would by simply holding onto your XRP tokens. This is because when using an AMM, you constantly sell and buy XRP as the price fluctuates. However, using an AMM can also help you mitigate losses if XRP prices drop significantly."

        "title": "Luminox Introduces The Pacific Diver Ripple Collection Of Watches With 39mm Cases - aBlogtoWatch",
        "content": "As one of the perennial favorite brands among law enforcement and military personnel, Luminox has a pedigree within the world of tool watches that is truly undisputed. However, the average case size of Luminox watches is generally quite large, and many of the brand\u2019s models offer a thoroughly tactical aesthetic that can sometimes limit their versatility in everyday life. That said, Luminox\u2019s catalog is far more diverse than most people actually acknowledge, and as the brand\u2019s latest release for 2023, Luminox has expanded its popular Pacific Diver series with six new models that are all based upon a more compact 39mm case. Offering much of the same core design as the full-size 44mm versions of the model, the new Luminox Pacific Diver Ripple collection brings this versatile platform to a much wider range of wrist sizes, while also promising to be a timepiece that can more easily fit into a normal non-tactical lifestyle.\n\nThe new Luminox Pacific Diver Ripple watches all feature 39mm cases made from 316L stainless steel that offer the same shape and profile as the full-size Pacific Diver range. While five of the six new models offer cases with a brushed and polished finish, the final version offers a black PVD-coated case for a more understated overall appearance. Similarly, all six of the models feature anti-reflective sapphire crystals above their dials, along with screw-down crowns and casebacks to help support their 200 meters of water resistance. Regardless of their differences, the cases of all six Luminox Pacific Diver Ripple watches are fitted with black unidirectional bezels that are made from CARBONOX (Luminox\u2019s proprietary carbon-composite material), which have white markings and an orange-glowing tritium tube embedded at the zero marker.\n\nAdvertising Message\n\nBeyond the black-finished case on one model, where the six new 39mm Luminox Pacific Diver Ripple watches differ most is in regards to the dials and straps that are fitted to them. The ref. 3127M is the version with the blacked-out case, and it comes fitted with a white dial and a black rubber strap. Meanwhile, the ref. 3124M, ref. ref. 3126M, and ref. 3128M all feature mother-of-pearl dials, with the only difference between the trio being that the ref. 3126M is fitted with a stainless steel Jubilee-style bracelet, while the ref. 3124M receives a light blue rubber strap, and the ref. 3128M is sold as a set with two different rubber straps in both white and bright pink, along with an included strap-changing tool.\n\nThe final two models that make up the new 39mm Luminox Pacific Diver Ripple collection are the ref. 3122M, which is fitted with a black dial and a stainless steel bracelet, while the ref. 3123M is fitted with a blue sunburst dial and sold as a set with both a stainless steel Jubilee-style bracelet and a dark blue rubber strap (along with a strap-changing tool). Based on the press photos, the rubber straps appear to be the style that is cut down to fit the individual owner\u2019s wrist, and just like what can be found on the stainless steel bracelet, they are fitted with a signed deployant style folding clasp that features a push button release and an additional safety latch that folds over the top.\n\nWhile the white and mother-of-pearl dial models all feature black-finished hands and hour markers, both the blue and black dial variants receive these details in white for better contrast. All of the dials feature date windows at 3 o\u2019clock, along with an angled rehaut that contains both the minute track and the horizontally-placed tritium gas-filled tubes that provide a continuous glow for up to 25 years without receiving any light exposure. Just like other Luminox watches, the new Pacific Diver Ripple collection embraces a two-color luminous display, and while the majority of the tritium tubes emit a green glow, the tubes placed on the minute hand and at the 12 o\u2019clock marker (along with the tube at the zero marker within the bezel) glow orange to help offer added contrast while tracking elapsed time in low-light settings.\n\nAdvertising Message\n\nPowering the new 39mm Luminox Pacific Diver Ripple watches is the Ronda 515 quartz movement, which is the same battery-powered quartz caliber that can be found inside a number of other Luminox models, along with a wide variety of other watches from countless different manufacturers. Powered by a single 395 cell and offering a battery life of approximately 50 months, the Ronda 515 is anything but an auspicious movement, although it offers a proven design with known-quantity performance, and ultimately is a very practical option for a battery-powered quartz watch. While there are some people who believe that all quartz watches should be solar-powered these days, having a movement that requires light exposure slightly goes against the core benefit of tritium tubes and their ability to work continuously for years at a time in total darkness. That said, I highly doubt that most people who buy one of the new Luminox Pacific Diver Ripple watches plan on spending extended periods in the dark, and a light-powered movement would likely have been an added convenience to these particular models.\n\nAs the new 39mm Luminox Pacific Diver Ripple collection is essentially a more compact rendition of the existing 44mm time-and-date series, prices for the new models are largely the same as their full-size counterparts. Given the different straps and case finishing present throughout the range, prices can slightly vary depending on the specific model and its configuration, although all of the new Luminox Pacific Diver Ripple watches are still accompanied by an official retail price of $645 USD to $745 USD. While mother-of-pearl dials don\u2019t cost a premium, the least expensive options are those fitted with a single rubber strap, while the most expensive will be the version sold as a set with both a rubber strap and a stainless steel bracelet. Many people outside of law enforcement and military circles appreciate Luminox watches for their superior low-light legibility, and I imagine that these new compact 39mm divers will be especially popular among individuals who want the core experience of a Luminox in a highly-wearable everyday package.

        "content": "This time Zeppeli takes the \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d \u2026Once again, beware the spoilers!\n\nIt is no easy task to defeat a vampire, especially if the vampire is Dio. Luckily for Jonathan, he has a mentor who knows just what to do.\n\nWill Anthonio Zeppeli.\n\nThe Italian Zeppeli family \u2014 who borrow their name from the British rock band Led Zeppelin (a reference the mangaka Hirohiko Araki later felt he had used too early on in the series) \u2014 are allies of the Joestar clan in Parts One and Two (and later make a return in Part Seven).\n\nA young Will Zeppeli followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and became an archaeologist. Together with a team from the university, they traveled the world discovering lost artifacts and civilizations. On one such trip to Mexico where they were excavating an Aztec ruin, the Stone Mask was unearthed.\n\nTragedy strikes on the journey back. Difficult to resist the temptation of the Stone Mask, a lone crew member wears it and slaughters 58 poor souls aboard the ship \u2014 the perpetrator none other than Zeppeli\u2019s own father who is scorched by the light of the morning sun when dawn broke.\n\n\u201cAnd if you feel that you can\u2019t go on/And your will\u2019s sinking low Just believe, and you can\u2019t go wrong/ In the light you will find the road/You will find the road\u201c \u201cIn the Light\u201d\n\nJimmy Page used a violin bow for the guitar intro and the result is a distinct sound blended with the synthesizer. Page had said that song was the follow-up to \u201cStairway to Heaven.\u201d It is built on the foundations of the song \u201cIn the Morning\u201d and was originally titled \u201cTake Me Home.\u201d The somber tune compliments Will Zeppeli\u2019s predicament \u2014 Young Zeppeli, the sole survivor (he had the foresight to jump into the sea when the massacre began), is rescued by a fishing boat.\n\nDetermined to destroy the Stone Mask, Zeppeli\u2019s journey brings him to India where he encounters a man who is able to heal even the gravest of wounds. On his advice, Zeppeli seeks out his master \u2014 Tonpetty (named after musician Tom Petty). Tonpetty teaches Zeppeli the way of the Ripple (Hamon), an ancient form of martial arts. This breathing technique allows the user to manifest energy similar to the rays of the sun on the body, in the form of ripples.\n\n\u201cIt starts out like a murmur/Then it grows like thunder Until it bursts inside of you/Try to hold it steady Wait until you\u2019re ready/Any second now will do\u201c\n\n\u201cWearing and Tearing,\u201d Led Zeppelin\u2019s final song on their last album, Coda, (1982) was their answer to the growing punk rock scene that bloomed in the late Seventies. The Ripple technique similarly was the answer to beat vampires, pillar men and zombies whose weakness was the sun.\n\n\u201cIn the pits you go no lower/The next stop\u2019s underground Oh, hello, underground/Your wine and roses ain\u2019t quite over Fate deals a losing hand\u201c\n\nTonpetty has a premonition. He warns Zeppeli that were he (Zeppeli) to go down this path, the only thing waiting for him at the end would be death. Zeppeli however is unfazed, resigned to his fate. He completes his training and sets off to find the Stone Mask.\n\nHis search leads him to Jonathan, who was recuperating after his fight with the newly-turned Dio. He heals Jonathan\u2019s shattered arm and offers to teach him the way of the Ripple. Jonathan\u2019s first task \u2014 to defeat Jack the Ripper, who had been zombified by Dio. Cue in the \u201cImmigrant Song.\u201c\n\n\u201cThe hammer of the gods/Will drive our ships to new land To fight the horde, sing and cry/Valhalla, I am coming\u201c\n\nZeppeli leaves Jonathan with a cryptic piece of advice, \u201cThe Northern Wind Made the Vikings\u201d and a full glass of wine, of which he must not spill a single drop. Jonathan completes his task successfully, harnessing the power of the Ripple with Zeppeli remarking that the \u201cNorth Wind\u201d has made a \u201cViking\u201d of Jonathan.\n\nAnd so, the three (Zeppeli, Jonathan and Speedwagon) of them set off to defeat Dio and his army of zombies.\n\n\u201cWalking side by side with death/The devil mocks their every step, ooh The snow drives back the foot that\u2019s slow/The dogs of doom are howling more, oh\u201c\n\nDio is quick to reveal himself to the challengers, prompting Zeppeli to battle him, alone. Dio is a challenging opponent. Realizing the power of the Ripple might be his undoing, he freezes Zeppeli\u2019s arm, rendering him unable to use the Ripple. Speedwagon comes to his aid, thawing his arm.\n\nOh, dance in the dark of night/Sing to the morning light\n\nThe dark Lord rides in force tonight/And time will tell us all\n\nOh, throw down your plow and hoe/Rest not to lock your homes\n\nSide by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all\n\nOh-oh\n\nI hear the horses\u2019 thunder down in the valley below/I\u2019m waiting for the angels of Avalon\n\nWaiting for the eastern glow\n\n\u201cThe Battle of Evermore\u201d is the only Led Zeppelin song to feature a guest vocalist, Sandy Denny (member of British folk band Fairport Convention). The track is also unconventional due to the absence of John Bonham\u2019s drumming and the use of the mandolin. Replete with references from Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings, the song describes the balance between good and evil, and the heavy price that goes into maintaining it.\n\nZeppeli ultimately falls in a fierce battle he and Jonathan wage against Tarkus (a reference to the Emerson, Lake and Palmer album of the same name). Tarkus\u2019 chains break Jonathan\u2019s neck and slice Zeppeli into two at the waist. By sheer willpower, in his last moments, Zeppeli gives the last of his life energy and power to heal Jonathan\u2019s wounds.\n\n\u201cIn my time of dying, want nobody to mourn\u201c\n\nZeppeli tells Jonathan not to grieve and instead implores Jonathan to finish this fight, defeat Dio once and for all and destroy the Stone Mask, to put an end to the battle.\n\n\u201cDull is the armour, cold is the day/Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way\u201c\n\nZeppeli did not live to see Jonathan fight Dio. But he knew that his will would live on via Jonathan. And so, on that battlefield Will Antonio Zeppeli climbs the Stairway to Heaven.\n\nWill Anthonio Zeppeli\u2019s Discography\n\nIn order of appearance\n\n\u201cIn the Light\u201d (Album: Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\n\u201cWearing and Tearing\u201d (Album: Coda, 1982)\n\n\u201cFor Your Life\u201d (Album: Presence,1976)\n\n\u201cImmigrant Song\u201d (Album: Led Zeppelin III,1970)\n\n\u201cNo Quarter\u201d (Album: Houses of the Holy, 1973)\n\n\u201cThe Battle of Evermore\u201d (Album: Led Zeppelin IV, 1971)\n\n\u201cIn My Time of Dying\u201d (Album: Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\n\u201cCarouselambra\u201d (Album: In Through the Out Door, 1979)\n\n\u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d (Album: Led Zeppelin IV, 1971)"

        "title": "'Calendar Girls' ripple effect reaches Sequim - Sequim Gazette",
        "content": "When the ladies of Rylstone Women\u2019s Institute produced their calendar of sepia-toned nudes in 1999, they couldn\u2019t have known the actions they took would resonate so strongly with the public that they\u2019d raise more than six million pounds for Blood Cancer UK and their story would inspire countless interviews and articles, more calendars, books, a movie, a musical.\n\nAnd also a play, which local thespians and crew say has affected their own lives and perspectives on the female body and story \u2014 in all its variations.\n\nOlympic Theatre Arts\u2019 \u201cCalendar Girls,\u201d written by Tim Firth and directed by Ellen Butchart, opens on April 28 and runs through May 14, with showtimes at 7 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and 2 p.m. on Sundays.\n\nThe 14-person cast features both new actors and veterans of the OTA stage in what representatives say is \u201cabout coming-of-age at any age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a charming, funny, ribald tale of the enduring power of sisterhood, friendship and long-lived relationships. It is also a story about ambition unrealized, the inevitability of loss and the distinct possibility that we all grow better as we grow older.\u201d\n\nTickets are $20 and available online at olympictheatrearts.org or by calling the box office (360-683-7326) between 1-4 p.m., Tuesday through Friday.\n\nThe two-act dramedy resembles the movie of the same name, which was inspired by the real-life story of the ladies of Rylstone, Yorkshire, England, but has \u201clots of differences,\u201d said Butchart.\n\n\u201cThis is so much more economical. It covers a shorter span of time.\u201d\n\nButchart said that as soon as she heard that \u201cCalendar Girls\u201d had been voted for as the OTA Members\u2019 Choice play for 2023, she asked to direct it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there are enough plays about women,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is really a narrative centered on women\u2019s stories. It\u2019s such a privilege.\u201d\n\nButchart has a extensive background in film, but said this is her first time directing a play, and that Marissa Meek has been helping her learn her new role.\n\n\u201cI think of her as a journey-woman of the theater,\u201d Butchart said.\n\n\u201cTheater is all about collaboration,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u2018Empowerment a theme\u2019\n\nButchart praised the dedication of the cast and their willingness to work through their own discomfort to portray the evolution of their characters.\n\n\u201cThis group of middle-aged and older women live in a small rural community. Their lives have been defined by narrow cultural expectations and limited by the opportunities open to them,\u201d said Butchart, noting that though the play is set in England, following the playwright\u2019s instructions the actors are not changing their accents.\n\n\u201cWhen the husband [John] of one of the \u2018girls\u2019 dies from cancer, they decide to step way, way out of their comfort zones, and the safe spaces that they\u2019ve inhabited, to raise money for a comfortable couch in the family sitting room of their local hospital. In their courageous and generous act of raising money by posing nude in their Women\u2019s Institute calendar, they learn confidence, body positivity, and support each other through other difficult life events.\u201d\n\nBoth crew and cast members spoke of \u201cempowerment\u201d as a major theme of this play.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the takeaway is the empowerment of women,\u201d co-director William Stone said. \u201cThe play has been eye-opening for me. I\u2019ve learned a lot.\u201d\n\nStone said that the play is fast-moving, with lots of props and a big cast, including complete newcomers to the stage, making for a challenging and fun learning experience.\n\nMerrin Packer, who plays the musician Ruth, said the play, \u201cis about females loving their bodies where they\u2019re at, women supporting women, about validating women\u2019s experiences and their bodies showing that experience.\n\n\u201cGoing into these characters, none of us were very comfortable, but by opening night, we will be,\u201d she said.\n\nTara Dupont, who plays the outgoing character Chris, said that in the past, \u201cI never felt that I fit the mold of what a woman should be,\u201d but she has come to accept her own unique appearance.\n\nThe play, Dupont said, is about appreciating the body one has, not an abstract ideal. She said that her character comes to realize that \u201cfriendship and the journey are more important than fame and glory.\u201d\n\nDupont said that performing at OTA since auditioning for the first time in 2021 has dramatically increased her confidence level.\n\n\u201cI started appreciating myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to go out and pursue my dreams. I\u2019ve met fantastic people here, made friendships and really grown as a person.\u201d\n\nReal life \u2018Calendar Girl\u2019 and photographer\n\nIn an email, Patricia Stewart of the original \u201cCalendar Girls\u201d wrote about the sequence of events which has led to this moment for OTA\u2019s cast, crew and audiences:\n\n\u201cWhen I had the initial idea for the calendar, it was a joke at a WI [Women\u2019s Institute] meeting a long time before John was ill.\n\n\u201cThe idea came back when John was ill and I thought it would help distract him while he had his treatment. After he died, I thought we should just do it and dedicate it to John\u2019s memory. I did not feel courageous or empowered, but happy that we were doing something positive after such a tragedy and could perhaps raise \u00a35,000 for research into blood related cancers. Everything fell into place like it was meant to happen.\n\n\u201cHowever, the effect was to change the image of the Women\u2019s Institute, alter the perception of the older woman [not that is I considered us to be older women], encourage more charity calendars, raising millions for great causes and giving opportunities to older actresses \u2014 for which they thanked us profusely.\n\n\u201cI think that the actors, either professional or amateur realize our story is about so much more than nudity when they become involved. The calendar seems to have a life and a magic of its own.\u201d\n\nThe character of Chris was based on Stewart.\n\nShe said, \u201cI knew we had to let our story go \u2014 that it was not a documentary \u2014 only about 50 percent of the movie is true. I accepted that I was portrayed as a bit of a megalomaniac!\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t challenge anything, even though I disliked the American advert part \u2014 we have never done anything distasteful in 24 years. We allowed them to make a movie that would work.\u201d\n\nAmong the major differences between real life and the movie/play was the role of the calendar photographer.\n\nThe \u201cprofessional and artistic experience\u201d of Terry Logan, the original photographer \u201cwere indispensable to the success of the projects,\u201d Steward said. \u201cWithout his photos, the calendar would not have been this huge success \u2014 he made it a work of art.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey thought that my background was not very believable,\u201d Logan wrote in an email. \u201cBefore I retired to my career as an artist here in Yorkshire in the \u201960/\u201970s I was an art director with J.W. Thompson Advertising, in Vancouver, B.C.\u201d\n\nHis experience made him \u201cthe natural choice as a photographer for that \u2018Calendar\u2019 here in Yorkshire,\u201d but Logan said that it was decided that an amateur photographer who worked as a hospital porter was more believable for the movie/play.\n\n\u201cIt shows just how much their appreciation of the quality of the photos and the important part they played in the success of the \u2018Calendar\u2019 was \u2026 because all proceeds were going to Leukaemia Research I had to let it go.\u201d\n\nSaid Logan, \u201cMy wife Lynda [who was Miss July in the Calendar] and I wish everyone involved with the play every success and if we had lived closer we would have loved to attend.\u201d\n\nOlympic Theatre Arts\u2019 \u2018Calendar Girls\u2019\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 2 p.m. Sundays, April 28-May 14\n\nWhere: Olympic Theatre Arts, 414 N.
