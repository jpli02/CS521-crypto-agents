        "title": "Ripple's David Schwartz Mocks Bitcoin Maxis - U.Today",
        "content": "Ripple's chief technology officer (CTO), David Schwartz, recently took to Twitter to mock Bitcoin maximalists in a tongue-in-cheek post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwartz, who is known as the architect behind XRP Ledger, responded to a tweet that challenged users to identify seven out of ten tools shown in pictures, warning people not to click on the link because it was \"just pictures of Bitcoin maximalists.\"\n\nThe joke implies that Bitcoin maximalists are tools themselves, indicating that Schwartz does not take their opinions too seriously.\n\nThis is not the first time Schwartz has made light of ardent Bitcoin supporters.\n\nIn an earlier tweet, he shared the idea of a haunted house filled with Bitcoin maximalists, poking fun at their often dogmatic and unwavering dedication to Bitcoin.\n\nThe humor behind these tweets lies in the ongoing rivalry between supporters of different cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and XRP, Ripple's native digital asset.\n\nBitcoin maximalists, who believe that the bellwether cryptocurrency is the only digital asset with a meaningful future, have long had a beef with XRP and Ripple.\n\nThey are still convinced that XRP is too centralized and that the company behind it, Ripple Labs, has too much control over the cryptocurrency.\n\nMany Bitcoin maximalists believe that the existence of XRP is contrary to the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin."

        "content": "SYNTH ANATOMY uses affiliation & partner programs (big red buttons) to finance a part of the activity. If you use these, you support the website. Thanks!\n\nBehringer Chaos and Surges are new modules clones/replicas of the Mutable Instruments Marbles modulator and Ripples analog filter.\n\nEmilie Gillet of Mutable Instruments is a modern-day Synthesizer pioneer. Her designs are fresh, innovative, and playful. Unfortunately, the developer went out of business last year. Due to the open-source nature of the modules, they remain with us. The open source has also attracted many other companies to copy and throw the modules on the market, even when the original modules were available.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Behringer wanted to get involved in this business. They started with the Brains, a clone of the Mutable Instruments Plaits macro oscillator. However, with the last Brains reloaded update, they have shown they want to develop it further. Better than just copying. Today Behringer showed two more modules from their Mutable \u201cBerification \u201d module lineup: Chaos and Surges.\n\nBehringer Chaos and Surge\n\nChaos is a clone of the Marbles, a very crazy but fully CV-controllable chaos modulator module by Mutable Instruments. It is not known whether Behringer will change anything in the code. So far, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s a straight clone of the original. As with the Brains, the module will be launched in a black finish. For the different modes, there will be colored accents.\n\nEmilie Gillet described it in these words:\n\nMarbles is a source of random gates and voltages, which offers an extensive amount of (voltage) control on all the different flavors of randomness it produces. The module gives the musician many different ways of imposing structure on the random events generated by the module: synchronization to external clocks, control of the repetition or novelty of the generated material, quantization of the voltages, or randomization of gates or voltages generated by traditional sequencers.\n\nThen, Surges is a clone of the Ripples \u201cliquid\u201d analog filter. It\u2019s a bit pity that the design isn\u2019t brought into the stereo field like After Later Audio did in its \u201cPopples\u201d module.\n\nMutable Instruments says about the module:\n\n3 filter modes are available: 2-pole band-pass, 2-pole low-pass, and 4-pole low-pass. Plus self-oscillation and a built-in VCA. . The resonance loudness compensation circuit brings a slight tone coloration reminiscent of the Roland SH/Jupiter filters, with a very round and \u201cliquid\u201d resonance.\n\nFirst Impression\n\nThe two modules will probably be very affordable. I\u2019m sure. The only question is how many Marbles and Ripples clones we still need. I hope Behringer will add other modes to his Chaos module to offer more than the other 50 Marbles Clone. Otherwise, it becomes the Clone Wars.\n\nBehringer Chaos and Surge availability and price TBA.\n\nMore information here: Behringer\n\nAvailable at my partner\n\nEurorack News"

        "title": "Will XRP break $0.70 following SEC Ripple Lawsuit? - Cyprus Mail",
        "content": "In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc, the creators of XRP, alleging that they had sold unregistered securities in the form of XRP tokens.\n\nThe SEC claimed that XRP is a security and should have been registered with the commission before being sold to investors. Ripple Labs disputed the claims, arguing that XRP is a digital currency, not a security.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry has closely watched the case, as it could set a precedent for how other digital assets are classified and regulated by the SEC. The case outcome could also impact the growth and development of DeFi projects, as regulatory clarity is crucial for their adoption and mainstream use.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now?\n\nLegal counsel Stuart Alderoty predicted Judge Torres would issue a ruling on March 31.\n\nJohn Deaton, an advocate for Ripple, recently notified the XRP Army that the verdict might not be issued for another two months. On Twitter, Deaton ranked the potential outcomes of the SEC vs. Ripple litigation from best to worst for the payment company.\n\nEven if the case has not been solved, the increased interest in XRP has slightly boosted its value. However, the XRP price dropped to support at $0.51 earlier today after gaining roughly 21% in the previous week.\n\nConsistent increases in whale holdings for the alternative coin may be interpreted as bullish confirmation that large wallet investors are \u201cbuying the dip.\u201d The whales believe the altcoin\u2019s rebound and the successful culmination of the law case might drive its price to $0.70.\n\nIf Ripple were to win its case with the SEC, this could be accurate, but if it lost, it would lead to secondary sales for altcoin, which would have a devastating effect on XRP holders.\n\nIs it time to pick another DeFi coin?\n\nAs the mystery persists, some people are thinking about switching to more secure cryptocurrencies that have a more steady chance of appreciating in value. For instance, the media and newsletters have been completely taken over by DigiToads, a recently released meme coin with play-to-earn capabilities, featuring some cool NFTs.\n\nIn addition to being utility-rich and offering numerous generous reward chances, the project has successfully passed the audit, has a doxxed team, and has garnered substantial investor confidence. A total of ten price increases will be implemented throughout the presale for this brand-new ERC20 token.\n\nBased on projections made in the whitepaper, the price of TOADS is expected to increase by 450% during the presale. Tokens worth $460,000 were sold in the first few weeks of the presale, proving that many people saw the potential and rushed to fill their bags with TOADS when the price was lowest.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nThe SEC and XRP lawsuit highlights the importance of regulations of DeFi initiatives and the need for regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency industry. The XRP army remains optimistic, but there are still a lot of unknowns that are making people lean toward safer investments.\n\nFor more information on DigiToads visit the website, join the presale or join the community\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"

        "content": "THE collapse of a major building firm and its parent group is having a \u2018ripple effect\u2019 through the Island\u2019s economy, the Housing Minister has said.\n\nDeputy David Warr warned of \u2018collateral damage\u2019 but also praised Andium Homes for taking on some affected sub-contractors.\n\nHe added that he hoped the last of the \u2018dominoes\u2019 had fallen following the failure of Camerons as well as the subsequent insolvency of parent company the Garenne Construction Group.\n\nCamerons, one of Jersey\u2019s biggest construction firms, cited spiralling material and labour costs, strains in the supply chain and problematic contracts as well as the impact of the pandemic and Brexit, as the reasons for folding.\n\nFollowing this collapse, directors determined that Garenne was unable to continue to trade given its financial position.\n\nAccounts shared with businesses owed money by Camerons showed that it had \u00a37.635m of liabilities but only \u00a3163,000 available to pay secured creditors, which include staff, Social Security and the Taxes Office \u2013 and no money to pay unsecured creditors such as sub-contractors.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jersey Construction Council has said the outfall \u2018may be stretching several organisations\u2019 that work in the industry.\n\nDeputy Warr said: \u2018There is so much collateral damage from it, not just the impact on the sub-contractors, but then the sub-contractors\u2019 ability to pay for goods and services so it really does have a ripple effect through the whole economy.\u2019\n\nHowever, he noted that some of the affected sub-contractors had been \u2018picked up\u2019 by social housing provider Andium Homes to enable them to continue being paid \u2018sensibly and promptly\u2019.\n\nThese included some who had already been working under Camerons on Andium\u2019s Cyril Le Marquand Court redevelopment, which will now continue under replacement contracting partner ROK Construction.\n\nAndium chief executive Ian Gallichan said they were \u2018delighted to have been able to ensure continuity of employment for former Camerons\u2019 staff at our Ann Court Development\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018We are also pleased that the final phases of the scheme which will see 85 more homes, a new public open space and a public and residents\u2019 car park is on track to be completed within the next 12 months.\u2019\n\nDeputy Warr said: \u2018Andium have a massive programme to come through so it is positive that we have a States-owned entity that has been able to help keep things moving.\u2019\n\nIn a statement published to its members over the weekend, the Jersey Construction Council said it would shortly be issuing a guidance document with advice and support on operational matters as well as those relating to emotional wellbeing of employees.\n\nIt also said it was planning a \u2018drop-in support day\u2019 event with representatives of different organisations from government, third and private sectors.\n\nInterim chair of the JeCC, Simon Matthews, said: \u2018The JeCC is the voice of the Jersey construction industry. As such, the JeCC are concerned that a series of unexpected events, including the outfall from both the Camerons and Garenne decisions, may be stretching several organisations that work in the industry now and in the future.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018It is vital that organisations in Jersey\u2019s construction industry share and talk openly with the relevant persons about their worries and anxieties as early as possible. By making available and signposting the support that is available to them, they will be able to work with dedicated people to manage and resolve these issues, with the key aim of supporting companies through challenging time.\u2019"

        "title": "Tides Ripple Across Earth's Plasma \u201cDonut\u201d - Eos",
        "content": "Earth is surrounded by an ocean of plasma\u2014an electrically charged \u201cfourth state\u201d of matter\u2014and researchers have discovered tides rippling across its surface. The shifting field of plasma surrounding the planet may affect Earth\u2019s radiation belts, which can damage spacecraft or astronauts in orbit or traveling to or from the Moon. Similar tides could race around planets in other star systems, the researchers suggested.\n\nThe plasmasphere is a donut of cold plasma centered over Earth\u2019s magnetic equator within the magnetosphere\u00ad\u2014the region encompassing our planet\u2019s magnetic field. The plasma is supplied by the ionosphere, the electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere.\n\nThe outer boundary of the plasmasphere\u2014known as the plasmapause\u2014is typically found 20,000\u201338,000 kilometers from Earth\u2019s center at the magnetic equator, although its location can vary with the seasons, solar activity, and other factors, Quanqi Shi and Chao Xiao, physicists at China\u2019s Shandong University and the study\u2019s lead authors, wrote in an email.\n\nThis artist\u2019s rendering depicts NASA\u2019s twin Van Allen Probes, which looped through the plasmapause many times, in Earth orbit. Credit: JHU/APL, NASA\n\nPlasma Tides\n\n\u201cWhether lunar tides can influence the plasma-dominated regions had not yet been explored.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past, lunar tides were mainly found to affect the first three states [of matter]: solid Earth tides, liquid ocean, and neutral gas\u2013dominated atmospheric tides,\u201d Shi and Xiao wrote. \u201cWhether lunar tides can influence the plasma-dominated regions had not yet been explored.\u201d\n\nTo fill in that gap, Shi and Xiao and their colleagues combed through a database of more than 50,000 plasmapause crossings recorded from 1977 through 2015 by NASA\u2019s twin Van Allen Probes, the five-spacecraft THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) mission, Europe\u2019s four-spacecraft Cluster mission, and others.\n\nBecause solar flares and related phenomena can cause substantial changes in the plasmasphere, the researchers eliminated readings taken when the Sun was active, leaving almost 36,000 observations.\n\nTheir analysis revealed tides in the plasmapause that ranged from about 0.12 times Earth\u2019s radius (300 kilometers) above average at high tide to 0.14 times Earth\u2019s radius (350 kilometers) below average at low tide\u2014a difference of just 3% in the \u201csmoothness\u201d of the plasmapause. The researchers published their findings in Nature Physics.\n\nSurprising Offset\n\nIn this artist\u2019s concept of NASA\u2019s THEMIS mission, the five probes spread out to study storms in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Credit: NASA\n\nOcean and land tides are highest and lowest close to new and full Moon, when the Moon aligns with Earth and the Sun, and lunar and solar gravity pull along the same line. Unlike those tides, however, the plasma tides are offset from the Moon\u2019s position in the sky by 90\u00b0.\n\nHigh plasmapause tide occurs when the Moon is at first quarter, and low tide occurs 2 weeks later, at last quarter. The tidal waves in the plasmasphere occur once per day and once per month, versus the twice-per-day and twice-per-month cycles for ocean and other tides.\n\nIt is reasonable that the Moon has a small but noticeable effect on the plasmasphere, said Jerry Goldstein, a space physicist at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio who studies the plasmasphere but was not involved in this project. \u201cThe most surprising thing is that the largest effect is 90\u00b0 away from the lunar direction. Intuitively, one might expect the largest effect to line up with the Moon.\u201d\n\nThe plasmapause tide itself is caused by the Moon\u2019s gravitational pull, according to the researchers, but the 90\u00b0 offset is more difficult to explain. It doesn\u2019t vary with the lunar phase, the Earth-Moon distance, changes in seasons, or any other known factors. That means it\u2019s not caused by gravity alone, but by gravity and electromagnetic forces working together, the researchers said.\n\nOne possibility is that electrically neutral winds in the ionosphere, which vary with the Moon\u2019s phase, modify electric currents that thread along magnetic field lines through the ionosphere and into the plasmasphere. The currents might disturb the magnetic field, pulling the plasmasphere out of sync with the motions of the Moon. The researchers noted that this mechanism is poorly understood, however, and \u201cis a subject of ongoing research.\u201d\n\nThe plasma tides \u201cmay indicate a fundamental interaction mechanism in the Earth-Moon system that has not been previously considered,\u201d Shi and Xiao wrote in their email. \u201cThat is to say, lunar tides may not be ignored in the study of the magnetosphere.\u201d\n\nDiving into Plasma Physics\n\nThe tides in the plasmasphere could have implications for space travel and studies of other planets in our solar system and beyond.\n\nMagnetospheres have been detected at other planets, the study\u2019s authors noted, suggesting that plasma tides \u201cmay be observed universally throughout the cosmos,\u201d opening new avenues of research into planetary systems and other bodies with strong magnetic fields.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding this new result is going to require a fun dive into some basic space plasma physics.\u201d\n\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field plays an important role in spaceflight as well. It deflects cosmic rays and particles of the solar wind, offering some protection to craft within the magnetosphere. However, it funnels other particles toward Earth\u2019s surface or traps them in the radiation belts, potentially threatening spacecraft and astronauts, particularly when they travel to the Moon, outside the protection of the magnetic field.\n\n\u201cWe suspect that the observed plasma tide may subtly affect the distribution of energetic radiation belt particles, which are a well-known hazard to space-based infrastructure and human activities in space,\u201d the authors noted. \u201cIt is therefore worthwhile to look for evidence of this effect in future studies.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstanding this new result is going to require a fun dive into some basic space plasma physics,\u201d Goldstein said.\n\n\u2014Damond Benningfield, Science Writer\n\nCitation: Benningfield, D.
