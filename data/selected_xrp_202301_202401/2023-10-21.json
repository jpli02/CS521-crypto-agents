        "title": "XRP Lawsuit: Ripple Holds a \u201cRoyal Flush\u201d in SEC Lawsuit, Ready to Dictate Settlement Terms - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nAs the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit takes dramatic turns, Wall Street veteran and financial analyst Linda P. Jones declares that Ripple isn\u2019t just on the table for negotiation\u2014they\u2019re defining the terms of it. This assertion comes after a series of favourable rulings for Ripple and echoes the speculations within the crypto community that the case is heading towards a settlement.\n\nI agree, however I think Ripple has a royal flush, meaning they aren\u2019t negotiating and can literally name their terms. Due to exposure of the Hinman emails, the SEC has zero bargaining power. Ripple can 100% name their terms in the \u201csettlement.\u201d https://t.co/56mPtob0AZ \u2014 Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) October 20, 2023\n\nLinda P. Jones weighed into the discussion, emphasizing that Ripple\u2019s recent legal victory amounted to a \u201croyal flush.\u201d According to Jones, Ripple is not just negotiating with the SEC but is in a position where they can unilaterally define the terms of a potential settlement. This perspective arises in part due to the SEC\u2019s voluntary withdrawal of charges against Ripple executives Bradley Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, dramatically changing the power dynamics.\n\nThe Hinman Docs: Ripple\u2019s Secret Weapon\n\nJones attributes Ripple\u2019s newly acquired bargaining power to the public exposure of the Hinman docs\u2014drafts of William Hinman\u2019s 2018 speech declaring BTC and ETH as non-securities. This revelation seems to have left the SEC at a severe disadvantage, stripping it of any bargaining power it might have had.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case against Ripple has been filled with setbacks. The regulatory body had to surrender the Hinman documents, faced denial for an interlocutory appeal, and most recently, voluntarily dropped charges against Ripple\u2019s leading executives. These developments have solidified Ripple\u2019s position, aligning with Jones\u2019 sentiment that Ripple can dictate how this saga concludes.\n\nSEC has now 2 options\n\nAs it stands, the SEC is left with two routes\u2014either to appeal the case to the Second Circuit or agree on a settlement. According to Jones, and supported by the legal community at large, the chances of the SEC choosing the latter have exponentially increased.\n\nJones\u2019 insights not only underline the shifts within the SEC v. Ripple case but also imply greater ramifications for the broader crypto ecosystem. A Ripple victory or a settlement on their terms could set legal precedents that benefit the cryptocurrency landscape as a whole, offering more defined regulatory clarity."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its aiding and abetting charges against Ripple\u2019s top executives.\n\nIn a letter to Judge Analisa Torres, the SEC notified the court that it is dropping its charges against Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen.\n\nThe charges were related to the SEC\u2019s original lawsuit from 2020 that alleged Ripple issued XRP, the native asset of the XRP ledger, as an unregistered security. In July, the courts decided that the firm\u2019s programmable sales of the asset were not securities transactions.\n\nIn a new press release from Ripple, the company describes the SEC\u2019s move as a \u201cstunning capitulation\u201d by the US government.\n\nSays Garlinghouse,\n\n\u201cFor nearly three years, Chris and I have been the subject of baseless allegations from a rogue regulator with a political agenda\u2026 Instead of looking for the criminals stealing customer funds on offshore exchanges that were courting political favor, the SEC went after the good guys \u2013 along with our entire company of innovators and entrepreneurs \u2013 who are building a regulated business based in the US. We look forward to the day this chapter is closed once and for all, now that the SEC has dropped the curtain on their absurd theatrics against Chris and me.\u201d\n\nRipple says that due to the regulatory confusion that the SEC has created in its \u201cmisguided quest for power,\u201d crypto innovation is being pushed out of the US, and 90% of the company\u2019s business is now outside of the US.\n\nMeanwhile, Larsen says that the SEC\u2019s decision to drop its charges against the executives helped legally vindicate them against the regulator\u2019s political agenda to \u201csuffocate crypto in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a travesty that we were forced to defend ourselves from an ill-advised attack that was flawed from the day it was filed. While justice ultimately prevailed, the government\u2019s actions that led to this point raise questions about the origin and motivation of this lawsuit. It is an abuse by the administrative state that politically connected special interests, with clear and proven conflicts of interest, were able to drag our names through the mud in an attempt to ruin us personally and destroy a company so many have worked so hard, for so long to build.\u201d\n\nXRP rose 7% following the news and is trading at $0.52 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIn its public litigation against Ripple, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adjusted its strategy. The SEC dismissed the pending criminal charges against the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen.\n\nHowever, this action only means that the case will be delayed. The case is far from being over. The SEC continues to oppose Ripple\u2019s claimed transgression of selling XRP to institutions directly.\n\nSEC Delays Appeal Against Ripple\n\nFox Business contributor Eleanor Terrett brought attention to a crucial element of the current legal drama. She highlighted that the SEC has recently postponed its appeal in the Ripple case, indicating a potential shift in their approach. This development raises questions about the SEC\u2019s future actions and whether they may consider alternative resolutions to address Ripple\u2019s alleged violations.\n\nTerret points out that the SEC is not prepared to challenge the decision. The procedural standard that requires waiting for a verdict explains why. Notably, this verdict won\u2019t likely be rendered until the punishment phase is over, which might take many months. Any plans for an appeal will thus probably be put on wait until the following year.\n\nTerrett also clarified that dropping charges against certain executives does not mean the issue has been resolved entirely. The SEC\u2019s revised legal strategy shows a sophisticated approach that places more emphasis on business operations than its leaders\u2019 behavior. This change emphasizes how difficult it will be and how long it will take to reach a legal conclusion.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Lawsuit: Ripple Holds a \u201cRoyal Flush\u201d in SEC Lawsuit, Ready to Dictate Settlement Terms\n\nPotential Future of the SEC vs. Ripple Case\n\nRipple has gained a tactical advantage against the SEC in this lawsuit. The most noteworthy judgment was made by Judge Torres in July, who sided with Ripple and determined that selling XRP to private investors through exchanges was not illegal under federal securities laws.\n\nThe court rebutted this by citing a breach in the company\u2019s direct sales to institutional investors. This ruling has created a significant shift in the case, highlighting the complexity of determining the legality of XRP sales.\n\nHowever, it remains uncertain how long it will take for a final legal conclusion and whether Ripple and the SEC will consider a potential settlement to resolve the matter.\n\nUnhappy with the partial loss, the SEC plans to appeal the court\u2019s ruling that XRP is not a security. Both sides also keep up complex legal negotiations, sorting through specifics and looking for potential grounds for resolution.\n\nThe recent victory for Ripple, which spared its senior executives from a court trial, points to a tipping point in the law. This victory for Ripple could set a precedent for other cryptocurrencies facing similar legal battles. It highlights the need for clearer regulations and guidelines in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency industry.\n\nLegal expert Fred Rispoli said these events might lead to a settlement. Talks between Ripple and the SEC will likely get more heated as the legal battle moves into the remedy briefing stage. Both parties are probably more likely to reach a mutually satisfactory conclusion than to engage in more litigation. As the case develops, this possibility seems more likely, which has consequences for the overall regulatory environment around cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Ripple (XRP) price continues to surge following the major market trend, which has suddenly flipped bullish. XRP, in particular, has a better reason to rally after the US SEC agreed to drop the suit against Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen.\n\nRead more: Breaking: XRP price jumps almost 10% as SEC drops lawsuit against Ripple executives\n\nRipple FAQs What is Ripple? Ripple is a payments company that specializes in cross-border remittance. The company does this by leveraging blockchain technology. RippleNet is a network used for payments transfer created by Ripple Labs Inc. and is open to financial institutions worldwide. The company also leverages the XRP token. What is XRP? XRP is the native token of the decentralized blockchain XRPLedger. The token is used by Ripple Labs to facilitate transactions on the XRPLedger, helping financial institutions transfer value in a borderless manner. XRP therefore facilitates trustless and instant payments on the XRPLedger chain, helping financial firms save on the cost of transacting worldwide. What is XRPL? XRPLedger is based on a distributed ledger technology and the blockchain using XRP to power transactions. The ledger is different from other blockchains as it has a built-in inflammatory protocol that helps fight spam and distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks. The XRPL is maintained by a peer-to-peer network known as the global XRP Ledger community. What blockchain technology does XRP use? XRP uses the interledger standard. This is a blockchain protocol that aids payments across different networks. For instance, XRP\u2019s blockchain can connect the ledgers of two or more banks. This effectively removes intermediaries and the need for centralization in the system. XRP acts as the native token of the XRPLedger blockchain engineered by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto and David Schwartz.\n\nSEC calls it quits\n\nOn July 13, the US Securities and Exchange Commission scored a major defeat against Ripple in its lawsuit. This major development caused a massive rally in XRP price that pushed it up by nearly 100% to $0.938.\n\nWhile this lawsuit\u2019s decision was a historic win not just for the Ripple and XRP community but for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. But as of October 19, the commission has decided to end the cases against Ripple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen.\n\nWhile these are two victories in Ripple\u2019s corner, the SEC is still likely to pursue the main SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, which claims XRP sales to institutions were unauthorized distribution of securities. But the recent filing states that,\n\nThe SEC and Ripple intend to meet and confer on a potential briefing schedule with respect to the pending issue in the case \u2013 what remedies are proper against Ripple for its Section 5 violations with respect to its Institutional Sales of XRP.\u201d\n\nIf this meet does go in favor of Ripple, it would be a major fundamental boost to XRP and could even catalyze a rally.\n\nRipple price could blast higher\n\nWith the fundamental aspects in mind, the Ripple (XRP) price currently stands at $0.512. Judging from the past, XRP price has always formed an inverse head-and-shoulder pattern before a massive volatile move to the upside.\n\nIn its 10-year history, ALL major, mind-melting $XRP moves had this pattern pop up before it.\n\n...\n\nNow, a similar setup can be seen on the 3-day chart.#XRPArmy #XRPCommunity https://t.co/ATsc5UjXag pic.twitter.com/KWOfXLwDb9 \u2014 MAXPAIN (@Mangyek0) August 16, 2023\n\nRead more: XRP Price Prediction: SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit\u2019s 100% rally could be just the start\n\nCurrently, on the weekly time frame, Ripple price is once again setting up a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. This technical formation has three distinctive swing lows, with the central one deeper than the other two, known as the head. The ones on either side of the head are termed shoulders. Connecting the peaks between the valleys using a trend line shows a declining resistance level, in this case, known as the neckline.\n\nA decisive breakout or a flip of the neckline into a support floor will confirm the start of an uptrend. In such a case, the target is obtained by measuring the distance between the right shoulder\u2019s peak and the head\u2019s lowest point. Adding this value to the breakout point reveals the target.\n\nFor Ripple price, however, things are different. The right shoulder is yet to form, hence, the inverse head-and-shoulders setup is not yet confirmed. For confirmation, the XRP price needs to rally nearly 50% from the current position and retest the neckline. Assuming the remittance token ends its consolidation and kickstarts\n\nAfter the 50%, if Ripple price produces a decisive breakout above the neckline, the measurement rule suggests that a 60% rally to $1.234 is on the cards.\n\nIn total, this move would constitute a 140% rally from the current position of $0.513.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the ongoing Ripple price consolidation breaks below the $0.413 support level, it would invalidate the inverse head-and-shoulders setup. This move will distort the technical formation\u2019s measurements as it could easily trigger a correction in XRP price to the $0.333 level, which is close to the head\u2019s lowest point."

        "title": "Ripple Victory in SEC Lawsuit: 4 Tailwinds and 3 Headwinds for XRP price - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ripple (XRP) is the 5th largest crypto by market cap behind BTC, ETH, USDT, and BNB. In mid-October 2023, Ripple had a market capitalization of $26.6 billion.\n\nXRP price began to rally again in mid-October after six months of hardly moving (other than a July spike that lasted about a few weeks).\n\nHere are six major XRP price factors moving forward:\n\n1. Tailwind: SEC Drops Charges Against Ripple Executives\n\nRipple tokens jumped to 6% gains on the 7-day window Thursday after markets welcomed news of an SEC retreat on two key parts of its Ripple lawsuit.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said in court papers it is dropping all claims against two key Ripple executives.\n\nThat will spare both executives a jury trial. The dropped charges leave the case down to negotiating over penalties to Ripple Labs, the SEC said in its filing.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported:\n\n\u201cThe dismissal of civil claims against Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, who were sued for assisting Ripple Labs\u2019s sales, will likely encourage wealthy crypto defendants to fight regulators in court.\u201d\n\nLarsen and Garlinghouse have been vociferous critics of the SEC over its lawsuit against Ripple. According to Reuters, Garlinghouse said:\n\n\u201cInstead of looking for the criminals stealing customer funds on offshore exchanges that were courting political favor, the SEC went after the good guys.\u201d\n\nThe statement seemed to reference FTX exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently standing trial for criminal charges related to FTX and Alameda Research.\n\n2. Headwind: Ongoing SEC Lawsuit Depresses XRP Price\n\nXRP price made market waves in July after a US judge ruled against the SEC that Ripple tokens are not securities. But that victory was short-lived. In October, the XRP price is back down to where it was 6 months ago.\n\nThat could happen again after this month\u2019s victories for Ripple if the SEC keeps slow-walking its lawsuit and dragging on the uncertainty about Ripple\u2019s future.\n\nBefore the SEC dropped charges against Larsen and Garlinghouse, TheStreet recently reported that Ripple has been one of crypto\u2019s worst-performing assets in October:\n\n\u201cThe subdued performance of Ripple in mid-October now makes the crypto among the most poorly-performing tokens on the crypto market, wiping any gains it previously made.\u201d\n\nRipple (and Binance) are easy targets for the SEC because they are not as decentralized as Bitcoin and Ethereum and have a more corporate structure. The longer the SEC fight drags on, the more tepid the waters for investors.\n\n3. Tailwind: Ripple Investors Hope SEC Will Settle Soon\n\nWhile the looming question of XRP\u2019s regulatory status is holding back some investors, others are holding Ripple in hopes they\u2019ll be in the money when this finally settles.\n\nIt is possible the SEC will wave the white flag once and for all very soon after all the setbacks to its case this year. Perhaps it\u2019s even a likelihood. At least the SEC may be more ready to go ahead and settle with Ripple Lab. If and when that does happen, it will undoubtedly send XRP price surging again.\n\nAfter the SEC backed down from taking the two top Ripple Labs execs to trial, the XRP price jumped from $0.49 to $0.53 on October 19. So, a final resolution to all of the SEC\u2019s actions against Ripple will almost certainly bring the bulls back for another rally.\n\nGiven the duration and cost of the legal battles Ripple has had to fight against the SEC, there could even be a prolonged bull market for XRP to satisfy years of pent-up demand.\n\nWith a decisive outcome to the SEC\u2019s game of cat-and-mouse, the subsequent rally would be apt to sustain longer than the July bull run.\n\n4. Headwind: Intense Competition from Bitcoin, DeFi\n\nFighting for market share with a number of strategic competitors is an ongoing headwind for Ripple. In Q4 2023, the battle for crypto investors\u2019 capital is heating up.\n\nBased on the amount of funds raised for blockchain startups in Q3, the capital community markedly favors DeFi projects over more centralized finance blockchains like Ripple.\n\nThis DeFi vs. CeFi narrative could be an ongoing headache for cryptocurrency investors hanging their hats on the XRP price. (More on fundraising and Ripple in price factor #7 below.)\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance or market share of 51% in the crypto industry is at a 31-month high.\n\nMore than a year of headline news favoring Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network in both industry-focused and mainstream outlets is a headwind for CeFi companies like Ripple and Binance.\n\n5. Tailwind: Positive Market Signals for XRP Price\n\nWhile XRP price traded down some 3% for the 6-month period ending just before this week\u2019s SEC retreat, trading on crypto exchanges had already begun to break upward.\n\nBefore the latest victory in the SEC lawsuit, XRP had just recently gained 2.6% in average crypto exchange prices over a 5-day window.\n\nThat put Ripple\u2019s price a notch above even for the previous 30 days. Moreover, the accumulation of Ripple whale addresses portends a possible recovery in the near future.\n\n6. Headwind: Ripple Labs Gluts Bitstamp with XRP\n\nDespite the good news and strong technical signals for Ripple this week, a whale-sized chunk of XRP tokens recently sent to Bitstamp could overload the market with supplies.\n\nRipple Labs sent over 30 million XRP to the crypto exchange earlier this month. That could over-stuff the market with XRP supply and cause a headwind for the Ripple price if the company intends to sell it.\n\nIt could be possible that Ripple is getting ready to sell those XRP tokens for cash to pay any fines incurred in a ruling or settlement with the SEC.\n\n7. Tailwind: Possible Ripple IPO in The Works\n\nRipple Labs could be going public with an IPO and become a Wall Street traded company. That would bring renewed interest, fresh capital and business alliances, and a ton of earned media attention.\n\nWhile there has been little in the way of official validation for them, rumors of a Ripple IPO are all over crypto Twitter (X.com) this week. That would bring in a potentially enormous amount of institutional and mainstream capital and greatly expand the Ripple ecosystem\u2019s overall balance sheet."
