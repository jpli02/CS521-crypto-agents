        "content": "A fake business registration for a BlackRock XRP trust fueled a market surge and subsequent fall.\n\nThe registration, still available on the website for Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations, mirrors past legitimate registrations by the asset management giant. It names BlackRock Advisors and Daniel Schweiger as registered agents.\n\nBlackRock representatives have reportedly said that the filing is false, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\n\u201cConfirmed by BlackRock by me. Some whacko must have added using BlackRock executive name etc. Cmon man,\u201d Balchunas wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nRipple (XRP\u2019s) price soared as much as 10% on the news before falling. In the wake of the denial, the price fell back to its pre-news level, around $0.65.\n\nThe news seemed to suggest that BlackRock was adding to its slate of crypto-related entities, which includes last week\u2019s registration of an Ethereum trust.\n\nThe false news also comes on the heels of a similar incident, in which a fake headline about a BlackRock bitcoin ETF approval briefly spurred a market rally. To date, no spot bitcoin ETF has been approved.\n\nStill, the moment spurred BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to comment on the \u201cpent-up interest in crypto\u201d in comments to the media in the wake of the false report.\n\n\u201cSome of this rally is way beyond the rumor, I think the rally today is about a flight to quality with all the\u2026issues around the Israeli war now [and] global terrorism,\u201d Fink said at the time.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, has been witnessing an upward price surge and market sentiment.\n\nSo far this month, XRP has risen by over 37%. Analysts are now predicting further increases for the asset in the near term, buoyed by positive developments, including its legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nAnalysts are observing a positive trajectory for XRP, aligning with the broader crypto market trends. The token is aiming to breach the $1 mark in its pursuit of a new all-time high.\n\nAccording to ProSignalsFx, a crypto analyst on TradingView, XRP is currently trading in an uptrend along a rising support line, setting the stage for a potential further upward move. This anticipation rests on the token\u2019s ability to retest the support line, crucial for sustaining the bullish trend.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP Ledger is on the brink of a significant upgrade, backed by an overwhelming 80% consensus among validators. This update aims to address obscured order books and enhance the overall functionality of XRPL. Users with the older Ripple software, like v1.11.0, have been directed to update their system.\n\nYou might also like: Significant whale movements stir up XRP and Bitcoin market\n\nSupreme Court showdown looms\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, recently announced Ripple\u2019s intent to escalate its case against the SEC to the Supreme Court. Garlinghouse revealed that his firm had been offered an out-of-court settlement, which was subsequently withdrawn, a move he perceives as biased. This withdrawal signifies Ripple\u2019s perceived upper hand in the ongoing legal dispute over XRP\u2019s classification as a security.\n\nGarlinghouse\u2019s stance reflects a belief that Ripple has a strong position, asserting that the SEC should contribute to the resolution rather than antagonize the process.\n\nYou might also like: Ripple CEO gets ready for XRP fight in Supreme Court\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nPresently, XRP is valued at $0.654, representing an over 35% price surge in the last 30 days, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nXRP price | Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe cryptocurrency holds a market cap of over $35 billion with a circulating supply of 53 billion XRP. Notably, XRP\u2019s future prospects are interlinked with the wider movements within the crypto market.\n\nXRP is experiencing positive growth, aligning with the general market trend. However, uncertainties persist, primarily surrounding the outcome of the legal battle with the SEC."

Solana (SOL): Marked an 80% increase in two weeks, reaching around $58, with a notable rise in its ecosystem\u2019s total value locked.\n\nBTC\u2019s Turbulence\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently charted impressive gains, triggering fresh hopes that an actual bull run could be on the horizon. It spiked to an 18-month high of almost $38,000 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data) on November 9. However, it quickly retraced below $36,500 in the following hours.\n\nThe ups and downs continued in the remaining days of last week, and currently, BTC is worth approximately $37,000, meaning its price has soared by over 120% since the beginning of the year.\n\nNumerous experts and analysts believe the recent uptrend might be just the beginning of a rally that might take the asset to unseen peaks. Among those were Max Keiser (Chairman of El Salvador-based Bitcoin mining startup Volcano Energy) and Michael Saylor (Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy).\n\nThe former believes BTC could explode to $220K following possible social unrest, while the latter sees BTC trading at over $350K, bolstered by the 2024 halving event.\n\nThose curious to check five additional price forecasts coming from prominent figures could take a look at our dedicated video below:\n\nWhat\u2019s New Around Ripple (XRP)?\n\nRipple and its native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 have also been in the spotlight. A week ago, the coin\u2019s price surged to almost $0.73 (a mark last observed in July 2023) but later descended to its current level of $0.65.\n\nFor its part, Ripple teamed up with mobile payments provider Onafriq to establish payment corridors in multiple African countries, employing blockchain technology for efficient remittances and settlements.\n\nPrior to that, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) approved XRP for use within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) \u2014the leading financial hub in the Middle East. This means licensed cryptocurrency companies and businesses within the DIFC can integrate the asset into their digital asset services.\n\nSolana (SOL) is the Rock Star\n\nThe sixth largest crypto asset by market cap \u2013 Solana (SOL) \u2013 has undoubtedly been among the top trending and discussed coins in the past several weeks due to its massive price surge. Currently, it is hovering around $58 \u2013 an 80% rise for the past 14 days and a whopping 165% jump on a monthly basis.\n\nMoreover, SOL crossed $60 during the weekend for the first time since May 2022. As CryptoPotato reported, the total value locked (TVL) of Solana ecosystem projects has skyrocketed to $465 million \u2014a substantial increase from $300 million in early October."
