        "content": "Cyrusher, a Chinese manufacturer of e-bikes, has branched out into electric-powered snowboards.\n\nThe category's inaugural Ripple model features a 3000W motor driving a fat tire that sits in a cutout in the tail, mounted to twin shocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe depth of the tire's penetration through the board is adjustable, to accommodate for snow conditions and riders of different weights, up to a maximum of 113kg (250 lbs). The company claims the Ripple can hit 50 km/h (31 mph) and has a maximum range of 20km (12 miles).\n\nThe Ripple's weight is listed as 15kg (33 lbs), but it's not clear if that includes the battery, which the rider must bear in a backpack. The throttle control is wired and handheld.\n\nPrices start at $2,200 for the board (with no bindings) and a battery, and range up to $3,300 for the board, bindings and two batteries. The company says they'll ship by January 1st."

        "content": "Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\n\nU.K. cash use is on the rise\n\nUse of coins and banknotes are on the rise in the U.K. for the first time in more than a decade, according to the British Retail Consortium. The trade association attributed the trend to consumers' efforts to control spending amid rising prices. In its annual survey of payments data completed this year, the BRC found that during 2022, cash use increased to 19% of all transactions, up from 15% in 2021. Card payments accounted for 76% of transactions, down from 83% in 2021 during the same time period. Alternative payments \u2014 including those driven by open banking and buy now/pay later lending, rose from less than 2% to about 5% in 2022 compared with 2021. The average transaction value in the U.K. fell to \u00a322.43 (US$28.19) in 2022, down from \u00a324.49 (US$30.78) a year earlier, as consumers made more numerous, but smaller, purchases, the BRC said. Overall, cards accounted for 85% of all money spent, with debit cards driving 75% of funds spent via cards. Retailers participating in the survey accounted for 35% of the U.K.'s total sales, the BRC said. \u2014Kate Fitzgerald"

Legal Dispute with SEC : Ripple\u2019s ongoing legal dispute with the SEC involves allegations of selling over $1.3 billion in unregistered XRP securities, with significant developments favoring Ripple in 2023.\n\n: Ripple\u2019s ongoing legal dispute with the SEC involves allegations of selling over $1.3 billion in unregistered XRP securities, with significant developments favoring Ripple in 2023. Impactful Upcoming Trial: A decisive trial in April will determine the outcome of Ripple\u2019s conflict with the SEC, potentially influencing the broader cryptocurrency sector.\n\nRipple\u2019s New Home\n\nRipple has been frequently making the headlines throughout the ongoing year thanks to the numerous developments surrounding the blockchain enterprise and its winning court streak against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nMost recently, the company announced the opening of new global headquarters in San Francisco, hinting that it has no intention to leave American soil. The building with the modern office was built in 1927 and recently underwent a remarkable makeover. Back in 2019, it was acquired by two real estate giants \u2013 Invesco Real Estate and TMG Partners \u2013 for $125 million.\n\nDavid Schwartz \u2013 Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer \u2013 shed more detail on the matter, unveiling photos of the new workspace on X (Twitter). Numerous users congratulated the firm for its move, wishing it success in the future.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Ripple would continue running some operations at its former office at 315 Montgomery Street, San Francisco.\n\nThe Approaching Ripple/SEC Trial\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Ripple\u2019s decision to move to new global headquarters comes approximately four months before its grand trial with the US SEC.\n\nThe legal battle between the entities started in December 2020 when the regulator sued the blockchain company for allegedly selling more than $1.3 billion worth of XRP as unregistered securities.\n\nThe clash was heating in the following years, with a peak occurring in mid-July 2023 when US Federal Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales from years ago did not constitute an offer of investment contracts.\n\nThe magistrates later dismissed the SEC\u2019s wish to appeal the decision and cleared CEO \u2013 Brad Garlinghouse \u2013 and Executive Chairman \u2013 Chris Larsen \u2013 of all charges brought by the watchdog.\n\nThe trial in April next year is supposed to determine the outcome of the lengthy conflict. A decisive Ripple victory could positively resonate across the entire cryptocurrency sector, whereas an opposite ruling could have a negative impact."

        "title": "Letting the good times roll at Ripple Cafe - Cambridge Day",
        "content": "Back in the day, Kendall Square had Rebecca\u2019s Cafe and the always reliable Au Bon Pan for healthy grab-and-go sandwiches and soup. Those old friends have departed; in their stead, locally baked Tatte and Flour cafes have popped up with whack-a-mole celerity. More to the hyperlocal concept and homing in on the Kendall Square T stop stretch of Main Street where Rebecca\u2019s and Au Bon Pan had their storefronts, we now have Ripple Caf\u00e9 next to the MIT Museum bookstore and Row 34 restaurant. Ripple Caf\u00e9 gets you rolling with breakfast, coffee and lunch and closes at 3 p.m., just as Row 34 opens.\n\nThe menu at Ripple is pretty tight and has a clear Jamaican and Creole flair. For breakfast there are egg sandwiches, a breakfast burger (yup, beef \u2019n\u2019 eggs) and a spicy dejeneur (in the classic French context, a dejeneur is a tray of coffee, juice and baked snackables; at Ripple, it\u2019s hot sausage links with peppers and onions). The lunch menu is the fun time. There are two sandwiches, including a tummy-comfort tuna melt.\n\nThe other is a divine turkey club served on lightly toasted sourdough with perfectly crisp bacon, generous globs of gloriously green guacamole and a bit of a bite with the chipotle mayo atop, making for one of the best turkey clubs I\u2019ve had in the recent past. (Bacon note: I recently had a BLT at a well-established eatery I usually much enjoy, but this sandwich was piled high with undercooked, thick slabs of meat \u2013 let the cured pork be a crisp, lean accent, not a fatty room-temp deterrent!)\n\nThere are salads (a Cobb) and rice bowls that bring out Ripple\u2019s Jamaican accents, be it with jerk turkey tips or creole shrimp. Both come with a base of silky black rice, black beans and crisp little leaf lettuce. I particularly enjoyed the shrimp bowl, as the prawns, slathered in a slightly spicy red Creole sauce, were succulent and fresh, with added accents of mango salsa, lightly fried plantains and spicy peppers and jalape\u00f1os that triggered a pleasurable bead of perspiration upon the brow. As you work your way down through the bowl, the ingredients, sauces and natural juices of the proteins, beans and peppers play increasingly well together, making for new flavors as you go.\n\nThe arrival of Ripple in Kendall reminds me some of Dudley Caf\u00e9 opening in Porter Square this year; both have rice bowls, both have motherships across the river in neighboring Dorchester and Roxbury, respectively, and both bring culinary traditions that are not otherwise that easy to find in Camberville. When I asked about the meaning of Ripple name, one of the many happy, helpful folk behind the counter told me it was from the concept of \u201ccreating a positive ripple effect.\u201d Another chimed in, \u201cRipple is not a cafe, it\u2019s a lifestyle,\u201d and as evident from the joy the workers seemed to share, I\u2019d say so. The menu is seemingly infused with the concept; it\u2019s not breakfast or lunch, but \u201cbreakfast vibes\u201d and \u201clunch vibes.\u201d\n\nBeyond its solid coffee menu \u2013 and it is very good java \u2013 and smoothies, Ripple has a case of pastries savory and sweet, as well as Jamaican patties, hearty turnovers stuffed with your choice of meat, chicken or veggies. Ripple\u2019s also a great space to plug in and study, read or write, or have a business lunch.\n\nAlso like Dudley Caf\u00e9, Ripple has order kiosks \u2013 which are great but bring up a point that\u2019s been sticking with me about eateries and their digital presence: If you\u2019re going to have kiosks or online ordering systems, make sure your food is well represented with pictures and descriptions. If you have a website, post a sample menu and show all your eats in the online ordering system. Be complete and informative. Don\u2019t make someone hop all over the Internet to figure out your culinary story. I\u2019m not singling out Ripple, by any means, just taking the space to say this in general. Besides, I prefer going up to that warm happy face sending good vibes.\n\nRipple Cafe, 314 Main St., Kendall Square, Cambridge\n\nTom Meek is a writer living in Cambridge.
