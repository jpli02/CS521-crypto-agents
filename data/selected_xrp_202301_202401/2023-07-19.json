Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhile the crypto market slumped at the start of the week, XRP has defied the broader trend by moving towards reclaiming last week\u2019s yearly high.\n\nOn Monday, Bitcoin broke below $30,000, putting pressure on the rest of the market. Gains across the top 25 cryptocurrencies remained below 5%, with the exception of XRP and Stellar (XLM).\n\nXRP is up 6.2% in the past day, currently changing hands at $0.78, while XLM soared 9.6% overnight, per CoinGecko data.\n\nXRP\u2019s surge came following further developments in the ongoing case between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple, as a judge directed the two parties to agree on dates for a possible settlement conference.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRipple scored a big win on July 13 as the court partially ruled against SEC\u2019s claims that XRP was a security.\n\nXRP is up almost 65% on the week, following the landmark court ruling in Ripple's case against the SEC.\n\nHowever, over the weekend, crypto prices slipped as Bitcoin (BTC) dropped back toward its $30,000 support and Ethereum (ETH) failed to build support above $2,000.\n\nPotential SEC and Ripple settlement conference\n\nOn Monday, judge Analisa Torres, who gave the landmark verdict, referred the case to district magistrate judge Sarah Netburn for general pretrial, according to documents shared by Fox journalist Elanor Terrett.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\ud83d\udea8NEW: Judge Sarah Netburn orders both @Ripple and the @SECGov to agree on 3 mutually convenient dates to schedule a settlement conference, \u201cif they believe it to be productive at this time.\u201d Also recommends scheduling 6-8 weeks beforehand due to the court\u2019s busy schedule. pic.twitter.com/zyU4Ku2OOu \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) July 17, 2023\n\nMagistrate Netburn will address the pretrial motions, discovery disputes, and also preside over settlement conferences and pass recommendations to the judge for a final verdict.\n\nNetburn recommended the two parties hold a settlement conference \u201cif they believe it would be productive at this time.\u201d The news prompted hopes that the risk of an appeal by the securities regulator against the court\u2019s decision might be reduced.\n\nAdditionally, Ripple made recent investments in the artificial intelligence and metaverse sector, giving a boost to its ecosystem and positive sentiment.\n\nRipple Labs participated in a $54 million Series A funding round for metaverse project Futureverse, which integrates the XRP Ledger into its gaming-focused blockchain The Root Network, and supports the use of XRP."

        "content": "Last week, the crypto community celebrated a U.S. federal court case that ruled Ripple\u2019s XRP token does not make up illegal securities sales \u2014 but only in some cases.\n\nThough many celebrated the ruling, it\u2019s not a true win for crypto.\n\nJudge Analisa Torres, who presided over the case, approved the SEC\u2019s motion with regard to institutional sales of Ripple\u2019s XRP token, meaning that the cryptocurrency is a security when used for institutional sales. However, Torres denied the SEC\u2019s motion related to programmatic sales of XRP, among other circumstances, which means she ruled XRP is not a security when sold to the broader public.\n\n\u201cLining up the summary judgment in favor of the SEC next to the summary judgment in favor of Ripple Labs, it is as if two separate law clerks wrote the different sections and the judge never reconciled them,\u201d Benjamin Cole, fellow at the British Blockchain Association and professor at Fordham University\u2019s Gabelli School of Business, told TechCrunch+. \u201cIf this were an assignment turned in by a student, I would dock the grade repeatedly for internal inconsistencies and specious conclusions.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The ruling] underscores the need for regulatory clarity and consistent standards across different types of participants and transactions,\u201d said David Shargel, partner at Bracewell LLP. \u201cThe distinction will continue to fuel questions about the legalities and regulatory frameworks surrounding cryptocurrency sales and distribution.\u201d\n\nAnd it is, indeed, confusing: It\u2019s a security in one context but not the other, which means it backs the SEC\u2019s stance but also goes against it.\n\nAs the dust settles, questions loom: Where does this leave the crypto industry? And what happens to pending cases with the SEC?\n\nThe ruling precedes other lawsuits and enforcement actions and gives some clarity by one of the nation\u2019s most significant courts. But the logic of the decision could have a \u201cmassive impact on the regulatory treatment of digital asset marketplaces in the United States, as it suggests that they are not facilitating securities trading and therefore are not under the purview of the SEC for secondary market trading activity,\u201d said Daniel Stabile, co-chair of Digital Assets Group and an attorney at Winston & Strawn.\n\nThe ruling comes as the SEC ramps up enforcement actions against entities that it believed were violating securities laws in the U.S., filing suits against domestic and international entities in the crypto market, including Coinbase and Binance. \u201cThe timing of the decision is vital,\u201d Stabile said.\n\nThis decision may also encourage other industry participants to \u201cchallenge the classification of their tokens as securities, leading to potential legal battles and appeals,\u201d Shargel said. \u201cAdditionally, the eventual outcome of the Coinbase case against the SEC will also have a significant impact on how cryptocurrencies are regulated and perceived.\u201d\n\nAnd the XRP decision has already affected the crypto market. Prices for XRP spiked to 82 cents after the news, reaching its highest level since April 2022, according to CoinMarketCap data. Crypto exchanges Kraken and Coinbase, which suspended trading of XRP for U.S. customers after the SEC case was released in December 2020, restarted trading for the token.\n\nAt the time of publication, XRP was around 84 cents, up 80% over a seven-day period. The two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap were slightly changed, with bitcoin down less than 1% and ether up about 2% on the week.\n\nBut this market movement isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. \u201cCrypto project insiders now have a green flag to engage in secret sales, insider trading, and a whole bunch of other terrible market manipulative activity that the SEC has been able to tightly rein in over the decades in stock markets,\u201d said Fordham\u2019s Cole. \u201cIf not overturned on appeal, I expect lots of aunts and uncles to lose a lot of money to bad guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that the XRP ruling is specific to its case and should not be seen as a \u201cblanket verdict for all cryptocurrencies,\u201d Shargel said. Bad actors entering the space to benefit from the ruling might face harsh punishments from regulators.\n\nMoving forward, it is \u201ccrucial\u201d for regulators to establish clear guidelines and definitions to address these discrepancies so that all participants could have a \u201clevel playing field,\u201d Shargel added."
