        "title": "Ripple On the Verge of Burning All XRP Held in Escrow Wallets Say Former Ripple Director - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nFormer Ripple Director Matt Hamilton dropped a bombshell, stating that Ripple might have the power to burn all the XRP tokens locked away in its escrow wallets. This revelation injects a fresh dose of complexity into Ripple\u2019s ongoing legal tussle with the SEC.\n\nRipple\u2019s Hidden Power to Burn\n\nHamilton, a former Ripple Principal Developer Advocate, shared his insights on the ongoing litigation. He suggested that Ripple, with its technical prowess, could make its future escrow funds practically untouchable by disabling the master key for the accounts set to receive the escrowed tokens.\n\nThis concept of \u201cburning\u201d XRP introduces a novel dynamic, making the tokens essentially unusable, even to Ripple itself.\n\nLegal Ramifications\n\nThe concept of burning XRP tokens took center stage following the SEC\u2019s request to destroy LBRY Credits (LBC) tokens in a recent lawsuit. This sparked a debate within the XRP community, questioning whether Ripple could be compelled to burn the XRP in its escrow.\n\nMeanwhile, Ripple\u2019s CTO, David Schwartz, entered the discussion, noting that while neither the court nor the SEC may have direct authority, consensus among XRPL validators could enforce such action.\n\nPro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan added insights, emphasizing that a court order wouldn\u2019t automatically bind XRPL validators, requiring a legal hearing for enforcement. This aligns with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse\u2019s prior statement in April 2021, suggesting the consideration of burning XRP tokens in specific scenarios for the benefit of the broader XRP ecosystem.\n\nAs Ripple navigates legal complexities, the potential decision to burn XRP tokens introduces a new dimension to its ongoing saga."

        "title": "Deepfake Video Featuring Ripple CEO Asking For XRP Circulates on YouTube - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "WEB3\n\nIn the video, a fabricated Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse encourages XRP holders to send their tokens to a designated wallet, promising to return double the amount in what appears to be a deceptive giveaway.\n\nA deepfake video has surfaced on YouTube, raising concerns within the crypto community as it depicts a digital imitation of Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, making an unrealistic request to XRP holders. The video encourages users to send their XRP tokens to a specified digital wallet with the promise of receiving double the amount in return \u2013 a tactic commonly used by online scammers.\n\nMembers of Reddit noticed the deepfake video, which shows an AI-generated Garlinghouse and invites viewers to participate in an XRP event. However, the catch is that participants are asked to send their tokens to a \"designated address\" for a supposed giveaway where the character pledges to return double the amount.\n\nReddit commentators first brought attention to this misleading advertisement on YouTube between November 25 and December 3. Despite user flags and reports, the deceptive ad has persisted on the platform. Redditors shared an unlisted link to the deepfake ad on YouTube, cautioning the community to avoid interacting with the video's QR code to prevent potential financial losses.\n\n\u200d\n\nRipple Executive's Prior Warning\n\nThis incident follows a warning from Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, issued on July 14. Following a court ruling in favor of Ripple in its battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Schwartz emphasized that there were no associated airdrops, giveaways, or special offers linked to the judgment. This recent deepfake video mirrors the scam tactics Schwartz cautioned against.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, no stranger to such deepfake scams, had previously highlighted the growing trend of such videos on YouTube. In the past, scammers overlaid new words onto old video footage from Ripple's events, creating deceptive content. Garlinghouse called out YouTube, questioning if the video-hosting service was \"asleep at the wheel again\" and urged users to be vigilant against circulating messages.\n\nIn light of these events, Garlinghouse emphasized that only approved messages from official Ripple accounts could be considered authentic, underscoring the need for caution and verification in the face of potential scams.\n\nDespite clear evidence of the video's fraudulent nature, a Reddit participant revealed that Google refused to remove the deceptive ad. The feedback from Google's Trust and Safety team suggested that the ad did not violate their protocols."

        "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nIllustration of a galaxy disk being disturbed. Credit: Jonathan Bland-Hawthorn and Thorsten Tepper-Garcia/University of Sydney.\n\nA new snapshot of an ancient, far-off galaxy could help scientists understand how it formed and the origins of our own Milky Way. At more than 12 billion years old, BRI 1335-0417 is the oldest and furthest known spiral galaxy in our universe.\n\nLead author Dr. Takafumi Tsukui said the state-of-the-art telescope ALMA allowed them to look at this ancient galaxy in much greater detail.\n\n\"Specifically, we were interested in how gas was moving into and throughout the galaxy,\" Dr. Tsukui said. \"Gas is a key ingredient for forming stars and can give us important clues about how a galaxy is actually fueling its star formation.\"\n\nIn this case, the researchers were able to not only capture the motion of the gas around BRI 1335-0417, but also reveal a seismic wave forming\u2014a first in this type of early galaxy. The study has been published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nThe galaxy's disk, a flattened mass of rotating stars, gas and dust, moves in a way not dissimilar to ripples spreading on a pond after a stone is thrown in.\n\n\"The vertically oscillating motion of the disk is due to an external source, either from new gas streaming into the galaxy or by coming into contact with other smaller galaxies,\" Dr. Tsukui said. \"Both possibilities would bombard the galaxy with new fuel for star formation.\n\n\"Additionally, our study revealed a bar-like structure in the disk. Galactic bars can disrupt gas and transport it towards the galaxy's center. The bar discovered in BRI 1335-0417 is the most distant known structure of this kind. Together, these results show the dynamic growth of a young galaxy.\"\n\nBecause BRI 1335-0417 is so far away, its light takes longer to reach Earth. The images seen through a telescope in the present day are a throwback to the galaxy's early days\u2014when the universe was just 10% of its current age.\n\n\"Early galaxies have been found to form stars at a much faster rate than modern galaxies. This is true for BRI 1335-0417, which, despite having a similar mass to our Milky Way, forms stars at rate a few hundred times faster,\" co-author Associate Professor Emily Wisnioski said.\n\n\"We wanted to understand how gas is supplied to keep up with this rapid rate of star formation.\n\n\"Spiral structures are rare in the early universe, and exactly how they form also remains unknown. This study also gives us crucial information on the most likely scenarios.\n\n\"While it is impossible to observe the galaxy's evolution directly, as our observations only give us a snapshot, computer simulations can help piece the story together.\""
