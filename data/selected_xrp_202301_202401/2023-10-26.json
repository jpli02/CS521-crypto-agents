        "title": "SEC Seeks $770 Million Settlement from Ripple Labs - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "WEB3\n\nThe case is expected to involve a lengthy negotiation process, including a close examination of documents and transactions.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is demanding a substantial $770 million settlement from Ripple Labs. The SEC alleges that Ripple Labs violated Federal Securities Laws concerning its institutional sales of XRP, the company's cryptocurrency.\n\nThe unfolding development was revealed by pro-Ripple legal representative John Deaton during a discussion on CryptoLawUS TV. The situation now points towards an intricate negotiation process that will involve a meticulous examination of numerous documents and transactions before the final penalty fee is determined. Notably, Ripple's prominent figures, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen are expected to contest the fee, potentially potentially stretching the case's timeline into late summer next year.\n\nSpeculation is rife regarding a possible appeal by the SEC, under the leadership of Gary Gensler. This speculation has gained momentum in the wake of Judge Analisa Torres' final verdict and is further fueled by the SEC's refusal to appeal in a similar lawsuit involving Grayscale."

Discounted rates available.\n\nWhile Oregon State Hospital continues to comply with a federal civil rights order, it\u2019s straining other parts of the behavioral health system, according to a court-appointed expert.\n\nDr. Debra Pinals made the observations in her seventh report as an independent expert tasked with helping state health officials meet a 2002 federal court order intended to expedite treatment for people unable to stand trial because of mental illness. She found that the Salem-based psychiatric facility is meeting the order\u2019s seven-day limit to admit defendants deemed unable to \u201caid and assist\u201d in their own defense.\n\nBetween July 20 and Oct. 15, the state hospital admitted 273 of these defendants within seven days, according to Pinals\u2019 report. Another eight defendants weren\u2019t admitted in the timeframe because of \u201clate receipt of orders or delayed transportation decisions by the counties.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a marked improvement from the Spring of 2019, when the wait time averaged 26 days for aid and assist defendants, prompting Disability Rights Oregon to reopen litigation over state hospital admissions. That led to U.S. Judge Michael Mosman issuing a controversial and sweeping order in September 2022 that set timelines for how long aid and assist defendants could be housed at the state hospital.\n\nPinals, a psychiatrist who teaches at the University of Michigan, called the state hospital\u2019s recent compliance with the order a \u201cremarkable achievement.\u201d She praised the state hospital and the Oregon Health Authority for their efforts. However, her report also called out how the logjam at the state hospital is being pushed elsewhere.\n\n\u201cStill, it remains clear from all these efforts that the Aid and Assist system is overwhelming to partners in the process, and this continues to lead to strain across systems,\u201d she wrote.\n\nPinals wrote that there is concern that some aid and assist defendants will be found \u201cnever able\u201d to participate in their defense and will be placed indefinitely into community mental health programs.\n\nThe report also describes multiple long-term programs being developed to ease patients\u2019 transition from the state hospital to community settings. The health authority is slated to select pilot sites for \u201ccommunity navigators\u201d who will help these patients with the transition. It\u2019s also seeking to increase access to substance use disorder treatment in community programs that serve aid and assist patients."

        "content": "Stefan Thomas, the former chief technology officer of Ripple, holds 7,002 bitcoins, currently valued at $244 million, in a hard drive he can no longer access because he misplaced the digital keys.\n\nThe programmer received these bitcoins in 2011 as payment for an educational video he created about bitcoin, only to lose the access code later that same year.\n\nCrypto security specialists at Unciphered have now thrown Thomas a potential lifeline.\n\nThe firm penned an open letter to him on Oct. 25, claiming they have the technical ability to outsmart Thomas\u2019s \u201cIronKey,\u201d the encrypted USB device, and help him gain access to his bitcoin fortune.\n\nYears ago, Thomas misplaced the paper containing his IronKey password, a device that permits only 10 attempts before permanently encrypting its contents.\n\nAfter fruitlessly trying eight of his go-to passwords, he\u2019s down to his last two guesses.\n\nThe drama gained attention in 2021, following a New York Times article detailing how the programmer had just two shots left to reclaim his crypto stash.\n\nUnciphered has claimed it successfully recovered data from an IronKey similar to Thomas\u2019s, also notably accomplishing this feat for digital culture publication Wired.\n\nThey utilized a \u201csecret cracking technique\u201d over months, permitting them more than the standard 10 attempts, Wired reported.\n\nPooling their resources, the company\u2019s founders reportedly assembled a team called Project Everest, comprising roughly 10 members, including staff and external advisors.\n\nNotably, several team members had previously sharpened their skills at the National Security Agency or similar high-profile government entities.\n\nUnciphered is keeping its research methods and the specific technique used to bypass the IronKey\u2019s guess limit under wraps, citing the potential risk associated with exposing such vulnerabilities.\n\nThe firm says this secrecy is necessary since the outdated IronKey models they breached can\u2019t be updated and might still hold sensitive data.\n\nThomas has so far declined Unciphered\u2019s help, per Wired.\n\nBlockworks has reached out to the former Ripple chief technology officer for comment.\n\nHe is said to have already struck a deal with two other cracking teams \u2014 cybersecurity firm Naxo and independent researcher Chris Tarnovsky \u2014 promising them a reward for unlocking the drive.\n\nYet, Naxo\u2019s progress remains uncertain, and Tarnovsky is waiting for some payment from Thomas to continue.\n\nDespite no success so far from the two parties, Thomas appears to be sticking to his original pact, giving the initial teams more leeway before seeking new aid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the current team could decide to subcontract Unciphered if they feel that\u2019s the best option. We\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d Thomas told the outlet.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights SEC is now seeking $770M in penalties, beyond just determining whether XRP is a security.\n\nRipple is negotiating to reduce the penalty, with a chance of success.\n\nCoinbase vs. SEC oral argument on January 17, 2024, could impact Ripple's case.\n\nIn the SEC vs. Ripple case, things have taken an unexpected turn, introducing more uncertainty. And just when we were thinking that all is well!\n\nJohn Deaton, a prominent pro-XRP lawyer and the founder of CryptoLawUS, has revealed new insights into this legal battle. You don\u2019t want to miss this for sure. Read on!\n\nBeyond the Courtroom\n\nAccording to John Deaton, the SEC is \u201cpissed and embarrassed,\u201d it\u2019s now out for what he refers to as \u201c$770M worth of flesh.\u201d It\u2019s not just about determining whether XRP is a security; the SEC wants to make an example out of Ripple.\n\nDeaton reveals that the penalty phase is like a \u201csecond case\u201d involving more depositions, interrogatories, requests for document production, and more.\n\nI believe Ripple will be successful in cutting the $770M figure down drastically. This isn\u2019t a fraud case. The goal is to reach an appropriate fine against Ripple for engaging in transactions that qualified as the sale of unregistered securities, but sold in the context of a new\u2026 \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) October 25, 2023\n\nRead More: What Happened After Ripple\u2019s Historic Win Against the SEC? $10 Million Invested in XRP?\n\nNegotiations are on\n\nRipple is determined to significantly reduce the SEC\u2019s proposed $770 million penalty. They aim to exclude certain transactions and closely examine expenses and costs. Deaton compares this situation to a similar case involving the SEC and LBRY, which saw a substantial reduction in fines.\n\nThis suggests that Ripple may have a strong chance of reducing the hefty penalty.\n\nSignificance of Coinbase vs SEC\n\nJohn Deaton has identified January 17, 2024, as a crucial date in this legal battle. On this day, an oral argument on the Coinbase motion is scheduled. Deaton predicts that if Coinbase succeeds, it may force the SEC to rethink its strategy, potentially opening the door to a settlement with Ripple. If Coinbase loses, hopes for an agreement between Ripple and the SEC could diminish.\n\nDeaton points out the conflicting messages from various federal agencies regarding XRP\u2019s classification. From meetings in 2013 to settlements in 2015, XRP\u2019s status remains unclear. Deaton believes this ambiguity may work in Ripple\u2019s favor as the case unfolds.\n\nIs A Decision Coming Anytime Soon?\n\nLooking ahead, Deaton anticipates that a final judgment from Judge Torres may not arrive before late summer at the earliest. He also cautions that it could be a full year before an appeal is filed in this case. During this extended legal process, Ripple might face substantial legal fees reaching tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAlso Read: SEC vs. Ripple: What to Expect Next in the Remedies Phase?"

        "title": "Ripple Can Now Offer Ripple Payments (ODL) Services in US - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Ripple could be gearing up to offer its Ripple Payments (formerly ODL) services in the United States by leveraging U.S.-based exchange Uphold for XRP sales in the country.\n\nThe host of Digital Assets Daily, a crypto YouTube channel, called attention to this tactic in a recent post. His remarks built on a comment from an XRP community member who hinted that Ripple\u2019s recent partnership with Uphold aimed to solve its dilemma with Ripple Payments sales in the U.S.\n\nExactly Right. XRP sales through @Ripple solved through sales at @UpholdInc following now clarified legal guidelines of \u2018Ripple Payments\u2019 (Formerly ODL) to ensure US capable regulatory clarity to now \u2018Go Live\u2019 in the US Markets! https://t.co/E8393J5AYs \u2014 Digital Assets Daily (@AssetsDaily) October 24, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Ripple-Uphold Partnership\n\nRecall that Ripple recently inked a strategic partnership with Uphold, as The Crypto Basic reported yesterday. According to the announcement, the partnership would see Ripple utilize Uphold\u2019s trading infrastructure, which boasts 30 trading venues, to bolster its cross-border payment service.\n\nThough reports of the partnership triggered moderate excitement in the XRP community, several community members failed to understand the gravity of its implications. The latest comments aim to highlight how pivotal the strategic partnership could be.\n\nRipple Exempts the US in ODL Sales\n\nNotably, the Ripple Payments service (formerly On-Demand Liquidity) is not live in the U.S. despite Ripple offering these services to over 55 countries with a payout network spanning 70 markets.\n\nMeanwhile, following the July 13 judgment on the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, Leonidas, an XRP community figure, asked if the court\u2019s ruling deemed sales involving ODL securities. Recall that the court declared that Ripple\u2019s past XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn response to Leonidas\u2019 question, Ripple\u2019s CTO David Schwartz disclosed that Ripple was still \u201cfiguring it out.\u201d He pointed out that the company does not currently offer ODL sales in the U.S. However, he stressed that, if they wanted to, Ripple could still offer ODL in the U.S., but the XRP would come from another source, not Ripple itself.\n\nA Solution to the Dilemma\n\nThe latest comment from the host of Digital Assets Daily emphasizes that Ripple now seeks to use Uphold as an avenue for ODL sales in the U.S. By using this technique, the company would avoid any potential regulatory action for the U.S.-based ODL sales.\n\nNotably, in ODL (now Ripple Payments), crypto exchanges play a pivotal role. These exchanges purchase XRP and sell the XRP tokens to financial institutions that use the ODL service. These financial institutions then leverage the XRP as a bridge currency to convert one fiat currency to another.\n\nAs a result of the Ripple-Uphold partnership, Uphold will function as one of these exchanges. The platform will provide XRP liquidity for ODL transactions involving institutions in the U.S. These tokens would not be coming from Ripple.\n\nUphold confirmed this in a recent follow-up post to the announcement. An XRP community figure asked if Uphold would use customers\u2019 XRP tokens to provide this liquidity. Uphold currently holds $1.27 billion worth of XRP in its reserves, reflecting customers\u2019 balance.\n\nHi James & thanks! We never leverage customer funds. They're not ours.. We will, however, be using our expertise in sourcing both fiat and crypto (XRP included) on the open market, in order to facilitate the near instantaneous transfer of money across borders via Ripple ODL. \u2014 Uphold (@UpholdInc) October 24, 2023\n\nHowever, in its reply, Uphold emphasized that it would not use its customers\u2019 XRP holdings to provide liquidity. The platform noted that it would purchase XRP and other assets in the open market for facilitating these ODL sales."
