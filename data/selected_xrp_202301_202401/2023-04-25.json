        "content": "Ripple confirms that XRP ODL payments are now available in India.\n\nRipple Labs has confirmed that its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) payment solution is now live in India. The Silicon Valley-based tech company made this known in a recently published document titled \u201cQuick Guide: Streamline Global Treasury Flows.\u201d\n\nIn the document, Ripple pointed out that the payments solution \u201coffers optimized liquidity for cross-border payments-including complex corridors like Brazil, Mexico, India, and Southeast Asia- by virtue of its strong global payments network and ability to use XRP as a neutral bridge for various fiat currencies pairs.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe development is surprising, given that Ripple did not officially announce ODL\u2019s presence in India.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP did not react positively to the news. XRP has been down 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has also plunged 11% in the past week. At press time, XRP is trading at $0.45, according to Coingecko data.\n\nRipple\u2019s operations in India\n\nIt is worth noting that Ripple has been making plans to launch the payment solution in India since 2020. The plan was disclosed by Navin Gupta, Ripple\u2019s Managing Director for South Asia & MENA.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cRipple is keen to introduce the ODL (On Demand Liquidity) solution to the India market to make remittances faster, easier, better, and cheaper through the use of digital assets,\u201d said Gupta.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Ripple has been operating in India since 2017, especially in the Bengaluru and Mumbai cities. As reported earlier, Ripple opened a regional office in the city of Bengaluru.\n\nSince launching in India, several financial institutions, including Yes Bank and Axis Bank, have collaborated with Ripple to utilize the company\u2019s cross-border payment network, RippleNet.\n\nDespite Ripple\u2019s growth in India, it refused to launch ODL, a payment solution that leverages XRP for cross-border settlements, due to the country\u2019s regulatory landscape.\n\nRecall that India\u2019s central bank, in 2018, prohibited banks from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges, a move that stifled crypto trading activities in the country. Two years later, the Supreme Court overturned the decision imposed by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Ripple intensified efforts to roll out the ODL solution in India."

Over the past few months, they\u2019ve announced a number of improvements and new features within their network. Most notably, the adoption of Money Tap by three Japanese banks has been mentioned. And now Ripple is announcing a huge project. It plans a multi-partnership to help billions of people.\n\nIn 2020, Ripple & Rippleworks announced a $10MM USD contribution to @MCSocialVenture to fund a 3-year initiative to expand financial inclusion using blockchain & crypto.\n\n\n\nWe recently spoke with @ScottOnder to uncover what's next for Mercy Corps Ventures. https://t.co/WzmLyCxOZT \u2014 Ripple (@Ripple) April 20, 2023 Through a multi-partnership, Ripple plans to help 3.7 billion unbanked and underbanked people around the world\n\nRipple plans to help 3.7 billion people\n\nRipple is both a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) and a crypto exchange. For this company, financial inclusion is a human right. With this in mind, it wants to help :\n\nPeople who do not have access to banking services,\n\nUnderbanked people around the world.\n\nIn an article published on its website, Ripple reveals precise statistics. 1.7 billion people are unbanked and nearly 2 billion are in the underbanked category. To overcome this situation, Ripple plans to expand its partnerships with innovative fintechs, universities, NGOs, foundations and social entrepreneurs. The goal: to ensure a more stable, sustainable and inclusive economy.\n\nEmbracing crypto and blockchain technology: THE green and economic solution\n\nRipple is one of those companies that is directly fighting the climate crisis. This blockchain-based financial technology company believes that the adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is the best solution to get rid of this crisis. At the same time, it would contribute to the economic improvement.\n\nTherefore, this project, aimed at helping 3.7 billion people, is not out of Ripple\u2019s goal: to enable low-cost and always-on remittances in emerging markets. But the company also wants to contribute to the creation of central bank digital currency platforms for governments willing to improve financial inclusion.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "World economies continue to grapple with the ripple effects of inflation - SeafoodSource",
        "content": "Heading into the second quarter of 2023, inflation remains a concern for all industries worldwide, seafood included, according to Kroll Institute Global Chief Economist Megan Greene.\n\n\u201cInflation is top of mind for many, many businesses. I think there\u2019s a real risk that inflation remains elevated and persistent. I think the probability of that is really high and I think that the impact of that would be pretty high,\u201d Greene, who will deliver the keynote address at the 2023 Seafood Expo Global/ Seafood Processing Global, said in March.\n\nWhile inflation has peaked in some places, such as the U.S., Greene said Europe has yet to reach that point.\n\n\u201cUnlike in the U.S., inflation in Europe is primarily driven by supply-side factors. So, in a way, the European Central Bank [ECB] is stuck having to hike rates even though it can\u2019t actually do much about the biggest drivers of inflation, which are an energy-shock, food prices as well,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, unlike in the U.S., peak inflation isn\u2019t behind us in Europe. Headline peak inflation is because energy costs have come off so much. If you look at core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food costs, you can see that it continues on an upward march.\u201d\n\nIn early March, France, Germany, Spain, and Belgium all reported an acceleration in inflation,\"which was a bad surprise for the ECB,\u201d Greene said.\n\n\u201cIt just goes to show that peak inflation is still ahead of us in the Eurozone,\u201d she said.\n\nWage growth is adding another complex piece to the global inflation puzzle, said Greene, who noted wage growth in the European Union reached 5 percent in 2022 \u2013 \u201cwell above the Eurozone\u2019s historical average of around 2 to 3 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a worry for central bankers to have wage growth so strong because effectively workers can come and say, \u2018Look, we have to pay a lot more for everything, so you need to pay us more,\u2019 and companies will say, \u2018Fine, we\u2019ll pay more, but we\u2019re not going to let that eat into our profits \u2013 we\u2019re going to pass that cost off to the end-user by hiking prices,\u2019\u201d Greene said. \u201cIt ends up being this endless ratchet effect that\u2019s every central banker\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d\n\nOver the past 15 years, Greene said a \u201cglut of savings globally\u201d has been eaten up by the green transition and increases in defense spending.\n\n\u201cHuge amounts of capital are being mobilized, particularly in Europe, but also in the U.S., in order to undergo the green transition, and that will be fundamentally inflationary over the medium-term. In the long-term, I actually think the green transition \u2013 if we ever pull it off \u2013 will be disinflationary. All of these green technologies will see their revenue streams collapse, that\u2019s the idea. We\u2019ve seen it happen with wind power and solar power already, but that\u2019s not going to happen for a very long time. For the next five years, I think the green transition will be pretty inflationary and we\u2019ll whittle down our global glut of savings,\u201d Greene said. \u201cDefense spending is also being ramped up. That\u2019s the case for Europe, given the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAn aging population around the world is one phenomenon serving to offset \u201cthis huge increase in spending,\u201d Greene said.\n\n\u201cIf we have an aging population, people are going to save more so they can pay for retirement. That will offset some of the savings, but net-net, I think ultimately, structurally, inflation is going to be a bit high going forward than what it has been for the past 15 years, which was persistently low,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Asia, the economic situation for China is strained, according to Greene, who pointed out that while the country\u2019s economy is expected to grow by 5.7 to 5.8 percent in 2023, those figures aren\u2019t up to par with pre-pandemic norms.\n\n\u201cAfter the global financial crisis, China\u2019s put the pedal to the metal and stimulus measures and pretty much pulled the rest of the world out of the recession. I don\u2019t think we can actually rely on that this time around,\u201d Greene said. \u201cI think that the expansion will be more measured and more targeted this time.\u201d\n\nGreene also highlighted climate change as a very present global risk.\n\n\u201cFor years, I as an economist would say, \u2018Yes, climate change is a huge risk coming down the pike.\u2019 I don\u2019t see that anymore \u2013 I think is already a risk that we live with. It\u2019s just really hard to forecast when exactly a [climate-related] event will happen and what the implications will be,\u201d she said.\n\nEven though the U.S., Europe, and China are plotting steps towards a green transition, Greene said, \u201cit\u2019s going to take a long time and [no one] is going to hit their net-zero goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at least we\u2019re more serious about it now than we were a year ago,\u201d she said.\n\nJoin Greene on 26 April for her conference presentation, \u201cKeynote: Navigating the Global Polycrisis,\u201d to learn more about how inflation and other challenges are expected to impact global economies in 2023.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Vit-Mar/Shutterstock"

        "title": "Ripple effect of fire-resilient forests | US Forest Service - USDA Forest Service",
        "content": "Jamie Hinrichs\n\nPacific Southwest Region\n\nApril 25, 2023\n\nA now-and-then gaze on Downieville in the North Yuba Landscape. The 1905 photograph shows trees at a healthy spacing on the hillsides, with the town easily viewable below. By comparison, the 2022 photo shows an overgrowth of trees, which would allow fire to spread and grow in intensity in the event of a wildfire. (USDA Forest Service Photos, historic photo from Fire in the Sierra Nevada Forests by George E. Gruell).\n\nFire-resilient forests have a ripple effect \u2014 from trees to landscapes to communities \u2014 as their benefits spread beyond their borders to all of us.\n\nThe 275,000-acre North Yuba Landscape within California\u2019s Tahoe National Forest is one of the largest contiguous unburned areas remaining in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It was selected for the Wildfire Crisis Strategy in 2022 as a high-risk landscape.\n\nThe North Yuba is also home or backyard for several mountain communities, including Downieville \u2014 about 3 square miles with a population of around 250. Like many other small towns within forested lands in the West, Downieville is exposed to significant wildfire risks due to rising temperatures, enduring drought and an overabundance of living and dead trees on the land.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of potential for large scale, high severity fire if something starts during the summer,\u201d said Andrew Mishler, Acting Yuba River District Ranger. \u201cAnd the work planned for this landscape really focuses on reducing the density of vegetation around communities and giving that buffer firefighters need to defend them.\u201d\n\nAt first it is hard to see the need to remove anything. The sea of green seems like a positive thing, a sign the forest is productive and beautiful. But look closer and consider drought years when these trees and shrubs are water stressed and drying. Then the vegetation becomes potential fuel for a fire.\n\nSmoke from the distant 2021 Dixie Fire encases views along Highway 49 which leads to Downieville within the North Yuba Landscape. Although flames were far away, if ignited, this heavily forested landscape is at high risk of creating a similarly smokey sky if the dense vegetation is not reduced. (USDA Forest Service photo by Jamie Hinrichs).\n\nWildfire risks become more visible during a drive to Downieville along a winding highway, hemmed in by heavily forested canyons.\n\nThis highway is the only way in and out of Downieville for residents and the nearly million visitors each year coming to the Tahoe National Forest for recreation. If the hillsides ignited, entrapment becomes a real danger for everyone. Increasing the wildfire resilience of important forest infrastructure, like roads and bridges, by reducing vegetation around them protects locals and anyone traveling to relax on public lands.\n\nFire-resilient forests also benefit the water supply, locally and regionally.\n\n\u201cThe water resources in this landscape are very important to a lot of communities, not just here in the area, but downstream as well,\u201d said Mishler. \u201cIf we lose a lot of this forest cover to fire, we're going to have sediment and debris flowing into those waterways and impacting water quality.\u201d\n\nThe North Yuba Landscape is named for the North Yuba River, which provides drinking water, habitat for sensitive wildlife and recreation along the river.\n\nMap of the North Yuba Landscape (USDA Forest Service map).\n\nBut even if you never visit the North Yuba Landscape or even know its name, protecting this water source from wildfire risks affects us all. The North Yuba River supplies 260,000 acre-feet of water for 60,000 acres of productive farmland as far away as the Sacramento Delta. The Delta provides water to nearly 30 million residents in California and supports agriculture supplying food across the country. So if you live in Maine, but you eat asparagus grown in the Delta, you might be absorbing the wildfire resilience of the North Yuba Landscape despite being thousands of miles away.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Forest Service and a collaborative group of eight partners \u2014 called the North Yuba Partnership \u2014 are working to implement the agency\u2019s Wildfire Crisis Strategy in the North Yuba Landscape. Proposed work includes reducing the number of trees on the landscape with ecological thinning. Strategic tree removal can help reduce wildfire risk to communities, lessen the potential for carbon emissions from a catastrophic fire and promote healthy old-growth forest that will be left. Plus, biomass will either be burned by prescribed fire or used for bioenergy \u2014 to reduce vegetation on the ground and help stop fire from climbing and spreading quickly into the forest canopy.\n\n\u201cBy working together and forming the North Yuba Forest Partnership, we are all able to move more quickly and effectively toward achieving social and environmental resilience,\u201d said Tahoe National Forest Supervisor Eli Ilano. \u201cWith 5 million dead trees across the Tahoe in 2022 alone, the urgency of this work has never been more important.\u201d\n\nRecently, the Tahoe National Forest announced it is providing National Forest Foundation $117 million to implement forest management work in the North Yuba Landscape. This investment is the largest agreement between the two organizations in history and will greatly increase the pace and scale of work being completed on the ground in the landscape.\n\nSimilar work will be happening in landscapes within national forests throughout the country with the announcement of 11 new landscapes. For updates on the work to reduce wildfire risk or for more information on the Forest Service\u2019s national strategy, please visit Confronting the Wildfire Crisis | US Forest Service (usda.gov).\n\n"

        "title": "Forbes questions if Ripple is round-tripping XRP just like Wirecard - Protos",
        "content": "Crypto firm Ripple boasts about the utility of its token, XRP, for cross-border payments. However, a sizeable percentage of XRP transactions seem to round-trip between related entities. As described by Forbes, some of Ripple\u2019s financial practices appear to be misleading, round-tripping schemes.\n\nOn paper, Ripple\u2019s sales volumes look healthy. The company\u2019s top line seems to be increasing. It added new money transmitters in Asia and the Middle East. Ripple even seems confident that it\u2019ll win its lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Executives asked a judge to skip jury trial and rule on the case early, in summary judgment.\n\nMost of this financial confidence comes from one, simple activity: liquidating XRP.\n\nRipple\u2019s most lucrative activity: Selling XRP\n\nThrough various schemes, including opaque loans and transfers between partly-owned entities, Ripple has sold billions of dollars worth of XRP. All three co-founders of Ripple have personally sold over $150 million dollars worth of XRP, not to mention their beneficial equity in Ripple. Two became billionaires.\n\nSelling XRP \u2014 and concocting various financial schemes that resulted in effectively-but-not-literally selling XRP \u2014 was the easy part.\n\nRipple conducted one of the world\u2019s first ICOs, easily accepting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of newfound bitcoin and ether wealth from crypto\u2019s nouveau riche. For those lucky enough to have had bitcoin during the ICO of XRP, buying was as easy as gambling with house money. Bitcoin and ether were rallying by so many percentage points it was hard to place the comma.\n\nThe hard part for Ripple was controlling its media presence while selling. The purpose of Ripple was obvious; its co-founding equity owners had awarded their company four-fifths of the supply of XRP. How, given this obvious largesse, could Ripple distract attention with other diversions?\n\nIts public relations and marketing departments worked over-time. They flooded press channels with stories about peer-to-peer payments, interbank liquidity facilities, remittances, and endlessly varied distractions. It gave XRP tokens and equity away to reciprocating partners who agreed to use XRP, even if it was pointlessly inefficient.\n\nAll the while, Ripple and its co-founders steadily liquidated their XRP.\n\nRead more: SEC v. Ripple summary judgment expected in April\n\nForbes asks if XRP is round-tripping\n\nRound-tripping refers to transactions between companies that make it look like revenue is bigger than it actually is. This accounting trick can effectively \u201cpad the books\u201d to make an income statement look more attractive to investors. It can also inspire confidence among participants in the digital asset industry, which had a bad 2022 after billion-dollar bankruptcies like FTX, Terra Luna, Celsius, and Voyager.\n\nFor context, the Wirecard scandal prominently featured round-tripping, along with falsification of accounts. Some $2 billion on Wirecard\u2019s books never even existed. Wirecard routed money through related companies to make it look like it was getting more business than it actually was.\n\nAfter investigators uncovered its fraud, Wirecard collapsed. The company is in insolvency proceedings.\n\nOnly 8% of Ripple\u2019s Malaysian darling uses XRP \u2014 and most of that 8% is a related party\n\nRipple\u2019s adoption in Asia is a case study in sponsored content. For years, it boasted about partnerships with Moneygram and various subsidiaries of the Japanese mega-conglomerate SBI. Eventually, the world learned that most of these so-called partnerships were financially sponsored by Ripple, with negligible non-sponsored utility of the XRP token.\n\nNowadays, Ripple heralds the adoption of XRP in Malaysia. Mostly, it talks about one company: Tranglo. As unearthed by Forbes, data from that Malaysian payments company indicates that only 8% of its customers are using XRP to settle payments (Ripple regularly neglected to mention this tiny percentage when praising Tranglo\u2019s impressive scale). Forbes further reported that a related party generated most of that 8%.\n\nEven worse, Ripple owns a 40% stake in Tranglo.\n\nRipple provides Tranglo with on-demand liquidity or ODL, which creates short-term loans in XRP that borrowers repay in fiat. ODL is also a scheme, providing a way for Ripple to potentially offload XRP for cash without having to take responsibility for direct sales.\n\ni guess you didnt see the report that came out a few days ago from moneygram where they said they dont see a reason to use xrp then \u2014 sparkes25\u203d(DogeMaximalist) (@aidansparkes) June 3, 2020 Moneygram stopped using XRP after Ripple stopped paying.\n\nRead more: How Ripple\u2019s XRP went from top Ethereum challenger to altcoin also-ran\n\nRipple disputes this take, saying the figures taken from SEC filings are being misrepresented by Forbes, and that Tranglo represents only a small part of its business.\n\nMore privately, Ripple might derive substantial revenue through offloading XRP through its ODL product under the guise of providing liquidity.\n\nThe ODL model of routing XRP through other companies with short-term loans to be repaid in cash sounds somewhat like round-tripping. In any case, it demonstrates how Ripple has been able to swap XRP for cash even if it\u2019s not directly selling on an exchange. With examples ranging from Moneygram to various SBI portfolio companies, Ripple has a long history of subsidizing partnerships to make its business look impressive.\n\nAlthough Ripple shows confidence that its legal defense can prevail against the SEC, it may be less confident in its non-sponsored, non-ODL revenue.\n\nGot a tip?
