        "content": "Ripple Glass, a company of Strategic Materials, Inc., one of North America\u2019s largest glass recyclers, is collaborating with Owens Corning to expand its program to give glass a second life. Ripple Glass will host glass recycling events, swag giveaways and a social media campaign to support the collection program, with bins in their bold purple color.\n\nWith the mantra \u201cGive Glass a Second Life\u2122\u201d, Ripple Glass launched their expansion in Atlanta earlier this year and collects more than 1.6 million pounds of glass each week nationwide.\n\nOwens Corning was the inventor of fiberglass in 1938 and uses recycled glass and other natural ingredients in its PINK Next Gen\u2122 Fiberglas\u2122 insulation batts and rolls. They also feature a variety of insulation products for every application, from attic to basement, and a full line of roofing products.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve launched the first Ripple Glass \u2013 Owens Corning sponsored collection bin at Atlanta\u2019s CHaRM / Live Thrive, a well-respected nonprofit in the area,\u201d said Laura Hennemann, senior vice president, Sustainability & Corporate Affairs, Ripple Glass. \u201cThe bin will continue to move around the metro area for the community to see and we will host a glass recycling pop-up event in the future.\u201d\n\nCHaRM/Live Thrive is located at 1110 Hill St. SE, Atlanta, GA 30315.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to work with Ripple Glass on this exciting recycling effort,\u201d said Eric Miller, marketing leader, Owens Corning \u2013 Home Center. \u201cAtlanta is a great launch point, since our national retail partner, The Home Depot is based here.\u201d\n\nMiller said Owens Corning also operates the Fairburn, Ga., insulation manufacturing facility outside of Atlanta, so there is a direct connection to the glass consumers bring to the bin.\n\nThe market for recycled glass in Georgia is uniquely positioned with strong demand from several leading fiberglass insulation companies operating in the state. The use of recycled glass in the production of new fiberglass insulation offsets the need for virgin, mined material such as sand. Recycled glass also melts at a lower temperature resulting in more responsible manufacturing by lowering energy usage and reducing CO2 emissions. According to Ripple Glass, Georgia residents can recycle a glass bottle with the Ripple Glass program and it\u2019ll be back on a local shelf as an insulation in less than 30 days. Six glass bottles are able to generate enough fiberglass insulation for one standard wall cavity.\n\nFrom a sustainability standpoint, PINK Next Gen Fiberglas insulation uses more than 1 billion pounds of glass recycled each year with the highest recycled content in the industry."

        "content": "U.S. SEC chairman Gary Gensler, notorious for his hurtful actions against blockchain firms, had recognized XRP\u2019s and Ripple\u2019s contributions to facilitating cross-border payments.\n\nGensler endorsed the usefulness of Ripple\u2019s solution in moving payment between two countries during an economic forum on the impact of blockchain technology on finance in 2018.\n\nDuring the interactive session, Jo Marie Griesgraber of the nonprofit \u201cNew Rules for Global Finance\u201d posed a crucial question to the SEC chairman. Separating Bitcoin from blockchain technology, Griesgraber sought clarity on the feasibility of leveraging blockchain for instantaneous, low-cost international remittances through central banks.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nShe highlighted the exorbitant cross-border transmission costs from countries like Tanzania to Nigeria alongside the inefficiencies in the existing system.\n\nIn response, SEC chairman Gensler affirmed that blockchain technology is usable for cost-effective cross-border transactions without Bitcoin. He consented to the significant remittance costs from the movement between different fiat currencies.\n\nFurthermore, Gensler outlined the historical challenges associated with nostro accounts and the intricate account base setup for international transactions. However, he expressed optimism about the potential of blockchain technology to streamline these processes.\n\nHe stated blockchain technologies are alternatives to traditional systems like SWIFT as they can function efficiently without needing a mechanism to bear counterparty risk during cross-border transactions.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nGensler Acknowledging XRP and Ripple\n\nIn this context, Gensler noted that a \u201cbridge currency\u201d [such as XRP] is necessary to facilitate seamless transactions between different fiat currencies. Gensler mentioned utilizing stablecoins backed by major fiat currencies or innovative currencies like XRP.\n\nIn his words:\n\n\u201cYou could use blockchain, but the current thinking is you need a bridge currency in between, and that bridge could be a stable value that\u2019s backed by the US dollar or the EUR, and it could be a currency like \u2026 Ripple has an alternative it\u2019s just piloted in May [2018].\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the experimental stage of Ripple\u2019s pilot in May, he underscored the transformative role a \u201cbridge currency\u201d on the blockchain could play in overcoming the hurdles of international remittances.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the product Gensler referred to that got piloted in May 2018 was xRapid. xRapid used XRP for cross-border liquidity. Notably, xRapid has since been rebranded into Ripple On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), which has also been recently adapted into \u201cRipple Payments.\u201d\n\nGensler Admired XRP and ALGO But Now Calls them Security\n\nWhile the SEC chairman admitted to XRP\u2019s role as a bridge asset in 2018, he tagged XRP as a security in a 2020 lawsuit, which has not ended nearly three years later.\n\nSimilarly, in a 2019 presentation, Gensler recognized Algorand (ALGO) as \u201ca great technology that has a performance with which you could create Uber on top of it.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a lawsuit in April 2023, the SEC chairman categorized ALGO as a security."
