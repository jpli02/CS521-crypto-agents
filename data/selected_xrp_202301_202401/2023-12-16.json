        "title": "Crypto Expert Sets Record Straight, Says XRP Exists Before Ripple; \u201cXRP Not Created for Banks\u201d - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Prominent crypto author Panos Mekras took to X to address the prevailing negative sentiment surrounding XRP within the crypto community.\n\nMekras emphasized that while individuals are entitled to their opinions, facts should remain constant. \u201cYou can have your own opinion but not your own facts,\u201d he noted, opening the discussion.\n\nYou can have your own opinion, but not your own facts.\n\n\u2022 $XRP exists before Ripple and will continue to exist after it.\n\n\u2022 XRP was not created for banks, but to empower individuals and DeFi.\n\n\u2022 XRP is not and can never itself be a security.\n\n\u2022 XRP Ledger is decentralized with\u2026 \u2014 Panos ?{X} (@panosmek) December 15, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nXRP Exists Before Ripple\n\nThe first point the renowned author countered was the frequently misconstrued relationship between XRP and Ripple. In particular, Mekras argued that XRP Ledger with the native token XRP existed before Ripple came into the limelight of the crypto space.\n\nThis view seeks to clarify the independence of XRP and Ripple, as many crypto market participants often falsely state that Ripple is the company behind XRP.\n\nTo emphasize, Ripple is a crypto payment firm based in San Francisco. In contrast, XRP is the native asset of the XRP Ledger blockchain. Additionally, Ripple is one of the thousands of crypto firms utilizing XRPL, and by extension, XRP, for payment solutions.\n\nXRP Not Created for Banks\n\nFurthermore, Mekras underscored the original purpose of XRP, stating: \u201cXRP was not created for banks, but to empower individuals and DeFi.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis assertion aimed to counter the perception that XRP was exclusively designed for institutional use amid Ripple\u2019s use of XRP to facilitate cross-border payment services for institutions.\n\nAs a result, Mekras emphasized XRP\u2019s broader utility in empowering individuals and contributing to decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives.\n\nBesides, Mekras reiterated XRP\u2019s clear regulatory status in the United States. \u201cXRP is not and can never itself be a security,\u201d Mekras proclaimed. This statement aimed to reaffirm XRP\u2019s unique position in the digital asset space.\n\nXRP Ledger Not Centralized\n\nAlso, Mekras stressed the decentralization of the XRP Ledger. Specifically, he remarked: \u201cXRP Ledger is decentralized with hundreds of nodes and projects worldwide,\u201d emphasizing the widespread participation in maintaining the network.\n\nLastly, Mekras touched on the deflationary nature of XRP. He noted that no more than the 100 billion units already in circulation will be created."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Ripple CTO JoelKatz challenges the SEC's definition of \"crypto-asset security\" as too narrow.\n\nSchwartz argues that assets involve not just the physical item, but also legal rights associated with it.\n\nA judge ruled XRP sales don't qualify as securities, while the SEC disagrees.\n\nDavid \u201cJoelKatz\u201d Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, has expressed concerns over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) interpretation of \u201ccrypto-asset security.\u201d This dispute highlights the ongoing tension between the cryptocurrency industry and regulatory bodies.\n\nThis debate seems to have gone on longer than anyone anticipated and it continues to get trickier at every turn. Read on for the latest twist.\n\nBreaking Down the SEC Battle\n\nSchwartz\u2019s main argument revolves around the SEC\u2019s approach in the context of the Wahi lawsuit. He contends that the SEC\u2019s definition of crypto-assets resonates more with tokenized stocks and does not accurately reflect the nature of assets transferred via distributed ledger technologies. He argues that tokens, unlike traditional securities, are not contracts, transactions, or schemes and thus should conform to different legal criteria.\n\nAlso Read: SEC-Ripple Lawsuit Was Much Bigger Than Just XRP, Argues John Deaton\n\nThe Asset Debate\n\nDelving into the semantics of \u201casset,\u201d Schwartz illustrates that the term encompasses more than just the physical item in transactions. He uses the example of selling an apple to demonstrate that the transaction also involves legal rights, challenging SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s broad classification of crypto products as securities. This perspective is part of Ripple\u2019s broader challenge against the SEC\u2019s regulatory stance.\n\nRead More: Why Did Gary Gensler Do a U-Turn on Cryptocurrency?\n\nLegal Battle: Judge Torres and the Howey Test\n\nThe legal landscape is further complicated by a court ruling from Judge Torres, stating that XRP\u2019s programmatic sales do not qualify as securities under the Howey Test. Contradicting this, Gensler maintains that the SEC\u2019s interpretation is valid. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan criticizes the SEC for using vague terms to push its regulatory agenda.\n\nIn the ever-changing world of crypto rules, the Ripple-SEC showdown shows the struggle of fitting new tech into old rules. As this drama unfolds, the crypto crowd is on the edge, waiting to see how it might shake up the whole industry."

There was no settlement, and there will no longer be a trial against the Ripple executives anymore.\n\nThe lawsuit has now entered the remedies stage, in which the Court will decide which, if any, remedies to impose in light of the Court's judgment that certain institutional sales constituted sales of securities.\n\nWhile 2023 was noteworthy for Ripple given its wins in the SEC lawsuit, the company anticipates even more victories in 2024.\n\nAlong these lines, Ripple's Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty has given his bold outlook on policy and crypto regulation for 2024.\n\nAlderoty predicts that in 2024, the last bit of the SEC's misguided lawsuit against Ripple will finally come to an end. He further predicts that after the Ripple lawsuit has ended, the SEC's campaign of regulation by enforcement will continue against other industry leaders.\n\nKey dates in 2024\n\nAccording to the July 13 ruling, the Court determined that: XRP is not a security in and of itself; Ripple's sales of XRP on exchanges or by its executives and a wide range of other Ripple's XRP distributions to developers, charities and employees are not securities.\n\nCertain Ripple sales made under written contracts were considered investment contracts and hence securities. In this regard, the parties recommended a joint briefing schedule on remedies.\n\nFollowing the submission of this joint briefing schedule on Nov. 9, the Court considered the parties' proposal and established crucial dates.\n\nBy Feb. 12, 2024, the parties, both Ripple and the SEC, shall complete remedies-related discovery. The SEC is required to file its brief on remedies by March 13, 2024. By April 12, 2024, the defendant (Ripple) shall file its opposition, and by April 29, 2024, the SEC shall file its reply, if any."

        "title": "Ripple effects: Wildfires reshape aquatic ecosystems - Earth.com",
        "content": "A study from the University of California San Diego has revealed a concerning trend: not only are wildfires wreaking havoc on land, but they\u2019re also transforming aquatic ecosystems in ways that could have far-reaching implications for water quality and fisheries.\n\nThe research, led by Professor Jonathan Shurin of the School of Biological Sciences and his team, is featured in two papers published in the journal Global Change Biology.\n\nGrowing crisis\n\nClimate warming has led to more frequent and severe wildfires globally, and this surge is not just a terrestrial issue.\n\n\u201cThe effects of wildfires are not limited to terrestrial systems,\u201d said study co-author Chris Wall. \u201cWhen we think about wildfires increasing, especially in the West, it\u2019s important to remember that burned materials flow directly into waterways that are vital for people and wildlife.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now recognizing that wildfires can greatly influence ecosystem health, with implications for water resources, like aquifers and recreational fishing.\u201d\n\nAltered aquatic ecosystems\n\nThe research shows that fire chemically alters plant debris, changing the fundamental role of lakes, ponds, and streams in the carbon cycle. This alteration is crucial because aquatic ecosystems are significant carbon sinks, capturing water flows and storing carbon in their sediments.\n\nThe findings indicate a shift in how these systems process and store carbon, with potential consequences for atmospheric CO2 levels.\n\nHow the research was conducted\n\nThe study was conducted over 90 days using experimental pond systems. The researchers explored the effects of burned and unburned plant matter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the impact that these huge fires have had on watersheds, so we\u2019re working in these natural systems to understand how different components of climate change are altering the ecosystems,\u201d said Shurin.\n\nThe team used a novel approach by fertilizing sage plants with nitrogen to track its movement from plants to aquatic species, like plankton.\n\nKey insights\n\n\u201cBy using the nitrogen tracer in plant materials, we found less burned plant-derived nitrogen was being incorporated by zooplankton, indicating that burning reduced the transfer of nitrogen to higher organisms,\u201d said Wall.\n\n\u201cThis agreed with other findings, which showed burned treatments had lower carbon dioxide concentrations, greater oxygenation and higher rates of photosynthesis relative to unburned treatments.\u201d\n\nCarbon dynamics\n\nOne striking revelation was that ponds with burned plant matter emitted less carbon dioxide compared to those with unburned material, suggesting a potential increase in carbon storage.\n\nOn the other hand, this capacity diminished with higher amounts of burned material, leading to greater CO2 emissions.\n\n\u201cBurned plant matter fuels the biological carbon pump of lakes, allowing them to soak up more CO2 from the atmosphere,\u201d said Shurin.\n\n\u201cHowever, this capacity for increased carbon storage was lost as the amount of burned material increased, with treatments receiving the greatest amounts of burned plant material exhibiting highest CO2 export to the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nSpecies composition\n\nThe researchers also observed a transformation in the species composition within these aquatic ecosystems.\n\nPonds with heavy loads of burned material became breeding grounds for insects like mosquitoes, diverging from the typical aquatic inhabitants like zooplankton.\n\n\u201cThese impacts were shifted by fire treatment,\u201d said the researchers. \u201cBurning increased the elemental and organic composition of detritus, with cascading effects on ecosystem function.\u201d\n\nStudy implications\n\nThis research underscores the need for climate change models to incorporate interactions between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.\n\nAs climate change projections forewarn of escalating environmental and economic damages due to wildfires, understanding these aquatic transformations becomes vital for future conservation and management strategies.\n\n\u201cMore frequent and intense wildfire may alter the capacity of aquatic systems to store, transform and exchange carbon with the atmosphere,\u201d wrote the researchers.\n\nThey noted that in the future, forecasts of climate change should include integrative models that account for feedbacks between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in order to fully understand changes to the global carbon cycle.\n\nLike what you read?
