        "content": "BROAD RIPPLE \u2014 A proposed multi-family apartment and townhome development in Broad Ripple has caused controversy between neighbors, and now a lawsuit has been filed to try to stop it from happening.\n\n\"We have literally hundreds of neighbors that are opposed to this project,\" John Kautzman, the lawyer representing one of the neighborhood associations filing suit, said.\n\nElements\n\nThe now-empty Willows Event Center is home to a proposed development that calls for 208 units, comprised of apartments and townhomes.\n\n\"What kind of precedent that a project of this magnitude will set for development in our city if it's allowed to proceed,\" Lindsay Scott, from the Marott Island Community Association, said.\n\nNeighbors say they aren\u2019t happy with proposal.\n\nWRTV\n\n\"There are problems with the height, there's problems with the traffic safety and the pedestrian safety,\" Kautzman said.\n\nThe lawsuit has been filed by two neighborhood associations, and two others who live nearby. It's against Indy\u2019s Metropolitan Development Commission, the developers and the property owners.\n\nWRTV\n\nThe neighbors cite a number of concerns, including a fear of density issues \u2014 meaning they feel it will make the area too crowded and questions about height for the plan.\n\n\"The density is far too intense for this suburban, environmentally area,\" Kautzman said.\n\nThe proposal has received heavy criticism from neighbors since the project was first introduced in 2021.\n\nWRTV\n\nThe developer has since modified their plan to lower the number of apartment units they originally allotted for, but the lawsuit claims there is still too many.\n\nThey argue that the Metropolitan Development Commission's vote to approve the rezoning shouldn\u2019t be allowed.\n\n\"We hope that the city-county council agrees with us that the development commission decision was improper and should be reversed,\" Kautzman said.\n\nElements\n\nNothing is final yet, the Indy City-County Council will vote on a rezoning in February.\n\nCity officials tell WRTV they can't comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe developer wrote on its website that it has revised plans with neighbors' concerns in mind, however, the developer never directly responded to our request for comment."

        "title": "Ripple CTO Says Hooks Could Pose Multibillion-Dollar Risk for XRPL Users - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has highlighted the potential hazards linked to the experimentation of smart contract-like capabilities in the XRP Ledger through Hooks.\n\nThe commentary came during an exclusive interview with CoinDesk. The interviewer probed the exploration of the Hooks feature, seeking insights into its roadmap and significance for XRP stakeholders.\n\nIn response, Schwartz disclosed that Ripple had minimal input into the development of Hooks. He noted the Ripple team acknowledged its promising potential during initial discussions.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTwo Potential Risks of Hooks for XRP Stakeholders\n\nHowever, Schwartz voiced two potential risks associated with Hooks for the XRP ecosystem. Firstly, he underscored the substantial financial risk posed by any potential flaws in the feature that could compromise the integrity of the XRP Ledger.\n\nAccording to the Ripple CTO, such flaws \u201cwould be a multibillion-dollar problem\u201d for XRP investors and stakeholders.\n\nFurthermore, Schwartz stressed the importance of preserving the XRP Ledger\u2019s primary function as a robust payment platform.\n\nHe expressed concerns that adopting Hooks could transform XRPL into a more Ethereum-like network. Essentially, he sees it altering XRPL\u2019s core purpose as a seamless payment protocol.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNonetheless, during the interview, Schwartz expressed openness to welcoming XRPL\u2019s potential to serve purposes beyond its primary focus.\n\nHe welcomed the concept of other chains evolving around XRPL, addressing diverse use cases like smart contracts, real-world asset tokenization, and tokenized securities.\n\nPotential Adoption of Hooks on XRP Mainnet\n\nFurthermore, the Ripple executive noted that the XRPL Labs, the team behind Hooks, had launched their network, Xahau, utilizing XRPL technology.\n\nAs The Crypto Basic reported previously, Schwartz believes Xahau represents an effective avenue to test-run Hooks.\n\nHe mentioned that if the tech demonstrates its efficacy without undermining the network\u2019s performance for other purposes, there could be a proposal to incorporate Hooks into the XRP Ledger mainnet. Schwartz sees such a proposal coming to fruition within the next year or two."

        "title": "Important Ripple v. SEC Lawsuit Update: Details - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nThe SEC has escalated its legal case against Ripple, demanding financial documents, which the firm contests as irrelevant.\n\nThe company, having secured several partial legal victories in 2023, prepares for a trial scheduled for April 23, 2024.\n\nAnother Confrontation\n\nAfter a prolonged period of inactivity, the legal battle between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple escalated this month. First, the regulator requested an order compelling the company to hand over its financial statements for 2022 and 2023 and its post-complaint XRP sales contracts.\n\nRipple had until January 17 to comply and asked the deadline for a response to be extended to January 19. It later opposed the SEC\u2019s demand, claiming that those records were untimely and unrelated to the case.\n\nThis caused the watchdog to re-file the motion, arguing that the documents could provide vital information regarding the financial condition of Ripple over the years and show whether it has violated certain securities laws.\n\nThe company\u2019s attorneys reacted with a motion to file a sur-reply letter, seeking \u201cto correct a significant factual mischaracterization made by the SEC.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Court would benefit from the sur-reply letter because it will clarify the issues in dispute and allow the Court to rule on an accurate record,\u201d Ripple\u2019s defense team added.\n\nThe US lawyer and former federal prosecutor \u2013 James Filan \u2013 revealed that the US magistrates have allowed the firm to go forward.\n\nThe Approaching Dates\n\nThe latest clash between the parties comes less than three months before their trial (scheduled for April 23, 2024). Ripple seemingly has the upper hand, securing three partial court victories throughout 2023.\n\nThe first occurred in July when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that the company\u2019s programmatic sales to secondary trading platforms did not constitute offers of investment contracts. More details can be found in the video below:\n\nShortly after, the magistrates dismissed the SEC\u2019s intention to appeal the decision, while Ripple\u2019s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen were cleared of all claims brought by the watchdog.\n\nThe two organizations must comply with the necessary procedures before meeting in court. The SEC must file its brief with respect to remedies by March 13, 2024, whereas Ripple must file its opposition by April 12, 2024."

        "title": "Ripple v. SEC takes a new turn as XRP tumbles - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ripple and the SEC continue legal wars over audits.\n\nThe number of XRP holders continues to increase.\n\nThe ongoing legal dispute between Ripple [XRP] and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) persists, which is evident in the recent court filings. Despite a previous year\u2019s judgment providing temporary relief for Ripple, the legal conflict is still ongoing.\n\nRipple counters SEC\u2019s compelling suit\n\nThe recent days have witnessed intense exchanges between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple.\n\nEarlier this year, the SEC sought a court order compelling Ripple to disclose its financial statements for 2022 and 2023, along with institutional sales contracts, since the SEC initiated the lawsuit in late 2020.\n\nIn response, Ripple argued that the discovery phase had concluded in August 2021, and its post-suit conduct and financial condition were irrelevant, as it did not contest its ability to pay penalties.\n\nOn the 23rd of January, the SEC contended that a detailed examination of these contracts was crucial to assessing whether Ripple\u2019s planned XRP sales aligned with the court\u2019s summary judgment order.\n\nHowever, in a response filed on 24th of January, Ripple submitted a Motion to File a Sur-Reply. It objected to the SEC\u2019s request, deeming it \u201coverly burdensome.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Ripple disputed the SEC\u2019s assertion that it had documented and produced all XRP sales contracts, asserting that no contracts post-dating 22nd December, 2020, were provided in the ongoing class action suit.\n\nRipple dips into the oversold zone\n\nThe daily timeframe chart of XRP showed a recent downtrend over the past few days.\n\nAs of this writing, it was trading at around $0.5, reflecting a decline of about 1.8% in 24 hours. This downward movement has positioned it below the neutral line on its Relative Strength Index (RSI).\n\nPresently, the RSI has dipped slightly below 30. This suggests that XRP is now in the oversold zone, indicating a strong bearish trend.\n\nMore XRP holders keep emerging\n\nAn analysis of the total number of Ripple XRP holders on Santiment showed a stable trend. At the time of this analysis, the total number of holders was over 5 million.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 XRPs worth today\n\nWhile there has not been a substantial increase in the number of holders, the noteworthy observation is that there has been no reduction.\n\nThis suggests that despite the asset\u2019s current challenges, it continues to attract and maintain a consistent number of holders, reflecting ongoing interest and engagement in XRP."
