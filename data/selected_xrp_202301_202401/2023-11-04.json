        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSam Bankman-Fried supposedly lost $4 million in XRP from Alameda Research, underestimating the issue despite internal concerns.\n\nThe mishandling of the missing XRP eroded trust within Alameda Research\u2019s executive team.\n\nSBF was convicted on multiple fraud and money laundering charges, facing up to 115 years in prison, with his lawyer considering an appeal.\n\nWhat Happened With the Missing XRP?\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal coverage revealed that the former CEO of FTX \u2013 Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) \u2013 had incurred substantial losses when trading Ripple\u2019s native token. The $4 million worth of XRP had \u201csimply vanished\u201d from Alameda Research\u2019s accounts since the 31-year-old American used the sister company to conduct the trading.\n\nSBF assumed that the amount had been transferred from an exchange in the United States to one in South Korea, with the latter \u201cjust dragging its feet in crediting it.\u201d Other people involved in the operation supposedly insisted that Bankman-Fried cease trading so they could figure out where the tokens had gone.\n\n\u201cAt length, Sam agreed. He stopped trading for two weeks. The other members of the management team confirmed that millions of dollars\u2019 worth of Ripple was indeed missing,\u201d the report reads.\n\nOne of Alameda\u2019s managers said the team considered telling investors about the issue so they could think about their options, \u201cbut Sam hated that idea.\u201d SBF continued to insist that the missing assets were no big deal, telling his staff that there was an 80% chance that the XRP stash would eventually turn up somewhere.\n\n\u201cAfter the fact, if we never get any of the Ripple back, no one is going to say it is reasonable for us to have said we have 80% of the Ripple. Everyone is just going to say we lied to them. We\u2019ll be accused by our investors of fraud,\u201d a fellow manager of the company stated.\n\nBy the spring of 2022, many other executives of Alameda Research \u201chad grown to fear how little Sam worried about where exactly their money was.\u201d The firm was making approximately 250,000 trades a day, but the system was not recording all of them.\n\nAccording to the coverage, the missing XRP tokens were \u201cthe final straw\u201d that ended the trust connection between Alameda\u2019s team and SBF.\n\nSBF Might Spent His Life in Jail\n\nBankman-Fried was recently found guilty on all charges: two counts of wire fraud, four counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. This comes roughly a year after his cryptocurrency exchange collapsed, triggering multi-billion losses for investors, while many described this as one of the biggest financial frauds in the history of the USA.\n\nHis sentencing is scheduled for March 28 as he faces the ridiculous 115 years behind bars. SBF\u2019s lawyer said his client respects the jury\u2019s decision but is \u201cvery disappointed with the result,\u201d suggesting a possible appeal on the conviction."

        "title": "Analyst Predicts XRP Rally to $149 as Average Sentiment Oscillator Records Bullish Cross After 2 Years - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "EGRAG, a top market analyst, has identified a bullish cross on the XRP Average Sentiment Oscillator (ASO) indicator after over two years, projecting a substantial rally in the next 275 days.\n\nFor context, the Average Sentiment Oscillator is a market indicator that considers the average percentage values of the bulls and bears. It consists of a blue line (the bulls) and a red line (the bears). Notably, the line with the higher value represents the dominant sentiment.\n\nEGRAG earlier identified the importance of this indicator in XRP\u2019s price movements since 2017. The ASO indicator has consistently provided accurate signals for XRP\u2019s next trend direction. EGRAG\u2019s first report on this pattern came up on Feb. 25.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAt the time, the analyst highlighted two instances in which the indicator accurately signaled an XRP price surge and dip through bullish and bearish crosses.\n\nHistorical Precedence to the ASO Indicator\n\nNotably, the bullish cross comes up when the blue line crosses above the red line. However, the bearish cross occurs when the red line crosses above the blue line. Data from EGRAG\u2019s chart reveals that XRP observed a bullish cross in March 2017.\n\nWhen this bullish cross occurred, XRP was trading between $0.00525 and $0.02254. However, following the cross, the asset engineered a massive rally, eventually surging to the all-time high of $3.31 in January 2018.\n\nNonetheless, the ASO indicator witnessed a bearish cross in September 2018, resulting in an XRP collapse to $0.1747 in December 2019. Another bullish cross materialized shortly after, with XRP leveraging it for a rally to the $1.96 price territory in April 2021. However, this rally was short-lived as a bearish cross last May resulted in a subsequent drop.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nXRP Witnesses Another Bullish Cross\n\nXRP remains in this bearish territory, with EGRAG\u2019s February post suggesting that the ASO indicator is on the verge of a third bullish cross. At the time of the initial disclosure, the gap between the red and blue lines was still noticeably large.\n\nAs the gap became smaller, the analyst provided periodic updates to the analysis. The most recent update confirms that the gap has closed, with the ASO indicator observing the bullish cross.\n\nEGRAG also pointed out that it has taken an average of 275 days, or nine months, for XRP to witness the peak of its bull run after each cross. Considering this estimate, he believes market participants could observe a massive price pump for XRP in the next seven to ten months.\n\nWhile he did not give any specific price target in his latest post, the analyst had already made a price projection earlier. Interestingly, in one of his updates to the February post, EGRAG predicted that XRP could rally 28,250% when the cross occurs. At the time, this rate amounted to $149.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP continues to trade above the $0.61 territory in the short term. The asset currently changes hands at $0.6147, up 1.87% over the last 24 hours. Trade Volume has dropped by 35% within the same timeframe, currently standing at $1,092,004."

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn the past week, the market has been impacted by significant events such as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the decision to maintain current interest rates, and the conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) on fraud charges. During these developments, Bitcoin (BTC) managed to reach the $36,000 mark, raising chances for further increases. Consequently, traders are hopeful for a rally to $40,000 in the coming week, coinciding with Ripple\u2019s ongoing legal negotiations with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nCrucial Developments To Watch Next Week\n\nThe upcoming week seems less eventful due to a lighter schedule of activities. Nonetheless, the market could still experience some volatility as traders anticipate significant developments from Ripple\u2019s upcoming meeting with the SEC.\n\nRipple\u2019s Meeting With The SEC\n\nThe crypto community is preparing for DC Fintech Week, kicking off on November 6, featuring Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and SEC Chair Gary Gensler as marquee speakers.\n\nThis development has sparked excitement and expectation for the stimulating exchanges and dialogues anticipated at the 2023 DC Fintech Week. Given Ripple\u2019s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC regarding the classification of XRP as a security, supporters are looking forward to potentially intense debates and insider insights next week, impacting XRP price.\n\nThe announcement that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and SEC Chair Gary Gensler will be headline speakers might lead the two figures to engage over the contentious issue. Additionally, per the court order issued on October 24, 2023, the SEC and Ripple are required to suggest a timeline for briefings on the associated allegations in the SEC v. Ripple litigation by November 9, 2023.\n\nFollowing the court decision on Programmatic Sales, the issue concerning the institutional sales of XRP still stands. A settlement in the SEC-Ripple talks could lead to the SEC revisiting prior XRP sale judgments. Ripple may pay a fine to validate existing rulings following the SEC\u2019s failed bid to conceal key documents, impacting further discussions.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s $40K Dream\n\nOver the next week, the market will be closely watching Bitcoin\u2019s movement as the price has long been attempting to surge above the crucial $36.7K mark. Bitcoin delivered an exceptional performance, recording its best monthly closure in October with a 30% uptick.\n\nAs November is carrying the Uptober trend, the chances of a Bitcoin ETF have boosted the market\u2019s hopes. Although Bitcoin is currently consolidating, several analysts predict that the rally isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin is experiencing a negative Netflow, indicating that investors are accumulating the cryptocurrency and withdrawing it from exchanges\u2014thus reducing exchange reserves\u2014the likelihood of a drastic sell-off declines. A breach of the pivotal $36,700 mark next week could quickly send Bitcoin\u2019s value to the $40,000 threshold."
