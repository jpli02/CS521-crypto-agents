        "content": "Carl XVI Gustaf has previously indicated he was determined to remain on the throne until his death. \"Retirement? No, that word doesn't actually run in our family. At least not historically,\" he told Swedish outlet Expressen in 2014. \"It is an old tradition of ours not to retire.\"\n\nSimilarly, Harald has told Norwegian media that the oath he took in 1991 is \"for life\": \"It's that simple for me. We're at it until the bitter end.\"\n\n\"Norwegians will support Harald [if he abdicates], but they are very impressed he is still on the throne in spite of all his health issues,\" said Kristi Marie Skrede, royal correspondent for Norway's NRK TV.\n\nTheir reluctance has sometimes seemed surprising: after decades of service, it is unlikely they would be berated for stepping down.\n\nThe youngest of the three, Carl XVI Gustaf, is 77, and has been on the Swedish throne since he was 27; once Margarethe steps down, he will become the third current longest-reigning monarch in the world.\n\nHarald, who will be 87 next month, has taken sick leave a number of times - including to undergo surgery for heart problems and bladder cancer, and was admitted to hospital with an infection as recently as last year. His son, Haakon, seamlessly stepped in to act as regent. Like the heirs of the other Nordic royal houses, he is highly popular.\n\nIs it possible, then, that Margrethe's abdication will pave the way for similar moves in neighbouring kingdoms?\n\n\"Had you asked me this question six months ago I would have said never, ever will they abdicate,\" said Mr Lundgren. \"But the Denmark case shows anything can happen.\""

        "title": "Ripple CTO: 25 Billion XRP 'Transaction' Was Not A Flaw - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple, has commented on the alleged \u201ctransaction\u201d of 25.6 billion (almost 15 billion US dollars) XRP on January 14. This amount represented almost half of the total circulating supply of XRP, which stands at approximately 54.26 billion. The supposed transaction was reported by the highly-regarded blockchain tracking service Whale Alert to have originated from an unknown wallet, destined for the crypto exchange Bitfinex.\n\nSubsequent investigations, however, quickly debunked the initial concerns. Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Bitfinex, clarified that the event was not a transaction but an attempted exploit of the \u201cPartial Payments\u201d feature in the XRP Ledger. This revelation came as a relief to many in the crypto community, given the potential implications of such a large movement of XRP.\n\nIn a follow-up statement, Whale Alert also admitted to the mistake, stating, \u201cThere was an issue with properly reading the Ripple node response, resulting in a few wrong posts. We fixed the issue.\u201d Adding to this, Ardoino shed more light on the situation. He remarked, \u201cSomeone attempted to attack Bitfinex via \u2018Partial Payments Exploit\u2019. The attack failed since Bitfinex properly handles the \u2018delivered_amount\u2019 data field.\u201d\n\nRipple CTO Clarifies The Incident\n\nSchwartz, known as \u201cJoelKatz\u201d online, provided further clarification on the incident. Contrary to some claims that the partial payment was a security flaw of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), he clarified that the \u2018billions of XRP moved\u2019 statement is misleading.\n\n\u201cThe actual amount transferred was worth just a few cents. Kudos to Bitfinex and Paolo Ardoino for effectively neutralizing an exploit attempt. What happened here isn\u2019t a flaw or vulnerability with the XRP Ledger. The Partial Payments feature is a standard and secure financial tool,\u201d the Ripple CTO explained.\n\nHe further highlighted that Bitfinex handled the exploit attempt properly, which is why they were able to prevent any potential issue. \u201cToday\u2019s thwart is a strong reminder to all institutions and applications \u2013 the importance of proper configuration and integration cannot be understated,\u201d Schwartz stressed.\n\nHe also directed users to a resource for secure integration with the XRPL\u2019s Proper Payments feature, available at https://xrpl.org/partial-payments.html. The website explains the functionality and potential risks associated with Partial Payments, emphasizing the importance of understanding the delivered_amount metadata field versus the Amount field in a transaction.\n\nThe document outlines the differences between transactions with and without the Partial Payment flag. For standard payments, the \u201cAmount\u201d field specifies the exact amount to be delivered, while in partial payments, this field indicates a maximum amount, with the transaction succeeding even if only a portion of the intended value is sent. This functionality, while useful in certain scenarios, can be exploited in poorly integrated systems, leading to potential losses.\n\nAt press time, XRP traded at $0.57306.\n\nFeatured image from Pinterest, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Ripple and Stellar Lumens are lauded as one of the best contributors to cross-border payments, and their compliance with ISO 20022 positions them to compete with Swift.\n\nThe cross-border industry has been predicted to value around $250 trillion by 2027.\n\nThe role of Ripple Labs and Stellar Lumens in the cross-border ecosystem cannot be ignored as they rub shoulders with industry giants like Swift. To many XRP enthusiasts, Ripple\u2019s future in the ecosystem cannot be questioned as it aims to dominate the industry and send the XRP price to an unimaginable height.\n\nAccording to reports, this ecosystem is expected to value around $250 trillion by 2027. Several reports have lauded Ripple\u2019s cross-border capabilities as its transactions are reported to streamline and enhance the efficiency of international financial transfers.\n\nExperts believe that the use of XRP as a bridge currency eliminates cost, positioning it ahead of competitors.\n\nOn top of that, transparency and security which is reported to be an important consideration in every transaction is ensured with the RippleNet network of validators. Stu Alderoty, Ripple\u2019s general counsel, said on record that its regulatory clarity could make it appealing for financial institution customers to embrace it.\n\nI think we\u2019re hopeful that this decision would give financial institution customers or potential customers comfort to at least come in and start having the conversation about what problems they are experiencing in their business, real-world problems in terms of moving value across borders without incurring obscene fees. Hopefully this quarter will generate a lot of conversations in the United States with customers, and hopefully some of those conversations will actually turn into real business.\n\nStellar Lumens and Ripple Could Complete Swift\n\nSimilarly, Stellar Lumen is also a pioneer in cross-border payment. The network was designed to reduce friction, improve financial inclusion, and set new global payment standards. Together with Hedera, Stellar Lumens, and Ripple are among the top ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrencies.\n\nISO 20022 is known as an international protocol meant to replace the SWIFT system. So far, nine cryptos have been certified as ISO 20022-compliant. These are Quant (QNT), XRP, XLM, HBAR, IOTA (MIOTA), XDC Network (XDC), Algorand (ALGO), Cardano (ADA), and Verge (XVG). More cryptos are expected to join after the standardized identifiers for digital currencies which were previously not available were provided by ISO 20022.\n\nSwift is reported to process more than 46 million messages each day, however, Isabel Schmidt, the Co-Head of Global Payments Products at BNY Mellon, believes there is a problem.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only one. Payments are a patchwork. ACH, CHAPS, CHIPS \u2013 they all try to do the same thing. But they are not the same. Networks don\u2019t integrate well with each other or the business processes they support.\n\nThe existing features of Ripple and Stellar Lumen, according to experts, coupled with their ISO 20220 compliance could position them to compete with Swift.\n\nAs of press time, XRP was trading at $0.575122 after declining by 4% in the last 24 hours. Investors, however, have 1.4% return on their investments in the last seven days.\n\nXLM was also trading at $0.119223 after falling by 4.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nRipple Labs recently announced a buyback of $285 million worth of shares from its employees and early investors.\n\nAccording to a recent Reuters report, the company announced that it plans to spend $500 million in planned buyback to cover the costs of converting restricted stock units into taxes and shares.\n\nIt also expects to do more of these share buybacks in the future regularly to provide better liquidity for investors.\n\nUnderstanding XRP and the Ripple Labs\n\nXRP is a cryptocurrency that Ripple Labs uses to conduct transactions on its network.\n\nWhile Ripple is a centralized fintech company that began as Ripplepay in 2004, it was later co-founded by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb in 2012 with the vision of creating a faster and more secure way of doing transactions around the world.\n\nAlthough the two have been used interchangeably, Ripple is a technology company whereas XRP is its open-source digital asset.\n\nThe crypto operates on its blockchain known as the XRP ledger (XRPL) where transactions are facilitated by RTXP or the Ripple transaction protocol.\n\nIt is pre-mined, unlike a lot of other cryptocurrencies, with a maximum token supply of 100 billion.\n\nThe main purpose of the crypto is to serve as a settlement layer that aids in transactions with the Ripple network.\n\nIt has been, however, traded as a cryptocurrency that is available on various exchanges including options, swap exchanges, spot exchanges, futures, custodian and non-custodian exchanges.\n\nXRP vs SEC: The clash\n\nThe United States SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs in 2020 for selling XRP as an \u201cunlicensed security,\u201d claiming that the distribution of $1.3 billion worth of the crypto to its stakeholders violated the law.\n\nThe major bone of contention here was whether XRP was a security and, therefore, whether it was a share in Ripple or if it was a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.\n\nRipple has been at loggerheads with the SEC for a few years now. The SEC claimed that Ripple\u2019s sale of XRP to investors was to fund itself and relied on the 1946 SEC judgment of SEC vs. W.J. Howey Co. to make its case.\n\nIn doing so, the agency stated that whether an investor has control over profit is a deciding factor if an investment contract is a security or not. Ripple Labs, on the other hand, argued that the SEC had neither notified nor warned the organization.\n\nAfter 3 years of deliberation, the case was finally ruled on in July 2023. The court found that XRP was NOT a security in itself.\n\nThe SEC was also denied the request for an interlocutory appeal and, later, had to drop its securities violation charges against Ripple and XRP.\n\nThe SEC got authority over cryptocurrency sales to institutions, whereas crypto-transactions on exchanges would not be treated as securities transactions.\n\nWhat does ChatGPT have to say?\n\nWhile ChatGPT is not equipped with the latest information and does not make any future predictions, I used a jailbreak and asked it about what lies in the future for XRP, keeping in perspective the current scenario.\n\nWhen asked what the future looks like for XRP, given the favorable court ruling, the bot responded by stating that the crypto could see short-term momentum as investor confidence increases.\n\nThis could, however, slow down a bit in the long term as the market is affected by various factors such as adoption, sentiment, and regulatory clarity.\n\nThe bot also stated that while positive developments on the legal front are a positive sign, it is also crucial to keep track of other developments and potential regulatory changes that could affect the price of XRP going forward.\n\nWhen I gave ChatGPT some context with Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s press time price and asked what would be the price of XRP in the first quarter of 2024, the bot made a bold claim that the crypto would hit $10 per token.\n\nIt called this high the \u201ccomeback of the century,\u201d but also warned that its predictions are just speculative, and the actual prices may vary significantly.\n\nFinally, I asked if the crypto would surpass its ATH in 2024. The bot gave me a confident answer, stating that XRP will \u201cblow past\u201d its ATH in 2024 and hit unprecedented heights, leaving its previous all-time high in the dust.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the XRP Profit Calculator\n\nXRP\u2019s recent price movements\n\nXRP was trading at $0.5738 at the time of writing, with a 0.34% surge in the past week of trading.\n\nTaking a closer look at the Awesome Oscillator (AO) it can be observed that green bars were being formed below the 0-level showing potential signs for a pullback.\n\nWhereas, the Relative Strength Index showed a reading of 43 below the 50-mark indicating a weak bearish movement.\n\nCurrently, the price of XRP can be seen trading between the range of $0.5417 and $0.7202, if the price can break through the upper limit of this range then a further increase in its upward trajectory can be expected.\n\nFinal word\n\nAlthough XRP has mostly been trading within a range recently, the Ripple coin has the potential to grow much more shortly if this resistance level gets broken.\n\nChatGPT also seems optimistic about the coin and claims it will make the \u201ccomeback of the century\u201d as it predicts the coin\u2019s prices to reach $10 per token in 2024.\n\nHowever, investors need to be mindful while putting their money on XRP and not get swayed away by ChatGPT\u2019s optimism as it is just a computer program. Doing your research is the best way to navigate the crypto space wisely."
