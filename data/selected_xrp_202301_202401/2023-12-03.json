So they could use us as their sub-custodian and use our regulatory permissions, etc. I think the multiple networks that are out there are really key in terms of linking custodians together, and linking custodians to exchanges and venues in a compliant manner.\u201d"

        "content": "Every year around this time, a top-ranked U.S.-based law firm fires the first shot. It announces a new associate pay scale and annual bonuses, sending the U.S. industry into a tizzy as firm after firm considers whether to match, or even exceed the new rates, and prompting non-U.S. firms to shake their heads in disbelief at the amount of money thrown at newly minted associates who don\u2019t know the first thing about practicing law.\n\nYet, like much that occurs in the legal industry, there is a ripple effect when this happens. It is a highly competitive industry, especially at the top tier, and no firm wants to be outdone. While this year the ripples came slowly, last week the floodgates opened."

        "content": "Buyers are attempting to push XRP above $0.61.\n\nLiquidation can occur around $0.58 due to high liquidity concentration.\n\nIn usual fashion, Ripple [XRP] has locked one billion XRP tokens, according to a revelation by Whale Alert. A look at the transactions showed that the blockchain payment firm locked the tokens in four different batches.\n\nThis includes a first 200 million lock in escrow, followed by a 300 million transfer. The project then ended the transaction with a 500 million XRP lock.\n\nXRP sentiment changes\n\nRipple has a habit of locking tokens at the end of every month or the beginning of a new one. The project does this because it does not have a mining reward system like Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nSo, to cover the loophole, it put up a plan to lock 55 billion tokens to balance the demand and supply levels of XRP.\n\nSometimes, the activity leads to a surge or decline in the XRP value. However, AMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of the XRP price action showed that the cryptocurrency only consolidated this time.\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP\u2019s value was $0.61\u2014 around the same value it was on the 2nd of December.\n\nDespite the sideways XRP movement, the sentiment around the token seems to have changed. On the 30th of November, XRP\u2019s Weighted Sentiment was -0.45. The reading at that time implies that the broader market was bearish on the price.\n\nBut at the time of writing, the Weighted Sentiment had climbed into the positive region. If the reading continues to grow, it means market players are convinced that XRP\u2019s price might soon increase.\n\nThe token offers risk and reward\n\nAlso, Santiment data provided context by considering the Relative Strength Index (RSI). At press time, the RSI reading per 4-hour chart was 62.06. This reading suggests that buyers are trying to get XRP above $0.61.\n\nShould the RSI reading continue to climb, XRP may be able to retest $0.65 in the short term.\n\nAMBCrypto also considered the XRP liquidation heatmap using HyblockCapital\u2019s data. The liquidation heatmap helps traders to identify high-liquidity areas.\n\nA high concentration of liquidity around a particular region means a cryptocurrency price can head in that direction. For XRP, the high liquidation level zone was around $0.62, indicating that the token has a good chance of hitting the price.\n\nRead Ripple\u2019s [XRP] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nHowever, short-positioned traders need to watch out for the $0.58 level where there was also a high level of liquidity. If XRP retraces, a lot of liquidation can happen in the zone.\n\nIn the meantime, the Ripple native token may continue consolidating. But if a large buy order comes in, traders should expect the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to jump above $0.62."

        "content": "In the last two centuries London\u2019s oldest bookshop, Hatchards on Piccadilly, has sold stories of royal scandals, ructions and rifts.\n\nThe latest book in the royal genre, Endgame by journalist Omid Scobie, was at the centre of a media frenzy for most of last week, but was barely causing a ripple among shoppers this weekend. It was not on prominent display at the five-storey bookstore, which has royal warrants. The single copy had been put aside on order. At the nearby Waterstones, about 14 copies were stacked on a table near the entrance, but there was limited interest there too.\n\nThe book by a journalist who is viewed by many as a cheerleader for Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex has received some scathing reviews, with the Evening Standard describing it as an \u201cabsolute turkey\u201d. The Washington Post observed that \u201cthe royal tea spilled here isn\u2019t exactly hot\u201d. But thanks to its rehashing of a story about whether two members of the royal family discussed the potential skin colour of Harry and Meghan\u2019s first child, it has prompted a wave of front-page headlines.\n\nAt Hatchards, many shoppers had not heard of the book and most of those who had did not intend to buy it. Tom Manson, 40, a chartered surveyor from Clitheroe, Lancashire, said he considered coverage of the book \u201csalacious nonsense\u201d.\n\nHe said the royal family were in an impossible position over the row about allegations of remarks about the skin colour of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s unborn son. \u201cThey are in a no-win situation,\u201d said Manson. \u201cThey are damned if they do and damned if they don\u2019t. We will never know what people did or did not do, and can we be bothered?\u201d\n\nThe Dutch version of the book was pulled from the shelves last week, after naming King Charles and the Princess of Wales for taking part in conversations about Prince Archie before his birth.\n\nJo Lancaster, 36, a lawyer, who lives near Crawley, West Sussex, said: \u201cThere are things going on that are much more important than who said what in a conversation in the royal family. It is sensationalism.\u201d\n\nJames Gourlay, 35, an investment adviser from south London, said he would not buy the book, but felt he had gleaned its key points from media coverage and social media. \u201cYou get enough snippets through social media to get the gist,\u201d he said.\n\nGourlay said he supported Prince Harry and Meghan. He said: \u201cI really like Prince Harry. I think he has done incredibly good work. They seem decent people.

Raison said: \u201cIn Canada, we are very proud of Prince Harry and Meghan.\u201d\n\nThe pair, who were en route to Buckingham Palace, said the row over the remarks involving racism or unconscious bias was \u201cridiculous\u201d.
