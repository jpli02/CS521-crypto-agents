        "content": "Even as XRP encountered considerable upheaval due to escalating regulatory challenges, South Korean investors have remained unfazed. In fact, the asset has emerged as the most preferred one in their portfolios, especially those in their 20s. This is evident by new findings, which show XRP comprising 20.7% of their investments, surpassing the combined 17.5% allocation for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOverall, the proportion of XRP in the portfolios of individuals in their twenties exceeds that of Bitcoin and Ethereum by approximately 3.2%.\n\nXRP Overtakes BTC in Korea as Preferred Investment\n\nIndividuals in this particular age bracket exhibit an inclination towards \u201caggressive\u201d investing, as opposed to investors from other age demographics in South Korea. It was also found that this cohort of market players displays a preference for altcoins over Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe Bithumb report, which extensively examined data on investor portfolios for this year, highlighted that more than 82% of investors in their twenties lean towards altcoins with greater volatility as compared to the world\u2019s top two crypto-assets.\n\nThis is in contrast with the 30-year-old age group, which was found to have the highest investment weighting in Bitcoin and Ethereum at 28.2%, demonstrating varying preferences among the different age groups in the country.\n\nKim Dong-hwan, CEO of South Korea\u2019s virtual asset specialist Wonderframe, believes investors in their 20s have an investment tendency aimed at short-term profits rather than long-term investments.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP investment ratios across investors in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and other were \u2013 17%, 11.8%, 14.9%, and 13.8%, respectively.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s XRP Fixation\n\nThe report isn\u2019t surprising since XRP trading activity has been heavily concentrated on South Korean exchanges, with volumes on prominent local crypto exchanges Upbit and Bithumb even exceeding that of Bitcoin and Ethereum at times.\n\nLast year, XRP was ranked the second-most popular crypto-asset in the country after Bitcoin, as per a study conducted by South Korea\u2019s leading crypto exchanges \u2013 Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. As such, XRP was found to be more attractive than Ether and Cardano, which stood in third and fourth place, respectively."

        "content": "Celsius investor Otis Davis had asked the US Bankruptcy Court to recognize the legal precedent set by SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit and classify CEL as a security.\n\nThe judge declined to say whether CEL token is a security, in light of the ongoing developments in the Ripple XRP case.\n\nCEL price is in a downward trend, developments in the Bankruptcy case acted as a bearish catalyst for the token.\n\nCelsius, a bankrupt crypto lender\u2019s case, has been ongoing in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Following Ripple\u2019s partial victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) lawsuit, Celsius investor, Otis Davis, asked the presiding judge to recognize CEL as a security.\n\nThe presiding Judge Martin Glenn, rejected the legal precedent and the motion and stated that nothing in the Motions or announced at the Hearing constitutes a finding under the federal securities laws as to whether crypto tokens or transactions involving crypto tokens are securities.\n\nGlenn recognized that the US SEC is within its rights to challenge transactions involving crypto tokens on any basis. Investor Davis was turned down and CEL\u2019s status as a security or non-security hangs in the balance until the next hearing.\n\nThe developments in Bankruptcy court have negatively influenced the token\u2019s price. CEL is trading at $0.123, down from its June peak of $0.382.\n\nAlso read: Celsius creditors to vote on asset sale plan that could recover up to 85% of holdings\n\nCEL token fails to receive non-security status at Bankruptcy court\n\nCelsius token investors planned to create a new separate committee of CEL token holders in the bankruptcy proceedings to better cater to their interests and their fund recovery. However, this plan was turned down by presiding Judge Martin Glenn, after he failed to recognize the legal precedent set in the Ripple/ XRP case.\n\nThe motion was rejected and Celsius token holders\u2019 demands remained unmet, as court proceedings continued. The CEL token has been surrounded by controversy ever since the bankruptcy report found that Celsius used a strategy to sell the tokens in private, Over-The-Counter (OTC) transactions and offsetting purchases in the public market. These actions have likely influenced the price of CEL token over the years.\n\nFormer CEO Alex Mashinsky has been accused of holding, selling the CEL token for expectation of profits. Amidst these updates, the court has refused to comment on security status of the token, adding further downside to CEL price and its community of holders.\n\nAt the time of writing, CEL price is down 25% over the past month."

        "title": "BRICS Launches Multi-Currency Digital Payment System: Ripple\u2019s XRP Poised for $5 Surge? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "BRICS nations discuss the potential of a common currency and digital payment system, hinting at a shift away from the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP sees an opportunity amidst global financial shifts, as market speculators forecast a significant surge.\n\nAs the global financial landscape continues to evolve, a groundbreaking report from Reuters indicates that the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are actively considering a potential common currency. This move aims to reduce their dependence on the U.S. dollar, which has historically been the linchpin of international trade.\n\nA Push for Multi-Currency Dominance\n\nAt the recent 2023 BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, Brazil\u2019s President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, fervently proposed the idea of a common currency. The motivation? To shield these powerful nations from the unpredictable ebbs and flows of the dollar exchange rates. This suggestion has not only reverberated through the political spheres of these nations but has caught the attention of financial sectors globally.\n\nOpinions from BRICS Leaders\n\nDespite the enthusiasm from Brazil, not all BRICS nations seem to be on the same page. Prior to the summit, South African officials remarked that the common currency concept wasn\u2019t on the summit\u2019s agenda. India\u2019s stance remained ambiguous as they discussed enhancing trade in national currencies.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized the idea of trading in national currencies over the U.S. dollar. China, while silent on the currency issue, emphasized the need for reforms in the global financial system.\n\nThe Potential Ripple Effect: XRP\u2019s Golden Opportunity?\n\nWhile discussions around a new currency regime gain momentum, market speculators see a unique opening for Ripple\u2019s XRP. The digital currency, known for its swift cross-border transaction capabilities, could play a vital role in the BRICS\u2019 envisioned digital payment system. With the global shift towards de-dollarization and the BRICS nations\u2019 quest for financial autonomy, digital currencies like XRP might be the missing piece of the puzzle.\n\nChallenges in the BRICS Currency Landscape\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing for the proposed BRICS currency. Creating a shared currency involves navigating through political, economic, and geographical disparities. Moreover, trade imbalances, especially with China being a primary trading partner for all BRICS nations, present another hurdle.\n\nYet, the BRICS nations are exploring innovative solutions. One such effort is a local currency trade test between China\u2019s Hunan province and Ghana. This model provides SME traders with an opportunity to engage in foreign trade without the traditional foreign exchange risks.\n\nThe Role of Gold and XRP\n\nThere\u2019s also growing chatter about re-monetizing gold. But an intriguing alternative gaining traction is benchmarking BRICS currencies against gold prices, rather than backing them with physical bullion. This new system, combined with the possibility of utilizing digital currencies like XRP, could reshape the financial future of these nations.\n\nWith global eyes on BRICS and its next steps, Ripple\u2019s XRP stands at a pivotal crossroad. As the digital currency realm anticipates potential integrations with this new multi-currency system, a surge in XRP\u2019s value might just be on the horizon.\n\nRecommended for you:"
