        "content": "Ripple announces Monica Long as President\n\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly honored to take on the role of President at Ripple as we expand deeper into crypto-enabled services like liquidity, settlement and custody.\u201d\n\nRipple Labs has promoted SVP and General Manager Monica Long to the role of President after the firm\u2019s strongest year yet, despite multiple crypto winters and headwinds in the industry.\n\nMonica Long joined Ripple in 2013 when the company had only 10 employees. Under her leadership, and working alongside engineering and product, Monica Long\u2019s team helped launch On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), an enterprise crypto solution for cross-border transactions and Ripple\u2019s flagship product in 2018.\n\nLast year, approximately 60% of payments over RippleNet were sent through ODL. Ripple has processed $30B worth of volume and 20M transactions since RippleNet was first launched.\n\nMonica Long was critical in Ripple\u2019s ODL, NFTs, CBDCs\n\nIn August 2020, she was promoted to General Manager of RippleX, where she oversaw product, engineering, partnerships, marketing and developer relations.\n\nAs GM of RippleX, she worked to support an open community of crypto developers innovating across creator economies, payments, identity, foreign exchange, digital media, gaming, and central bank digital currencies.\n\nIn that role, she led a team that launched and contributed to -along with the community- the first phase of the EVM sidechain and brought NFTs to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) under the proposed amendment, XLS-20, as well as inked key CBDC partnerships with the countries of Palau and Bhutan. In addition, they led funding for and helped launch 100+ projects through grants, accelerators, bounties, hackathons and the XRPL Zone.\n\nIn June 2022, she took on the RippleNet General Manager role, in addition to RippleX, where she was responsible for the development and growth of ODL and global customer success.\n\n\u201cA force to be reckoned with\u201d\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, Chief Executive Officer at Ripple, said: \u201cFrom the moment I first met Monica nearly eight years ago at Ripple, it was clear that she was a force to be reckoned with. Her deep knowledge of crypto paired with her determination, creativity and ability to think out of the box has made her one of the most respected leaders in the industry and certainly at Ripple. Even in the current challenging crypto environment, Monica has helped guide Ripple to a very unique place of growth and financial strength. She\u2019s been an instrumental adviser to me over the years and I\u2019m grateful to have the opportunity to partner with her even more closely as she embarks on her role as President.\u201d\n\nMonica Long, President at Ripple Labs, commented: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly honored to take on the role of President at Ripple as we expand deeper into crypto-enabled services like liquidity, settlement and custody. Looking back over my tenure, I can say without a doubt that I\u2019ve been lucky enough to be surrounded by some of the smartest, most innovative people in crypto and tech, as we tackled some huge audacious goals- like being able to send money instantly for fractions of a penny around the world. The Internet of Value is a mission I believed in on day one and continue to find inspiration in for the future.\u201d\n\nChris Larsen, Executive Chairman and co-founder at Ripple, added: \u201cWhen I think about the beginning of Ripple and where we are now \u2013 so much of that is due to Monica\u2019s leadership and strategic insights. She joined us when crypto was unheard of, and to see her grow over the last ten years into the fantastic leader she is today, is a testament to how far the industry has come.\u201d"

        "content": "Pantojas, the humanist chaplain at Tufts University, will deliver the keynote address during the student-led Ripple Conference from Feb. 17-19 hosted by Truitt Center for Religious and Spiritual Life.\n\nShare this page on Facebook Share this page on X (formerly Twitter) Share this page on LinkedIn Email this page to a friend Print this page\n\nAnthony Cruz Pantojas, the humanist chaplain at Tufts University, will be coming to Elon to give the keynote address for the annual student-led Ripple Conference, now in its eighth year.\n\nPantojas will give their keynote address, \u201cLiving in the Interstices: Spiritual Reflections from a Queer Afro-Caribbean Humanist\u201d on Friday, Feb. 17 at 6:30 p.m. Registration is open on the Ripple Conference website.\n\nAccording to Pantojas, this talk explores the significance of personal history as a site of knowledge production and worldmaking, and will challenge the audience to see beyond their own experiences.\n\n\u201cIn particular, I will contextualize the questions that have guided my spiritual, philosophical, and ethical journey,\u201d explained Pantojas. \u201cI want to talk about things that might make the audience a little uncomfortable, invite them to sit with that discomfort and to think about potential. Leaning into and exploring otherness will free us to think about relating and understanding, and ultimately how we can work towards liberatory futures for all.\u201d\n\nThe Ripple Conference takes place at Elon from Feb. 17-19 and this year will focus on the theme of \u201cStretching the Limits of Religious Identities.\u201d This theme centers on the idea that no religion, spirituality, faith tradition, philosophy or worldview is a monolith. During this year\u2019s conference, participants will be encouraged to think outside the box, celebrate their own overlapping intersectional identities and make space to learn, grow, and engage.\n\n\u201cThe Ripple Conference provides a space for Elon students to learn and challenge their ideas of religious, spiritual, ethical, and philosophical constructs alongside students from other campuses regionally and nationally,\u201d said Elon University Chaplain and Dean of Multifaith Engagement Rev. Kirstin Boswell.\n\n\u201cEach year\u2019s theme is different, and I think that as we look at the national discourse around religion that is ofttimes so divisive, it is of the highest importance this year to invite our students \u2014 the world\u2019s future leaders \u2014 to examine, grapple with, and stretch the boundaries of religious identity,\u201d Boswell added.\n\nFor Pantojas, this theme is part of their own lived experience. \u201cI hope to share my identities and experiences that revitalize how we might think about being, becoming, and belonging. This keynote is a reflective treatise and invitation to think \u2018otherwise,\u2019\u201d Pantojas said.\n\nPantojas is a bilingual doctoral candidate in cultural studies, and is also the inaugural graduate student of the Anti-Racist Curatorial Practice Program. Pantojas has been recognized with numerous awards, including an Interfaith Innovation Fellowship sponsored by Interfaith America and spearheads an initiative for BIPOC first-generation emerging spiritual and ethical leaders. Pantojas earned master\u2019s degrees in theological studies and leadership studies from Andover Newton Theological School and Meadville Lombard Theological School, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, they hold a certificate in humanist studies from the American Humanist Association Center for Education where they are the first graduate of the program. Currently, they serve as an advisory committee member for Spiritual Care by & for the Unaffiliated with the Chaplaincy Innovation Lab, sponsored by Fetzer Institute. Additionally, they serve as a board member of the Association of Chaplaincy and Spiritual Life in Higher Education, the Secular Coalition for America, Mystic Soul Project, among other nonprofit organizations.\n\nAccording to the American Humanist Association, humanism is an approach to life based on reason and our common humanity, recognizing that moral values are properly founded on human nature and experience alone. For Pantojas, humanism is also about the complexities, challenges, and possibilities of culture, power and spirituality. Humanists might identify in different ways, whether agnostic, atheist, non-theist or freethinker.\n\nPantojas will bring this worldview to Elon, as they engage with the students at the Ripple Conference and encourage them to stretch the limits of how they both view religion and spirituality and the ways they engage with and foster understanding of one another. In the keynote, Pantojas will also center on minoritized identities that have not been prioritized in traditional interreligious engagement.\n\n\u201cIn this time of great polarization and precarity, the need to understand the diverse narratives and lived experiences of others is great. Historically, the discourses surrounding religion and interreligious engagement have centered on Western modernity, theist, and notably Christian paradigm. Interreligious work means talking about difference, ethics, and hospitality in our ever-changing world,\u201d explained Pantojas.\n\nBoswell concurs. \u201cWhether we are talking about the intersections of religion and politics, religion and health care access, religion and social justice, or religion and care for our planet, or a host of other intersectional themes, these are areas that are highly fraught and laden with baggage and emotion. Spaces like the Ripple Conference allow students\u2014and all of our community members\u2014to think about these issues in a real way in a space that will challenge and push them to determine how they will interact with these issues in the real world.\u201d\n\nMore about the Ripple Conference:\n\nEarly Bird Registration for the Ripple Conference is now open and will run through Jan. 30.\n\nRegistration information can be found at rippleconference.org. Elon students, faculty, and staff are invited to reach out to Ivy Breivogel or Hillary Zaken, or DM @truittcenter on Instagram for codes for discounted participation. On the website, you can register for the conference, apply for leadership, and view the schedule and other conference details as they become available. Opportunities include leading breakout sessions, community groups, affinity groups, or performing in the Sacred Sounds Coffee House.\n\nFor more information and updates about the Ripple Interfaith Conference, please follow the Truitt Center for Religious and Spiritual Life on Instagram and visit the Truitt Center website or the Ripple Conference website."

        "title": "The ripple effects of invoking draconian laws must not be ignored - Policy Options",
        "content": "After six weeks of public hearings, the public inquiry into the use of the Emergencies Act came to a close on Nov. 26, 2022, after a marathon of 300 hours of testimony and 9,000 exhibits, and more than 70 witnesses. Announced on April, 25, 2022, the Public Order Emergency Commission, led by Justice Paul Rouleau, was mandated to examine and assess the basis for the government\u2019s decision to declare a public order emergency, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of the measures selected by the government to deal with the situation. The Emergencies Act was designed to balance the maintenance of public order with the protection of civil liberties.\n\nAround the same time but with much less fanfare and public exposure, an obscure inquiry was being conducted by the Senate\u2019s Human Rights Committee, chaired by Senator Salma Ataullahjan, looking at systemic biases and Islamophobia. Despite the obvious differences between the two inquiries, there are many threads that connect their relevance for Canadians.\n\nBoth examine the extent of damage that can result from the use of government discretion when applying draconian laws such as the Emergencies Act or antiterrorism laws. It is puzzling, however, that antiterrorism laws have not attracted attention or generated much concern among Canadians despite their intrusion into the civil liberties space.\n\nSince their introduction post 9/11, antiterrorism laws have broadened the executive power of the government with little or no oversight. They have introduced permanent changes to the Criminal Code, the Official Secrets Act, the Privacy Act and the Canada Evidence Act, giving the government and its agencies far-reaching powers in the process. A new Crown corporation, the Canadian Air Transport Security Agency was created in 2002. The Financial Transactions Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) was given antiterrorist financial tracking responsibilities.\n\nThen in 2015, the Anti-Terrorism Act (Bill C-51) underwent a major overhaul under the Harper government resulting in a massive expansion of state power without oversight or safeguards. More than 100 Canadian law professors warned that this bill was a \u201cdangerous piece of legislation.\u201d There were fears that the changes would erode democratic checks and balances, weaken the established guarantees of the rule of law and infringe on civil liberties. These fears will only grow with the increased pervasiveness of digital technology and growing sensitivities around privacy and surveillance.\n\nBut despite these fears and many protestations, the antiterror laws have proven remarkably resistant to amendments or repeal. Various governments of different political persuasions lacked either the will or the aptitude, or both, to change course. The only positive amendment adopted a more robust government oversight framework in 2019. The National Security Intelligence Review Agency was created to review the activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the Communications Security Establishment as well as other national agencies and departments like the RCMP and the Canadian Border Services A g enc y .\n\nMore than 40 years ago, the Commission of Inquiry Concerning Certain Activities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (also known as the McDonald Commission ) concluded that security and intelligence agencies in Canada must be assessed on both the effectiveness as well as the conformity with the requirements of democracy. It declared that a responsible government must abide by the rule of law and guarantee the freedom of legitimate political dissent. It made clear that these principles must not be compromised, whittled down or balanced off for the sake of convenience in applying security measures.\n\nIronically, the government may have compromised the McDonald Commission standard in its pursuit of a risk-avoidance counter-terrorism approach. Despite that, there was no desire by the government nor any sustained pressure by the civic society to examine the necessity of these laws, their effectiveness or the potential arbitrariness in their application despite the consequences for individuals, organizations and the country as a whole.\n\nSuch an independent examination and impartial assessment of the antiterrorism laws should be of the same, if not higher, priority than that for the Emergencies Act. This is because, unlike the War Measures Act or the Emergencies Act, the antiterrorism laws are permanent rather than emergency legislations.\n\nArbitrary arrests, no-fly lists, security certificates, citizenship revocations, delisting of charitable organizations, increasing surveillance and deteriorating personal privacy along with the blurring of lines between lawful dissent and illegal activities are part of the legacy of those laws.\n\nThe impact is etched in the memory of many Canadians whose lives were altered due to these laws. For instance, the Iacobucci and O\u2019Connor inquiries provide an account of the effect of inaccurate intelligence sharing practices by Canadian security agencies. Both inquiries exposed the lack of civilian oversight on our national security.\n\nSome people continue to live in limbo under the system of security certificates, which the Supreme Court of Canada ruled unconstitutional. Even when updated to meet the constitutionality test, the court found this regime is more advantageous for the state than criminal proceedings.\n\nCanadian no-fly lists continue to interfere with mobility rights of many Canadians. While the government has not released the number of people enlisted, the number could be as high as 100,000 entries, according to one estimate. However, more than 850 Canadians have been assigned promise codes to avoid no-fly list false flags as of early 2022.\n\nThe effect of antiterrorism laws goes beyond just individuals. They are also responsible for shrinking the public sphere through overregulation and arbitrary and disproportionate targeting of charities. Canadian Muslim charities now face targeted audits from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), just as environmental groups did.\n\nRecently, the taxpayers\u2019 ombudsperson, Fran\u00e7ois Boileau, confirmed that the CRA was obstructing his investigation on the grounds of national security. The CRA\u2019s director general of the charities directorate, Sharmila Khare, admitted at a Senate committee hearing that the framework used for these audits was not established nor created at the CRA. She further asserted that \u201cwe [CRA] are part of a whole-of-government approach when it comes to national security.\u201d\n\nThe denial of access to financial services is also casting a shadow of uncertainty over the charitable sector. Debanking (or de-risking) remains a process that lacks transparency, precision and legal recourse even though it can be triggered by unproven or unsubstantiated allegations. FINTRAC has shown no indication of addressing this problem. Meanwhile, its Australian counterpart, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, completed a consultation process to address the harm from the debanking process and its unintended consequences.\n\nBecause of the extraordinary powers the antiterrorism laws afford governments, they should be subjected to extraordinary scrutiny. To date, this scrutiny is almost non-existent. There was no serious or coherent assessment of these laws to determine if they are necessary and proportionate, nor any attempt to examine their effectiveness against terrorism. Whether they contain appropriate safeguards against abuse or are exercised in a way that is evidence-based and proportionate is still an open question.\n\nThe 2019 New Zealand Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Terrorist Attack on Christchurch Mosques might provide a blueprint for such an undertaking. This inquiry examined the effectiveness of that country\u2019s security agencies and its antiterrorism laws in addressing security threats facing that nation. Among its conclusions was that there was an inappropriate concentration of counterterrorism resources on the threat of \u201cIslamist extremist terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe report concluded this was not based on an informed assessment of the threats associated with other ideologies and it did not come from a system-wide decision of risk analysis. It called for alternative frameworks to address safety and security challenges that were anchored in inclusion and social cohesion.\n\nJustice Rouleau is expected to submit his report on the Emergencies Act by early February. The government is expected to table it in the House of Commons and Senate of Canada before February 20, 2023. It is worth remembering that the deliberative measures contained in the Emergencies Act were an outcome from the McDonald Commission to address the inherent flaws of the War Measures Act.\n\nWorthy of note also is the fact that the War Measures Act was invoked three times during the 20th century in Canada. Twice to arrest and detain \u201cenemy aliens\u201d during the First World War and the Second World War, and more recently during the October Crisis in Quebec in 1970. Canadians look at these episodes in our history with some shame.\n\nIt is time for a similar commission that examines the necessity of the antiterrorism laws, and assesses their effectiveness, and addresses their abuses. The former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada Beverley McLachlin in a speech she gave in New Zealand in 2005 spoke of the Justice Rand principle that governments do not and should not have \u201cabsolute and untrammelled discretion.\u201d Such a discretion may violate the \u201cnorms of fairness\u201d that is the foundation of the rule of law. The antiterrorism laws are unlikely to meet this standard upon any rigorous cross-examination. The findings and recommendations of the Rouleau report could reinvigorate the public concern about government overreach and galvanize support for such an examination."

Liquidity in crypto markets suffered due to the collapse of FTX, while risk assets broadly traded poorly due to continued global monetary tightening. While the outlook remains uncertain, the industry has entered a period of consolidation where companies that build solutions with real world utility will gain the upper hand and survive and thrive through the crypto winter.\n\nMany retail and institutional participants fled to self-custody via on-chain wallets. During this period, Binance remained a large portion of the market by way of liquidity and volumes, and faced several withdrawal cascades (some accounts estimated this at >$12B). However, institutional treasuries, funds and market-makers that traditionally relied on centralized exchange liquidity, sought new venues such as prime brokers, third party custodians and other credit-underwriting parties in order to continue to trade and hold assets in a trustworthy and risk-managed manner. This shift requires exchanges to be far more transparent about their financial stability, and a sufficient reporting mechanism remains to be developed (while some exchanges provided Proof of Reserves, unfortunately those attestations often left more questions than answers due to insufficient disclosures). Market sentiment across all exchanges \u2013 whether audited or unaudited \u2013 is tied to questions of trust. As such, market participants have drastically reduced balances posted to exchanges, increased withdrawal frequency and shortened horizons for most trading strategies, all culminating in a heavy drag on liquidity coupled with volatile prices.\n\nBy the end of Q4 2022, XRP spot markets experienced a general downtrend by way of average daily volumes (ADVs) currently at roughly $700M, down from $1.1B in Q1 2022 (Source: CryptoCompare). This is consistent with crypto more broadly, where in the derivatives market, open interest for BTC was down 15% from Q3 2022 and 30% from Q4 2021 while open interest for ETH was surprisingly more resilient, down less than 10% from Q3 2022 and 25% from Q4 2021. No single centralized exchange has benefitted from this flight to self-custody which underscores just how uncertain the landscape has become. While there were some Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) that have capitalized on this migration, volumes still remained far below their bull-market highs (down >50%) (Source: Dune Analytics).\n\nWhile the market will likely remain fragmented, the industry will see investment activity with a focus on improving core crypto primitives such as payments, custodial services, DEXs and cross-chain user experiences.\n\nGlobal Regulation\n\nThe collapse of FTX is putting pressure on regulators globally to perform greater due diligence and move toward providing regulatory guidelines to the industry. While several jurisdictions, such as the UAE, UK, Switzerland and Singapore, have provided regulatory frameworks for crypto, the US continues to remain distantly behind. Regulatory clarity is required for the industry to grow sustainably and scalably \u2013 something Ripple has long advocated for.\n\nThe SEC continued its campaign of regulation by enforcement without providing clarity to the market. Most recently, the SEC charged Genesis and Gemini with allegedly selling unregistered securities related to their yield products. US banking regulators issued warnings to banks that dealing with cryptocurrencies could expose them to risks such as contagion and fraud due to the lack of oversight and due diligence in the sector. Coinbase settled a case with the New York Department of Financial Services and agreed to pay a $50M fine and invest another $50M in its compliance efforts. In addition, the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against Alex Mashinsky, former CEO and co-founder of Celsius, for defrauding investors.\n\nIn the EU, the final vote for the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill was postponed to April 2023 and Coinbase was granted approval by the Central Bank of Ireland to operate as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP). Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro signed into law the country\u2019s first crypto regulatory framework and Hong Kong reaffirmed its pro-crypto stance as it aims to become a crypto hub.\n\nRipple released its UK policy whitepaper outlining its regulatory ambitions to propel the UK toward global crypto hub status by driving consumer protections, assessing crypto assets according to different risk profiles, and ultimately growing the industry in the UK.\n\nIn 2023, stablecoin regulation will likely be top priority and, in the US, Ripple expects major bills from last term to be reintroduced (e.g., RFIA and DCEA) as Congress seeks to impose tighter controls in the wake of FTX\u2019s demise.\n\nUpdate on the SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple On December 2, Ripple\u2019s reply brief in support of its motion for summary judgment where the company asked the court to grant judgment in the company\u2019s favor was made public. After two years of fighting this lawsuit on behalf of the entire crypto industry and American innovation, the case is fully briefed and Ripple is proud of its defense and feels more confident than ever as it awaits the Judge\u2019s decision. Decision timing is in the Judge\u2019s hands but the company is hopeful to see a ruling in 2023.\n\nXRPL On-chain Activity\n\nOn-Chain Activity Q4 2022 Q3 2022 Q4 2021 Transactions 106,429,153 103,039,261 130,833,193 XRP Burned for Transaction Fees 101,968 146,433 365,701 Avg cost per transaction (in XRP) 0.00096 0.0014 0.0028 Average XRP Closing Price (in USD) 0.42 0.36 1.02 Avg cost per transaction (in USD) 0.000000004 0.000000004 0.000000008 Volume on DEX (in USD) 85,772,947 117,372,932 N/A Trustlines 8,731,628 9,115,964 N/A Number of New Wallets 228,143 125,225 624,368\n\n(Source: XPMarket.com and CoinMarketCap)\n\nDespite a broader market slowdown, on-chain activity on the XRPL stayed relatively buoyant. As trading volumes across the broader market slowed, the number of transactions on the ledger increased by over three million, spurred primarily by NFT activity once the XLS-20 amendment passed on November 2, 2022. Although the number of transactions increased, XRP burned due to transaction fees declined by 33%, and the average cost of a transaction in USD remained virtually zero. During that same period of time, the average transaction fee on the Ethereum network was $2.75 and on the Bitcoin network was $1.23.\n\nXRPL Interoperability\n\nIn Q4, Peersyst announced the release of the first phase of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain for the XRPL on Devnet. This milestone means more developers can easily access the XRPL\u2019s feature set (such as its speed, sustainability and low-cost transactions) while being able to code Solidity-based smart contracts. Additionally this opens the door for successful DeFi applications like Uniswap, Aave and Compound, to easily launch on the XRPL.\n\nGlobal Growth of On-Demand Liquidity Reached Record Highs\n\nRipple remains one of the few crypto firms well capitalized and ready to meet robust customer demand in 2023 head-on by continuing to hire strategically, invest in attractive opportunities and build a platform that can allow traditional institutions to access crypto innovation on the XRPL in a safe and secure fashion.\n\nRipple wrapped up 2022 with its strongest year to date focusing on crypto utility and scaling its ODL product. As RippleNet continues to grow, despite a tumultuous market, Ripple experienced the highest amount of demand from both new and existing customers adopting ODL. Today, Ripple\u2019s crypto-powered payment solution is available in nearly 40 payout markets, up from just three markets in 2020.\n\nLast quarter, ODL was launched in France and Sweden in partnership with payments providers Lemonway and Xbaht respectively, and in Africa via MFS Africa, a leading payments gateway in the region. Additionally, Ripple expanded its customer base to corporates that are looking to experience the benefits of crypto-enabled cross-border payments for their business.\n\nRipple has processed nearly $30B worth of volume and 20M transactions since RippleNet was first launched. In 2022, approximately 60% of those payments were sent through ODL. Disciplined, Responsible Stakeholders: Q4 Sales and Purchases Last quarter, total XRP sales by Ripple, net of purchases, were $226.31M vs. $310.68M in the previous quarter. Ripple has continued to sell XRP only in connection with ODL transactions.\n\nSummary of Ripple\u2019s XRP Sales (dollars in millions) Q3 2022 Q4 2022 Total ODL-related sales* 2,819.63 2,964.28 Total purchases 2,508.95 2,737.97 Net Sales 310.68 226.31\n\nGlobal XRP volume Q3 2022 Q4 2022 ADV XRP (dollars in millions) 789.72 698.45 Total XRP volume (dollars in billions)** 72.65 64.31 Net sales as % of total volume 0.42% 0.35%\n\n*All ODL-related sales are attributed to the growth and adoption of ODL.\n\n**Note: Figures were compiled using the CryptoCompare API for daily TopTier aggregate volumes which reflects total XRP volume in dollars by exchanges that CryptoCompare lists in the TopTier.\n\nRipple has been a buyer of XRP in the secondary market and expects to continue to undertake purchases as ODL continues to gain global momentum.\n\nTotal sales by Ripple, net of purchases, ended the quarter at 0.35% of global XRP volume according to CryptoCompare TopTier (CCTT) volumes.\n\nLeases\n\nCertain wallets used for XRP sales also provide short-term leases to market makers and participants. This is worth noting, given they are often incorrectly interpreted by market participants as sales. XRP associated with leases are ultimately returned to Ripple. The total amount of leases outstanding in Q4 2022 was 57.7 million XRP. Reported Volume and Price\n\nDuring Q4 of 2022, the price of XRP declined 30% along with volumes which declined roughly 40%. ADVs were $689M, down 13% from Q3 2022 and down 64% from Q4 of 2021.\n\nEscrow\n\nIn Q4 2022, three billion XRP were released out of escrow (one billion each month) in line with prior quarters and the official escrow arrangement. In total, 2.1 billion XRP were returned and subsequently put into new escrow contracts throughout the quarter. For more information on the escrow process, see here. Note: All figures are reported based on transactions executed during the quarter.\n\nBuilding with the XRP Ledger Community\n\nTime Magazine Names XRP Ledger Project Best Innovation in 2022 Last year, the Colombian government\u2019s National Land Agency launched a national land registry on the XRP Ledger to store and authenticate Colombian property titles. Developed with Peersyst, the registry recorded its first property in July, and Time Magazine recognized this initiative as one of the \u2018Best Innovations in 2022.\u2019 This unique use case for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) demonstrates the range of utility possible with the XRPL.\n\nXLS-20 is Now Enabled on the XRP Ledger Last quarter, XLS-20 went live on the XRP Ledger Mainnet. This represents a considerable milestone for developers and builders utilizing the XRPL for their native NFTs projects and apps, which can represent assets that are each unique along with operations to enumerate, transfer and hold such tokens.\n\nXRPL-based NFTs were designed with efficiency in mind. Significant transaction expenses are a fundamental problem for developers minting NFTs on other leading layer-1 blockchain solutions. Gas fees can add hundreds of dollars to the final price of an NFT and vary based on a given network\u2019s user traffic and congestion.\n\nNFTs on the XRPL also include automatic royalties which standardize royalty enforcement as one of the benefits of the ledger\u2019s built-in DEX. For creators, NFT transfer fees provide them a share of the revenue when the NFT is bought and sold. They can also designate a third party who mints and sells the tokens on their behalf.\n\nCommunity projects like xDude, Pixel Ape Rowboat Club (PARC), X-Tokenize and XRP Junkies are proof of the excitement and NFT use cases made possible with the XRPL\u2019s low transaction cost and high transaction volume. Since going live, more than 800K NFTs have been minted with 410.6K transacted bringing XRP volume to 12.9 million."
