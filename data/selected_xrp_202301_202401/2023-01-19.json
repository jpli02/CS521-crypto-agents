        "title": "Broad Ripple park debuts a new family center - WFYI",
        "content": "A ribbon cutting ceremony was held today for the new Broad Ripple Park Family Center. The facility took a year and a half to build and has a view of the White River. Center director Kathy Fitzgerald said residents can enjoy the range of recreational options.\n\n\u201cWe have toning and fitness classes and we do not have a weight room,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cBut we are creating an adult fitness area because we purchased, kettlebells, medicine ball smash balls, ropes, and that kind of thing. We're going to try to create an area where people can come and do different things besides just walking on the track.\u201d\n\nIndy Parks will partner with Community Health to provide primary care medical services within the center. One organization, the Broad Ripple Park Alliance opposes the health network\u2019s large illuminated sign. The group says it makes the family center look like a hospital and wants the sign reduced in size.\n\nThe center will host an open house this Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5pm."

Our parks are here for people to enjoy.\u201d\n\nThe family center offers an indoor walking track, gymnasium, group exercise rooms, multipurpose rooms, children\u2019s play area and a group meeting space.\n\n\u201cToday, a beloved Indy park becomes an even better resource for health, community, and recreation,\u201d said Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett. \u201cBroad Ripple Park\u2019s new Family Center joins an ever-increasing list of major upgrades and rebuilds for Indy Parks \u2013 projects that are informed by input from the communities they will serve.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, Indy Parks is partnering with Community Health Network to operate a multi-disciplinary primary care site in the center. There will be pediatricians, family physicians, physical therapy and rehab, X-ray services and a lab.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to partner with Indy Parks and Avenue to promote access to health and fitness,\u201d said Dr. Maureen Sampson, vice president, physician executive at Community Health Network. \u201cWe first began serving the Broad Ripple community nearly 25 years ago when we opened a primary care practice on Broad Ripple Avenue. This new opportunity strengthens our commitment to the Broad Ripple community by allowing us to expand on those services to meet the growing demand of this community.\u201d\n\nDespite the excitement, Broad Ripple Park Alliance voiced concern about the new center for \u201callowing commercial development on park land.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything about this park should be preserved,\u201d said Kathy Rosenberg, who is with the alliance. \u201cIt should be a place for people to enjoy nature and to have peaceful experiences without a business going on.\u201d"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProminent XRP supporter @1CrypticPoet has shared via his Twitter handle that Ripple fintech giant has released a new commercial.\n\nThe video was launched on Ripple's YouTube channel about 18 hours ago with a thousand views so far.\n\nThe description for the video says:\n\nIt's time to build a more efficient, dynamic and transparent financial system. Ripple's crypto solutions empower innovative finance leaders to drive business advantage from crypto today.\n\nThe ad says that the current financial system allows finance to be \"stuck in the same old cycle\" and not move forward.\n\nCrypto solutions, it says then, are transforming finance, make it faster and a lot more efficient than anybody could ever think. With crypto and Ripple in particular, finance is moving into a \"dynamic new era.\"\n\nEarlier Ripple ads and TV commercial\n\nThe previous Ripple TV commercial was launched in 2019 as part of the awareness campaign the crypto giant was conducting back then.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, last year, Ripple's advertisements were also spotted on Wall Street and in the London Tube at Liverpool Street Station. Those advertisements appeared despite the current lawsuit that was started against Ripple by the SEC in December 2020.\n\nBack then, many exchanges paused XRP trading, and some even delisted several XRP-based pairs.\n\nSEC-Ripple lawsuit almost over?\n\nThe beginning of the lawsuit pushed XRP price way down, from the $0.32 level to $0.15 briefly. Currently, the token is changing hands at $0.386. However, the XRP community and Ripple's chief executive Garlinghouse expect the case to be solved this year, probably in the first half of it.\n\nThe CEO has repeated this belief several times during the World Economic Forum in Davos in a few interviews.\n\nPer Garlinghouse, XRP is currently used for running over 50% of all Ripple transactions, of which there are billions every month."

        "title": "We asked ChatGPT if Ripple can win against the SEC; Here's what it said - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "OpenAI\u2019s text-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT has become popular due to its capability to respond to questions in a human-like fashion on a wide range of topics, including the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold asked the ChatGPT chatbot to share expectations on the likely winner of the widely publicized lawsuit in the cryptocurrency sphere, as well as the persuasiveness of the arguments coming from the legal teams of both the regulator and the blockchain company.\n\nWhat did ChatGPT say?\n\nIn response, ChatGPT admitted that it was \u201cdifficult to predict\u201d which of the two sides is likely to win the lawsuit focused on the XRP token sold by Ripple \u201cas the outcome will depend on the evidence presented and the arguments made by both sides.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, however, the AI chatbot also stressed that \u201cRipple\u2019s argument that XRP is not a security is likely to be more persuasive,\u201d further explaining that:\n\n\u201cRipple has argued that XRP is a currency, not a security, and that it is not subject to the same regulations as securities. Ripple has also argued that XRP is decentralized and not controlled by any single entity, which is a key factor in determining whether something is a security or not.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, ChatGPT highlighted the blockchain company\u2019s persistent argument that XRP \u201chas been used for years as a currency and not as an investment, which further supports its argument that XRP is not a security.\u201d\n\nIs ChatGPT correct?\n\nIndeed, defense lawyer and popular commentator on the lawsuit, John E. Deaton, has said that the SEC was overstretching its arguments, drawing attention to the Howey analysis it used to proclaim that XRP was a security \u2013 the test he referred to as \u201cdifficult\u201d to perform for XRP.\n\nHe also drew attention to the 3,000 affidavits indicating that the first-time XRP buyers weren\u2019t even aware of Ripple\u2019s existence, as well as that they purchased the token for non-investment reasons, receiving benefits from XRP completely independent of Ripple.\n\nMeanwhile, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is optimistic about the outcome of the case, both in terms of the judgment itself and its timeline, voicing his expectations that the SEC case would be concluded in 2023, perhaps even in the first half of the year, as Finbold reported.\n\nElsewhere, Google searches involving the keyword \u2018ChatGPT\u2019 have soared in January, with China dominating as the region with the highest search interest in the AI tool, whereas in the United States, it hasn\u2019t yet recorded such a drastic increase in popularity."

        "title": "The play 'the ripple, the wave that carried me home' at Goodman Theatre has much to say about politics, heritage and ... - Chicago Tribune",
        "content": "Water. We can\u2019t seem to get away from it, living so close to Lake Michigan in the Chicagoland.\n\nDuring this past holiday season, \u201cLake Song\u201d was an audio drama that centered water and Chicago and came to life with the myriad voices of Chicagoans. Now, the Goodman is featuring \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home,\u201d a work by Christina Anderson that won the 2022 Horton Foote Prize for a playwright, in a co-production with the Berkeley Repertory Theatre. The play is about a Black family fighting for the integration of public swimming pools in Kansas in the 1960s. The narrative features Janice, the child of activist parents, who has grown apart from her family through the years, only to have to return to her hometown to honor her father\u2019s work. Racial justice, political legacy and family forgiveness are all themes in the story, as Janice (played by Chicago native Christiana Clark) decides to deal with her past that she has compartmentalized away from her life and current family.\n\nPlaywright Christina Anderson on the set of \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home\u201d at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago.\n\nWe caught up with Anderson and Clark during a technical rehearsal of the play to talk about political inheritance, going home again, and the history of water and Black bodies in our country. The following has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nQ: This play talks about political inheritance. What is our responsibility to legacy and heritage and keeping it going?\n\nAnderson: I deal with a lot of political, social, cultural aspects across my body of work. I\u2019m very interested in American history, and how we as a culture tend to repeat things. The lessons that we fail to learn and the consequences of that, but also the lessons that we do learn and the celebrations of that. I\u2019m always interested particularly in Black women and how they navigate American politics. And even though I use these terms \u2014 politics and social and cultural, I\u2019m still very committed to character and who these people are specifically and how they navigate the world. I\u2019m very interested in balancing real life people. And even though I lean into poetry with a lot of my work, and into Black folks\u2019 relationship with the police \u2026 I like to think of myself as someone who writes dramedies. I\u2019m interested in history and how to articulate that and how to watch people navigate that. But also staying true to life because there\u2019s a lot of humor in life, but there\u2019s also a lot of tragedy and darkness and how we, as humans can still survive and thrive in that.\n\nQ: Going home again is an aspect in this play. There\u2019s revelations, secrets, a certain element of forgiveness. Is forgiveness and grace always a theme in your work?\n\nAnderson: To some degree, yes. And within that, really exploring who\u2019s seeking it (forgiveness) and who is denied it. Because I think in a lot of ways, so many of us are grateful when we receive that grace. A lot of my characters are trying to build and maintain relationships. And sometimes they fail at that. But sometimes they succeed. I had a friend who always said people come into your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. And I feel that a lot of the people who populate my plays experience different elements of that. People can come in and change your life in a week or they can change your life in half a century. Those are things that I\u2019m exploring, definitely.\n\nAneisa Hicks, playing the role of Helen, and Ronald L. Conner, playing the role of Edwin, rehearse for \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home\u201d at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago.\n\nQ: The character Janice, is she conflicted in her relationship with her parents because she felt her childhood was slighted?\n\nAnderson: That\u2019s a part of it. I don\u2019t want to give it away any spoiler alerts because I would like for you to have a unique experience where you come to see it, but the other aspect of this show and something I\u2019ve always been fascinated in is the children of activists. I have a very good friend whose mother worked closely with the Black Panther Party, and he was saying that he has vivid memories when he was 5 or 6 years old where he\u2019d come out of his bedroom and see three Black men sitting in the living room and his mother is hiding them out. She\u2019s telling him when you go to school, don\u2019t talk about these dudes, and he would often say: \u201cWhen I\u2019d wake up in the day I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d have my mother or I\u2019d have the activist,\u201d and that notion always stuck with me. With Janice, the inner conflict that she\u2019s wrestling with is as this Black woman she can understand how important the fight is. But what does that mean for her and her parents and the sacrifices they made at home? Over the course of the play, they as a family have some intense events happen that they didn\u2019t talk about and that had a real effect on their relationship as a family. In the community and in the local press of that town, Janice feels that her parents knew how to be the face and how to be communicative and articulate in the fight, but at home there\u2019s a lot of silence that happens around these events. In a sense, Janice feels like her parents were consistently choosing the movement, but not necessarily the family. And she carries the responsibility for not knowing how to fix it. It\u2019s complicated relations. I\u2019m super grateful for Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Black Lives Matter and the history of activists that we\u2019ve had in this country, but I acknowledge that there is a great deal of sacrifice when you do that type of work, especially the type of activism where you\u2019re physically putting yourself in spaces, in the press and out in the world. That\u2019s the thing that Janice is wrestling with.\n\nQ: As an individual and Chicagoan, were you aware of the amount of history surrounding water and the Black body before this play?\n\nClark: I feel like I had the information of the experience as a Black person in America. My parents grew up in Chicago, they swam. I remember hearing about them swimming in high school, they both went to Hirsch. My dad\u2019s sister, if I\u2019m not mistaken, was on the swim team. But the knowledge of the segregation of pools \u2026 I don\u2019t know so much that it came from school, it came from family. I\u2019m excited for sharing the story for those who are in the know and for those who are not. For some, it\u2019s a beautiful honoring and validation of stories. And for others, it\u2019s a chance to shed a light and put in greater context things we think about when there\u2019s stereotypes of Black people not knowing how to swim, Black people being afraid of the water, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get my hair wet\u201d \u2014 all that stuff. When you open up and have context of societal reasons and reasons of law that were placed on us, that limited access, that does so much for speaking of things that ripple and are handed down through generations. It\u2019s a history that I\u2019m surprised more people aren\u2019t aware of. But I feel like the more I live on this Earth and in this country, surprise starts to go away.\n\nAneisa Hicks, playing the role of Helen, and Christiana Clark, right, playing the role of Janice rehearse for \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home\u201d at the Goodman Theatre.\n\nQ: Water is life, and in the play\u2019s program, there is a brief history of the racial politics surrounding public pools. Do you think the Black community can move past the historical trauma that exists around water in this country?\n\nAnderson: I hope we can get past it. I\u2019ve been working on this play for a couple of years and I end up having a lot of different conversations around swimming and water with a lot of different types of people. But the one consistent thing that I keep hearing from lots of people is how swimming can be a form of peace and relaxation. And it\u2019s also very meditative and spiritual. I want, hope, and wish that for Black folks, to have that kind of access because I think it\u2019s very important.\n\nQ: What are we, as outsiders looking at your work, missing from your process of world building?\n\nAnderson: I\u2019m very inspired by Black women artists who created bodies of work, and women in general. Paula Vogel is a mentor who I now consider a friend. The same with Lynn Nottage, and I\u2019m an eternal fan of Ntozake Shange. I would encourage people to consider the body of work that I\u2019m making, because each play is its own world.\n\nChristiana Clark, playing the role of Janice, rehearses for \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home\u201d at the Goodman Theatre on Jan. 12, 2023.\n\nQ: It\u2019s been over two years since the letter to white American theater was penned and delivered. Have you seen or felt a difference in the landscape, as an artist?\n\nClark: In the face of perceived \u2018we\u2019re all woke now and we all see it,\u2019 there\u2019s so much work to do. There\u2019s so much at the root institutionally that has not allowed opportunity, that has deemed work by Black artists less than, that has upheld what had been in mind of the cannon or the classics that were predominantly, if not all, Eurocentric and one year\u2019s focus is not going to bring the change to an institution like the American Theatre. I think it has brought more opportunity right now for a lot of Black artists and Black artist leaders. They are doing incredibly hard work but it\u2019s hard work that\u2019s up against boards and established systems and mindsets of what sells and everybody\u2019s in a financial hardship now \u2014 we have to make money. I believe that we are in the growing pain phases of establishing this change, that can bring Black artists and other artists of color, to a better equity among this landscape. But it\u2019s more than just putting Black stories on stage. It is changing things in boards, it is changing our audiences \u2014 because I\u2019ve had the experiences of doing a play like \u201cripple\u201d where there were audiences all white. Being in a place, being vulnerable, telling our stories, takes something away from you when constantly sharing our stories, but we\u2019re not there to receive them. There\u2019s much work to be done to develop Black audiences, to invest in critics who are being able to watch and take in what they\u2019re saying. People are really facing the fact that it is more than just assigning this artistic director or plotting this play. It\u2019s a deeper work that requires coming to communities as opposed to expecting them to show up.\n\n\u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home\u201d opens Jan. 23 and runs through Feb. 12 at the Goodman Theatre, 170 N. Dearborn St.; tickets ($15-$45) at 312-443-3800 and GoodmanTheatre.org/Ripple\n\ndrockett@chicagotribune.com"
