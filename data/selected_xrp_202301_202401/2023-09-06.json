        "content": "Update: As of December 31, 2023, both the $50k Ripple Maui Match and $500k Maui Emergency Response Fund Match have been fully exhausted. Thank you for your generosity!\n\nThey say good things come in threes, and the pattern holds true today. First, we\u2019re very excited to announce that support for XRP charitable donations is now live on The Giving Block.\n\nWhile this is already news to celebrate for the thousands of nonprofits using our fundraising tools, there\u2019s more: the generous folks at Ripple have marked the occasion by matching the next $50,000 in donations to our Maui Emergency Response Fund. Added up, that\u2019s a total of $100,000 in philanthropic impact.\n\nBut why stop there? Those donations will also be matched yet again thanks to another active initiative from Jared Isaacman, CEO of Shift4 (our parent company).\n\nThat brings us to a grand total of $150,000 in potential giving, all stemming from the generosity of our friends at Ripple.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of exciting news for one announcement, so we\u2019ll unpack it all below, piece by piece:"
