        "content": "Ripple's CEO chose to fight the charges instead of settling, as most other projects have done before. The legal battle has been ongoing for three years, and judging from the current situation, Ripple will likely emerge as the winner. If that happens, Ripple will clear its name, motivating investors in mass to adopt the platform's unique global payments system. Moreover, XRP tokens will be fully legalized and regulated, just like Bitcoin, making XRP one of the most trusted cryptos on the market."

        "title": "Lakers News: How Chris Paul's Future In Phoenix Can Have A Ripple Effect On LA - Sports Illustrated",
        "content": "What will become of the future Hall of Famer this year?\n\nThe on-court production of 38-year-old Phoenix Suns starting point guard Chris Paul seems to finally, truly be on permanent decline at this point. No shade is intended in stating this, it's just simple fact. He has gotten hurt or sick during the playoffs across all three of his seasons with Phoenix thus far.\n\nNews broke last week that Paul could be waived by the Suns. Later, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN and Shams Charania of The Athletic revealed that perhaps rumors of CP3's getting cut were a bit preemptive. Lakers head coach-turned-Suns head coach Frank Vogel later confirmed as much.\n\nInstead, it appears that the Suns are weighing their various options when it comes to Paul's future. One route for roster building would see the team guarantee his money and try to trade him.\n\nPaul is owed $30.8 million in 2023-24, but that number is only partially guaranteed until June 28th. The Suns could waive him ahead of that deadline, and would thus only owe him $15.8 million of that deal (which would not be counted against the team's books). Should he clear waivers, Paul would become an unrestricted free agent, and could even re-sign with the Suns if he so chose, likely for a veteran's minimum deal in the vicinity of $3 million.\n\nThe Suns could also waive Paul's contract and stretch out his $15.8 million guarantee over the course of five years, which would give Phoenix $12 million in available cap space this season (plus its mid-level exception).\n\nThe 12-time All-Star and first ballot Hall of Famer has had a storied run across his 18 years in the league, and remains a high-level playmaker and defender, even if his shooting and availability have taken a dip of late.\n\nJake Fischer of Yahoo Sports notes that current Los Angeles Lakers point guard D'Angelo Russell, who will become an unrestricted free agent if he doesn't agree to an extension before July 1st, was floated as a potential target for the Suns as late as last years' trade deadline, while he was still with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nFischer wonders if a sign-and-trade of Russell for Paul's contract could benefit both teams.\n\n\"Russell is known to be close friends with [Suns All-Star shooting guard Devin] Booker,\" Fischer writes. \"Plus, the Lakers are said to be exploring similar sign-and-trade possibilities with Russell. For Los Angeles and Phoenix, losing Russell by free agency or waiving Paul would sacrifice a $30 million salary slot that feels all the more precious while staring down a daunting new second tax apron in the league\u2019s upcoming collective bargaining agreement. These decisions are not ones to make on a whim, and that\u2019s why Phoenix and Paul have begun discussing different alternatives roughly three weeks before free agency begins.\"\n\nAre you following us on Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube yet?

        "content": "Bitcoin price could make a 5% run to the supply zone at $29,000 if it successfully shatters the $28,096 barricade.\n\nEthereum price has the $1,674 resistance level in sight with a buy signal pending activation.\n\nRipple price on a one-way trip to $0.5604 as XRP holds above an ascending trendline.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is showing some degree of optimism ahead of the weekend, with the same narrative going for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (EXRP). It all points to fired-up bulls as volatility resumes in the market. It is also a sign to exercise caution to avoid being caught in a bulltrap.\n\nAlso Read: @Satoshi X account tweets for first time in 5 years, touts Bitcoin as a predicate machine\n\nBitcoin price eyes 5% gains to the supply zone\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price recovery rally continues after bouncing from the $25,114 around mid-September. It is currently testing the $28,096 hurdle after multiple failed attempts while enjoying strong support from below due to the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $27,350.\n\nIf Bitcoin price breaks and shatters the $28,096 hurdle, it could climb 5% to the supply zone at the $29,000 psychological level. A decisive flip of this resistance zone into a bullish breaker would clear the path into the $30,000 psychological level, or in highly bullish cases, extend to the range high at $31,508. This would denote a 13% move above current levels.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) looks primed to continue north while sustaining above 50. Meanwhile, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in the positive zone, increasing BTC\u2019s upside potential.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, after multiple rejections from the $28,096 hurdle, Bitcoin price could pull back as skeptics cut their losses. This could send BTC below the 100-day EMA at $27,349, or lower to lose the 50- and 200-day EMA at $27,054 and $26,990 levels respectively.\n\nIn the dire case, a retest of the $26,000 psychological level would seem logical. This would not only invalidate the bullish thesis, but could kickstart a fresh downtrend to test the $25,114 support floor.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price will likely hit $22,800 before 2024 should it follow its nine-year pattern\n\nEthereum price awaits pending buy signal\n\nEthereum (ETH) price could climb 5% to the $1,674 resistance level as it awaits the activation of a buy signal. This would happen once the RSI decisively crosses above the signal line (yellow band).\n\nTraders heeding this call could see ETH shatter the immediate hurdle at $1,648. In highly bullish cases, the gains could see Ethereum price overcome the 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMA at 1,664, $1,710, and $1,729 before clearing the equal highs at $1,736.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a rejection from the $1,648 barrier could plunge Ethereum price into the demand zone between the $1,603 and $1,569 order block. A break and cross below the midline of this zone at $1,585 would invalidate the bullish thesis, potentially sending the Proof-of-Stake token to the $1,551 range low.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price dip extends, liquidates $10 million in long positions as exchange outflows skyrocket"

        "title": "The Ripple Effect of a Decline in Housing Starts - Pro Builder",
        "content": "Higher interest rates and rising prices will translate into a decrease in housing starts in key counties around the U.S., according to a recent report by market forecasting firm Senex. The result will be a multi-billion-dollar drop-off in revenues in categories ranging from appliances to heating and cooling equipment to windows.\n\nThe twist in the tale: 80% of the declines in starts will be concentrated in just 284 of the more than 3,100 total counties across the U.S. A full 50% of the declines will be concentrated in a mere 65 of those counties.\n\nThe lesson here? Movements in a relatively small number of key markets around the country have an outsized impact on the performance of the overall domestic housing sector, either for good or for ill.\n\nRELATED\n\nCounty-Level Housing Starts Data\n\nThe latest numbers are staggering. For example, of the total 202,000-unit projected decline in single-family housing starts, those 284 counties will account for 161,600 of them.\n\nThose counties also will account for $51.2 billion of the total $64 billion in lost revenue the housing sector will suffer this year. The remaining $12.8 billion in losses will be spread over the remaining 2,928 counties. To put these numbers into perspective, the total gross domestic product (GDP) of Montana in 2022 was $65 billion.\n\nAs for the rest of the U.S., the remaining 2,861 counties will definitely experience fewer starts, but will only average a decline of about 20 units each. The map below illustrates the concentration of single-family construction in U.S. counties. Darker shaded counties will experience the biggest declines. Unsurprisingly, the hardest hit counties also happen to be the same ones that benefitted from most of the growth during the past three years.\n\nMost of the counties represented here are found in states where building has comprised half of all starts in past years. These 10 states will account for more than 136,000 fewer starts in 2023, which obviously translates into a much bigger hit to each state\u2019s economic growth and tax revenue.\n\nThis \"heat map\" of U.S. counties shows their estimated declines in single-family housing starts this year.\n\nSenex estimates a continued decline in housing starts through 2024.\n\nImpact on Pricing and Materials Costs in Home Building\n\nTrace all that money backward from the point of sale to the installers, dealers, distributors, manufacturers, and raw materials suppliers and it\u2019s easy to see why so many housing sector workers\u2014especially the ones serving these critical markets\u2014are looking to the future with concern.\n\nAn analysis of these individual markets provides a clearer picture of what higher interest rates and the rising costs of doing business have done to builders, manufacturers, and others affected by the shifts.\n\nAccording to the latest U.S. Census Bureau data, the average sales price of a new home in April 2023 was $501,000. Our estimate\u2014based on discussions with home builders and other research sources\u2014is that it costs $315,000 to build an average-priced home, excluding land and related fees.\n\nRELATED\n\nBuilders also told us they are currently seeing, and are budgeting for, even higher prices for building products and materials. Carlos Fulton, a custom builder in Dallas, says costs for his new homes are going up even as demand is falling. \u201cIt\u2019s not like prices are falling for me where I can pass along savings to my buyers through a lower sales price,\u201d he says. \u201cThey just keep going higher.\u201d\n\nSenex validates his experience. Our numbers predict, at least through May of 2023, the estimated cost-to-build is going to climb despite falling demand for new homes.\n\nThat means there will be no relief in the short term for the ailing housing sector. Here's a sense for just how many dollars will disappear in various product categories with the predicted drop in single-family construction: The HVAC segment will lose $2.3 billion in revenue, followed by windows (\u2013$1.5 billion), major appliances (\u2013$700 million), toilets (\u2013$615 million), kitchen and bath faucets (\u2013$465 million), and doors (\u2013$250 million)."

        "title": "The Ripple Effects of Japanese American Reparations - The Atlantic",
        "content": "In 1990, the U.S. government began mailing out envelopes, each containing a presidential letter of apology and a $20,000 check from the Treasury, to more than 82,000 Japanese Americans who, during World War II, were robbed of their homes, jobs, and rights, and incarcerated in camps. This effort, which took a decade to complete, remains a rare attempt to make reparations to a group of Americans harmed by force of law. We know how some recipients used their payment: The actor George Takei donated his redress check to the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. A former incarceree named Mae Kanazawa Hara told an interviewer in 2004 that she bought an organ for her church in Madison, Wisconsin. Nikki Nojima Louis, a playwright, told me earlier this year that she used the money to pay for living expenses while pursuing her doctorate in creative writing at Florida State University. She was 65 when she decided to go back to school, and the money enabled her to move across the country from her Seattle home.\n\nBut many stories could be lost to history. My family received reparations. My grandfather, Melvin, was 6 when he was imprisoned in Tule Lake, California. As long as I\u2019ve known about the redress effort, I\u2019ve wondered how he felt about getting a check in the mail decades after the war. No one in my family knows how he used the money. Because he died shortly after I was born, I never had a chance to ask.\n\nThe author\u2019s grandfather (second from left) and other family members when they were incarcerated at Tule Lake (Courtesy of Morgan Ome)\n\nTo my knowledge, no one has rigorously studied how families spent individual payments, each worth $45,000 in current dollars. Densho, a nonprofit specializing in archival history of Japanese American incarceration, and the Japanese American National Museum confirmed my suspicions. When I first started researching what the redress effort did for former incarcerees, the question seemed almost impudent, because whose business was it but theirs what they did with the money?\n\nStill, I thought, following that money could help answer a basic question: What did reparations mean for the recipients? When I began my reporting, I expected former incarcerees and their descendants to speak positively about the redress movement. What surprised me was how intimate the experience turned out to be for so many. They didn\u2019t just get a check in the mail; they got some of their dignity and agency back. Also striking was how interviewee after interviewee portrayed the monetary payments as only one part\u2014though an important one\u2014of a broader effort at healing.\n\nFrom the June 2014 issue: The case for reparations\n\nThe significance of reparations becomes all the more important as cities, states, and some federal lawmakers grapple with whether and how to make amends to other victims of official discrimination\u2014most notably Black Americans. Although discussions of compensation have existed since the end of the Civil War, they have only grown in intensity and urgency in recent years, especially after this magazine published Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d in 2014. In my home state, California, a task force has spent the past three years studying what restitution for Black residents would look like. The task force will deliver its final recommendations\u2014which reportedly include direct monetary payments and a formal apology to descendants of enslaved people\u2014to the state legislature by July 1.\n\nIn 1998, as redress for Japanese American incarcerees was winding to a close, the University of Hawaii law professor Eric Yamamoto wrote, \u201cIn every African American reparations publication, in every legal argument, in almost every discussion, the topic of Japanese American redress surfaces. Sometimes as legal precedent. Sometimes as moral compass. Sometimes as political guide.\u201d Long after it ended, the Japanese American\u2013redress program illustrates how honest attempts at atonement for unjust losses cascade across the decades.\n\nIn February 1942, following the attacks on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the incarceration of more than 125,000 Japanese Americans mostly on the West Coast. In the most famous challenge to the legality of Roosevelt\u2019s order, Fred Korematsu, an Oakland man who had refused to report for incarceration, appealed his conviction for defying military orders. The Supreme Court upheld Korematsu\u2019s conviction in its now notorious decision Korematsu v. United States. Families like mine were forced to abandon everything, taking only what they could carry.\n\nAfter the war, many former incarcerees, weighed down with guilt and shame, refused to speak about their experience. But as their children\u2014many of them third-generation Japanese Americans\u2014came of age during the civil-rights movement, calls for restitution and apology grew within the community. In 1980, Congress passed legislation establishing a commission to study the issue and recommend appropriate remedies. After hearing testimony from more than 500 Japanese Americans\u2014many of whom were speaking of their incarceration for the first time\u2014the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians concluded that \u201crace prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership\u201d had been the primary motivators for the incarceration. The CWRIC also recommended that $20,000 be paid to each survivor of the camps.\n\nAt the same time, new evidence emerged showing that the government had suppressed information and lied about Japanese Americans being security threats. In the 1980s, lawyers reopened the Korematsu case and two similar challenges to E.O. 9066. All three convictions were vacated. By 1988, when reparations legislation was making its way through Congress, the legal proceedings and the CWRIC\u2019s findings provided the momentum and public evidence for Japanese Americans to make the case for reparations. The 1988 Civil Liberties Act authorized reparations checks to all Japanese American incarcerees who were alive the day the act was signed into law. (If a recipient was deceased at the time of payment, the money went to their immediate family). The Department of Justice established a special body, the Office of Redress Administration, to contact and verify eligible recipients. The CLA also provided for a formal government apology and a fund to educate the public about the incarceration: safeguards against such history repeating itself.\n\nRead: Two Boy Scouts met in an internment camp, and grew up to work in Congress\n\nEver since, reparations advocates have invoked Japanese American redress as a precedent that can be replicated for other groups. Dreisen Heath, a reparations advocate and former researcher at Human Rights Watch, told me Japanese American redress proves that \u201cit is possible for the U.S. government to not only acknowledge and formally apologize and state its culpability for a crime, but also provide some type of compensation.\u201d In 1989, then-Representative John Conyers introduced H.R. 40, a bill to establish a commission to study reparations for Black Americans. Proponents have reintroduced the bill again and again.\n\nIn 2021, as the House Judiciary Committee prepared to vote for the first time on H.R. 40, the Japanese American social-justice organization Tsuru for Solidarity submitted to the panel more than 300 letters written by former incarcerees and their descendants. The letters described how the reparations process helped Japanese Americans, psychologically and materially, in ways that stretched across generations. (In addition to drawing on that rich source of information for this story, I also interviewed family friends, members of the Japanese American church that I grew up in, and other former incarcerees and their children.)\n\nIn one of the letters, the daughter of an incarceree tells how the $20,000, invested in her family\u2019s home equity and compounded over time, ultimately enabled her to attend Yale. \u201cThe redress money my family received has always been a tailwind at my back, making each step of the way a tiny bit easier,\u201d she wrote. Just as her family was able to build generational equity, she hoped that Black Americans, too, would have \u201cthe choice to invest in education, homeownership, or whatever else they know will benefit their families, and, through the additional choices that wealth provides, to be a little more free.\u201d\n\nThe redress effort for World War II incarcerees has shaped California\u2019s task force in highly personal ways. Lisa Holder, an attorney who sits on the task force, first saw the idea of reparations become concrete through her best friend in high school, whose Japanese American father received a payment. The only non-Black member of the task force is the civil-rights lawyer Don Tamaki, whose parents were both incarcerated. Tamaki, like many other people I interviewed, acknowledges that incarcerees have different histories and experiences from the victims of slavery and Jim Crow\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s no equivalence between what Japanese Americans suffered and what Black people have gone through,\u201d he told me\u2014but he also sees some parallels that might inform the reparations debate.\n\nTamaki\u2019s life, like that of many Japanese Americans, has been shaped by his family\u2019s incarceration. As a young lawyer, he worked on the legal team that reopened Korematsu. Tamaki is now 72. In January, he and I met at the Shops at Tanforan, a mall built atop the land where his parents, Minoru and Iyo, were incarcerated. Next to the mall, a newly opened memorial plaza honors the nearly 8,000 people of Japanese descent who lived there in 1942. Neither Don nor I had previously visited the memorial, which happens to be near my hometown. In middle school, I bought a dress for a dance party at the mall\u2019s JCPenney.\n\nIn 1942, Tanforan was an equestrian racetrack. After Roosevelt issued his internment order, horse stalls were hastily converted into living quarters. Minoru, who was in his last year of pharmacy school, couldn\u2019t attend his commencement ceremony, because he was incarcerated. The university instead rolled up the diploma in a tube addressed to Barrack 80, Apt. 5, Tanforan Assembly Centre, San Bruno, California. \u201cThe diploma represents the promise of America,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd the mailing tube which wraps around this promise\u2014the diploma\u2014constrains and restricts it.\u201d Don still has both.\n\nWhen the checks arrived in the mail in the \u201990s, the Tamakis gathered at Don\u2019s house. His parents spent one check on a brown Mazda MPV, which they would use while babysitting their grandkids. They put the other check into savings. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do anything extravagant,\u201d Don told me.\n\nTo talk about reparations is to talk about loss: of property and of personhood. In 1983, the CWRIC estimated Japanese American incarcerees\u2019 economic losses at $6 billion, approximately $18 billion today. But those figures don\u2019t capture the dreams, opportunities, and dignity that were taken from people during the war. Surviving incarcerees still feel those losses deeply.\n\nRead: What my grandmother learned in her World War II internment camp\n\nMary Tamura, 99, was a resident of Terminal Island off the coast of Los Angeles. \u201cIt was like living in Japan,\u201d she told me. Along with the island\u2019s 3,000 other Japanese American residents, she celebrated Japanese holidays; learned the art of flower arranging, ikebana; and wore kimonos. Then, on December 7, 1941, shortly after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the FBI rounded up men and community leaders, including Tamura\u2019s father. Two months later, Terminal Island residents were ordered to leave within 48 hours. Tamura, who once dreamed of teaching, instead joined the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps. On Terminal Island, Japanese homes and businesses were razed.\n\nLily Shibuya was born in 1938 in San Juan Bautista, California. After the war, her family moved to Mountain View, where they grew carnations. Shibuya\u2019s older siblings couldn\u2019t afford to go to college and instead started working immediately after they were released from one of the camps. Her husband\u2019s family members, also flower growers, were able to preserve their farmland but lost the chrysanthemum varieties they had cultivated.\n\nShibuya told me that with her reparations check, she bought a funerary niche for herself, paid for her daughter\u2019s wedding, and covered travel expenses to attend her son\u2019s medical-school graduation. Tamura used part of her redress money for a vacation to Europe with her husband. The other funds went toward cosmetic eyelid surgery. \u201cIt was just for beauty\u2019s sake\u2014vanity,\u201d Tamura told me.\n\nMany recipients felt moved to use the $20,000 payments altruistically. In a 2004 interview with Densho, the then-91-year-old Mae Kanazawa Hara\u2014who\u2019d given an organ to her church\u2014recalled her reaction to receiving reparations: \u201cI was kind of stunned. I said, \u2018By golly, I\u2019ve never had a check that amount.\u2019 I thought, Oh, this money is very special.\u201d Some recipients gave their check to their children or grandchildren, feeling that it should go toward future generations.\n\nThe notion that recipients should use their money for noble purposes runs deep in the discussion about reparations. It helps explain why some reparations proposals end up looking more like public-policy initiatives than the unrestricted monetary payments that Japanese Americans received. For example, a 2021 initiative in Evanston, Illinois, began providing $25,000 in home repairs or down-payment assistance to Black residents and their descendants who experienced housing discrimination in the city from 1919 to 1969. Florida provides free tuition to state universities for the descendants of Black families in the town of Rosewood who were victimized during a 1923 massacre. But if the goal of reparations is to help restore dignity and opportunity, then the recipients need autonomy. Only they can decide how best to spend those funds. (Perhaps recognizing this, Evanston\u2019s city council voted earlier this year to provide direct cash payments of $25,000.)\n\nIbram X. Kendi: There is no middle ground on reparations\n\nNot every Japanese American whom I interviewed deemed the reparations effort helpful or sincere. When I arrived at Mary Murakami\u2019s home in Bethesda, Maryland, the 96-year-old invited me to sit at her dining-room table, where she had laid out several documents in preparation for my visit: her yearbook from the high school she graduated from while incarcerated; a map of the barracks where she lived in Topaz, Utah; a movie poster\u2013size copy of Executive Order 9066, found by her son-in-law at an antique shop.\n\nShe first saw the order nailed to a telephone pole in San Francisco\u2019s Japantown as a high schooler, more than 80 years ago. A rumor had been circulating in Japantown that children might be separated from their parents. Her mother and father gave each child a photo of themselves, so the children would remember who their parents were. They also revealed a family secret: Atop the highest shelf in one of their closets sat an iron box. The children had never asked about it, and it was too heavy for any of them to remove, Murakami recalled. Inside the box was an urn containing the ashes of her father\u2019s first wife, the mother of Murakami\u2019s oldest sister, Lily.\n\nThe government had told them to take only what they could carry. The ashes of a dead woman would have to be left behind. Murakami and her father buried the box in a cemetery outside the city. With no time or money to prepare a proper tombstone, they stuck a homemade wooden marker in the ground. Then they returned home to resume packing. They sold all their furniture\u2014enough to fill seven rooms\u2014for $50.\n\nMurakami\u2019s family, like the Tamakis, went to Tanforan, and then to Topaz. \u201cThe most upsetting thing about camp was the family unity breaking down,\u201d Murakami told me. \u201cAs camp life went on, we didn\u2019t eat with our parents most of the time.\u201d Not that she did much eating\u2014she recalls the food as inedible, save for the plain peanut-and-apple-butter sandwiches. Today, Murakami will not eat apple butter or allow it in her house.\n\nAfter the war, she did her best to move forward. She graduated from UC Berkeley, where she met her husband, Raymond. They moved to Washington, D.C., so that he could attend dental school at Howard University\u2014a historically Black school that she and her husband knew would admit Japanese Americans.\n\nAbsent from the documents that Murakami saved is the presidential letter of apology. \u201cBoth Ray and I threw it away,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe thought it came too late.\u201d After the war ended, each incarceree was given $25 and a one-way ticket to leave the camps. For Murakami, money and an apology would have meant something when her family was struggling to resume the life that they had been forced to abruptly put on pause\u2014not more than 40 years later. She and her husband gave some of their reparations to their children. Raymond donated his remaining funds to building the Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism in Washington, D.C., and Mary deposited hers in a retirement fund.\n\nA $20,000 check could not reestablish lost flower fields, nor could it resurrect a formerly proud and vibrant community. Still, the money, coupled with an official apology, helped alleviate the psychological anguish that many incarcerees endured. Lorraine Bannai, who worked on Fred Korematsu\u2019s legal team alongside Don Tamaki, almost never talked with her parents about the incarceration. Yet, after receiving reparations, her mother confided that she had lived under a cloud of guilt for decades, and it had finally been lifted. \u201cMy reaction was: \u2018You weren\u2019t guilty of anything. How could you think that?\u2019\u201d Bannai told me. \u201cBut on reflection, of course she would think that. She was put behind barbed wire and imprisoned.\u201d\n\nYamamoto, the law professor in Hawaii, stresses that the aims of reparations are not simply to compensate victims but to repair and heal their relationship with society at large. Kenniss Henry, a national co-chair of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, told me that her own view of reparations has evolved over time. She sees value in processes such as community hearings and reports documenting a state\u2019s history of harm. \u201cIt is necessary to have some form of direct payment, but reparations represent more than just a check,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Los Angeles community organizer Miya Iwataki, who worked toward Japanese American redress as a congressional staffer in the 1980s and now advocates for reparations for Black Californians, sees the checks and apology to World War II incarcerees as essential parts of a larger reconciliation. In 2011, Iwataki accompanied her father, Kuwashi, to Washington, D.C., to receive a Congressional Gold Medal for his World War II military service. Throughout their trip, he was greeted by strangers who knew of Kuwashi\u2019s unit: the all-Japanese 100th Battalion of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, known for being the most decorated unit of its size and length of service. As the Iwatakis settled into their seats on the return flight, Kuwashi told Miya, \u201cThis is the first time I really felt like an American.\u201d\n\nThe author\u2019s grandfather (far left) and family during World War II (Courtesy of Morgan Ome)\n\nFor decades, former incarcerees have kept memories alive, and now that task falls to their descendants. Pilgrimages to former incarceration sites have resumed since the height of the pandemic, and new memorials, like the one at the Tanforan mall, continue to crop up. \u201cThe legacy of Japanese American incarceration and redress has yet to be written,\u201d Yamamoto told me.\n\nIn January, my mom and I drove to Los Angeles for an appointment at the Japanese American National Museum. We were there to see the Ireich\u014d, or the sacred book of names. The memorial arose out of another previously unanswered question: How many Japanese Americans in total were incarcerated during the war? For three years, the Ireich\u014d\u2019s creator, Duncan Ry\u016bken Williams, worked with volunteers and researchers to compile the first comprehensive list, with 125,284 names printed on 1,000 pages.\n\nI was stunned at the book\u2019s size, and even more moved by the memorial\u2019s design. On the walls hung wood panels with the names of each incarceration camp written in Japanese and English, along with a glass vial of soil from each site. My mom and I were invited to stamp a blue dot next to the names of our family members, as a physical marker of remembrance. When the museum docent flipped to my grandfather, Melvin, I was reminded that I\u2019ll never be able to ask him what he experienced as a child. I\u2019ll never learn what he thought when, in his 50s, he opened his apology letter. The only additional detail that I learned about him while reporting this article was that, according to my grandmother, he mistakenly listed the $20,000 as income on his tax return.\n\nBut through my conversations with surviving incarcerees, many of whose names also appear in the Ireich\u014d, I could see how a combination of symbolic and material reparations\u2014money, an apology, and public-education efforts\u2014was essential to a multigenerational healing process. For Melvin, a third-generation Japanese American, this might have looked like receiving the check. For me, in the fifth generation, placing a stamp next to his name helped me honor him and see his life as part of a much larger story. The project of making amends for Japanese American incarceration didn\u2019t end with the distribution of redress checks and an apology. It might not even finish within one lifetime, but each generation still strives to move closer."
