        "content": "MoneyGram CEO discusses Ripple and XRP in cross-border payments, highlighting challenges involved with the use of XRP and the transition to XLM.\n\nIn a recent interview with Fortune magazine, MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes delved into the discussions surrounding Ripple and XRP in cross-border payments, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities presented by these technologies.\n\nHolmes acknowledged that the traditional banking system, designed primarily for domestic payments and corporate transfers, poses a central obstacle for remittance companies.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to the report, MoneyGram, while exploring various avenues to decrease remittance costs, saw crypto as a potential solution and even integrated a buy-and-sell feature into its mobile app last year.\n\nHowever, Holmes explained that users\u2019 demand for fiat currency remains dominant as most individuals prefer not to hold cryptocurrencies. The CEO noted that users seek a direct route into traditional currencies once they receive crypto payment.\n\nMoneyGram\u2019s Encounter with XRP\n\nMoneyGram initially ventured into Ripple\u2019s solution but encountered obstacles when converting XRP into local currencies. The process required partnerships with exchanges and market makers, ultimately increasing the costs of international remittances, which the firm sought to reduce.\n\nThis challenge highlights the complexities of transitioning from cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies in cross-border payments. Recall that in 2021, the partnership between Ripple and MoneyGram ended not too long after the U.S. SEC filed a suit against Ripple, as captured in a report by The Crypto Basic.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMoneyGram Moves On with XRP\u2019s Rival\n\nDespite these hurdles, MoneyGram has continued its pursuit of innovative solutions. The company is already collaborating with Stellar blockchain (XLM) to facilitate the purchase, storage, and withdrawal of the stablecoin USDC.\n\nThis collaboration aims to address the needs of individuals in countries plagued by inflation. By holding USDC in their digital wallets backed by Stellar, people in such regions can transfer it to their local currency when needed.\n\nHowever, the advantages of holding USDC over traditional U.S. dollars are still under active exploration, with potential fee reductions being a significant consideration.\n\nUltimately, Holmes\u2019 interview emphasizes the ongoing efforts of remittance companies like MoneyGram to navigate the crypto landscape. While adopting digital assets such as XRP presented challenges, the company actively sought ways to leverage other cryptos to improve cross-border payment efficiency."

        "content": "SINGAPORE & SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ripple, the leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, today announced that its Singapore subsidiary Ripple Markets APAC Pte Ltd, has obtained In-Principle Approval of the Major Payments Institution License application from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This license will allow Ripple to offer regulated digital payment token products and services in the city state, and further scale its customers' use of its crypto-enabled On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service.\n\nRipple experienced unprecedented business momentum for ODL globally in 2022 \u2013 with a majority of this growth driven by its Singapore operations. In 2022, well over a majority of global ODL transactions flowed through Singapore, which serves as the company\u2019s Asia Pacific headquarters. As a result of this monumental growth trajectory, Ripple doubled its headcount in Singapore over the past year across key functions such as business development, compliance, finance, legal, and sales \u2013 with plans to continue increasing its presence in the world\u2019s fastest growing region.\n\n\u201cSingapore is a leading global financial center, and a prominent gateway to business in Asia Pacific. We\u2019re incredibly proud to receive an in-principle license from the MAS, reaffirming our commitment to the region and ongoing proactive engagement with regulators globally,\u201d said Brad Garlinghouse, Chief Executive Officer of Ripple. \u201cThe MAS continues to be a global leader in establishing clear rules of the road to recognise the innovation and real-world utility of digital assets, and its benefits to the global financial system. We look forward to strengthening this partnership to collectively propel the growth and development of the digital assets ecosystem in Singapore.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more countries develop regulatory frameworks for crypto, many are looking to Singapore\u2019s early leadership in developing a clear taxonomy and licensing framework. This in-principle regulatory approval from the MAS will enable us to better support our forward-looking customers looking to hone in on blockchain and crypto technologies to build a more inclusive and borderless financial system,\u201d said Stu Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer of Ripple.\n\nAs part of Ripple\u2019s ongoing engagement with the MAS, Brad will be taking the stage at the Point Zero Forum in Zurich, Switzerland on June 27, 2023, to discuss the resurgence of innovation in digital assets through investment and thoughtful regulation.\n\nAbout Ripple\n\nRipple is the leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, transforming how the world moves, manages and tokenizes value. Ripple\u2019s business solutions are faster, more transparent, and more cost effective - solving inefficiencies that have long defined the status quo. And together with partners and the larger developer community, we identify use cases where crypto technology will inspire new business models and create opportunity for more people. With every solution, we\u2019re realizing a more sustainable global economy and planet - increasing access to inclusive and scalable financial systems while leveraging carbon neutral blockchain technology and a green digital asset, XRP. This is how we deliver on our mission to build crypto solutions for a world without economic borders."
