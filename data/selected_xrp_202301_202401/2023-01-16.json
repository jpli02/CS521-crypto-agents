        "title": "XRP Investors File Class Action Lawsuit Against Coinbase - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Apart from the court battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the airdrop of the Flare Network Token (FLR) has caused quite a stir in the XRP community in recent weeks. After more than two years, XRP holders finally received their FLR tokens on January 9, 2023, even if not completely as hoped, as Bitcoinist reported.\n\nThe most renowned exchanges like Binance and Kraken have supported the distribution of the airdrop, though there is one exception: Coinbase. The American exchange has not distributed the FLT to its users.\n\nBut the XRP community around lawyer Frederick Rispoli does not accept this and has brought a class action lawsuit against Coinbase and its CEO Brian Armstrong.\n\nLead plaintiff Dallas Woody is represented by the law firm Hodl Law, which, led by Rispoli, filed the lawsuit yesterday in United States District Court. Hodl Law\u2019s Twitter account posted this:\n\nA crypto company can\u2019t steal customer funds. That\u2019s Business Law 101. Even after FTX, some exchanges still haven\u2019t got the message\u2026because they weren\u2019t being held to account. That\u2019s over. Coinbase. Return customers\u2019 SGB and FLR, with damages, now. We have filed a class action lawsuit against Coinbase for its failure to provide their customers with Songbird and Flare tokens that Coinbase publicly affirmed it would distribute. No more excuses.\n\nXRP Hodlers Sue Coinbase Over FLR Airdrop\n\nThe complaint alleges that the crypto exchange publicly agreed to distribute the airdrop among XRP holders. Coinbase\u2019s repeated and public assertions have caused XRP holders to additionally purchase XRP from the exchange, hold it in the defendant\u2019s custody, and/or transfer XRP from other wallets into the defendant\u2019s custody, according to the complaint.\n\nBased on the infringement, the plaintiffs assert civil claims against Coinbase for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud (intentional misrepresentation), negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, conversion, common count, negligence, violation of unfair competition law and request for declaratory relief.\n\nAlso part of the lawsuit are the Songbird (SGB) tokens, which were distributed as part of the airdrop from the Flare Network in September 2021 as a precursor to the FLR distribution.\n\nThe Good News: Class action lawsuit against Coinbase to force it to return its customers #SGB and #FLR. Please follow or check in with @hodl_law for updates. If you were a customer that didn\u2019t get your SGB and FLR and are interested in signing up, go here: https://t.co/Zr7wmvgxof \u2014 Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) January 16, 2023\n\nAs a result of Coinbase\u2019s unlawful actions with respect to SGB and FLR, Hodl Law, on behalf of the proposed class of all Coinbase customers with XRP accounts, seeks a declaration that the XRP holders are the rightful owners of SGB and FLR that Coinbase received and did not distribute.\n\nIn addition, Rispoli seeks damages for losses incurred as a result of defendants\u2019 unlawful conversion of plaintiff\u2019s SGB and FLR.\n\nThis claim is also asserted against Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong for having \u201cthe power and authority\u201d to direct the management and activities of Coinbase and its employees and to cause Coinbase to distribute the tokens:\n\nDefendant Armstrong had consistent and daily management of operations of Coinbase , including the decision to accept all SGB and FLR from the Flare Airdrop on behalf of his customers [\u2026]. Armstrong purposefully exercised his power and influence to cause Coinbase to engage in the wrongful conduct described [\u2026].\n\nAt press time, the XRP price was at $0.3896, consolidating below the resistance are at $0.41.\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara / Unsplash , Chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Who are the richest cryptocurrency billionaires? December 2022 list - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "After the continuous crashes, the cryptocurrency market has been suffering for months, costing its top billionaires hundreds of billions in net worth and downgrading many of them to millionaires or downright bankrupting them, some can still be called crypto and Bitcoin (BTC) billionaires.\n\nSome of these people had the fortune to lose \u2018only\u2019 a couple of hundred million. In contrast, others\u2019 losses have amounted to tens of billions, and some of them have even landed in jail, such as the founder of crypto exchange FTX and a former billionaire now worth $0, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF).\n\nAs of December 2022, the list of crypto billionaires has shrunk to include Binance\u2019s Changepg Zhao (CZ), Gemini\u2019s Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Ripple\u2019s Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, Coinbase\u2019s Brian Armstrong, and Bloq\u2019s Matthew Roszak, according to the data acquired by Forbes in late December.\n\nRichest crypto billionaires in 2022. Source: Forbes\n\nChangpeng Zhao\n\nInterestingly, despite losing more than $50 billion of his worth (although Statista puts his loss at $82 billion), the CEO of crypto trading platform Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ), remains the richest man in crypto, with an estimated net worth of $4.5 billion, stemming from his 70% stake in the crypto exchange.\n\nThat said, CZ has faced harsh public criticism (such as from economist Nouriel Roubini and VC bull Kevin O\u2019Leary) and investigations opened against him and his platform by the authorities in the United States and Europe over allegations in connection with money laundering and other financial crimes.\n\nJed McCaleb\n\nCo-founder of the crypto firm Ripple Labs, which is currently entangled in a legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Jed McCaleb can consider himself lucky for losing \u2018only\u2019 $100 million to his net worth, ending up at $2.4 billion in December, according to Forbes\u2019 estimates.\n\nHowever, his fortune has remained secure only because he sold out almost all of his holdings of XRP, the token issued by Ripple, before the crash \u2013 between December 2020 and July 2022 \u2013 in accordance with the separation agreement that all of Ripple\u2019s co-founders signed in 2013.\n\nChris Larsen\n\nAnother co-founder of Ripple, Chris Larsen, has lost more than $2 billion ($1.7 billion according to Statista) throughout 2022 due to the dropping price of XRP, resulting in his current net worth dropping to $2.1 billion but still keeping the moniker of \u2018crypto billionaire.\u2019\n\nLarsen is also named as one of the defendants in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, next to Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, on the grounds that the sale of XRP constituted an unregistered offering and selling of securities.\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss\n\nAfter investing $11 million in 2013, brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are believed to be among the first Bitcoin billionaires, currently estimated to be worth $1.1 billion each. Back in January 2022, the net worth of both was estimated to be $4 billion, respectively.\n\nThat said, the Winklevoss twins\u2019 wealth might be in danger as the SEC has recently charged both their crypto exchange Gemini and crypto investment firm Genesis for the unlawful sale of securities through the Gemini Earn crypto lending program.\n\nBrian Armstrong\n\nFinally, the CEO of the publicly traded exchange Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, had a net worth of $1.5 billion in December 2022. Despite the loss of $4.5 billion, he still remains in the billionaire ranks, unlike his colleague, Coinbase\u2019s other co-founder Fred Ehrsam, who is now worth $800 million.\n\nAmid a crisis that has slashed his own wealth, Armstrong announced a second massive round of layoffs at his crypto exchange, which let go about 18% of its workforce in June 2022. The second round is set to cut 950 jobs in order to provide \u201cthe appropriate operational efficiency to weather downturns in the crypto market.\u201d"

But how much worse?\n\nKyrie Irving puts his head down during the Nets\u2019 loss to the Thunder on Jan. 15. AP\n\nThe Nets collapsed last season when Durant suffered a sprained MCL, going 5-16 to tumble from second place in the Eastern Conference to eighth. Now, after spraining his right MCL on Jan. 8 in Miami, Durant has another week to go before he is re-evaluated.\n\nIrving and others have bristled at the comparison, saying this team \u2014 also second in the Eastern Conference \u2014 is different than the one that capitulated a year ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m consistently in the lineup: That helps,\u201d said Irving, who had only been playing road games last season during Durant\u2019s absence. \u201cWe also don\u2019t have \u2018halfway-in\u2019 anyone in the locker room, and there\u2019s a primary focus on the big picture here.\u201d\n\nThrough the Miami game where Durant went down, Irving had been averaging 26.0 points on 48.8/36.6/90.7 shooting splits.

I wish I could make a few more shots within the minutes and be efficient,\u201d Irving said. \u201cI know that\u2019ll come, and I\u2019ll continue to prepare the best way I know how and be a better example for the guys in the locker room.\u201d\n\nIrving might be overtaxed, logging 38:01 against the Celtics on Thursday and 38:08 against the Thunder on Sunday. And both defenses could key on him down the stretch.\n\nAgainst Boston Irving shot 9 of 24 and just 3 of 11 from 3-point range. But he never sat in the final period, shooting 3 of 10, missing all three 3-point attempts and going a game-worst minus-9.\n\nIrving was worse against the Thunder, finishing with 15 points on 7-for-20 shooting. And he mustered just two points in a subpar fourth quarter on 1-for-4 shooting \u2014 missing both 3-point attempts \u2014 and finishing a minus-7 as Brooklyn got outscored 37-22.\n\nKevin Durant suffered a knee injury om Jan. 8.

That is harder mentally and physically because Kevin does save you at times and give you a bucket, so now your defense is set.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge for this group is they have to dig in and have a mental fortitude greater than before, because every possession does matter.\u201d\n\nThe Nets took a five-point cushion into the fourth quarter Sunday but gave up a 15-6 run in the first four minutes. They\u2019ll need better Tuesday.\n\n\u201cFourth quarter, our offense stalled. We weren\u2019t putting the ball in the basket. It wore on us mentally on the other end.
