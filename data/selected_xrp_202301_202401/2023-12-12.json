This deficit has helped fuel a troubling rise in poverty, conflict and coups across the continent, all while global issues like climate change and strategic competition begin to take their own toll. USIP spoke with Afrobarometer\u2019s Joe Asunka, Open Society Foundations\u2019 Mooya Nyaundi and the Institute for Security Studies\u2019 Jakkie Cillers at the Africa Futures Summit about the challenges facing the African continent \u2014 and how the international community can partner with African leaders to harness Africa\u2019s development potential and promote stable, democratic governance."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nRipple\u2019s 2023 Achievements : XRP\u2019s price has surged over 80% this year, and Ripple gained partial legal victories against the SEC, leading to the dismissal of charges against its executives.\n\n: XRP\u2019s price has surged over 80% this year, and Ripple gained partial legal victories against the SEC, leading to the dismissal of charges against its executives. XRP Re-listed on Major Exchanges : Following its legal successes, XRP was re-listed on several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including the recent addition of Blockchain.com.\n\n: Following its legal successes, XRP was re-listed on several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including the recent addition of Blockchain.com. Future Price Predictions for XRP: Despite stable current prices, analysts forecast a bullish future for XRP, with predictions of significant price increases, potentially reaching $1.40 by March 2024.\n\nXRP Embraced by Another Exchange\n\nDespite the ongoing market correction, Ripple and its native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 have had quite a successful year (so far). The blockchain enterprise gained recognition with prestigious awards, while its coin\u2019s price has soared by over 80% since January 1.\n\nSome might argue that Ripple\u2019s main achievement this year was its winning streak against its big enemy \u2013 the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The firm won three major (yet partial) court victories, the first happening in mid-July when Federal Judge Analisa Torres determined that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales from years ago did not constitute an offer of investment contracts.\n\nIn October, the magistrates dismissed the regulator\u2019s wish to appeal the initial decision, while CEO \u2013 Brad Garlinghouse \u2013 and Executive Chairman \u2013 Chris Larsen \u2013 were cleared of all charges brought by the watchdog.\n\nWith Ripple currently having the upper hand in the legal battle, numerous leading cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Kraken, decided to re-list XRP on their platforms.\n\nMost recently, Blockchain.com added its name to that list, announcing support for the asset. Recall that the exchange halted XRP trading at the beginning of January 2021, shortly after the SEC sued Ripple.\n\nWhere is XRP Headed?\n\nDespite the interaction coming from Blockchain.com, XRP\u2019s price has remained relatively flat in the past 24 hours, hovering around $0.62 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nNonetheless, multiple analysts have recently laid out bullish predictions, envisioning the token to jump in the near future.\n\nThe X (Twitter) user EGRAG CRYPTO noted the recent \u201cflash crash\u201d of the crypto market, arguing it should act as a \u201cstark reminder that leveraging these trades can lead to devastating losses.\u201d Still, the analyst believes that XRP is on the right path, forecasting its valuation to climb to $1.40 by March 2024.\n\nJD was even more optimistic, claiming the asset might soon experience a so-called \u201cGolden Cross,\u201d which could possibly lift the price exponentially.\n\nThose willing to check how XRP might perform in the remaining weeks of the ongoing year could take a look at our dedicated video below:"

        "content": "Most cryptocurrencies out there make you scratch your head and wonder, \"what's the point of this?\" But Ripple (CRYPTO: XRP) aims to be something of value in a sea of scammy and silly tokens.\n\nLaunched in 2012 by Opencoin (now called Ripple Labs), Ripple operates a blockchain ledger, with its native token XRP, that allows financial institutions to make fast and cheap cross-border transactions.\n\nDespite its interesting ambitions, this payments-focused cryptocurrency is currently sitting 83% below its all-time high, even though it has soared 90% in 2023.\n\nShould investors buy Ripple while it's down? Let's focus on some of the most important factors you should know.\n\nRegulatory headaches\n\nMost people understand fully that the financial services industry is probably the most complex and thorough from a regulatory perspective. This is why the advent of digital tokens has been so interesting. It has created somewhat of a regulatory gray area where no one knows for certain whether a particular cryptocurrency is a security or not.\n\nIn December 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and its two executives for issuing an unregistered security with its Ripple tokens. Fast forward three years later, and the issue looks to be resolved. A court ruling in fact concluded that Ripple wasn't an unregistered security. And the SEC was rejected when trying to appeal this ruling.\n\nIt's difficult to say if this regulatory overhang is completely a thing of the past at this point. As is the case with any new technology, rules and laws are constantly evolving. There could be more headaches in the future.\n\nInvestors who are thinking of adding Ripple to their portfolios need to understand that this will always be a risk. This is especially true considering Ripple's strategy of trying to disrupt cross-border payments between financial institutions.\n\nCompetitive landscape\n\nTo its credit, Ripple has found success bringing on some banks to use its services. But I have never heard of these before. Sentbe, Banco Rendimento, and Induslnd Bank are all Ripple customers.\n\nI wonder, though, if the major financial institutions -- like JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America, which are some of the largest in the world -- would ever use Ripple's network to handle these types of transactions. And I believe the answer is that they wouldn't.\n\nTake JPMorgan. It's already been working on a Ripple competitor known as Onyx. This massive bank has existing relationships with millions of consumers and businesses, not to mention the influence it has in Washington D.C. It's not sitting by idly. If there's a real market need for a blockchain-based solution to help make international payments faster and cheaper, you can be sure that a company like JPMorgan is probably in the best position to benefit.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the crypto space, Ripple has to worry about the likes of Solana, which is known to theoretically handle 50,000 transactions per second. And the second most valuable digital asset, Ethereum, is a leader when it comes to decentralized finance protocols. This just means that Ripple will have its work cut out for it as it tries to gain broader adoption.\n\nTemper expectations\n\nAs things stand today, Ripple is the fifth most valuable cryptocurrency on the face of the planet, with a market cap of $35 billion. This standing is definitely admirable, and it shows that investors see some kind of potential over the long term.\n\nBut even though the token is down right now, I'm not a buyer at these levels.\n\nRegulatory concerns are something that I worry about. Handling payments between banks and across borders means that Ripple will always be in the spotlight of legislators.\n\nPlus, it's hard to envision a scenario where Ripple handles more volume than the largest banks out there, some of which are developing competing networks.\n\nThese two key risks can't be ignored.\n\nMore From The Motley Fool\n\nJPMorgan Chase is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.
