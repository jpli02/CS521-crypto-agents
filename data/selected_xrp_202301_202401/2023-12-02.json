        "title": "Ripple Keeps 200M XRP, Locks 800M XRP After Releasing 1B coins - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Prominent crypto payments company Ripple makes a strategic move to stabilize the XRP market by re-locking 800M XRP in escrow shortly after releasing 1B coins.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert, Ripple has re-locked 800 million units of XRP in escrow, accounting for 80% of the 1 billion XRP recently released from escrow.\n\nData shared by Whale Alert shows that Ripple re-locked the 800 million XRP in three different transactions, with each containing 500M, 200M, and 100M XRP apiece.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDetails of the Transaction\n\nA closer look at these transactions on XRP Scan shows that the 500M XRP coins were locked in escrow from one of Ripple\u2019s addresses, tagged \u201cRipple 10.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAdditionally, Ripple locked 200 million XRP in escrow from another wallet named \u201cRipple 11.\u201d The company sent the remaining 100 million XRP to its escrow account from the same \u201cRipple 11\u201d address.\n\n200M XRP Remains Liquid\n\nThe development comes hours after the leading blockchain company unlocked 1 billion XRP from its escrow account. With Ripple locking 800 million XRP in escrow, the leading blockchain company will keep the remaining 200M XRP for itself.\n\nRipple could deploy the 200M XRP into the market at any moment. As a customary practice, the potential sale of the 200M XRP will be done in a way that will not negatively impact the coin\u2019s price.\n\nRipple\u2019s decision to always re-lock 800M XRP from each 1B XRP monthly release is part of an effort to stabilize the XRP market.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko data, XRP was changing hands at $0.61, up 1% over the past 24 hours at press time. XRP is still ranked as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $33.1 billion.\n\nRipple Now Holds 40.7B XRP in Escrow\n\nWith Ripple re-locking 800M XRP, the company\u2019s escrow balance now stands at 40.7 billion XRP. Recall that in its Q3 2023 report, Ripple disclosed that it held 41.3 billion XRP in escrow as of September 30.\n\nSo far, the company has released 200M XRP each for three consecutive months, October, November, and December, thus bringing its escrow balance to 40.7B XRP."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nFintech giant Ripple has returned 800 million XRP to its escrow, per Whale Alert data. As is customary, Ripple released 1 billion XRP from its escrow on the first day of December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree transactions made up the locking of the 800 million XRP back into escrow: First, 500,000,000 XRP, or half a billion, worth $304,378,440, was locked in Ripple escrow; second, 200,000,000 XRP, or $121,705,709, was locked; and third, 100,000,000 XRP, or $60,893,306, was locked in Ripple escrow in a separate tranche.\n\nIn 2017, Ripple introduced its escrow system, pledging to release 55 billion XRP over 55 months in monthly installments of 1 billion XRP.\n\nBy eliminating any unexpected shocks or dumps that can have an impact on the price of XRP, Ripple can transfer XRP to the market in a predictable manner, thanks to the escrow mechanism.\n\nAll 1 billion XRP that Ripple unlocks each month is not sold or used, though. Usually, Ripple returns to the escrow roughly 800 million XRP and retains another 200 million XRP for its operating costs and other business ventures.\n\nIn another move, a stash of 17.9 million XRP exited the Bitso crypto exchange. Whale Alert reports of a 17,900,000 XRP tranche worth $10,849,815 transferred from Bitso to an unknown whale wallet.\n\nExchange outflows are a sign that investors are shifting their funds into storage, which can be a bullish indication because it suggests that they may decide to hold onto their assets rather than sell them quickly. This suggests that investors might believe that prices are about to rise.\n\nAs of this writing, XRP was trading at $0.614, up 0.20% over the previous day."

        "content": "David Schwartz, Ripple CTO took to the X app to announce that this weekend marks his 11th year \u201cRippleversary\u201d, which connotes that launch of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in 2012.\n\nThe Launch of the XRP Ledger\n\nXRP community members felicitated with Ripple CTO as he commemorated his time with the crypto payment company. According to a published statement, Schwartz together with Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto began the development of the XRP Ledger as far back as 2011.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTheir inspiration at the time was the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) but they were more concerned about its limitations (one of which was the waste inherent in mining) and decided to improve on it. With the goal of improvement, Schwartz, McCaleb, and Britto set out to build a digital asset that was more sustainable and built specifically for payments. This marked the birth of the XRP Ledger.\n\nNoteworthy, the three engineers made significant progress in their development and by June 2012, the XRP Ledger was rolled out. It was after this time that Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen joined the team. The new group started NewCoin in September 2012 which was later renamed OpenCoin and now known as Ripple.\n\nIn 2020, the XRPL Foundation, an independent and nonprofit entity with a mission to accelerate the development and adoption of the decentralized XRP Ledger, was launched.\n\nXRPL Debuts Innovative Features\n\nWithin the space of 11 years, the XRP Ledger has seen outstanding improvements and has been crucial to the implementation of other blockchain-based projects. The protocol possesses some key features that makes it attractive to other projects. The XRP Ledger was upgraded in September to version 1.12.0 which came with some new features.\n\nAutomated Market Maker (AMM), Clawback function, and fixReducedOffersV1 are some of the newly introduced upgrades. It also has a liquidity feature that makes it possible to provide liquidity for a restricted token that is resident on the XRPL. One of XRPL\u2019s recent achievements is the mainnet launch of the much-anticipated fixNFTokenRemint upgrade\n\nIn terms of transactions, the XRP Ledger has hit several milestones that has given it an edge amongst its core competitors. Last month, the blockchain network closed its 84 millionth ledger.\n\nAll of these innovations have earned the XRPL a stellar reputation in the crypto industry."

        "content": "Henry Kissinger will be remembered in much of the world as a foreign policy genius who ushered China into the world community, driving a wedge between Beijing and its Cold War ally Moscow, and eventually transforming the world economy.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the Nixon-era national security adviser and secretary of state who died this week at age 100 is being remembered differently.\n\nThe opening to China that Kissinger engineered sent a rippling effect to Thailand, which, former Thai Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun said, had trepidation for Communism.\n\n\"A lot of Thai people didn't understand China, believing that the communist China couldn't be trusted,\" Anand, who served as the prime minister of Thailand from 1991 to 1992, told VOA's Thai Service in May when Kissinger celebrated his 100th birthday.\n\n\"I don't think it was [only because of] Kissinger's policy\" toward China but \"also because of the ties between the Thai and U.S. military\" that focused on defense rather than diplomatic relations, said Anand.\n\nArchitect of war strategy\n\nIn Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, meanwhile, Kissinger is remembered as the architect of a war strategy that devastated vast regions and killed uncounted numbers of people.\n\n\"If we just focus on the region \u2026 Kissinger's decisions in these areas, no matter how brilliant he may have been, no matter how skillful a negotiator he may have been, were disastrous for hundreds of thousands of innocent people,\" said Larry Berman, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Davis who has written extensively on the Vietnam War.\n\n\"It is where the judgment of history will be,\" Berman told VOA's Vietnamese Service on Thursday.\n\nCambodia, Vietnam and Laos\n\nThe United States and its allies dropped more than 7.5 million tons of bombs on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia between 1965 and 1975 \u2014 twice the amount dropped on Europe and Asia during World War II, according to the website Storymaps.\n\nAt the time, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, which was supported by the Soviet Union, China and other communist countries, was fighting the U.S.-backed Republic of Vietnam in the south.\n\nAnalysts say Kissinger's policies aimed at quashing the communist forces were responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths.\n\nNorth Vietnam moved troops and supplies to the South via Laos on what was known as the Ho Chi Minh trail. Kissinger and other American officials wanted that to end.\n\nFrom 1964-1973, the U.S. dropped 2.5 million tons of bombs on Laos, making it the most bombed country in the world, according to Legacies of War. Tens of thousands of people were killed.\n\nThe U.S. dropped an estimated 500,000 tons of bombs in Cambodia as what began with a CIA operation in Laos expanded to Cambodia, said Erin Lin, assistant professor of Political Science at the Ohio State University, in her book, \"When the Bombs Stopped.\"\n\nThe bombing killed as many as 150,000 Cambodian civilians, said Yale University historian Ben Kiernan, cited by The Washington Post.\n\nIn Cambodia, the bombing \"enraged populace into the arms of an insurgency that had enjoyed relatively little support until the bombing began, setting in motion the expansion of the Vietnam War deeper into Cambodia, a coup d'\u00e9tat in 1970, the rapid rise of the Khmer Rouge, and ultimately the Cambodian genocide,\" according to a Walrus magazine article in Yale University's genocide studies program.\n\nIn Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, trained personnel, children and farmers are still finding unexploded ordnance more than 50 years after the last U.S. service member left Vietnam on March 29, 1973.\n\nSome of it is removed by those who know how. Some of it injures or kills the finder.\n\nRos Chantrabot, a Khmer historian and personal adviser to Hun Sen, prime minister of Cambodia from 1985 until this year, told VOA's Khmer Service on Thursday that \"Henry Kissinger had a huge responsibility \u2026 for involving Cambodia in the war, which killed many people and left many landmines in Cambodia today.\"\n\n\"The sad reality is, he leaves this legacy which many, many Cambodians still pay the price for,\" said Sophal Ear, a Cambodian American political scientist, to The Washington Post. \"To this day, there are people who \u2026 lose limb and life in the process of trying to make a living in a land that has been filled with bombs.\"\n\nEast Timor\n\nBrad Simpson, professor at the University of Connecticut Department of History, said Kissinger is also responsible for backing Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in 1975.\n\nIndonesia said at the time that annexation of East Timor was crucial to prevent the spread of communism.\n\nSimpson told VOA's Indonesian Service on Thursday that Kissinger \"helped to expedite the flow of weapons and military equipment to Indonesia over the next year as it faced a determined guerrilla resistance from armed East Timorese resistance fighters.\"\n\nHe continued, saying, \"By the time Kissinger left office in the beginning of 1977, Indonesia had killed perhaps a tenth of the population of East Timor.\" At the time, the population was 619,308, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe Indonesian invasion led to a long and bloody occupation of the territory that ended only after an international peacekeeping force was introduced in 1999 and as many as 200,000 people had died, according to National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 62.\n\nThe Korean Service, Khmer Service, Vietnamese Service, Indonesian Service and Thai Service contributed to this report."
