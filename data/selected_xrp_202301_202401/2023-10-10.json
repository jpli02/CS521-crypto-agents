        "content": "Kristina Campbell, Ripple\u2019s chief financial officer, is leaving the crypto company and has already joined another firm as CFO, according to her LinkedIn.\n\nPer a company statement, Ripple said it was \u201cgrateful for Kristina\u2019s leadership over the past 2+ years and her contributions to the company as we\u2019ve experienced strong global momentum, business growth and navigated regulatory headwinds.\u201d\n\nRipple also has reportedly launched the search for someone to replace Campbell in the crucial C-suite post.\n\nCampbell thanked her colleagues at Ripple for a \u201cmemorable\u201d few years, in a LinkedIn post. Campbell spent two years and seven months as Ripple\u2019s CFO.\n\nMemorable is likely the perfect word for Campbell\u2019s time at Ripple, a company still battling it out in court with the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its alleged unregistered securities offerings.\n\nBut something that was more in Campbell\u2019s direct line of responsibility \u2014 Ripple\u2019s acquisition strategy \u2014 drew headlines recently when it rather suddenly abandoned its plan to snap up Fortress Trust, a deal that was publicly announced in early September.\n\nNow Campbell, a Harvard Business School graduate with a storied career in finance, has decided to do a 180 and work for a virtual healthcare clinic for women and families.\n\nHer role will still be financial in nature as she\u2019ll be the CFO at Maven Clinic, just like she was at Ripple and PayNearMe before that.\n\nCampbell started her career in 1997 as an associate at Citigroup before jumping ship to Saybrook Capital in 2000, where she served as vice president.\n\nShe again moved in 2004 to consulting firm Bain & Company, where she advised private equity funds on mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThen, she had a brief stint at Avery Dennison in 2009 as a director of corporate strategy before joining up with financial services firm Green Dot Corporation for a little over five years.\n\nCampbell is also a founding member of an invite-only organization called The F Suite, which serves as a community for fellow CFOs to share advice and knowledge with one another.\n\nUpdated Oct. 10, 2023 at 9:00 am ET: Added additional context from a Ripple company statement.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "The Breeders Beyond the Ripple of \u201cLast Splash\u201d - bandcamp.com",
        "content": "The Breeders Beyond the Ripple of \u201cLast Splash\u201d\n\nBy Patrick King \u00b7 October 10, 2023\n\nGreat things can present themselves through boredom. Kim Deal knows better than most. When the alternative rock icon needed an outlet for her songwriting outside of her main gig as bassist and vocalist in the Pixies, she established a much-emulated punk-leaning pop formula marked by heavy guitars with her highly influential band The Breeders at the tail end of the 1980s. Though they\u2019ve released six terrific albums, it was 1993\u2019s Last Splash that cemented the band\u2019s legacy. The record\u2019s 30th anniversary is being celebrated with a box set that includes a half-speed master from the original analog recordings as well as a bonus 12\u201d including an unreleased song from the initial sessions, \u201cGo Man Go.\u201d\n\n\u201c[\u2018Go Man Go\u2019] had come from the idea of a Pixies song, and I wasn\u2019t sure if Charles [Frank Black of the Pixies] would be cool with it, so I just bailed on it and we just did \u2018Divine Hammer,\u2019\u201d says Kim of unearthing this lost tune. It also includes a rendition of the Last Splash standout \u201cDivine Hammer,\u201d featuring Dinosaur Jr\u2019s J. Mascis on lead vocals.\n\nDeal believes that, unlike previous reissues, this is perhaps the definitive-sounding version of Last Splash. \u201cI usually hate remasters because I like a certain sound,\u201d she says. \u201cSo when something gets remastered, it\u2019s usually a clean digital remaster where all the highs are pumped really loud, so they sound better on streaming and stuff. This isn\u2019t really a remaster. What it is, is an analog recording done half speed to two discs that get played at 45 RPM. So these big fat grooves on that vinyl should sound better. And that\u2019s what, for me, was important.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate, the version of the band that recorded the seminal album\u2014Kim and her twin sister Kelley Deal on guitars and vocals, with Josephine Wiggs on bass, and Jim McPherson on drums\u2014are hitting the road to play the album in its entirety. \u201cThe songs are so much fun to play, and they\u2019re just as much fun to play now,\u201d says Kelley. \u201cI remember somebody, maybe an interviewer, had asked, \u2018Oh, do you ever get sick of playing \u2018Cannonball\u2019?\u2019 No. Never. It\u2019s so much fun to be in the middle of that song. It\u2019s like a roller coaster ride.\u201d\n\nTo mark this huge occasion, we sat down with all four members of The Breeders to discuss each of the band\u2019s records in their spotless discography.\n\nThings had been picking up for the Pixies in the late 1980s with the release of two critically adored albums, Surfer Rosa and Doolittle. Even as the world seemed a little bit more open to what the Pixies could do, Kim found herself able to do less and less within the band in terms of songwriting. While the band was on tour with 4AD labelmates Throwing Muses, she began showing the songs she had been sitting on to Muses front person Tanya Donnelly.\n\n\u201cIt was a period of time that Charles was busy doing something, and Kristen [Hersh of Throwing Muses] was busy. I think she was having a baby. So me and Tanya had quite some time together, and we would play guitar together, and it was quite fun,\u201d remembers Kim. \u201cWe ended up telling Ivo [Watts-Russell, founder of 4AD] that we were doing that. When he found out that me and Tanya were playing some songs together, he asked if he could hear a recording of it. So we gave him a recording, and he said, \u2018These are great. I\u2019d like to put out an album.\u2019 Fantastic! So who would we get to play? Well\u2026 How do I say I spent a drunken night with Josephine?\u201d\n\nThe story is as follows. In 1988, Josephine Wiggs\u2019 band Perfect Disaster opened for the Pixies at the London stop of their tour with My Bloody Valentine. Wiggs had admired Kim\u2019s playing and charisma but felt way too shy to approach her without a good reason. Fortunately, a friend of hers from Frankfurt, where she had been living, asked Wiggs to get Kim\u2019s autograph, and the two began chatting. Sometime later, Wiggs saw that the Pixies would be playing a show just outside of Frankfurt at the Batschkapp. She suggested to some friends that they should show up in the afternoon when the band would be sound-checking to see if her new friend Kim Deal could get them on the guest list. It worked, and the Wiggs and her friends made it in and wound up hanging out and drinking with Kim after the show.\n\n\u201cThe Batschkapp is right near a railway line and we were sitting on the platform of the railway line just chatting,\u201d says Wiggs. \u201cIt started getting later and later, and I said to Kim, \u2018How are you getting back to your hotel?\u2019 And she said, \u2018You guys are giving me a lift!\u2019 And we were like, \u2018We don\u2019t have a car. We came out here on the train.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from America! If you go to a club and you have a car, you give a friend a ride home,\u201d Kim chimes in with a laugh.\n\nThe Pixies tour bus was long gone by that point, so Wiggs and her friends piled into a cab with Kim to take her back to her hotel by the airport. About six months later, a surprised Wiggs received calls from both 4AD and Kim asking her to join the Breeders as a bassist so Kim, the famous bassist, could focus on playing guitar.\n\nKim, Donnelly, and Wiggs got together with producer Steve Albini, whom Kim had worked with in the Pixies, to start hashing out the songs that would become the first Breeders record, Pod. In need of a good drummer, Albini suggested Britt Walford, the snotty young punk from the short-lived Kentucky greats Slint. All of the rehearsals for what would eventually become Pod were held at Josephine\u2019s house in the small town of Biggleswade outside of Bedfordshire in the UK. They recorded for ten days at The Palladium in Edinburgh, Scotland. Pod was released in May of 1990 and, right out of the gate, it exceeded all of the musical potential that was only hinted at in Kim\u2019s work in the Pixies. Filled with off-kilter charm and sweetness but never short on power, the record is a foundational document for thousands of bands looking to toe the line between pop songcraft and Wire-indebted art punk. But for all of its successes as a statement of Kim\u2019s strengths as a songwriter, she still had obligations to fulfill in the Pixies.\n\n\u201c[The Breeders] never toured it or anything,\u201d she says \u201c[Donnelly] had a baby. I was back on tour [with the Pixies]. We did two shows in London. But we didn\u2019t actually continue on down that path for a while.\u201d\n\nThe Breeders knew that Donnelly would not be a permanent fixture in the band from the get-go. As she had started her own band, Belly, aside from still being in Throwing Muses, she would begin to have less time to play in the Breeders than before. During the search for a new guitarist, Wiggs remembers getting a call from Kim proposing the idea of asking her twin sister Kelley to join the band. \u201cI think she prefaced it with some, you know, condition or some sort, and she said, \u2018Kelly\u2019s going to play lead guitar. She doesn\u2019t actually know how to play the guitar, but I think it\u2019s going to be okay.\u2019\u201d\n\nKelley had been working at Litton Computer Services, a large defense contractor back in Dayton, Ohio, the Deals\u2019s hometown. She asked for time off to practice and to record the Safari EP, which came out in 1992, as a new member of the band. The band was also on the hunt for a new drummer. Jim McPherson had been playing in the local Dayton band the Raging Mantras and was well aware that their town was home to a bonafide rock star in Kim Deal. He and his fellow band member Nick Kizrinis, who worked at a local record store, would flier Kim\u2019s house every time she returned from tour, hoping she would make a gig. One day, Kim and then-boyfriend SPIN writer Jim Greer appeared in front of her house to ask the two of them if they would be interested in playing on some demos. McPherson was asked to join the band shortly after, completing the full lineup.\n\nIn 1992, the Pixies famously disbanded out of the blue, allowing Kim to finally take the Breeders out on the road. They toured most of that year, including a run with Nirvana in Ireland. Once they returned to the United States, they made plans to enter the studio to record some of the songs they had been working on. The band drove from Dayton to record with Mike Freegard at Coast Recorders in North Hollywood, California, and then to Brilliant Studios in the heart of the Mission District in San Francisco, which the band found to be an intense experience. \u201cIt was super scary,\u201d McPherson remembers. \u201cJosephine and I would walk ourselves through the Mission District, and I personally, on purpose, wore a sweatshirt that had a red stain on it that I had done a [construction] job with. I was terrified.\u201d\n\nThe resulting record, Last Splash, catapulted the band to a new stratosphere based on the strength of its lead single \u201cCannonball,\u201d which received heavy rotation on MTV with its Kim Gordon and Spike Jonze-directed video. For Kelley, the success of the song was welcome but puzzling.\n\n\u201cI do remember being surprised that it was received so well because \u2018Cannonball\u2019 doesn\u2019t really repeat correctly. It does have a chorus. But the verses are weird. They\u2019re odd numbers, it stops and starts, there\u2019s all this feedback everywhere. I didn\u2019t hear that and go, \u2018Ah, radio hit!\u2019 Because there was a lot of like alternative music, and this is a dance song, man! There wasn\u2019t that wonderful mix of both. With nice, heavy guitars, but also harmonies, and you can move your butt to it, you know? So it was a really nice blend. It\u2019s a reggae song.\u201d\n\nEven though that song remains ubiquitous, it is hardly the album\u2019s lone shining moment. A summer barbeque record in the truest sense, the album is a triumph of effortless hooks and slyly adventurous pop pastiche. Songs like \u201cDivine Hammer\u201d and the Ed\u2019s Redeeming Qualities cover \u201cDrivin\u2019 On 9\u201d are as immediately tuneful as anything produced in the alternative era, while tracks like \u201cNo Aloha\u201d and \u201cRoi \u201d hinted at a darker side lurking within Kim\u2019s writing.\n\nLast Splash cemented the Breeders stars, and the success of the record saw them playing bigger shows on tour, including a massive hometown show at Dayton\u2019s Hara Arena with Ohio bands Guided By Voices, The Afghan Whigs, and The New Bomb Turks.\n\nThe reaction from the crowds exceeded anything they could\u2019ve imagined. At a show in an upstairs venue in Spain, the venue owners had to go on stage and tell the band to stop playing because they could see the beams in the ceiling had begun giving out as people lost their minds to \u201cCannonball.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe went downstairs, and they showed us what they were talking about,\u201d remembers Kim.\n\nShortly after the major success of Last Splash, Kim and McPherson worked together on short-lived project the Amps in 1995, but the two found themselves being pulled apart. \u201cAfter the Amps record, me and Jim didn\u2019t have a falling out,\u201d Kim explains. \u201cWe had more of like internal psychological implosions, each individual. He was going through something, I was going through something. So we lost touch with each other.\u201d\n\nStill, Kim had amassed a bounty of songs that needed to be recorded. By the early 2000s, McPherson had joined Guided By Voices, and Wiggs was working on her project, Dusty Trails. Without the two of them on board, the Deal sisters needed to find a new rhythm section. Not knowing where to turn, Kim ran into guitarist Richard Presely, bassist Armando Lopez, and drummer Jose Medeles, who had been playing as the band behind Lee Ving for a touring iteration of the legendary L.A. punk band FEAR. In typical fashion, Kim struck up a friendship with the band over drinks one night in New York City, and the decision was made that both Kim and Kelly would be leaving Dayton to live in East L.A. and work on a brand new Breeders record with this new lineup.\n\n\u201cThey were such good players,\u201d remembers Kim. \u201cWe had a rehearsal space and we worked really hard. We rehearsed constantly, constantly coming up with songs.\u201d\n\nMost of the tracking was done between Electrical Audio with Steve Albini in Chicago and Kim doing some work in Austin with Andy Taub at his studio, Brooklyn Bridge. Much darker and more experimental in sound, Title TK shook up the notion that the Breeders were still searching for sunny hits a la Last Splash. The album highlights both Kim and Kelley\u2019s abilities as arrangers, as songs like the playful leadoff track \u201cLittle Fury\u201d and the fuzz-bass-led \u201cSon Of Three\u201d are masterclasses in dynamics, showing how much ground the band can cover while letting instruments hang back in service of Kim\u2019s melodies. Despite such a prolonged hiatus between Title TK and Last Splash, Kim and Kelley wouldn\u2019t let this creative rebirth lay dormant for quite as long next time.\n\nFollowing in a similar experimental vein as Title TK, the same lineup returned in 2008 with Mountain Battles. In the time between the two records, Kim had toured the world with a reformed Pixies, which kept her from entering the studio for six years. Yet Title TK is possibly the most eclectic and stylistically adventurous record the band has ever produced. Starting from the 60s psych-tinged opening seconds of \u201cOverglazed,\u201d the album is full of twists that show the full scope of the Deal sisters\u2019 malleable pop vocabulary. A mostly mid-tempo set, the record rarely bubbles over with the fast-paced, punk-leaning pop the band pioneered in the early \u201890s. The songs that require gas, such as \u201cWalk It Off,\u201d excel with a sticky and hook-filled strut, but the true standouts on the record are when the arrangements make room to demonstrate why both Kim and Kelley\u2019s voices are such genuine treasures. In the surfy ballad \u201cRegalame Esta Noche,\u201d originally written by Mexican composer Roberto Cantoral, Kelley sings entirely in Spanish with command, a language she does not know how to speak. In another fun turn, the two sisters also try their hand at singing in German on the aptly titled jittery art-punk number \u201cGerman Studies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was really fun, and it felt really experimental,\u201d says Kelley of the recording sessions for Mountain Battles, once again done with Steve Albini at Electrical Audio. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand why, at the time, we were like, \u2018Sure, we should do a song in Spanish and another song in German, which neither one of us actually speaks. Of course. Why not do that?\u201d\n\nWhile both Kim and Kelley had been soldiering on without McPherson and Wiggs, the two ex-members had been keeping tabs on what their old pals had been doing. In both of their cases, they felt like they had missed out on being a part of two fabulous records. \u201cI felt like I was really missing out on something. Like I really wish I was there,\u201d laments McPherson. \u201c\u200b\u200bWe had such great chemistry for Last Splash. When those records came out, I was missing it. I was missing playing with them.\u201d\n\nJosephine felt similarly, though she had had the chance to rejoin the two sisters onstage for 4AD\u2019s 25th-anniversary show in 2005 and again when the band\u2019s new bassist Armando Lopez had to leave the Title TK tour to go home for the birth of his child in 2009. The second time around, she learned the band\u2019s full set in one day, just in time for a show at New York City\u2019s Bowery Ballroom. As she filled in for a few more shows on that tour, Wiggs regained the callouses in her fingers doing the iconic bass slides to \u201cCannonball,\u201d and it only made her miss playing in the band permanently even more.\n\nLuckily for both McPherson and Wiggs, they were soon reunited with both Kim and Kelley to celebrate the 20th-anniversary of Last Splash that would see the band playing the classic album in full around the world in 2013. The band played 60 dates throughout 2013 and into 2014 that also coincided with the release of a special 20th Anniversary reissue.\n\nWhile the tour rolled on, Kim brought a brand new song to her bandmates, titled \u201cWalking With The Killer,\u201d which was quickly incorporated into subsequent setlists. It lit a spark for the band, and they immediately regained the magic songwriting chemistry they had back in 1993, with each member bringing new ideas to the table.\n\nOnce they were off the road, the band entered the studio to record their fifth album, All Nerve. In typical Breeders fashion, it came out in 2018, nearly a decade after the release of Mountain Battles. The album marks a return to form in the truest sense, playing like an effortless extension of the musical camaraderie between all four members. While touring behind the anniversary of Last Splash, the Breeders found that a younger generation of bands all viewed them as a touchstone to a certain harder-edged corner of indie rock. They took out supporting acts like Speedy Ortiz and Parquet Courts. But one of their most vocal supporters was the wildly popular Australian songwriter Courtney Barnett, whose band visited the Breeders in the studio one day and wound up lending backing vocals to the song \u201cHowl At The Summit.\u201d\n\nThe admiration for the band\u2019s previous milestones and the appetite for new material amazes both the Deal sisters. But as they\u2019re taking one more, and perhaps final, look back at Last Splash, they are blown away by how seminal a record it has remained for old fans and new fans alike. \u201cIt really is gratifying, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kim asks Kelley of the enduring love for Last Splash. \u201cIt really is gratifying to see it be the soundtrack of not only people like our age, or close to it, but to see people who hear the record and it does something for them that are younger.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really interesting to me, too,\u201d responds Kelley.\n\nWhen the question of another Breeders record comes up, Kelly says, \u201cWe\u2019re always working on something.\u201d McPherson lights up at the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t want to swing a hammer no more [sic],\u201d he explains with a laugh, as he has had to go back to manual labor when the band is off the road. \u201cPlease, more tours!\u201d he adds, rubbing his arms jokingly."
