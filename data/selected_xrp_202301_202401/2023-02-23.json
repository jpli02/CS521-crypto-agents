        "content": "EA DICE is in the process of creating a new team to support Ridgeline Games with its single-player campaign for Battlefield.\n\nLast year, EA announced a new studio, Seattle-based Ridgeline Games, tasked with developing a narrative campaign taking place in the Battlefield universe.\n\nBattlefield 2042 Season 3 Escalation Gameplay Trailer\n\nLed by Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto and composed of industry veterans from various parts of the globe, the studio aims to tell stories and take players on adventures within the Battlefield universe.\n\nWhile DICE will remain focused on the multiplayer aspect, Ridgeline is working on the single-player portion, while Ripple Effect is working on a different Battlefield game.\n\nThe studios will work together to expand upon future Battlefield games and experiences that will serve as extensions as part of a Battlefield universe.\n\nIn this universe, the world is interconnected with shared characters and narrative.\n\n\u201cOur decision to build out our single-player team here at DICE is a proactive approach that arms our global teams with the resources they need early on as we look ahead to the next Battlefield experience,\" said DICE VP and GM Rebecka Coutaz, per GI.biz.\n\n\"We have an immense amount of strength and opportunity within our three global studios, with each team bringing their own set of deep franchise experiences. Now, we are able to expand opportunities and benefit from new talent that will help Ridgeline write the next chapter for the franchise.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur vision coupled with their experience with the franchise is going to see us build a single-player campaign that will engage players in new ways while also remaining true to the classic elements of what makes Battlefield truly unique,\" added Lehto.\n\nIn 2021, EA announced that Respawn Entertainment co-founder Vince Zampella would be in charge of the Battlefield franchise going forward. His new position came on the heel of DICE GM Oskar Gabrielson exiting the studio."

        "content": "Load testing the PSU\n\nLoad Testing The PSU\n\nTesting a power supply is challenging, and you need professional load testers to check the PSU\u2019s behavior correctly.\n\nThe first basic test is performed with a simple power supply tester. It doesn\u2019t load the PSU with more than a couple of Watts, but it helps determine if the power supply unit is operational. There\u2019s a self-check indicating if the voltages are at the proper levels. As you can see, there have been no issues with the FSP Hydro G Pro 1000W (ATX 3.0) unit.\n\nThe following setup was used for the remainder of the testing:\n\nVoltcraft VC-870 Digital Multimeter - voltage measurement (+ Fluke 97 scope meter)\n\nOscilloscope - GW INSTEK GDS 3154\n\nDC load - original solution\n\nFluke 97 Scope meter (a measurement of voltage and ripple),\n\nVoltcraft SL-451 decibel meter (volume measurement)\n\nACUVIM-IIRF \u2013 for measuring active power (input from the socket).\n\nPCE Instruments PCE-DT 50 tachometer \u2013 for the measurement of the rotational speed of the fan.\n\nMeasurements are taken only using 230 V input voltage.\n\nEfficiency\n\nIn our power supply reviews, we emulate real-world usage by creating such loads as a power-hungry, multi-GPU setup with a powerful CPU would generate. Older components used to require more power, but there has been some press. In a typical configuration, reaching over 500-600 Watts of power draw is difficult. Checking efficiency is a relatively easy thing to accomplish. Let\u2019s take a look at Seasonic Prime\u2019s efficiency first.\n\nIt does look great even at low loads (e.g., 10%, equaling 100 W), which is quite typical of the idle state in modern PCs.\n\nMaximum load\n\nNext is the maximum wattage this unit can hold before switching off.\n\nMaximum Load Efficiency (in %) 1264W 88.72%\n\nEfficiency looks excellent, even above 100% load. Watts is a great value, but you wouldn\u2019t want to come close to that for very long.\n\nErP Lot 6 Power Off wattage\n\nWe looked at the powered-off status (ErP/EuP), productivity mode (when we stress the CPU), and gaming. The lower the wattage, the more efficient the PSU. It is that simple.\n\nErP Lot 6 Power Off value in Watts 1000 W 0.15\n\nThis is well below the 0.5 W requirement.\n\nRipple testing\n\nFirst up is the ATX12V V2.2 specification for DC output ripple:\n\nATX12V Ver 2.2 Noise/Ripple Tolerance Output Ripple (mV p-p) +3.3 V 50 +5 V 50 +12 V 120\n\nThe FSP Hydro G Pro 1000W (ATX 3.0) 1000 W achieved the following results:\n\nAC Ripple (mV p-p) +3.3 V +5 V +12 V 100 W (10%) 12 14 15 250 W (25%) 10 12 18 500 W (50%) 15 18 20 750 W (75%) 18 16 24 1000 W (100%) 16 15 25\n\nThe values are very well within tolerance. Even in the worst-case scenario (100% load), it is not even a quarter of the allowed number, so this is not worrying."

        "content": "Angela Weldon, who is not represented by the union on strike, supports her co-workers on her day off Wednesday. PC: Kehaulani Cerizo PC: Kehaulani Cerizo\n\nHundreds of healthcare workers left their jobs at key hospitals around Maui County on Wednesday to strike over better pay. And although Maui Health echoed that services will continue as scheduled, there was a report of patient impacts tied to the strike.\n\nAn important medical procedure scheduled in advance for an elderly Maui patient was canceled Wednesday due to the strike, according to the patient\u2019s family member, who asked to remain anonymous due to possible repercussions.\n\nThe family member pleaded that Maui Health management find a swift solution so the community can feel safe again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d the Maui resident said. \u201cIs (Maui Health) being responsible if we have emergencies?\u201d\n\nHowever, Maui Health spokesperson Tracy Dallarda told Maui Now on Wednesday night that she received confirmation \u201cthere has been no interruption to procedures or services.\u201d\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD\n\n\u201cAccording to our internal operational sources, that is not accurate,\u201d Dallarda said in response to a claim that a procedure was canceled.\n\nNearly 500 frontline healthcare workers planned to begin their strike Wednesday at three Maui Health locations: Maui Memorial Medical Center, Kula Hospital and L\u0101na\u02bbi Community Hospital. Those on strike include Maui Health respiratory therapists, transporters, housekeeping, laundry, nurse aides, ER techs, landscaping, bus drivers, cooks and others who are represented by United Public Workers AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO.\n\nDuring the first day of the strike, healthcare workers carried signs and circled the entrance to Maui\u2019s main hospital, Maui Memorial Medical Center, in Wailuku. Hundreds of staffers, many in scrubs, congregated at various entrances, with some dancing, waving, sitting or cheering.\n\nEven though she\u2019s not represented by the union on strike, Angela Weldon, a charge nurse on the hospital\u2019s fifth floor, joined the demonstration on her day off to show support.\n\nWeldon said the strike is being felt across the hospital.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD\n\n\u201cHells yeah it\u2019s going to have an impact,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to go to work tomorrow night and I\u2019m scared.\u201d\n\nValerie Sanchez, a surgical tech who works in the hospital\u2019s operating room, said that she and others are striking for better pay. Some co-workers, such as operating room housekeepers, don\u2019t even make $20 an hour, she said.\n\n\u201cAnd yet (my co-worker) is the one in most danger, who\u2019s dealing with all the blood and different things in the operating room after surgery \u2014 that\u2019s her cleaning it. They are the ones that break my heart. They work so hard,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWithout a clean operating room, we can\u2019t do surgery. Without clean instruments and sterilized instruments, we can\u2019t do surgery. So it\u2019s a whole team effort.\u201d\n\nPC: Kehaulani Cerizo\n\nAfter 97.6% of the union\u2019s Maui Health members voted to strike, the administration received a strike notice Feb. 10. Members are seeking better pay, reasonable shifts and other terms.\n\nMaleko McDonnell, communications manager for the union, said the overwhelming support to strike sends a \u201cstrong message.\u201d The staff has been overworked and underpaid through the pandemic, and now the members \u201chave had enough.\u201d\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD\n\n\u201cThey have very simple requests: They want fair pay. They want a wage that allows them to live in an apartment, not even own a house, just live in an apartment on Maui without having to work more than one job,\u201d he said.\n\nMcDonnell added that the hospital won\u2019t be able to continue to operate with a sizable reduction in staff.\n\n\u201cWhen any size business loses 500 employees to a picket, it\u2019s going to have a detrimental effect on day-to-day business,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long the hospital can continue to operate that way. I hope that the desired effect is they come to the table with a reasonable offer and with good intentions of actually reaching a deal. Because if they do, this ends immediately and we go right back.\u201d\n\nPC: Kehaulani Cerizo\n\nMaui Health in a news release later Wednesday said it doesn\u2019t know how long the strike will last.\n\nAlso, Maui Health echoed statements to reassure patients that services will not be disrupted during the strike.\n\n\u201cPatients in need of emergency medical care should not be deterred by strike activities,\u201d the news release said. \u201cAll appointments and outpatient procedures will continue as scheduled. If patients are concerned with their scheduled appointments, they should contact their physician providers.\u201d\n\nSafety measures have been put in place to ensure all entrances to hospitals and facilities remain open and accessible for employees and providers, patients and their visitors, the release added.\n\nMaui Health said it has a contingency plan in place to reduce any potential disruption to patient care and overall operations, which includes additional staffing including a labor pool, to assist in affected areas. Maui Health\u2019s Emergency Operations Center team meets multiple times a day to assess staffing needs, and deploy additional resources where needed, the release said.\n\nThe strike comes in the wake of a demonstration held by the union in December, which rallied for better pay.\n\nThis strike by Maui Health respiratory therapists, transporters, housekeeping, laundry, nurse aides, ER techs, landscaping, bus drivers, cooks and others represented by United Public Workers AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO, is separate from a 172-day strike by Kaiser mental health therapists throughout Hawai\u2019i.\n\nHawai\u2019i Kaiser mental health clinicians recently ended their strike with a vote to ratify a new three-year contract."

I use Naan bread when I don't have pizza crusts on hand. Add pesto, fresh slices or shreds of mozzarella and good quality tomatoes. Maybe some parmesan too.\"\n\nSriracha Sprinkle Seasoning Blend\n\nTrader Joe's has expanded its seasoning selection once again, but this time, it's transformed one of the most popular hot sauces into a powder, now available for $2.99. While the product's label recommends using the seasoning blend on noodle dishes, meat, tofu, soups, and egg dishes, social media users offered up their own suggestions.\n\nWithin the comments section of a recent Instagram post, users proposed sprinkling the new seasoning on popcorn, fries, roasted veggies, baked potatoes, and edamame with sesame oil.\n\nPerfectly Pickled Pups\n\nPickles and pigs in a blanket have come together in one food mashup. This new frozen item, available for $4.99, is made with mini uncured beef franks that have been coated in a dill pickle-flavored batter and breading.\n\nWhile some expressed that the product could use more pickle flavor, others had no critiques. \"These are 10 out of 10 in the air fryer! Insane!\" one Instagram user wrote."
