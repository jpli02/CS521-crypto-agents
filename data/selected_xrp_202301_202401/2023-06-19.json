        "content": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2013 Drowning doesn\u2019t discriminate, but Black children are three times more likely to drown than white children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Arkeisha Reese\u2019s 5-year-old son Kareem Green.\n\nKareem\u2019s summer camp went on a field trip when Reese got a phone call that changed her life forever.\n\nReese remembers her son as a child full of energy.\n\n\u201cKareem loved dinosaurs. He was playful, happy. His smile was everything,\u201d Reese said.\n\nBut 17 years ago, Reese experienced her worst nightmare.\n\nKareem Green drowned at 5 years old on a field drip during summer camp 17 years ago. (WJXT)\n\nShe said she got a phone call from Kareem\u2019s summer camp telling her to go to the hospital.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t moving, so at that moment, I knew something was wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know your child. So that\u2019s not him.\u201d\n\nKareem drowned while on a field trip.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what happened. I feel supervising him should have been done. Something went wrong,\u201d Reese said. \u201cI just miss him.\u201d\n\nKareem didn\u2019t know how to swim. At the time, Reese didn\u2019t either.\n\nShe said that inability was passed down from her mother.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t take us to swimming lessons,\u201d Reese said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take us much to the beach. So that\u2019s what happened to us. My sons, they didn\u2019t know how to swim.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a common experience for Black families nationwide.\n\nAccording to USA Swimming, 64% of Black children don\u2019t know how to swim.\n\n\u201cYou start to see a disparity that has everything to do with segregation,\u201d State Rep. Kevin Chambliss said.\n\nChambliss said past discrimination still affects Black communities when it comes to the water.\n\nState Rep. Kevin Chambliss is working on water safety legislation. (WJXT)\n\n\u201cFrom a cultural standpoint, we learned a lot of things, but water recreation began to not necessarily be a cultural norm in Black communities because Black communities weren\u2019t given access to water recreation that were in the cities that we were living in,\u201d he said.\n\nNews4JAX is looking into how racism and a history of segregation surrounding swimming pools create barriers that still exist today and play a part in the high drowning rates among the Black community and in the inability of many in the community to swim, leading to tragedies like the stories of Kareem and Jacksonville news reporter Hope Bartlett.\n\nRELATED: Mother of reporter who drowned on the job in 1998 also didn\u2019t know how to swim\n\nChambliss said making swim lessons free is one way to help prevent drowning.\n\n\u201cWe have to take the cost away. Because I think by having a cost associated with that, then you\u2019re going to have an economic gap between different communities on who knows how to swim and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d Chambliss said.\n\nReese is doing just that through the Team Kareem Memorial Foundation.\n\nShe offers free swim lessons and CPR classes statewide.\n\n\u201c\u2018I stand behind S.E.E., which is supervising, education and environment. Supervise first. Educate yourself, whether it be CPR, swimming lessons, lifeguard training,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019s also working with Chambliss on a water safety bill.\n\nIt would require childcare facilities to have written permission from parents for water-related activities and life jackets for children who can\u2019t swim.\n\nArkeisha Reese lost her 5-year-old son to drowning 17 years ago and now runs the Team Kareem Memorial Foundation to help other families avoid similar fates. (WJXT)\n\n\u201cIf they were to ask me those questions, or if they would have had life jackets on the premises, Kareem would have been here,\u201d Reese said.\n\nReese is hoping the changes will end the dangerous cycle.\n\nShe also had a message for families who have not made learning to swim a priority.\n\n\u201cYou could stop it. Right now, you don\u2019t have to do what your mom or your grandma did,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could start with your kids. Let\u2019s stop this generational curse. Please, you\u2019re hearing it from me, a mother who has lost her child. Make it a priority. Talk about swimming.\u201d\n\nChambliss said the water safety bill will be the first bill he files when the Legislature is back in session.\n\nReese plans to travel frequently to Tallahassee to hopefully see the bill become law.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Team Kareem Memorial Foundation, click here."

        "title": "XRP Army Finds Ripple Link To IMF, CBDC Platform - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "While the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that it is working on a platform for digital central bank currencies (CDBCs) yesterday, the XRP army has discovered an IMF report from March 2023 in which Ripple is considered a potential problem solver. Remarkably, the links between the IMF and Ripple Labs date back several years.\n\nIMF Plans CBDC Platform\n\nAs Reuters reported, the International Monetary Fund is planning a CBDC platform to enable transactions between countries.\n\n\u201cCBDCs should not be fragmented national propositions. To have more efficient and fairer transactions we need systems that connect countries. [\u2026] For this reason at the IMF, we are working on the concept of a global CBDC platform,\u201d IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Monday.\n\nShe also called for the world\u2019s central banks to agree on a common regulatory framework for digital currencies that would enable global interoperability. At the same time, she warned that cryptocurrencies could fill the vacuum if a common CBDC platform is not developed.\n\nGeorgieva highlighted the rapid pace at which CBDCs are being deployed around the world. Already 114 central banks are experimenting and studying CBDCs, \u201cwith about 10 having already crossed the finish line,\u201d the IMF director said.\n\nXRP Army Draws Links Between Ripple And IMF\n\nMeanwhile, the XRP army discovered a March 2023 report by the IMF titled \u201cTrust Bridges and Money Flows: A Digital Marketplace to Improve Cross-Border Payments\u201d, which mentions Ripple and XRP. The paper presents, among other things, a model for a global marketplace for more efficient cross-border exchange of tokenized money.\n\n\u201cThe model remains exploratory and is intended to lay an initial blueprint to encourage further scrutiny and debate,\u201d says the IMF report, which sees two key benefits in setting up a marketplace for tokenized money: interoperability and more cost-effective foreign exchange trading.\n\nThe interoperability part involves the transfer of money to a recipient in a domestic or cross-border context. The foreign exchange part is to be considered in a cross-border context and involves the exchange of one currency for another. According to the report, there are three conceivable models for a marketplace:\n\nA private settlement asset and marketplace, such as Ripple\u2019s XRP; an open source marketplace such as the Stellar Foundation\u2019s or, more recently, DeFi networks; and a marketplace and settlement asset based on unbacked crypto assets, such as Strike, which leverages Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.\n\nHowever, according to the authors, the public solution (like Ripple\u2019s) has decisive advantages as it could be operated by a regulated private entity. First, it would solve the coordination problem related to centralisation of participation and provision of liquidity; second, there would be clear and trustworthy governance and operational stability. Third, full compatibility with financial integrity standards would also be ensured.\n\nRemarkably, Ripple Labs\u2019 collaboration with the IMF goes back a few years. A November 2018 presentation by Sagar Sarbhai reveals that Ripple was selected for the High Level Advisory Group on Fintech. Chris Larsen, Executive Chairman of Ripple, is a member of the group.\n\nMoreover, the XRP army has dug up several videos in which Ripple was allowed to speak at IMF conferences in the past years.\n\n\ud83d\udca5RIPPLE\u2019S ANTOINETTE O\u2019GORMA PRESENTING TO THE IMF ON CYBERSECURITY/ XRP LEDGER + \u201cRIPPLE IS THE ONLY COMPANY THAT MONITORS AND REPORTS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY ON THE BLOCKCHAIN\u201d\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\udca5 pic.twitter.com/eDNegASKlh \u2014 ISO 20022\u2026.

        "title": "Ripple vs. SEC: Will the Legal Battle Finally End? - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "WEB3\n\nThe final ruling of the SEC-Ripple case will have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market, potentially establishing a precedent for the classification and regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nSEC Lawsuit Against Ripple\n\nIn December 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency. According to the SEC, Ripple sold unregistered securities and illegally raised $1.8 billion through the sale of XRP tokens.\n\nThe Ripple/SEC lawsuit has become one of the most significant conflicts between a cryptocurrency company and regulatory authorities. After more than a year of court hearings and motions, the case seems to be reaching a critical juncture. This article will explore the latest Ripple/SEC lawsuit developments and discuss the possible outcomes.\n\n\u200d\n\nRipple's Optimism and Legal Victories\n\nRipple has expressed confidence in its position despite the complexities of the legal battle. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple's Chief Legal Officer, shared the company's expectation that it would win the case against the SEC. Alderoty pointed out that the SEC had lost four out of its last five cases in the Supreme Court, suggesting that Ripple had a strong chance of prevailing in the lawsuit.\n\nAdditionally, Ripple has achieved significant victories in the courtroom, strengthening its defense. The court denied the SEC's request to access Ripple executives' personal financial records, ruling it irrelevant and intrusive. In its arguments, the SEC claimed that these records could provide evidence of XRP executives' financial motives. However, the court found this request to be irrelevant and excessively intrusive, marking another win for Ripple.\n\nFurthermore, the court confirmed Ripple's argument that the SEC failed to give fair notice that XRP's sale was a securities transaction. Ultimately, this decision may undermine the SEC's case. In particular, it argues that the SEC failed to adequately clarify the status of cryptocurrencies, resulting in regulatory grey areas for companies like Ripple.\n\nAnother notable win was when Judge Sarah Netburn granted Ripple access to the SEC's internal communications about Bitcoin and Ethereum. This move could shed light on the SEC's process of distinguishing securities from currencies, a crucial factor in the case.\n\n\u200d\n\nThe Hinman Documents and SEC's Handling of Speech\n\nA significant development in the Ripple-SEC lawsuit was the release of documents related to former SEC director William Hinman's 2018 speech. The documents revealed internal discussions within the SEC before Hinman stated that Ethereum was not a security. This revelation raised questions about the credibility of the SEC's position and the potential impact on the lawsuit.\n\nIn response to the release of the Hinman documents, Ripple called for an investigation into the SEC's handling of Hinman's speech. The company argued that the documents undermined the SEC lawyers' argument that the speech was solely Hinman's opinion and not official guidance. Ripple's move suggests a strategic attempt to challenge the SEC's credibility and strengthen its position in the lawsuit.\n\n\u200d\n\nProspects for Settlement and Final Ruling\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed optimism about a resolution to the lawsuit in 2023, according to a CNBC report. However, he emphasized that a settlement would require clarity on classifying XRP as a security. The SEC's view that most cryptocurrencies are securities leaves little room for a settlement, according to Garlinghouse.\n\nHowever, according to XRP lawyer John Deaton, the SEC has less than a 3% chance of winning against Ripple outright as the long-running lawsuit nears its end. Deaton predicts that Judge Torres will make a final decision on the rollercoaster lawsuit filed by the SEC by Sept. 30 this year. He called attention to a \"six-month list\" that district judges must submit to Congress. The list includes all summary judgments pending for more than six months.\n\nFurther, Former lawyer and SEC official Marc Fagel expressed doubts about the likelihood of a settlement, noting that it would probably have happened earlier if one were to occur. Further, Fagel noted that the impact of an injunction on future XRP sales remains controversial.\n\n\u200d\n\nPotential Ripple Effect on Global Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe Ripple-SEC lawsuit has entered its third calendar year, and the case seems to be approaching its resolution. Ripple has achieved significant legal victories and remains optimistic about its chances of prevailing against the SEC's claims. The release of the Hinman documents has raised questions about the SEC's handling of the case and its credibility.\n\nThe final result of the Ripple lawsuit could reverberate through the crypto market worldwide. Having a favorable legal outcome for Ripple could set an important legal precedent for other cryptocurrencies. It may lead to a rapid surge in crypto innovations and market activity.\n\nIn addition, the factors may result in a significant bull run for all holders of XRP tokens. It is estimated that the XRP price could reach its previous all-time high of $3.84 within hours of the court decision. In contrast, the most optimistic token holders expect the XRP coin to reach $21 by mid-2023 or early 2024, bringing investors huge returns. Ripple (XRP) is currently trading at $0.4896, up 1.32% in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap."

        "title": "XRP edges up as hedge fund manager sees $30 target achievable - FXStreet",
        "content": "XRP price has increased 6% over the weekend, reversing some of the losses seen last week, once traders digested the contents of the Hinman documents.\n\nCrypto fund manager Thomas Kralow set a bullish target of $30 for XRP, citing the altcoin\u2019s potential for higher market activity.\n\nXRP has seen 200% gain in value against Bitcoin since the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple at the end of 2020.\n\nXRP price recovered over the weekend after the release of the Hinman documents led to a broad sell-off of Ripple\u2019s token last week, as increasing uncertainty on how these papers can help the payment giant in its lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) weighed on the asset.\n\nThe token trades at $0.4870, early on Monday, up 5.8% from Friday\u2019s low of $0.4601, but still under the $0.53 region it moved before the release of the Hinman documents.\n\nSpeculation surrounding the release of the Hinman documents could push XRP price up to the $30 bullish target in the short term, Kralow Capital founder and manager Thomas Kralow says in an interview, few months ahead of a key ruling which is set to determine the fate of Ripple\u2019s token.\n\nThe release of Hinman documents on June 13, a key element in the legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple, as well as the reaction of the company\u2019s legal team has fueled speculation among XRP holders. Moreover, some of altcoin's on-chain indicators show that XRP is undervalued at the current price, $0.4870 at the time of writing.\n\nAlso read: XRP losses mount as traders digest Hinman documents\n\nXRP gains 200% in value against Bitcoin\n\nXRP price has declined significantly from its June 13 peak of $0.5661. The altcoin wiped out its gains as holders digested the contents of Hinman documents release. XRP holders are awaiting a ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple case and the outcome could make or break the altcoin\u2019s price trend.\n\nHowever, XRP has gained 200% in value against Bitcoin since the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple at the end of 2020. This development fuels a bullish thesis for XRP price recovery and hints at likely bullish trend reversal in the asset in the short term.\n\nXRP/BTC price chart\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the next key support is at $0.4518, a level that represents its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nThe altcoin\u2019s price has sustained above the $0.4500 level for over a month. If recent history repeats, XRP is likely to experience a rebound and recover from support at $0.4518.\n\nCrypto fund manager sets $30 target for XRP price\n\nXRP price is largely influenced by the SEC lawsuit against payment giant Ripple. The XRP holder community therefore closely watches the updates to determine the direction in which the altcoin is headed.\n\nIn response to the release of the Hinman documents, the contents of which are key to Ripple\u2019s defense against the SEC, XRP price rallied to $0.5649 on Tuesday. However, XRP price has settled below $0.4853 since then, wiping out its weekly gains.\n\nFind out more about Hinman documents here.\n\nThe three main factors fueling speculative narratives for XRP are: contents of the Hinman documents \u2013 internal messages and email exchanges among executives of the agency \u2013, SEC former Director William Hinman\u2019s comments on Ethereum in his 2018 speech and the regulator\u2019s stance on XRP as a security.\n\nThomas Kralow, crypto hedge fund manager at Kralow Capital, said to FXStreet that these factors could fuel further speculation, driving XRP price higher within the next three to four months.\n\nKralow weighed in on the rising interest among crypto market participants. Based on data from Google trends, searches for XRP have doubled in the last month, signaling an increase in interest among traders worldwide.\n\nKrakow told FXStreet:\n\nCurrently, we observe huge speculative narratives around Ripple, which could potentially lead to a significant price increase for XRP in the next three to four months, pushing its value to anywhere between $10 and $30.\n\nOver the past thirty days, XRP price climbed 15.32%, from $0.4190 to $0.4832 on Binance. Data from Google trends reveals further potential for market activity, Kralow says, setting a bullish target of $30 per token within the next three to four months.\n\nThe manager and founder of Kralow Capital identified two factors that could make or break XRP\u2019s rally within the next three months.\n\nRipple\u2019s IPO: Ripple and its executives have shared their desire to take the payment remittance firm public from time to time during the lawsuit. Ripple\u2019s IPO could act as a key milestone and a bullish catalyst for XRP price given the token is native to the giant\u2019s XRPLedger.\n\nRipple\u2019s win against the SEC: Ripple\u2019s win against the SEC, or a settlement between the two parties, drawing the conclusion that XRP isn\u2019t a security could propel the altcoin to a new all-time high.\n\nAccording to crypto influencers and Ripple proponents closely following the lawsuit, a ruling is expected before September 30 this year. XRP holders could expect an increase in demand closer to the ruling.\n\nKralow set a minimum of $10 and a cap of $30 as price targets for XRP ahead of the ruling.\n\nOn-chain metric signals XRP is undervalued\n\nThe Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is an on-chain metric that shows the ratio between the current price and the average price of a certain asset. The higher the MVRV ratio, the more profitable it is to sell the token at the current market price, giving an idea of how overvalued or undervalued an asset is.\n\nMVRV chart for XRP\n\nWith an MVRV ratio of -2.8% on Monday, XRP is undervalued at a price of $0.4870, implying there is bullish potential in XRP."
