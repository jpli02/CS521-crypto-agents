        "content": "The dramatic failure of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday will have a ripple effect that impacts the entertainment industry.\n\nAccording to multiple securities filings Friday, a number of companies with connections to the entertainment business had accounts at the bank. With the bank now in a receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., any deposits above the $250,000 threshold that the FDIC insures are in jeopardy until the FDIC figures out how to distribute the bank\u2019s assets.\n\nThat being said, so far none of the companies involved say that the failure of SVB should have a dramatic effect on their ability to operate.\n\nArguably the most impacted company so far is Roku, which said that it had $487 million at SVB, more than one fourth of its total cash holdings.\n\n\u201cAt this time, the Company does not know to what extent the Company will be able to recover its cash on deposit at SVB,\u201d Roku warned investors. That being said, the company said that the cash it is holding at other financial institutions, as well as its cash flow from operations, \u201cwill be sufficient to meet its working capital, capital expenditures, and material cash requirements from known contractual obligations for the next twelve months and beyond.\u201d\n\nOther companies impacted include the video production platform Vimeo, which said it had accounts at SVB. However, it said the total value should be covered by the FDIC. \u201cThe Company has a well structured and diverse set of banking partners with no bank holding over 25% of its total cash,\u201d the company said.\n\nAnd Roblox said that it had about 5 percent of its cash holdings at SVB, which would total about $150 million. \u201cRegardless of the ultimate outcome and the timing, this situation will have no impact on the day to day operations of the Company,\u201d it added.\n\nAnd FuboTV, the streaming pay-TV operator, filed with the SEC to say that yes, it is aware of SVB\u2019s failure, but that no, it does not have any bank accounts there.\n\nSVB had been America\u2019s 16th-largest bank until it was shuttered on Friday. It specialized in services to startups in and around Silicon Valley."

        "title": "How Companies Can Modernize Treasury Management - Ripple",
        "content": "The past few years have been rocky for treasury managers as geopolitical events brought new sanctions, COVID-19 slowed economic growth and raised interest rates, and supply chain frictions wreaked havoc on businesses around the world.\n\nAlthough traditional payment rails are making attempts at modernization, many businesses do not have the time or capital to wait for an antiquated global payments system to evolve into a more equitable playing field. Legacy payment rails disproportionately serve financial players who tend to have long-standing relationships with correspondent banks, as well as ample resources (both human and capital) to expand into new markets and properly manage international treasury flows.\n\nCompounding this, while it\u2019s well known that cross-border payments are messy and fractured, events in recent years have created siloed regional pockets that exacerbate challenges associated with global treasury management. Increased barriers have led to greater friction in cross-border payments, putting pressure on businesses to diversify suppliers and strategically alter trade corridors. This equates to taking on additional FX rates, establishing new banking relationships, and understanding and complying with new tax rules and regulations.\n\nAs the international payments landscape becomes ever more complex, treasury managers deserve a forward-thinking solution tailored to fit their business needs.\n\nStake Your Claim as a Multinational\n\nAlthough crypto can seem unapproachable, our Quick Guide: Streamline Global Treasury Flows helps untangle any preconceived notions by showcasing the real-world value that blockchain and crypto solutions have on businesses across the globe.\n\nFor example, gaining the ability to pay global vendors or suppliers in their local currency reduces one of the many pain points associated with doing business outside of domestic markets. This can strengthen relationships with third parties, improve operational efficiency and further solidify a business\u2019s footprint in a new region.\n\nTreasury managers are also responsible for understanding foreign corridors well enough to accurately predict the necessary flow of funds, moving the right amount of capital at the right time at the most optimized possible price for the business.\n\nBut there are some corridors\u2014like that of Southeast Asia, India, Brazil, and Mexico\u2014that prove particularly challenging to manage the flow of funds, even for major banks. With Ripple\u2019s global payments network, customers gain access to hundreds of new partners and financial institutions worldwide, without having to navigate these complex corridors.\n\nTap into New Opportunity\n\nData shows that emerging market economies average nearly 50% of global GDP. So there is clearly potential for businesses to thrive in these regions, but those that leverage crypto solutions to enter into new markets will be at an advantage, especially in complex corridors.\n\nWith a reduced need to prefund destination accounts and access to Ripple\u2019s global network, businesses can develop regional positions at their own pace and even explore growth opportunities in multiple locations at once at a fraction of the cost compared to legacy payment rails.\n\nCorporate treasury teams can also utilize blockchain and crypto solutions to improve cash flow planning and lower operational overhead, enhance commercial terms and even help suppliers factor their receivables. These technologies present a truly modernized solution that allows treasury managers to meet their business needs and expand into new markets without breaking the bank.\n\nDownload our Guide to learn more about streamlining internal treasury operations and growing your business."

        "title": "'This hit like a ton of bricks': Troubles at Silicon Valley Bank ripple across Boston tech scene - The Boston Globe",
        "content": "\u201cI am getting texts and e-mails from all over. We are getting bombarded,\u201d Adrian Mendoza, founder and general partner of Mendoza Ventures in Boston, said of his firm\u2019s companies that have accounts at SVB. \u201cThis is going to be tough on a lot of founders and startups, a lesson to be learned.\u201d\n\nOne of the largest and most influential bankers to the Boston-area startup community, SVB was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Friday and all accounts were frozen until Monday at the latest, when withdrawals will be limited to $250,000 per account.\n\nThe abrupt failure of Silicon Valley Bank and its takeover by federal regulators Friday sent a shock wave through the Boston technology and biotech communities, with companies and depositors unable to withdraw funds and facing the prospect of not being able to pay bills or make payroll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sudden failure, the second-largest in US history after Washington Mutual\u2019s 2008 downfall, was triggered by SVB\u2019s disclosure on Wednesday of growing losses on government bonds due to rising interest rates. The announcement prompted a run on the bank. As depositors withdrew their savings this week, the bank had to sell Treasury bonds it owned at a loss, eroding its capital.\n\nCustomers will get receivership certificates for balances above $250,000 and won\u2019t have immediate access to the funds unless the bank is quickly acquired by a healthy rival.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank referred requests for comment to the FDIC.\n\nAll of this means a potentially large swath of local companies \u2014 mostly privately held firms backed by venture capital \u2014 could have trouble funding their operations or making payroll.\n\n\u201cThis hit like a ton of bricks,\u201d said Michael Benezra, managing partner at Boston VC firm Erez Capital. \u201cThe way I describe it is a \u2018black swan\u2019 event. . . . I called a friend of mine on the West Coast. . . . People [were] waking up to their accounts basically being frozen and their bank going under.\u201d\n\nBenezra said two of his firm\u2019s seven portfolio companies banked with SVB but were able to switch over to Brex, a San Francisco-based financial company, before the FDIC seizure. He declined to name the two startups, but said they are not located in the Boston area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, some local firms started disclosing their exposure to the bank.\n\nIn filings with federal regulators, Ginkgo Bioworks said one of its subsidiaries had $74 million, or 6 percent of the company\u2019s total cash and cash equivalents, at the bank. X4 Pharmaceuticals said it had 2.5 percent of its cash with SVB.\n\nCryptocurrency firm Circle Internet Financial told the Globe that SVB was one of six banks it has used to hold the $11 billion of cash reserves for its USDC stablecoin, in addition to $32 billion kept in US Treasuries. On Friday night, the company said in a tweet it tried and failed to move $3.3 billion out of SVB by wire transfer. The tweet prompted a rare drop in the price of USDC, which is designed to maintain a stable price of $1, to a low of 88 cents on Saturday.\n\nOther companies, including Flywire and AirSculpt Technologies, filed disclosures on Friday indicating they have loans from the bank.\n\nSVB has a large office in downtown Boston and often hosts events on behalf of startups and venture capital firms. When the office opened in 2020, SVB said it had more than 250 employees in Boston and Newton working on tech and health care banking and related services. In 2021, SVB acquired Boston Private Bank & Trust, which caters to wealthy individuals and has branches in Boston, Cambridge, Wellesley, and Beverly.\n\nThe bank ranked 11th largest in Massachusetts, with $5.5 billion of deposits as of June 30, according to FDIC data.\n\nMichael Cannon, who identified himself as a business owner from Framingham, checked to see if he could access the ATM at the Wellesley branch of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, 2023. He was surprised that he could make a withdrawal. Barry Chin/Globe Staff\n\nThe Wellesley branch was closed on Friday, with the FDIC notice of seizure taped to the door. Guy Morris, who lives in Newton, tried to get access to his deposits on Friday afternoon but was thwarted. He said he kept his accounts below the FDIC insurance maximum but was worried about whether he would get access to his money for upcoming bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I had known about this, I would have taken all my money out yesterday,\u201d Morris said.\n\nVenture capitalists said they had been reluctantly urging their startups to pare back deposits at SVB in case the bank\u2019s downturn spiraled into a full-blown crisis. The advice came despite the bank\u2019s heavy involvement in supporting startups and after SVB chief executive Greg Becker on Thursday asked customers to remain loyal.\n\n\u201cStartups need to make sure they have backup plans and are planning for the worst-case scenario,\u201d Fady Saad, founder and general partner at Cybernetix Ventures in Boston, said he advised his portfolio companies. \u201cAt the same time, we wanted to avoid a domino effect. Silicon Valley Bank has been so supportive of our startups.\u201d\n\nMendoza, for one, lived through prior financial crises and had his firm\u2019s deposits spread among several banks, he said. But other companies were overreliant on SVB.\n\nAs the troubles became more evident at SVB on Thursday, a number of traditional banks began receiving inquiries from business customers about switching their accounts. Among them was Salem Five Bank, according to chief marketing officer Joe Bartolotta, who said his bank heard from a handful of SVB customers.\n\n\u201cThey were commercial customers looking for a safe place to store their money,\u201d Bartolotta said.\n\nMany smaller publicly traded banks, including some in the Boston area, got sucked into the downdraft as SVB\u2019s shares plunged amid investor concerns about the sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShares in Eastern Bank fell 9.9 percent from its Wednesday closing price to Friday\u2019s close, while Berkshire Bank shed 7.3 percent and Rockland Trust dropped 6.8 percent. Shares in First Republic Bank, a San Francisco-based bank with a big deposit base in Massachusetts, fell much further, in large part because its business model is more similar to SVB\u2019s than the others. Its shares were down nearly 29 percent over the two days.\n\nThe trouble started this week after SVB said it had lost $1.8 billion on bond investments and was raising a $2.25 billion capital infusion. The bank\u2019s assets ballooned during the previous years\u2019 runup in the tech market as startups raised billions of dollars and deposited it at the bank.\n\nIn addition to making loans, SVB invested much of its money in Treasury bonds that don\u2019t mature for years. With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, prices of the bonds have fallen. The bank paid about $120 billion for debt securities on its balance sheet, but those securities had a current market value of only $102 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022, the bank revealed in February in a filing with the FDIC.\n\nIf SVB could have held the bonds until maturity, that wouldn\u2019t matter. But the recent downturn in tech had customers withdrawing more funds, forcing the bank to sell its Treasuries at a loss. As fears about the bank\u2019s stability spread, more customers had withdrawn funds, triggering a vicious downward cycle that ended in SVB\u2019s takeover.\n\nNow, the bank\u2019s failure might further accelerate the tech downturn. That\u2019s because SVB not only holds deposits for many startups, but also loans them money and provides services such as helping fund-raise and publishing research on the tech market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously ridiculously important to have a banking partner that understands the needs of startups,\u201d said David Chang, a fixture of the Boston tech scene who worked with the bank on his prior startup and is now a general manager at recruiting firm Hunt Club. \u201cThey\u2019re going above and beyond the menu of things you pay for to respond to one-off requests startups make. You don\u2019t find that amount of agility at more established banks.\u201d\n\nGet Innovation Beat Boston Globe tech reporters tell the story of the region's technology and innovation industry, highlighting key players, trends, and why they matter.

        "title": "JWST\u2019s cosmic revelations will change our interior lives too - Aeon",
        "content": "Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing wonder and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.\n\n\u2013 from Critique of Practical Reason (1788) by Immanuel Kant\n\nEnlightenment philosophers were vexed that their expanding empirical science of the external, material world collided with long-standing religious and moral traditions premised solely on internal, a priori knowledge. But for Immanuel Kant, the \u2018sensible world\u2019 of appearances emerged from cognitive faculties of the human mind, constitutive of observations gained through human experience. \u2018We can cognize of things a priori only what we ourselves have put into them,\u2019 he wrote. Kant analogised his reframing of metaphysics to Copernicus\u2019s heliocentrism, in which the astronomer\u2019s observations made sense only when he placed the Sun, rather than Earth, at the centre. \u2018An object of the senses\u2019 like a new planet observed from a telescope, wrote Kant, \u2018conforms to the constitution of our faculty of intuition\u2019, resolving the perceived discrepancy between the observable world and the mind\u2019s contemplation of it.\n\nThe Enlightenment\u2019s radical political philosophy, shifting Europeans\u2019 governance from aristocratic absolutism to freedom gained through reason, dovetailed with Kant\u2019s philosophy of science. Observations of a band of stars that appeared to enring the sky led him to surmise that the solar system was shaped like a disc around the Sun. \u2018Matter [is] \u2026 bound to certain laws, and when it is freely abandoned to those laws, it must necessarily bring forth beautiful combinations,\u2019 he wrote in 1755. \u2018There is a God just because nature even in chaos cannot proceed otherwise than regularly and according to order.\u2019 A reasoned universe and a reasoned mind operated together.\n\nKant\u2019s \u2018sensible world\u2019 of the 18th century was Earth, the solar system and the stars in the sky. If Kant\u2019s philosophy holds true, then anticipated astrophysical phenomena of the observable cosmos must continue to be integrated into humans\u2019 self-emplacement in an ever-expanding internal universe as well. Increasingly sophisticated technologies of visual perception \u2013 from Galileo\u2019s spyglass to ground- and then space-based telescopes \u2013 mediate our entwined expanding astrophysical and moral universes.\n\nData from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) began returning images in July 2022, and is poised to deepen humans\u2019 sensibility of the cosmos and ourselves. Astronomers expect that it will reveal novel astrophysical phenomena both one step beyond the familiar and the presently unimaginable. With its 6.5-metre gold-coated primary mirror and unprecedented sensitivity to long infrared wavelengths, the telescope\u2019s deep field resolves distant star clusters in unparalleled detail. These images could help astronomers model the \u2018cosmic spring\u2019 that led to the formation of galaxies through gravitational mechanisms and life itself. The JWST could also pave the way to realise NASA scientists\u2019 long-quested goal to detect extraterrestrial life, expanding beyond microbes on the surface of Mars or in the Venusian atmosphere, which would shore up a generalised theory of biology and evolution. The apprehension of biosignatures \u2013 indications of life in exoplanetary atmospheres \u2013 would demand a reordering, not only of how humans perceive the Universe, but of ourselves as living, if perhaps not lonely, beings within it.\n\nThousands of galaxies flood this near-infrared image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, captured by JWST, 12 July 2022 (full image). Courtesy NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI\n\nThe cosmos as Kant understood it and cosmos as astronomers today understand it differ. The latter is more anticipated and sensible, but together they are just two points in a series of ruptures in humans\u2019 perception of conjoined physical and philosophical spacetimes.\n\nThese ruptures have unfolded chronologically and spatially in tandem. Each new scalar bound from the Earth \u2013 to the Moon, to the local solar system, to alien planets and galaxies, to the very fringes of the Universe \u2013 has prompted the reformation of our sense of being. To test how the discovery of nature orders the nature of discovery of ourselves, we time-hop to Renaissance Italy.\n\nGalileo Galilei improved on existing telescopes, and turned his spyglass to the heavens, writing of striking discoveries in his epochal treatise Sidereus Nuncius (1610), or \u2018Starry Messenger\u2019. Observing what a contemporary had dubbed the \u2018strange spottednesse\u2019 of the Moon, Galileo wrote that its surface was not \u2018smooth, uniform, and precisely spherical\u2019 but rather \u2018uneven, rough, and full of cavities and prominences, being not unlike the surface of the Earth.\u2019 As the art historian Samuel Y Edgerton, Jr describes it, Galileo, disciplining his eyes and hand through artistic practices flowering in Florence, rendered the Moon in both soft sepia watercolours and dramatic chiaroscuro engravings.\n\nGalileo\u2019s Moon \u2013 an imperfect body rife with craggy geologies, pockmarked by ancient collisions \u2013 related familiar terrestrial to unfamiliar lunar features, and required a symbolic reordering. Because the Catholic Church\u2019s Moon, upon which the Virgin Mary reigned, referenced the Immaculate Conception, Galileo\u2019s depiction called into question the concept of the Moon \u2013 and therefore God\u2019s universe \u2013 as perfect and pure. Galileo had corrupted Dante\u2019s \u2018eternal pearl\u2019, and the new Moon\u2019s representation came to enter religious frescoes \u2013 a tacit if wary acceptance of a morphing moral order.\n\nAll images from Sidereus Nuncius (1610), or \u2018Starry Messenger\u2019, by Galileo Galilei\n\nNext, in careful logs over December 1609 and January 1610, Galileo reported curious pricks of light gambolling about the planet, \u2018four planets never seen from the beginning of the world.\u2019 Upon observing only two celestial bodies on the 11th night, Galileo \u2018mov[ed] from doubt to astonishment\u2019: he realised that the objects were not fixed, independent stars, but instead orbited at \u2018marvellous speed around the star of Jupiter\u2019.\n\nGalileo\u2019s findings came to radically disrupt humans\u2019 perception of their world\n\nWe now know these objects as the moons Io, Europa, Ganymede and Calisto, and NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is planning to send a probe to Europa in 2024 to investigate the possibility of life in its watery oceans. But four centuries ago, Galileo hastened an insuperable fracture of entwined astrophysical and moral beliefs. Further substantiating Copernicus\u2019 model, Galileo fatally destabilised the prevailing geocentrism that the Church had held for centuries.\n\nThis time, the Church met Galileo\u2019s observations with explicit resistance, imperilling his carefully constructed position in nuanced Italian court politics. The historian of science Mario Biagioli describes how Galileo had, initially, ingeniously manipulated the tides of power in the Florentine court, leveraging his astronomical discoveries to fashion himself as a philosopher (not a mere mathematician of lower social grade). By dubbing the moons the \u2018Medici planets\u2019, he augmented that family\u2019s supposedly God-given mythology. But in 1633, the Roman Court found Galileo \u2018vehemently suspected of heresy, namely for having held and believed a doctrine which is false and contrary to the divine and Holy Scripture: that the Sun is the centre of the world and does not move from east to west, and the Earth moves and is not the centre of the world.\u2019 Galileo was condemned to house arrest for the remainder of his life.\n\nBiagioli attributes the \u2018fall of the favourite\u2019 to fickle papal dynamics rather than merely to religious or scientific resistance. In Kant\u2019s parlance, Galileo\u2019s freshly \u2018sensible\u2019 moons could not be reconciled with short-sighted power struggles. Nevertheless, Galileo\u2019s findings came to radically disrupt humans\u2019 perception of their world. A half-century later, Sir Isaac Newton reworked Galileo\u2019s findings in his monumental Principia (1687). \u2018The motions of the planets, the comets, the Moon, and the sea,\u2019 Newton wrote, \u2018are deduced from these forces by propositions that are also mathematical.\u2019 He decisively located gravity as an empirical description of all objects and a fundamental theory even beyond the observable world. The laws of motion governed not only humans\u2019 relationship to objects in their world and their place on Earth, but alien bodies outside of immediate perceptibility.\n\nTime-travel three centuries to the Harvard College Observatory in 1912, when the \u2018computer\u2019 Henrietta Swan Leavitt earned 30 cents an hour to determine stellar brightness, positions and movements over time. Although the observatory\u2019s director Edward Pickering \u2018chose his staff to work, not to think,\u2019 Leavitt\u2019s tedious labour afforded her intimate familiarity with the photographic plates. Partially deaf, her visual immersion let her track the stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (objects we now know to be dwarf galaxies, macerated and then regurgitated by the Milky Way). Leavitt formulated the relation between the length of a \u2018Cepheid variable star\u2019s\u2019 brightening and dimming to precise time intervals, leading astronomers to calculate not only their distance from Earth but the scale of the galaxy.\n\nBy the 1920s, astronomers debated if the Milky Way galaxy contained the whole of the cosmos or if spiral nebulae were their own separate \u2018island universes\u2019 \u2013 a distinction that would define the scope of the cosmos. Edwin Hubble used the world\u2019s most powerful telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory near Los Angeles to study the Andromeda \u2018spiral nebula\u2019 in unprecedented resolution. In a now-famous image, Hubble crossed out the \u2018N\u2019 and replaced it with \u2018VAR!\u2019 as he realised that the \u2018nova\u2019 star was actually a \u2018variable\u2019 star; calculating its distance from Earth, he realised that Andromeda was too far away to be incorporated into the Milky Way. We might read Hubble\u2019s \u2018!\u2019 as a punctuation of surprise as he too \u2018mov[ed] from doubt to astonishment\u2019: his galaxy was surely just one of many that populated a vast cosmos.\n\nEdwin Hubble\u2019s photographic plate of Andromeda, 1923. Courtesy of the Carnegie Institution for Science\n\nLeavitt lent Hubble the means to harness a sophisticated telescopic technology to amplify natural \u2018sensibility\u2019, but her foundational insight was hard-won. Pickering glossed over Leavitt\u2019s contributions, publishing the results in his name; similarly, the Harvard astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin\u2019s work on stellar atmospheres \u2013 later hailed as \u2018the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy\u2019 \u2013 was diminished and then co-opted by her advisor Henry Russell. But the astronomical contributions of Leavitt, Payne-Gaposchkin and others eventually led to a progressive social perception: that women could research the cosmos on equal ground with their male colleagues.\n\nHubble returned spectacular \u2018baby pictures\u2019 of the Eagle Nebula\u2019s \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019\n\nNASA honoured Hubble decades later with the eponymous telescope that launched into outer space in 1990. Its grand mission was to research black holes, the solar system and, through its unparalleled sensitivity to visible wavelengths, the most distant galaxies in the Universe. But there was an issue: the telescope returned fuzzy images. After five missions to outer space, astronauts repaired the mirror, which NASA described as \u2018fix[ing] the flaw much the same way a pair of glasses correct[s] the vision of a near-sighted person.\u2019 In 1995, the now beloved and long-lived telescope returned spectacular \u2018baby pictures\u2019 of the Eagle Nebula\u2019s \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019 \u2013 billowing columns of gas and dust that are inchoate stars.\n\nThe Pillars of Creation.

Astronomers confirmed that matter is evenly distributed at very large scales, further evidence of an expanding and cooling post-Big Bang universe. Though scientists had suspected the prevalence of black holes in the Universe, they learned from Hubble images that supermassive black holes cluster at the centre of galaxies.\n\nHubble ultra deep field, 3 June 2014.

Astronomers used the data to unveil Pluto\u2019s minuscule moon Styx, to analyse the aurorae around Ganymede and infer its saltwater ocean, and even to fortuitously catch the Refsdal supernova\u2019s overpowering luminescence as the star explodes and dies. The Hubble telescope was also crucial to astronomers\u2019 observations of distant supernovae in 1998 that revealed that the Universe is not only expanding, but accelerating. The mysterious \u2018dark energy\u2019 pushes spacetime to the unfathomable sublime, and accounts for about two-thirds of the Universe, forcing physicists to fundamentally rethink cosmological models.\n\nComing out of the 1970s, particle physicists struggled to unify cosmological theories to describe all matter in the Universe. Recalling his days as a graduate student, the physicist Alan Guth at MIT tells me he was driven by the assumption that \u2018nature was governed by a strong sense of simplicity.\u2019 But the observable Universe (its density, its composition) wasn\u2019t matching the theoretical models, leading Guth to develop the concept of cosmic inflation: the early Universe had undergone exponential expansion from 10-36 to around 10-32 seconds after the Big Bang, accounting for density fluctuations that led to the large-scale structure of galaxies and, ultimately, the physical conditions for life.\n\nCosmic inflation strongly supported the Big Bang explanation. Data from NASA satellites in the 1990s further confirmed what the physicists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson had detected in 1964 \u2013 the crackle of microwave radiation that is the afterglow of the Big Bang. In 1992, scientists used satellite data from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) to announce that they had evidence of temperature fluctuations in the early Universe that had led to the creation of gravity, allowing matter to clump together and form galaxies, stars and planets. Before, Guth explained, \u2018you could choose to believe the thermal spectrum if you wanted to.\u2019 But, he adds, \u2018it was pretty easy not to because the data was so scattered.\u2019\n\nThe data made a connection between the beginning of light 13 billion years ago and the origin of matter\n\nGuth remembers that the COBE\u2019s \u2018absolutely gorgeous data changed cosmology overnight from being a speculative exercise to a precision science. It really was spectacular.\u2019 David Kaiser, also an MIT physicist who collaborates with Guth, notes how special that moment was back in 1992, when Kaiser was a senior at Dartmouth College and the faculty raised a Champagne toast. \u2018It was so unusual \u2013 this moment of awe \u2013 that these fluctuations had been measured at all, let alone relatively convincingly, let alone in a pattern so consistent with what Alan [Guth] and others had calculated a decade in advance.\u2019 At a lecture at Vassar College in 2016, the Nobel Prize winner John Mather, who led the mission, told the audience (myself included!) that, when the COBE image was revealed, it received a standing ovation, cheers and tears.\n\nMinute fluctuations in the temperature of light in a very young Universe. Courtesy ESA, NASA, JPL-Caltech and the WMAP mission\n\nThe above images display minute fluctuations in the temperature of light from when the Universe was very young. The patterns of slightly hotter (in yellow or orange) and slightly cooler (slightly blue or green) temperatures give evidence to cosmic inflation. The COBE (top left) was just the beginning of cosmology as a \u2018precision science\u2019; data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), launched in 2001 (top right), and the Planck satellite, launched in 2009 (bottom), let astrophysicists describe shape, density, size and rate of expansion of the Universe in ever-increasing detail.\n\nThe profound effects of these data extended beyond the physics community because they helped make a connection between the beginning of light about 13 billion years ago and the origin of matter, the stuff not only of superclusters of galaxies, but of human DNA, a butterfly\u2019s wing, a blue whale. \u2018We are in essence formed from little quantum ripples in the sky,\u2019 mused Kaiser. Cosmic inflation links the unfathomably small and swift with the magnificently grand and long-lasting. The bubbling quantum world only a trillionth of a second old scales to the cobwebs of galactic superstructures that developed over billions of years. Reconciling the physical mechanics of two worlds \u2013 the quantum and the cosmological \u2013 could unlock answers to the future of the Universe and life on worlds beyond Earth.\n\nAs recently as 1992, although Earthlings could see the myriad stars that pricked the night sky and had long dreamed about other worlds beyond Earth, astronomers had not yet confirmed if our Sun was unique in hosting planets. But, as of February 2023, astronomers had detected 5,250 exoplanets, mostly through the Kepler space telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). These telescopes use the transit method, in which an exoplanet crossing the face of its host star causes that star to dim. Astronomers calculate the planet\u2019s diameter, orbital period and temperature \u2013 characteristics to evaluate a planet\u2019s Earthliness. As a graduate student in the 1990s, the exoplanet hunter Sara Seager at MIT pioneered a technique to study atmospheres of planets as they transited and were backlit by their star. One goal of JWST is to home in on these atmospheres for potential biosignatures.\n\nThis process is far from straightforward. Even in our own solar system, the methane on Mars is not a biosignature; we haven\u2019t linked ingredients of life to an actual detection of life. This summer, Seager\u2019s team will use the JWST to observe TRAPPIST-1, a system 40 lightyears away. If the astronomers get incredibly lucky, they could speculatively use the JWST\u2019s spectrometer (a device that separates light into distinct wavelengths to determine the atmosphere\u2019s chemicals) to observe the transits, establish the existence of an atmosphere, and infer extant water vapour. \u2018That would be a giant milestone: just knowing that there\u2019s one or more rocky planets with water oceans,\u2019 Seager told me. The JWST could offer tantalising hints to life beyond Earth. \u2018We might not get there, but we\u2019re the ones who can first really be on the doorstep of actually doing that.\u2019 With the next instrument, scientists might be able to walk through.\n\nThe variety of detections from outer-space telescopes has prompted astronomers to imagine unfamiliar combinations of alien suns and exoplanets where life could be otherwise. The JWST promises to spark at least as many questions about cosmological richness as it attempts to answer. The astrobiologist Sara Walker at Arizona State University told me: \u2018We\u2019re realising how little we know about these exoplanets, and how limited our ability to infer, even from very obvious features in atmospheric spectra, other characteristics.\u2019 The JWST will study exoplanetary atmospheres that could be similar in composition to Earth\u2019s (mostly nitrogen and oxygen) but that would be scant evidence for living processes.\n\nThere may be alternative pathways for exoplanets to have developed life, including ones without liquid water\n\nInstead, for Walker, JWST is an instrument that will set the stage for re-perceiving a deeply complex process that results in what we now call life. \u2018We\u2019ve had this fixation on looking for the molecules,\u2019 Walker explained, \u2018but we need to start looking for a theory of life that is about more than complexity, information or evolution.\u2019 Using Earth as a foil for the extraterrestrial, Walker says: \u2018When I characterise our planet as one with life on it, I say that our planet has 4 billion years of acquired memory.\u2019 Successor instruments might go beyond mere spectra to be able to detect causal structures of living processes. \u2018We need new ways of seeing,\u2019 she told me, \u2018and they may not be the same kinds of technologies of perception we had before.\u2019\n\nPenny Boston, the former director of NASA\u2019s Astrobiology Institute, came to the concept of \u2018weird life\u2019 \u2013 life as we don\u2019t yet know it \u2013 through her work in caves. \u2018Caves [often] have a very particular aroma,\u2019 she told me, from microorganisms. Bacteria, archaea, fungi, yeast and \u2018other weird things that are perched on borders between these groups\u2019 express the \u2018beautiful choreography of an ecosystem \u2026 that\u2019s just as perfectly complex as an Amazon rainforest.\u2019 These eclectic ecosystems suggest that there may be alternative pathways for exoplanets to have developed life, including ones without liquid water as a solvent. The JWST data on exoplanetary atmospheres and planet formation, complementary to, or divergent from, Earth\u2019s pathway, could yield a generalised theory of life. \u2018Candidate properties can be eventually applied to exoplanets and also other bodies in the solar system.\u2019\n\nThe meaningfulness of JWST data go beyond what new insights might be gained from the images alone. \u2018While the images themselves are striking and allow us to look at new things in the Universe, it\u2019s also about the introspective process,\u2019 Walker told me. \u2018It\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re part of a physical system, on a tiny planet, that can build a machine that allows us to see so deeply into the Universe that, to me, is the most profound feature of those images.\u2019 Extended external \u2018sensibility\u2019 leads to new modes of human self-perception as intelligent, technological, self-conscious Earthlings that are imbricated with, and contributors to, our planet\u2019s \u2018acquired memory\u2019.\n\nLeaping from the Moon, our solar system, the Milky Way, to secret pockets of outer space, I have told a story of an expanding universe of knowledge shaded by empirical, social and philosophical reformations. Galileo saw far-flung moons twirling and twinkling around Jupiter, further disrupting ancient cosmologies that placed Earth at the centre of all things. Leavitt\u2019s creation of a cosmic yardstick aided Hubble to evince the vastness of outer space. And astronomers\u2019 use of the Hubble Telescope unveiled unsettling mysteries about the long future of the cosmos.\n\nLast summer, the JWST alighted 1 million miles away from Earth. Astronomers held their breath as NASA engineers sent commands to the telescope to unfurl its tennis court-sized sunshield and puzzle together its aureate, honeycombed-shaped mirrors. Each of the sunshield\u2019s membrane layers are as thin as a human hair. As you read this, photons that have travelled billions of lightyears are streaming onto the JWST\u2019s mirrors, extending the gaze of astronomers to just 100 million years after the Big Bang. They will analyse this ancient light at the edge of time, perhaps to link how black holes might have helped shape galaxies, a question that the Hubble Telescope posed but left unanswered. They tilt the JWST\u2019s mirrors to peer closely at habitable planets, perhaps like Earth \u2013 rocky, watery, lively \u2013 that extraterrestrial humans might travel to in the future.\n\nAlthough Kant erroneously postulated in the mid-18th century that \u2018elevated classes of rational creatures\u2019 inhabited Jupiter and Saturn, his prediction that extraterrestrials exist might not be wrong. By extending, clarifying and amplifying their ability to \u2018see\u2019, astronomers have stretched their sensibility to otherworldly objects. Before and after Kant\u2019s writings, detections have shifted humans\u2019 perception of the natures of the Universe and posed further conundrums. We might therefore compare the accumulation of knowledge not to the linear arrow of time moving teleologically but instead to scalar expansion of the Universe; here, like a balloon being filled, each point represents a centre. Each centre point might be lensed by a novel tool of perception, like a spectrometer or prism, to see light differently and illuminate our perception of the cosmos. Such lenses abet ever-changing theories about the stuffs and spacetimes on, and beyond, Earth."
