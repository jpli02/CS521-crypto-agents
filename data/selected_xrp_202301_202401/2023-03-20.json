        "content": "The Twitter account of one of the leading news channels in India \u2013 News24 \u2013 became a victim of a recent cryptocurrency scheme. Hackers breached their security to post phishing links of a fake XRP drop, urging people to click and potentially get conned.\n\nCrypto scammers have previously compromised the Twitter account of India\u2019s Prime Minister \u2013 Narendra Modi \u2013 and the profiles of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA), and Mann Deshi Mahila Bank.\n\nThe Latest Victim in India\n\nWrongdoers took control of News24\u2019s Twitter account and posted counterfeit Ripple events, such as an XRP airdrop. They attached compromised links regarding and even featured the image of Ripple\u2019s CEO \u2013 Brad Galinghouse \u2013 to gain people\u2019s trust.\n\nNeedless to say, there was no such airdrop, hinting that some of the 1.4 million followers of News24 might have become victims of the scam.\n\nSome fake announcements are still visible on the outlet\u2019s Twitter account, meaning it has either not noticed the issue or has struggled to cope with the attackers.\n\nIndia has recently emerged as a hotbed for such scams. Hackers compromised the official Twitter profile of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the end of 2021 and published a malicious post that the country has adopted bitcoin as legal tender and that the government has purchased 500 BTC, which will distribute to the population.\n\nIt remained unknown how many people fell victim to the scam, but their number could have been substantial, considering that Modi has over 87 million followers.\n\nBad actors stepped in again a month later, breaching the security of the Twitter accounts of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA), and Mann Deshi Mahila Bank. They shared several tweets featuring Elon Musk, who seemingly promoted cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Fake Arbitrum Airdrops\n\nAs CryptoPotato recently reported, cryptocurrency participants should be cautious about another scam related to the Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution \u2013 Arbitrum.\n\nScammers flooded the space with fake airdrops of the project and phishing websites which, upon clicking, can lead to financial loss for users. Arbitrum News DAO said it detected over 270 such sites.\n\nRecall that the actual ARB token airdrop will occur on March 23. Consumers can view all necessary details and check their eligibility here."

        "title": "Ripple v. SEC court case update as of March 20, 2023 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The crypto community is eagerly awaiting the possible summary judgment date in the Ripple lawsuit fronted by the Securities Exchanges Commission (SEC). As a recap, legal experts had speculated that the matter might be determined in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIn the meantime, various legal practitioners are offering predictions regarding the possible outcome in the case and the judgment\u2019s overall implication on the crypto space. Under the latest update, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton in a tweet on March 19, has maintained that the controversial Hinman documents will be eventually made public despite the SEC\u2019s objection.\n\nAccording to Deaton, the documents relating to former SEC official William Hinman will be unsealed regardless of the decision by presiding judge Analisa Torres. He noted that the judge would rely on the documents to make her judgment and, in the process, declare them \u201cjudicial documents\u201d and order them to be unsealed.\n\n\u201cRegarding the Hinman emails and speech drafts: the SEC has requested for them to remain sealed, even after Judge Torres\u2019 ruling on summary judgment. I believe the emails and speech drafts will be made public at some point, regardless of Judge Torres\u2019 decision on whether to seal,\u201d he said.\n\nRelevance of Hinman documents in other litigations\n\nThe attorney added that the documents are relevant because they might be required to be used in other litigations, such as the lawsuit against Dragonchain. Notably, Dragonchain is an ERC20 token governed by the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and has active litigation. In this regard, Deaton believes Dragonchain will seek to obtain the emails and drafts to build their defense.\n\nMeanwhile, Deaton had earlier faulted the SEC for naming Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen in its lawsuit, terming it an \u2018error.\u2019 Deaton argued that the SEC ought to have concentrated its attention exclusively on Ripple, instead of going after individuals who were not directly accountable for the purported securities infringements.\n\nAmid the speculations regarding the case\u2019s outcome, Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty had welcomed the court\u2019s ruling on the \u201cDaubert\u201d motions. In the ruling, the judge failed to grant and deny portions of each party\u2019s motions in relation to striking out expert witnesses.\n\nOn the other hand, U.S. lawyer Jeremy Hogan had previously suggested that judge Torres may have already decided whether XRP is a security. As a reminder, the SEC is suing Ripple for selling XRP tokens without getting relevant approvals from the agency.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nAs the crypto community turns to focus on the case outcome, XRP continues to record gains aligning with the general market price movement. By press time, XRP was valued at $0.39 with daily gains of about 0.6%.\n\nThe token is currently controlling a market capitalization of about $19.55 billion. Overall, XRP has attracted increased capital inflow in the past week, with the value peaking at $20.3 billion on the weekly chart.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
