        "content": "Advertisement\n\nOn Thursday, XRP-focused account @XRP_Productions posted a tweet pondering if XRP cold be likened to legendary 1980s actor Bruce Campbell, known mainly for his role as Ash Williams in the original \"Evil Dead\" trilogy by Sam Raimi and the film series \"Ash vs Evil Dead\" of 2013.\n\nNow, there is a new film in the reanimated franchise coming out in theaters, but this time with Campbell only as a producer \u2013 \"Evil Dead Rise.\"\n\n#EvilDeadRise has been spreading fear across the country, and it\u2019s coming for you next \ud83d\ude08 Evil Dead Rise is Now Playing Only in Theaters. Get Tickets Now! Link in Bio pic.twitter.com/zqesjNpxiI \u2014 Evil Dead (@EvilDead) April 26, 2023\n\nXRP likened to original Evil Dead main actor\n\n@XRP_Productions posted a screenshot with somebody speculating on this topic on the internet. It says that \"comparing a digital asset to a B-move actor or actress is an interesting analogy.\" The anonymous author then continues that if he were to compare XRP to such an actor, it would be Bruce Campbell.\n\nThe author states that similar to Bruce having become successful with the cult classics \"Evil Dead,\" XRP, the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, \"gained a following among a niche group of investors and individuals.\"\n\nHe then moved on to Campbell's success in mainstream movies like \"Spider Man\" and \"Oz the Great and Powerful,\" likening that to the success of XRP in the mainstream, reached thanks to Ripple's partnerships with major companies such as American Express and MoneyGram.\n\n\"Overall the comparison between XRP and Bruce Campbell might not be perfect but there are definitely some similarities between the two,\" the author of the post concluded.\n\nRipple CTO comments on comparison\n\nDavid Schwartz, Ripple CTO and XRPL co-founder (the blockchain on which XRP runs) commented on the above-mentioned post. Schwartz stated jokingly that he had never before seen a photo of the first XRPL validator hardware prototype.\n\nHere, he posted a picture of a bicycle with a chainsaw installed below the handlebar, a saw similar to what Ash used in the Evil Dead films and that was fixed to his arm as a replacement of his self-amputated right hand."

        "title": "Ripple Has Bought Nearly $11B in XRP Since SEC Lawsuit - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ripple has continued to pour billions of dollars into its own cryptocurrency XRP, spending almost $2.6 billion on the token last quarter.\n\nThe firm \u2014 still embroiled in a tense SEC battle over the securities status of XRP \u2014 netted slightly more by selling XRP over-the-counter, pulling in more than $2.9 billion throughout Q1.\n\nThat means Ripple directed cash equal to 88% of quarterly XRP sales revenue towards buying the cryptocurrency on secondary markets. It spent 6% less than the previous period.\n\nXRP jumped about 60% across Q1, buoyed by similar rallies for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).\n\nRipple\u2019s net XRP sales were worth around $361 million last quarter, with tokens going to customers utilizing its blockchain-powered payments rails, which it calls \u201cOn-Demand Liquidity\u201d (ODL).\n\nRipple\u2019s ODL is a different system to its new bank-focused settlement protocol RippleNet, which due to current regulatory concerns cannot support XRP as yet.\n\nRipple sells XRP to ODL users in transactions that don\u2019t directly impact prices on crypto exchanges. It stopped selling XRP programmatically back in 2019.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP buying and selling fell slightly this quarter, but both still way up on 2021\n\nThe San Francisco-headquartered firm began buying XRP one year later, Blockworks previously reported. At the time, Ripple stated it was doing so to \u201csupport healthy markets.\u201d\n\nSince then, Ripple has dramatically ramped up its XRP purchases \u2014 which do interact with crypto exchange prices \u2014 despite its high-profile run-in with the SEC.\n\nXRP traded for $0.22 shortly after the SEC\u2019s lawsuit went public, but rallied up to 700% during the 2021 bull market. It\u2019s now hovering around $0.47.\n\nStill, the exact impact of Ripple\u2019s market activity on XRP\u2019s price remains unclear. Blockworks has reached out to Ripple for comment.\n\n\u201cSince 2020, Ripple has sourced XRP from the open market to ensure there is a sufficient supply of XRP available for our growing ODL business,\u201d Ripple said in its disclosure.\n\n\u201cWe continually strive to minimize undue market impact with our purchases by, for example, limiting how much and from whom we purchase XRP.\u201d\n\nRipple briefly stopped buying XRP amid US banking crisis\n\nRipple has now spent $10.9 billion on buying XRP since the SEC filed charges against the firm and its executives in Dec. 2020. The SEC alleges Ripple\u2019s historic XRP sales constituted a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering.\n\nRipple had only disclosed $80.4 million in XRP purchases until that point.\n\nRipple\u2019s buys coincide with a huge boost in ODL-related sales, now at $14 billion since the SEC\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nRipple has effectively recycled 78% of its XRP sales revenue to buy the token on secondary markets since the allegations first broke.\n\nThe firm said that it paused its XRP buying for \u201cseveral days\u201d due to the US banking crisis in March.\n\n\u201cThis activity has since resumed and the company expects to continue to undertake purchases as ODL adoption grows,\u201d Ripple said in its disclosure.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Colorado River plan could trigger unprecedented supply cuts - University of Southern California",
        "content": "Earlier this month, the Biden administration proposed a plan to distribute cuts from the Colorado River and resolve the centurylong legal dispute between states across the American Southwest that share its water supplies.\n\nDecades of drought and overuse have brought the river\u0092s water levels to historic lows. States in the Lower Colorado River Basin \u0097 Arizona, California and Nevada \u0097 now must choose between one of three options proposed by the federal government.\n\nThe outcome of these talks will have far-reaching implications for agriculture and energy in the region. The Colorado River provides water for over 40 million Americans and 30 Tribal Nations, fuels hydropower resources in eight states and supports agriculture across the region.\n\n(Story continues after video)\n\n\u0093Food, energy and water tend to be regulated separately, which can be problematic. You can\u0092t change policy in one of these areas without impacting the others,\u0094 says Robin Craig, professor of law at the USC Gould School of Law.\n\n\u0093The Biden administration\u0092s proposed options for dealing with the continuing Colorado River shortages capture the essential water dilemma for the West as a whole: Do we continue to honor historical patterns of water use in the West, or do we invoke principles of equity and a need to reassess what the Southwest is doing with that water?\u0094\n\nOption 1: Equal cuts across the Lower Basin states\n\nEqual cuts to water allocations across the Lower Basin states would represent an unprecedented break with legal tradition that has served as the bedrock of water law in the West for over a century.\n\nThe region follows what is known as prior appropriation law, which stipulates that whoever first accessed the water and put it to beneficial use is granted senior water rights. California is the senior water rights holder on the Colorado River system and is first in line to receive its annual allotment, much to the chagrin of the other states.\n\n\u0093These water rights endure forever, and in the southwestern U.S., they tend to be locked up in agriculture,\u0094 says Craig. \u0093In fact, about 80% of the water rights in the Southwest are for agriculture, and that plays into how flexible you can be in the Colorado River water distribution.\n\n\u0093Cutbacks across the board might work for the Colorado River itself, but within the states we will still have prior appropriation to deal with. A large pot of money to spend on transitioning the entire system seems not to be on the table.\u0094\n\nCalifornia officials have spoken out against this plan, arguing that it sidesteps existing water laws that respect the state\u0092s status as senior water rights holder.\n\nUnder this plan, California farmers \u0097 particularly those in the Imperial Valley \u0097 and consumers would be hit hardest.\n\nThe Imperial Valley is the largest producer of alfalfa, or hay forage, for California dairy cows and an important source of nutrients during the winter months, explains Shon Hiatt, an associate professor of business administration at the USC Marshall School of Business. A drop in the state\u0092s water allocation would reduce the amount of alfalfa produced since it is the least profitable crop.\n\nHiatt, an expert in global energy and agribusiness, says that an across-the-board cut to water supplies would mean higher prices for dairy products.\n\n\u0093California dairies have been struggling due to increased regulatory costs and the destruction of 60% of grazing pasture this winter due to flooding. The situation will be made worse if less alfalfa is grown and would result in higher dairy product prices in the state.\u0094\n\nOption 2: Cuts based on water rights seniority\n\nUnder this plan, California would retain its senior water rights to Colorado River water, with the strictest cuts imposed on Arizona and Nevada.\n\n\u0093In this scenario, California wins in the Lower Basin of the Colorado River \u0097 but the entire Lower Basin needs to get creative about how to free up water from agriculture without putting farmers out of business or losing food security. In other words, become more efficient about agriculture,\u0094 says Craig.\n\nOption 3: Do nothing\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior lists this \u0093No Action Alternative\u0094 as one of three options in its recent proposal.\n\nExperts warn that doing nothing would prove disastrous for the Colorado River and the regional economy.\n\nRegardless of how the states and federal government decide to move forward, doing nothing would mean keeping the Colorado River on the fast track to dead pool, or levels where water would no longer flow downstream and through the major dams, which generate enough hydroelectricity to power the homes of 1.3 million Americans in the region."
