Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRipple chief technology officer David Schwartz has taken to Twitter to share another comment on the recent controversial update of the Ledger wallet and answered a question about how he himself prefers to store cryptocurrencies offline and online.\n\nAs for Ledger, Schwartz believes its CEO is trying to get customers to use its new service, claiming that it will not share any personal customer data with the IRS. The Ripple CTO strongly disagrees here.\n\nPaper wallets, hardware wallet and encrypted hot wallets\n\nA Twitter user asked Schwartz about the methods of storing crypto offline that he prefers. The Ripple CTO wrote in response that he cannot reveal his \"personal practices for obvious reasons.\" However, he shared his view on other wallets. Schwartz said that paper crypto wallets, hardware wallets and encrypted software wallets all possess their advantages and drawbacks.\n\nHowever, he says that he usually recommends SecuX wallets to those who just want to passively hodl their crypto without exchanging, staking or using it in other ways, such as making payments.\n\nI won't talk about my personal practices for obvious reasons. But paper wallets, hardware wallets, and encrypted software wallets each have their advantages and disadvantages. I've recommended SecuX wallets to people who just want to store crypto and not use, exchange, or stake. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) May 23, 2023\n\nSchwartz believes Ledger can leak users' data to IRS\n\nIn the root tweet, David Schwartz retweeted a video extract from a recent interview with Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier. The chief executive of the popular crypto hardware wallet commented on the recent update made by the company; from now on, there is an option for users to \"secure\" their seed phrase by encrypting it and sending it to three different devices in fragments.\n\nThe crypto space was shocked since this implies that crypto assets in supposedly cold wallets would now become easy targets for hackers, and Ledger would not bear any responsibility should anything happen, and these devices where the seed phrase fragments are sent become compromised.\n\nPascal Gauthier tried to calm the audience down by saying that this is not mandatory and that users can continue using Ledger wallet without switching this update on. But this was not what caught the David Schwartz's attention.\n\nGauthier claimed that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would not initiate any subpoena against Ledger, and even if it does, the IRS will not be interested in the personal data of Ledger customers.\n\nSchwartz strongly disagreed with that point, calling Gauthier's claim that there is nothing of interest for the IRS in users' personal data \"comically ridiculous.\"\n\nHe stressed that Ledger would start making a lot more money if its customers accept the new service, and he referred to the wallet producer as being \"so greedy to make money on this service that they completely forgot the entire value proposition of their product after all the effort they spent explaining it to people.\""

        "content": "After much anticipation, Ripple\u2019s 2023 New Value Report: Crypto Trends in Business and Beyond has dropped! Hot off the press, the latest edition of this annual thought leadership report is an important indicator of global sentiment and perspectives towards crypto, digital assets and blockchain, and provides a glimpse into the potential future of this technology in the months and years ahead.\n\nNow in its second year, the report continues to track awareness, interest and activity in crypto and blockchain solutions driving real business value. It also explores the pain points these technologies address and how crypto is evolving to form holistic, interoperable and lasting business solutions.\n\nDivided into three primary sections\u2014Tokenize, Manage and Move\u2014this year\u2019s report surveyed over 1,700 global finance leaders across financial institutions and enterprises regarding institutional decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), payments and more.\n\nTop Five 2023 Crypto Trends in Business\n\n1. Crypto outlook remains overwhelmingly positive.\n\nDespite a challenging 2022 for the crypto industry and a somewhat rocky start to 2023, this year\u2019s report finds overwhelming enthusiasm around the prospects for crypto and digital assets. Global finance leaders\u2019 confidence in crypto has actually increased over the last six months, with more than 90% saying the technology will have a significant or massive impact on business, finance and society within the next three years.\n\nRather than allowing a few bad actors to shake their long-term confidence in crypto, the sentiments of global financial leaders portray an industry leaning into the technology to help realize and fulfill crypto\u2019s full potential.\n\n2. High expectations are translating into real-world deployments.\n\nSeventy-nine percent (79%) of all respondents are either very or extremely confident about integrating cryptocurrency solutions into their businesses. The words most used to describe how they feel about crypto include \u201cexcited,\u201d \u201cconfident\u201d and \u201coptimistic.\u201d\n\nMore than three-quarters of respondents are open to exploring crypto and digital asset technologies like NFTs or stablecoins over the next few years. While most leaders have confidence in crypto, those who have experience using or implementing a crypto solution are the most optimistic, which further cements crypto\u2019s ability to drive real business value, now and in the future.\n\n3. Anticipation for tokenized real-world assets continues to grow.\n\nAccording to Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the tokenization of global illiquid assets could be a $16 trillion business opportunity by 2030. This potential is reflected by the 72% of respondents that expect to use tokenization in their business as a way of driving innovation over the next three years, and across a range of industries including finance, manufacturing, media and entertainment.\n\nCompared to last year, participants expect greater impact from CBDCs and stablecoins in less time, with cross-border and consumer-to-business payments being the two most highly ranked use cases for these token types. Finance leaders are particularly optimistic about the impact of tokenization on securitized assets like mortgages and asset-backed securities, and enterprises see the most potential in the metaverse and for events or ticketing.\n\n4. Payments is the top use case for holding crypto.\n\nCrypto-enabled payments is one of the technology\u2019s most mature use cases, with 44% of global finance leaders seeing payments as the most likely gateway to crypto adoption. Enterprises and financial institutions give nearly equal weight to the role of crypto for accepting payments (53%), enabling customers to make crypto payments (52%) and making cross-border payments in crypto (47%).\n\nMore than half of global payments leaders see faster payments as the top value proposition for integrating crypto into cross-border payments, while 50% of global treasury leaders say cost savings is a more pressing benefit.\n\n5. DeFi is coming to an institution near you.\n\nDespite being fairly nascent, this year\u2019s findings make it clear that finance leaders are keeping a close eye on institutional DeFi and many have already begun to explore or integrate DeFi solutions within their organizations. Seventy-six percent (76%) say they are interested in institutional DeFi as a means to drive innovation for their business in areas like the management of risk, liquidity and identity.\n\nFinance leaders are most excited about DeFi\u2019s potential to improve operational efficiency, data management, financial flexibility and access to always-on markets.\n\nAccelerating the Internet of Value\n\nWhile interest in crypto and digital assets is high and adoption trends are positive, challenges still lie ahead and the path to widespread use and integration isn\u2019t necessarily linear. For crypto-enabled solutions to become the standard across industries, reported concerns around privacy, regulatory clarity, risk management and price volatility must be addressed.\n\nBut as evidenced in this year\u2019s study, crypto adoption is being driven by growing consumer demand, tangible use cases for businesses and financial institutions, and an industry-wide shift towards real-world utility. It\u2019s no longer a matter of if, but when, for financial institutions and enterprises to benefit from crypto\u2019s speed, transparency and cost savings.\n\nHelping to educate financial institutions, governments and businesses on the potential and importance of crypto is critical to accelerating the Internet of Value.\n\nDownload the full report to learn more and get started today."
