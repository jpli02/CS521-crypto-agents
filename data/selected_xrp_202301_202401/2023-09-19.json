        "content": "A member of the security forces stands guard outside the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi. (Adnan Abidi/Reuters)\n\nOn Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged in a speech to Parliament that agents of the Indian government killed a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil. Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader, was killed in June in British Columbia..\n\n\n\n\n\nTrudeau\u2019s announcement led to the Canadian government expelling an Indian diplomat. India denied the allegations and expelled a Canadian diplomat in return. Canada has called upon its allies to publicly condemn the killing, just as countries including the United States are hoping to bolster their relationship with India in hopes of fending off China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Post\u2019s South Asia correspondent Karishma Mehrotra walks us through how we got to this geopolitical crisis and what it means for India\u2019s global relationships."

        "content": "Friends and others in the community said covering the mural erases history.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 A mural dedicated to a local DJ in Broad Ripple is no more, and it has people in the community upset.\n\nA wall once covered in vibrant colors remembering DJ and photojournalist Mpozi Mshale Tolbert is now bare. His friends and others in the community said a piece of history has been erased.\n\nTolbert died from natural causes in 2006 at the age of 34. The mural showed him DJing, angel wings on his back and his name sprawled across the brick. Now, all that remains is white paint and a bouquet of flowers. It was something Ife Mawusi-Bey didn't expect to see when she visited the mural for the first time Tuesday.\n\n\"It really makes me feel somber, a little sad because Mpozi was a really great guy,\" Mawusi-Bey said. \"He had a really big heart, and he touched a lot of people, and I feel like the mural was an honor for him, so for it to be painted over, it's just really sad.\"\n\nThe mural could be seen on the side of a Broad Ripple business for three years.\n\n\"It's empty,\" Jeff Miner said. \"It don't have any life anymore, the wall doesn't have any life.\"\n\nJeff is the brother of Ron Miner, otherwise known as DJ Indiana Jones. Ron and other friends of Mpozi helped bring the mural to life in 2020, 14 years after Mpozi died.\n\n\"I mean, you can look online and look at his photography. He was a first responder on Montserrat when the volcano erupted. He took some incredible pictures of that. He took pictures of 9/11. He was all over the place with his camera, on his bike. He was just a high-energy, high-vibrating being while on the planet,\" Miner said."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn an effort to streamline its services and enhance accessibility, Ripple has rebranded its \u201cODL\u201d (On-Demand Liquidity) section on its official website to \u201cRipple Payments.\u201d\n\nThis move comes as the company seeks to make its cross-border payment solution more user-friendly while maintaining its core functionalities.\n\nIntroduced in 2018, Ripple\u2019s ODL has long been recognized as a pivotal offering, providing instantaneous and cost-effective solutions for cross-border transactions, especially favoured by financial institutions. Leveraging XRP as a bridge currency, ODL has played a critical role in simplifying the complexities of international money transfers.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent removal of the ODL section from Ripple\u2019s website raised eyebrows among market participants and investors, with users questioning the motive behind this change.\n\nEmi Yoshikawa, Ripple\u2019s VP for Strategy and Operations, promptly responded to these concerns, shedding light on the situation. Contrary to the belief that ODL was eliminated, Yoshikawa clarified that it had been rebranded as \u201cRipple Payments.\u201d She further noted that the primary objective of this rebranding is to make it more understandable to individuals less familiar with cryptocurrency jargon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cODL is a word that is difficult to understand at first glance for outsiders, so we have decided to consolidate it into the term Ripple payments\u2026This is a trend in the transition from Crypto-like jargon to more mainstream.\u201d Emi said in a September 15 post on X.\n\nNotably, despite the rebrand, Ripple Payments will continue to function exactly as ODL did, she clarified. Emi said the rebrand was about simplifying and facilitating mainstream adoption without altering the fundamental services provided.\n\nThat said, amidst these changes, Ripple\u2019s ODL partnership network has continued to flourish, with a presence in over 55 countries worldwide today. Renowned financial institutions like SBI, Moneygram and Pyypl have embraced Ripple\u2019s payment services with open arms.\n\nOne notable success story in this expansive network is the impressive surge in ODL usage reported by Tranglo, one of Ripple\u2019s largest partners in the Asia-Pacific region. According to a Monday report, Tranglo witnessed a staggering 1,700% increase in ODL usage, surpassing all expectations in 2022. The transaction volume on ODL soared from $53 million in 2021 to an astounding $970 million in 2022, and it has further ballooned to a remarkable $2 billion in the first half of 2023.\n\nTranglo\u2019s achievement reflects the remarkable growth and resilience of Ripple\u2019s partnership ecosystem, especially in the face of regulatory challenges and market uncertainties. The growth of Ripple\u2019s payment solution can be attributed to its enhanced scalability, cost-effectiveness, and unmatched speed.\n\nThat said, the rebranding initiative underscores the company\u2019s commitment to making its services accessible to everyone without altering the core functionalities that have made Ripple a pivotal player in cross-border transactions. While the name has changed, the commitment to innovation and user-friendly solutions remains unwavering in Ripple\u2019s journey towards transforming global finance."

        "content": "CINCINNATI \u2014 Cincinnati is one of the country's hottest housing markets, but the ripple effects of a months-old cyber attack could ruin both buyers' and sellers' shot at a good deal.\n\nRoughly 8,000 members of the Realtor Alliance of Greater Cincinnati will cast a vote deciding whether the group will return to using the Rapattoni Multiple Listing Service more than a month after the California-based company was knocked offline by a cyber attack crippling home listing for sellers and buyers in Cincinnati.\n\nThe vote was forced by a petition of 1,000 members who complained the replacement service, Perchwell, has been riddled with bugs and inaccurate data for houses on the market.\n\nIn a statement on behalf of the Realtor-members of Greater Cincinnati Brett Keppler said, \"After weeks of attempting to utilize the Perchwell system, which has been approved and endorsed by our local Board of Directors, we have found that our data has lost its integrity and cannot be trusted when pricing a home and when searching for homes on behalf of our clients.\"\n\nRELATED | Real estate information system crashes amid red-hot market\n\nKeppler said the Perchwell system often failed to accurately convey information to popular listing websites like Realtor.com and Zillow.com.\n\n\"For the sake of both our livelihoods and for those families transacting real estate, a significant number of Realtor-members of the Greater Cincinnati Realtor Alliance have banded together to demand we return to Rapattoni, the reputable system which is back up and running and had previously supported our local market for the past 20 years,\" the statement read.\n\nReal estate agent Casey Stewart said she had full confidence the board would lead local real estate agents to the best system for serving home sellers and buyers in the region, but said the transition to Perchwell hasn't been without difficulty.\n\n\"It's definitely been like being between a rock and another rock you know less about,\" Stewart said\n\nIn a statement, MLS of Greater Cincinnati President Anne Uchtman said they could never have anticipated a cyber attack leaving the region without any listing services.\n\n\"The Multiple Listing Service of Greater Cincinnati and its board of directors are committed to finding a solution that allows our users to do their job to the best of their ability and continue serving our consumers,\" she said. \"Our two MLS providers, Rapattoni and Perchwell, have been extremely helpful and supportive during this crisis. We are working non-stop to get this issue resolved and hope to have a solution in the coming days.\n\nBoard member Joe Duffy with Comey & Shepherd Realtors said the board had been working to bring Perchwell online since 2022, well before the cyber attack on Rapattoni, and they accelerated the process when it was clear Rapattoni's system wouldn't be online quickly.\n\n\"We never knew when Rappatoni was going to come back,\" Duffy said. \"It was a ransomware attack, so we looked into rolling out Perchwell before it was fully developed.\"\n\nHe said Perchwell has agreed to a long schedule of rolling out bug fixes and new features as they become available.\n\nDuffy said Perchwell has been the least disruptive option available for Realtors, home buyers, and home sellers as they recover from the MLS outage.\n\n\"The petition is a result of fear, I feel like,\" he said.\n\nA vote of all Realtor-members on the future of Perchwell and Rapattoni in Cincinnati will begin electronically Sunday, Sept. 24, at noon and conclude on Tuesday, Sept. 26 at noon.\n\nIn the memo shared with WCPO, Realtor Association CEO Carl Horst wrote \"Rest assured; the outcome of the subscriber vote will determine the course of action for CincyMLS.\"\n\nA Rapattoni representative declined to comment and directed attention to their \"great customer of 20+ years, the REALTOR\u00ae Alliance of Greater Cincinnati.\"\n\nWCPO attempted to reach Perchwell for comment through their website but didn't receive a response."
