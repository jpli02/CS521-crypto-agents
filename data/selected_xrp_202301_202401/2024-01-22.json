        "content": "TL;DR\n\nGemini\u2019s recent tweets about XRP led to widespread speculation among the cryptocurrency community.\n\nA cryptic riddle posted by the firm intensified the hypothesis, with many anticipating an XRP-related announcement.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange Gemini sparked a speculative frenzy after posting a series of tweets related to Ripple\u2019s XRP.\n\nThe posts included phrases like \u201cDon\u2019t forget about xrp,\u201d \u201cxcited about xrp,\u201d and xrriving shortly,\u201d allowing the community to guess what move might be on the horizon.\n\nSome assumed that Gemini might introduce new services involving the cryptocurrency, while others suggested that the interaction on X could be a precursor for a spot XRP ETF filed with a European partner.\n\nRecall that the exchange recently received approval to operate as a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) in France. It also serves as a custodian for VanEck\u2019s newly launched spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe XRP army (a term indicating the group of supporters and investors of the coin) also noted that Gemini released similar cryptic posts in August last year \u2013 a month after Ripple secured its first partial court victory against the US SEC.\n\nShortly after, the exchange allowed customers to deposit XRP tokens on the platform. Other trading venues that re-listed the asset at that time were Kraken, Coinbase, Crypto.com, Bitstamp, and more.\n\nEarlier today (January 22), Gemini posted a riddle on X, depicting something that is \u201cswift and small\u201d in \u201cthe land of giants.\u201d\n\nCan you solve this riddle? In the land of giants, I\u2019m swift and small, when I run I don\u2019t stall. Across borders, I freely roam, in markets near and far from home. What am I? The answer will be posted in 24 hours. \u2014 Gemini (@Gemini) January 22, 2024\n\nMost guesses once again pointed out to XRP, with Gemini promising to reveal the answer within 24 hours."

        "content": "The recent market movements have subjected Ripple\u2019s price to increased selling pressure, precipitating a descent below the significant 100-day and 200-day moving averages and concluding a pullback.\n\nDespite this, indications point toward a sustained downward trajectory in the mid-term.\n\nXRP Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nRipple Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nA thorough examination of the daily chart unveils a notable decline in Ripple\u2019s price, breaching its multi-month sideways consolidation range and successfully completing a pullback. Intensified selling pressure also led to the breaking of a substantial support zone, encompassing the 100 and 200-day moving averages, prompting concerns about Ripple\u2019s mid-term direction.\n\nConsidering the prevailing price action and market conditions, the likelihood of the recent descent persisting is high, with the aim of breaching the significant multi-month support region at $0.48. A successful break below this critical range could potentially set Ripple on a prolonged downward trajectory, instigating fear and uncertainty in the market.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer analysis of the 4-hour chart reveals an impulsive breach below the lower boundary of the multi-week sideways wedge, underscoring the dominance of sellers in the market. However, the price has reached a pivotal support region determined by the multi-month ascending trendline.\n\nThis trendline has proven to be a robust support, halting multiple downward attempts. Presently, as the price intersects this crucial trendline and the static support zone at $0.52, there is a notable potential for a reversal, leading to a sideways consolidation phase.\n\nNonetheless, given the prevailing strength of sellers in the current market conditions, the possibility of a break below this crucial support region persists, potentially prolonging the ongoing downward trend. In such a scenario, the next critical support level for the price would be at $0.48."

        "title": "Prominent crypto lawyer criticizes SEC overreach in Ripple lawsuit, advocates for financial freedom - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "John Deaton, a well-known crypto lawyer, said that regulatory actions against the crypto industry point to a significant government overreach and intrusion into the private sector.\n\nDeaton made the statement on social media on Jan. 22, where he specifically called out the actions of various federal agencies, including the SEC, FBI, EPA, and the Federal Reserve \u2014 likening their operations to an Orwellian \u2018Big Brother\u2019 scenario.\n\nHis comments reflect a growing sentiment within the cryptocurrency community about the balance between regulation and financial liberty.\n\nRipple lawsuit\n\nDeaton\u2019s criticism was particularly pointed towards the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc., CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Chris Larsen. Initiated in December 2020, the lawsuit accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP.\n\nHe criticized the SEC\u2019s broad classification of XRP tokens as illegal securities, suggesting it was an unconstitutional expansion of the watchdog\u2019s authority. Deaton added that the dismissal of charges against Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen demonstrates the regulator\u2019s misuse of its power.\n\nDeaton also pointed out that before the lawsuit, major players like Coinbase and MoneyGram had conducted due diligence on XRP without any objections from the SEC, which indicates a lack of clarity and consistency in the regulator\u2019s approach toward cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe recent developments in the case bolster his argument. Judge Analisa Torres partially ruled in favor of Ripple Labs, determining that XRP sales on digital asset exchanges do not constitute a security.\n\nDeaton has suggested that the lawsuit was used as a weapon against Ripple, a stance he has maintained since filing a Writ of Mandamus against the SEC shortly after the lawsuit was announced.\n\nAttack on financial freedom\n\nDeaton, who has initiated legal action against the SEC on behalf of XRP investors, users, and developers, explained that his lawsuit was motivated by the broader implications of the SEC\u2019s actions rather than personal financial interest.\n\nHe stated that his holdings in XRP are minimal compared to other investments like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For Deaton and 75,000 others, the lawsuit represents an assault on a crucial liberty: financial freedom. He argued that in America, people should have the autonomy to own legal assets beneficial to their lives without government interference.\n\nThe attorney also criticized the Accredited Investor Rule, viewing it as a tool for the elite to restrict financial mobility for the majority of the population. He said the rule is a mechanism to maintain dependency on the government and restrict access to financial opportunities.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "BlackRock has decided to steer clear of an XRP ETF according to a Fox Business reporter.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple rages on, despite Judge Torres\u2019 ruling, XRP remains in a regulatory \u201cgray\u201d area.\n\nXRP price bleeds nearly 4% on the day, declines to $0.5291.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple continues in 2024. As the payment remittance firm is embroiled in the legal battle, a Fox Business reporter has commented on whether the asset management giant will support the XRP ETF.\n\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF, XRP holders are awaiting the launch of an XRP ETF.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin price is above $41,000 as BTC whales make strategic moves\n\nAsset management giant not likely to support XRP ETF\n\nBlackRock, one of the largest asset managers, is unlikely to support an XRP ETF according to Fox Business Reporter Charles Gasparino. The report is relevant since the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit rages on in 2024.\n\nAccording to the latest development in the lawsuit, the payment remittance firm has filed its response to the regulator\u2019s motion to compel, as on January 20. The case continues to garner interest in the XRP holder community.\n\nSCOOP: @BlackRock has no plans for a spot $XRP ETF, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter story developing \u2014 Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) January 18, 2024\n\nDespite Judge Torres\u2019 ruling on XRP sale on exchange platforms, stating that the asset is not an \u201cinvestment contract,\u201d the altcoin is a regulatory gray area. It is likely that BlackRock steered clear of XRP ETFs since there is not adequate clarity on XRP\u2019s status as a security or non-security.\n\nThe lawsuit\u2019s final outcome is expected to shed light on XRP\u2019s status.\n\nSEC v. Ripple lawsuit: What\u2019s next\n\nRipple\u2019s attorneys have opposed the SEC\u2019s motion to compel. This is a motion that requires the defendant to share information and facts about the case. The SEC requested the court to order Ripple to share 2022-2023 financial statements and post-complaint contracts governing XRP institutional sales on January 11. Post-complaint refers to the period of time after the SEC first filed its charges.\n\nThe regulator expects Ripple to respond to questions relating to post-complaint XRP institutional sales proceeds. Ripple is arguing, however, that the regulator had adequate time to request post-complaint documents in the fact discovery phase of the lawsuit. This ended on August 31, 2021. Thereafter, the SEC did not question the post-complaint conduct of the payment firm and it remained irrelevant to the lawsuit.\n\nRipple argues that the SEC should not be permitted to reverse course and the post-complaint conduct is irrelevant to the case. The SEC is likely looking for evidence to note whether Ripple continued non-compliance with securities laws after the charges were filed against the payment remittance firm.\n\nIf the SEC finds this to be true, the Judge presiding the case could inflict a penalty on Ripple.\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP price is $0.5291, with the altcoin continuing its decline this week."
