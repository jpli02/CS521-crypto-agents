        "title": "Market Rebounds But Ripple (XRP) Fails To Rise Whilst ApeCoin (APE) And Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Gain - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "The hardships of Ripple (XRP) still look intense as the project has failed to move into the green zone. However, ApeCoin (APE) and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) have registered significant growth.\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a new player in the crypto world, but it is set to grow massively during its presale round, which has already completed its four stages with a growth rate of 1400%.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nRipple (XRP) Loses Battle To Bearish Sentiments\n\nA recent report has revealed that Ripple\u2019s (XRP) case with SEC might take some more time to come to a conclusion. This has made investors apprehensive about their future with Ripple (XRP). Besides, the collapse of FTX Token has also hurt the growth prospects of Ripple (XRP). With these negative sentiments surrounding it, Ripple (XRP) has witnessed a fall in its price. The price of Ripple (XRP) has declined by more than 12% in the last month. As a result, the current trading price of Ripple (XRP) has tumbled to $0.4003, which is 10.42% below its all-time high of $3.84.\n\nRipple (XRP) is a blockchain-powered digital payment network and protocol. The primary goal of Ripple (XRP) is to establish a payment settlement asset exchange and remittance system. Ripple (XRP) has partnered with many multinational financial institutions.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nApeCoin (APE) Posts Positive Performance\n\nGaining a lot due to the buzz surrounding Web3 and NFTs, ApeCoin (APE) has witnessed a significant increase in its value. The price of ApeCoin (APE) has increased by 15% in the last seven days. Besides, ApeCoin\u2019s (APE) price has inclined by 8% in the last month. Currently, ApeCoin (APE) is being traded at $5.97, which is 21.7% below its all-time high of $27.51.\n\nApeCoin (APE) runs an ecosystem that includes the Bored Ape Yacht Club and all other Yuga Labs items and services. The popularity of ApeCoin (APE) increased shortly after its release in March 2022 because of its association with the highly-successful BAYC project. ApeCoin (APE) emerged as a tool for individual investors to get in on the BAYC project without spending fortunes for BAYC NFTs.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) Rides Faster On A Growth Unicorn\n\nThe fifth stage of Orbeon Protocol\u2019s (ORBN) presale phase has started. At present, one ORBN token is available to purchase at $0.06, which was just $0.004 at the beginning of the first stage of the presale round. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is an investment platform revolutionizing the crowdfunding and venture capital industry. The platform was launched to help budding startups raise capital using blockchain. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) mints fractional NFTs against stocks issued by companies, and people can become investors by purchasing them for as low as $1.\n\nThrough Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), businesses looking for funds can use the platform\u2019s NFTs-as-service (NFTaas) to raise the required amount by issuing equity-based NFTs. Additionally, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has developed the \u201cFill or Kill\u201d mechanism to protect investors from suffering losses. Orbeon Protocol\u2019s (ORBN) \u201cFill or Kill\u201d mechanism guarantees that all investors get their money back if the investment process falls apart abruptly. Moreover, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) promises to list only real-world and properly scrutinized businesses on the platform.\n\nAll four elements of the Orbeon ecosystem - Orbeon Swap, Orbeon Wallet, Orbeon Exchange and Metaverse - are run by ORBN tokens. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) holders will also receive added benefits, such as discounts on trading fees, voting rights, and cashback offers. Orbeon Protocol\u2019s (ORBN) growth during the initial four stages of the presale phase was more than 1400%, and it is expected to explode by 6000% before the launch.\n\nFind Out More About The Orbeon Protocol Presale\n\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\n\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/OrbeonProtocol"
