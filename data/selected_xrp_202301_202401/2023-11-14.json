We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nDespite the obvious advances made in the ongoing legal brawl between American blockchain payments firm Ripple Labs Inc. and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), negotiations over settlement are taking a new turn. According to a recent update by Judge Analisa Torres, the key dates for the parties to complete their remedy discovery have been set.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the letter from Judge Torres, created based on the parties' prior letter detailing their availability, Feb. 12, 2024, was set as the date by which both must have completed their remedies-related discovery. The SEC will have until March 13 next year to file its brief to the remedies it seeks, and Ripple Labs will file its opposition, should there be any by April 12, 2024.\n\nBefore Judge Torres will rule on any remedy based on these events, the SEC will have one last chance to file its reply to Ripple's opposition, and this has to be done by April 24, 2024.\n\nAs circulating on social media, the regulator is seeking about $770 million in damages from Ripple Labs over the part of the ruling it was guilty of. This part involves its role in selling XRP to institutional investors, a move Judge Torres ruled on July 13 violates federal securities laws.\n\nProjections for settlement\n\nAs predicted by top crypto lawyers before now, the ongoing settlement will be a tough negotiation journey for both Ripple Labs and the SEC.\n\nOne major consensus by all analysts is that Ripple will have to settle with the SEC; however, XRP holders' lawyer John Deaton has often reiterated that the amount Ripple will pay will be far less than the bogus sum the market regulator is asking for.\n\nDeaton considers a settlement fee of $20 million and below a great deal that marks a 99.9% victory for the payments company. This low sum will complement prior victories snatched by Ripple regarding labeling XRP a nonsecurity in and of itself and the dismissal of charges against the company's executives."

        "content": "XRP price tumbles as deadlines for the formal pretrial information exchange are set by Judge Torres.\n\nAttorney Fred Rispoli says Judge Torres\u2019 ruling on XRP is ironclad till mid-2026.\n\nThe altcoin\u2019s price witnessed a rapid pump and sell-off following unconfirmed news of XRP ETF filing by BlackRock.\n\nJudge Analisa Torres issued her ruling in the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit on July 13. Since the ruling however, both parties are still embroiled in a disagreement and attorneys expect a settlement between the two. Judge Analisa Torres has set new deadlines for the formal exchange of information pretrial, indicating a long-drawn conclusion to the lawsuit, likely in 2024.\n\nCrypto proponent attorneys believe that the payment giant is likely to settle with the US financial regulator, for a value much lower than the $770 million demanded by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlso read: XRP price slides 5% as experts revisit Judge Torres\u2019s judgment in the Ripple versus SEC case\n\nSEC v. Ripple lawsuit schedule for 2024\n\nJudge Analisa Torres, the presiding judge in the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit has set new deadlines for remedies discovery and briefing. Judge Torres reviewed the letter dated November 9 and set four key deadlines for the two parties:\n\nFebruary 12, 2024 for completion of remedies-related discovery (exchange of information, pretrial)\n\nMarch 13, 2024 for filing briefs with respect to remedies\n\nApril 12, 2024 for defendants (Ripple) to file their opposition\n\nApril 29, 2024 for the plaintiff (SEC) to file their reply\n\nIt is Attorney Fred Rispoli\u2019s opinion that with the above timeline, no appeal would be issued before mid-2026 by the 2nd Circuit. This cements Judge Torres\u2019 July 13 ruling, offering regulatory clarity on XRP tokens. Attorney Rispoli says, \u201cThe July 13, 2023 ruling by J. Torres will be ironclad for a very long time.\u201d\n\nThis timeline means no chance an appeal would be issued before mid-2026 by the 2nd Circuit. The July 13, 2023 ruling by J. Torres will be ironclad for a very long time. \u2014 Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) November 13, 2023\n\nRegulatory clarity has fueled demand for XRP among both retail and institutional traders.\n\nXRP price recently rallied to $0.7496, before a sell-off, in response to rumors of an XRP ETF filing by asset manager BlackRock.\n\nBlackRock XRP ETF rumors send altcoin soaring, before sell-off\n\nBlackRock, a large asset manager, scotched rumors it was launching a Ripple ETF by clarifying it is not attempting to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to a Coindesk report.\n\nA regulatory filing evidencing an XRP ETF filing by BlackRock, however, did the rounds on social media platforms like X, fueling a bullish sentiment among holders and sending the altcoin 10% higher, before its recent pullback.\n\nRumored XRP ETF filing by BlackRock\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP price is down nearly 8% on the week and 2% on the day. The altcoin erased its weekly gains once the rumors surrounding XRP ETF were addressed by the asset manager."

        "title": "XRP mooned and tanked because of a fake BlackRock filing\u2014but it's still up almost 30% over the last month - Fortune",
        "content": "One of the oldest cryptocurrencies and one of the largest by market cap, XRP may be considered less mainstream than, say, Bitcoin or even the altcoin Solana, but its dedicated fans, dubbed the XRP Army, fervently advocate for the token\u2014in both good times and bad.\n\nAnd on Monday, many of them suffered whiplash.\n\nA report by The Block of a BlackRock-backed XRP fund triggered a nearly 13% price spike before it was determined to be based on a falsified document. The fake filing, for a supposed \u201ciShares XRP Trust,\u201d was found on Delaware\u2019s state website for listing investment trusts that are incorporated by the state. But, as confirmed by Bloomberg, BlackRock didn\u2019t create the filing, and as of Tuesday it remained unclear how it was created and posted.\n\nAlmost immediately after the news was debunked, XRP shed those gains, and on Tuesday was trading at about 64 cents, down less than 3% over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in less than a month that a fake announcement, amplified by Crypto Twitter, fueled a massive rally: CoinTelegraph posted an announcement on X, formerly Twitter, claiming that the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s application to create a spot Bitcoin ETF. The news was quickly debunked, but it still pushed Bitcoin above the $30,000 mark.\n\nEach is reminiscent of an instance from 2021 when a fake press release claiming Walmart would begin accepting Litecoin shot the little-known crypto token up 33% before the company cleared things up.\n\nDespite Monday\u2019s false start, XRP is still up almost 30% over the last 30 days and more than 67% year over year, according to CoinGecko.\n\nRecent positive news for Ripple, the company associated with the token, has helped lift its price. Earlier this year, the firm notched a victory against the SEC after a judge ruled XRP was not a security in all instances. The SEC later dropped charges it had filed against two Ripple executives, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and executive chairman and cofounder Chris Larsen.\n\nAny further developments, such as an appeal by either Ripple or the SEC, are likely far away. Crypto-focused attorney Fred Rispoli said in a post on X that a ruling on an appeal would have \u201cno chance\u201d of being approved until 2026.\n\nStill, some investors are hopeful that a settlement between Ripple and the regulator could come sooner and push XRP\u2019s price up further. Others have speculated that the fake BlackRock filing was merely posted early and it could still materialize, although there is no evidence to support such a claim.\n\n\ud83d\udea8BREAKING: #RIPPLE CLO @s_alderoty CONFIRMS SETTLEMENT IS IMMINENT AND CAN TAKE PLACE ANY DAY. pic.twitter.com/uuThCmy3Tf \u2014 CryptoGeek (@CryptoGeekNews) November 14, 2023\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING: CNBC weighs in on the \"alleged\" #Blackrock #XRP ETF filing in Delaware. \ud83e\uddd0\n\n\n\nIs it really \"fake,\" or did someone jump the gun with a premature reveal? \ud83e\udd2b\ud83d\ude80#Ripple #BlackrockFiling #CryptoMystery \ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\udcc8 pic.twitter.com/WrurUL2urd \u2014 Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) November 14, 2023\n\nFor now, investors in XRP and other cryptocurrencies alike are closely watching the SEC\u2019s impending approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which Bloomberg analysts say has a 90% chance by early January."

Named one of the \"Top 5 Celebrity Lobbyists in D.C.\" by The Washingtonian, Drescher was instrumental in getting the Gynecologic Cancer Education Awareness Act passed by unanimous consent and was appointed Public Diplomacy Envoy by the U.S. State Department during the Bush and Obama Administrations.\n\n\"I am honored to be a recipient of the RFK Ripple of Hope Award,\" said Drescher. \"To be recognized for my efforts on behalf of workers pays tribute to my hard-working parents who taught me to respect and value America's labor force. The future of industry relies on redefining success to include respect, empathy, and spirituality in harmony with every decision made.\"\n\nPrevious Ripple of Hope laureates include Stacey Abrams, then-Vice President Joe Biden, Bono, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, George Clooney, Tim Cook, Dr. Anthony Fauci, poet Amanda Gorman, Dolores Huerta, Colin Kaepernick, late Congressman John Lewis, former President Barack Obama, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Robert F.

        "title": "Be better: A Broad Ripple review - The Butler Collegian",
        "content": "Looks pretty boring, right? Photo by Delaney Hudson.\n\nSARA CAINS | OPINION COLUMNIST | scains@butler.edu\n\nI\u2019m a person who likes to go out with friends once in a while instead of rotting in bed watching Netflix. Unfortunately, I live in Indiana where the opportunities for fun are sparse. I\u2019m a commuter at Butler, so I have more familiarity with local spots beyond campus. There\u2019s a town center mall near my house and while it\u2019s fun, I would rather not go to the same place every other weekend. Now that I\u2019ve started college, I have more freedom to venture outside of my hometown\u2019s entertainment \u2014 which has led me to one of the most talked-about areas, Broad Ripple.\n\nI\u2019ve heard so many amazing things about it, from the food to the scenery and the atmosphere. I was excited to see and experience all the cool shops and buzzing sidewalks.\n\nBut when I made it there, I was a little disappointed. My review of Broad Ripple \u2014 which please take lightly, because I am no college town connoisseur \u2014 is mostly negative.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what I was expecting. Of all the college towns I\u2019ve visited, I liked Bloomington the most. From how highly Broad Ripple is talked about, I thought it would be similar to Indiana University\u2019s atmosphere: bubbly, colorful and loud. But to me, Broad Ripple was sad and gloomy.\n\nFirst-year economics major Mindy Smith said her experience going to Broad Ripple did not live up to her expectations.\n\n\u201cComing into Butler I had heard a lot about Broad Ripple and how it was \u2018the place to be,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an exciting place to be. It feels kind of dangerous and weird.\u201d\n\nAs someone who listens to a lot of Crime Junkie, describing a place as dangerous and weird would make me run away from it as fast as I can.\n\nFirst-year music education major Mackenzie Maxwell also had a negative view of Broad Ripple.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a good place to get off campus for a little while, but it\u2019s mostly just a bunch of bars and construction,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cI wanted more scenery.\u201d\n\nConstruction can bog down any atmosphere. Butler students have been well acquainted with construction this year, and it can be an eyesore sometimes. Maxwell also compared Broad Ripple to on-campus activities.\n\n\u201cStaying on campus is way more fun than Broad Ripple,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cThere is always something to do on campus and activities available.\u201d\n\nWith fraternity and sorority philanthropy events, student performances and University Program Council events within walking distance, why would students want to go to Broad Ripple?\n\nFirst-year arts administration major Oli Barnett shared his in-depth review of Broad Ripple, and tips Butler could use to entertain their students better.\n\n\u201cI thought Broad Ripple would be a space that provided more opportunities where you don\u2019t have to pay or be a certain age to experience things,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cI think the school could be better at getting students to enjoy their community outside of campus by providing transportation to museums, parks, etc. I also think Broad Ripple could do a better job of including people who are under 21 but also adults.\u201d\n\nCollege towns should be inclusive to every age. College students are not just 21 and older. And believe it or not, some college students aren\u2019t interested in drinking every night for fun. Living on campus, especially with no reliable transportation, can feel isolating and boring in general. While there are musicals and club events on campus, it is nice to get out for a little while.\n\nCollege is about experiencing new things. Students should have a safe and stimulating environment to do that in. Broad Ripple has been around longer than Butler. It\u2019s not one of those towns that are only there because the university it\u2019s near is there, which is why I, and other students, expected more.\n\nWhile I know that one article by a college student won\u2019t change Broad Ripple, I do believe that Butler could provide more opportunities for students who don\u2019t have their own modes of transportation, or even advertise events going on around the downtown area so students don\u2019t feel like they are trapped in Butler\u2019s small corner of Indianapolis.\n\nHopefully in the future, Broad Ripple can begin to develop so students and residents of the small town see a range of activities they can partake in. They aren\u2019t doing all that construction for nothing, right?"
