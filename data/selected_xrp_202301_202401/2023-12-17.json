        "content": "Long-term XRP investors have shown remarkable patience and resilience as the SEC lawsuit winds down. After a string of victories against most of the SEC\u2019s charges this year, Ripple Labs is still battling the regulator over how much of a financial penalty it should have to pay.\n\nFmr. Goldman Head\u2019s Lifetime Opportunity: XRP\n\nReal Vision CEO Raoul Pal told CryptoLaw founder and Ripple amicus brief lawyer John Deaton in a recent interview that he bought XRP after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs in Dec. 2020. Pal called his XRP play an opportunity of a lifetime:\n\n\u201cWhen you see something like that, it\u2019s like, \u2018Okay, now the price has been massively discounted. We know it\u2019s a real thing, half the people have been shut out of the market, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.\u2019 So that\u2019s when I bought it. And I\u2019ve held it ever since.\u201d\n\nAfter predicting the U.S. mortgage crisis of 2008 \u2013 2009, Raoul Pal served as the co-head of European hedge fund sales in equities and equity derivatives at Goldman Sachs in London.\n\nRaoul Pal On XRP Price Moves Ahead\n\nPal believes in the long-term fundamental value of XRP tokens. During the interview with Deaton, he said he followed the same logic when he made an entry into Solana (SOL) tokens:\n\n\u201cThe crisis arrives. The price gets absolutely smashed, but I can see that there is a vibrant community with real use cases of the chain going on. It\u2019s not ghost use, it\u2019s real use, so in which case, time to put your capital at work.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that he has maintained since Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 ruling in July that Ripple tokens are not securities that XRP price wouldn\u2019t chart new highs until Bitcoin goes on its next multi-year bull run. His thesis is that the market price of altcoins like XRP and SOL will remain tied to the Bitcoin macrocycle.\n\nPal says by the time the macro-cycle\u2019s alt seasons kick in around 2025, \u201ceverything goes up ridiculously.\u201d Furthermore, in a recent post on X, Pal said the odds are higher than 20% that this \u201cis an Everything, Everywhere, All at Once adoption cycle.\u201d\n\nMany analysts are presently bullish on XRP in the short term as the price seems to be on the verge of printing a traditionally bullish pattern."

        "title": "Cyrusher Ripple: Are electric snowboards going to be a thing? - Electrek.co",
        "content": "As an electric bike/car enthusiast and snowboarder, I\u2019ve always wondered if an electric, cross-country snowboard would be possible. You know, when the mountain isn\u2019t available? Cyrusher\u2019s $3300 Ripple is one of the first attempts at building such a monster.\n\nBecause of my dual love for snowboarding and electric mobility, I got a Ripple ad in my Insta feed yesterday. Now I can\u2019t get the idea of an electric snowboard out of my mind.\n\nThe lone official Cyrusher Ripple Youtube video, uploaded 11 days ago, looks absolutely frightening with the spiked metal wheel in the back spinning a few inches away from the rider\u2019s hands and feet. The goofy riding user also seems to be riding on a mountain, which kind of obviates the need for a motorized board. Then he switches to what looks like the last day of snow on an east coast mountain with grass and rocks everywhere. He doesn\u2019t seem to be doing much carving either which doesn\u2019t seem like a ton of fun.\n\nThe Ripple is a 3kW motor attached to an electric clawed wheel in the rear of the board.\n\nThe quite large, squared battery lives in a backpack and is attached to the snowboard via a cable. Like electric skateboards, it is controlled with a handheld trigger.\n\nCyrusher says this thing has some pretty nutty specs:\n\n50km/h or 31mph top speed\n\n15-20km or 12 miles of range\n\n3kW of motor power\n\n12.6Ah Battery and assuming ~50V around 630Wh into a backpack with USB ports.\n\n156cm deck size\n\nWeight: 15kg (33 lbs)\n\nThere\u2019s a lone Youtube short of someone successfully testing out this thing:\n\nAs for competition in the electric snowboard, there\u2019s also a Russian tank track scooter that has been around for a few years but sadly hasn\u2019t been seen in western markets, as well as countless DIY projects.\n\nCyrusher announced a 44mph electric surfboard back in September and one has to wonder if these are just marketing tools to bring users to the site to buy Cyrusher\u2019s solid e-bikes.\n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nI\u2019d love to try the Ripple electric snowboard but I\u2019m not sure this would prove useful in too many situations. It could be useful to jump on a cross-country skiing trail or to go up a mountain that would be then snowboarded down \u2013 similar to riding an e-bike up a mountain and then taking it down like a downhill bike.\n\nI have to wonder however if the all-terrain scooters, like this one from Zondoo would be better in the snow if their wheels were replaced by the Ripple snowboard\u2019s rear metal spool.\n\nThat said, I\u2019d love to try this thing so if anyone at Cyrusher is reading this, get in touch!\n\nAnd of course, I\u2019m reminded of this:"
