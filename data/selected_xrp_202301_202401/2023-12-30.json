        "content": "Ripple (XRP) saw a holiday boost this week, rallying over 5% on Christmas Day as the crypto market sprang back to life. The XRP price hit a high of around $0.65, its highest level in over a month. However, on-chain data indicates strong network growth for XRP recently, fueling optimism about further upside.\n\nXRP is trading at $0.63 at press time, up close to 8% over the past 30 days. The sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has outperformed Bitcoin and the broader crypto market amid growing bullish sentiment.\n\nAlso read: VeChain New Year Price Prediction: How High Can VET Go?\n\nA key factor driving enthusiasm is the spike in new users on the XRP ledger network. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, a whopping 12,819 new XRP wallets were created on Monday alone.\n\nNew Ripple User Growth Key Catalyst\n\nThe last time XRP saw similar growth in new wallet addresses was in late December last year. At the time, XRP prices had rallied by over 15% in just three days following the heightened network activity.\n\nXRP\u2019s network growth metric tracks the number of new wallet addresses being created daily, seen as a proxy for how fast its ecosystem is attracting new users. More new users tend to boost XRP\u2019s market demand and trading volumes.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu: Who Owns The Highest Number of SHIB Coins?\n\nXRP prices have already bounced firmly off support around the $0.59\u20130.62 area thanks to the spike in retail interest. Its relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator, also shows ample room for further upside.\n\nFor prices to maintain the bullish trajectory, Ripple XRP bulls need to reclaim immediate resistance around $0.67. This could open the door for prices to challenge XRP\u2019s November highs near $0.80.\n\nHowever, failure to build on the recent gains could see XRP slip back towards the $0.59 support zone, according to analysts. Broader crypto market winds will likely dictate near-term price action."

Terra ruling, highlighting three major elements in the court\u2019s verdict.\n\nStuart Alderoty, Ripple\u2019s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to comment on the summary judgment decision issued in the SEC v. TerraForm Labs lawsuit.\n\nI have no firm view on the merits of the Terraform case, but here are a couple of thoughts on yesterday\u2019s ruling. 1. Facts matter. 2. Judge Rakoff does not criticize, let alone even cite, Judge Torres\u2019 Ripple ruling; 3. The SEC\u2019s \u201cforever\u201d crypto ground war, fighting token by\u2026 \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) December 29, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSEC v. Terra Ruling\n\nRecall that U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff issued the highly anticipated summary judgment on December 28, with the SEC securing a major victory. As reported earlier, the judge declared UST and LUNA as securities while rejecting the SEC\u2019s claim that Terra illegally offered security-based swaps.\n\nNotably, the SEC\u2019s fraudulent claims against Terra and its founder, Do Kwon, will be decided in a jury trial scheduled for January 2024.\n\nRipple CLO Reacts\n\nThe summary judgment decision in the Terra case has stirred reactions from top crypto stakeholders and legal experts. Interestingly, Ripple CLO is the latest legal expert to comment on the matter.\n\nThe Ripple CLO highlighted three important elements of the ruling in a tweet yesterday. Alderoty stated the importance of factual basis in cryptocurrency-related legal cases.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn Alderoty\u2019s analysis, he pointed out that Judge Rakoff did not criticize nor cite the ruling issued by his colleague Judge Analisa Torres in the Ripple case.\n\nThe omission of the Ripple verdict in Terra\u2019s summary judgment is noteworthy, given the similarities of both cases. For context, the SEC alleged that both Ripple and Terra offered unregistered securities. While the Ripple judge held that XRP in itself is not a security, Judge Rakoff ruled that UST and LUNA constitute securities.\n\nEarlier this year, Judge Rakoff disagreed with Judge Torres\u2019 reasoning in the Ripple case. According to Judge Rakoff, the Howey test, a longstanding security test in the U.S., does not distinguish between buyers the way Judge Torres did.\n\nA Fool\u2019s Errand\n\nFurthermore, Alderoty took a swipe at the SEC\u2019s approach to regulating crypto through litigation. He characterized the SEC\u2019s war on crypto as a fool\u2019s errand driven by a quest for political power rather than a foundation in sound policy.\n\nAlderoty\u2019s remark comes as the industry continues to grapple with regulatory uncertainties and protracted legal battles. Aside from Terra and Ripple, the SEC is also embroiled in legal tussles against top crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken.\n\nIn these lawsuits, the regulator labeled over 10 crypto assets as securities. With the SEC\u2019s latest victory against Terra, there is a tendency for the regulator to give the securities tag to more tokens."

        "content": "Braided channels of the Mississippi River near the Quad Cities are pictured Sept. 18. Flight support provided by LightHawk. Iowa is one of 33 states that fuel algae blooms that starve aquatic life of oxygen, causing billions in damage to fisheries and marine habitats every year in the Gulf of Mexico. (Nick Rohlman/The Gazette)\n\nThis explainer complements a two-part series, Ripple Effects, on the 10-year anniversary of the Nutrient Reduction Strategy. Read part one here, and part two here.\n\nA raindrop splashes onto Iowa soil and rolls downhill, picking up nitrogen and phosphorous that plants use to grow tall and develop roots, fruits and flowers. It plops into a waterway and eventually spills into the Mississippi River. America\u2019s second longest river carries it south and spits it into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThat\u2019s the journey water droplets in the Mississippi River basin follow \u2014 and that\u2019s the origin story of the Gulf of Mexico Hypoxic Zone, or dead zone. Nutrient pollution from 33 states fuels algae blooms that starve aquatic life of oxygen, causing up to $2.4 billion dollars in damage to fisheries and marine habitats every year.\n\nThat pollution creates problems where it originates, too, putting drinking waters supplies, ecosystems and recreation in danger.\n\nIn 2013, Iowa released its Nutrient Reduction Strategy to abide by Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency directives. The strategy aims for a 45 percent reduction in total nitrogen and phosphorus pollution based on average nutrient loads from 1980 to 1996. Iowa\u2019s state leadership chose not to adopt any timelines to reach that goal.\n\nThe two-pronged plan addresses nutrient pollution from point sources, like wastewater treatment plants and industrial facilities, and nonpoint sources, like runoff from croplands and urban areas.\n\nRegulating discharges from point sources\n\nPoint sources contribute about a third of Iowa\u2019s phosphorous pollution and about 10 percent of its nitrogen pollution.\n\nTo meet Task Force targets, Iowa point sources need to reduce 4 percent of their nitrogen contributions and 16 percent of their phosphorous contributions. To do this, the Nutrient Reduction Strategy directs the Iowa Department of Natural Resources to regulate nutrient discharges from point sources through permits.\n\nAeration tanks swirl with bacteria Nov. 16 that consume organic matter and release nitrogen gas at the Coralville Wastewater Treatment Plant. The plant underwent a $32 million upgrade to better monitor and mitigate nutrient discharges. (Nick Rohlman/The Gazette)\n\nNutrient removal is expensive, though, said Adam Schnieders, the Iowa DNR water quality resource coordinator. Establishing removal technologies at 130 facilities, plus operating and maintenance costs over 20 years, was estimated to cost $1.53 billion in present-day dollars \u2014 costs that would be passed to customers.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Nutrient Reduction Strategy aims for technology-based or performance-based reductions from point sources \u2014 or, the reductions point source facilities can reasonably achieve with their available technology and financial resources.\n\nThe strategy focuses on 161 of the state\u2019s biggest point source facilities: those designed to treat a million gallons of wastewater a day or more and could afford drastic upgrades. That includes 107 major municipal plants and 54 industrial facilities.\n\nThose facilities had to complete two-year feasibility studies to determine how they could best achieve nitrogen and phosphorous removal. For the first time, they were issued permits that required them to monitor the nutrient levels in their discharges, which would inform their progress toward the strategy\u2019s goals.\n\nBased on the results of those studies, the Iowa DNR will devise a timeline for facilities to complete their necessary upgrades. Those commitments will be incorporated into their permits. Once the upgrades are complete, and following a year of nitrogen and phosphorous monitoring, new discharge limits will be added to facilities\u2019 permits and become enforceable.\n\n\u201cEach one of these plants is so unique that the outcomes of these feasibility studies can vary significantly,\u201d Schnieders said. \u201cWe've been implementing the process for 10 years, and we're starting to figure out where all the facilities fall.\u201d\n\nVoluntary conservation for ag\n\nNonpoint sources make up about 90 percent of the nitrogen and about two-thirds of the phosphorus entering Iowa waterways.\n\nTo meet Task Force targets, Iowa needs to reduce at least 41 percent of its nitrogen pollution and 29 percent of its phosphorus pollution from nonpoint sources. It has chosen to do so through voluntary measures for agriculture.\n\nIowa began its efforts with a comprehensive science assessment that mapped the state\u2019s nutrient pollution. Scientists reviewed existing research to calculate a baseline for Iowa\u2019s nitrogen and phosphorous loads \u2014 the \u201cstarting line\u201d to improve from, said Jamie Benning, ISU\u2019s assistant director for agriculture and natural resources extension.\n\nThey investigated sources of nutrient loss, studied best practices for mitigating it and identified gaps that future research should target.\n\nThe scientists behind the science assessment then created a \u201cmenu\u201d of conservation practices available to help reduce the state\u2019s nitrogen and phosphorous pollution from nonpoint sources.\n\nThey devised scenarios with different combinations of conservation practices that would successfully achieve the nutrient reduction goals, along with their estimated costs. They considered factors like lowering fertilizer application rates, increasing cover crop acreage, shifting tillage methods and building more wetlands.\n\nThese scenarios served as examples \u2014 not regulations.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a prescription to say, \u2018This is the way,\u2019\u201d Benning said. \u201cIt helped illustrate what was possible and what we needed to do \u2014 the magnitude of what needed to happen to reach the goals.\u201d\n\nCity of Cedar Rapids water quality analyst Candice Kucera collects a water sample May 23 at Winnebago Park in Cedar Rapids.
