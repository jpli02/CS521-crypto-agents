        "title": "RICHARD JOHNSON: Meghan Markle's upcoming book expected to be more of a bombshell than Prince Harry's 'Spare' - New York Daily News",
        "content": "Meghan Markle thinks her book will sell better that Prince Harry\u2019s \u201cSpare.\u201d Publishing insiders say she has been keeping a secret journal since she met her husband and is using those diaries as the basis for the book she will release within two years.\n\nThe tome, expected to fetch upwards of $30 million, will disclose more details of how she feels mistreated by the Royal Family.\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrive at the 2022 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Ripple of Hope Award Gala at the Hilton Midtown in New York on Dec. 6, 2022.\n\nThe Duchess is not going to the coronation of King Charles on May 6 because, as palace courtiers whisper, she traded her absence in exchange for the official recognition of the titles of Prince and Princess for her two children.\n\nBut you can be sure Prince Harry will debrief her about every perceived snub.\n\nThe Duchess will come to New York City on May 16 to accept a Women of Vision Award from her friend Gloria Steinem\u2019s Ms. Foundation, which recognizes \u201cpowerhouse grassroots leaders.\u201d\n\nMarkle\u2019s presence has already ensured a sellout at the Ziegfeld Theater.\n\n*****\n\nHow many New Yorkers would knowingly move into a haunted apartment because it\u2019s cheap? I\u2019m betting plenty.\n\nWell, that\u2019s what happens to a couple in the new horror film by director Allan Piper entitled \u201ceVil Sublet.\u201d\n\nThey find their dream apartment in the East Village (aka the eVil) and they\u2019re, like, \u201cWho cares if it\u2019s cursed if the rent is cheap and its got an eat-in kitchen?\u201d\n\nBut when the bad roommate situation of living with murderous ghosts becomes too much for them, they must enlist the help of friends to escape the \u201ceVil\u201d in their sublet.\n\nSally Struthers arrives at the premiere of \u201cGilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\u201d on Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 in Los Angeles.\n\nEnter \u201cAll in the Family\u201d legend Sally Struthers, who stars in her first-ever full length horror movie as the mysterious leaseholder who rents out the haunted flat.\n\nStruthers told me she is easily frightened. \u201cOne thing happens to me unexplainable and I\u2019m out of there and living in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nThough she hasn\u2019t seen the finished film yet, Piper has promised to hold her hand when she does.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be part of the scaring than be scared,\u201d Struthers said. \u201cHorror films frighten me. And then they stay with me. They\u2019re like a side-of-the-road [car] accident.\u201d\n\nThe movie premieres at the Coney Island Film Festival on May 6, because scenes were shot at the 123-year-old Wonder Wheel and inside the Spook-A-Rama, one of the nation\u2019s oldest operating dark rides.\n\n\u201cOur movie has freaks, sword swallowers, a creepy ventriloquist doll, and a monstrous clown-like apparition,\u201d says Piper. \u201cWe could\u2019ve debuted the movie at larger festivals but since we filmed a big part of the movie here, it made the most sense.\u201d\n\nPiper, who lives in the haunted apartment where the movie filmed, said the neighborhood is so weird, \u201cWhen the zombie apocalypse happens in the East Village, we won\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nStruthers said, \u201cI\u2019m 5 feet tall and in my 70s. I kept telling myself, there is nothing to be afraid of.\u201d\n\nThe star and her director will be on the Anthony Cumia Show podcast on May 8.\n\n****\n\nDrake speaks onstage during Drake\u2019s Till Death Do Us Part rap battle on October 30, 2021 in Long Beach, California.\n\nDrake wasn\u2019t happy when his voice was generated by a computer using artificial intelligence to produce \u201cHeart on My Sleeve.\u201d\n\nHis record label, Universal Music Group, soon had the song deleted.\n\nSo now maybe Drake knows how Obrafour feels. Drake allegedly sampled a 20-year-old hit by the Ghanaian artist on \u201cCalling My Name\u201d without permission, and now Obrafour is suing for $10 million.\n\n\u201cDrake would not have done this to someone like LL Cool J,\u201d Obrafour stated. \u201cBut it appears that Drake didn\u2019t have this respect for an artist like myself from Africa.\u201d\n\nObrafour\u2019s lawyer Imran Ansari, of Aidala, Bertuna & Kamins, told me, \u201cHe hopes to send a message to mainstream international artists that you cannot simply take from an artist who may be lesser known, or in another country, without giving credit where credit is due.\u201d\n\n****\n\nSusan Silver, an original writer of \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d was eager to see \u201cBeing Mary Tyler Moore,\u201d which will air on HBO in May.\n\nShe had given a filmed interview for the documentary. But much to her surprise and disappointment, it turned out that all the interviews (including hers), were used only as voice-overs.\n\nNonetheless, Silver was excited the producers used the picture of her from a \u201cTV Guide\u201d article showing her in hot pants, since her memoir is called \u201cHot Pants in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nShe hastens to point out \u201cthat was my wardrobe, not my behavior\u201d \u2026 despite the subtitle, \u201cSex, Secrets & Sitcoms.\u201d\n\n****\n\nBrooke Shields attends the \u201cPretty Baby: Brooke Shields\u201d New York Premiere at Alice Tully Hall on March 29, 2023 in New York City.\n\nBrooke Shields\u2019 16-year-old daughter Grier will lead Audrey Gruss\u2019 Hope for Depression Research Foundation\u2019s Teen Race of Hope at Hudson River Park on May 21.\n\nNot only does Grier follow in her mother\u2019s footsteps as a teenage beauty, but her mother was also honored by the foundation, along with Anderson Cooper, Michael Phelps, and Aly Raisman in recent years.\n\nLast week, psychiatrist Dr. Samantha Boardman spoke about mental health and children at the foundation\u2019s event at Veronica Beard\u2019s store on Madison Ave.\n\n****\n\nKimberly and Steven Rockefeller Jr. gave a party for their 23-year-old daughter Kayla Rockefeller to launch her new jewelry collection Kayla Jaclyne at the new Mediterranean restaurant White Olive.\n\nAmong the socialites on the dance floor were Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia, Baroness Milly De Cabrol, Isabelle Bscher, Anne Dexter-Jones, Julia Haart, Libbie Mugrabi, Patrick McMullan, Liliana Cavendish, Christian Rockefeller and Steven Rockefeller III.\n\nKayla, whose great-grandfather was Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, will give a portion of all sales to Rising Ground NYC.\n\n****\n\nThe lunch crowd at Michael\u2019s on Wednesday included David Byrne of Talking Heads, hosted by Michael Huppe of SoundExchange, plus Blythe Danner with painter Kim McCarty, and former Time Warner chief Jeff Bewkes with Michael Solomon of Telepictures fame.\n\nOne COVID-weary regular said, \u201cThings seem to be picking up \u2026 finally!\u201d\n\n****\n\nRestaurant critic Mimi Sheraton, who died at 97, was remembered fondly at Frank E. Campbell funeral chapel on Madison Ave.\n\nNobu boss Drew Nieporent \u2014 who spoke with her in her last months, while she was dealing with food poisoning \u2014 said she made him a promise that her epitaph would be, \u201cIt must have been something I ate.\u201d"
