        "content": "Yoriko SUDO (Mariko TSUTSUI) is a woman in her 50s. She draws fine ripples in the sand every morning as she tends to the Zen garden in her yard, which seems incongruous with her modern house in its quiet residential area. Yoriko is devoted to a cult-like religion, the Ryokumei-kai or the Green Life Water Society, and spends her days in prayer and study. One day, her husband Osamu (Ken MITSUISHI), who abandoned her and their son several years ago, comes back. His return is like a rock that makes ripples on the quiet surface of her life. The earthquake, nursing care for the aged, new religions, discrimination against the handicapped \u2013 the unexplained darkness in the world appears in the Sudo family. When Yoriko's emotions which have been stifled are revealed, the film rises from despair to entertainment. (Source: Japanese Film Database)\n\nRipples is written and directed by Naoko OGIGAMI (Riverside Mukolitta). Theatrical release in Japan is scheduled for May 26, 2023."

        "title": "Ripple CTO David Schwartz Confirms 10 Things XRP Community Should Get Right - Times Tabloid",
        "content": "In a recent issue, Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz upheld some unpopular facts about Ripple and XRP shared by a community member.\n\nFollowing the many misconceptions about Ripple and the XRP Ledger native token, XRP, a community member named Sir Clown Sniper took to Twitter on Friday to share 10 truths about the sixth-largest cryptocurrency, its underlying technology XRP Ledger and Ripple.\n\nIt bears noting that XRP is the native token of the blockchain platform \u2014 XRP Ledger. While Ripple is a crypto solutions company and cross-border payment firm headquartered in San Francisco.\n\nAs listed by Sniper, below are ten things the XRP community needs to get right:\n\nXRP cannot be pegged to Gold, Silver, or anything else\n\nXRP cannot magically just become a stablecoin\n\nStablecoins issued on the XRP Ledger are not XRP\n\nThe XRP Ledger requires electricity to operate\n\nXRP can only exist on the XRP Ledger otherwise it is an IOU. For context, an IOU token is a type of digital asset that is used to represent debt between two parties. IOU stands for \u201cI owe you\u201d and is a contract that acknowledges a certain amount of debt owed.\n\nXRP has nothing to do with ISO 20022. Notably, ISO 20022 is the de facto global data standard for modern payments and Ripple became its first Distributed Ledger Technology-focused partner after joining in 2020.\n\nInter Ledger does not require XRP.\n\nAll the money in the world will not run across the XRP Ledger\n\nThe US Government is not going to buy back your XRP\n\nRippleNET is totally different from the XRP Ledger.\n\nSniper\u2019s second point about XRP becoming a stablecoin like USDT, BUSD, and USDC contradicts the points previously noted by XUMM wallet developer, Wietse Wind. As published, Wind started two theoretical scenarios where XRP could function as a stablecoin.\n\nLikewise, his ninth point also counters the popular buyback theories shared by Jimmy Vallee, the managing director of Valhil Capital.\n\nRecall that Schwartz called Vallee\u2019s first buyback theory an awful scam while he agreed to his subsequent theory about XRP being a good collateral like gold and sticks. Reacting to the ten points highlighted by Sniper, Ripple CTO said all points are true.\n\n<\n\nAll of these things are true. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 6, 2023\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"

        "title": "Legal community expects XRP verdict by May 6 as lawyer admits SEC has one valid claim - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Bill Morgan supports this claim of the SEC against Ripple\n\nPer Morgan, the regulator\u2019s claim acknowledges investors may be banking on Ripple\u2019s legal endeavors to reap gains rather than the company\u2019s business efforts.\n\nThis suggests that the outcome of Ripple\u2019s legal battle against the SEC holds substantial weight in terms of the value of XRP. As such, it highlights the crucial role that the lawsuit plays in shaping the future of cryptocurrency and its investors.\n\n\u201cParadoxically, the SEC may be correct about investors relying on Ripple\u2019s efforts but not because of Ripple\u2019s business efforts or sales of XRP, but its legal efforts defeating the SEC\u2019s lawsuit should it be successful,\u201d said Bill.\n\nMorgan\u2019s statement emphasizes that investors relying on Ripple\u2019s influence to bolster the value of XRP have little to do with the efforts that the judge in the historic Howey case had in mind.\n\nExpert\u2019s opinion regarding the legal battle\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple has prompted many supporters of the XRP token to comment on the third and fourth prongs of the Howey Test.\n\nThis legal framework determines whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract, and the SEC has invoked it to argue that XRP should be considered an unregistered security.\n\nAs the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC continues, pro-XRP lawyers like Bill Morgan, John Deaton, and Jeremy Hogan have raised doubts about the SEC\u2019s argument.\n\nSpecifically, these lawyers have questioned the agency\u2019s reliance on the Howey Test to argue that XRP is an investment contract.\n\nJohn Deaton has suggested that Judge Torres may view Ripple\u2019s action as an offering. Deaton expressed his skepticism about Ripple\u2019s counter-argument that there was no underlying contract to qualify the move as an investment contract.\n\nAccording to Deaton, this argument may pass in the Second Circuit and Supreme Court, but Judge Torres may not be persuaded by it.\n\nDeaton forecasts verdict date for Ripple vs. SEC legal battle\n\nAs the crypto community eagerly awaits the summary judgment in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, John Deaton also provided insight into the potential ruling date.\n\nDuring an interview with Thinking Crypto, Deaton, representing thousands of XRP holders in the lawsuit, predicts that Judge Torres will deliver her ruling on or before May 6.\n\nDeaton bases his prediction on Judge Torres\u2019 ruling timeline in past cases, noting that she typically delivers summary judgments within two months of deciding on Daubert motions. XRP holders and the wider crypto community will watch closely for Judge Torres\u2019 decision as the case progresses."

        "content": "Summary: How parents express and process their emotions can have an impact on their child\u2019s emotional and social development, researchers report.\n\nSource: The Conversation\n\nHow our families express feelings, talk about feelings and react to feelings can have ripple effects into the next generation.\n\nWhen someone becomes a parent, the models they had can become embedded in how they in turn parent.\n\nA parent\u2019s organized set of thoughts and feelings about their own and their child\u2019s feelings is what some psychologists call \u201cparental meta-emotion philosophy.\u201d Understanding this can make a big difference in parenting and children\u2019s development.\n\nI lead research projects that investigate the usefulness of programs that teach parents how to understand their \u201cfeelings about feelings\u201d and guide their children in healthy emotional regulation and coping strategies.\n\nThe family emotional climate\n\nAll of us have a long emotional history that comes from the emotional climate we grew up with. Early experiences become ingrained in how we feel about feelings, and affect our ability to form healthy relationships.\n\nBased on their emotional history, some parents become good at what psychologists call emotion coaching.\n\nThese parents have learned to recognize and accept their feelings, for example that \u201cit is okay to be sad.\u201d They are aware of their children\u2019s lower-intensity feelings and view their children\u2019s emotional displays as a time for connection and teaching.\n\nBecoming aware of feelings\n\nOther parents have learned to ignore or deny their feelings and develop a tendency to dismiss emotions. These parents tend to avoid uncomfortable feelings like sadness and anger. Emotionally dismissive parents will likely try to make uncomfortable feelings in children go away quickly or brush them off by saying things like \u201cyou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d\n\nGaining the ability to be aware of, understand and manage feelings is an important part of child development. Studies have shown that parents who have an \u201cemotion coaching\u201d philosophy support their children\u2019s emotional regulation, behaviour and social skills.\n\nThe question is, how effective is teaching parents to understand their \u201cfeelings about feelings\u201d at improving the family emotional climate and child development outcomes.\n\nParenting programs\n\nParent education programs teach parents about children\u2019s needs and development and offer them tools to enhance their parenting behaviours. Some parenting classes and programs are delivered through organizations like family centres and social services.\n\nOthers are offered through medical clinics like pediatricians\u2019 offices. There are many programs that help parents respond to children\u2019s challenging behaviours \u2014 for example, teaching parents how to positively reinforce children\u2019s appropriate behaviours.\n\nMore recently, some parenting programs have begun to focus on parents\u2019 feelings about feelings: emotion-focused parenting programs. These programs teach parents specific parenting behaviours that support their children\u2019s emotional needs.\n\nOne such program is called Tuning in to Kids. It was developed in Australia and teaches parents how to become \u201cemotion coaches\u201d who emotionally connect with their children, label and validate their children\u2019s feelings, and help their children solve problems.\n\nAnother example is the Emotional Development version of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, which strengthens relationships and teaches parents how to help their children regulate emotions.\n\nTailored parenting programs\n\nIn research with my colleagues, Krysta Andrews, Leslie Atkinson and Andrea Gonzalez, I have examined the effectiveness of emotion-focused programs in a recently published article in Clinical Psychology Review. This article provides strong evidence that emotion-focused parenting programs can enhance parents\u2019 ability to positively socialize their children\u2019s emotional development and maximize positive outcomes for families.\n\nHowever, there is a need for families, researchers, clinicians and early childhood development policymakers to work together to find out what programs work best, when and for whom.\n\nSome of my work suggests that these programs may especially benefit children and adolescents with complex needs, such as co-occurring mental health problems and neurodevelopmental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\nChildren under two, culturally appropriate programs\n\nSome of my research indicates that emotion-focused parenting programs should be adapted or developed for specific populations. For example, for parents of children under age two, as this age is a period of vulnerability for long-lasting emotional and behavioural problems.\n\nAll of us have long emotional histories that emerged from the emotional climate we grew up with. Image is in thee public domain\n\nAnd, the way families \u201cfeel about feelings\u201d is also influenced by social determinants of health, which include socioeconomic factors like culture, racialization, education, housing and income. This suggests that programs for parents of children of different ages should also be culturally appropriate. Emotion-focused programs should be adapted to serve a diversity of caregivers, family structures and backgrounds.\n\nEffects on biology\n\nParenting is a biological process \u2014 hormones, brain regions and chemical messengers in the brain all support parenting behaviours. Programs that focus on parental meta-emotion philosophy have the groundbreaking ability to change parenting on a behavioural level, but also on a biological level.\n\nPsychology researchers have reason to think that helping parents understand their \u201cfeelings about feelings\u201d can change children\u2019s biology. One study found that program content on emotion development was uniquely related to positive changes in emotion-related parenting and children\u2019s brain signals.\n\nIt is possible that these behavioural and biological changes can be passed on across generations.\n\nFamilies with parents who understand their \u201cfeelings about feelings\u201d will have a positive emotional change now and possibly into future generations.\n\nAbout this psychology research news\n\nAuthor: Gillian England-Mason\n\nSource: The Conversation\n\nContact: Gillian England-Mason \u2013 The Conversation\n\nImage: The image is in the public domain"

        "title": "5 Alternatives to XRP With a Bigger Growth Potential | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Although currently going through a gruesome lawsuit with regulators, Ripple still remains one of the largest utility tokens in the industry. The cryptocurrency is used in its global payment network with major banks to secure its payment settlement system.\n\nThrough its system, banks can access fast settlements with very low fees, which is why it\u2019s used by large financial institutions worldwide, such as Santander, Axis Bank, and Yes Bank.\n\nHowever, Ripple isn\u2019t the only cryptocurrency in the sector that provides real-world utility. Moreover, the fact that XRP has already grown into one of the largest cryptocurrencies means that its potential growth upward is limited relative to other budding projects.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a token that can provide tangible utility, here are five alternatives to XRP with bigger potential growth.\n\nA Quick Overview of the 5 Alternatives to XRP With a Bigger Potential Growth\n\nDeeLance \u2013 A Revolutionary and Transparent Freelancing Platform Chainlink \u2013 DeFi\u2019s Most Important Cryptocurrency Project Binance token \u2013 The Native Token Behind the World\u2019s Largest Exchange Chiliz \u2013 The Budding Fan Token Experience Basic Attention Token \u2013 The Token Revolutionizing Online Advertising\n\nA Closer Look at the 5 Alternatives to XRP With a Bigger Potential Growth\n\n1. DeeLance \u2013 A Revolutionary and Transparent Freelancing Platform\n\n\u200b\n\nDeeLance tops the list of the best alternatives to XRP with a bigger potential growth because it provides a solution to the freelancing problem millions of individuals face today. DeeLance is on a mission to revolutionize the freelance gig economy and keep freelancing open to everybody while providing a secure and transparent ecosystem for buyers and sellers.\n\nWith freelancing becoming the future of workplace dynamics, it\u2019s unsurprising to learn that the sector has grown tremendously, with the global gig economy expected to surpass $450 billion in 2023. More specifically, some estimates suggest that freelancing itself is expected to hit $12 billion by 2028.\n\nWith such a large industry, DeeLance aims to integrate the sector with the latest technological advancements, such as Web3, NFTs, and the Metaverse. The entire idea behind the platform is to create a freelancing and recruitment platform based on Web3 to help revolutionize how freelancers connect with potential employers.\n\nThe problem with today\u2019s current state of affairs in the freelance trade is that Web2 marketplaces such as LinkedIn, Upwork, and Fiver completely dominate the industry. These platforms can offer employers and freelancers a wide range of clients but face several challenges. For example, there\u2019s no control over data ownership in Web2 marketplaces, which charge high commissions and fees. Furthermore, these Web2 marketplaces are known to have long payment cycles, offer cheap services, and attract low-paying clients.\n\nThe worst part about the Web2 freelance marketplace sector is that freelancers have to outbid each other by offering huge discounts. They can also be removed from the platform at anytime, preventing their ability to work and provide for their families. For example, UpWork purged over 2 million freelancers deemed \u201cless skilled\u201d in 2020.\n\nThis is precisely the problem that DeeLance attempts to overhaul.\n\nDeelance has created a next-generation freelancing platform that\u2019s built on three ecosystem pillars:\n\nAn Innovative Recruitment Platform. An NFT Marketplace. A Revolutionary Metaverse.\n\nTogether, these products provide a suite of tools and services designed to streamline and improve the freelance process.\n\nThe innovative recruitment platform is the flagship product from DeeLance, allowing employers to post job offers and freelancers to hunt for work. The system is designed to decentralize the entire process while keeping freelancers and employers secure.\n\nOne of the mechanisms used to ensure transparency in the ecosystem is the automated dispute system, which stores all reputations of buyers and sellers on the platform. The system integrates a client feedback score which measures the average score provided by clients to freelancers on the platform. It helps to indicate the level of satisfaction and work quality delivered by freelancers. There\u2019s also a freelancer success rate to measure the percentage of tasks completed by freelancers and a task completion time to measure the duration of each job.\n\nFurthermore, the platform is designed to totally simplify the business process. For example, posting a job or applying for one only takes a minute. In addition, no third-party apps, browser plugins, credit cards, or wallet linking are required on the platform, making it extremely fast and efficient. The system also uses a smart contract escrow system to guarantee freelancers receive service payments. The escrow ensures that employers\u2019 funds are stored safely until the work is submitted to the specifications required.\n\nIn addition, freelancers can charge much lower fees because employers are directly connected to freelancers. The commission is also the lowest in the industry, as DeeLance charges a 2% commission, much lower than the 20% charged on Fiverr.\n\nDeeLance has also integrated an innovative NFT feature to guarantee platform ownership. All freelancer work submitted is turned into NFTs to ensure recruiters get ownership of the work they\u2019re paying for, protecting them against payment fraud or copyright violation.\n\nThe platform also integrates subscription NFTs into the ecosystem to provide discounts for participants. For example, those that purchase one of the 5,000 General NFTs will have all platform fees waived. Unique and Pro NFTs also offer plots of land and offices in the Metaverse, designed to allow buyers to interact with freelancers in office spaces to have meetings through voice or video conferencing.\n\nDeeLance is currently undergoing a presale for its native token, $DLANCE, which can be used to purchase subscription NFTs, acquire land and offices within the Metaverse, pay for freelance services, or acquire advertising. The token is designed to provide users with a seamless transaction process to improve their experience.\n\nThe presale is currently in the first stage, selling the token for a price of $0.025. However, the presale uses an increasing pricing strategy, increasing the token\u2019s price during each subsequent presale stage. For example, in stage two, the price for the token will increase to $0.027. Then, it will continue rising until stage six, which will sell the token for $0.035. Therefore, those purchasing in the earlier stages benefit the most as they will have more unrealized gains when the token finally launches on exchanges at $0.037.\n\nOverall, DeeLance has created a groundbreaking solution to the freelance economy, providing a secure and transparent method for freelancers and employers to find what they\u2019re looking for seamlessly.\n\nVisit DeeLance Today\n\n2. Chainlink \u2013 DeFi\u2019s Most Important Cryptocurrency Project\n\nChainlink is, without a doubt, the most important cryptocurrency project in the DeFi sector. The project is a decentralized Oracle service that helps to bring off-chain data into smart contracts. In effect, it helps to bridge the gap between closed blockchain systems and the open world \u2013 allowing smart contracts on a wide range of networks to reach their full potential.\n\nMost cryptocurrency projects\u2019 problems are that each chain can only utilize the data already on that specific blockchain. As a result, data outside the blockchain is inaccessible, and projects require an Oracle service to integrate this type of data, which is precisely what Chainlink provides.\n\nThe introduction of Chainlink into the cryptocurrency sector completely changed the dynamics of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It helped to bring data from outside blockchains into smart contracts to execute certain parameters.\n\nThe off-chain data is provided by oracles within the system, who are incentivized to provide accurate data to ensure their reputation score remains high. Data providers are required to stake LINK, the native token behind the platform, to ensure that they act as honestly as possible, as they stand to lose money if they provide inaccurate data. For those that act honestly and provide data, the Chainlink ecosystem rewards them with LINK tokens for their efforts.\n\nSome outside data that Oracles can report include event data, data feeds, payment methods, and pricing data. These datasets allowed DeFi to morph into a truly decentralized financial ecosystem, giving birth to a new breed of projects. For example, Chainlink forms the basis of most of the decentralized exchanges in the sector, allowing smart contracts to receive the prices of assets to facilitate trading.\n\nThe recent market capitulation presented a fantastic opportunity to re-invest in the LINK token before it starts its recovery. LINK managed to reach as high as $50 during the peak of the bull market. However, it currently sits beneath $10, providing sizable gains in the next wave higher. Furthermore, its market cap is much lower than Ripple\u2019s, meaning greater upside potential exists.\n\n3. Binance Token \u2013 The Native Token Behind the World\u2019s Largest Exchange\n\nBinance token, BNB, is the native token behind the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange \u2013 Binance. It\u2019s also the cryptocurrency that powers the BNB Chain ecosystem and helps to provide discounts to traders on the Binance exchange.\n\nThe token launched with an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017 and has since grown into one of the most popular tokens as it currently sits in the 4th ranked position with a market cap size of $50 billion.\n\nBinance used a clever token-burning mechanism to help increase the value of the token by removing BNB from the circulating supply, making the token more scarce. The exchange used one-fifth of the profits generated on the exchange to buy back BNB from the open market and burn them \u2013 removing them from circulation. This tactic helped BNB become one of the largest tokens in the industry.\n\nThe best part about BNB is the utility it provides for traders. It allows users to pay platform fees on the exchange, providing them with a discount of 25% on Spot Trading fees. In addition, those that use BNB on the Margin Trading platform also receive 25% off their fees, with an additional 10% discount for Futures Trading.\n\nThe platform continued adding utility for the token, such as providing users the first chance to invest in projects launching on the Binance Launchpad platform. Users were required to hold a specific number of BNB to be eligible for investment, which caused a large number of investors to hoard BNB.\n\nAlthough Binance is currently facing regulatory scrutiny, the BNB token still has its place in the industry. The best part about BNB is that it can grow in any market condition, including bear markets. This is because everybody needs somewhere to trade, even if the overall market declines. As a result, BNB provides a fantastic opportunity to invest in a token that can continue growing as the cryptocurrency ecosystem grows.\n\n4. Chiliz \u2013 The Budding Fan Token Experience\n\nChiliz is the native cryptocurrency behind the Socios fan engagement ecosystem that allows fans to purchase branded NFTs from their favorite sports stars, teams, and entertainers. Using the Socios platform, fans can easily access exclusive merchandise, experiences, and early-bird tickets for their favorite teams, creating an ecosystem that lets them directly engage with their heroes.\n\nCurrently, Chiliz allows fans to purchase merchandise and experiences through 82 different fan tokens. Some of these tokens include mammoth teams, such as Paris-Saint Germain, Manchester City, Napoli FC, and Barcelona FC.\n\nThe fan tokens also allow fans to vote on specific polls created by the team. A great example was Juventus FC, which created a poll to let token holders decide the celebration song that would be played over the loudspeaker each time the team scored a goal. Fans at Barcelona chose a mural to hang in the team\u2019s dressing room, and fans of PSG chose a message to be written on the captain\u2019s armband.\n\nFans were limited to watching teams and purchasing merchandise in their stores before the Chiliz ecosystem was created. Now, they\u2019re able to get more direct interactions with the teams they admire on a weekly basis. At the same time, the ecosystem helps sports franchises to monetize their fan base in novel ways by providing their fans with some of the most interactive experiences imaginable.\n\nChiliz presents a fantastic investment opportunity because the project has a clearly defined business strategy to move forward and continue growing. In addition, the utility provided by the ecosystem means there will always be a need for the CHZ token because there will always be millions of fans that are willing to interact with their favorite teams. These fans are required to use CHZ tokens to be able to purchase the fan tokens of their teams.\n\nOverall, Chiliz is a unique project in the space, and the partnerships already created put them miles ahead of the competition.\n\n5. Basic Attention Token \u2013 The Token Revolutionizing Online Advertising\n\nBasic Attention Token is the native token used to pay for advertising in the Brave Browser \u2013 one of the fastest and most secure web browsers on the internet. The Brave Browser has created a private advertising network that pays users for viewing advertisements in BAT tokens. The idea behind the platform is to create an advertising network where viewers are actually interested in the projects being advertised to them while earning a reward for their attention.\n\nThe Brave Browser and the BAT token were created by the co-founder of Firefox, Brendan Eich, to increase security and privacy for users while browsing the internet. The Brave Browser automatically blocks all cookies and trackers on the internet and removes all advertisements from traditional methods. This means that users won\u2019t see any advertisements on YouTube or web pages when browsing on Brave \u2013 except for those in the private ad network.\n\nBAT can be used to obtain advertising services on the platform. Advertisers are required to pay for services in the native token, providing it with a fantastic use case. The token is also a medium of exchange between fans and content creators, allowing fans to tip their favorite creators for the content they enjoy consuming regularly.\n\nThe project aims to overhaul the advertising industry in the digital realm. Instead of benefiting publishers, the new system lets advertisers reach their target audience while rewarding those being advertised to. In addition, the system is designed so that a viewer is attentive when they see an advertisement, which should result in better results for those advertising.\n\nCurrently, there are around 21 million active users on the Brave Browser, creating a huge user base for advertisers to advertise their products. In addition, there are around 10.6 million BAT wallets, with over 2 million creators signed up to receive tips from their fans.\n\nOverall, Basic Attention Token has secured its place in the advertising sector and will continue to grow as more people download the Brave Browser.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, XRP presented incredible growth opportunities for investors in the early days of the cryptocurrency market. However, the industry has evolved considerably since then, and the opportunity for additional growth through XRP is relatively limited at this stage.\n\nNevertheless, with utility rising to the forefront of the industry again, there are plenty of opportunities available for people to invest in XRP alternatives that provide considerable upside potential.\n\nAll the projects on this list are great alternatives to Ripple with bigger potential growth. We believe the presale opportunity provided by DeeLance is the best option on this list. The decentralized freelance platform is expected to totally revolutionize the space, pushing the billion-dollar industry into the Web3 realm with a new wave of benefits.\n\nOverall, once DeeLance launches and freelancers start to use the platform, the native token behind the project will see immense growth.\n\nVisit the DeeLance Presale Today\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.
