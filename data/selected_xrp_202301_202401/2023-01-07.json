        "title": "Israel\u2019s far right hits ground running, and ripple effects are already being felt - The Guardian",
        "content": "Glancing up and staring directly into the camera, the suspect who broke into the centuries-old Jerusalem cemetery appears to spot the CCTV equipment recording his hate crime. Seemingly unfazed, he looks down again, focusing on the task at hand \u2013 pushing over a stone cross and smashing it to pieces.\n\nThe two young males who vandalised more than 30 Christian graves last weekend showed little concern about hiding their identities while carrying out a religiously motivated attack. They did not cover their faces as they systematically destroyed headstones on a bright Sunday afternoon in the heart of the holy city. Such is the confidence with which the suspects, believed to be teenage Israeli extremists arrested on Friday, now operate.\n\nAnd why not operate with confidence? The new ultranationalist religious rulers of Israel, sworn in just days before, include people who share their view of Jewish supremacy. One cabinet minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, made his name as an ideological firebrand lawyer defending exactly the same sort of far-right Jewish settlers who have conducted similar attacks against Palestinian Christians and Muslims. Now he oversees the very institution that is supposed to prevent such crimes \u2013 the police.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201cripple effect\u201d of a hard-right government coming to power, said the former Palestinian peace negotiator Diana Buttu. \u201cThe fact that they desecrated those graves, it\u2019s not coming out of the blue \u2013 it\u2019s because they can.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s new government is the most far-right in the country\u2019s relatively short history, and it has hit the ground running. In little more than a week, the administration has made moves towards the largest expulsion of Palestinians from the West Bank since the occupation began. It has allowed the hardline minister Ben-Gvir to stage a provocative visit to a sacred mosque compound \u2013 an act that has previously led to an intifada. It has announced a plan to gut the judiciary, which, despite already leaning to the hard right, is still seen as a thorn in the side of Israeli politicians who want direct control of Palestinian and Israeli life, with no checks.\n\nAll this was made possible because political survivor Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, made deals with politicians once seen as radicals. He needed them to form a coalition government, and in the process, he mainstreamed the far right.\n\nIsrael\u2019s politics has not suddenly lurched to ideological extremes. In big picture terms, Ben-Gvir and other settlers in the new government share the same goals as Netanyahu, and even many of Israel\u2019s self-proclaimed centrist and leftwing politicians: ultimate control in perpetuity.\n\nIn a tweet in Hebrew, Netanyahu made very clear the ideological pillars of the new administration. \u201cThe Jewish people have an exclusive and unquestionable right to all areas of the Land of Israel,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe government will promote and develop settlement in all parts of the Land of Israel,\u201d he added, including the occupied West Bank.\n\nButtu said Israeli governments of the past had tried to keep Palestinians \u201cinvisible\u201d to Israeli voters, even while entrenching the occupation, and diverted attention instead to less emotive issues such as the economy or bus schedules.\n\n\u201cPrevious Israeli governments had the same plans as this current government, which is to take as much Palestinian land as possible, blockade the Gaza Strip, build and expand settlements, and kill Palestinians with impunity,\u201d said Buttu.\n\n\u201cThe difference is that with this government, their sole political platform is against Palestinians,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no longer a veneer.\u201d\n\nUS diplomats in Jerusalem are squirming in their attempts to carry out difficult political contortions, talking about working towards a future Palestinian state while knowing very well that the Israeli government Washington claims to support seeks the opposite. It\u2019s hard not to trip up.\n\n\u201cWith this government, there is no pretence,\u201d wrote Hadar Susskind, the president of the nonprofit Americans for Peace Now. \u201cDe facto annexation is a part of its platform. It is explicitly a chief goal of its members. The occupation is the rot at the core of this putrid government.\u201d\n\nEven the Israeli right wing, victorious after a decades-long political battle to snuff out domestic anti-occupation voices, is starting to fret that it may have overstepped.\n\nDavid Horovitz, the editor of the Times of Israel newspaper, wrote how Israelis were now worried that Netanyahu had made too many concessions to his far-right and ultra-Orthodox allies.\n\nBut, he wrote: \u201cThat ship, voters and lovers of Israel, has sailed.\u201d"

        "content": "CLAIM: A facebook user recently claimed that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers States had endorsed the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, and also promised him votes in his state.\n\n\n\nVERDICT: False\n\nREAD ALSO:FACT CHECK: Did Tinubu mark 69th birthday in 2012?\n\nFULL TEXT\n\nIn the facebook post, which has multiple likes and shares, Wike was quoted to have pledged to give Obi votes from Rivers that would surpass those from Kaduna, Kano and Zamfara.\n\nThe post read: \u201cThe votes I will give Peter Obi in Rivers will collapse every vote (sic) coming in Kano and Kaduna with Zamfara combined \u2013 Wike\u201d\n\nThe post was accompanied with a picture of Wike and Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State wearing the same native attire and abeti-aja cap of the Yoruba people.\n\nVERDICT\n\nRipples Nigeria could not find any trace of the quote in the media. Also, a google reversed image search of the attached picture shows that it was taken at the flag off campaign of Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, who is seeking a second term in office. The campaign rally held at the Mapo Hall, Ibadan on Wednesday.\n\nWe found the recording of Wike\u2019s address at the rally and nowhere in it did he endorse Peter Obi or promise him votes.\n\nWike, G5, and the 2023 Presidential election\n\nGovernor Wike is the leader of a protestant group of five governors of the PDP who are opposed to their party\u2019s presidential candidate and its national leadership. They are tagged the G5 Governors. Other members of the group are: Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu; Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State.\n\nWike and the other governors had met with Presidential candidates of opposition parties, including Obi and Bola Tinubu of the All Progressive Congress, but they are yet to adopt a candidate. Although Wike had said he would disclose his Presidential candidate in January, he is yet to do so.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe claim that Governor Wike promised Obi votes in Rivers is false.\n\nJoin the conversation\n\nOpinions\n\nSupport Ripples Nigeria, hold up solutions journalism\n\nBalanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.\n\nAs a media platform, we hold leadership accountable and will not trade the right to press freedom and free speech for a piece of cake.\n\nIf you like what we do, and are ready to uphold solutions journalism, kindly donate to the Ripples Nigeria cause.\n\nYour support would help to ensure that citizens and institutions continue to have free access to credible and reliable information for societal development.\n\nDonate Now"
