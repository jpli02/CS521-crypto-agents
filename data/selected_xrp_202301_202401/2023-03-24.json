        "title": "Ripple President Weighs in on SEC Case, Regulations, Market Outlook, and More - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Long joins other executives to predict an industry departure from the U.S.\n\nIn a recent CNBC interview, Ripple President Monica Long lent her voice to several issues affecting the blockchain payments company and the industry.\n\nRecall that Long assumed the role of president in January after nearly ten years at the company.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDuring the interview, shared on YouTube two days ago, Long expressed confidence about the company\u2019s chances in its legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, the extended legal battle now awaits a ruling from the judge. The SEC claims that Ripple\u2019s sale of XRP to fund its business violates securities law, with the SEC maintaining that XRP is an unregistered security. Conversely, Ripple and most XRP holders refute the SEC\u2019s stance on the asset\u2019s classification.\n\nA positive outcome is unlikely for the SEC, according to the Ripple executive, who asserted that the facts and law favored the defendants. She also decried the dominant approach of regulation by enforcement in the U.S., pointing out that Europe was doing much better despite having about 27 sovereign states. Consequently, Long reiterated views recently shared by fellow executive Brook Entwistle that the company is focusing expansion efforts abroad.\n\nAccording to Long, fellow industry participants are downsizing due to the crypto market rout. However, Ripple continues to expand. The company president asserts this is due to its focus on real-world utility.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile it is difficult to tell whether the crypto winter has ended, the Ripple executive disclosed that she believed the industry and the technology were here to stay. For Long, it is now a matter of which jurisdictions decide to welcome it, predicting a widespread departure from the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, Long noted that the firm has continued to see customer growth in Q1, despite recent fears in the banking sector.\n\nIt is worth noting that the crypto market in the U.S. is embroiled in uncertainty as regulators, particularly the SEC crank up enforcement actions with no clear rules for the industry. As highlighted in a report yesterday, Coinbase, the top crypto exchange in the U.S., received a threat of litigation from the SEC."

        "title": "Ripple CTO David Schwartz Calls Out SEC for Lack of Clarity On Crypto Regulations | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The recent Wells notice from the SEC to Coinbase has sparked another reaction from Ripple. In a recent tweet, Ripple\u2019s CTO, David Schwartz, criticized the US Securities and Exchanges Commission for not clarifying cryptocurrency regulatory guidelines before attacking crypto firms.\n\nSchwartz\u2019s comment was in response to Paul Grewal, chief legal officer to Coinbase\u2019s statement asking the SEC to provide rules for crypto in the United States. The Wells Notice comes amid several enforcement actions by the SEC on crypto firms alleging unregistered securities offerings.\n\nRipple And Coinbase Challenge Seek SEC To Provide Clear Guidelines For Crypto\n\nCoinbase recently received a Wells notice from the SEC alleging the exchange\u2019s staking services offer unregistered securities. As a formal notification, the Wells Notice suggests the regulator is availing Coinbase an opportunity to respond to its allegation before deciding to take legal action.\n\nHowever, through its chief legal officer, Coinbase complained about the SEC not giving them room and guidelines when they sought to register their business operations. The exchange also noted that the watchdog did not provide ample information in the notice to respond.\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase frequently affirmed that no asset listed on its platform or staking services is security. Following Grewal\u2019s statements in a recent blog post, Coinbase appears ready to face the SEC to defend its case.\n\nWhile the controversy around this case continues to escalate, Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty released a comment via a tweet yesterday. The lawyer quoted an old saying \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is my friend.\u201d This statement somehow implies that Alderoty might be throwing in weight for Coinbase.\n\nThe Ripple CTO Schwartz\u2019s comments come after Paul Grewal called out the SEC to provide reasonable rules for crypto, noting that Coinbase is willing to follow. Grewal thinks the SEC has been unreasonable in their moves on crypto assets, noting that legislation will serve better in defining crypto regulations than enforcement actions.\n\nHowever, the recent Wells notice has not frailed Coinbase\u2019s operations. The exchange affirmed that its activities would continue as usual while it works to clarify things with the SEC. Coinbase noted that it is open to any opportunity to get crypto regulatory transparency in court.\n\nSEC\u2019s Views On Cryptos As Securities Appear Lacking\n\nCoinbase maintains that its staking services are legal and no assets listed on its platform are security. According to Grewal, the crypto exchange has repeatedly engaged with SEC officials to get clear regulatory guidelines for its services. Coinbase affirmed its stance on the SEC by citing a ruling against the SEC by federal bankruptcy judge Michael Wiles in the recent Voyager case.\n\nThe judge\u2019s findings in the cases make it clear that the SEC\u2019s views on crypto as a security lacks clear facts, Grewal noted.\n\nAccording to the lawyer, Judge Wiles\u2019 ruling stated that the regulators have not agreed on whether cryptocurrencies are commodities subject to the CFTC oversight or securities under securities laws. These statements further buttress David Schwartz and Coinbase\u2019s criticism of the SEC.\n\nFeatured image from Voi and chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "HiFuture Ripple Bluetooth Speaker review - AndroidGuys",
        "content": "\u201cDid anybody bring a speaker?\u201d is a question my friends and I constantly ask each other when we hang out. Cookouts, tailgates, house parties, golf outings, and everything in between are improved with a high-quality, portable speaker to jam with. It wasn\u2019t until recently that I realized: I\u2019m never the friend with the speaker.\n\nDetermined to change my destiny, I looked for a new Bluetooth speaker to try. During my search, the HiFuture Ripple caught my eye. The HiFuture Ripple is a portable Bluetooth speaker comparable in size to a can of Arizona iced tea. My USB-C charging speaker is a deep blue, weighs no more than five pounds, and has a loop of paracord on the end to be tied to a backpack or belt loop.\n\nSound Quality\n\nThe most important quality of any speaker, in my opinion, is how good it sounds. Connecting the HiFuture Ripple to my phone and playing a song for the first time, I was pleased to hear the clean, high-quality sound that I expected.\n\nThe songs I listen to generally tend to lean a little top-heavy, and I am satisfied that the tweeter in this speaker doesn\u2019t seem to lose quality in its upper range.\n\nAfter a couple of songs from my own playlist cycled through I queued up Starboy by The Weeknd to try something with some more bass. Listeners who love to listen to their music with a lot of bass may not be able to get quite as much oomph from the low end of this speaker as they may prefer, but this speaker met my expectations by keeping its balanced mix while maintaining a quality sound even for bass-heavy songs.\n\nBattery Life\n\nThe HiFuture Ripple comes out of the box with a charge, which is satisfying. The claim is that the battery on this speaker will last 12 hours of listening, and I have no reason to believe anything different. I didn\u2019t listen to music for 12 hours straight, but after listening to music for one hour, 12 times, the HiFuture Ripple still had battery charge left.\n\nOne thing I did notice was that the speaker did take a long time to charge once the battery was almost gone. This was more inconvenient than it was a problem, and I was happy to charge it for a long time considering how long the battery lasted.\n\nDesign\n\nSometimes the look of a speaker is almost as important as it sounds. Especially for a portable speaker, I would much rather be carrying around a sleek, nice-looking speaker than something thick and clunky. I am happy to say that the HiFuture Ripple has a nice look refined enough to fit in at a house party, but the mesh on the exterior means it also won\u2019t feel out of place at an outdoor BBQ.\n\nAlthough its mostly round, the speaker has a ridge and two small rubber feet to keep it sitting properly and prevent it from rolling around. The buttons are the same color as the speaker so they are only visible up close, and I am a big fan of the heavily vibrating woofers on the sides. No lights or any gadgets to this speaker, which I think keeps it from looking tacky.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, the HiFuture Ripple speaker met all my expectations. It looks nice, sounds great, and can play music all day. If there was one thing to complain about, I suppose I wish that it charged faster. With my HiFuture Ripple in tow, I am excited to start being my new self as the guy who brings the speaker to the party.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nX\n\n"

        "title": "XRP and the business case for Ripple - Fortune",
        "content": "I wrote a version of this headline\u2014titled \u201cIs Ripple for real?\u201d\u2014six years ago for Fortune. At the time, and on many occasions since, I have pondered that exact question. A big reason for this is that XRP, the token often associated with Ripple, is different than other cryptocurrencies. Unlike other blockchain projects, there has never been any mining or proof-of-stake mechanism. Instead, the XRP founders simply conjured 100 billion of the tokens out of thin air in 2012, and ever since people have been trying to figure out what the stuff is for.\n\nRipple, meanwhile, has gone through more identities than Madonna. When I first heard of it in 2013, people claimed the XRP ledger was a more versatile version of Bitcoin and that it would render the original cryptocurrency obsolete. Two years later, during the \u201cblockchain not Bitcoin\u201d era, Ripple tried to be besties with the big banks\u2014only to be rudely brushed off when the banks realized they wanted nothing to do with XRP. For its next act, Ripple tried to disrupt the remittance industry\u2014giving large buckets of XRP to Western Union and MoneyGram, only to see the companies sell it all for a quick buck and then leave Ripple high and dry.\n\nRipple\u2019s ongoing efforts to butter up the banking and corporate world have made the company, and by extension XRP, an object of hostility and derision among the rest of the crypto world. For a long time, it felt like Ripple\u2019s only friend was the XRP Army\u2014a motley collection of loons, hucksters, bots, and fanatics who cheer maniacally whenever the currency is mentioned on Twitter. But in the last two years, something changed. Ripple became popular, even winning over its longtime antagonist, the crypto overlord Ryan Selkis aka TwoBitIdiot.\n\nMuch of this change of heart has come about due to Ripple\u2019s decision to go toe-to-toe with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a high-profile court case that challenges what many view as the agency\u2019s arbitrary and overreaching behavior. The enemy of my enemy is my friend and all that. But meanwhile, the company appears to have finally figured out a sustainable business strategy.\n\nI spoke with Ripple President Monica Long this week, and she told me that the last two years have been the best in the company\u2019s history thanks to the growing popularity of its cross-border payment platform, Ripple Net. The platform provides on-demand liquidity (ODL) through a network of market makers that use XRP to facilitate quick payments and settlements. In 2020, Long says ODL was available in three countries, but today the numbers have grown to 40 markets that represent 90% of the world\u2019s forex trade. She explained Ripple has found its sweet spot not with big banks, but with small- and medium-sized ones in far-flung regions that appreciate the lower transaction costs it offers and also have newer and more adaptable tech stacks. The company is now making money by way of transaction fees but also by selling its holding of XRP to clients. Long adds that Ripple has also begun selling a crypto brokerage tool called Liquidity Hub and that it has been investing heavily in making the XRP Ledger more versatile, including by integrating an Ethereum virtual machine option.\n\nAll of this is to say that Ripple, more than ever before, has figured out a long-term value proposition for both the company and XRP\u2014and that it may be poised to succeed regardless of how its big court case turns out.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nDo Kwon, the fugitive scammer who created the infamous Terra stablecoin, was arrested in Montenegro the same day the Justice Department unveiled charges against him.

        "content": "Meredith No\u00ebl, Chioma Anyanwu, Tiffany Yvonne Cox, and Gregory Warren in \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home.\u201d (Photo by Don Ipock.)\n\nWater is one of the most enduring symbols in art and literature; it can represent life, death, and the journey between, often in the form of a driving river, a rejuvenating spring, a chilling rain, or an endless ocean. (You get the idea.)\n\nIn the ripple, the wave that carried me home\u2014the superb new play by acclaimed playwright and Kansas City, Kansas, native Christina Anderson that has, well, come home to KC Rep\u2019s Copaken Stage\u2014the water in question is the kind that fills a swimming pool; it represents freedom\u2014but also futility, and decades of inequity.\n\nUnder Khanisha Foster\u2019s direction, that water imagery flows beautifully throughout the production. Before the lights even dim, Josafath Reyoso\u2019s immaculate swimming-pool set\u2014perfectly lifelike, but also dreamlike, with tiles and lane markers rising up the back wall, and ropes floating up and out, over the audience\u2014impels us to dive right in. Characters will often enter and exit the playing space as if swimming into the scene. And the script itself smoothly streams through crevices in the narrative, back and forth between the \u201cpresent\u201d\u2014specifically, 1992\u2014and flashbacks from the 1960s and \u201970s.\n\nAnderson\u2019s story swirls around its narrator, Janice (Meredith No\u00ebl), a 30-something college administrator in Ohio who has mostly separated herself from her hometown of Beacon, Kansas, where her parents had lead the movement to integrate the city\u2019s swimming pools. (Beacon may be fictional, but Black Americans\u2019 struggle for aquatic equality is direct from the recent history of Kansas City and many other places.) The inciting incident is a call\u2014rather, a series of persistent calls\u2014from \u201cYoung Chipper Ambitious Black Woman\u201d (Chioma Anyanwu) of the African-American Recognition Committee, who implores Janice to come home and speak at a ceremony honoring her late father, in whose memory the community pool will be renamed.\n\nThe invitation, and Janice\u2019s consternation over how to respond, stir a whirlpool of memories, of her parents\u2019 remarkable zeal for swimming and teaching Black children to swim, and their ongoing determination to change \u201cjust one small part of the system.\u201d Helen (Tiffany Yvonne Cox) and Edwin (Gregory Warren) are loving parents to their only child, yet she sometimes feels overshadowed by \u201cthe fight.\u201d As a teen, Janice develops her own passion for the pool\u2014until a revelation from her mother, and a particularly traumatic encounter with the police, threatens to drown that love of swimming once and (seemingly) for all. Janice\u2019s conversations with her gregarious and delightful Aunt Gayle (also Anyanwu) further link the 1992 present to the past, especially with the coverage of the Rodney King trial churning in the background.\n\nMeredith No\u00ebl and the set of \u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home.\u201d (Photo by Don Ipock.)\n\nAnderson\u2019s language is poetic, but often profoundly concise on seemingly complicated issues, peppered with lines you will want to remember (and drop into conversation). Because, yes, above all, this is a masterfully rendered, highly entertaining drama of one family, and as just that, it is worth the time and price of admission. But it is also an example of how, in the right writer\u2019s hands (and executed flawlessly by a talented cast and crew), a very specific story can unleash and illuminate much larger truths, and force us to confront them anew: Why should something as simple as equality require such struggle?\n\nJanice\u2019s journey down memory lane ultimately leads her to another realization, and a decision. The final moment borders on the sentimental, but it\u2014and the waterworks it is likely to provoke\u2014feel completely earned.\n\nFrom here, appropriately, the ripple, the wave\u2026 will flow around town as the second production of the company\u2019s community touring program, \u201cKCRep for All,\u201d with free performances scheduled at community centers, schools, public libraries, and senior centers throughout the metro area.\n\nAfter all, one of the properties of water\u2014and waves\u2014is reflection. And thanks to this beautiful production, some audience members may see themselves or their story reflected on a stage for the first time. Others will simply have the opportunity to reflect\u2014to learn, to feel, to think, and hopefully to act.\n\n\u201cthe ripple, the wave that carried me home\u201d runs at the Kansas City Repertory Theatre (Copaken Stage, 1 H&R Block Way) through April 2 before embarking on its free community tour.
