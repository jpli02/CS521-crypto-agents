        "content": "IMPD investigates overnight shooting in Broad Ripple\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (WISH) \u2014 Investigators are asking people to speak up if they know anything about a shooting in Broad Ripple early Tuesday.\n\nThe Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department is working to gather witnesses and security video so they can piece together what happened outside Connor\u2019s Pub, 6331 Ferguson St.\n\nConnor\u2019s Pub is a small bar just north of the Broad Ripple strip. It is known for food, drinks, live music, and an outdoor patio.\n\nInvestigators believe a frequent visitor at the pub shot a security guard around 1:20 a.m. IMPD says the security guard was listed in stable condition at Ascension St. Vincent Hospital.\n\nThis is not the first shooting at Connor\u2019s Pub. Last year, News 8 reported that Curtis Baker will serve an 80-year sentence for fatally shooting a part-time bouncer at the pub in 2019.\n\nThe Broad Ripple area has seen an uptick in crime in recent years. A shooting in June left three people dead and another injured, while a shooting last July sent four people to the hospital.\n\nAnyone with information that can help investigators track down the person responsible for the shooting was asked to contact IMPD or Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana."

        "content": "Officers were called to Connor's Pub on Ferguson Street just before 1:30 a.m. Nov. 28 on a report of a person shot.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 IMPD announced an arrest of a suspect who allegedly fired a shot inside a Broad Ripple bar on Nov. 28, injuring an employee.\n\nDetectives arrested a 22-year-old man on preliminary charges of aggravated battery and criminal recklessness. The Marion County Prosecutor's Office will make the final charging decision.\n\n(NOTE: 13News does not name suspects until charges have been filed by prosecutors.)\n\nOfficers were called to Connor's Pub on Ferguson Street just before 1:30 a.m. Nov. 28 on a report of a person shot. Police tell 13News the bar staff asked a customer to leave because he had a firearm and he fired one shot, hitting an employee.\n\n\"What we see here is we have one individual who made a bad decision and brought a firearm to a location and made a bad decision with that firearm,\" IMPD North District Commander Matthew Thomas said.\n\nAccording to court documents, an employee who was working security saw the suspect get into an argument with a waitress, so the security guard tried to deescalate the situation. The security guard allegedly asked the suspect to leave, and as the suspect was walking out, he pulled out a gun, told the security guard he would kill him and fired one shot toward the front of the bar.\n\nDennis Pyron said he was a regular at the bar and came by Tuesday to check on staff.\n\n\"Long-time resident, I'm dismayed about what's happened to Broad Ripple as far as the violence,\" Payton said. \"We'd get in there and we'd have a rumble. Typical bar fight, a rumble. It was great fun, but nobody pulled out a knife or a gun, ever.\"\n\nIMPD didn't say if Connor's Pub was considered a nuisance property, but said this is one of Indy's safest neighborhoods.\n\n\"In Broad Ripple, we actually see almost zero crime,\" Thomas said. \"Unfortunately, when we do have instances of violence, it's notable because we have such a tight-knit community.\"\n\nPolice said they have seen a 38% decrease in violent crime in Broad Ripple compared to this time last year.\n\n\"And that's outpacing what we're seeing in the entire city as a whole,\" said Thomas, who credits, in part, crime prevention strategies implemented this summer. \"We'll have discussions with our business owners, patrons who are visiting. What are you experiencing? What needs do you have? What changes can we make?\""

        "content": "If you couldn\u2019t make it to some of the biggest concerts of the year, no problem. Some of them are coming to a theater near you.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s film, \u201cRenaissance\u201d comes out this Friday, and Taylor Swift recently announced that the \u201cEras Tour Concert Film\u201d will hit a number of streaming platforms on Dec. 13.\n\nPamela Henson, a self-proclaimed Swiftie, didn\u2019t make it to Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras Tour.\u201d But she did make it to the \u201cEras Tour Concert Film.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone was dressed up,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd some of them, you almost had to do a double take because they were exactly like the album cover \u2014 I mean to the tee.\u201d\n\nHenson is director of media at Marcus Theatres, which has locations in 17 states. She\u2019s seen the \u201cEras Tour Concert Film\u201d multiple times and every time she said people can barely stay in their seats.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to \u2018shh, be quiet and put your phone away.\u2019 We want people to get up and dance as if they\u2019re at the \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert,\u201d Henson said.\n\nMarcus Theatres will also screen the Beyonc\u00e9 film, with prizes for attendees who are best decked out in their best Alien Superstar looks.\n\nBetween the big screen and speakers, concert films are making going to the movies a special event, said Michael O\u2019Leary at the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cThe theater\u2019s a place where you can recreate that kind of concert-like feel.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a month, the Taylor Swift movie still consistently ranks in the top five for ticket sales, O\u2019Leary noted. Movie theaters share those profits with distributors and filmmakers, but many also capitalize on the moment by offering fun merchandise and themed drinks. And theaters retain most of the profit from those sales.\n\nWith concert movies, theaters have the chance profit off of themed merchandise. (Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really no different than if you were to go see a concert live and you see the people kind of queuing up to get a concert t-shirt or a sweatshirt,\u201d said O\u2019Leary.\n\nNot every artist will draw the same kind of movie crowds as Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. But, according to Daniel Loria at Boxoffice Pro, even if a lesser known artist is going on tour, it makes sense to invest a little extra to put out a film.\n\n\u201cAnd I think it redefines the potential of having on-demand, live events being recorded and remarketed down the line for a separate audience and a separate revenue for these recording artists,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s especially lucrative since artists earn less money from people streaming their music and more money from touring, Loria added.\n\nAriana Rosas contributed to this reporting."

At some point that customer allegedly fired a shot through the door grazing the security guard.\n\nWRTV\n\nA 22-year-old man was arrested for aggravated battery and criminal recklessness for his alleged role in the incident.\n\n\"What we see here is we have one individual who made a bad decision and brought a firearm to a location and made a bad decision with that firearm,\" said IMPD North District Commander Matthew Thomas.\n\nA single bullet hole can be seen through the inside door at Connor's Pub.\n\nWRTV\n\nNorth District Commander Thomas said although Indiana is an open carry state, that doesn't mean guns are allowed everywhere.\n\n\"Private establishments have ability to restrict entry of firearms into those establishments,\" Thomas said.\n\nWRTV\n\nThe security guard has been released from the hospital, but his injury is concerning for Dennis Pyron.\n\n\"I am longtime resident. I am dismayed about what is happening to Broad Ripple as far as violence,\" Pyron said.\n\nPryon used to visit the dive bar frequently. Tuesday, he stopped by to check on the employees.\n\n\"It was never like that when I was a kid. I'm 63 now. I've been coming here since I was 16,\" Pyron said. \"There are too many guns on the streets. The wrong people have them. They are using them to settle disputes for simple, stupid [ ].\"\n\nIn June, three people were killed and another injured after a shooting in Broad Ripple.\n\nMetro police, the city, Broad Ripple Village Association and business owners temporarily shut bars down earlier.\n\nIMPD also increased police presence, and added more cameras and lightning to the area.\n\n\"So, we still have a lot of our plan in place from the summer and we continue to assess every week and make modifications to that and what we will continue to see.\n\nWe talk with business owners, patrons, on what needs to you have, what changes can we make, one of those changes might be changing the lighting in the area,\" said Commander Thomas.\n\nCommander Thomas said up until this incident, there has been dramatic progress deterring crime.\n\n\"In Broad Ripple, we actually see almost zero crime. Unfortunately, when we do have incidents of violence it's very notable because we have such a tight knit community. In fact, in Broad Ripple year to date we've seen a decrease of over 38% in violent crime and that's outpacing in what we are seeing in the entire city as a whole,\" said Commander Thomas."

        "content": "FOX POINT \u2014 When you walk into this Fox Point guitar and repair shop, you'd expect to hear guitars being tuned and played. And you do. But downstairs in the basement there is a different kind of musical tone being played. It's the rhythmic sound of folding cardboard boxes, ripping bubble wrap, and taping packages.\n\nBeneath the Milwaukee Guitar Collective a young man is pursuing his musical dream, but he isn't playing any instruments.\n\n\u201cWe are a niche little online record shop. So we primarily focus on genres that you might not find a lot of or much of at a normal record stop,\" Peter Klein said.\n\nJames Groh Peter Klein is the owner of the niche online record shop, Ripple Records.\n\nHe's the owner and sole employee of Ripple Records. It's an online record shop that focuses on more niche genres and bands. The casual music fan won't recognize many of the records here. Klein carries artists like Yellow Magic Orchestra and Mariya Takeuchi from Japan. He has the video game soundtracks from Tekken, the movie soundtracks of the original Halloween and Mothra, 70's Japanese disco, underground hip-hop, and electronic artists you've never heard of. Given their unique nature, these records cost between $20-$100.\n\n\"Like soundtracks for pinball machines or just slot machine sounds. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve got here. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s on vinyl. I think it's cool. I think it's neat. There\u2019s a little bit of a demand for it, other weirdos like me,\" Klein said.\n\nJames Groh This is Ripple Record's office space in the basement of the Milwaukee Guitar Collective.\n\nRipple Records started in 2022. Klein loves vinyl and unconventional bands. He sold records in college and wanted a way to keep pursuing his passion when he graduated. When he found the space beneath Milwaukee Guitar Collective he got to work immediately.\n\n\"Peter's been great ever since I met him I knew he was really passionate about records. His knowledge is untapped for his age. He really impresses me. It's great to have him, and he\u2019s a great asset to the business just because records go along with guitars,\" Jon Tabers-Kwak the co-owner of Milwaukee Guitar Collective said.\n\nKlein gets his niche records in a few ways. The majority of it comes from deals with distributors. That's how he ended up with some of his international artists and sealed records. However, a lot of work comes from networking and research.\n\n\"People who might have known artists when they weren't as big, I'll message them, and say do you happen to have any of their stuff are you interested in selling it,\" Klein said.\n\nJames Groh This is a majority of Ripple Record's inventory. While it's not particularly large, these vinyls are more expensive and allow Klein to sell fewer to be profitable.\n\nThat's how he ends up with test batches released by companies or one-offs that you can't necessarily find on Spotify.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fun to find these unique oddities,\" he said.\n\nOpening a niche record store company as the price ofvinyl gets more expensive can be seen as a risky move by some. But Klein believes his gamble will pay off.\n\n\"I'm young. I can take a risk. I might as well,\" he said.\n\nHe doesn't plan to be in the basement forever either. Eventually, he wants to open a small boutique-type storefront and have more face-to-face interactions with his customers. But right now, there is no place he'd rather be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to be like hey you\u2019re in a basement. That\u2019s a little strange, and it is. There\u2019s no denying that. But I\u2019m just happy to have a space where I\u2019m doing what I love.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s playing to his own tune, and that\u2019s the sweetest type of music there is.\n\nIt\u2019s about time to watch on your time.
