        "title": "Ripple Effect: Medford Police upgrade patrol cameras as vehicle thefts spike - KTVL",
        "content": "Medford City Council recently approved a five-year $370,000 contract with that will outfit all 35 Medford Police patrol vehicles with new cameras.\n\nMedford Police say the purpose of the upgrades is to give officers better tools to help locate vehicles associated with crimes. One of the biggest tools it\u2019s adding to all of its patrol vehicles is Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be a great tool. They\u2019re excited about it, we\u2019re all excited about it,\u201d Medford Police Patrol Lt. Rebecca Pietila said. \u201cBecause that ability to capture vehicles of interest is going to be exponentially increased.\u201d\n\nAccording to Axon\u2019s website, two ALPR cameras on top of each patrol car can spot license plates of interest up to 50 feet away if they\u2019re visible to the naked eye and alert officers immediately.\n\n\n\nALPR works by recognizing license plate numbers associated with crimes. Once a vehicle\u2019s license plate is entered into MPD\u2019s system, the new Axon readers can scan three lanes of traffic to locate it.\n\n\n\nWith these cameras, the officers are going to get an automatic alert that they\u2019ve passed by this vehicle, and then a photo of that vehicle so we can take action right away,\u201d Pietila said. \u201cWhereas if a police officer was just driving down the road, they may or may not see that car and recognize it to be stolen and/or a suspect vehicle.\u201d\n\nShe said this new contract will add Axon\u2019s ALPR system to 26 more patrol vehicles and upgrade the nine MPD patrol vehicles that already have a different system. The , which is the full package MPD has purchased, will also give each vehicle a new dashcam and a wider-angle camera in the back seat to watch a suspect\u2019s activity from head to toe.\n\nThese additions come at a time when vehicle thefts have dramatically increased in Medford, Pietila said.\n\nUp until 10 years ago, Pietila says Medford had about 100 to 200 vehicle thefts per year.\n\nFast forward to 2021 and Medford had 252 vehicle thefts. In 2022, that number was 392, a 55.5% increase in vehicle thefts from the year before.\n\nMedford City Councilor Kevin Stine says the rise in vehicle thefts was one of the reasons it was an immediate and unanimous yes vote for city councilors to approve the new camera upgrades last month. Stine said it was also a quick approval because they have seen the success of the nine ALPR systems they already have on MPD vehicles.\n\n\n\nNews10 asked Stine what makes him say the ALPR units have been successful when vehicle thefts have dramatically increased.\n\nI think it just has to do with crime. Even if you have a way to catch the criminals easier, it might not deter someone,\u201d Stine said. \u201cGenerally, it seems like the type of person to commit a crime is not really thinking about the consequences or their likelihood of getting caught. There are just maybe different societal issues on why people would be more willing to steal cars.\u201d\n\nStine said the councilors agreed these camera upgrades are a smart way to use taxpayer money.\n\n\u201cEverything that you want to do is going to come at a cost. But when you look at, I think this is roughly $75,000 per year to outfit all of the police cars with cameras,\u201d Stine said. \u201cFor the benefits, that seems like a small price to pay. We know it\u2019s a successful program, and that having the technology on all police cars is a good thing for the city.\u201d\n\nThe proposal was presented by and approved by the city council. Lieutenant Pietila said this new contract will save taxpayers money over their current system because MPD is using just one company for all its cameras instead of the two they currently pay.\n\n\u201cEssentially there\u2019s a cost associated with Axon, which is a company that we work with and they provide tools for us,\u201d Pietila said. \u201cAnd then ALPR [the old system] is a different company. So the cost of those two current items is more than the revamping going to this entire new system.\u201d\n\nNews10 sent an email to Pietila and Medford City spokesperson Kristina Wilson to find out how much taxpayer money the new contract will save, but has not received a response. Once News10 receives a response, this article will be updated with that information.\n\n\n\nNot only with these upgrades bring MPD new cameras, but they will also bring new features.\n\n\u201cNow, we\u2019ve got live streaming capabilities. So our command staff can live stream incidents that are happening in front of police cars or within police cars,\u201d Pietila said. \u201cSo we have that ability, which we haven\u2019t had before. Additionally, we have really great GPS abilities with these cameras.\u201d\n\nPietila explained how this new live-streaming ability to access officers\u2019 car cameras and body cameras in real time could be a game-changer.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur ability to be outside of a critical incident and be able to view what\u2019s going on is a really, really great tool and resource for us,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if we\u2019re removed as an incident commander, we can look at what\u2019s going on and offer feedback or come up with a plan, a tactical plan, while watching what\u2019s happening right in front of our eyes.\u201d\n\nCity councilor Stine said he\u2019s excited to see the impact these new upgrades will have on locating vehicles associated with crimes and making live plans to bring them to justice.\n\nHe said these tools will be helpful even though they might not be something residents often think about.\n\nPeople might not think about it until you need it, then you\u2019re happy that MPD has the ability to retrieve your car if it\u2019s stolen,\u201d Stine said. \u201cThis might not matter to you until those types of negative things occur.\u201d\n\nNews10 asked Stine about the potential negative aspects of this new technology coming to MPD.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the concern about collecting data. There is the thought, \u2018is this data going to go in the wrong hands? Who has access to it?' Things like that,\u2019\u201d Stine said. \u201cSo that\u2019s one of the things I heard, which I understand. But this is not something where anyone in the police force can just go and mine through data and find things that are unrelated to police work. That\u2019s just not available. This is solely for the criminal activity portion of what the capabilities are.\u201d\n\nStine and Pietila both said they\u2019re not exactly sure when all 35 cars will have the cameras from the Axon Fleet 3 package because of the time it takes to install them. The department\u2019s new contract with Axon starts in July, so the cameras and features should be installed sometime this year."
