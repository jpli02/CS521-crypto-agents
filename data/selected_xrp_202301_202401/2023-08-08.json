        "content": "South Korean prosecutors investigating last year\u2019s US$40 billion collapse of Terra-Luna are looking to submit the recent U.S. ruling on Ripple cryptocurrency to a Seoul court to prove the Luna cryptocurrency as financial securities, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor\u2019s Office confirmed with Forkast.\n\nSee related article: After U.S. court rules Ripple XRP is not a security, industry remains cautious\n\nFast facts\n\nThe Seoul Southern District Prosecutor\u2019s Office recently received a translated version of the ruling on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple Labs on the sale of XRP cryptocurrency, a spokesperson for the prosecutor\u2019s office told Forkast via text message on Tuesday.\n\nSeoul prosecutors plan to submit the XRP ruling to the local court to prove Terraform Labs\u2019 Luna cryptocurrency as financial securities. Prosecutors accuse Terraform Labs co-founders Kwon Do-hyeong and Shin Hyun-seung of multiple charges including fraud and unregistered offerings of financial securities.\n\nOn July 13, the U.S. Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Ripple Labs\u2019 programmatic sales of the XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as the offer and sale of financial securities. However, the court concluded that Ripple\u2019s institutional sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of securities.\n\nDan Sung-han, the director of Seoul Southern District\u2019s joint financial crimes team, said that the latter part of the ruling can be utilized for the benefit of proving Terra\u2019s offerings of Luna cryptocurrency as a breach of securities regulations, according to a Monday report by local news outlet Maeil Business News.\n\nMeanwhile, Terra co-founder Kwon is currently detained in Montenegro for attempting to travel with forged passports, while a Seoul court held the first preliminary hearing for Shin and seven ex-Terra employees on July 10.\n\nKwon is also wanted in the U.S. under similar charges of fraud, securities law violations and several others related to the collapse. He has said that the charges against him were baseless and politically motivated.\n\nSee related article: Seoul prosecutors chasing Do Kwon establish crypto investigations team"

Welcome back to another episode of Public Key. This is your host, Ian Andrews, very excited to be joined today by Lewis Cohen, who is the co-founder of DLX Law. Lewis, welcome to the podcast.\n\nLewis:\n\nHey, man, thanks for having me.\n\nIan:\n\nNow, as people who are regular listeners to the show are well aware, I am the furthest thing from a securities lawyer, but I\u2019ve been reading nonstop lately about the Ripple case, as I think probably everyone who\u2019s in the orbit of the crypto ecosystem has. And I am mystified as to what the judge has actually ruled on. So I think today we\u2019re going to spend the bulk of the time really trying to dig into that and see if we can get me to a feeling like I\u2019m slightly competent on the topic. That would be a big win. But you\u2019ve been in the space for a long, long time. I\u2019d love to start with a little bit of your background and how you came to focus on this area of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and the impacts to securities laws.\n\nLewis:\n\nSure. Thanks. Yeah, I started my career in another offbeat area some years ago. Years ago. And that was in the world of asset-backed securities. And asset asset-backed securities at the time, especially as a young lawyer, I got involved, were very different from anything else that had come before, and a whole new set of rules, regulations, and ways of dealing had to address them because with asset-backed securities, you take basically a pile of mortgages, or credit card obligations, or things like that, you put them into a legal entity that really does not do anything, it just sits there. Some people call it a brain-dead entity, and then it sells some sort of interest in that.\n\nAnd if you think about it, it looks a lot like a DAI, a multi-collateral vault, because in many ways that\u2019s exactly what it is. And so we had to develop new sorts of rules, disclosures, and ways of dealing with this. And I worked extensively with the SEC during that period to figure out how to do that. There was a period of probably about the better part of 10 years before the SEC came up with disclosure rules, which ultimately became called regulation AEB, asset-backed.\n\nSo despite the fact that we see the chair of the SEC saying today, \u201cCome in, and register, and everything works fine.\u201d The reality is that in the past and other circumstances, the SEC have modified the rules to address different and unusual circumstances. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Some things were made more tight, some things that didn\u2019t apply were ignored. For example, when you had a securitization transaction, nobody said, \u201cWe need financial statements.\u201d Because it wasn\u2019t particularly relevant. Instead, they provided statistical data about the performance of the mortgages or other things. And I think that\u2019s the direction we see and we\u2019ll, I\u2019m sure, talk a little bit more about in some of the legislation on both the House side and the Senate side, going, \u201cHey, let\u2019s rethink what disclosures are needed. Let\u2019s make sure the right disclosures are provided, but not set up rules that are sort of functionally impossible to comply with.\u201d\n\nSo based on that background, when I first learned about this idea of, and sometimes we say blockchain and it gets a little bit of a skew look, \u201cIt\u2019s crypto, man, it\u2019s crypto. Don\u2019t you know?\u201d And I agree with that. But when I first learned about this, I said, \u201cThis feels a lot like what I\u2019ve been doing for much of my career.\u201d And I got very interested. And I was at a large law firm. And I said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s dive right in. Let\u2019s make this happen.\u201d And it became clear to me, though, that large law firms didn\u2019t really understand what was going on under the hood. I had the real privilege and honor to work with Consensus, the company, in some of their earliest projects. And so you\u2019re there at the beating heart of really what\u2019s going on in the Ethereum community and a lot of the different things, and learning, and understanding.\n\nAnd I said, \u201cHm. This is different than things I\u2019ve done before.\u201d And ultimately we decided if we wanted to do this the right way, we need to start our own law firm, which my co-founder, Angela Angelovska-Wilson and I did in May of 2018. So our firm is about five years old now. And we help people almost exclusively working with crypto assets in one way or another. Some of those may be very large organizations that are traditional organizations, many that you guys at Chainalysis serve, but also others as well, much smaller startups, and others. And really what we believe is critical for anyone as a lawyer working in the space is you got to understand what\u2019s going on under the hood. And that\u2019s what we seek to do.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah. That\u2019s really exciting. So I would imagine at the timeframe you\u2019re coming into it, one of the hot topics must have been ICOs, initial coin offerings.\n\nLewis:\n\nYep.\n\nIan:\n\nAnd my experience, and I\u2019ve only been in the space about two and a half years, so I only lived that period, 2017, 2018, through headlines that I wasn\u2019t really following. But my sense of it is that in some ways the challenges we\u2019re having between the industry and the SEC are a little bit reflecting back on that period of the ICO boom. When I look at an ICO, I have a hard time not seeing it as being equivalent to a private tech company doing an initial private investor round, where, in that case you create documents often called a safe, and you have a bunch of accredited investors who put some money into that initial seed, startup capital pool, to help a group of folks with a good idea get off the ground. ICO, to me, functionally looks the same. Would you agree with that?\n\nLewis:\n\n100%.\n\nLewis:\n\nYeah, 100%.\n\nIan:\n\nOkay.\n\nLewis:\n\nThis is really, it\u2019s a great, it\u2019s a very insightful question, because it\u2019s really where a lot of our confusion stems from. The prior chair of the SEC, Jay Clayton made a statement that, \u201cEvery ICO I\u2019ve seen looks like a securities transaction.\u201d I\u2019d broadly agree with that. It sounds like you would as well.\n\nIan:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nLewis:\n\nIf we can take just a slight step back, and talk about our securities laws and what the principles are, because I think it\u2019s when you know what the principles are, it\u2019s a lot easier to fit things into the framework. Obviously, prior to the stock market crash in 1929, and the depression that followed, we didn\u2019t have federal regulation of securities. So like many other things, including barbershops, and money transmission, and a whole range of things, they were regulated at the state level. Each state could make its own securities laws and it regulated activity in the state in its own way. And those are commonly referred to as blue sky laws. You could sell anything but the blue sky, kind of thing.\n\nObviously, after the market crash, and people looked around and said, \u201cWell, these are national markets, and they\u2019re really important to our entire economy in the United States. We need federal regulation.\u201d Fair enough. So Congress went ahead and drafted federal regulation. But if you\u2019re going to regulate securities activity, what\u2019s a security? \u2026 \u201cWell, what are we regulating here?\u201d So some things were obvious. Well, if you\u2019re selling shares of stock in a company or corporation, that\u2019s the security. That\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking of. Good to go. If you\u2019re selling notes, or bonds, or debentures that are widely traded as an investment, those are securities. And so what Congress did is they enumerated various things. \u201cOkay, we would all agree, here. That\u2019s a security. Check. That\u2019s a security. Check.\u201d\n\nAnd they went through about, give or take 10 or 12 different categories. But Congress back then, they\u2019re just as smart as we are today. Maybe not smarter, maybe not less smart. I said, \u201cPeople are people and they\u2019re always going to find workarounds. So if we just define securities as things with certain types of names or categories, stock, bond, note, debenture, things like that, people are going to just, \u2018Well, you know, Ian, I\u2019m not going to sell you a stock, I\u2019m going to sell you schmuck.\u2019 Different, totally different. So we\u2019re good to go, here.\u201d\n\nSo Congress borrowed from state law this idea that there were arrangements called investment contracts, which didn\u2019t necessarily fit into any of the other categories. But it\u2019s a you know it when you see it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re driving at, here. That should be regulated. And so they stuck in that term. And rather unfortunately or maybe fortunately, they didn\u2019t define the term investment contract because it was used commonly in state law, they incorporated into federal law. It didn\u2019t define it. And so nobody quite knew what it meant. And so it took about another, give or take 10 years, for the Supreme Court to get around to saying, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s what we think you, Congress, meant when you use that term. We think it means an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profit primarily from the efforts of others.\u201d\n\nThey originally said solely, but people realized solely, that\u2019s not quite right, primarily, for our purposes primarily. So when those factors are present, and here\u2019s really the important part again, a transaction will be considered a securities transaction. When we relate to each other in some way, and those factors are present, the law will \u2026 Even though you\u2019re not calling it a securities transaction, I\u2019m not calling it a securities transaction, if I\u2019m investing in money in you, we have a common enterprise in some way. We\u2019re both in it together. You\u2019re not walking away and I never see you again. I have an expectation of profit. I\u2019m not just buying some piece of art from you. I\u2019m doing this to make money. And I\u2019m expecting you to drive that forward. When those factors are present, we\u2019re going to say, \u201cThat\u2019s a securities transaction.\u201d\n\nThat may be fine, and this really ties back into where your question started, if we are both sophisticated people who, I can make an investment in you, I\u2019m what\u2019s considered an accredited investor, you give me whatever information I need, and then we make that decision. You haven\u2019t done a public offering of that. You\u2019ve just talked to me. It\u2019s a securities transaction, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s exempt, no registration is required.\n\nThe problem we saw in the ICO period is people were doing exactly that, but they were not doing it on a private basis. They\u2019re putting it up on a website, you probably remember this, with a countdown clock and every bad thing you can pretty much do, \u201cHurry up and buy,\u201d not a lot of information, what information is inaccurate? Sometimes they had pictures of God knows who on the website as you probably remember. And the whole thing was just absurd and ridiculous. So they were absolutely fundraising transactions because the people buying the tokens in those ICO transactions, they didn\u2019t really want to use the token for whatever, a sensible purpose. In many cases, the protocol wasn\u2019t even built. There was nothing you could use them for. What they wanted was to experience a profit based on whoever was the team, \u201cOh, look at this guy. It\u2019s Prince Charles or whatever,\u201d some absurd things they put up, and they wanted to make a profit. And so those were securities transactions. There were no exemptions. They were done publicly. There were no exemptions, and they were in violation of the law.\n\nAnd so we saw the SEC appropriately come down on those like a ton of bricks, and mostly that got stopped, but I\u2019m going to pause for breath, here, but that is where our problems kind of started, because you\u2019re 100% right. Those fundraising transactions do, I think quite clearly fall within the scope of our federal securities laws, and are regulated, and either need to be exempt, appropriately exempt or registered with the SEC.\n\nIan:\n\nAnd I think I want to pick up on something that you said, there, where you\u2019re using the term the transaction, is a securities transaction. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the business is now a securities business or that something that the entity has created, the token in this case, is in and of itself a security. Am I thinking about that-\n\nLewis:\n\nYou\u2019re thinking about-\n\nIan:\n\n\u2026 reading too much into your commentary?\n\nLewis:\n\nYeah, no, you\u2019re thinking about that 100% correct. And the judge really zeroes in on that, in that she focuses on the fact that the fact that you can sell something in a fundraising scheme does not make that thing itself a security. And it could be the most basic of commodities. The fact that there\u2019s a commodity involved does not mean that the asset being sold, or what she refers to as the subject \u2026 Here, I was looking for a quote to give you. So she says, \u201cBut the subject of a contract transaction or scheme is not necessarily a security on its face. Could be, but it\u2019s not necessarily.\u201d She goes on to say that, \u201cThis Howey case and the cases that followed have held that a variety of tangible and intangible assets can serve as the subject of an investment contract.\u201d And she gives some various examples. In each of these cases, the subject, which is the term you use, basically, of the investment contract was a standalone commodity, which is not in itself inherently an investment contract.\n\nAnd so that\u2019s really the key thing you have to examine, \u201cSo is there a scheme in which case that is substituting, it\u2019s a disguise? I could have pitched it as an investment scheme where we were selling securities, but I obfuscated, I tried to trick you into thinking, \u2018Nah, you\u2019re not really that kind of thing.\u2019 And I\u2019m giving you something that you don\u2019t want or need on its own. You just want to resell it later.\u201d That should be covered by the securities laws, but the judge in the XRP case says, \u201cWhen the transaction doesn\u2019t meet the four prongs of Howey, you could sell the exact same thing.\u201d And then this, I think, goes to what a lot of people is like, \u201cHang on, you\u2019re protecting the institutional investors. You\u2019re not protecting the retail investors.\u201d We\u2019ll talk about that. But that\u2019s not her point. Her point is simply this, that you have to look at a particular transaction, not at the asset, unless the asset itself is a security.\n\nIan:\n\nWell, and this is where I think a lot of people on Twitter suddenly start talking about oranges.\n\nLewis:\n\nExactly.\n\nIan:\n\nAnd they\u2019re like, \u201cOranges aren\u2019t securities, even though you could invest in an orange grove and that could be a securities transaction.\u201d I\u2019m finally understanding why everyone\u2019s been talking about oranges for the last few months.\n\nLewis:\n\nWell, the catch I\u2019d say, Ian, and this a little bit gets up my nose. People use this as a simplistic way of explaining it, and that\u2019s fine, \u201cOranges are not securities.\u201d\n\nIan:\n\nYeah.\n\nLewis:\n\nBut tokens are also not oranges. So I think it sells us short by underselling the argument in the other direction. You know, oranges are made-\n\nIan:\n\nYeah.\n\nLewis:\n\n\u2026 by the good Lord upstairs. They\u2019re in unlimited supply, and they\u2019ve always been around, and you can find them in a lot of places. Tokens are made by, typically, one person deploying a smart contract on a network like Ethereum, and they\u2019re in finite supply, and they\u2019re specifically designed that when you apply demand, the price goes up. That\u2019s not how oranges work. So they have very, very, very different characteristics. So I think in fairness, I wish people would stop saying, \u201cOranges are not securities.\u201d Not because it\u2019s not true, but it doesn\u2019t get at the core issue. That doesn\u2019t make tokens themselves securities, but it misleads, I think, the honest listener.\n\nIan:\n\nThat\u2019s a great point. And I would actually like to chase that a little bit because then I think ICOs, clearly securities transactions, but I felt like you were going to lead us down the path of saying, \u201cEven though you can have these security transactions, it doesn\u2019t in any way influence a later decision about are any given crypto tokens, whether there was an ICO or not, a security?\u201d But I feel like your last comment there is saying, \u201cWell, in some cases it is a security and it\u2019s not.\u201d Can you give us maybe a framework that\u2019s a little more sophisticated than the oranges that we can use to just reasonably apply as we\u2019re navigating through the ecosystem?\n\nLewis:\n\nOf course. Well, if we start with the base case. And for better or for worse, XRP is pretty good as a base case. But for the most part, Ether is not too far away. You have to look at the asset itself and the arrangement that it represents. So things that, particularly, in the early days, were characterized as utility tokens, which is not a term at all that I like, and you may have heard that term, but things that we\u2019re \u2026 First and foremost, let\u2019s just recall, the token itself is really just a number. What does it mean when you own, whether it\u2019s Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, or anything else, is that you have knowledge of a private key which allows you to give an instruction to a network of computers and tells it to do something. So that\u2019s first and foremost.\n\nSo is there anything that\u2019s associated with that number that gives you rights or benefits against some identifiable group? And for most tokens, if you look at the CoinMarketCap, 50, or maybe even 100, or CoinGecko, we\u2019re appropriate these days to say, when you look at that group, most of the tokens, holding aside stablecoins or Memecoins, do not provide any particular rights or benefits. But other coins do. Other coins have economics baked into them. For example, they may have a fee switch turned on. There may be a sharing, there may be a DAO that\u2019s created in that if you own the token, the DAO periodically does a buy and burn on those tokens.\n\nNow you have a very different sort of arrangement. If the DAO is seeking to run a business that would otherwise just look like a normal business except it\u2019s completely decentralized, then you say to yourself, \u201cWell, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s necessarily a security, but you have to look at it. Where the danger zone, I would say for folks predicting the DAO community are, is, is this really something managed by the community at large? And we can use the word decentralization. Interestingly, that word does not come up but once in the Ripple decision, that\u2019s a very interesting thing, because people have been obsessed around this. But we can come back to that.\n\nBut when you think about DAOs, is it something where everybody\u2019s really collectively deciding? And there are communities that are like that, where there\u2019s really meaningful community engagement, but there are plenty of communities where it\u2019s really a small number of folks who are driving the bus, and everybody else is along for the ride. Those are communities. If you\u2019ve got real economics, you\u2019re running a business, and there\u2019s a small number of people or companies that are functionally making all the decisions and everyone\u2019s relying on, now you have a different sort of arrangement.\n\nSo as a framework, ask yourself, \u201cWhat is the token doing? And am I in part of an actively managed business?\u201d XRP is not an actively \u2026 It\u2019s just like you use it, you send it to somebody, they send it back to you, like Bitcoin. Doesn\u2019t really do a lot. Even the Ether token itself is not, in and of itself a business or a venture, but other things are. So you think of more sophisticated products like Curve and Yearn or other things like that, that do, those are rate setting, that people are actively sitting there and managing the process. That\u2019s a different thing. And so I would absolutely urge caution to your listeners again to make sure, I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate from Judge Torres\u2019 decision in Ripple Labs that any token you do, you\u2019re good to go.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah, that seemed to be the internet\u2019s reaction as soon as the ruling came out was, \u201cOkay, everything now, not a security. Great. We\u2019re in the clear, let\u2019s go wild.\u201d Decentralization has always been to me a bit of a red herring. I appreciate the idea of community driven action in the same way that I\u2019m fascinated by things that happen on Kickstarter, but it doesn\u2019t seem like decentralization in and of itself really has anything to do with securities law, but it\u2019s been built up in the ecosystem as a shield, almost, that says, \u201cWell, no, we\u2019re decentralized, therefore securities laws don\u2019t apply.\u201d And I\u2019ve never understood that logic. Could you maybe strawman the case on both sides of this argument for us?\n\nLewis:\n\nAbsolutely, and it\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s really a fundamental question. And look, decentralization is critically important, as you say, for a lot of different reasons, just for the ethos of the crypto ecosystem and many other things. So it\u2019s certainly a very important concept. I think in fairness to community members, this really got its start when someone at the SEC, this gentleman, Bill Hinman, who was at the time in a very senior staff role as the director of the division of corporation finance, gave a speech, and this has now become a famous speech when Howey met Gary (Plastic), which was a case. And in that, Director Hinman was seeking to address a challenging issue in the community back in, I think that was in 2018 or \u201919, I can\u2019t even recall at this point. He was, \u201cWell, what is the status of Ether?\u201d\n\nAnd Director Hinman didn\u2019t want to say, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see, here, nothing to worry about,\u201d because basically Ether was sold and functionally in a crowd sale. So he didn\u2019t want to say that, but he didn\u2019t want to also get people all alarmed that the Ether token was a security. And so he came up with this term, \u201cRight now, I see the Ether ecosystem as sufficiently decentralized.\u201d And so people extrapolated from that. \u201cOh, I get it. If you\u2019re sufficiently decentralized, then you\u2019re okay. If you\u2019re not sufficiently decentralized, might have a problem.\u201d\n\nAnd I think they took the wrong lesson away. The lesson is less about whether the ecosystem is decentralized, it\u2019s what is the nature of the transaction? And I think in the article, which you may have in your show notes, Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law, we say, \u201cLook, you have to ask yourself what is the nature of the token itself?\u201d So if you are fundraising with the token, whether that\u2019s because you\u2019re the Ethereum Foundation or an initial person who received a big boatload of Ether tokens, if you are fundraising for a business and saying to people, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to drive this thing.\u201d That\u2019s going to be problematic.\n\nThe overlap with sufficient decentralization is it\u2019s like the inverse of reliance on the efforts of others. The idea would be, \u201cWell, if the community is so sufficiently decentralized that you\u2019re not relying on anyone, then you can\u2019t rely on a given seller, because by definition you\u2019re not relying on anyone.\u201d So it\u2019s more like you\u2019re looking at the same thing from the other side and say, \u201cHey, if no one is driving the bus, then I could buy from anyone and not think that I\u2019m relying upon them.\u201d But the key question, it\u2019s not the inverse part, it\u2019s the form of it. It\u2019s like, \u201cIs it reasonable to expect that you\u2019re relying on someone?\u201d And so for example, even with Bitcoin, we\u2019ve seen investment contract transactions where people said, \u201cSomehow or another they convinced them, like BitConnect, you\u2019re going to do some crazy scheme with Bitcoin.\u201d It\u2019s not that Bitcoin isn\u2019t decentralized, it\u2019s people pitched the purchase based on something they\u2019re going to do. So the key thing from a legal point of view is not so much the decentralization. That\u2019s the absence, it\u2019s the way cold is the absence of heat. It\u2019s the same kind of concept, there.\n\nIan:\n\nOne of the things that I\u2019ve had explained to me related to decentralization is that you could have something start as a centralized project, which I think almost everything I\u2019ve observed in crypto actually does.\n\nLewis:\n\nYeah.\n\nIan:\n\nRight?\n\nLewis:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIan:\n\nIt\u2019s you and I get together and we say, \u201cYou know what would be awesome? If we applied an automated market maker, lending pools, we come up in and lose Crypto Emporium, and we launch. And then over time \u2026 \u201d So at the beginning, clearly, there\u2019s an enterprise, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go seek people to invest in our efforts. We\u2019ll build this up.\u201d But it\u2019s some point in the future we could say, \u201cYou know what? There\u2019s now a huge community of enthusiasts who are participating. There\u2019s lots of great people with good ideas. We\u2019ve written the technical architecture in such a way that other people can build on it regardless of what you and I think.\u201d And at that point, it crosses into this realm of decentralization. And so at some point it definitely was a common enterprise and then it is no longer, and that somehow has an impact on the securities treatment of both transactions and the enterprise itself. Is that realistic or practical in-\n\nLewis:\n\nI\u2019d say-\n\nIan:\n\n\u2026 any way?\n\nLewis:\n\n\u2026 it a little differently. And I think again, Judge Torres did a amazing job in her opinion. The transactions between third parties who might be, you and me, our friend Jane starts a protocol with six of her buddies and she\u2019s in the process of trying to decentralize. And each month that goes by Jane and her colleagues are a little bit less relevant, but it\u2019s hard to say, \u201cHave they really decentralized?\u201d Hard to know, right?\n\nIan:\n\nYeah.\n\nLewis:\n\nBut then somewhere along the way, maybe she airdrops some tokens and they\u2019re trading around. And you and I, who have nothing to do with Jane, we\u2019ve never met her, don\u2019t know her, never had any conversations with her, vaguest idea. Is she even living? I don\u2019t know, maybe something terrible happened. We don\u2019t know. You and I trade that token that Jane was the developer of and the centralized party, we don\u2019t know the status of her scheme.\n\nBetween the two of us, we are not engaged in a securities transaction whether or not Jane is still driving the bus on that project, because between the two of us, we\u2019re just trading something with each other. The critical thing that the SEC has tried to argue is that if Jane is driving the bus, then when we trade with each other, we are engaged in a securities transaction. The importance of that is that let\u2019s say you are in the business, you\u2019ve got a couple of different things going on over there, Ian, besides an amazing podcast. You\u2019ve got a whole sneaker business. And you would, just like early on in Kicks, and you got all kinds of vintage \u2026 And you\u2019re a dealer in sneakers. You make a market, you\u2019ll buy them, you\u2019ll sell them. You have a big inventory of sneakers in the back behind the nice artwork you got, there. So you\u2019re a dealer in sneakers.\n\nAnd then, also, somewhere along the way you became a dealer in tokens, same deal. You buy them, you sell them, and you have an inventory of them. When you deal in sneakers, you\u2019re not engaging in securities transactions. The SEC wants to say, \u201cWow, hang on a second there, fella. When you\u2019re dealing in tokens, you need to figure out if Jane\u2019s scheme is ongoing and it\u2019s relying on her or not.\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t know Jane. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Maybe she went and she\u2019s on a long vacation. Maybe she just stopped. She got bored. I don\u2019t know. Maybe she\u2019s really actively involved. I do not know, and I cannot assess that. I cannot know whether, when I sell a token to Lewis as a dealer, I need to register as a broker dealer. I can\u2019t make that assessment in the same way that I\u2019m selling sneakers here.\u201d\n\nNow, this is different. Let\u2019s say Jane comes to you with some of her tokens. \u201cIan, you seem to know a lot of people. How about I give you a bunch of my tokens, you sell them for me.\u201d Very different set of facts. You are now distributing them. So are you an independent third party, unaffiliated? You\u2019re just buying and selling tokens. Judge Torres recognizes that. And so she says, \u201cIt\u2019s not relevant whether Jane\u2019s scheme is decentralized or not decentralized when you and I trade in that token with each other, because you have strict liability. If you were dealing in securities, you would need to register with the SEC as a broker dealer and comply with a whole raft of regulations.\u201d And they\u2019re appropriate regulations. Nobody\u2019s beefing about the regulations. But you need to know. So if you\u2019re dealing in shares of stock, oh, you better talk to a lawyer because, man, you need to register.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah.\n\nLewis:\n\nHow do you know which tokens require you to register with the SEC and which do not? How do you make that assessment? That is the beef, really, that we\u2019ve heard from the crypto community from day one, not about Jane. When Jane sells those tokens she would need to register those fundraising transactions until people do not rely on Jane. And that day might come. She\u2019s got a big community and she happens to still be holding some tokens, but when people buy from her, they\u2019re no longer relying on her or her company. At that point. Decentralization matters a lot, because they\u2019re buying from her.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t about the decentralization. It\u2019s the, \u201cIs it reasonable to rely on her?\u201d If there\u2019s a big community and a lot of people are doing a lot of stuff, then you might say, \u201cIt\u2019s not reasonable to rely on what Jane is doing.\u201d The question isn\u2019t decentralization. The question is reliance on the efforts of others. That\u2019s the Howey question. Decentralization is a way of saying, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to rely on Jane anymore because you don\u2019t have to rely on anybody.\u201d But when you and I trade, when coins are on a marketplace, Bittrex, Gemini, Binance, you name it, nobody knows whether that project is sufficiently decentralized, nor can they determine that. That\u2019s the critical difference. Hopefully that \u2026\n\nIan:\n\nThis is super helpful groundwork. So let\u2019s jump into Ripple. This lawsuit\u2019s been ongoing. I think SEC initially filed against Ripple way back in 2020 before the world shut down for the pandemic. Maybe start with a quick summary of what the SEC\u2019s complaint against Ripple was, and then we can jump into the recent ruling from the judge.\n\nLewis:\n\nRipple had already had a brush with the law four years earlier or something around being a money transmitter. And so they went through this whole thing about whether, through their use of the XRP token, they needed to register, and they did. They eventually settled and they became a money transmitter, and they did all of that. Fine. They kept, because they generated this large amount of XRP tokens, and because a lot of people thought that it was a good product, and it would become successful, they bought it on a speculative basis. And so they said, \u201cI got a feeling that people are going to use, this is going to be a great solution.\u201d And maybe they\u2019re right, maybe they\u2019re wrong, not our point. People started buying it speculatively, that\u2019s fine. People buy a lot of things speculatively.\n\nAnd then Ripple. So then they said, \u201cWell, a lot of people buying this speculatively. I thought I could raise money to keep driving forward my business by selling these tokens.\u201d And so they sold quite a mod. I think it\u2019s well over one and a half billion dollars worth of Ripple, I think is alleged, about 700 and 700 give or take between the institutional sales and the programmatic sales, give or take. And so the SEC looks at this, \u201cWell, hold on a second, here, guys. Aren\u2019t you the prime candidate of what we\u2019re trying to stop, here? People are funding your business. And they\u2019re doing so in a way that either is not exempt from the registration requirements in these transactions or providing the adequate disclosures. You are the poster child of what\u2019s going wrong with this whole thing.\u201d\n\nAnd so the SEC, after presuming a long time of discussion and engagement decides, \u201cWe\u2019re going to sue you and we\u2019re going to allege that when you fundraised by selling your tokens, you violated the law. So that gave rise to this thing. Ironically enough, the lawsuit was, I think, on the next last day of Jay Clayton\u2019s term as chair. And the Gensler, SEC inherited that and continue to move forward. But I think we can all readily understand where the beef was with Ripple Labs, and said, \u201cLook, you\u2019re raising a lot of money, here. Feels like,\u201d just like you said, Ian, \u201cthat this feels like a tech company raising money, and yet you\u2019re not making sure that you\u2019re exempt, nor are you registering with the SEC. You got to pick one channel, guys, and you didn\u2019t pick either. And so that\u2019s our beef with you.\u201d\n\nNow, clearly, I think part of it was also thinking that this was going to be an easy case to win, and therefore having won that case, they were going to go on and then knock over some more bowling pins down the line. But that was the gist of the beef. And I think for many people we thought, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a beef there, there\u2019s a beef to be had.\u201d\n\nIan:\n\nYeah. And why did Ripple, and obviously you\u2019re not representing Ripple, so speculation, here, not insider advice, but what is your assessment of why Ripple chose to argue against that case? Because that seems incredibly straightforward and something that I would say, \u201cWell, gosh, we should probably settle and not do that again.\u201d That would be my layperson\u2019s assessment of the situation. But they clearly didn\u2019t do that. They\u2019ve been fighting this to great expense for now over three years and it\u2019s ongoing.\n\nLewis:\n\nAbsolutely, and I\u2019m glad you just reminded me because it should be either at the top or the bottom of the show. But as with every podcast I do, there\u2019s no legal advice here. I\u2019m not your lawyer. Get your own. So just to be very clear, no legal advice for anybody, here. These are just my own opinions and not those of anyone else\u2019s. In terms of why Ripple apps choose to sue, there\u2019s a lot at stake for them. The potential liability, it was quite large, and I think they felt genuinely that they had arguments to be made, and they wanted to assert those arguments.\n\nAnd I think just as the SEC as an enforcement authority is every right to bring claims and actions that they, let\u2019s assume in good faith feel are violating the law, people who are accused of violating the law have every right to defend themselves. And in this case, and I can\u2019t, and I don\u2019t want to speculate exactly why they didn\u2019t settle, but this is very large situation, and they felt they had good grounds to win. They retained some amazing law firms to represent them, and they said, \u201cLook, let\u2019s just go at it.\u201d And sometimes you got to just throw it down and see what happens.\n\nIan:\n\nWell, and it seems like the strategy has paid off in their favor, at least to some degree. So unpack for us what Judge Torres\u2019 ruling said, because I personally found it very confusing. She made two big statements, but walk us through what that was.\n\nLewis:\n\nSure. I think it really confused a lot of people. You\u2019re far from being alone. And I think it was confusing both in terms of what she just practically said and then also confusing what the policy was. I think both of those flummoxed a lot of people. And you see a lot of internet chatter, \u201cShe got it exactly backwards,\u201d a lot of different things. So let\u2019s first talk about what she actually said. She broke down the transactions as the SEC put them forward into these, broadly speaking, three categories, the institutional sales, the programmatic sales, and what she refers as the other distributions. There were also some sales by the individual defendants, Garlinghouse and Larsen, we can talk about those at the very end.\n\nSo for the institutional sales, they fit, and the judge analyzed each of those separately as transactions. She\u2019d never analyzed the XRP token after having concluded that it did not in and of itself embody a contract transaction or scheme for purposes of Howey. She says, \u201cThe token\u2019s not the thing. We need to look at the transactions.\u201d And so with the institutional transactions, people came in the front door, negotiated with Ripple Labs, Ripple Labs made direct undertakings to those persons, and said, \u201cHey, if you give me money, look at all the different things we\u2019re going to do. This is really going to work out.\u201d They commingled the monies that various purchasers had, so there\u2019s a common enterprise through commingling what, in technical terms we call horizontal commonality.\n\nAnd she said, \u201cClearly, the people buying the tokens, were not buying them like sneakers because they\u2019re going to wear them, they were buying them in bulk so that they could resell them later at a profit.\u201d So all of those elements were present. She does, \u201cIt\u2019s really down the middle. Howey, boom. Did you register? Oh, you didn\u2019t? Sorry, that\u2019s a violation of the law. So you offered securities in the form of these transactions. You did not register with the SEC. Game over. You\u2019re responsible.\u201d However, that\u2019s the less interesting part of her decision.\n\nThe second part obviously relates to the programmatic sales. And when it comes to programmatic sales, what XRP was doing was dribbling out small amounts of XRP in various marketplaces, and that there\u2019s a critical thing, and I think this, as you said, Ian, earlier, was something that the internet had missed. She focused on the fact that there was a vibrant and active secondary market for XRP. At the time that this was going on, XRP was more or less the fourth largest traded token in the marketplace. There were a lot, a lot of people just trading with each other for whatever reason. We might think, \u201cMan, what are you thinking over there, XRP trading people?\u201d Fair enough. That\u2019s not the point. They\u2019re trading with each other. There\u2019s a vibrant market for that. People are selling their supreme Kicks and doing all whatever, good idea, bad idea, not the point. They\u2019re trading with each other.\n\nWhat the judge concludes is, \u201cWell, let\u2019s look at the transactions in which XRP is selling them. They\u2019re on a blind bid-ask basis. They\u2019re just mixed into the flow of the other transactions that are already occurring.\u201d When people bought or sold, but particularly here, bought the XRP tokens, they don\u2019t know are they buying from Ian Andrews? Are they buying from Lewis Cohen? Are they buying from Ripple Labs the company? They don\u2019t know, nor do they care. Nobody\u2019s making representations to them. They\u2019re not coming in, sitting down, engaging. There are none of the elements that are present in a Howey scheme, and therefore those transactions are not non-investment contract transactions.\n\nSo that\u2019s what she says. As to the other distributions, that\u2019s the area where I think many of us feel that she perhaps overshot the mark a little bit. So in the other distributions and your, I\u2019m sure, community of viewers are aware, many, many projects use their tokens to remunerate their employees, sometimes contractors. And she says, \u201cWell, they\u2019re not putting capital into the business, so therefore no investment of money, therefore no investment contract transaction.\u201d That\u2019s a little \u2026 I don\u2019t know about that. I think most of us would say, \u201cWe don\u2019t know about that.\u201d\n\nIan:\n\nThat\u2019s a head scratch to me because-\n\nLewis:\n\nThat\u2019s a head-\n\nIan:\n\n\u2026 because-\n\nLewis:\n\nI think that\u2019s-\n\nIan:\n\nAs an employee of tech companies my entire career, my labor in exchange for equity via stock options in the business, again, just like-\n\nLewis:\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a fancy lawyer.\n\nIan:\n\n\u2026 my ICO comment earlier.\n\nLewis:\n\nYeah, you don\u2019t have to be a fancy lawyer. And again, of course when you get stock options, you\u2019re getting a security, right, because the stock is a security.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah.\n\nLewis:\n\nThe problem with the XRP token, it\u2019s not a security, but you\u2019re bartering. Her argument is that, \u201cYou\u2019re not making an investment of money, but you\u2019re bartering,\u201d right? So for example-\n\nIan:\n\nYeah.\n\nLewis:\n\nYou could imagine that you might have said, let\u2019s just be optimistic, here, and said, \u201cWell, I would\u2019ve gotten $300,000 a year in cash, but if you give me tokens, I\u2019ll do a $100,000 a year. Or just give me the money. Boom, fine.\u201d\n\nIan:\n\nYeah.\n\nLewis:\n\nYou\u2019re bartering $200,000 of value for tokens. That\u2019s really no different than you\u2019re getting $300,000 of cash and then using $200,000 to buy the tokens. There\u2019s no economic difference in that whatsoever. So I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m right there with you, Ian. I\u2019m not sure I got anything to say about that.\n\nIan:\n\nThe second piece that you talked about there, these programmatic sales, it seems like the industry impact on that ruling is going to be most directly felt by exchanges and one of the charges against them, I believe, is operating as an unregistered broker dealer for facilitating securities transactions via all these tokens. Does the ruling in the Ripple case ultimately cited as some precedent law in that case?\n\nLewis:\n\nWell, I\u2019m going to take the question just a little bit more broadly and say there are three allegations that are core allegations in three different lawsuits all filed around the same time. And all three are basically the same. Number one, exactly as you said, you\u2019re acting as an unregistered broker dealer. So as we talked about before with the sneaker example, you\u2019re acting as a market as a national securities exchange, which is different. So the broker dealer, you\u2019re just offering to buy and sell in a exchange. You\u2019re creating prices and creating a marketplace for bids, and asks, and prices. So that\u2019s the second type of violation. And then there\u2019s third, you\u2019re acting as a clearing agent, meaning you\u2019re settling trades. So you\u2019re taking the cash from one buyer, the securities of another buyer, and crossing them to effect that all of those are three different but regulated activities.\n\nAnd the SEC accuses all three of those entities of all three of those violations. All of those violations turn on what they are actually trading in, not being securities, excuse me, not being sneakers, but being securities. And so Judge Torres\u2019 analysis here is absolutely central, just like you said, for all three of those cases. And also, potentially for Uniswap, for example, which effectively facilitates very similar activity. And she says, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not so much when two third parties are buying and selling, absent other facts. Those are not securities transactions. They\u2019re securities transactions when someone \u2026 \u201c\n\nAnd again, for example, in my case of the tokens and Jane, I think, our heroine in our story, if she comes to you and asks you to distribute the tokens for her, that could well put you in the position of acting as her agent, in effect, on her behalf and selling those securities. And in the absence of there being a vibrant market, if the purchasers, for example, in a initial DEX offering or an initial exchange offering like a launchpad type situation, where there is no vibrant market, and basically everybody\u2019s buying the token based on the only thing you have out there is not a market of buyers and sellers, but simply a project that\u2019s saying, \u201cHey, buy this because its numbers going to go up.\u201d I think you get a very different result.\n\nSo her decision really helps as to tokens that are already out there in trading. You had asked earlier about, \u201cWell, how do you on ramp?\u201d And that is, in many ways, the big question. And one of the bills in Congress, the House Market Structure Bill, attempts to address that by creating a on ramp way of allowing people to distribute tokens without necessarily violating the law, but in a practical way of doing that.\n\nIan:\n\nInteresting. We won\u2019t use the three that are actually in lawsuits, maybe, so we\u2019re a little freer to speculate, here, but theoretical exchange collaborates with a new project. They want to distribute a token. The exchange has a bunch of existing customers who like to buy tokens for whatever reason, and they say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to onboard token X, the new token of the day.\u201d And they put out an email to all their customers, they advertise over Twitter, and draw a bunch of people in who buy token X. That\u2019s going to get you in trouble.\n\nLewis:\n\nYeah, it is potentially going to get you into trouble, potentially. Right?\n\nIan:\n\nYeah. Okay.\n\nLewis:\n\nAnd that\u2019s where, and I have to say, I hadn\u2019t used the whole cold as the absence of heat thing, but now I\u2019m liking it. That\u2019s why I love doing podcasts. You always come up with something new and different. That\u2019s where decentralizations really becomes important. Right?\n\nIan:\n\nOkay.\n\nLewis:\n\nIt\u2019s not so much is the project, when you do that to decentralized? It\u2019s is it reasonable to expect that the people buying on your exchange are relying on the efforts of that project? So if you\u2019re not decentralized, then there\u2019s a good chance that it is reasonable for them if you\u2019re the main distributor of the token, and it\u2019s not decentralized, that is, Jane\u2019s really driving the bus, man, is she brilliant. MIT, that girl\u2019s crazy. People are going to be relying on that. It\u2019s not so much per se that you\u2019re distributing the tokens, is, is it reasonable to rely on the efforts of others?\n\nAnd again, in the case of Ripple, Judge Torres is looking at this and there\u2019s a lot of people trading this stuff, they don\u2019t know or care where it\u2019s coming from. In the DEX offering or the exchange offering that you hypothesize, it\u2019s probably quite likely, and in fact, in many cases, the exchange is actually disseminating the white paper and various things, and really facilitating that reliance. If you are facilitating the reliance on Jane, and Jane Labs, and that sort of thing, then you really are running a real risk, there, yes. So it really depends on what that relationship is, what are you trading, and where does it stand?\n\nIan:\n\nYeah, that\u2019s very helpful. And it seems like there\u2019s a slightly different scenario where there\u2019s a token that\u2019s already popular by its own right. It\u2019s in the market. There\u2019s lots of people that hold the token, they trade it frequently. And my theoretical exchange says, \u201cWell, gosh, we want to facilitate some of these transactions, because we collect a fee on every one, and that\u2019ll make us some money.\u201d And we do the same marketing. We send out an email to all our customers and we advertise on Twitter and we say, \u201cToken X is now available for trading on our platform.\u201d That seems like it keeps me out of trouble.\n\nLewis:\n\nWell, again, Judge Torres specifically doesn\u2019t rule on that, right? She has a footnote-\n\nIan:\n\nOkay.\n\nLewis:\n\n\u2026 16, and she\u2019s not getting into the direct secondary sales. I think that\u2019s an area where, if you\u2019re running an exchange, you need to think long and hard about it. Do you feel comfortable that you are really sufficiently distant from anything going on, that you\u2019re not promoting the scheme, you\u2019re just facilitating third party transactions. If you\u2019re comfortable that you\u2019re facilitating third party transactions, then that\u2019s a different set of circumstances. So decentralization is in the background, but really the question is, \u201cHow are you?\u201d So if you\u2019re going out there, and again, you could take the XRP as one end of the scale and maybe the launchpad as the other end of the scale. With the XRP token, she said, \u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t appear that people are relying in any way on the person selling. In the launchpad there is no market. You\u2019re facilitating distribution. It\u2019s not on your website. It\u2019s on the exchanges website. But it\u2019s the same thing. You probably have a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nIan:\n\nYeah.\n\nLewis:\n\n\u201cWhere in that thing that needs to be, everybody needs to \u2026 \u201d But it\u2019s not that the token, the core thing here, it\u2019s not that the token is a security. You\u2019ve got to ask yourself, \u201cAm I facilitating the distribution of an investment scheme?\u201d And that is a different kind of question.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah, it\u2019s very different than what I think most people are focused on right now, so I\u2019m glad we got into that discussion. The important thing in the Ripple case is it\u2019s not over. So this ruling is not the end of the case. Talk to us a little bit about, just from a process standpoint, what we should expect going forward now that this ruling\u2019s been issued.\n\nLewis:\n\nWell, that\u2019s absolutely right. We said there are these three categories of sales, the institutional sales, she rules on, the programmatic sales, she rules on, the other distributions, she rules on. And then the individual sales by Garlinghouse and Larsen are functionally the same as the programmatic sales, so she rules on. So that leaves just one little thing, and that is did Garlinghouse and Larsen aid and abet in their individual capacity, the company in their illegal sales? So we know that the institutional sales violated a law. Her question is, \u201cGarlinghouse and Larsen as executives, did they aid and abet that?\u201d That\u2019s a factual question. That\u2019s held back. And that needs a trial. So we don\u2019t have a final judgment because she hasn\u2019t resolved all the questions.\n\nWithout a final judgment. Neither Ripple nor the SEC can appeal this decision as a matter of right. They don\u2019t get to, like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to appeal it and I\u2019m out of here.\u201d Because there\u2019s no final judgment. That requires, and you\u2019ve probably heard this term already, what\u2019s called interlocutory appeal. That is, \u201cHey, hold on a second, pause the game because I\u2019m going to go to the replay booth and try and figure out what\u2019s going on over there. And then we\u2019ll come back and keep playing, because it\u2019s so important to the outcome of the game, we can\u2019t wait until the game\u2019s over to do the appeal. I got to figure it out now because that\u2019s going to affect everything.\u201d An interlocutory repeal depends on both the trial court judge, Judge Torres, granting that, and also the appellate court, in our case the second circuit, accepting it. So the SEC would have to ask, Judge Torres would have to grant, and the second circuit would have to grant.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, the SEC have not asked yet. So it\u2019s a moot point. They could ask. If they do, Judge Torres would have to agree, \u201cYes, this is so important, I\u2019m going to certify this for appeal.\u201d The second circuit would have to agree, and then we would pause the trial, and move on to the appeal. If they don\u2019t ask, or they\u2019re denied by either the two courts that could deny it, \u201cSo sorry.\u201d And then you\u2019ll continue with the trial. But of course, there\u2019s one more possibility. Mathematically they could settle with the two defendants.\n\nAt that point, all the issues are done and you don\u2019t need a trial because you\u2019ve settled, and then you have a final judgment. And then either side or both sides could appeal because Ripple lost, too. So they have an ability to appeal, or the SEC could appeal, or they both could appeal. So then in either way, the earliest I think anybody could see this getting resolved is probably about a year from now. And it could even be longer, depending on the trial and every which other thing. So it\u2019s going to be a while any way you slice it.\n\nIan:\n\nYeah. Well, I\u2019m going to get my popcorn, and keep watching, and I\u2019m going to follow you on Twitter because you get deep into all these topics as they\u2019re unfolding. Give us your Twitter handle-\n\nLewis:\n\nSure. It\u2019s-\n\nIan:\n\n\u2026 so that we can-\n\nLewis:\n\nIt\u2019s NY crypto lawyer. So N-Y, I won\u2019t spell crypto lawyer. You can hopefully figure it out. If you can\u2019t spell crypto lawyer, probably just best let it be.\n\nIan:\n\nThat\u2019s right. You don\u2019t need to follow.\n\nLewis:\n\nYou don\u2019t need to follow.\n\nIan:\n\nThat\u2019s okay.\n\nLewis:\n\nBecause I\u2019m following myself, man. I can\u2019t spell that stuff. So in any event, Ian, it\u2019s been so nice chatting with you. I\u2019m so psyched. You have got a great show. And I hope everybody\u2019s watching, not just this episode, but many more of the great episodes that you\u2019ve done.\n\nIan:\n\nLewis, thanks so much. I feel incredibly more informed than where I was this morning when we started. It\u2019s been terrific. Hope to have you back again soon as this and other cases progress, to unpack the-\n\nLewis:\n\nBe a pleasure."
