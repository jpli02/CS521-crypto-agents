        "content": "Three days before Christmas 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ripple, a company based in San Francisco that provides the infrastructure for cross-border payments, and two of its executives with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering by selling a cryptocurrency, XRP. The same day, Ripple announced it would \u201cfight.\u201d\n\nAfter more than two years of protracted legal conflict, all of the evidence has been heard, and there remains nothing left but for Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York to issue a verdict. Those with a stake in the outcome, which will reverberate throughout the crypto sector, have been attempting to divine when a judgment might land, based on the judge\u2019s past ruling patterns. Some believe a resolution is only days away.\n\nIn bringing the charges, the SEC has staked a claim to jurisdiction over cryptocurrency. At the center of the suit is the question over whether XRP, the crypto token on which Ripple\u2019s services are based, should be classified as a security\u2014a tradable financial instrument like a bond or derivative\u2014or something else entirely.\n\nIf the court rules that XRP is a security, it would follow that almost all other crypto tokens are too, making them subject to the SEC\u2019s supervision. Not only would this impose burdensome registration and reporting requirements on crypto firms, but it also may have legal consequences for entities that have issued tokens or helped people to trade them without SEC approval. Even large US-based exchanges may suddenly find themselves in the crosshairs.\n\nThat, says defense lawyer John Deaton, who supplied expert testimony on the case on behalf of holders of XRP, would be \u201cvery bad news\u201d for crypto businesses.\n\nIn the absence of legislation that makes clear the classification of crypto assets in the US, the question of whether they should be treated as securities has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis through the application of the Howey test. Under the test, an investment contract (in this context, a security) is defined as \u201can investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profits, to be derived from the efforts of others.\u201d"

        "title": "SVB Ripple Effects May Force Neobank Reckoning - PYMNTS.com",
        "content": "After the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank meltdowns, the First Republic bailout, the Credit Suisse rescue, what\u2019s to become of the neobanks?\n\nAt this writing, the issue of trust in financial institution is front and center in ways that have not been seen since 2008.\n\nAnd it may be a time of reckoning for the neobanks, the internet-only players that have ditched the physical branches in favor of a model that lets clients (whether they are consumers or enterprises) bank with their mobile phones and tablets.\n\nAt first glance, the enthusiasm to use digital-only banking options is firmly in place. As noted in the most recent edition of the \u201cDigital-First Banking Tracker,\u201d a collaboration between PYMNTS and NCR, consumers said they would switch banks for better technology capabilities. The appeal is especially strong among the younger generation. As many as 70% of millennials and Generation Z indicated that propensity to switch.\n\nThat was before the current crisis.\n\nWilling to Switch \u2014 Before the Crisis\n\nAs for the inroads that have been made by the digital-only players \u2014 well, the willingness to switch, as noted above, has yet to translate into significant market share. Only 9% of the consumers that we surveyed have lodged their primary accounts with digital-only banks.\n\nThe FinTechs are going to face a reckoning, as they have been burning through cash (and cash burn, as has been widely reported, forced at least some of the deposit drawdowns that would up sending SVB into a spiral). For neobanks, the initial flight of capital away from SVB has spurred inflows of deposits at firms like Brex. Startups, after all, have had to find new places to house their money.\n\nBut, over time, the same concerns that have dominated the banking industry these past few weeks will come to bear on digital players, especially if they are getting new accounts that are exceeding the $250,000 caps currently in place on insured deposits. The question of what to do with deposits over $250,000 \u2014 especially when it comes to business banking \u2014 will gain more urgency. In a recent interview with Karen Webster, Amias Gerety, partner at FinTech VC firm QED Investors, said that one approach by regulators would be to charge for deposit insurance, perhaps on a risk-adjusted framework \u2014 that function is already in place at the FDIC.\n\nAny increased costs on the FinTech models, which sprung up as entities that don\u2019t hold bank charters, but partner with smaller and regional bank stalwarts to hold deposits, would hit operating lines that are already awash in a sea of red ink. As reported here late last year, some players, such as Chime, have been cutting staff, as funding faces headwinds across the entire sector. And German consultant Simon Kucher and Partners estimated that less than 5% of neobanks globally had achieved break-even as of May 2022. There are some examples of profitability, as we reported, including Monzo.\n\nBut an additional PYMNTS study, this time with Treasury Prime, reveal that roughly 50% of consumers surveyed, as 2022 drew to a close, were not considering making a digital-only bank their key provider. In the study, 34% cited satisfaction with their current bank as the most important reason, 13% wanted to retain access to physical branches, 15% cited concern for the overall security of their money and information. Turns out that being able to \u201cset eyes\u201d on one\u2019s money is of value \u2014 and may be of particular competitive advantage for the traditional financial institutions that have digital capabilities but brick-and-mortar presence too."

        "title": "SEC vs. Ripple verdict could come at pivotal time for crypto industry - Fox Business",
        "content": "As commuters rush through the arrivals hall at Washington D.C.\u2018s iconic Union Station, they are greeted with a phalanx of fast-food restaurants, coffee vendors and the occasional retail store. Around 100,000 people pass through each day, many of them Wall Street types taking the Amtrak from New York City to do government business. Others are local commuters scrambling to work from the DC suburbs and, of course, tourists visiting the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nAmid the chaos looms a large blue billboard with bold white lettering bearing the words \"Crypto Means Business.\" Underneath reads the name of the billboard\u2019s sponsor: \"Ripple.\"\n\nRIPPLE CEO SAYS LANDMARK LAWSUIT WILL BE DECIDED BY A JUDGE\n\nTravelers disconnected from the crypto industry likely see the signage as just another corporate advertisement in a train station. Most probably don\u2019t know that Ripple is one of the biggest names in the crypto industry, the vendor of a cross-border payments solution that uses blockchain technology.\n\nThey also don\u2019t know that the ad\u2019s placement in Union Station is, in fact, quite symbolic. It\u2019s located on the exact route commuting securities lawyers take on their way to the headquarters of Wall Street\u2019s top cop, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, whose lobby is located just down the hall.\n\nFor nearly two years, the SEC has been locked in a high-profile lawsuit with Ripple and the outcome could dictate the scope of crypto enforcement proposed by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. The ad in Union Station is not just a way for the company to tout its product \u2014 it\u2019s also a clear message from Ripple to the SEC that it's not backing down.\n\nDISTRICT JUDGE CALLS OUT SEC FOR HYPOCRISY IN RIPPLE LAWSUIT\n\nAs FOX Business has previously reported, the SEC in 2020 filed charges alleging that Ripple and its executives violated securities laws by selling the digital token XRP to bankroll its business. The SEC contends Ripple should have registered XRP as a security. Ripple says XRP is not a security, thus the sales were totally legal.\n\nGensler, who became SEC chief in 2021, has aggressively pursued the civil litigation. People close to him say he\u2019s hoping that a legal victory will cement his status as crypto\u2019s chief regulator. More importantly for Gensler, it could give him carte blanche to declare just about every digital coin, except maybe bitcoin, an unregistered security as he seeks to reign in what he believes is rampant abuse and corruption in the $1 trillion industry.\n\nAs the case has dragged on through federal courts, the crypto business has been left in a regulatory void. Is the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator of futures contracts and currencies, its primary regulator? Are digital assets securities, commodities, currencies or something else entirely?\n\nThis legal quandary will soon draw to a close. According to lawyers working on the case, the federal district judge from Manhattan, Analisa Torres, could make a key ruling possibly in the coming days on so-called summary judgment, which could hand either Ripple or the SEC a victory. The judge could also order the case go to trial, which could delay the industry\u2019s much needed regulatory clarity for months, maybe even years.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson declined comment, as did a spokesperson for Ripple.\n\nREGULATORY RIDDLE: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SEC V. RIPPLE CASE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR CRYPTO\n\nIn recent months, Judge Torres has sided with Ripple on various motions, including its demands for emails and other documents from SEC officials in an effort to show the agency may have unfairly targeted Ripple. Those documents were also designed to show how the SEC may have failed to give Ripple what\u2019s known as \"fair notice\" that its sales of XRP were illegal since the agency brought the case long after the company began issuing the tokens.\n\nUntil recently, observers believed the judge was inclined to side with Ripple, given what they viewed as her fair interpretation of the law and criticism of some of the litigation tactics used by SEC lawyers. Now, they\u2019re not so sure. With the May implosion of the blockchain platform Terra, and the November collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, and the indictment of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried on fraud charges, many people inside the crypto industry say an outright win for Ripple could be difficult. The collapse of the two largest crypto-friendly banks, Silvergate and Signature, could also have an impact on the final outcome.\n\n\"On the core legal issue of whether Ripple offered unregistered securities to the public, I think the SEC has the stronger argument,\" said Marc Fagel, former Regional Director of the SEC\u2019s San Francisco office. \"The case is complicated by the question of whether Ripple had \u2018fair notice\u2019 that XRP was a security. Even there, I don\u2019t see a compelling argument under legal precedent, even if missteps by the SEC along the way have brought it to the forefront.\"\n\nAmong the many reasons the outcome is important: to date, there has been no formal classification of digital assets. Crypto\u2019s legal status, thus, is open to interpretation by the SEC and the CFTC, resulting in a turf war of sorts over which regulator should regulate the asset class. It would also decide whether the SEC\u2019s current test for classifying securities should apply to digital assets. Known as the Howey Test, which resulted from a 1946 Supreme Court decision, it determines what qualifies as an investment contract, and thus is subject to U.S. securities laws.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s main argument is that Ripple broke the law by selling XRP as an investment contract to buyers, whom, they say, were relying on the efforts of Ripple to boost their profits. If the judge sides with the SEC, that could mean many other digital coins will be fair game to be classified as unregistered securities.\n\nWhile Ripple has not denied the sales of XRP occurred, the cryptocurrency company argues that they do not satisfy the Howey Test because there was never an investment contract between Ripple and buyers of the XRP token.\n\nCRYPTO ISSUES 'NOT JUST IDIOSYNCRATIC\u2019 TO THE SPACE, INDUSTRY EXPERT ARGUES\n\n\"Our point is, Ripple doesn\u2019t have a contract. With whom is the contract? It isn\u2019t a written contract, it\u2019s not an oral contract, it\u2019s not an implicit contract,\" said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in an interview with FOX Business\u2019 The Claman Countdown in September.\n\nThe issue surrounding the secondary market sales of XRP, meaning sales of the token to retail investors on exchanges, has made the case particularly important for the crypto investing public. When the SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, exchanges like Coinbase and Crypto.com de-listed XRP from their platforms, so investors could no longer buy or sell the token, effectively leaving their accounts in limbo.\n\nTotal losses to small investors and project developers using the XRP Ledger were said to total around $15 billion. After the SEC filed the case, the price of XRP fell 70% in just a few days. Today it's trading at $0.46 after hitting a high of $3.84 in 2018.\n\nThe situation sparked outrage among retail investors and resulted in the appointment of Rhode Island-based lawyer John Deaton as amicus curiae (\"friend of the court\"). Deaton currently represents the interests of 75,000 global XRP holders who were harmed by the lawsuit.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nIn addition to Deaton, fifteen other industry players and organizations, including Coinbase and The Blockchain Association, submitted amicus briefs either on behalf of Ripple or on behalf of the wider crypto industry. By comparison, the SEC received just two amicus briefs to support its case against Ripple.\n\n\"This case may set a precedent that could impact not only the digital asset industry, but also the capital markets,\" said Perianne Boring, founder and CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce in a statement to FOX Business. \"Our preference is that industry actors have clear guidance on how to operate as opposed to being subject to regulation by enforcement.\""
