        "content": "Ripple went through a considerable increase, but its upward trend slowed down upon reaching the critical resistance level of $0.58. Nevertheless, it appears to have a bullish perspective on the weekly timeframe.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Weekly Chart\n\nAfter a significant spike, XRP has successfully broken through the multi-year descending trendline, a key level on the weekly timeframe, providing a positive market sentiment.\n\nHowever, the price now faces two substantial barriers: the $0.53-$0.58 range and the 100-week moving average positioned at $0.63.\n\nIf XRP manages to surpass the $0.53-$0.58 zone, a rally toward the 100-week moving average becomes likely. Conversely, if the price fails to break above this range, the descending trendline will serve as Ripple\u2019s primary support level.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nXRP\u2019s price attempted to break the $0.58 level but was met with resistance, resulting in a reversal and a steady decline. However, after falling to $0.48, it entered a consolidation phase with low volatility.\n\nDuring this period, the price formed an ascending flag pattern and is currently testing the lower threshold. Presently, XRP faces two crucial support levels: the $0.48 minor support and the flag\u2019s lower trendline.\n\nIn summary, if the price drops below the lower trendline, the minor $0.48 zone will become Ripple\u2019s primary support in the 4-hour timeframe. Conversely, if Ripple can achieve another significant surge and break past the $0.58 resistance level, it could trigger an extended bullish rally toward the $0.63 zone."

        "content": "The top two single-largest XRP wallets belong to Ripple.\n\nDavid Schwartz, CTO at Ripple, has confirmed that Ripple generates the most revenue from selling its XRP holdings. According to Schwartz, this strategic move also aims to reduce the company\u2019s XRP holdings, further contributing to decentralization.\n\nIn a recent thread of tweets, Schwartz confirmed this by seeking to address certain misconceptions surrounding XRP and the XRP Ledger. A statement alleged that Ripple still actively sells its XRP holdings, and these sales account for 98% of the Silicon Valley firm\u2019s revenue.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn response, Schwartz noted that the statement is accurate in the broader sense of \u201csell.\u201d He further emphasized that Ripple only has two options regarding its XRP holdings- to sell or hold them. However, it has been agreed that selling the tokens is a better choice, as it contributes to decentralization.\n\n\u201cIf you define \u201csell\u201d broadly, then yes, \u201cselling\u201d XRP does account for most of Ripple\u2019s revenue.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n9. If you define \"sell\" broadly, then yes, \"selling\" XRP does account for most of Ripple's revenue. But realistically, our choices come down to selling XRP or holding XRP and most people think we hold too much.\n\n\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 13, 2023\n\nNotably, Ripple sells XRP tokens in connection with its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, which caters to multiple entities across nearly 40 payout markets. Ripple\u2019s report on XRP for Q4 2022 revealed that the technology firm sold $226.31 million worth of XRP in the quarter alone. This figure was $310.68 million in Q3 2022.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nResponding to Schwartz\u2019s latest disclosure, a pseudonymous crypto proponent questioned why Ripple decided to sell off its XRP instead of leveraging it for the Liquidity Hub solution.\n\nRecall that Ripple recently launched Liquidity Hub, but omitted XRP from the product. The firm cited the regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP due to the SEC case as the reason behind this.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing else Ripple can realistically do with its XRP, and the general consensus is that it would be better if Ripple held less XRP,\u201d Schwartz responded to the individual\u2019s inquiries.\n\nThere is nothing else Ripple can realistically do with its XRP and the general consensus is that it would be better if Ripple held less XRP. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 14, 2023\n\nRipple\u2019s Sales: A Win for Decentralization\n\nBeing the issuer of XRP, Ripple is the single largest holder of XRP. Data from CoinCarp shows that the first two largest XRP wallets collectively hold over 2.7 billion XRP tokens, representing 3.73% of the asset\u2019s circulating supply. These wallets, and numerous others, are owned by Ripple. Periodically offloading its XRP holdings contributes to decentralization."

        "content": "As Ripple Labs remains locked in a lawsuit with the SEC about whether XRP is a security, the crypto asset is not yet part of its newly launched liquidity hub.\n\nWhile some have questioned whether the decision is a signal the company is bearish on its asset amid a lawsuit with the SEC, executives at the crypto company clarified the reasoning for excluding the asset Monday, adding that the omission could be temporary.\n\nRipple revealed its intention in November 2021 to launch Liquidity Hub \u2014 a product using smart order routing to source digital assets at certain prices from market makers, exchanges and OTC desks. The hub would offer access to XRP, bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), ethereum classic (ETC) and bitcoin cash (BCH).\n\nRipple said in a blog post last week its liquidity pools would cover BTC, ETH, LTC, ETC, BCH, as well as US dollars (USD) and stablecoins USD Coin (USDC) and tether (USDT).\n\n\u201cXRP will be evaluated along with other tokens for support within the product,\u201d the blog states. \u201cWe look forward to supporting XRP as it receives regulatory clarity in the US.\u201d\n\nThe SEC alleged in 2020 that Ripple Labs and two of its executives raised more than $1.3 billion in 2013 through what it deemed to be an unregistered security offering of XRP. The case is ongoing.\n\nAn SEC complaint against Bittrex filed Monday named six \u200b\u200btokens listed on its platform \u2014 DASH, ALGO, OMG, TKN, NGC and IHT \u2014 as securities.\n\nRegulatory clarity is important to the enterprise customers for which the hub was designed, Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty tweeted Monday. He added that the low liquidity for the asset in the US was another reason XRP wasn\u2019t included.\n\n\u201cOur product team has been very clear \u2014 [Liquidity Hub] was built to access all kinds of crypto liquidity, not just XRP,\u201d Alderoty tweeted. \u201cOur target [Liquidity Hub] customers \u2014 today mainly institutions in the US \u2014 want access to a variety of tokens like BTC, ETH, and stablecoins.\u201d\n\nThe chief legal officer added that Ripple\u2019s on-demand liquidity (ODL) product has for years, and will continue to, use XRP.\n\nBrad Chase, Ripple\u2019s head of liquidity products, told Blockworks in an email that Ripple is \u201ckeen to support XRP\u201d for Liquidity Hub \u201cwhen we can provide a good customer experience, and based on customer demand.\u201d\n\nTaking the cautious approach?\n\nAttorney John Deaton, a partner at Deaton Law Firm who led a class action lawsuit against the SEC alleging its enforcement action against Ripple harmed XRP investors, said in a Twitter Space Monday that he wouldn\u2019t blame people for viewing Ripple\u2019s decision as \u201ca slap in the face.\u201d\n\nStill, he added, the decision for Ripple to exclude XRP from the Liquidity Hub wasn\u2019t surprising, and likely makes legal sense.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re offering liquidity for businesses,\u201d Deaton said. \u201cSo it isn\u2019t that Ripple isn\u2019t still believing that XRP is not a security. [It\u2019s about] what are these businesses\u2019 appetite for risk and are they going to include or engage when there\u2019s this one token that\u2019s being hotly debated and contested as being a security?\u201d\n\nDeaton added that including XRP in Liquidity Hub could have spurred the SEC to try to shut down the offering.\n\n\u201cIt just removes any unnecessary risk when you\u2019re launching a new product line,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s one of those things where the conservative approach is going to win the day.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing lawsuit with the SEC has not stopped Ripple Labs from pouring billions of dollars into buying back the XRP token on secondary markets, a Blockworks analysis of the company\u2019s quarterly reports found.\n\nRipple has spent nearly $8.4 billion to buy XRP since the beginning of 2021 as a way to protect the token\u2019s markets and its customers, the disclosures show.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "The Ripple Effect: How Good Governance Builds Outward in Commercial Banking - TriplePundit",
        "content": "The introduction of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into financial reporting is slowly but surely bringing clarity to the often complex realm of banking. Driven by calls for transparency from governments and investors, as well as the transition to a low-carbon economy, banks are under pressure to evaluate ESG metrics in their investment and lending portfolios. For example, financial institutions are expected to reach net-zero emissions in their portfolios by 2050, among other ESG considerations shaping the sector.\n\nBanks must establish new strategies and assessments, as well as internal governance and accountability structures, to meet and manage these emerging expectations and requirements. Commercial banking is unique in that it faces more governance stressors compared to other industries. Banks are under strict regulatory oversight, have a wide range of exposure to enterprise risks and are highly sensitive to market volatility. On top of that, they\u2019re expected to lead a financial transformation by effectively managing their ESG risks and impacts: For example, if banks only lend to companies that meet a certain ESG threshold, it forces prospective borrowers to meet those requirements.\n\nGovernance in the commercial banking industry is complex \u2014 if not overwhelming. To shed some light on the topic, we can turn to the example of one bank that has been able to successfully manage its ESG obligations and emerge as a leader.\n\nFifth Third Bank\u2019s ESG leadership\n\nHeadquartered in Ohio, Fifth Third Bank is one of the largest banks in the Midwestern U.S., with more than 1,100 branches across 11 states. The company\u2019s commitment to sustainability has earned it high marks on ESG ratings systems like CDP and Sustainalytics, as well as building trust and confidence among its stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThese actions that we\u2019ve done are not because of the more recent ESG fad. It\u2019s part of our purpose-driven company,\u201d Mike Faillo, senior vice president and chief sustainability officer at Fifth Third Bank, told TriplePundit. \u201cFocusing on sustainability has been part of our business for a lot longer, and that has put us in a position of leadership.\u201d\n\nWhile the ESG movement may be a relatively new development, the idea of social responsibility in banking has a long history. In 1977, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) required banks to service the credit needs of all segments of their communities, particularly those of low-income neighborhoods. In the following decades, corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives gained traction and prompted banks and other companies to consider the social impacts of their actions. Fast forward to the current day and we have the ESG movement, complete with ESG investment products, ESG bonds, and ESG rating scales widely available to consumers and investors.\n\nWith the complexities involved, many bank leaders know they should be setting ESG targets, measuring their progress, reporting their metrics, and publicly disclosing their findings. But exactly how to do that remains the big question.\n\nHow good governance drives ESG strategy\n\n\u201cWe believe in transparency, credibility and telling our story,\u201d Faillo told TriplePundit. \u201cTransparency is what breeds trust. To make commitments and then report on those commitments, whether you\u2019re achieving them or not, is what builds the trust.\u201d\n\nThe key to achieving sustainability goals and mitigating ESG risks in banking lies in a strong and committed leadership structure. \u201cWe used to joke back when ESG was first coined that GSE was already taken so they went with ESG, because governance would\u2019ve been the most important,\u201d Faillo said.\n\nEngagement with stakeholders, both external and internal, to identify priorities and challenges is one of the key first steps in developing a strong ESG strategy. Fifth Third conducts stakeholder materiality assessments to determine which sustainability topics are top of mind. The engagement groups include shareholders, customers, employees, communities and regulators. The methods of engagement are extensive, but include shareholder meetings, focus groups, engagement surveys, business resource groups, and community needs surveys and assessments.\n\nAs a result of these stakeholder engagement efforts, Fifth Third\u2019s sustainability committee identified \u2014 and the board of directors approved \u2014 five corporate sustainability priorities for the company: addressing climate change, promoting inclusion and diversity, delivering on its commitment to employees, keeping the customer at the center, and strengthening the communities where the company does business. Each priority has related metrics and goals that can be measured and tracked to gauge performance.\n\nThe priorities, goals, and progress are then communicated to the public to show transparency, provide accountability and build trust. The bank also includes sustainability performance on those identified priorities as a modifier to its employee variable compensation plan \u2014 which affects a wide group of employees, not just the bank\u2019s executives. More details on Fifth Third\u2019s sustainability strategy and accountability mechanisms can be found in its most recent ESG report.\n\nThe commitment to those sustainability priorities is also evident by the company\u2019s sustainability business resource group, which is open to all employees across the business. \u201cThe group is focused on driving employee development and education on sustainability topics,\u201d Faillo said. \"We bring in speakers, both externally and internally, to teach and discuss these topics. It also focuses on community involvement and business innovation.\u201d The group has over 750 members and drives many of the company\u2019s ideas about how to overcome hurdles and improve ESG priority performance.\n\nAlong with the contribution from employees on ESG topics, the bank\u2019s executives also chair a sustainability committee that meets on a quarterly basis to review metrics and provide another layer of internal accountability. The committee is chaired by the chief corporate responsibility officer, and includes the bank president and CEO, among other high-level executives.\n\nThe commitment from Fifth Third to integrate sustainability into day-to-day operations, and not just as something to be done once a year on the side, allows the bank and its employees to be recognized as sustainability leaders in their industry.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for ESG in commercial banking?\n\nThe landscape of ESG reporting is constantly changing, and sustainability leaders need to keep updated on the latest developments. In the U.S., mandatory climate disclosure rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are expected to take effect in 2024, with reporting required for large companies. Similar disclosure regulations are already on the books in the European Union and the U.K., and mandatory disclosures are coming soon to Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland and other countries.\n\nMost disclosure requirements for financial institutions are based on the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. A global standard for reporting is also in the works from the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and is expected to be adopted by more than 40 countries as their mandatory disclosure requirement.\n\nBanks require strong governance structures to prepare for those reporting obligations and develop comprehensive ESG strategies that are integrated into the business. Fifth Third\u2019s work represents a promising blueprint for others in the sector.\n\nThis article series is sponsored by Workiva and produced by the TriplePundit editorial team.\n\nImage courtesy of Fifth Third Bank"
