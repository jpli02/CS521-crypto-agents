        "content": "Changpeng Zhao \u2013 CEO of Binance \u2013 dismissed the speculation that the popular TV personality Jim Cramer declared his approval of the largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nSome crypto proponents joked that this is actually good news for the trading venue, considering Cramer\u2019s controversial statements and predictions in the past. The host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money\u201d has given his prognosis to investors multiple times, but often that has turned wrong.\n\nBinance is \u2018Saved\u2019\n\nThe cryptocurrency community was baffled yesterday (September 5) when several X (Twitter) users hinted that Jim Cramer is bullish on Binance and is \u201cloading up\u201d on BNB tokens. Some individuals jokingly forecasted a grim future for the exchange since the TV personality is famous for his controversial predictions.\n\nOne example is his advice to people to purchase stocks of Silicon Valley Bank in February this year. The financial institution collapsed a month later, intensifying the overall banking crisis in America.\n\nX user going by the name \u201cCrypto Busy\u201d clarified that Cramer\u2019s statement on Binance and its native token is fake. He explained that the screenshot of \u201cMad Money\u2019s\u201d host is from September 2022, where he talks about Treasuries. CNBC has also not uploaded such a video where Cramer praises the crypto exchange and its boss \u2013 Changpeng Zhao (also known as CZ).\n\nThe latter retweeted Crypto Busy\u2019s revelation, urging his followers not to trust a \u201cphotoshopped image.\u201d Expectedly, he concluded his post with the number \u201c4\u201d \u2013 a signature he uses to urge individuals to ignore media propaganda and misleading information.\n\nphew\u2026 saved. \ud83d\ude02 Don\u2019t believe in a photoshopped image, guys. 4 https://t.co/3jX2LvMQOV \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) September 5, 2023\n\nWhen Was Cramer Wrong?\n\nThere are plenty of examples when the former fund manager (who has changed his stance on crypto numerous times in the past few years) has counseled investors to sell bitcoin or other digital currencies. However, in many cases, his advice has not been precisely spot on.\n\nIn December last year, he argued that individuals should cash out their crypto holdings, adding that it\u2019s never too late to exit the ecosystem:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just beat yourself up and say, \u2018hey, it\u2019s too late to sell.\u2019 The truth is, it\u2019s never too late to sell an awful position, and that\u2019s what you have if you own these so-called digital assets.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin was hovering around $17,000 at the time, whereas currently, it is around $25,700 (a 50% increase).\n\nHe doubled down in March, suggesting investors use the price rally as a selling opportunity. Nonetheless, bitcoin kept its uptrend, causing Elon Musk to mock Cramer\u2019s market advice."
