At present, TVL stands at approximately $3.2 billion.\n\nIn contrast, the number of users displayed a reverse trend compared to the TVL.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a recent tweet by Chinese journalist and crypto blogger Colin Wu, the SEC has spread the word about a list of cryptos it believes to be securities. The list has been published by CoinGecko analytics platform.\n\nThe list includes as many as 48 digital currencies. Among them are some top 10 and top 20 digital cryptocurrencies \u2014 Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Algorand (ALGO), Tron (TRX) and many others.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are not on this list. Neither is the Ripple-affiliated XRP coin.\n\nCoingecko has opened a list of tokens listed as securities by the US SEC. There are a total of 48 tokens, including BNB ADA SOL TRX MATIC TON BUSD ATOM FIL ICP NEAR ALGO SAND AXS MANA FLOW CHZ BTT and more. https://t.co/KE3GI0D3cx \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 7, 2023\n\nSEC's witch hunt on altcoins\n\nThe SEC has recently been conducting quite an aggressive campaign against all cryptos but Bitcoin and Ethereum, claiming that pretty much all digital tokens are in fact unregistered securities since there are developers who sell their tokens to investors, and those investors expect profits from those digital currencies. This is similar to the principle on which shares, stocks and other securities work, according to the chair of the U.S. regulator, Gary Gensler.\n\nThe very first \"victim\" of the securities agency of the U.S. was Ripple Labs fintech behemoth and the XRP token it works with. The SEC accused the company, its cofounder Chris Larsen and the current chief executive Brad Garlinghouse of selling XRP as unregistered securities to both institutional and retail investors earning more than $1 billion.\n\nThis summer, as reported by U.Today, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that it is only institutional sales of XRP that can be legally called securities but not XRP sales in the secondary market.\n\nEverything is security but Bitcoin\n\nGary Gensler is positive that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that can be free from the labels of a \"security.\" As for Ethereum, his stance here remains somewhat unclear as he recently stated that the second biggest cryptocurrency might still be a security.\n\nCardano's native token ADA has also been on the list of securities recently, and founder of IOG Charles Hoskinson, the company behind Cardano blockchain, has opposed that opinion several times on his Twitter page.\n\nThe aforementioned list of the SEC also includes HEX, DASH, BTT, FIL, BUSD and ATOM."

        "content": "Thaiwatsadu to open 3 more stores in final months of 2023\n\nThe entrance of Thaiwatsadu x BnB home in Samut Prakan province. This is the company's fourth branch in the province, complementing stores on Bang Na-Trat Road, in Bang Phli and Phra Pradaeng.\n\nCRC Thaiwatsadu Co, a home improvement and material construction unit under Central Retail Corporation, plans to open three new stores during the remaining five months of this year.\n\nSuthisarn Chirathivat, Thaiwatsadu's chief executive, said the company invested 470 million baht to open its latest Thaiwatsadu x BnB home branch, with a space of 20,000 square metres, in the Muang Samut Prakan district of Samut Prakan province on Thursday.\n\nIn addition, the company is scheduled to open its second store in Chiang Mai next month, followed by another store in Sri Sa Ket province.\n\nFor 2023, Thaiwatsadu aims to open 10 new branches. As of this month, the company has launched eight new branches under the Thaiwatsadu x BnB home and Thaiwatsadu concepts, covering significant locations in Bangkok and other regions.\n\nAccording to Mr Suthisarn, this expansion aligns with CRC's \"retailligence\" strategic plan and is well-timed with the positive trajectory of the construction material market and real estate sector, both of which have regained momentum after years of stagnation.\n\nHe said the Samut Prakan store marks the company's fourth establishment in the province, complementing the existing branches on Bang Na-Trat Road, in Bang Phli and Phra Pradaeng.\n\nMr Suthisarn said Samut Prakan has recorded a growing economic prominence, which is increasing demand for construction materials and home furnishings from entrepreneurs, businesses of all sizes, retail customers, and the province's vast population of more than 198,500 households.\n\nStrategically positioned, the new branch also serves the needs of residents in nearby districts.\n\nThe store offers a range of construction materials and home furnishings from renowned brands, boasting more than 40,000 items.\n\nThe Thaiwatsadu x BnB concept strives to cater to the needs of the hardware and electrical equipment segments, offering hand tools, electrical appliances, bathroom accessories, kitchen essentials, bedroom furnishings and home decorations.\n\nLocated to the east of Bangkok, the branch leverages the purchasing power of the area, while also catering to large projects in promising regions such as Samut Prakan, Sukhumvit and Srinakarin, he said.\n\nIn a step towards sustainability, the new branch installed solar panels on its roof, generating 1 megawatt peak of renewable energy through an off-grid system.\n\nMr Suthisarn said this initiative can reduce electricity bills by up to 40-50%.\n\n\"We are confident in the immense potential of the province, driven by its robust transport, public facilities and route expansion plans, as well as the growing interest from companies undertaking significant development projects,\" he said.\n\n\"All of these factors have enabled Thaiwatsadu to become a trusted brand and a platform that consistently meets the evolving needs of its expanding customer base.\""

        "content": "Although both Binance Coin (BNB) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) boast unique features and use cases, their trajectories have been remarkably eventful, filled with price hikes and groundbreaking news that have captivated investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nIn this article we delve into the news surrounding Binance Coin and Shiba Inu, exploring the factors behind their price fluctuations and the significant news that has influenced their trajectories.\n\nPrices and market statistics of Binance Coin and Shiba Inu\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the price of the cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) stands at $0.00000926 per unit.\n\nOver the past 7 days, the price of SHIBA INU has seen a significant increase of 10.78%, signaling interesting growth in the market.\n\nThe market capitalization of the cryptocurrency amounts to $5.5 billion, while the trading volume of the past 24 hours reaches $304.0 million, demonstrating investors\u2019 continued interest in this digital asset.\n\nCurrently, there are 589.3 billion SHIB in circulation, and the average holding time of the cryptocurrency is 222 days.\n\nDespite its price fluctuations, Shiba Inu ranked as the 12th most popular cryptocurrency, highlighting its growing relevance in the crypto ecosystem. SHIB\u2019s all-time high was $0.000032, an important figure for those who closely follow market trends.\n\nWith a positive price change of 10.78% over the past 7 days, investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting further developments for this ever-evolving coin.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nThe price of the cryptocurrency Binance Coin (BNB) stands at $243.84 per unit. Over the past 7 days, the price of BNB has slightly increased by 0.18%, showing a stable market pace.\n\nThe market capitalization of Binance Coin has reached the amount of $37.5 billion, while the trading volume of the last 24 hours amounts to $376.6 million, reflecting a steady interest from investors in this digital currency.\n\nThere are currently 153.9 million BNB in circulation, which helps strengthen its position in the cryptocurrency landscape. BNB\u2019s all-time high was $690.93, a significant level that could be a benchmark for investors and analysts closely following the coin\u2019s price.\n\nWith a modest 0.18% growth over the past week, Binance Coin is showing signs of resilience and continues to generate interest in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBinance Coin prepares for mainnet upgrade\n\nBNB Chain, the native blockchain of Binance Coin (BNB), is preparing for a significant mainnet upgrade in August, with the goal of addressing the declining metrics observed in recent months.\n\nDespite the difficulties, BNB managed to accomplish a remarkable feat, surpassing Ripple (XRP) to become the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nThe data revealed a decline in the amount of gas on BNB Smart Chain, indicative of less activity on the blockchain.\n\nAs a result, the acquired value of the platform has also been trending downward, reflected in plummeting fees and revenues. In addition, the DeFi space on the BNB Chain has seen troubling developments, with declines in total value locked (TVL), active addresses, and transactions.\n\nBNB\u2019s hope on new updates\n\nHowever, there is hope on the horizon: BNB Chain has announced its next mainnet update, version 1.2.9 for the BSC mainnet.\n\nScheduled for 10 August, the first update will introduce the Plato and Hertz hard forks, while the second is scheduled for 30 August 2023.\n\nThis update is expected to make improvements to the blockchain\u2019s gas metering system, impose restrictions on contract distribution, introduce a new EVM opcode, and implement new transaction types, following the guidelines of BEP 225 and BEP 230 under the Berlin update.\n\nAs the development of the upgrade progressed, BNB bulls entered the market, contributing to a marginal increase in the value of the coin.\n\nBinance Coin surpasses Ripple\n\nThis momentum allowed BNB to surpass XRP and reclaim its position as the fourth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. The increase in BNB\u2019s social volume and improved sentiment around the coin further strengthened its position, while the green funding rate reflects the high demand in the futures market.\n\nHowever, the relative strength index (RSI) moved sideways at the neutral level, while the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained bearish with a slight decline.\n\nWith the mainnet upgrade on the horizon and positive market developments, BNB is showing resilience in the face of challenges.\n\nInvestors and users are anxiously awaiting the impact of the upcoming update on blockchain performance and metrics. The update\u2019s ability to address declining gas quantity and other concerns in the DeFi space could potentially rejuvenate interest in and usage of the BNB blockchain.\n\nAs the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, BNB is positioning itself for further growth and importance within the cryptocurrency market. Rivalry for top ranking positions is fierce, but BNB has demonstrated its determination to compete and succeed.\n\nThe upcoming mainnet update could be a turning point for BNB Chain, elevating it to new heights and reaffirming its importance in the ever-expanding world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nInvestors and enthusiasts are closely watching developments as BNB aims to reclaim its place at the forefront of the digital financial revolution.\n\nShytoshi Kusama, leader of Shiba Inu, routs scammers amid enthusiasm for Summer of Shibarium campaign\n\nShiba Inu, the cryptocurrency inspired by a meme, is causing a stir in the cryptocurrency community with its highly anticipated \u201cSummer of Shibarium\u201d campaign.\n\nAs excitement grows for the release of new tokens and the launch of the project\u2019s Layer 2 blockchain, Shibarium, lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has been actively fighting the wave of misinformation and scams targeting investors of the coin.\n\nRecently, a Twitter post claimed that two new tokens, TREAT and SHI, would be launched as part of the \u201cSummer of Shibarium\u201d campaign. However, Kusama was quick to deny this information, dismissing it as a scam and warning the community to remain vigilant.\n\nUnfortunately, this incident is just one of many scams that have surfaced during the preparation of the \u201cSummer of Shibarium\u201d campaign.\n\nThe hype surrounding the strategic initiative has increased market interest in SHIB and related tokens, creating an ideal environment for scammers to exploit unsuspecting investors.\n\nThe \u201cSummer of Shibarium\u201d campaign promises a series of exciting releases, leading up to the highly anticipated launch of the Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain in August.\n\nAlthough the legitimate excitement is well founded, Kusama stresses the need for caution and investor education in the face of fraudulent activity.\n\nIn response to growing concerns, the Shibarmy Scam Alerts Twitter account has been actively warning the community about fake support accounts and suspicious links circulating in the crypto space. Kusama, as a constant advocate of vigilance, urges investors to thoroughly scrutinize all sources of information before making any decisions.\n\nExcitement and caution, the right balance for investing in meme coins\n\nAs the launch of Shibarium approaches, it is critical that Shiba Inu enthusiasts and investors strike a balance between excitement and caution. The cryptocurrency space is full of opportunities, but also risks, so it is essential to remain alert and discerning.\n\nMarket participants should be wary of promises that seem too good to be true, as scams can take many forms, including the issuance of fake tokens, phishing attempts, and Ponzi schemes. Using official channels and verifying information from reliable sources can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to scams.\n\nKusama\u2019s commitment to protecting the Shiba Inu community from scams is a testament to the importance of promoting a secure and transparent cryptographic environment. With the Summer of Shibarium campaign on the horizon, the community must join efforts to stay informed and support each other."
