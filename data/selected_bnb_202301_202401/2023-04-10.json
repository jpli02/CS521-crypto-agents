        "title": "Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin holds $28000; Ethereum tops $1850; Altcoins flat - Business Today",
        "content": "After a long and dull weekend, Bitcoin and other crypto assets were almost flat on Monday. The movement in prices was minuscule. The market leader has traded in a very tight range in the last week, barely moving much.\n\n\n\nBitcoin rose almost a per cent on Monday to firmly hold $28,300 levels, while its largest peer Ethereum was also trading in green to hold above $1,850. However, the action in the crypto assets was majorly muted amid the thin trading volumes.\n\n\n\nOver the weekend, most cryptocurrencies saw a rise in value due to the non-farm payrolls report indicating an addition of 236,000 jobs to the US economy in the previous month, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin specifically surpassed the $28,000 level, with its support at $27,900 and resistance at $29,200. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trying to reach the $1,900 level and is presently trading at the $1,850 level ahead of the Shanghai update, scheduled on Wednesday,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTop crypto tokens were trading mixed on Monday. However, the action in the crypto assets was capped. Dogecoin rose more than a percent, whereas Solana was also almost a per cent up. BNB and Avalanche also edged higher. Among the losers, Polygon dropped over a per cent, while XRP also shed a per cent. Polkadot and Cardano were also in the red.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly higher, hovering around $1.18 trillion, rising less than half a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes spiked almost 11 per cent to $29.98 billion.\n\n\n\nIf Bitcoin is able to break through its current resistance level, we may see a significant price increase, potentially reaching $28,900 or even $29,250, said Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, Unocoin.\n\n\n\n\"On the other hand, if the current downturn continues, we can expect significant support around $26,500 and $25,500. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at around $28,200, Ethereum at $1,852 and BNB at $312, with market sentiment remaining cautiously optimistic,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTech View By Giottus\n\nThe new Luna (ticker: LUNA / LUNA2) coin has seen a steep decline in value over the weekend, going from a high of $1.5 to a low in the vicinity of $1.3 in the early hours of Monday. The drop comes amidst news about its founder Do Kwon\u2019s impending extradition and allegations that he converted funds to Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drop is fairly technical, too, with rejection coming off a major confluence of its 50-day moving average, the .236 fib retracement of its range in 2023, and a long-term trendline. The bearish argument is strong - LUNA did fail to register a new high and register a market structure change. However, the $1.3 level is strong support and this could be a healthy pullback that propels LUNA to new highs. This range may present a buying opportunity.\n\n\n\nKey levels\n\nSupport: $1.3, $1.25, $1.22\n\nResistances: $1.44, $1.5, $1.6\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

Initially I said to my husband let's think about it,' Ms Bretherton said.\n\n'The following day I was taking the dog for a walk. I heard this noise behind me and when I turned around it was a Laura Ashley lorry, it had got stuck down the lanes.\n\n'After helping him, all the way home I was going 'oh that was a sign' and that was is it.'\n\nLaura Ashley's former home in Machynlleth, North Wales\n\nLinda Bretherton has been restoring the property as part of a passion project\n\nThe property features original oak floors and wooden wall panels that were transported by train by Ashley's husband Bernard.\n\nThe couple have installed new electrics and plumbing also restoring original features in the home.\n\nMs Bretherton explained: 'All the floors are all the original oak floors - which are fabulous. There's a fantastic little spiral staircase which is all in oak, all of that had to be cleaned off and re-varnished.\n\n'We didn't want to have to rip out walls, some of the walls are just oak wood back-to-back, you can see through them.\n\n'We were told that Bernard Ashley had carried some of the panelling, he got it from Y Plas near Newtown and he carried it back on the train.'\n\nShe also revealed how she collected vintage garments from a seamstress who worked in the nearby Laura Ashley factory and has been gifted items from across the globe.\n\n'They are gorgeous all original Laura Ashley fabrics, dresses, blouses, skirt, trousers all over 35 years old, all made by a local lady who worked in the Machynlleth factory.\n\nThe property features original oak floors and wooden wall panels\n\nREAD MORE: Laura Ashley is set to revive its floral collections Advertisement\n\n'In lunch times they were allowed to sew and make their own things using patterns and she made these then. So I've got loads of these gorgeous fabrics, patterns and dresses.\n\n'They're going to be on display, some of them I'm not going to part with because they are just iconic.'\n\nAshley, who opened more than 230 stores around the world with her signature designs, had such great success that she was able to afford a yacht, a private plane, the French Ch\u00e2teau de Remaisnil in Picardy and a town-house in Brussels.\n\nShe also owned the mansion Rhydoldog House in Powys, Wales, before she died in 1985 which was bought by singer Charlotte Church.\n\nMs Church bought the \u00a31.5 mansion to spend her life savings transforming it into a wellness retreat in the countryside.\n\nFans will be able to stay at the Machynlleth home when bookings open in May."
