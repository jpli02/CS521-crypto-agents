        "content": "The Binance ecosystem has completed its 23rd quarterly BNB token burn. The second quarterly burn includes an Auto-Burn as well as the Pioneer Burn Program where 2,020,132.25 BNB was burned via the Auto-Burn and 656.0230123 BNB effectively burned via the Pioneer Burn Program. The burn value in USD amounts to $676,744,304 and the Real Burn (Auto-Burn \u2013 Pioneer Burn) totaled 2,019,476.2269877 BNB.\n\nBinance made a commitment upon the launch of the platform in 2017 to remove 100 million BNB which is half of its total supply from circulation through a burning process. This means only 100 million BNB will be kept in circulation.\n\nIn 2021 Binance introduced a new procedure for quarterly BNB Burn, BNB Auto Burn. Interestingly, the burn will be based on the price of BNB. BNB Auto-Burn is an independent auditable method separate from Binance\u2019s centralized exchange. The numbers are released quarterly and a percentage of BNB Chain\u2019s gas fees are also still burned in real-time using the Real-Time-Burn method.\n\nThe Pioneer Burn Program also permanently removes from the market an amount of BNB equal to the money that has been proven to have been lost by qualified BNB Chain users. The overall quarterly burn amount is then calculated using the value obtained. Over 145,600 BNBs have been burned using this since the release of BEP-95. BEP-95 refers to Binance Evolution Proposal and introduces a real-time burning mechanism to BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nBNB facilitates the BNB Chain ecosystem and is the native coin of the BNB Beacon Chain, the BNB Smart Chain, and the latest BNB Greenfield blockchain.\n\nGreenfield is a newly announced blockchain released in February 2023. It is a decentralized storage infrastructure for the webspace that enables users and decentralized apps (DApps) to produce, store, and exchange data with full ownership, thereby building a new data economy.\n\n23rd Quarterly BNB Burn Txid: https://explorer.bnbchain.org/tx/926B2A741628272FE9CC3883485CED145EADFE7EB3A900F3E5A45DD70AAEB25D\n\nThe market impact after 24 hours according to Coinmarketcap shows the price of BNB at $333.74 with a 24-hour trading volume of $766,876,569. BNB is up 0.28% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing.\n\nRead also;\n\nFloki teams up with Badminton Asia\n\nWhat do you think of this article? Share comments below."

        "content": "The TUSD team has announced the launch of its stablecoin TUSD on the BNB Chain as a native token. Individual and institutional clients can now mint and redeem native BSC (BNB Smart Chain) TUSD using the TUSD website. This action represents a turning point in TUSD\u2019s multi-chain deployment and opens the door for TUSD\u2019s deeper integration into the BSC (BNB Smart Chain) ecosystem.\n\nTUSD has embraced the multi-chain movement in recent years and has backed several chains, supplying reliable, high-quality liquidity to some DeFi ecosystems to strengthen their infrastructure.\n\nTUSD has been implemented on more than ten different public chains in addition to being native to a few other blockchains, such as TRON and Ethereum, in addition to BNB Smart Chain. TUSD holders can now participate in diverse blockchain ecosystems more quickly and easily through the support of crypto exchanges like Binance, Huobi, Poloniex, and OKX to deposit and withdraw different versions of TUSD.\n\nTUSD has formed a strong partnership with the Binance ecosystem. In terms of exchanges, the Binance exchange has introduced 13 TUSD spot trading pairs, including \u201cTUSD/BTC, TUSD/ETH, TUSD/BNB, and TUSD/ARB,\u201d with a trading volume of approximately $1,234,642,407 in the previous day.\n\nFurthermore, TUSD has been added to many Binance products, such as Binance VIP Loan and Binance Launchpad. Binance Futures supports TUSD as a margin asset in Multi-Assets Mode.\n\nTUSD has been successfully deployed on various chains within the BSC ecosystem and went live on PancakeSwap, Ellipsis, and other decentralized exchanges in the ecosystem. TUSD is also supported by some lending protocols, including Venus and Valas, as well as yield aggregators such as Acryptos and Beefy. As a result of these developments, it is anticipated that TUSD will gain acceptance from a larger group of users and protocols, further solidifying its position within the Binance ecosystem.\n\nAbout TUSD\n\nTUSD is the first stablecoin to provide live 24-hour attestation on the blockchain. TUSD\u2019s collaboration with many banks and other organizations allows holders to mint and redeem their tokens around the clock. TUSD also uses some other techniques to guarantee industry-leading stability, security, and transparency. It evolved to become the first stablecoin with USD backing to use Proof of Reserves to safeguard minting after connecting with Chainlink.\n\nStablecoins serve as a link between cryptocurrencies and the real world. It is envisaged that TUSD will continue to be a model of openness, security, and robustness, extending its use cases at a lower cost while bringing in more market-oriented options and higher returns for its users.n\n\nRead Also;\n\nhttps://cryptotvplus.com/2023/04/cryptogpt-raises-10m-in-funding-valued-at-250m/"

        "title": "A puzzle inspired this Victorian-style bed-and-breakfast in Lake Stevens | HeraldNet.com - The Daily Herald",
        "content": "Jessica Miguel is manager and caretaker of the Mansion Inn in Lake Stevens. Olivia Vanni / The Herald\n\nBy Sara Bruestle\n\nDespite its majesty, it\u2019s likely you don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there. On the north shore of Lake Stevens, near Everett, WA, a Victorian beauty reigns.\n\nAbout a 15-minute stroll from downtown, the Mansion Inn is an award-winning bed-and-breakfast with lake and mountain views on all three floors.\n\nThe rambling 10,490-square-foot home features six rooms for rent, a grand staircase in the lobby, two dining rooms, a great room with fireplace, an 11-foot bar, a chef\u2019s kitchen and a pool.\n\nThe B&B has earned six Booking.com\u2019s Guest Review Awards, the latest from 2021, but out of nearly 500 guests who booked a room within the last year, only about 20 were from the area. It\u2019s a Lake Stevens secret.\n\n\u201cWe have found that 90 percent of the locals don\u2019t know this is here,\u201d said Jessica Miguel, who keeps the inn. \u201cThat\u2019s basically nobody.\u201d\n\nWhile built in the Victorian style, construction of the Mansion Inn at Lake Stevens dates closer to the current king than the former queen. The history of this royal retreat, its exterior draped in cerulean blue and chestnut brown, spans only about two decades.\n\nMost of the rooms boast views of Lake Stevens and the Cascade Range. Olivia Vanni / The Herald\n\nThe Victorian aesthetic boomed from 1837 to 1901 amid Queen Victoria\u2019s reign in the U.K., with the trend hitting the U.S. about 50 years later.\n\nNineteenth century architects sought to create complex roof lines \u2014 with towers, turrets and dormers \u2014 that would pull the eye to the top of the house. These ornately decorated homes are characterized by high pitched roofs, wraparound porches, bay windows, stained glass, decorative trim and bright paint colors.\n\nIf you want the house to yourself, you can rent all six rooms \u2014 just know that the innkeepers will still be there. The Mansion Inn isn\u2019t run like a vacation rental.\n\nHosts Jessica and Aaron Miguel live on the third floor and in the carriage house above the garage, whereas the bed and breakfast comprises the first and second floors. The owners\u2019 quarters has five bedrooms, four bathrooms, a kitchen, family room, living room and a jetted-tub room.\n\nThe Miguels have been trying to piece together the history of the house since 2021. The thing is, Snohomish County property records tell only so much.\n\nHere\u2019s a piece of the puzzle: The Mansion Inn at Lake Stevens, according to Jessica, was inspired by a puzzle \u2013 literally.\n\nBrad and Sherri Whitsell wanted to own a bed-and-breakfast, but the husband and wife couldn\u2019t find a house that they liked in Snohomish County. While shopping in the toy aisle at Fred Meyer, Brad saw a puzzle featuring a Victorian home that looked like the Lake Stevens inn.\n\nThe house was exactly what they\u2019d been searching for, so Brad bought the puzzle, took it home to Sherri and said, \u201cHoney, I found our house.\u201d\n\nAfter purchasing a half-acre lot on Mitchell Drive, the Whitsells hired a father-and-son contractor to design and build the inn. The garage with carriage house was built in 2000, and so the owners lived there, while the bed and breakfast was under construction. Four years later, the Lake Stevens inn was open for business.\n\nWhether historical restorations or modern reproductions, there\u2019s one thing these Victorian homes have in common \u2014 there\u2019s no lack of character.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect for a weekend getaway,\u201d Jessica Miguel said. \u201cMaybe you just need a night out. Relax in your room, enjoy a nice hot breakfast, take in the views.\u201d\n\nJessica\u2019s father, Stephen Tracy, purchased the inn in 2021, the latest of about 10 who\u2019ve owned the house, according to property records.\n\n\u201cI was curious about it for about a year and a half,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cI fell in love with it the moment I walked through the doors. When I found out that it was for sale, and that it was a running business, that\u2019s when I realized I had to have it.\u201d\n\nLooking northeast from the Mansion Inn toward Lake Stevens and the Cascades. Olivia Vanni / The Herald\n\nIt just so happens that hospitality is Tracy\u2019s line of work. He also owns the Creekside Alehouse & Grill in Lake Stevens and Chan\u2019s Place, with locations in Woodinville and Issaquah.\n\nTracy, of Woodinville, asked the Miguels to move from Las Vegas to Lake Stevens to run the B&B. He wanted his daughter, son-in-law and grandkids to live closer to him \u2014 and this was a business opportunity for all of them.\n\nJust as Tracy hoped, the Mansion Inn is a family-run business. While Jessica, 45, and Aaron, 47, are the innkeepers, their kids, Cody, 25, and Adelaide, 15, help them prepare the rooms for guests each day. The four split the long list of chores \u2014 they\u2019ve learned to specialize their cleaning and maintenance tasks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a busy life, but it\u2019s a good life,\u201d Jessica Miguel said. \u201cI mean, look out the window at that view. It really is nice.\u201d\n\nFrom the home\u2019s many windows, you can see the blue expanse of the city\u2019s namesake \u2013 the largest natural lake in the county \u2013 rimmed by beaches and boat launches. If not the activity from canoes, jet skis, sailboats, surfboards, rowboats and windsurfers, you can take in the grandeur of the Cascade Range.\n\nAfter taking over the inn, the Miguels bought all new mattresses, bedding and towels. They also moved the laundry room to the second floor so no stairs are involved between loads of sheets and towels.\n\nThough she\u2019s no chef, Jessica whips up a hot breakfast from the chef\u2019s kitchen. Breakfast is served at 9 a.m. every day.\n\n\u201cI cook old-fashioned breakfasts like my grandma used to make \u2014 biscuits and gravy, fruit, scrambled eggs and the like \u2014 and our guests tend to love it,\u201d she said.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to take breakfast in one of the dining rooms, you can find a seat at one of three patio tables on the wraparound porch. It\u2019s a favorite breakfast spot among guests.\n\nCan\u2019t make the 9 a.m. breakfast? The inn also offers a to-go menu with toast and jam, bagels and cream cheese, muffins, etc.\n\nTracy said the Miguels\u2019 job is to make you feel like you\u2019re staying in a quaint B&B even though the house itself is, well, massive.\n\n\u201cWe try to keep it homey,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a beautiful job. The place is beautiful all the time.\u201d\n\nIf you go\n\nThe Mansion Inn, 1513 Mitchell Dr., Lake Stevens, is a bed and breakfast in a Victorian-style inn at Lake Stevens.
