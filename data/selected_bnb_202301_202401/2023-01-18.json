So, it's going to be February 16th through the 19th, right here at the bed and breakfast.\"\n\nShe continued: \"So, it's going to be about love, of course, because it's February. So rest, rejuvenation, pampering yourself, connecting with new friends and old friends.\"\n\nMeri went on to confirm that guests have three options to choose from when booking, which are Supreme, Elite, or Elite Plus.\n\nShe told potential customers: \"And then you just need to get here to the b&b on February 16th and I will take care of the rest!\"\n\nHowever, when fans went to the website and realized a Supreme stay costs $4,000 and an Elite Plus would cost $6,000, they took to the comments to have their say.\n\n\"Six. THOUSAND?!!! DOLLARS??!! What on earth could that include?! I\u2019m genuinely curious,\" one person wrote.\n\nAnother fumed: \"most of the usa is struggling putting food on the table and buying medicine and getting medical help and u charge this amount?? i use to support u but nah.\"\n\nA third person noted: \"That's a lot of money for 3 days in Utah? and not much is included,\" and a fourth said: \"I\u2019m pulling for you Mari, but these prices are ridiculously high.\"\n\nSomeone else commented: \"She\u2019s out of her damn mind thinking $6,000 is a feasible cost! To spend time with her\u2026 Hard pass here!\"\n\nAnd a different person added: \"I love Meri, but $6,000? I don't understand the mentality here. I run a food pantry and there are people (children) that are literally starving and living in motel rooms. I just couldn't spend that kind of money to hang out with Meri even if I could afford it.\"\n\nSomeone else mocked: \"Apparently she didn't learn the first time she tried this! 6k for what? And a love lesson from you?\"\n\nMeri's post comes just days after she shocked fans by defending her ex Kody and slamming the comments about him.\n\nMERI'S WRATH\n\nThe TLC star defended her ex-husband in a joint announcement that officially confirmed the couple had ended their marriage.\n\nMeri, 51, posted the statement on her Instagram last Tuesday.\n\nIn it she and Kody, 53, explained: \"In light of a recent unapproved press release, we feel compelled to share our own truth, in our own way, and in our own timing.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"After more than a decade of working on our relationship in our own unique ways, we have made the decision to permanently terminate our marriage relationship.\"\n\nThe former spouses added: \"During this process, we are committed to kindness and respect toward each other and all members of our family.\n\n\"We are also committed to the continued healing of any and all relationships with the family so that we can move forward with forgiveness, grace, and love.\"\n\nThe pair signed off with, \"In kindness, Meri and Kody.\"\n\nWhile the statement regarding the couple's divorce appeared to be congenial, the Sister Wives star sang a different, angrier tune in the post's caption.\n\nMeri began by writing: \"Today I reclaim my power,\" before focusing her annoyance on People, which first broke the news in December.\n\nShe wrote: \"Last month's article by the 'reputable' People Magazine quoting me as saying that I had 'confirmed' that Kody and I had separated was a complete lie.\"\n\nThe TV personality stated that the \"information, content, and timing was inaccurate\" adding that the information was \"based on a highly edited version of events that had been filmed months prior.\"\n\nDEFENDING KODY\n\nMeri then revealed that since \"the taping of those interviews,\" she and Kody participated in \"open and honest discussions\" that led to the announcement.\n\nThe reality TV star somewhat mysteriously added: \"There is so much more to be told about this story, and I assure you, my truth will be told. But for now, know that there is peace in my heart, and I hold no animosity toward Kody.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I am not, and pray that I never will be, in a place where I will enjoy making, or seeing you make, rude and demeaning comments about him.\"\n\nMeri then addressed her followers directly, writing: \"You likely will have a range of emotions and opinions at this news and want to offer comments.\n\n\"In doing so, please be considerate of the fact that we are real people, with real lives, and real emotions.\n\nThe mother-of-one asked her fans to \"refrain from congratulating\" her on the break up of her marriage,\" adding that she valued the relationship she and Kody had and \"look forward to stepping into 2023 and [her] future with grace, kindness, and power.\"\n\n5 In connection with Real Life Retreats, Meri offers guests the chance to stay at the bed and breakfast - but it's not cheap Credit: Instagram\n\n5 Meri told her followers that the retreat in Utah is all about 'rest, rejuvenation, and pampering' Credit: Instagram"
