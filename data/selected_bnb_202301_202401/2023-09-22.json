        "content": "As autumn creeps in, more and more people are feeling brave enough to give themselves the creeps by doing something they wouldn't normally do the rest of the year. How does staying at a certified \"haunted\" bed and breakfast sound? Well, we have one right here in Maine.\n\nGoogle Maps Google Maps loading...\n\nThe Chapman Inn is located in Bethel under the shadow of Sunday River, and for decades, the B&B was plagued by strange going-ons. Guests and caretakers were unable to explain the cold drafts, faint footsteps, opening and closing of doors, and the most goosebump-inducing of them all, female voices coming from empty rooms inside the inn. Several years ago, the Chapman Inn hired a paranormal investigator to answer the questions they couldn't, and the results were simple: your bed and breakfast is certified haunted.\n\nSo who or what is doing the haunting? It's all in the namesake of the inn. Abigail Chapman was the daughter of the owner of the estate, William Chapman. Abigail was not able to make friends as a child until William brought home a nanny. That nanny became Abigail's only true friend, and when Abigail passed at age 16, her spirit refused to leave the house and her friend. The nanny, rumored to have become William Chapman's mistress, stayed in the house until her own death in 1957, and joined Abigail's spirit.\n\nGoogle Maps Google Maps loading...\n\nThe Chapman Inn doesn't promise you'll experience anything supernatural if you choose to visit, but enough guests over the year have experienced the unexplained that they aren't afraid to talk about it. Are you ready to spend a chilly night with a couple of ghosts?\n\n25 Celebrities Who Have Owned Homes In Maine From Kittery to Islesboro, some of Hollywood's biggest names have owned homes in Maine. We explore the who and where."

        "title": "XRP Attorney Gives Three Clues Ahead Of His \u2018Big Announcement\u2019 Today Amid Ripple-SEC Battle - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nLegal expert John E. Deaton, representing over 75,000 XRP holders in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, has doused community tension with three intriguing clues regarding his promised \u201cbig announcement\u201d today.\n\nThe crypto lawyer shared the hints in a post on X (formerly Twitter) in response to a nudge from Jungle Inc., who he claimed was his friend.\n\nThe first hint of what the community should expect in his imminent big announcement was a photo of himself kneeling beside a small table, deeply engrossed in examining some paperwork.\n\nDeaton then named the XRP Ledger as his second clue. While Deaton has previously primarily focused on XRP\u2019s legal aspects and less on its technical prowess, the possibilities of the legal expert\u2019s plans for the XRPL are further fueling anticipation from the XRPArmy and the wider crypto community.\n\nThe final key clue provided by the XRP holders\u2019 attorney is that the announcement will also touch on the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) conducted by the Ethereum network back in 2014. The ether ICO was notably a resounding success, etching its name in the annals of cryptocurrency history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s still unknown what the connection is among these three diverse clues at the moment. Still, the announcement is primed to highlight the claims of Deaton and other pundits about the selective legal actions imposed against Ripple Labs and XRP.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that Deaton indicated earlier that everything needs to work out before he can share the announcement with the public. He has also clarified that the announcement is not about him filing a lawsuit against anyone.\n\nGiven that Deaton is an influential personality in the XRP community, whatever the announcement is about, it could shed light on the SEC\u2019s actions even as the protracted legal brawl with Ripple nears the conclusion. Meanwhile, the cryptoverse waits with bated breath to hear the verdict of the SEC\u2019s appeal bid."

        "title": "Crypto Price Analysis Sep-22: ETH, XRP, ADA, SOL, and BNB - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and Binance Coin.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nSince June, Ethereum has formed a large ascending triangle. However, yesterday, the price fell under this formation and closed the week with a 2% loss. This puts ETH in a difficult position as it signals this correction may just be starting.\n\nThere is good support at $1,440 and ETH may test this level before any sustained recover can be had. So far, the price action remains bearish and the resistance at $1,660 continues to hold strong.\n\nLooking ahead, ETH is in a downtrend and this latest breakdown puts sellers in charge with little hope of a reversal at this time.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nXRP has been consolidating since mid-August and has closed the week with a 2% profit. While this is not much, this price action looks much better than ETH and makes new lows unlikely.\n\nThe current support at 47 cents has held well twice so far and buyers came every time the price tested this level. The resistance is at 57 cents and has not been seriously tested yet.\n\nLooking ahead, XRP appears primed to try an escape from its current range. However, if the broad market remains bearish, this will be delayed until more favourable market conditions emerge.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano is also consolidating under the key resistance at 25 cents, but it is somewhat bearish right now after closing the week with a 2.5% loss.\n\nSellers rejected the attempt to break above the key resistance and pushed down the price back to the support at 24 cents. Buyers should be able to stop this pullback, but are not yet strong enough take ADA outside of this channel.\n\nLooking ahead, this cryptocurrency could end up in a similar situation like XRP and attempt to break out once market conditions improve. Until then, bulls have to to their best to keep the price above 24 cents.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nAfter escaping from its downtrend, Solana entered into a pullback which is now testing the breakout point found at $19. So long as this holds, the bias on is bullish and SOL also managed to close the week with a 2.7% increase.\n\nBuyers appear to be returning to Solana, but they have to hold the price above $19, otherwise sellers could take back control. The resistance at $20 also proved too difficult to break on the first attempt.\n\nLooking ahead, Solana has a good opportunity to return on a sustained uptrend. The most important leves at this time are $20 and $22.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance Coin is still trying to leave its current downtrend. There was an attempt on Monday and Tuesday, but sellers pushed back on that, which made BNB close the week with a 1% loss.\n\nAs long as the support at $206 continues to hold, buyers could try again to break away. For that to happen, the price has to move above $220 and not fall below.\n\nLooking ahead, BNB has a key resistance at $230 which will likely stop any rally, even if buyers will be successful at pushing the price above $220."
