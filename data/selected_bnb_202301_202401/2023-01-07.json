        "title": "PancakeSwap records few positive updates, but CAKE may topple soon - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "PanCakeSwap announced its latest proposal for adjustments to the Farm Rewards.\n\nA few of the metrics were supportive of a price surge for CAKE, while the indicators were bearish.\n\nOn 5 January, PancakeSwap [CAKE] updated the crypto community regarding its latest proposal for adjustments to the Farm Rewards. To clear the air, these adjustments do not reduce CAKE rewards to farms, so the per-block allocation to Farms and Lottery will remain at ~2.01 CAKE/block.\n\n\u2728Vote for free\u2728 We have a new farm rewards adjustment proposal for you to vote on. The goal is to redirect rewards to high value, high performing farms, giving us more capacity to bring new farms to the table. ? Vote now: https://t.co/wXEhXyXsNj pic.twitter.com/KiR9XgQaWw \u2014 PancakeSwap ? #Multichain (@PancakeSwap) January 5, 2023\n\nThe total amount of CAKE contributing to APR will be the same. The key difference this round is the adjustment of multipliers for CAKE farms, like CAKE-BNB, which currently has a flexible APR of about 19% and a boosted APR of 37%.\n\nHow many CAKEs can you get for $1?\n\nCAKE also was recognized in a dataset on 31 December, which showed that PancakeSwap ranked one on the list of the top 10 TVL on the BNB Chain as it accounted for over 50% of the total TVL. XVS and ALPACA grabbed the second and third spots on the same list, respectively.\n\nWas PancakeSwap affected?\n\nCAKE\u2019s price responded positively, as its weekly chart was painted green, unlike several other cryptos. According to CoinMarketCap, CAKE\u2019s price increased by nearly 3% over the last seven days, and at the time of writing, it was valued at $3.26 with a market capitalization of more than $530 million.\n\nA few of the metrics revealed what went in CAKE\u2019s favor and helped the token increase its price during the last few days. CAKE\u2019s MVRV Ratio registered a sharp uptick, which was a signal in the buyers\u2019 favor.\n\nCAKE\u2019s popularity has also increased lately as its social volume has gone up. Interestingly, CAKE ranked third on the list of cryptos on the BNB Chain in terms of social activity a few days ago.\n\nA concerning metric was that CAKE\u2019s velocity did not register an uptick over the last week, which might be troublesome.\n\nRead PancakeSwap\u2019s [CAKE] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nConcerns still persist\n\nOn one hand, the metrics looked optimistic, and on the other, the market indicators were suggesting otherwise. CAKE\u2019s Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon revealed a massive bearish advantage in the market as the 20-day EMA was resting way below the 55-day EMA.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained below the neutral mark, which looked bearish too. CAKE\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a downtick and was heading toward a neutral position, which might restrict CAKE\u2019s current uptrend."

        "content": "Just a week into the new year, and new meme coin Bonk Inu (BONK) has already grabbed eyeballs, this time on Solana.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to reward everyone that made #Solana what it is today,\u201d the team behind the Solana-focused meme coin, which went live on Dec. 25, wrote on Twitter early last month.\n\nThe total supply of the cryptocurrency is set to 100 trillion tokens, half of which were airdropped for free to the Solana community. Buzz surrounding the bounteous airdrop, combined with its developers burning all their tokens, led BONK to surge over 2,000% this week.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAbout 20% of the airdrop went to Solana NFT collections, 15% to early OpenBook traders, 10% to Solana artists and collectors, and 5% to Solana developers, according to the token\u2019s webpage. Its market cap is still tiny, around $77 million, so holders should expect volatility.\n\nThe Inu tokens are a brand of meme coin common across Ethereum and BNB Chain, with Dogecoin knock-off Shiba Inu the premiere example. Token holding binds a meme coin community inspired for potential gains, whether by buzz or by burning supply to boost scarcity.\n\nBonk Inu is porting crypto\u2019s long-running dog coin tradition over to Solana, albeit with a white paper with scant details on future tokenomics, which may raise red flags for some veteran crypto investors.\n\nBONK\u2019s price has retraced by about half from its recent peak, and it may well get worse from here. Source: Blockworks Research\n\nData shows unique BONK wallets have surged about 250% this week. Austin Federa, head of strategy and communications at Solana, has also expressed enthusiasm for the coin.\n\n\u201cWhy Bonk? Bonk is the first Solana dog coin for the people, by the people with 50% of the total supply airdropped to the Solana community,\u201d the project\u2019s site reads.\n\n\u201cThe Bonk contributors were tired of toxic \u2018Alameda\u2019 tokenomics and wanted to make a fun memecoin where everyone gets a fair shot.\u201d\n\nBONK airdrop provides great excuse to try Solana\n\nBut, those concerns aside, why shouldn\u2019t BONK be BONK? Solana has been hit negatively in the last two months for reasons including FTX\u2019s implosion. (Investors should however do their own research before buying BONK, or any meme coin.)\n\nFormer FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was a vocal cheerleader and proponent of the blockchain, which has added to concerns about projects leaving the Solana ecosystem.\n\nRead more: Q&A: A Conversation With Solana Founders Raj and Anatoly\n\nThe network\u2019s native token SOL plunged to single digits for the first time in nearly two years last week, weighed down by its ties to Bankman-Fried.\n\nHis trading firm Alameda Research invested in Solana Labs\u2019 initial coin offering for SOL and held about $1.2 billion in SOL tokens at the time questions surrounding its balance sheet surfaced.\n\nMoreover, two super popular NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, recently decided to abandon ship and move to rival blockchains Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nSource: BONK\n\nBut now BONK is appearing to gain steam with major platforms such as NFT marketplace Magic Eden hinting at adopting the token, even though it has only been around less than two weeks.\n\nSolana naturally benefits from increased usage of its network, with Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko sharing a tutorial on how to use decentralized exchange Orca to trade BONK via Twitter.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token SOL has risen up to 36% this past week, according to data from TradingView, having outperformed the market since the start of the year.\n\nSolana may not have fully recovered from its FTX-laden woes, and a dog-themed coin won\u2019t fix everything. But, apparently, it doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "NFTs: The future of monetization or just a fad? - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Art NFTs: These NFTs represent ownership of digital art, such as a painting, drawing, or photograph. Art NFTs can be created by artists, sold to collectors, or used as part of a larger product or service offering. Collectible NFTs: These are NFTs representing ownership of a collectible item, such as a virtual trading card or a digital toy. Collectible NFTs are often used as part of online games or a more extensive product or service offering. Virtual Real Estate NFTs: These are NFTs representing ownership of virtual real estate, such as a virtual land or building. Virtual real estate NFTs can be used as part of online games or a larger product or service offering. A flip side to virtual real estate NFTs is (real) real estate NFTs such as those being issued by upcoming PropTech player Hiraya Realty. Event NFTs: These are NFTs representing ownership of a ticket to a live event, such as a concert or sporting event. Event NFTs can be used to securely and digitally manage ticket sales and distribution. Gaming NFTs: These are the NFTs used as part of online games, such as virtual items or in-game currency. Players can buy and sell gaming NFTs to enhance gameplay or as part of a larger product or service offering. An example of such NFTs is those planned to be issued by Genblock Singapore.\n\nCreate and sell NFTs of your own artwork or other digital content. If you are an artist or creator, you can use NFTs to sell your work and retain ownership. You can create and list your NFTs on a marketplace such as OpenSea, Rarible, or SuperRare, and set the price you want to sell them for. If someone buys your NFT, you will receive the sale price minus any fees the marketplace charges. Another way to monetize NFTs is to license them for use in other projects. For example, if you have created an NFT of a piece of artwork, you could license it to be used in a video game, a movie, or a product. This can be an excellent way to generate ongoing revenue from your NFTs, as the license fee will be paid each time the NFT is used. Invest in NFTs created by other artists or content creators. If you are an investor, you can buy NFTs to diversify your portfolio and earn a return on your investment. You can research and evaluate the potential value of different NFTs based on factors such as the artist's reputation and the uniqueness of the content. Keep in mind that investing in NFTs carries risks, as the market is still relatively new, and the value of NFTs can fluctuate significantly. NFTs can also be used as part of a larger product or service offering. For example, you could create an NFT that grants access to a subscription service or a special event. You could also create an NFT that serves as a ticket to a concert or other live event. NFTs can be used as part of a fundraising campaign for a charitable cause or a personal or business project. For example, you could create an NFT that represents a donation to a charity and sell it to raise funds for the charity. Earn royalties from NFTs you have created. Royalty-bearing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that give the owner a share of the revenue generated from using the NFT. Royalty-bearing NFTs can be a good option for creators looking to monetize their work, as they can generate ongoing revenue from using their NFTs. They can also be attractive to buyers, as they may see the potential for long-term value in the NFT. For example, if an artist creates an NFT of a piece of artwork and sells it as a royalty-bearing NFT, the owner of the NFT may be entitled to a percentage of the revenue generated from the sale of prints or licensed use of the artwork. However, it is essential to carefully consider the terms of any royalty-bearing NFT before purchasing it. It is crucial to understand how the royalties will be calculated and paid and to ensure that the terms are fair and reasonable. It is also essential to be aware of any legal or regulatory considerations surrounding the use of royalty-bearing NFTs.Some NFT marketplaces offer the option to set up a royalty system, where you can earn a percentage of the sale price every time your NFT is resold. This can be an excellent way to continue earning income from your NFTs even after you have sold them.\n\nLack of regulation: The use of NFTs is not currently regulated by any central authority, making it difficult to protect your rights as a buyer or seller of NFTs. There is also a risk that NFTs could be used for illegal or fraudulent activities, such as money laundering or selling counterfeit items. Volatility: The value of NFTs can be highly volatile and may fluctuate significantly in a short period. This can make it difficult to accurately value an NFT and can result in significant losses if the value of the NFT declines. Lack of liquidity: NFTs are less widely accepted than traditional forms of currency, making it difficult to sell an NFT if you need to cash out. This lack of liquidity can also make it difficult to determine the fair market value of an NFT. Technical risks: There is a risk that the technology used to store and manage NFTs, such as the blockchain, could fail or be hacked. This could result in the loss or theft of your NFTs. Fraud: There is a risk that NFTs could be sold fraudulently or that the ownership of an NFT could be disputed. It is vital to carefully research any NFT you are considering buying and to only buy from reputable sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-fungible tokens, or NFTs , are digital assets that represent ownership of a unique item or piece of content, such as a digital artwork or collectible. They have gained popularity recently as a way for artists, collectors, and investors to buy and sell unique, digital items. They are stored on a blockchain and can be bought and sold like other assets, but they are not interchangeable because they are one-of-a-kind, hence the phrase \"Non-Fungible.\"Overall, there are many different types of NFTs, and the use cases for NFTs are constantly evolving. NFTs can be used in a variety of industries and can be used to represent ownership of a wide range of digital assets.There are several types of NFTs, including:To monetize NFTs successfully, it is crucial to have a clear plan and strategy in place. This may involve creating a solid marketing plan to promote your NFTs, making them visible to potential buyers, and establishing partnerships and relationships with other businesses or organizations interested in using or licensing your NFTs. It is also essential to clearly understand the legal and regulatory environment surrounding NFTs, as this can vary depending on the jurisdiction in which you operate.Overall, NFTs offer a unique and innovative way to monetize digital assets and can be a valuable tool for creators, businesses, and organizations looking to generate revenue from their digital creations. By understanding how NFTs can be monetized and developing a clear plan and strategy, you can effectively monetize your NFTs and generate ongoing revenue from your digital assets.It is essential to remember that making money using NFTs carries risks, as the market is still relatively new, and there are no guarantees about the value of NFTs. It is an excellent idea to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. Overall, it is crucial to be aware of the risks associated with using NFTs and carefully consider whether they are a suitable investment. It is also essential to be mindful of the legal and regulatory environment surrounding NFTs, as this can vary depending on the jurisdiction in which you operate."
