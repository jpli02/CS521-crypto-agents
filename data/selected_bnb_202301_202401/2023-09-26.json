        "content": "Donkey Is Welcoming Fans into 'Shrek\u2019s Swamp' on Airbnb this Halloween \u2014 See Inside!\n\nCalling all ogre enthusiasts, Shrek's home is available for booking on Oct. 13\n\nThis Halloween, Donkey has you covered!\n\nDreamWorks\u2019 lovable sidekick is letting you vacation in Shrek\u2019s Swamp! Guests of the animated early 2000s classic Shrek can soon call the ogre\u2019s stumpy, secluded haven home thanks to Airbnb.\n\nDonkey will be house-sitting for his trusty companion, and has decided to open up the Swamp doors for an exclusive two-night swamp stay for up to three friends from Oct. 27-29, 2023.\n\nThe mud-laden, moss-covered, murky-watered oasis that is Shrek\u2019s Swamp is nestled in the hills of the Scottish Highlands.\n\nThis charming and cozy refuge is the perfect secluded spot to enjoy a brisk autumn day and starry nights to hibernate like a true ogre would. The live-in tree stump features a studio layout with two beds and one bathroom.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nAlix McIntosh Shrek House Air Bnb, Bed\n\nAlthough there are signs labeled \u201cDanger,\u201d \u201cStay Out,\u201d and \u201cBeware Ogre\u201d that lead up to the Swamp house, think of it as Shrek\u2019s way of welcoming you home.\n\nThe property is a perfectly snug spot to escape from village life and embrace the beauty of nature.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted to invite you in for a fairytale stay,\u201d Donkey said in a description of the listing posted to Airbnb.\n\nAlix McIntosh Shrek House Air Bnb, Dining Room\n\nWhile vacationing in the Swamp, guests will have the chance to stay up late, swap stories, and eat like an ogre \u2014 because in the morning, Donkey\u2019s making waffles!\n\nThis will be the first time fans are welcomed into Shrek\u2019s humble abode and in true ogre fashion, the toilet, sink and shower facilities will be located off-site, approximately 20 meters away from Shrek\u2019s Swamp.\n\nAlix McIntosh Shrek House Air Bnb, Outhouse\n\n\u201cShrek\u2019s Swamp is lovely. Just beautiful. The perfect place to entertain guests,\u201d Donkey said. \u201cYou know what I like about it? Everything. The overgrown landscaping, the modest interiors, the nice boulders, all of it. I can\u2019t wait for guests to experience this muddy slice of paradise for themselves.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that staying at Shrek\u2019s Swamp isn\u2019t a contest! Any fan of the ogre can stay for just \u00a30 a night \u2014 a nod to the priceless refuge he has provided fairytale creatures of all kinds!\n\nRelated: There's an Official 'Hocus Pocus' Airbnb! Kathy Najimy Reveals the 'Spooky, Fantastic' Salem Cottage's Secrets\n\nHowever, those interested will have to abide by a few simple rules.\n\nGuests at Shrek\u2019s Swamp must have an active Airbnb profile with a good track record on the platform, own a government-issued ID, and be at least 5 years of age, in addition to several other terms and conditions.\n\nSince this isn\u2019t a contest, guests are responsible for their own travel to and from Scotland.\n\nThe wildly popular franchise featured Mike Myers as the voice of Shrek, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona.\n\nRelated: 'Shrek' Reboot in Works with Original Cast in Negotiations to Return: 'There's Tremendous Enthusiasm'\n\nTo honor good childhood memories that last a lifetime, Airbnb will make a one-time donation to HopScotch Children\u2019s Charity, which provides some of Scotland\u2019s most vulnerable and disadvantaged children with respite breaks through nurturing and dynamic holiday trips.\n\nOnion and ogre enthusiasts can request to book Shrek\u2019s Swamp beginning Oct. 13 at 6 p.m. BST at airbnb.com/shrek.\n\nShrek\u2019s Swamp isn\u2019t the only mega movie mansion that\u2019s been up for grabs as of late.\n\nEarlier this year, Airbnb reopened the doors to the Barbie Dream House in Malibu ahead of the iconic doll\u2019s July 21 feature film release!\n\nAirbnb/Hogwash Studios Barbie's Malibu Dreamhouse up for rent on Airbnb\n\nIn stark contrast to the ogre\u2019s unique stay, visitors of Barbie\u2019s multilevel pink home enjoyed a disco dance floor, a roller rink, a gym, a bar and grill, and an infinity pool (adorned with floats that spell out Ken\u2019s name, of course).\n\nHowever, like Shrek\u2019s Swamp, those staying at the Malibu mansion were also able to do so at no cost to them \u201cbecause Ken couldn\u2019t figure out how to put a price on Barbie\u2019s Malibu Dream House \u2014 after all, Ken\u2019s thing is beach, not math!\u201d\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nRead the original article on People."

The analysis projects a two to three-year window before increased market competition potentially impacts Binance\u2019s standing.\n\nDespite the leadership transition, Binance Coin has shown resilience, marking 20 out of 30 days as bullish in the last month and exhibiting a 4.49% price volatility.
