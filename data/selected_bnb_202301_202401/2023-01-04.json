        "content": "How is Binance BNB Looking Today?\n\nBinance BNB is currently trading above $250 and is finally gaining momentum on the lower timeframes. As mentioned in our previous analyses, the price faced resistance around the $250 mark and struggled to break above it on lower timeframes. Right now, we can see bullishness for BNB as the price managed to form a big green candle on the 4-hour timeframe earlier this morning. This move can also invite more trading volume, and we can expect further upside movement in the short term.

The structure is now playing out, and BNB has broken above the resistance at $250.\n\nA symmetrical triangle is a neutral pattern that indicates that the price is being squeezed and could break out in either direction.\n\nBNB has broken towards the upside and its target, according to the structure, is around the $260 mark. The target was almost met with the first breakout candle on the 4-hour timeframe.\n\nOn the other hand, we can also notice that the trading volume is low. If the trading volume for BNB does not improve, BNB could drop below $250 again.\n\nIt is possible that the volume will start increasing because of the current breakout. Once BNB manages to break above $260, we can expect further continuation towards the upside.\n\nConclusion: Final Verdict on Binance BNB\n\nBNB is looking quite bullish at the moment as it is gaining momentum on the lower timeframes. If the volumes flow in the coming hours, we can expect the price to go above $260 once again. An increase in volume would be a promising sign, and we will be interested in placing a long trade on BNB if that happens. Right now, we will just be watching the price closely.\n\nMargin Trading for Beginners\n\nIf you are interested in leverage trading Bitcoin, you can go through our Margin Trading Guide to learn more about it.

        "content": "A closely followed crypto trader says now may be the time to keep an eye on peer-to-peer payments network Litecoin (LTC).\n\nThe pseudonymous trader known as Cantering Clark tells his 156,000 Twitter followers that LTC is forming a structural pattern that previously signaled bottoms and reversals.\n\nCantering Clark\u2019s chart shows LTC bouncing off a support level at around $71.\n\n\u201cIs Litecoin about to wow everyone? I haven\u2019t looked at this since the baby came, and when I did I was expecting a breakdown.\n\nInstead there is a lot of structural and trend similarity to a prior bottom. Difference is context and an unforgiving environment for risk. Will it care?\u201d\n\nThe trader sees similar opportunities in Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. He says that the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) that Binance faced in previous weeks regarding its solvency is in the past, and that BNB should benefit from increased confidence.\n\n\u201c[Eyes] on BNB \u2013 Binance fud is mostly out of the narrative.\n\nHistorically a strong pair against BTC and ETH, so maybe we see some strength and return back to prior norms.\n\nThe R:R (risk to reward) for a long here on a breakout of the last 2 week range is well defined & failure sets up a good short\u2026\n\nELI5 (Explain like I\u2019m 5):\n\nWe are in a contextually attractive area to define short term bias for both directions. If the long is invalidated by losing something like 253, then an attractive short opportunity with risk defined above today\u2019s high sets up.\u201d\n\nLast week, the popular trader said that Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) was showing signs of a bottom.\n\n\u201cLooks like the market might actually be a bit crowded here. I think that my own interpretation of calling for another 50% drop along with everyone else calling for $3 might be the signal that this thing is completely one-sided and potentially bottoming here for the near future.\u201d\n\nSo far, the crypto trader\u2019s call on Solana has been accurate. At time of writing, SOL is trading at $13.48, over 62% from its low of $8.30.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Analyst Predicts Rallies for Chainlink, Polkadot, Binance Coin and Two Additional Altcoins \u2013 Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "Popular crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is predicting rallies for Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), Binance Coin (BNB), Cosmos (ATOM) and SKALE (SKL).\n\nIn a new YouTube strategy session, Van de Poppe tells his 163,000 subscribers that Chainlink is likely to rally after the decentralized oracle network first dips by as much as 20%.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably going to see a case where things like Chainlink are going to bottom out around $4.50 to $5. It\u2019s really close, I believe. And then we get a relief rally somewhere in 2023 taking place towards [about $17].\u201d\n\nAt time of writing Chainlink is changing hands at $5.62.\n\nNext, he says Polkadot could surge by as much as 432% from its current value of $4.51 at time of writing.\n\n\u201cI think that if we are in for a relief rally that one of those assets to add to the portfolio is definitely going to be Polkadot, given the fact that Polkadot is going to pretty much bring a rally towards the levels that we have here between $16 to $24.\u201d\n\nVan de Poppe says Cosmos is already rallying and is likely to continue to surge.\n\n\u201cWe have had this retest at the high taking place. We\u2019ve had a run to the highs and now we\u2019re consolidating again. I think that once it cracks the high again [at $25.97] we\u2019re going to have some sort of run-up taking place towards this block [up to about $35.00] as a relief rally just like we have been seeing in 2019 and 2020.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Cosmos is changing hands at $10.10.\n\nHe next says that the native token of the crypto exchange Binance is finding support at its current price level. Looking at van de Poppe\u2019s chart, he predicts BNB will surge to $400 by June.\n\n\u201cWe are into support level at $233, which makes me believe that if Bitcoin is not going to fall too much at this point, it\u2019s not a bad case to have the biggest exchange in your portfolio given the simple case that it\u2019s going to be a bigger winner even when the markets are going to turn around.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, BNB is valued at $245.71.\n\nLastly, he says SKALE will continue moving up if it breaks a key price level of $0.0250.\n\n\u201cIf it starts to break $0.025, it\u2019s going to take out all these highs and start rallying quite fast towards [$0.200], which is, essentially, if you allocate it in a small portfolio, it could be an 8x to 12x during this year.\u201d\n\nSKALE is changing hands at $0.0211 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
