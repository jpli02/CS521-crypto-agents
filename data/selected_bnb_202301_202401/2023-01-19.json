The funds were raised in the stablecoin USDT at a valuation of 10M.\n\nEZ Fi is Aptos and Sui\u2019s very first leveraged yield farming protocol. A total of 3 parties play an essential role in EZ Fi: Lenders, Yield farmers, and Liquidators. Users can begin yield farming with just one type of asset. EZ Fi gives you the option to supply any combination of assets without having to supply an equal amount of assets for a liquidity pool like traditional yield farming.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to bring leveraged yield farming to MOVE Ecosystem. This is essential to the future development of DEFI-related products and EZ FI is here to minimize risk and bring more value to users.\u201d Matthew, Co-Founder of EZ Finance said."
