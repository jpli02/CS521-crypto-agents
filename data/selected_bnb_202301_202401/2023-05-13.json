        "content": "OKX Wallet has announced the launch of its new platform, Cryptopedia, and its partnership with protocols, Radiant and Marinade. This announcement would come following wide discussions about the waning influence of Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nOKX Launches Cryptopedia; Partners With Radiant And Marinade\n\nIn a GlobeNewswire press release dated May 13th, 2023, OKX Wallet disclosed the launch of Cryptopedia, a Web3 learn-to-earn and airdrop platform. This new platform aims to help users easily identify and access Web3 projects and dApps. Cryptopedia will also enable users to unlock additional airdrops and gain extra rewards.\n\nThe first Cryptopedia issue, which is focused on the zkSync theme, provides users with the opportunity to receive zkSync airdrops and other related airdrops. Users will also have the chance to collect non-fungible tokens jointly created by OKX Wallet and zkSync.\n\nzkSync is a Layer-2 scaling solution designed to enhance transaction speed and reduce cost on the Ethereum network. As the name suggests, this protocol is based on the zero-knowledge (zk) concept.\n\nIn the press release, OKX Wallet also announced its partnership with two protocols, namely Radiant and Marinade. Its collaboration with Radiant, a decentralized lending protocol native to Arbitrum and BNB Chain, will allow users to access Radiant\u2019s lending service via the OKX Wallet plug-in and Discover platform.\n\nWith Radiant, users are able to borrow a variety of digital assets across multiple chains against their own assets on one chain.\n\nMarinade, on the other hand, is a non-custodial liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocol on the Solana network. Similar to Radiant, this partnership will facilitate users\u2019 access to Marinade\u2019s liquidity staking service via the OKX Wallet plug-in and Discover platform.\n\nOKB Shows No Significant Price Action\n\nThe OKB coin is the utility token of the OKX ecosystem. From trading fee discounts to passive income, there are a few benefits that holders of this token get to enjoy. And it appears that the growth of the OKX ecosystem has some links to OKB price.\n\nThat said, it is somewhat too early to tell what the impact of these partnerships will be on the price of OKB. Moreover, there has been no significant price movement in the OKB market since the announcement was made.\n\nA broader look at price action reveals that the OKB market has been moving sideways in the last few weeks. According to data from CoinGecko, the token\u2019s value dipped by a measly 2.1% in the past seven days. As of this writing, an OKB coin changes hands at $44.82, tallying only a 2.6% price rise in the last 24 hours.\n\nOKBUSD trading at $44.821 | Source: OKBUSD chart from TradingView\n\nRelated Reading"

        "content": "Published: 5:10 am EDT May 13, 2023 Published: May 13, 2023 Updated: 6:23 am EDT May 13, 2023\n\nThe inn has stood in Bucks County for many years.\n\nThe Inn at Bowman\u2019s Hill, a bed and breakfast in New Hope nestled on five lovely acres, just hit the market for $4.5 million. Emma Dooling wrote about the estate for the Philadelphia Business Journal.\n\nThe 518 Lurgan Road lot is being marketed as a single-family property. Current owner Michael Amery bought the site and opened the bed and breakfast nearly two decades ago. The Inn at Bowman\u2019s Hill has a AAA Four Diamond rating, which is given to properties with \u201cupscale style and amenities enhanced with the right touch of service.\u201d\n\nAmery put the property up for sale after deciding it was time for him to retire. Whether the property will continue to operate as an inn or is converted to a residence depends solely on the buyer, he said.\n\nBuilt in 1978, the three-story manor has 12 bedrooms, 12 full and two half bathrooms, a heated in-ground pool, and gardens. The property is also home to a four-bedroom carriage house and six oversized garages.\n\nLaurie Madaus and Chris Preston with Kurfiss Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\n\nRead more about The Inn at Bowman\u2019s Hill in the Philadelphia Business Journal.\n\n_____"
