        "content": "The reserves display the asset backing, and strength, of Binance, which may cushion outflows from the exchange at a time when some fear an FTX repeat. Binance has, as of Wednesday, had over $600 million in customer token outflows, although the figure is still relatively lower than when BUSD-issued Paxos was slapped by the New York State Department of Financial Services earlier this year. Binance processed over $2 billion in withdrawals in a single day at the time."

In April 2022, YouTuber Coffeezilla published two videos looking into the project\u2019s troubles, some of which predated Karony\u2019s tenure.\n\nIn regard to the current incident, blockchain security firm PeckShield tweeted that the code that was exploited \u2013 a \u201cpublic burn bug\u201d \u2013 was introduced by the official SafeMoon deployer.\n\n\u201cThe upgrade, with the exploited public burn bug, was initiated by the official SafeMoon: Deployer. (Admin key leak?),\u201d PeckShield said.\n\nData from BscScan indicates that the exploiter\u2019s wallet transferred the funds to a second wallet, which sent a message to the SafeMoon deployer, saying \u201cHey relax, we are accidently frontrun an attack against you, we would like to return the fund, setup secure communication channel , lets talk\u201d.\n\nUpon news breaking about the incident, the SFM token\u2019s value dropped by about 30%, according to CoinGecko, though it has since regained some of that loss."

        "title": "Collateral Network (COLT) Surges Forward as Concerns Mount Among Binance (BNB) and Ripple (XRP) Investor - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "As concerns mount among investors of major cryptocurrencies such as Binance (BNB) and Ripple (XRP), Collateral Network (COLT)'s innovative approach has sparked interest and attracted a growing number of early investors. In this article, we will explore the features of Collateral Network (COLT) and why it has been gaining traction in the ongoing presale. With the current price of the COLT token at $0.01 this project has a lot of upside potential.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is a revolutionary platform that enables individuals to access funds by using their physical assets as collateral. While traditional lending institutions often require a lengthy and cumbersome application process, Collateral Network (COLT) simplifies borrowing by providing a streamlined and efficient solution that leverages blockchain technology and asset backed NFTs.\n\nThe real USP of Collateral Network (COLT) is the minting of NFTs that represent the physical version of the asset. These NFTs are then fractionalized into smaller segments and can then be used to secure loans from the community against the asset. When the loan is paid back in full the NFTs are burned and the asset is returned to the original borrower.\n\nThe innovative way of bringing off-chain assets on-chain is great for both borrowers and lenders. Borrowers can unlock cash for their assets from anybody in the world without being restricted to a specific location. The cash can be provided as quickly as 24 hours discreetly without impacting their credit file. By providing a facility where multiple people can fund the loans, borrowers on the platform now have access to institutional level liquidity.\n\nLenders on the other hand have the opportunity to be part of the lucrative lending market and earn a passive income by developing their own book of loans and essentially becoming their own bank.\n\nWith its innovative approach to lending, Collateral Network (COLT) could potentially revolutionize the billion-dollar lending industry. The best part is that COLT tokens can be purchased for a discount of only $0.01 during phase 1 of the ongoing presale, representing an attractive opportunity for early investors.\n\nHowever you better be quick as the tokens available at this price are being snapped up quickly.\n\nBinance (BNB)\n\nBinance (BNB) is a unique cryptocurrency exchange that has quickly become a leader in the digital currency industry. Binance (BNB)'s founder, Changpeng Zhao, has been at the forefront of many innovative initiatives, including the creation of Binance Coin (BNB), which is used as the exchange's native cryptocurrency.\n\nBinance (BNB) has also expanded its offerings to include an NFT marketplace, DEX, and stablecoin. This has helped to solidify Binance (BNB)'s position as a leading player in the cryptocurrency industry and has attracted a diverse user base of investors and traders from around the world.\n\nHowever, Binance (BNB) has also faced its share of challenges, including regulatory scrutiny from the US SEC over allegations of selling unregistered securities. While this investigation could impact Binance (BNB)'s future growth in the US market, the exchange remains committed to providing its users with innovative products and services.\n\nBinance (BNB) will survive this legal challenge and continue to be a major player in the industry, but there's no denying that Binance (BNB) investors should be aware of the implications of this investigation.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nRipple (XRP) is a cryptocurrency that was developed in order to facilitate faster, cheaper international payments. Ripple (XRP) has gained widespread attention since its launch in 2012 due to its promise to revolutionize the banking sector.\n\nHowever, Ripple (XRP) is another coin to face scrutiny from the sec, as the regulator has filed a lawsuit against Ripple (XRP)'s parent company, alleging that it violated securities laws in its sale of XRP tokens. This situation has caused some investors to become concerned about their Ripple (XRP) holdings, especially as Ripple (XRP) has not returned to the all-time price of $3.84 in five years.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this situation will pan out, but in the meantime, many investors are looking for other options that offer more stability and security. One such option is Collateral Network (COLT), which has seen a surge of interest from these Ripple (XRP) holders as they look to diversify their portfolios.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk"
