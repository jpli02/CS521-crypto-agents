        "content": "WEB3\n\nInQubeta offers an alternative way to invest in artificial intelligence, bypassing traditional investment firm requirements.\n\nLook no further than the Binance Coin (BNB), InQubeta (QUBE), and Synthetic (SNX) if you\u2019re looking for the best cryptocurrency to buy today. BNB prices have grown 19% in the month, helping to erase a large portion of its losses since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed 13 charges against the Binance exchange.\n\nSNX investors have watched the value of their portfolios grow by 30% in the last 30 days, while QUBE prices have surged 130% since its presale started.\n\nInQubeta takes on conventional investment avenues by providing an alternative way to invest in artificial intelligence (AI). It allows investors to skirt the rigorous requirements many traditional investment firms have, like angel investors having to prove earning over $200,000 for more than two years for access to investment opportunities.\n\nBest cryptocurrency to buy today: InQubeta (QUBE) set for 310% growth before launch on exchanges\n\nThe InQubeta presale has exceeded expectations so far, raising over $4.7 million as investors rush at the opportunity to be part of the AI revolution. Investor interest in platforms that help to advance artificial intelligence is currently at an all-time high as investments have grown 12x from 2015 to today. More than $120 billion is now invested in AI and over $1.5 trillion will be directed into the technology in the next several years.\n\nAI\u2019s viability has increased exponentially in the past decade and it\u2019s no longer some interesting sci-fi concept that many people never expected to become a reality in their lifetimes. AI is now all around us, from AI-powered voice recognition tools on our smart devices to humanoid robots being tested in Amazon warehouses.\n\nAutomation will lead to drastic changes worldwide as governments, people, and societies adapt to the new world created by artificial intelligence. It will also create many opportunities for investors to earn tremendous returns. InQubeta aims to open up these investments with its Ethereum-built blockchain, ERC20 coins, and fractionalization.\n\nHere\u2019s how InQubeta creates a secure and transparent investment process on its blockchain:\n\nAI startups can secure funding for their projects by developing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with investment opportunities minted into them. Think of these ERC20 coins as InQubeta\u2019s alternative to stocks. They perform similar functions and offer rewards like discounts and profit-sharing\n\nas InQubeta\u2019s alternative to stocks. They perform similar functions and offer rewards like discounts and profit-sharing The tokens made by startups are assessed by InQubeta\u2019s operations team before being listed on the ERC20 token list\n\nInvestors are provided with all the information they need to make smart investment choices on the NFT marketplace and tokens are bought with QUBE. Investors can acquire QUBE with top crypto coins or fiat currencies\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) enjoys first substantial surge since SEC lawsuit thanks to increased demand\n\nBNB prices have surged 19% after months of consistent losses since the SEC filed charges against its parent exchange. Prices have gone as high as $257 during its current run and support has been found at $243 as prices pull back.\n\nMetrics like a retraced candle approaching the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement line indicate more growth will likely continue. The most impressive part of BNB\u2019s recent growth is the fact it has occurred with lots of uncertainty surrounding the ecosystem due to its legal issues.\n\nSynthetix (SNX) building up momentum\n\nSynthetix hosts a decentralized liquidity protocol that has multiple uses. Its low fees and deep liquidity allows investors to stake tokens on the Ethereum and Optimism networks without losing liquidity. Prices could almost double if highs set in early 2023 are reclaimed.\n\nSummary\n\nQUBE, SNX, and BNB are three of the best cryptocurrencies to buy today. QUBE leads the trio regarding growth potential thanks to the price structure of its presale that offers 3x returns and the exponential growth it's expected to enjoy post-launch.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

        "title": "Introducing Popular New Meme Coin With Greater Growth Than Polygon, Shiba Inu & BNB - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "WEB3\n\nWith its deflationary model and dual utility, NUGX offers more appeal to the memecoin community.\n\nTLDR:\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) is a leading memecoin that is quickly gaining recognition across the board.\n\nThe lack of utility in most popular memecoin projects is a huge concern, so NuggetRush is launching a play-to-earn (P2E) game integrating crypto through its ERC-20 coin, NUGX.\n\nThe renewed interest in NUGX coincides with tapering demand for competing memecoins, especially SHIB, and investors exploring alternatives besides BNB and MATIC.\n\nIn crypto, especially the fast-moving memecoin scene, it can be challenging to pin down the next top gainer. However, this shouldn't be the reason for disenfranchisement. If anything, the industry is full of opportunities, as shown by the sharp gains of Bitcoin and Ethereum over the years.\n\nPresently, NuggetRush (NUGX) is one of the leading memecoins, even billed as a top altcoin worth considering, that is quickly gaining recognition across the board, outperforming other best altcoins like Polygon (MATIC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and BNB.\n\nMultiple factors could be driving the impressive performance of NuggetRush, but mainly because the project aims to improve and add value to the memecoin industry that's currently worth billions of dollars, led by Dogecoin (DOGE), the first true meme-inspired altcoin.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nWhy is NuggetRush Rallying?\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) creators saw a major problem with memecoins. Though the industry is worth billions, with the potential for even more growth as the sphere evolves and adjusts to emerging, secondary factors, the lack of utility in most popular memecoin projects is a huge concern.\n\nSubsequently, the project is taking a new approach and is launching a play-to-earn (P2E) game integrating crypto through its ERC-20 coin, NUGX.\n\nThe token plays a duo-role in that it will be used as a utility, impacting things like in-platform payments and more. At the same time, token holders will vote on proposals floated by members to progressively improve the project over time.\n\nNUGX is also deflationary. This model is deliberate; like Ethereum's approach, following the activation of EIP-1559, more NUGX will be burnt, effectively moved out of circulation.\n\nAnalysts say this will positively support prices in the long haul, benefitting early adopters in the ongoing presale, while also making it the best crypto to buy in 2023. In Round 2, NUGX is up 20%, each trading at 0.012 USDT.\n\nBeyond tokenomics, the incorporation of charity and the maintenance of community focus are other drivers making NuggetRush one of the top crypto projects to invest in Q4 2023.\n\nOf note, NuggetRush creators have revealed that the platform's smart contracts have been audited and proven to be secure.\n\nThat means users who rely on the platform, playing games and receiving in-game assets availed as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are confident that the team won't rug-pull them as the protocol gains traction, drawing millions, if not billions, in total value locked (TVL).\n\nOver the coming months, the team will renounce NuggetRush's smart contracts, allowing the team to take charge of spearheading development.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nNUGX Leading The Altcoin Charge, What's Going On?\n\nThe renewed interest in NUGX, especially in the ongoing presale, coincides with tapering demand for competing memecoins, especially SHIB, and investors exploring alternatives besides BNB and MATIC. Even with Shibarium, SHIB is struggling to replicate the momentum of the last bull run.\n\nRegulatory pressures on Binance have impacted BNB, forcing the coin lower and capping upsides. Accordingly, holders are actively seeking high-growth, low-market-cap options to diversify and cushion themselves from stunted growth.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the success of zkEVM and a growing number of projects using Polygon's layer-2 infrastructure, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleges that MATIC is an unregistered security.\n\nConclusion\n\nNUGX's growth potential shows in the current NuggetRush (NUGX) presale, making it the best crypto for beginners. Presently, millions of tokens have been sold, helping the project raise over $300,000.\n\nIf this momentum is sustained, this memecoin project shows that it can rally faster than competitors, including SHIB, and even outperform established altcoins like BNB and MATIC. Subsequently, more investors are closely monitoring the memecoin, with some accumulating the token at spot rates.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website"

        "content": "For the first time in many years, one of the grandest buildings in Cooktown has opened its doors to the public as a cafe and bed and breakfast.\n\nFormer NSW couple Darren and Tania Taylor bought the old bank building at 122 Charlotte Street last year and are now open to the public from 8 am to 2 pm Monday to Friday.\n\n\u201cWe live out the back, the upstairs is a B&B and we have a cafe and gift shop downstairs,\u201d Ms Taylor said.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to open the doors so people can come in and have a look, we have the strongroom opened, some bits and pieces of gold stuff around.\u201d\n\nMs Taylor said the couple had \u201ccollected junk\u201d for years, and had enjoyed filling the huge building with antiques.\n\n\u201cHow can you not love [the Old Bank]?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cIt is the quiet season, so tourists aren\u2019t around, but the locals are utilising it. We have groups coming in for a cup of tea and chatting for an hour or so and when the rain starts it\u2019ll be lovely to have somewhere dry and air-conditioned.\u201d\n\nThe building, affectionately known by locals as the Old Bank, has been a familiar sight on Cooktown\u2019s main street since 1891, when it was built as the Queensland National Bank.\n\nThe two-storey structure features an impressive arched entrance, high ceilings, pillared verandahs and magnificent red cedar counters.\n\nIt was Cooktown\u2019s Westpac Bank until the early 2000s, and has since been leased for a variety of uses, including as a community hub, and residential and natural resource management office."
