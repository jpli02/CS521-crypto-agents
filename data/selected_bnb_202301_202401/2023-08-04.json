        "content": "Binance Labs, the venture capital and incubation arm of Binance, has announced its investment in four top-performing projects from the sixth season of its Most Valuable Builder (MVB) program. The announcement was made on Binance's official blog, and the investment is aimed at growing the BNB Chain ecosystem.\n\nThe four projects selected for investment are:\n\n1. AltLayer: An open and decentralized protocol for developers to launch application-tailored rollups. It offers a no-code Rollups-as-a-Service dashboard that allows customized rollups with fraud/zk proofs at speed.\n\n2. KiloEx: Building the next generation of user-friendly perpetual DEX focused on risk management and capital efficiency. It offers lightning-fast trades and an intuitive trading experience.\n\n3. Kinza: A robust lending protocol that focuses on security and aims to create the best on-chain money market. It features Real Yield that employs a dynamic interest rate curve, generating revenue from interest for the protocol and lenders.\n\n4. Sleepless AI: An AI blockchain-based virtual companion game utilizing AIGC and LLMs to create rich story-based gameplay and evolving interactions with characters.\n\nThese projects are building across various sectors including DeFi, infrastructure, and Web3 gaming.\n\nYi He, Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs, commented on the investment, stating: \"At Binance Labs, our vision is to empower and back early-stage founders who are committed to building long-term innovative projects. Through the MVB Program, we identified four high-performing projects for investment across various sectors. We look forward to seeing these projects\u2019 continued growth and positive contribution to the wider Web3 ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe sixth season of the MVB Program concluded in June 2023. It received over 1,400 applications, with 53% of applicants based in North America and Europe, and 36% based in APAC. The program's highly selective process admitted less than 1% of the total applicant pool.\n\nSince 2018, Binance Labs has invested in more than 200 projects across six continents with $9 billion in total assets and a 1260% rate of return on investment. It has also incubated more than 50 projects native to Web3, including Polygon, Perpetual Protocol, and Dune Analytics.\n\nBNB Chain is a decentralized blockchain powered by BNB. It has processed 3 billion transactions to date from 200 million unique addresses. The ecosystem has more than 1,400 active dApps across multiple categories, such as DeFi, Metaverse, blockchain games, NFT, and more.\n\nThe investment in these four projects by Binance Labs signifies a strong commitment to supporting innovation and meaningful use cases within the Web3 industry. It also reflects Binance Labs' dedication to incubating and supporting high-potential projects that contribute to the sustainability and scalability of the Web3 ecosystem. Applications for the new season of the Binance Labs Incubation Program are open until August 15th, 2023.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock\n\n. . .\n\nTags"

        "content": "Today we issued our second quarter 2023 financial results. You can read the details here. Airbnb Co-Founder and CEO Brian Chesky said:\n\n\u201cOur Q2 results show the desire to travel and host on Airbnb remains strong. We had over 115 million nights and experiences booked and added a record number of new listings \u2013 ending Q2 with over 7 million total active listings. We also saw 18% year-over-year revenue growth and Free Cash Flow of $900 million.\u201d\n\nOverview of Q2 results\n\nQ2 marked another quarter of strong results for Airbnb. Nights and Experiences Booked exceeded 115 million. Revenue of $2.5 billion grew 18% year-over-year (19% ex-FX). Net income was $650 million\u2014our most profitable Q2 on a GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $819 million, while Free Cash Flow was $900 million, growing 13% year-over-year.\n\nWe also continued to make significant progress across each of our strategic priorities:\n\nMake hosting mainstream: Supply growth stagnated at the beginning of COVID. Since then, we\u2019ve been focused on making hosting mainstream by raising awareness, making it easier and improving our tools. Through these efforts, we\u2019ve seen great results. In Q2 2023, active listings grew 19% year-over-year, with strong growth across all regions, market types and price points. In fact, we added more net active listings than in any previous quarter in Airbnb\u2019s history to exceed 7 million total active listings.\n\nSupply growth stagnated at the beginning of COVID.

Perfect the core service: We want people to love our service, and that means obsessing over every detail. Millions of people have given us feedback on how to improve Airbnb. We\u2019ve listened. Based on feedback from our community, we introduced over 50 new features and upgrades as part of our 2023 Summer Release. For example, we introduced several initiatives aimed at increasing affordability, including new pricing tools for Hosts. Since the Release, more Hosts have adopted our discounting tools and lowered their prices.\n\nWe want people to love our service, and that means obsessing over every detail.

Since the Release, more Hosts have adopted our discounting tools and lowered their prices. Expand beyond the core: We\u2019ve spent the last few years perfecting our core service. Today, it\u2019s stronger and more profitable than ever. But we\u2019re not stopping there. We have some big ideas for where to take Airbnb next, and we\u2019re building the foundational capabilities for new products and services that we plan to launch in the years to come.\n\nQ2 2023 financial results\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of our Q2 2023 results:\n\nQ2 revenue was $2.5 billion, up 18% (19% ex-FX) year-over-year. Revenue increased to $2.5 billion in Q2 2023 from $2.1 billion in Q2 2022, driven by solid growth in Nights and Experiences Booked and stable Average Daily Rate (\u201cADR\u201d).\n\nQ2 net income was $650 million, up 72% year-over-year. Net income increased to $650 million in Q2 2023 from $379 million in Q2 2022 primarily due to our revenue growth, expense discipline and interest income. In Q2 2023, we delivered a net income margin of 26% \u2013 our highest second quarter ever \u2013 up from 18% in Q2 2022.\n\nQ2 Adjusted EBITDA was $819 million, up 15% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $819 million in Q2 2023 from $711 million in Q2 2022. This demonstrates the continued strength of our business and discipline in managing our cost structure. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33% compared to Q2 2022 EBITDA margin of 34%1.\n\nQ2 Free Cash Flow was $900 million, up 13% year-over-year. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $909 million in Q2 2023 from $801 million in Q2 2022. The increase in cash flow was driven by revenue and bookings growth as well as net margin expansion. Our TTM FCF was $3.9 billion, representing a TTM FCF margin of 43% \u2013 a significant improvement from 39% a year ago2.\n\nQ2 TTM share repurchases of $2.5 billion. Our TTM Free Cash Flow generation enabled us to repurchase $2.5 billion of our Class A common stock over the trailing twelve months. In total, our share repurchases since the start of our buyback program in August 2022 have helped to reduce our fully diluted share count from 705 million in Q2 2022 to 686 million at the end of Q2 2023.\n\nBusiness highlights\n\nOur strong quarter was driven by a number of positive business trends:\n\nGuest demand on Airbnb remains strong. Nights and Experiences Booked grew 11% in Q2 2023 compared to a relatively hard comparison a year ago. We saw an improvement in year-over-year Nights and Experiences Booked growth during the quarter from 10% in April to 15% in June. In particular, we were encouraged by the acceleration in year-over-year nights in North America throughout the quarter, and the recovery in EMEA in June following challenging holiday comparisons in May. In the quarter, we saw active bookers growth in every region, as well as more first time bookers compared to a year ago. Since starting Airbnb, we\u2019ve had more than 1.5 billion guest arrivals.\n\nGuests are traveling farther. Cross-border nights booked grew by 16% in Q2 2023 compared to a year ago. While the mix of international travel hasn\u2019t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, we\u2019ve continued to see strong year-over-year growth across all regions. In particular, cross-border travel to Asia Pacific grew over 80% in Q2 2023 compared to the same period a year ago, while cross-border travel to North America increased by 20%. We also saw more guests return to cities, with high-density urban nights booked increasing by 13% in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022.\n\nGuests are staying longer on Airbnb. As part of our 2023 Summer Release on May 3, we launched several new features for long-term stays (28 nights or longer). Following the release, year-over-year growth in bookings for long-term stays accelerated every month during the quarter. Overall, nights from long-term stays were stable with the prior quarter at 18% of total gross nights booked in Q2 2023. For the past six quarters, long weekends have been the fastest growing trip type on Airbnb. As our guests continue to have flexibility to travel and work remotely, they\u2019re opting to stay an extra night or two on Airbnb."
