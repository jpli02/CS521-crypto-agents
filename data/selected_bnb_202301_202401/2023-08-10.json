        "title": "How fast are Binance\u2019s revenues falling? - Fortune",
        "content": "In early August, the Wall Street Journal issued a report that surprised sundry analysts and investors across the digital currency landscape: Despite China\u2019s ban on crypto sales, that nation remains by far the largest market for Binance, still the world\u2019s dominant exchange despite the recent onslaught from U.S. and overseas regulators. According to internal documents the story\u2019s authors reviewed, as well as information gleaned from current and former employees, Binance in May hosted $90 billion in trades for Chinese customers. The Journal\u2019s sources disclosed those transactions accounted for 20% of Binance\u2019s total volumes, dwarfing the intake for second-place South Korea ($55 billion), and third-ranked Turkey ($40 billion).\n\nThe Journal story broke important news in revealing China\u2019s crucial importance to Binance\u2019s business, long after Beijing first banned its site in 2017, and made all crypto trading illegal in 2021. But the findings also provide a potential guide in gauging Binance\u2019s annual revenues. Jiangsu-born chief Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao hasn\u2019t disclosed Binance\u2019s turnover for several years, and financial information on the exchange is so cloudy that analysts aren\u2019t even posting estimates.\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear that double hit from legal crackdowns targeting Binance and steep drop in overall trading of digital currencies has hammered the exchange\u2019s volumes. The mystery centers on whether the damage is so severe that Binance, which CZ declares is \u201cstill profitable,\u201d will soon start losing money. If Binance can\u2019t collect enough revenue to cover its rent, personnel, data center, compliance, and marketing costs, it will need to start exhausting its war chest to meet the shortfall. And its capital rests primarily in a self-issued, relatively little-traded coin that\u2014if Binance sells it to meet operating expenses\u2014is vulnerable to a deep dive that could rock the crypto world.\n\nBinance\u2019s shockingly low trading volumes\n\nThe Journal\u2019s finding that China\u2019s $90 billion in trading for May accounted for one-fifth of Binance\u2019s overall business implies that its volumes for the month totaled $450 billion. The story specifies that the $90 billion comprises both spot and futures transactions, the latter the most important contributor by far. Hence, on an annualized basis, Binance\u2019s sales would be running at around $5.4 trillion (12 months x $450 billion). This is an astoundingly low number that would signal a recent collapse in Binance\u2019s revenues, and a strong probability it\u2019s already booking losses.\n\nThe Journal, however, adds an important proviso. The piece notes that the $90 billion figure for China \u201c[excludes] trades made by a subset of very large traders.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take a stab at estimating how much crypto those whales are buying and selling on Binance. So the all-in China number is bigger than $90 billion. We just don\u2019t know by how much.\n\nCCData provides contrasting numbers to Fortune\n\nThis writer asked CCData, a leading global digital currency data provider that tracks trading volumes for a number of exchanges, to provide a detailed breakdown for Binance from 2021 through the close of July. As a CCData analyst told Fortune, \u201cWe\u2019re plugged into the exchange. We get the data directly from Binance, trade by trade.\u201d\n\nCCData shows volumes much higher than the annualized $5 trillion\u2013plus hinted at in the Journal piece, though the absence of \u201cthose very large traders\u201d makes data from the two sources difficult to compare. Still, the CCData numbers trace a downward spiral in Binance\u2019s business, caused by a combination of an overall fall in crypto trading since the summit in 2021, and in recent months, a decline in Binance\u2019s part of that shrinking market.\n\nIn 2021, digital currency transactions boomed, reaching $74 trillion for the year, according to CCData numbers. Binance captured an incredible $31.7 trillion, or 43% of those trades. The frenzy cooled considerably last year. Volumes fell by over one-third to $48.7 trillion. Though Binance slightly grew its share, the overall retreat lowered its take by 26% to $23.3 trillion.\n\nIn 2023, the scale of all global transactions kept falling. But Binance got a big boost via the collapse of its premier global competitor, FTX. From January through March, Binance\u2019s trading defied the downturn by running at the same yearly dollar rate as in 2022. The turning point came in March, when Binance ended a promotion, started in July of last year, allowing spot customers to buy and sell Bitcoin, using the most prominent coins, at a zero fee.\n\nFrom the start of April through the end of July, Binance suffered a dramatic downshift in horsepower. Its annualized volumes slowed to $16.8 billion a year, down around 28% from both the first three months of this year, and measured against 2022. After hitting 55% in spot and 65% for futures in February, its shares dropped respectively to 40% and 56% in July. Keep in mind that Binance is now capturing a smaller piece of a pie that\u2019s much reduced from either 2022 or even the first quarter of this year.\n\nWhat Binance\u2019s falling volumes could mean for revenues\u2014and BNB\n\nIn May, CCData posits that Binance did $1.3 trillion in trades, three times the number derived from the Journal\u2019s reporting that China accounted for 20% of Binance\u2019s volume that month. This doesn\u2019t mean the Journal\u2019s numbers are incorrect. We simply don\u2019t know how much including the business from its largest customers would have increased the implied total.\n\nLet\u2019s see what the current annual run rate of $16.8 billion, as shown in the CCData figures, might mean for Binance\u2019s revenues. Binance earns a maximum 10 basis points, or one-tenth of 1% on spot trades, and between 2 and 4 bps on futures. But it offers huge discounts for major customers under its \u201cVIP\u201d program. For example, a fund or market maker that pays with its native BNB coin gets 25% off on spot transactions, and a 10% reduction on futures. Holding BNB in your account, and doing lots of trading, garners further reductions that can take fees down far more than 50% off the top posted rates.\n\nOver the past four months, Binance has done an annualized $2.8 trillion in spot transactions, and $14 trillion in futures. By Fortune\u2019s estimate, the fees it actually collects, after those steep discounts, might be 7 bps for spot and 2 bps for futures. If so, the revenues from the former are running at $2 billion, and from the latter at $2.8 billion. That\u2019s a total of under $5 billion. Using the same analysis, the number in the peak year of 2021 would have been closer to $10 billion.\n\nThis writer, however, finds reason to believe that Binance\u2019s revenues are actually well below $5 billion. The reason: It\u2019s offering a big promotion for its VIP customers likely to take my estimated, post-discount 7 bps take on spot trading\u2014its most lucrative category\u2014a lot lower. Big traders now pay zero commissions on all purchases and sales pairing Bitcoin and the prominent TUSD token running on Ethereum, and for transactions linking Binance\u2019s stablecoin BUSD and all other cryptos except Bitcoin, BNB, and Ether.\n\nFortune provided Binance a summary of the assumptions that went into these estimates and the view that its revenues have most likely fallen below $5 billion a year. By email, Binance furnished the following response: \u201cAs a private company, we don\u2019t share financial information publicly, but your estimates are not correct.\u201d\n\nThe impact of falling revenues on BNB\n\nCZ has acknowledged that Binance holds large amounts of BNB on its balance sheet. Crypto data analysts have put this number at 60 million to 70 million coins. Binance did not object when I submitted that range for a previous story. Taking the midpoint of 65 million, that\u2019s around 45% of the roughly 150 million BNB extant. At BNB\u2019s current price of $243, its all-in market cap is $36.5 billion, and Binance harbors about $16 billion worth in its treasury.\n\nThe rub: BNB\u2019s fundamental value is closely tied to Binance\u2019s revenues. The \u201chighest and best use\u201d that establishes the bedrock value for all of BNB is the dollars of potential discounts it commands on trades. The less money Binance gets from matching buyers and sellers, the less BNB is worth, at least in principal. Here\u2019s the math. At Binance\u2019s spot annual run rate of $2 billion, BNB\u2019s 25%-off saves customers $500 million a year. The 10% break for the $2.8 billion in futures equals $280 million. In other words, BNB\u2019s good for a maximum of $780 million per year in discounts.\n\nWe can apply a multiple to see the market cap that $780 million in commissions savings should command. Successful private companies can sell at a P/E of six. But that\u2019s too high for BNB, because its sponsor, Binance, is a declining, high-risk enterprise. So let\u2019s apply a multiple of four. Doing so puts BNB\u2019s fundamental value at $3.1 billion.\n\nBut it\u2019s selling at almost $37 billion, over 10 times that number! That\u2019s a valuation higher than for all but 225 U.S. publicly traded enterprises, and equals the individual caps of Biogen, Dell, and Ross Stores. BNB\u2019s price is protected because the Binance team and the company itself hold the vast majority of coins, and customers get additional discounts for locking it in their brokerage accounts. Those conditions keep daily transactions extremely low, and the price high.\n\nThe danger comes if Binance\u2019s revenues drop so low that it\u2019s forced to start liquidating its BNB stash to pay operating expenses. Forced sales of this heretofore extremely risky, illiquid coin could prompt the non-team, non-company holders to dump their BNB as well, causing a rush toward fundamental value, thus erasing tens of billions in crypto market cap. For Binance, the fall would eliminate what now appears a substantial, over $16 billion cushion against hard times. But hard times for Binance threaten ruin for BNB. And the crunch has already commenced."

Big traders now pay zero commissions on all purchases and sales pairing Bitcoin and the prominent TUSD token running on Ethereum, and for transactions linking Binance\u2019s stablecoin BUSD and all other cryptos except Bitcoin, BNB, and Ether.\n\nFortune provided Binance a summary of the assumptions that went into these estimates and the view that its revenues have most likely fallen below $5 billion a year. By email, Binance furnished the following response: \u201cAs a private company, we don\u2019t share financial information publicly, but your estimates are not correct.\u201d\n\nThe impact of falling revenues on BNB\n\nCZ has acknowledged that Binance holds large amounts of BNB on its balance sheet. Crypto data analysts have put this number at 60 million to 70 million coins. Binance did not object when I submitted that range for a previous story. Taking the midpoint of 65 million, that\u2019s around 45% of the roughly 150 million BNB extant. At BNB\u2019s current price of $243, its all-in market cap is $36.5 billion, and Binance harbors about $16 billion worth in its treasury.\n\nThe rub: BNB\u2019s fundamental value is closely tied to Binance\u2019s revenues. The \u201chighest and best use\u201d that establishes the bedrock value for all of BNB is the dollars of potential discounts it commands on trades. The less money Binance gets from matching buyers and sellers, the less BNB is worth, at least in principal. Here\u2019s the math. At Binance\u2019s spot annual run rate of $2 billion, BNB\u2019s 25%-off saves customers $500 million a year. The 10% break for the $2.8 billion in futures equals $280 million. In other words, BNB\u2019s good for a maximum of $780 million per year in discounts.\n\nWe can apply a multiple to see the market cap that $780 million in commissions savings should command. Successful private companies can sell at a P/E of six. But that\u2019s too high for BNB, because its sponsor, Binance, is a declining, high-risk enterprise. So let\u2019s apply a multiple of four. Doing so puts BNB\u2019s fundamental value at $3.1 billion.\n\nBut it\u2019s selling at almost $37 billion, over 10 times that number! That\u2019s a valuation higher than for all but 225 U.S. publicly traded enterprises, and equals the individual caps of Biogen, Dell, and Ross Stores. BNB\u2019s price is protected because the Binance team and the company itself hold the vast majority of coins, and customers get additional discounts for locking it in their brokerage accounts. Those conditions keep daily transactions extremely low, and the price high.\n\nThe danger comes if Binance\u2019s revenues drop so low that it\u2019s forced to start liquidating its BNB stash to pay operating expenses. Forced sales of this heretofore extremely risky, illiquid coin could prompt the non-team, non-company holders to dump their BNB as well, causing a rush toward fundamental value, thus erasing tens of billions in crypto market cap. For Binance, the fall would eliminate what now appears a substantial, over $16 billion cushion against hard times. But hard times for Binance threaten ruin for BNB. And the crunch has already commenced."
