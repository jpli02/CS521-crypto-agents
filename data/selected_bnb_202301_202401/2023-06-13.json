        "content": "The Binance cryptocurrency exchange has announced that Maverick Protocol (MAV) will be the next project featured on its Launchpool platform. This means that eligible users (KYC is required) will be able to earn MAV tokens by staking BNB and/or TUSD tokens.\n\nThe MAV farming period will begin on June 14, 2023 at 00:00 UTC and will last for a period of 25 days. The farming period will end on July 8 at 23:59 UTC.\n\nFarm MAV tokens on Binance\n\nBinance plans to distribute 30 million MAV tokens through the Launchpool program. This allocation corresponds to 1.5% of the token supply (2 billion tokens).\n\n24 million MAV tokens will be distributed to BNB stakers, while the remaining 6 million MAV will go to TUSD stakers. The amount of MAV each user will receive will depend on two factors: the size of their stake in proportion to the size of the respective staking pool, as well as the staking duration.\n\nIn addition, Binance also says it will be listing MAV for trading in pairs against BTC, USDT and TUSD. The MAV / TUSD will be especially interesting, as it will launch with no maker fees. However, the date of the listing has not been announced yet \u2014 the exchange says MAV will be listed when it meets the exchange\u2019s liquidity requirements.\n\nBinance Launchpool is a great way to farm new tokens while taking on minimal risk. This is because users can choose to unstake their tokens at any time. Unstaked tokens become available for use immediately.\n\nWhat is Maverick Protocol (MAV)?\n\nMaverick Protocol is a project that\u2019s creating an advanced AMM (automated market maker), which is a popular type of decentralized exchange. The protocol aims to deliver increased efficiency to LPs (liquidity providers) by providing different modes that LPs can utilize depending on market conditions.\n\nThe platform features four different liquidity modes, which are fine-tuned to perform in specific market conditions. For example, Mode Right is optimized for bullish markets, Mode Left is optimized for bearish markets, and Mode Both is optimized for sideways markets.\n\nMaverick protocol implements MAV as its utility token. Users who stake MAV receive veMAV, which is used to vote on governance proposals.\n\nCurrently, Maverick Protocol is available on the Ethereum mainnet, where it can be used through the app.mav.xyz interface.\n\nHow to farm MAV tokens on Binance?\n\nIf you want to farm MAV tokens, the first thing you\u2019ll need is a Binance account.\n\nCreate Binance Account\n\nPlease keep in mind that only users who complete an identity verification process with Binance are eligible to participate in MAV token farming on Binance Launchpool.\n\nOnce you account is ready, you\u2019ll need some BNB or TUSD tokens to stake. If you already own these tokens, you can deposit some to your Binance account. Otherwise, Binance offers plenty of ways of buying these tokens with either crypto or fiat.\n\nAfter your account is verified and loaded up with some BNB, TUSD, or both, head over to the menu in the top side of the Binance interface and select \"Earn\". Then, go to \"Launchpad\".\n\nThen, scroll down to the \"Launchpool\" section and you\u2019ll be able to find the available MAV farming pools. Depending on which tokens you want to stake, select the TUSD Pool or the BNB Pool. Then, follow the instructions provided by the exchange."

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nTwo days ago, on June 12th, BTC price started a slow but steady recovery from the June 10th drop that took it from $26,450 to $25,500.\n\nThe recovery progressed smoothly for nearly 24 hours, allowing Bitcoin\u2019s price to reach $26,291 before it suddenly crashed again.\n\nThis time, the drop took the coin\u2019s value to $25,762 at its lowest point in the last 24 hours. Since then, BTC has started recovering once again, reaching the $26k level. However, since the price dropped below it, this level turned into a strong resistance that rejected the price back to $25,883.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price is recovering again, taking another attempt to breach the $26k resistance, currently sitting at $25,969.\n\nAccording to analysts, the correction was not too damaging to the coin\u2019s price, and Bitcoin can still grow back up. Some of the more optimistic predictions expect it to go up to $41k. However, analysts also warn that a further correction to $21.5k is still a possibility.\n\nThey recommend that users focus on sales transactions for the time being. However, the bad news is that even if BTC reaches the ceiling of $41k, that would mean the completion of the ABC pattern. As a result, the coin could see a massive bearish wave that would put the bottom at $9k.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s drop caused by new Binance rumors\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent price drop may have been caused by a new rumor surrounding Binance. The exchange has been making headlines for days now after the US SEC filed a complaint against it and Coinbase.\n\nNow, rumors emerged that the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange has been selling large quantities of Bitcoin to keep the price of BNB coins from dropping below certain levels.\n\nBinance\u2019s CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) immediately addressed the rumors, denying them. He said that \u201cBinance have not sold BTC or BNB. We even still have a bag of FTT. It is amazing they can know exactly who sold based on just a price chat involving millions of traders. FUD.\u201d\n\n4. Binance have not sold BTC or BNB. We even still have a bag of FTT. It is amazing they can know exactly who sold based on just a price chart involving millions of traders.

The company claims that the tipping feature violates its policy, requiring all tips to come via in-app purchases.\n\nOn the positive side \u2014 at least for Bitcoin, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor said that the crypto industry is forced to be Bitcoin-focused due to the regulators in the US.\n\nEnforcement actions on crypto firms, primarily by the SEC, could lead to the Bitcoin-focused US.\n\nRegulatory clarity is going to drive #Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion & anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors.

Their search led them to a new hit on the meme coin market \u2014 Wall Street Memes (WSM).\n\nThe new meme token is in the middle of its presale and has already raised $6.88 million at the time of writing. Each token is being sold at a price of $0.0286 million, which will be the case for another day. After that, the price will grow to $0.0289 per WSM.\n\nThe asset was inspired by WallStreetBets, an investment-oriented subreddit that challenged institutional investors in early 2021 when they attempted to short the stocks of several firms, including GameStop.\n\nAmateur investors decided to help the companies by engaging in massive stock purchases, causing institutions to lose money as a consequence of their greed.\n\nRelated\n\nPlayDoge (PLAY) - Newest ICO On BNB Chain Rating 2D Virtual Doge Pet\n\nPlay To Earn Meme Coin Fusion\n\nStaking & In-Game Token Rewards\n\nSolidProof Audited - playdoge.io Join Presale"

        "title": "As regulators circle, Binance's foundation\u2014its BNB coin\u2014is already crumbling - Fortune",
        "content": "So far, the main impact of the SEC lawsuit against Binance appears to be the crippling of its U.S. arm. The agency\u2019s broadside, launched on June 5, prompted banks serving Binance.US to cease allowing its customers to use dollars for purchasing the tokens they trade on the platform, a hit that if not reversed, will chase traders away in droves. And if granted by the courts, the SEC\u2019s proposed asset freeze would deliver a death blow. Though the American affiliate is now imperiled, it represents a tiny part of the Binance empire that as recently as December, controlled two-thirds of all the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies. What\u2019s been mostly overlooked is the extreme vulnerability of Binance.com, the giant global exchange, to a loss of confidence and steep fall in price in its native self-created coin, BNB. (You can read my earlier feature for Fortune about how Binance makes its money here.) Put simply, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao built his entire empire on the faulty foundation of BNB. And now, as demonstrated by its recent sharp decline, the inevitable cracks are showing, and the fissures threaten to bring down the entire edifice.\n\nIt\u2019s even possible that the SEC action mainly targeting the U.S. operation could also inflict big damages on Binance.com. In the complaint, the regulator names the parent of the global exchange, Binance Holdings Ltd., as a defendant. The complaint, for the first time, establishes the SEC\u2019s position that BNB is a \u201csecurity,\u201d which to be lawfully sold and traded to U.S. customers must be registered with the agency. Of course, neither Binance nor any other coin issuer has sought approval from the SEC. Hence, the suit asserts that Binance.com unlawfully sold BNB in the U.S. as part of its 2017 initial coin offering (ICO), stating that \u201cBinance\u2019s ICO was marketed and sold to investors globally and Binance imposed no restrictions on U.S. investments in BNB.\u201d The action further charges that Binance.US violated securities laws by selling BNB to more than 40,000 U.S. investors. \u201cIt\u2019s highly possible that the SEC could seek large penalties not just from Binance.US, but from the big exchange because of the allegedly illegal sales cited in the complaint,\u201d says Alex More, an attorney at Carrington Coleman in Dallas who represents a number of cryptocurrency clients.\n\nHow BNB forms the backbone of the Binance system\n\nBinance\u2019s financial strategy centers on boosting the value of BNB. In an August 2019 podcast, CZ declared, \u201cEquity is a virtual concept inside somebody\u2019s head. Tokenomics, the new way of having a token, is much better.\u201d The rub: Binance has succeeded in inflating the token\u2019s price so outrageously beyond its inherent value that BNB is overdue for a steep fall\u2014and its descent now appears to be underway. CZ has skillfully worked the levers on both sides of the price dynamic. Binance lifts demand by granting customers that use it for trades a 25% discount on commissions on spot transactions, and 10% off for futures. It also keeps the amounts in circulation extremely low by giving further breaks to clients who park lots of BNB in their accounts: Hold over $100,000 in BNB, and you qualify for an 80%-plus markdown on commissions.\n\nAt the same time, Binance systematically shrinks the supply by \u201cburning\u201d coins in each quarter, meaning that it permanently removes the BNB from circulation. Binance doesn\u2019t purchase those tokens on the open market. Rather, it scuttles coins either held on its balance sheet or owned by its founding team. Since its launch in 2017, Binance has eliminated 45 million, or almost a quarter, of the original 200 million BNB.\n\nThe squeeze caused by enticing customers to pay in BNB, and also passively hold the coins, and by ratcheting down the amount in circulation, ignited a price explosion virtually unrivaled in the history of capital markets. In the 2017 ICO, Binance sold the coins for 15 cents each. When both crypto prices and Binance\u2019s trading volumes soared at the start of 2021, BNB scored a moonshot. In November of that year, it reached $623, notching a market cap of over $100 billion. Its 4,000-fold jump over four years dwarfed the 20 times gain in Bitcoin during the same period.\n\nBut following the CFTC suit that preceded the SEC onslaught, BNB hit the skids. From $348 on April 16, it fell as low as $227 on June 12, before rebounding to $237 the next day in the euphoria over the surprise consumer price index report. Despite that overall 31% drop in just two months, BNB still sports a gigantic valuation of $37 billion. To put that number in context, it\u2019s 71% the value of General Motors.\n\nWhat\u2019s BNB really worth?\n\nAlong with its obvious appeal for speculation, BNB does command fundamental value. Its \u201chighest and best use\u201d comes as a kind of \u201cfrequent flier\u201d mile used to secure discounts on trades. As a result, its basic worth aligns closely with Binance\u2019s revenues. The more money the exchange collects from trading, the greater the dollar value of the markdowns secured via using BNB. Binance\u2019s trading volumes peaked in 2021 at around $2 trillion a month, or $24 trillion for the year, according to figures from CryptoCompare. Even at those frenzied, summit numbers, BNB was grossly overvalued.\n\nBut since late March, owing in part to the back-to-back blows from the CFTC and SEC, Binance\u2019s turnover has dropped around 35% from 2021 levels to an annualized rate of $15.5 trillion. Binance charges maximum fees of 10 basis points (one-tenth of 1%) for spot trades and three basis points (bps) for futures, the latter accounting for over three-quarters of all transactions. But it heavily discounts both categories not just for paying in BNB, but to reward high dollar volumes of trades, and big amounts of BNB and BUSD, its stablecoin, in customer accounts. By Fortune\u2019s estimates, Binance is netting less than 5 bps on the average trade. Hence, its total revenues are running at a yearly rate of roughly $7 billion to $8 billion. So we\u2019ll take a midpoint estimate of $7.5 billion. And that\u2019s a highly optimistic estimate.\n\nOf that number, approximately $2 billion are spot trades. On those, the 25% discounts from paying in BNB are potentially worth $500 million a year in savings to customers. On the $5.5 billion in futures business, the discount is much lower at 10%\u2014meaning BNB could reduce client fees by $550 million. Add it all up and BNB is good for reductions of just over $1 billion a year. To get a \u201cpresent value\u201d for BNB, we need to assign a multiple, the equivalent of a P/E for stocks, to that roughly $1 billion. Since Binance is shrinking, not growing as in the past, the multiple must be extremely low. Matt Sekerke, a fellow at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, deems a factor of five is appropriate. \u201cAnd even that\u2019s a best case, generous number,\u201d he told Fortune. That math puts BNB\u2019s current value at around $5 billion. That\u2019s one-seventh of its current market cap.\n\nThe existential danger posed by a further fall in BNB\n\nIn a past investigative story on Binance, this writer reckoned that the exchange now holds between 60 billion and 70 billion BNB on its balance sheet. It apparently amassed that total from collecting loads of the coins from clients who used BNB in order to secure deep fee reductions. Also, CZ has stated repeatedly that the company never sells any of the BNB it collects, although it does pay some salaries and bonuses in the coins. I ran the 60 billion to 70 billion figure past a spokesperson for Binance, who did not object to the estimate.\n\nAt current prices, Binance holds a BNB hoard \u201cworth\u201d $15 billion. That sounds like a safe cushion. But it\u2019s not. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if Binance is like a typical company getting sales in a foreign currency and hedging in case that currency declines in value against the dollar, for example,\u201d says Sekerke. BNB is a coin Binance invented, and whose price it largely controls. As long as Binance achieved gigantic margins, it could afford to bank all the BNB flowing in, and send almost none of it out for operating expenses.\n\nBut now, Binance\u2019s falling revenues could force it to use a large portion of the arriving BNB to pay salaries, rent, and mounting legal expenses. Keep in mind it\u2019s mainly obligated to cover those costs in hard currencies, in dollars and euros, not in BNB. A switch to dumping BNB instead of hoarding it would have the opposite effect of the strategy that created the bubble: It could trigger a race to the bottom. A falling BNB price would undermine traders\u2019 willingness to hold it as a ticket to discounts. They\u2019d start selling their coins, and sans the markdowns that BNB provides, reduce their trading on Binance.com, lowering its revenues.\n\nThe reversal in the BNB flywheel would severely hammer Binance\u2019s balance sheet and endanger its ability to cover operating costs denominated in fiat currencies. CZ\u2019s dream of touting \u201ctokenization\u201d as the new capitalism is a fantasy that may soon cost him his company."
