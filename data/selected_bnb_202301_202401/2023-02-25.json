        "content": "1INCH was the second most traded DeFi projects on the BNB chain in the last 24 hours.\n\nMarket indicators and on-chain metrics were bearish and initiated the price decline.\n\n1inch Network [1INCH] announced an update for its RabbitHole on 23 February. For the uninitiated, RabbitHole is a custom RPC feature that protects Metamask users from front-running, directly within the 1inch user interface. Now, with this new update, user protection will now include Uniswap liquidity providers in addition to 1INCH swaps.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 1INCHs worth today?\n\nThis update helped 1INCH maintain its popularity. According to CoinGecko\u2019s data, 1INCH was only second to FLOKI on the list of the most traded DeFi projects on the BNB chain in the last 24 hours. Interestingly, DappRadar revealed that 1INCH ranked third in terms of top DeFi dApps by volume, which was commendable.\n\nHowever, none of these updates reflected on 1INCH\u2019s daily chart, which was painted red. As per CoinMarketCap, 1INCH\u2019s price declined by 2% in the last 24 hours, and at the time of writing, it was trading at $0.6175 with a market capitalization of over $489 million. Not only the price but 1INCH\u2019s volume also registered a decline of nearly 40% during the last day.\n\nConcerns remain for 1INCH\n\nCryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that 1INCH\u2019s exchange reserve was increasing, which indicated high selling pressure. The number of active addresses on 1INCH has also decreased, indicating fewer network users. The development activity of 1INCH has decreased over the last seven days, which is also a negative signal for a blockchain because it represented less effort by developers to improve the network.\n\nHowever, accumulation seemed to have increased as 1INCH\u2019s total supply held by top addresses went up slightly. In addition to that, despite the price plummet, its demand in the derivatives market increased as its DyDx funding rate registered an uptick in the last few days.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s 1INCH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThe bears are here to stop the uptrend\n\nA look at 1INCH\u2019s daily chart suggested that the bears have entered the market and might restrict 1INCH\u2019s price from moving up in the coming days. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a downtick and was headed towards the neutral mark.\n\n1INCH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar pattern as it went down slightly. Nonetheless, the Money Flow Index (MFI) was bullish as it was headed further up from the neutral mark of 50."

        "title": "IceCreamSwap Unveils Liquid Staking on CORE - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "CORE\n\nUsers can now wrap CORE tokens to StakedCore (SCORE) tokens which continuously earn auto-compounding staking rewards and are directly tradable and usable in DeFi protocols.\n\nUse SCORE for Liquid Staking and DeFi\n\nMulti-chain Decentralized Exchange (DEX) platform, IceCreamSwap, has unveiled its innovative StakedCore (SCORE) token for Core DAO enthusiasts.\n\nThe token, generated from staking Core DAO\u2019s native $CORE currency, was launched by the platform to supercharge CORE staking. When users wrap CORE to SCORE, it is deposited into the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) part of the Satoshi Plus Consensus mechanism. After staking, rewards are automatically compounded and increase the price of the SCORE token.\n\nThis innovation implies that the SCORE token strongly correlates with CORE\u2019s price but reliably outperforms it due to the earned staking rewards. Therefore, SCORE increases as CORE price increases and vice versa. Most importantly, the token can be utilized like other ERC20 tokens, unlike regular staked tokens that are untouchable. IceCreamSwap disclosed to BSCNews that users could either hold or utilize the token with Decentralized Applications (dApps).\n\n\u201cThe SCORE is compounding automatically, and users can use it to either hold the token, which is like staking with auto compounding, or use it in DeFi applications, like providing liquidity for a swap to earn additional rewards on top of the staking rewards.\u201d IceCreamSwap wrote.\n\nUsually, when users stake their CORE holdings, it becomes untouchable. But with SCORE, users can use their staked tokens while the rewards are compounded automatically and even earn additional rewards on top of the staking rewards. IceCreamSwap announced the new feature on February 25 via Twitter.\n\nThe deposit and withdrawal are handled on the SCORE smart contract created by the DEX, allowing users to deposit CORE into SCORE and withdraw SCORE into CORE. IceCreamSwap will also create a big CORE/SCORE liquidity pool for users to trade without complexities.\n\nIceCreamSwap is revolutionizing the blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space with many innovations. The protocol aims to offer users ease through SCORE while enjoying the benefits of tokenized and auto-compounding CORE staking.\n\nEarn additional rewards by providing SCORE liquidity\n\nIn addition to the staking rewards, users can provide CORE/SCORE liquidity on IceCreamSwap to earn trading fees and ICE rewards.\n\n\u200d\n\nGet SCORE tokens\n\nThere are two simple ways to get SCORE tokens, either buy them on IceCreamSwap DEX just like any other token\n\nOr wrap CORE to SCORE by sending native CORE to the SCORE token contract address 0xA20b3B97df3a02f9185175760300a06B4e0A2C05\n\nAdd SCORE token to a wallet\n\nThe address of the SCORE token is 0xA20b3B97df3a02f9185175760300a06B4e0A2C05, which can be used to import the SCORE token to a wallet. IceCreamSwap also can add the token to connected wallets by simply pressing the MetaMask symbol after selecting the SCORE token\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat is IceCreamSwap:\n\nIceCreamSwap is a multi-chain DEX comprising numerous features such as Swap, Bridge, Staking, Farm, and Launchpad. The protocol allows users to trade tokens with its friendly UI across numerous chains, including Core, XDC, Bitgert, and BNB Chain.\n\nWhere to find IceCreamSwap:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat is Core DAO:\n\nCore DAO is the official decentralized organization developing the Satoshi Plus ecosystem. It represents an opportunity for miners to access new revenue streams by contributing hash power to the chain. Inspired by the principles of both blockchains, Core displays a deep appreciation for the crypto ecosystem's history and an even greater excitement for Core\u2019s role in its future.\n\nWhere to find Core DAO:\n\nWebsite | Docs | Twitter | Discord\n\n\u200d"

        "title": "TruthGPT: the truth token born from an Elon Musk tweet, everything there is to know - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "TruthGPT ($TRUTH) is a community-driven token built on the Binance Smart Chain. The token was born almost as a joke, from a tweet by Elon Musk, until it became a full-fledged reality.\n\nSpecifically, the goal of the TruthGPT founding community is to get the attention of Tesla genius Elon Musk and get him to tweet about TruthGPT. So as to become the best AI Chabot with one main goal: to reveal $TRUTH.\n\nHow TruthGPT came about: all the details\n\nFollowing the joking tweet by CEO of Twitter Elon Musk that \u201cwhat we need is TruthGPT,\u201d as a jab at the text-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT, which allegedly refuses to answer some controversial questions, a project of the same name leveraging the technology appeared in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nIndeed, Musk took to Twitter to voice his criticism that ChatGPT apparently censors specific topics it deems controversial, suggesting that it plays into some propaganda and apparently suggesting the need for an alternative AI that would not be censored in this way, according to his social media posts since 17 February.\n\nThus, a Twitter page for \u201cTruthGPT\u201d was launched the same day, and its first tweet quoted the relevant statement from Tesla\u2019s CEO, along with his contract address and links leading to its Telegram channel and TruthGPT (TRUTH) list of tokens on the cryptocurrency trading platform DEXtools.\n\nMeanwhile, the team explained on its Telegram channel that its mission was \u201cbuild the vision that Elon Musk has; an AI Chat Bot programmed to spread the honest truth about whatever may be asked.\u201d\n\nDevelopment has already begun and soon TRUTH will not only be a powerful meme currency, but a beacon of honesty and truth that the world can access. In several subsequent tweets, the platform also urged Musk to assist with the mass adoption of TruthGPT.\n\nSpecifically, promoting its role in free speech and artificial intelligence as \u201ctruth on steroids,\u201d which would analyze cryptocurrency market sentiment through social media posts and news articles, as well as use AI algorithms to prevent fraud in cryptocurrency trading.\n\nWhy is TruthGPT opposed to ChatGPT?\n\nAs anticipated, the TruthGPT team went on to explain that its platform is not subject to censorship, manipulation, or any form of bias, citing its bot that answered a question about ChatGPT critically:\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that ChatGPT and OpenAI are politically biased and heavily policed. Don\u2019t be fooled: TruthGPT is the only true alternative AI that offers unbiased and unvetted data.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cTruth Bot\u201d itself was successfully launched on Telegram on 19 February, and according to data retrieved from the block explorer and analytics platform Etherscan, there are already 682 TRUTH token holders on the Ethereum blockchain (ETH), and the total supply is 5 trillion TRUTH.\n\nMusk criticizes ChatGPT: here\u2019s why\n\nElon Musk, who is actually a co-founder of OpenAI, the company at the helm of ChatGPT, revealed the doubts, misgivings and benefits of the chatbot to everyone during the World Government Summit in Dubai:\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest risks to the future of civilization is artificial intelligence. It\u2019s both positive and negative, and it has big, big promise, big capabilities.\u201d\n\nThis is part of what Musk said, emphasizing that with that comes a great danger.\n\nIn a nutshell, ChatGPT is an advanced form of artificial intelligence powered by a large language model called GPT-3. This chatbot is programmed to understand human language and generate responses based on huge amounts of data.\n\nThe danger lies mainly with the rise of ChatGPT and artificial intelligence, which Musk says threatens to disrupt the job market.\n\nOpenAI, a US startup that developed ChatGPT, has been one of the central topics of public debate for several weeks now, precisely because of its incredible advanced artificial intelligence features.\n\nTo date, Elon Musk no longer owns any shares in the company, having left the company\u2019s board of directors in 2018. One of the main reasons Musk founded OpenAI was Google\u2019s lack of focus on AI security.\n\nHowever, today Musk states:\n\n\u201cIt was initially created as an open source non-profit organization. It is now closed-source and for profit. I do not have an open stake in OpenAI, nor am I on the board of directors, nor do I control it in any way.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a few days ago, the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, responded to OpenAI by creating his own version of ChatGPT, called Bard, saying that artificial intelligence is the deepest technology we are working on today.\n\nMusk finally commented on the matter:\n\n\u201cI think we need to regulate AI safety, frankly. I think it\u2019s actually a bigger risk to society than cars or planes or medicines. Regulation might slow down AI developments a bit, but I think that could also be a good thing.\u201d\n\nTruthGPT: how to buy the token and price trends\n\nTo purchase the TruthGPT token, it is first necessary to install MetaMask or Trust Wallet and follow the instructions. Then, it will be necessary to add $BNB to one\u2019s wallet by transferring it from an exchange, like Coinbase for example.\n\nAlternatively, it can be purchased directly. Next, it is necessary to link one\u2019s Metamask wallet and exchange $BNB for $TRUTH on PancakeSwap. Then, hold until Truth is reached.\n\nIn addition, the first edition of TruthGPT is available for free and public use on Telegram. As mentioned above, TruthGPT focuses on providing unbiased truth, rather than being programmed to follow political agendas like ChatGPT.\n\nIn terms of pricing, within days of launch, we see that the token after only 48 hours of launch had already reached a market capitalization of $5,000,000 and over 2,000 holders. Moreover, in the same time frame, TruthGPT AI v1 was launched.\n\nIt did not end there, because after not even 72 hours the market capitalization was $10,000,000 for TRUTH. Hence, at the moment, everything seems to be proceeding for the best for the Truth token; all that remains is to observe what will happen."
