        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSan Francisco-based blockchain firm Ripple has struck a deal with African payments fintech Onafriq to open new remittance corridors between Africa and the Gulf Cooperation Council, the U.K., and Australia.\n\nRipple, Onafriq Forge New Payment Corridors\n\nRipple will power new remittance corridors between 27 African countries and Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) under a partnership with Onafriq.\n\nThe alliance leverages Ripple\u2019s Payments\u2019 blockchain technology to tackle persistent issues in cross-border remittances like transfer delays and exorbitant costs, which could likely enhance the money transfer process in Africa.\n\nThree new blockchain-based payments corridors will launch between Onafriq customers in Africa and users of PayAngel in the U.K., Pyypl in GCC member states Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, and Zazi Transfer in Australia, as per an official announcement Nov. 8 at Ripple\u2019s annual Swell conference in Dubai.\n\n\u201cConnecting our partners PayAngel, Pyppl and Zazi Transfer with Onafriq over Ripple Payments will bring the benefits of faster and more cost-effective cross-border payments to individuals seeking to send money into Africa from around the globe,\u201d Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of global customer success Aaron Sears posited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnafriq, previously known as MFS Africa, intends to utilize Ripple\u2019s cutting-edge tech to connect its extensive mobile money network, which comprises more than 500 million mobile wallets across Africa.\n\nRipple Adoption Gets Major Boost\n\nOnafriq\u2019s collaboration with Ripple aligns with its vision to make borders matter less when it comes to cross-border payments between Africa and other markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Ripple president Monica Long believes the move contributes to the company\u2019s payments \u201cbeing able to cover 90% of FX markets.\u201d\n\nDuring the Swell event, Ripple also emphasized its commitment to adjusting and responding to the payment requirements of new clients and enterprises across different regions. Ripple has strikingly received the requisite regulatory approvals, including money transmitter licenses in the U.S. and an institutional payments license in Singapore.\n\nThat being said, Ripple has been in the spotlight lately after several bullish developments. The National Bank of Georgia (NBG), for instance, selected Ripple as its official technology partner for the pilot of its Digital Lari CBDC, raising hopes of more imminent adoption among XRP devotees."

Nevertheless, its recent performances have not failed to impress observers. Should we expect an XRP bull run like other major cryptocurrencies? Time will tell. Let\u2019s delve into the details!\n\nXRP Shatters Records Again\n\nOur analysis on November 1 highlighted a 13% surge in XRP\u2019s price in just three days. This isn\u2019t surprising given that Ripple\u2019s cryptocurrency has been on an upward trajectory since January 2023.\n\nThis surge has enabled Arthur Britto, co-founder of the blockchain payments company, to project an All-Time High (ATH) of $10,000 for this digital asset, attracting interest from the BRICS.\n\n$XRP flipped $BNB to become the fourth-largest token by market cap, days after Ripple said it would work with authorities in Georgia and Dubai for CBDC and XRP-related services. By @shauryamalwa.https://t.co/qQrWshqOMq \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) November 6, 2023 XRP Climbs the Ranks Step by Step\n\nAccording to CoinDesk, XRP surged by 10% in the last 24 hours, but that\u2019s not all! This crypto coin has also excelled in terms of trading volumes, reaching $2 billion in transactions. Evidently, the $1 billion recorded last Sunday doubled in just one day.\n\nWith such statistics, XRP has taken BNB\u2019s place as the 4th most significant cryptocurrency in terms of market cap.\n\nHowever, a quick check on CoinGecko revealed that things seem to have returned to normal. Although XRP continues to trade at $0.69, Binance\u2019s native crypto has reclaimed its former position. It\u2019s worth noting that XRP is far from the 50% surge displayed by Solana\u2019s SOL. But with gains of +26.3% in 14 days and 32% in a month, Ripple\u2019s token asserts itself as a significantly important asset.\n\nBNB, Still in a Bind?\n\nLike most cryptocurrencies, Binance Coin also experienced glory in 2021. Twice, BNB surpassed the $630 mark in a single year. However, volatility took its toll on this crypto.\n\nIts current price is well below half of these records: $250 per coin.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s an issue between BinanceUS and the SEC, resulting in legal actions in June and a downfall for BNB. Indeed, since June, Binance\u2019s native crypto hasn\u2019t revisited the $300 mark.\n\nEven a month after the American regulator\u2019s attack, BNB modestly showed a valuation of $240.309. Last September, nothing changed: Binance\u2019s crypto decided to stabilize in a range between $212 and $207, signifying a move towards high liquidity.\n\nXRP\u2019s victory might have been brief in these 24 hours. However, with widespread institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency, BNB could permanently lose its ranking.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!
