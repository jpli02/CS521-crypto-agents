        "content": "Yesterday\u2019s announcement that the SEC has sued Binance turned the whole market red, and BNB was quick to crash.\n\nKey Support levels: $265\n\nKey Resistance levels: $291\n\nVolatility spiked as soon as the news that the SEC has filed a lawsuit against Binance broke out. The price of BNB fell by 10% within two hours. The rest of the market also followed suit, and most charts turned bearish.\n\nThe current support for BNB is found at $265 and is likely to be tested if sentiment remains bearish. The resistance is at $291.\n\nTrading Volume: The volume spiked as sellers rushed to the exit. In the process, BNB fell under $300.\n\nRSI: The daily RSI reached the oversold area at under 30 points. This shows an extreme level of fear in the market.\n\nMACD: The daily MACD turned bearish as soon as the news broke out. At this time, bears have full control of the price action.\n\nBias\n\nThe bias for BNB is bearish.\n\nShort-Term Prediction for BNB Price\n\nThe market is still digesting the news, and more volatility can be expected. For this reason, a test of the key support at $265 appears likely before buyers return. Binance has promised to fight the SEC, so this story is likely to continue developing for some time."

        "content": "Crypto exchange Binance has refuted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) assertion that its BNB token is a security, according to a statement shared with CryptoSlate.\n\nOn June 5, the SEC labeled the BNB token, alongside digital assets like BUSD, ADA, ALGO, FIL, and others, as securities in its lawsuit against Binance.\n\nBinance refutes SEC\u2019s claims.\n\nIn an e-mailed response to CryptoSlate, a Binance spokesperson said BNB is a native token designed to create an internal economy, adding that its value derives from its participants.\n\nBinance said:\n\n\u201cBNB allows users who want to engage with projects (such as gaming, social, financial, or other utilities) built on those chains to transact with BNB, creating user demand for BNB as a reflection of community-built projects. The coins do not represent an investment contract of any sort and as such are not securities.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the crypto exchange faulted the Commission\u2019s classification of BUSD as security. According to the firm, BUSD is a fiat-backed stablecoin that another independent financial agency in the U.S., the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has described as \u201ca non-security commodity\u201d through court action.\n\nMeanwhile, this is not the first time the SEC would describe a crypto project as a security. In April, the Algorand Foundation refuted the Commission\u2019s classification of its ALGO token as a security.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler has maintained that all digital assets except Bitcoin (BTC) are securities and highlighted the noncompliance of crypto firms.\n\nSEC action wiped over $4B from BNB market cap\n\nNews of the SEC\u2019s lawsuit and its security classification of BNB wiped more than $4 billion from the asset market cap during the last 24 hours, according to CryptoSlate data. BNB\u2019s market cap dropped to as low as $42.54 billion from a peak of $46.93 billion.\n\nIt has since retraced to $43.35 billion as of press time.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange\u2019s native token declined more than 10% to a low of $272.89\u2014its lowest value since March 12, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data. The token was trading for $278.14 at the time of writing.\n\nBNB\u2019s crash reflects the performance of the broader crypto market during the last 24 hours. CryptoSlate reported that the SEC action wiped off $53 billion from the total crypto market cap.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Here\u2019s Why Binance Coin ($BNB) Stays Bullish in the Long Term; Buy the Current Dip? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The recent lawsuit filed against Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, and CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao caused a significant downtick in the majority of major cryptocurrencies. On June 5th, the BNB coin registered an intraday loss of 9% which plunged to the current price of the $277.7 mark. However, it seems the current correction is part of a bigger chart pattern that prevents this altcoin from a major downtrend. Here\u2019s how interested traders can look for long opportunities despite the considerable sell-off.\n\nAlso Read: Smart Money Buying Crypto Amid US SEC Binance Crackdown\n\nadvertisement\n\nBinance Coin Daily Chart\n\nA steeper trendline governs the ongoing correction phase in BNB\n\nThe $250 support aligned with the lower trendline of the triangle pattern creates a strong accumulation zone.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in the BNB coin is $389.5 Million, indicating an 11.2% loss\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nIn the weekly time frame chart, the BNB price shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern. For over a year, the price has rebounded thrice from the resistance trendline and twice from the lower trendline indicating that traders respect this pattern and would likely follow its potential target too.\n\nBy the press time, the Binance coin price trades at $278, with an intraday gain of 0.5%, however, if the supply momentum persists, the sellers may pull the coin 8% down to retest the lower trendline at $260.\n\nPreviously, when altcoin plunged to the support trendline, the prices witnessed a massive growth in June 2022, and January 2023. Therefore, until this pattern is intact, the BNB holders can maintain a bullish outlook.\n\nWill Binance Coin Reclaim $350 Mark?\n\nThe triangle pattern is currently carrying a sideways trend in BNB price. Under the influence of this pattern, the coin price could witness a prolonged consolidation phase for the coming month or two until either of its trendlines is breached. Therefore, interested traders are looking for a long opportunity for a breakout above the pattern\u2019s resistance trendline. This potential breakout could push the prices to the first target of $350.\n\nBollinger Band: The coin price hitting the 3rd deviation band of the BB indicator , suggests the price has witnessed an aggressive fall in a relatively short period and therefore, a minor pullback move or sideways action is plausible.\n\nAverage Directional Index: An uptick in the daily ADX slope accentuates the sellers\u2019 strength and a higher possibility to reach $250."

        "title": "Opinion: It's painfully obvious that BNB is an unregistered security - Protos",
        "content": "The year is 2017. Bitfinex is trying to recover almost 120,000 bitcoin stolen in a hack and giving customers a 33% haircut; BitMEX is pushing 100X leverage on all its customers. Through the fog, a glimmering beacon of hope appears for shitcoin retail traders: Binance.\n\nThe freshly minted exchange soon became the go-to bazaar for new traders and veterans alike. Volume ballooned and fortunes were made within the casino that claimed to have no headquarters.\n\nIn September, Binance created and issued its own token, BNB, on the Ethereum blockchain. The token promised discounts on trading fees, a specific burn rate, and \u2014 without using so many words \u2014 a return on investment.\n\nBinance thrived. Meanwhile, other hacks occurred, other exchanges found themselves in the crosshairs of regulators, and influencers got sued for undisclosed promotions. But BNB shot up in value, from $1 to over $600 in 2021.\n\nBefore the SEC, BNB was suspected to be a security\n\nLong before BNB peaked repeatedly in 2021 (and certainly before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Binance with securities violations on Monday) many were questioning whether the token was an unregistered security.\n\nIn 2018, Laura Shin interviewed the chief exec of Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). It was an historic moment for me \u2014 the first time I saw BNB clearly for what it was. I urge everyone to listen to the entire discussion, but this is a transcript of the moment it hit me:\n\nLaura Shin: Well that\u2019s kind of interesting to me what you said about how you want to have BNB to be used to pay for other things because typically, at least so far in the crypto space, the tokens that have been used for money are decentralized \u2014 like Bitcoin, Ether, Zcash, Monero \u2014 and here you\u2019re creating this sort of company coin that you want other vendors to use and for people, in general, to use as money. Is that the vision there?\n\nCZ: No, essentially not a company coin. So, the Binance coin itself lives on the blockchain \u2014 right now it lives on the Ethereum blockchain. Very soon we will have our own blockchain which is also a decentralized platform \u2014 so in that regard we\u2019re the same as all the coins you just mentioned. And it\u2019s not a coin by the company, it\u2019s still a community.\n\nWe are the issuers. We have issued it. And people have bought it and it\u2019s been spread out. And we do hold quite a large number of it, but we\u2019re not going to be able to issue anymore, so we no longer have a lot of control on the coin. What we could control is, basically, as we are still the very large shareholders of the coin we\u2019re financially incentivized to make the coin worth more. And we\u2019re incentivized to work really hard to add more utility, to add more use cases. The more use cases the coin has, the more utility value it will have, and then hence the price. So we\u2019re very encouraged to do that.\n\nLaura Shin: See, it\u2019s statements like that that make me think, \u201cOh, that sounds like a security to me. It\u2019s like XRP.\u201d\n\nBNB satisfies the Howey Test\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Howey Test, it\u2019s used in the US to determine if a transaction is an investment contract, and therefore subject to securities laws. Let\u2019s run through the criteria for a security and see if CZ\u2019s interview with Shin checked any of the boxes.\n\nInvestment of money: CZ specifically states that \u201cpeople have bought [BNB] and it\u2019s been spread out,\u201d meaning that many people have bought the coin issued by Binance. Common enterprise: CZ directly established a connection with the token\u2019s use cases and utility, adding value to the coin for investors. Reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others: CZ quite literally discusses the Binance team being incentivized to drive the value of the coin up.\n\nA single interview with the CEO of Binance in 2018 dismantled any real argument anyone could level against the simple suggestion that BNB is an unregistered security.\n\nCould the SEC have acted sooner?\n\nOn Twitter, the SEC brilliantly chose to meme one of the most potent pieces of evidence provided in its lawsuit against Binance: a quote from its chief compliance officer, \u201cWe are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.\u201d\n\nToday we charged Binance Holdings Ltd. (Binance); U.S.-based affiliate, BAM Trading Services Inc., which, together with Binance, operates https://t.co/swcxioZKVP; and their founder, Changpeng Zhao, with a variety of securities law violations.https://t.co/H1wgGgR5ir pic.twitter.com/IWTb7Et86H \u2014 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) June 5, 2023\n\nRead more: Binance market share dropped by a quarter since February\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the quote is from 2018, raising the question: how long has the SEC been investigating Binance and could they have acted sooner?\n\nUltimately, court documents and time will provide an answer (if a settlement isn\u2019t reached), but in the meantime there are dozens of cryptocurrency exchange tokens with almost identical parameters to BNB that are now squarely in the crosshairs of the SEC.\n\nSo, when the SEC files a complaint against the next major exchange, let\u2019s not pretend it\u2019s an inter-governmental conspiracy to choke the cryptocurrency industry. Let\u2019s have the decency to admit people were clumsy and reckless while breaking the law \u2014 and got caught.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

        "title": "How Has BNB Fared as Markets Have Had Time to Digest Binance vs. SEC? - Securities.io",
        "content": "The crypto market took a tumble on Monday, which is continuing today after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the world's largest crypto exchange Binance for allegedly running an illegal operation in the US.\n\nAs the price of Bitcoin dropped under $25,500 and Ether below $1,800, BNB lost more than 11% of its value as it fell to about $272. It marked BNB's biggest one-day drop so far this year. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap has recorded a drop of 3.8% to now stand at $1.135 trillion.\n\nBNB is the 4th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $43.7 billion and has been managing over $1.5 billion in 24-hour trading volume.\n\nNot just tokens but shares of crypto-related stocks also got hammered in tandem with the broad market losses.\n\nThe shares of the largest crypto trading platform in the US, Coinbase (COIN), dropped more than 10%. The publicly traded company itself received a warning from the SEC earlier this year in March that it may also receive enforcement action related to the listing of potential unregistered securities.\n\nSince then, Coinbase has been expanding its presence in other countries, such as Canada. CEO Brian Armstrong has also been meeting with the Abu Dhabi and Dubai regulators. According to Armstrong, these places have clearer rules for crypto firms than the US, making it easier to operate there.\n\nCoinbase then argued back in April that the SEC's move undermined its own role as the monitor of companies registering to sell shares to the public. The trading platform has also requested a court to compel the agency to respond publicly to their petition from July 2022 asking for clearer crypto regulation guidelines.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, tweeted that he will be testifying before the House Committee on Agriculture on Tuesday regarding the need for clear crypto rules as well as the Digital Asset Market Structure discussion draft released Friday.\n\n\u201cThe US is falling behind,\u201d tweeted Grewal. \u201cWe cannot afford to ignore crypto while other markets take advantage of our absence, developing rules and regulations that enable the industry to thrive and risk sending jobs, investment, and technological leadership overseas.\u201d\n\nBesides Coinbase, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet, fell almost 9%. Additionally, several bitcoin mining stocks took a hit, too, with Bitfarms (BITF) dropping by more than 6%. Meanwhile, both Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) recorded a decline of over 9%.\n\nBNB: The Native Token of the Binance Ecosystem\n\nAs of writing, BNB is trading at almost $277, down 14.5% in the past two weeks. Still, the coin is up 23.23% year-to-date (YTD), although it has fallen 59.5% from its all-time high (ATH) of $686 that it hit in May 2021.\n\nBNB is up a whopping 697,400% since hitting an all-time low of $0.0398 over five years ago in Oct. 2017.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is the exchange token of the centralized crypto trading platform Binance and holders get to access discounted fees on the exchange. According to Binance, \u201cBNB coin is not a security\u201d but rather a \u201cnative token designed to create an internal economy\u201d where its \u201cvalue derives from its participants.\u201d\n\nOriginally launched on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB was later migrated to Binance's own layer 1 network called Binance Smart Chain, now called BNB Chain, on which applications can be built. This makes it a competitor to the Ethereum network, with faster and cheaper transactions but more centralized.\n\nBNB Chain's DeFi ecosystem is currently the third-largest, after Ethereum ($26.36 bln) and Tron ($5.52 bln), with $41.12 billion of total assets locked (TVL), as per DeFi Llama. Decentralized exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap accounts for 42.10% of this TVL.\n\nCAKE, the native token of DEX PancakeSwap, also plummeted by 11% and is currently trading at $1.58. The $320 million market cap token recorded $61 million in 24-hour trading volume.\n\nBesides having a centralized exchange, Binance also has its own DEX on the BNB Chain.\n\nBinance created BNB tokens to raise funding through ICO in July 2017 at a price of 2,700 BNB per ETH. One hundred million BNB tokens were kept by the founding team and angel investors.\n\nIn its original whitepaper, Binance also proposed spending 20% of its profits every quarter to buy back and remove tokens from circulation until only 100 million are left. As of writing, BNB has a total supply of 200 million BNB tokens, and about 157.88 million are circulating in the market, according to CoinGecko.\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nSEC Files Charges Against Binance and CZ\n\nBinance was founded by CEO Changpeng Zhao, known by his initials CZ, in 2017. The cryptocurrency exchange has been facing regulatory scrutiny for a long time now, and with the US regulators cracking down on the crypto industry, things are getting harder for Binance.\n\nThis week, the second civil complaint targeted the trading platform in recent months after an earlier lawsuit from the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nIn March, the CFTC filed a complaint in federal court in Chicago alleging Binance and CZ offered crypto futures and other derivatives to US residents without registering them with the CFTC. Binance's former chief compliance officer Samuel Lim aided and abetted the platform in violations of US law, alleged the CFTC lawsuit.\n\nBefore that, in Feb., New York regulators shut down the issuance of BUSD, which accounted for roughly 40% of the company's monthly trading volume. This isn't all. Between Aug. and Dec. 2022, Binance also faced scrutiny for backroom asset shuffling. Reportedly, about $1.8 billion were moved to hedge funds without informing the customers, who were told the assets were 100% backed.\n\nIn the latest situation, the SEC sued Binance and CZ on charges of securities violations. In total, 13 charges were filed against the platform, alleging the exchange made unregistered and unlawful offers and sales of its exchange token BNB and stablecoin BUSD as well as certain crypto-lending products and a staking-as-a-service program.\n\nThe SEC also alleged that Binance.com wasn't registered as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency.\n\nAccording to the SEC suit, many crypto assets, including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Axie Infinity (AXS), and Coiti (COTI) that traded on Binance are securities and require registration and regulation. Resultantly, some of these tokens, especially the metaverse ones, are down the most in the past 24 hours.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler took to Twitter on Monday to comment on the situation, stating that Binance entities and CEO CZ engaged in \u201can extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure and calculated evasion of the law.\u201d\n\nThe regular further alleges that the platform misrepresented trading controls and oversight on Binance.US.\n\nAccording to the SEC's lawsuit, while the exchange claimed US customers were restricted from transacting on Binance.com, in reality, it was secretly allowing high-value US customers to continue trading on the platform.\n\nAdditionally, it is claimed that Binance and CZ \u201csecretly controlled the Binance.US platform's operations behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nThe agency then goes on to allege that both Binance and CZ controlled customers' assets and commingled with them as they pleased. As per the SEC, the funds were diverted to a CZ-owned and controlled entity called Sigma Chain, which engaged in manipulative trading that artificially inflated the platform's trading volume.\n\nSEC further alleged that Binance concealed the fact that it was \u201ccommingling billions of dollars of investor assets\u201d and sending them to another Zhao-owned entity Merit Peak Limited.\n\nBinance to Defend \u201cVigorously\u201d\n\nIn response to the SEC lawsuit, Binance released a statement on Tuesday in which it said in clear terms that it will defend against any allegations and its platform \u201cvigorously.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SEC's refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission's misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry,\u201d said Binance.\n\nAccording to the exchange, the agency's actions only undermine America's role as a global hub for financial innovation and leadership.\n\n\u201cDigital asset laws remain largely undeveloped in much of the world, and regulation by enforcement is not the best path forward. An effective regulatory framework demands collaborative, transparent, and thoughtful policy engagement \u2013 a path the SEC has abandoned,\u201d it added.\n\nMeanwhile, the lawsuit has users withdrawing from Binance, which is recording outflows of $719 million over a 24-hour period, as per data from Nansen. Its stablecoin balance, however, remains healthy at just over $8 billion, with a seven-day outflow of $519 million.\n\n\u201cOur team is all standing by, ensuring systems are stable, including withdrawals and deposits,\u201d tweeted CZ on Monday.\n\nThe exchange actually lost 14.5% of its market share in the past three months, according to research provider CCData. At its peak, Binance had captured 57.5% of the average monthly volume in February, which has now dropped to 43%.\n\nRecently, the exchange also announced its plans to cut jobs, which it said wasn't a case of sizing but rather a re-evaluation of whether the company has the right talent. Patrick Hillmann, chief strategy officer of Binance, described the downsizing as a \u201chistoric operational challenge.\u201d\n\nOver the last five years, Binance has seen \u201cexponential growth\u201d as its team expanded from a mere 30 to more than 8,000 employees.\n\nAmidst all that is going on, it is speculated that CZ will step down from his role as CEO. CZ was already looking to reduce his ownership of Binance.US in an attempt to appease US regulators.\n\nRichard Teng, a one-time Abu Dhabi regulator who oversees Binance's regional markets outside the US, is seen as the most likely successor to CZ. Prior to heading up the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), Teng was a chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and spent more than a decade with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)."
