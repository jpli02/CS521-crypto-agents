        "content": "A leading analyst is warning that crypto assets may face more downside during the current market correction.\n\nPseudonymous analyst and trader Bluntz tells his 222,800 Twitter followers that altcoins are trending downwards on the large time frames and could fall far more than what is currently being anticipated.\n\nCiting the example of Polygon (MATIC), Bluntz says that the Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling solution has just slipped below an ascending channel and is heading lower.\n\n\u201cSo many altcoins losing really high time frame structure now. MATIC, for instance, is breaking down from a 12-month bear flag and just had a solid close below a year long channel.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m starting to think things are going quite a bit lower than many are anticipating.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst and trader, MATIC could plummet by up to 54% from current levels.\n\n\u201c[A drop to] $0.40 \u2013 $0.50 more reasonable I think.\u201d\n\nPolygon is trading at $0.869 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Ethereum, Bluntz says that the second-largest crypto asset will plunge soon after closing below a weeks-long ascending channel.\n\nFrom his chart, it appears Bluntz is targeting Ethereum to fall to below $1,700. ETH is trading at $1,842 at time of writing.\n\n\u201cUnderside bear flag retest of ETH looks done, I\u2019m thinking the bottom falls out of this quite soon.\u201d\n\nNext up is Binance Coin (BNB), the utility token of the Binance Smart Chain. Bluntz says that BNB has come under severe pressure when paired against Bitcoin, falling by over 35% since late last year.\n\n\u201cOf all the majors BNB has got to have one of the most savage downtrends on its BTC pair, literally down only, not even remotely sideways like ETH/BTC has been.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "An Angus farmer hopes his latest diversification will really \u2018take off\u2019 after landing a private jet as a holiday hideaway.\n\nIain Gall bagged the Hawker 700 when he chanced upon it on Ebay.\n\nIt\u2019s now been installed on the family\u2019s Glenskinno Farm, overlooking Montrose, as a quirky addition to a thriving holiday accommodation business.\n\nAnd Iain hopes that by late summer the first arrivals will be welcomed on board for an Angus getaway.\n\nPlane was a TV star\n\nIn its heyday, the twin-engined British Aerospace aircraft was a \u00a310million Russian oligarch\u2019s toy.\n\nAnd its high-flying history after being saved from the scrapyard sparked Iain\u2019s interest in the plane.\n\nIn 2020, the Hawker featured on George Clarke\u2019s Amazing Spaces when an English aviation enthusiast spent \u00a320,000 converting it into a luxury crash pad.\n\nIain, 35, said: \u201cI\u2019d been looking for a railway carriage to covert and put on a site here at the farm.\n\n\u201cLast October I was sitting out on the farm waiting for a lorry which had been delayed.\n\n\u201cI went looking on Ebay on my phone under glamping, came upon the jet and thought that looks really familiar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d previously seen the George Clark programme, googled it and it was the same plane.\n\n\u201cSo the next day we set off for Selby in Yorkshire and a deal was done with the owner.\u201d\n\nGlamping in style\n\nThe 6.7 tonne fuselage has long since lost its wings so it was a road trip on a low loader back to Angus.\n\nIain, who is also a Scottish Conservative councillor for Montrose, has propelled himself into the project.\n\nIt\u2019s set to be one of Scotland\u2019s most unusual glamping pods for two people.\n\n\u201cThe interior is all original, with the captain\u2019s chairs, leather and mood lighting in the roof,\u201d said Iain.\n\n\u201cIt was all boxed up so it\u2019s still in amazing condition.\u201d\n\nThe previous owner converted the rear of the plane into a full-size shower room.\n\nAnd the cosy cockpit houses the plane\u2019s double bed.\n\nWindow seat views will be spectacular when the venture is cleared for take off.\n\nVisitors will enjoy southerly views of Montrose Basin and the town, and the Angus glens and Cairngorms to the north.\n\nJet set status will carry over into a hot tub beside the plane.\n\nIt also remains turbine powered since electricity is generated by the farm\u2019s own wind turbine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting project and I\u2019m looking forward to getting it up and running,\u201d said Iain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something a little bit unusual and we\u2019re hoping people will see it as ideal for a night or two away.\u201d"

        "title": "Crypto's Tale of Two Tokens: Bitcoin vs. Binance Coin and the Rise of PAT WARS - TechCabal",
        "content": "Crypto has tumbled through a bumpy ride in the past few months, and institutional investors are looking at it warily due to its volatile nature. However, Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s Elliot Han suggests that institutional investors\u2019 interest is still strong and is even maturing. In this article, we\u2019ll compare and analyze the similarities and differences between two major projects in the same industry, Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB), and discuss how they relate to investments, decentralized finance, governments, and digital assets. In addition, we will also be looking at PAT WARS (PAWS) , a new meme coin, and why it\u2019s attracting the attention of institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin and Binance: Decentralization, Market Cap, and Regulatory Landscape\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) are both digital assets that operate using blockchain technology. Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. The Binance Chain, started by Binance, has evolved into a decentralized blockchain ecosystem that is now community-led, open to all, and operates without requiring permission.\n\nOne of the main differences between Bitcoin and Binance is their market capitalization. As of May 2023, Bitcoin has a market cap of around $1.1 trillion, while BNB\u2019s market cap is over $48 billion.\n\nBTC and BNB are two of the major players in the crypto market, and as such, have had to face many challenges. Governments have had mixed reactions to the DeFi nature of these coins, with some viewing them as a potential threat to their centralized financial systems while others have embraced them as digital assets.\n\nBitcoin vs Binance: Two Titans of Crypto Investing for Seasoned Traders\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Binance are popular choices for seasoned investors looking to expand their portfolios. Institutional investors have been slow to embrace cryptocurrencies, but their interest in the space is growing. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are two large banks that began experimenting with blockchain technology a few years ago and are still interested in the market, according to Han. However, Han warns that there is still a high level of volatility, uncertainty, and regulatory action that needs to be taken into account before investing in certain coins.\n\nPAWSitive Investment: How PATWARS is Winning Institutional Interest in DeFi\n\nWith institutional investors\u2019 interest in Decentralized finance (DeFi) increasing, PAT WARS (PAWS) emerges as a promising new meme token in the DeFi space. PAWS\u2019s brand message resonates with decentralization, prioritizing user governance in addition to community-driven decision-making. Through PATWARS DAO, users can vote on initiatives which promote community engagement and ensure the token\u2019s long-term success and sustainability. The governance model\u2019s transparency and adherence to DeFi principles are crucial for PAT WARS\u2019s success.\n\nAs the crypto market matures, BTC and BNB remain two of the top players in the industry. While they have their differences, both offer unique opportunities for seasoned traders looking to invest in digital assets. As institutional investors show growing interest in the space, new tokens like PAT WARS are emerging in the DeFi sector, offering new and promising investment opportunities!\n\nClick the Links Below for More Information on PATWARS!\n\nWebsite: https://www.patwars.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PATWARSOfficial\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/PATWARSOfficial\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "Binance has long been among the most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges on the market. Moreover, the largest exchange by trading volume has continued growing its DeFi offerings. Specifically, through the BNB Smart Chain, but what is it?\n\nThe name Binance has continued to be as important as ever in the industry. Now, what was previously the Binance Smart Chain has become another facet of the growing ecosystem within the digital asset industry.\n\nIn 2019, Binance Chain was officially launched as a platform developed to expand the ecosystem and embrace decentralization. Moreover, it supports a native token, the Binance Coin (BNB), which was converted from Ethereum.\n\nIn order to understand what the BNB Chain is, it helps to understand how it started. Additionally, understanding its place in the vast Binance ecosystem can give a good look into its vast functionalities.\n\nWhat is BNB Smart Chain?\n\nThe BNB Smart Chain first arrived in 2020 as a brand-new blockchain service. Specifically, the offering allowed developers to build their own decentralized applications, or dApps, using smart contracts. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao first announced BNB as an abbreviation for \u201cBuild N\u2019 Build,\u201d referring to his desire for the community.\n\nConversely, the original Binance Chain differed in its functional offerings, while being upgraded by the newly developed BNB Chain. Moreover, the current iteration notes fast transaction speeds with an increase in available features.\n\nAdditionally, the BNB Chain has compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). That is the Ethereum computation engine that ensures smart contract functionality. Subsequently, the offering maintains the capability to run dApps that are ported over from Ethereum.\n\nInterestingly, the BNB Chain is not really qualified to stand as a redesign of the Binance Chain. However, it also isn\u2019t a layer 2 protocol to expand on the Binance Chain. Conversely, the BNB chain is separate and can continue in the event the Binance chain falters. However, the two are designed to work together with builders.\n\nAlternatively, it is important to mention that Binance does not own or control the BNB chain. Specifically, the exchange stated that \u201cBNB Chain was originally initiated by Binance but has since grown to become a community-driven, permissionless, and decentralized blockchain ecosystem.\u201d\n\nHow the BNB Chain Works\n\nSource: The Japan Times\n\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed what it is, let\u2019s delve into some facets of how the BNB chain actually works. Firstly, starting with the consensus mechanism used, a proof-of-staked authority algorithm (PoSA). This is different from the widely publicized proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) system.\n\nThe PoSA model is a combination of two different ones. Specifically, the PoS model and the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) model used by platforms like VeChain. Moreover, this model has validators on the network that have staked BNB. Subsequently, they received transaction fees after validating approved blocks that were on the network.\n\nBinance Chain and BNB were developed to work together, which is aided by Binance\u2019s cross-chain compatibility functions. Moreover, assets are able to transfer across the blockchains. Meaning users can utilize the fast trading capabilities of the Binance Chain, with the smart contract function of the BNB Chain.\n\nAdditionally, its EVM-compatible capabilities ensure that users can port dApps across the blockchain easily. This development could interest developers due to the growing relevance of Ethereum in the industry. Specifically, as scaling concerns continue to be addressed, they continue to grow in prominence. Allowing the BNB chain to grow alongside it.\n\nWhat Makes BNB Chain Unique\n\nSource: PYMNTS.com\n\nAlongside its capabilities, there are also qualities that make the BNB chain a unique asset. Specifically, the Biniace and BNB Chain connections present a different tool for developers. There is the potential for them to utilize the strengths of both blockchains while maximizing the output of their specific applications. Ultimately, increasing the quality of the projects.\n\nAlongside that cross-compatible quality is compatibility with EVM. This is an incredibly positive feature as it allows projects to be transferred from Ethereum, and elaborated on with the BNB Smart Chain.\n\nThe popularity of Ethereum is undeniable, and it will only continue to grow. Since the merger that culminated in the Shanghai upgrade, the network has only grown in relevance and prevalence. Additionally, the Ethereum network is constantly growing, which is both good and bad for the BNB chain.\n\nVarious blockchains are coming through the Ethereum network, but BNB has the Binance name behind it. Subsequently, the funding and recognition of the Binance brand, and the largest exchange by transaction volume, will only help to grow the BNB Chain alongside other Ethereum network programs. Conversely, liquidity and funding are benefits to anything in the exchange\u2019s vast ecosystem.\n\nWho Is It For?\n\nSource: The Economic Times\n\nUltimately, the BNB Chain was created as a tool for developers. Moreover, it was invented to aid in the creation and expansion of decentralized applications that will only increase the growing industry. Additionally, it is all about the creation of new projects, or the development of existing ones.\n\nBinance founder, Changpeng Zhao discussed the project with Decrypt in 2020. There, he discussed the company\u2019s perception of the BNB Chain, and how they hope it will continue to develop. Specifically, Zhao notes that the blockchain is meant to act as a bridge between the decentralized finance world and the centralized one.\n\nSource: Celebrity Net Worth\n\nAdditionally, it was reported that Binance established a $100 million fund to support its growing decentralized finance world. Importantly, that begins with their work on the BNB chain.\n\nIt has only been two years since the arrival of the BNB Chain, and things already look optimistic. Subsequently, Binance\u2019s continued investment in the platform and projects like it could benefit both the blockchain and the Binance ecosystem.\n\nAlthough Binance has long been the face of centralized exchanges, it has undoubtedly sought to attract DeFi developers under the Binance umbrella. Interestingly, the development of DeFi platforms is intended to do away with centralized finance.\n\nThis creates a rather interesting dichotomy in the core Binacen business model. Yet, it appears as though Binance has seen the necessity of continuing to water this ever-growing sector.\n\nThe BNB Token\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nAdditionally, it is necessary to discuss the native token of the BNB Smart Chain, the BNB Token. Ultimately, the cryptocurrency is what files the blockchain, and is native to both the BNB Chain and the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe blockchain governance token, BNB, fuels transactions that take place on the BNB chain, similar to gas used on the Ethereum network. Subsequently, you\u2019re required to own BNB in order to utilize the chain due to the decentralized nature of the platform.\n\nSource: Liputan6\n\nBNB functions like any other cryptocurrency, allowing trading and different utilizations. Not only can you use BNB on the Binance exchange, but you can pay for certain goods and services with your Binance card, or through Binance Pay. Additionally, you can donate to charity, take part in BInance Launchpad\u2019s token sales, or provide liquidity to Binaice Liquid Swap.\n\nUltimately, the widespread use cases of BNB are available due to the massive ecosystem that Binance provides. Yet another reason why the BNB Chain is so unique among DeFi blockchains."
