        "content": "Even though Miles Bridges didn't agree to a long-term contract extension this offseason, he will still be playing for the Charlotte Hornets in the 2023-24 season. As part of his agreement, Bridges now has the power to veto any trades involving him for the upcoming season. However, once the 2024 offseason arrives, he will become an unrestricted free agent. Charlotte will retain Bridges' Bird Rights next off-season which allows them to go over the cap to re-sign him, but Bridges has the complete freedom to sign elsewhere.\n\nBridges seems to be content rejoining his teammates after being away from the NBA for a year because of a domestic violence charge, to which he pleaded no contest. People will closely scrutinize the relationship between Bridges, the front office, and his agency Klutch over the next twelve months. Did the negotiations this offseason cause too much damage and tension between the two parties? Or was there mutual understanding and respect that this was the best way forward, leaving the possibility of a long-term agreement open in the future?\n\nFacebook - All Hornets\n\nTwitter - @All_Hornets and James Plowright"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nJack Dorsey, the founder and former CEO of Twitter, has urged the current leadership to integrate censorship-resistant protocols to help alleviate the burden of restrictions. This comes just months after billionaire Elon Musk acquired the social media giant and embarked on a journey to transform the platform.\n\nDorsey tweeted early Sunday, acknowledging the challenges of running Twitter and expressing hope for the platform\u2019s success. He further emphasized the importance of building on open protocols like Bitcoin and NOSTR to preserve the open internet.\n\nNOSTR is a protocol designed to create a censorship-resistant global social network using simple and flexible event objects and standard elliptic-curve cryptography for keys and signing.\n\nThe timing of Dorsey\u2019s tweet was notable, as it came just minutes before Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, announced temporary limits on account activities to address issues of data scraping and system manipulation.\n\nMusk\u2019s tweet sparked speculation about the platform\u2019s future direction under his leadership, with various users reporting temporary restrictions to views. In a later tweet, the Tesla boss stated that implementing the rate limit on Twitter was a last resort to prevent competitors from accessing Twitter\u2019s data. While acknowledging that it is a temporary measure, he assured users that normal Twitter functionality would be restored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter last year was met with anticipation and concern. The $44 billion deal marked a significant moment for the social media service but also raised questions about the platform\u2019s direction under Musk\u2019s ownership.\n\nMusk, known for his strong views on free speech, expressed his intention to create a more freewheeling platform, reverse the permanent ban on former President Donald J. Trump and integrate cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin for payments. Musk\u2019s ownership of Twitter also promised sweeping changes for the platform, including pledging new leadership, job cuts, and innovative strategies to monetize the service.\n\nCritics, however, have been voicing concerns about the potential for increased toxic content and misinformation on Twitter, with the public Square being sued for various alleged violations, including a $250 million copyright case last week by 17 music publishers.\n\nThat said, as Elon Musk addresses the challenges faced by Twitter, Dorsey\u2019s proposition on the integration of Bitcoin and NOSTR holds the potential to revolutionize the platform into a more decentralized and censorship-resistant space, according to some. At press time, however, Musk was yet to respond to the proposition."

The hackers appear to have made several transactions in huge assets on several chains.\n\nPolyNetwork assets have reportedly been hacked, and the perpetrators have added a huge number of assets to several chains.\n\nOn Heco, there is 999,8127T SHIB; Metis has received 99,99,184 BNB and 10 billion BUSD, while Polygon now has an additional 87,579,118 COW, and 999,999,434 OOE, 636,643,868 STACK, 88,640,563 GM and 2,175.0 53 03.

Hence, the funds on Metis Andromeda are secure because the huge amount of the assets will not get to cross-chain. The platform has also assured that they are in contact with PolyNetwork to lower the attack\u2019s impact and assess the situation more.\n\nWe are aware of Polybridge\u2019s ongoing situation, and are currently in contact with the PolyNetwork team to minimize the impact of the attack and further asses the situation.\n\n\n\nIn regards to the newly minted BNB and BUSD on Metis, there is no sell liquidity available.\n\n\n\nAll funds on\u2026 \u2014 Metis\ud83c\udf3f (@MetisL2) July 2, 2023\n\nYu Xian, the SlowMist founder, finds no need to worry since the $4.2 billion worth of assets the hackers have are mostly \u201cair\u201d and will not be tangible assets.\n\nBinance CEO Chanpeng Zhao took to Twitter to state that the attack does not affect Binance users since the exchange does not support deposits from PolyNetwork. He further said that the Binance security team is assisting with investigations.\n\nThis does not affect @Binance users. We do not support deposits from this network. Our security team is assisting them in its investigations though.

Earlier, in August 2021, PolyNetwork had a major hack where the platform lost more than $600 million. The hack was named the greatest DeFi hack of all time. According to reports, the hack resulted from mismanaged access rights between two major Poly smart contracts, the EthCrossChainManager and EthCrossChainData.\n\nSince the hacker returned almost all the $600 million apart from $33 million in Tether, the issuer froze these funds soon after the theft. In a message, the hacker had previously claimed that PolyNetwork offered them $500,000 to return the money, and they had turned it down despite being granted immunity.\n\nAccording to a recent report, the second quarter of 2023 had more than 208 million in DeFi stolen, with only $4.5 million recovered. The report noted that the DeFi hacks in Q2 increased seven times year-over-year. There have been 117 incidents reported in Q2 2023 compared to only 17 in the same period in 2022. The report noted the same high numbers in the first half of 2023, whereby about $665 million was lost to the hacks."

Makosov told FXStreet,\n\nThe exploit on the Poly Network further demonstrates the need to remain in a perpetual state of vigilance. Transfers of values between different blockchains use cross-chain transfer bridges managed by intermediary oracles. This usually provides an acceptable level of bridge security, but there is always a theoretical possibility that oracles can be hacked.\n\nMakosov explains that the security of oracle bridges helps support the DeFi project\u2019s security infrastructure, avoiding such exploits as seen in the Poly Network attack."
