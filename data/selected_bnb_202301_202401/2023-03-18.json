        "content": "At least four major crypto exchanges have now announced they plan to list Arbitrum\u2019s upcoming crypto asset, ARB.\n\nMEXC, Huobi and Bybit all say they will list ARB next Thursday, March 23rd, the date of the token\u2019s airdrop.\n\nBitrue also plans to list ARB, noting in a Twitter post that the opening time for deposits and trading will be updated.\n\nIn a blog post this week, Arbitrum developers announced the airdrop and outlined the protocol\u2019s upcoming plans to switch to being governed by a self-executing decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) scaling solution plans to airdrop 12.75% of the ecosystem\u2019s token supply to users next Thursday.\n\nThe developers say they created a special points system that takes into account a variety of metrics to determine which users will receive the crypto assets.\n\nArbitrum currently ranks fourth among all chains in terms of total value locked (TVL) with $1.77 billion, behind Ethereum, Tron (TRX) and BNB Smart Chain, according to the decentralized finance tracker DeFi Llama. Polygon (MATIC) is fifth, with $1.06 billion in TVL.\n\nThe TVL of a blockchain represents the total capital held within its smart contracts.\n\nTVL is calculated by multiplying the amount of collateral locked into the network by the current value of the assets.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
