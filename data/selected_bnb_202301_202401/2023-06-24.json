        "title": "Binance bids farewell to the Netherlands, Tradecurve will be available globally - Cyprus Mail",
        "content": "Amid multiple restrictions that Binance currently faces, the latest one comes from the Netherlands, forcing the exchange to cease its operations in the country. Meanwhile, investors turn to Tradecurve (TCRV), currently in Stage 4 of its public presale, which will deliver a borderless, permissionless platform and enable anyone worldwide to trade multiple asset classes from a single account.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBinance (BNB) Leaves the Netherlands\n\nEver since the announcement of the SEC lawsuit against Binance, the exchange giant seems like it cannot catch a break. Namely, after failing to obtain a license from the Dutch central bank, Binance is forced to shut down its operations in the country.\n\nMore specifically, Binance will not be accepting any new users in the Netherlands, effective immediately. Additionally, starting from the 17th of July, existing Binance users in the Netherlands can only withdraw funds from the platform, and trading and other Binance services will no longer be available.\n\nExperts say that the main reason behind Binance\u2019s inability to obtain a license to function as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) in the Netherlands is due to an administrative fine of over $3 million that the exchange received from the Dutch Central Bank in April 2022.\n\nHowever, this news did not significantly impact the Binance (BNB) price, as the token currently trades at $244.59, marking a 0.65% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) to provide a borderless, permissionless Hybrid trading platform\n\nOn the other hand, while Binance struggles with multiple restrictions, Tradecurve (TCRV) is here to fill the gap, offering users worldwide a permissionless, borderless hybrid trading platform that aims to remove all barriers to entry.\n\nNamely, Tradecurve will enable users worldwide to leverage their crypto balances to trade stocks, bonds, options, forex, commodities, ETFs, and crypto, all from a single account. Additionally, it is the first-ever decentralized solution that will provide all of these products, allowing users to trade financial derivates under total anonymity without fulfilling any KYC requirements.\n\nIn fact, all users need to do trade via Tradecurve is to create an account, connect their crypto wallets, deposit the crypto they want to use, and start trading on thousands of markets instantly.\n\nAdditionally, TCRV plans to introduce many exclusive features for its token holders, including discounts on trading fees, high leverage at 500:1, algorithmic AI trading, and copy-trading (where users can pay a subscription fee to traders with good success rates to copy their trades).\n\nAnd to top it all off, TCRV plans to launch a metaverse trading academy, where users can take courses and learn about trading strategies and techniques.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) is currently in Stage 4 of its public presale, where investors can purchase the TCRV token at $0.018. Additionally, due to its unparalleled utility and one-of-a-kind trading platform, experts believe TCRV will rise 50x before its presale ends, growing by an additional 100x once the token is launched.\n\nAnd, seeing as Binance itself started its BNB ICO at $0.11 and now trades at $244, the growth potential for TCRV is massive!\n\nFor more information about $TCRV presale tokens:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"
