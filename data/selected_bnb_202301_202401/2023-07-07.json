        "title": "XRP Is Not A Security? Pro-Crypto Lawyer Hints At Huge Unraveling In Ripple vs SEC Case - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nOutspoken pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton has expressed optimism regarding the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit, predicting that Judge Torres will thoroughly address the core question of whether XRP is a security in her upcoming summary judgment.\n\nIn a Twitter thread on Monday, Deaton firmly asserted that \u201cXRP IS NOT A SECURITY.\u201d He then established parallels between XRP and diverse assets like orange groves, whiskey, condos, and even Bitcoin (BTC). Deaton\u2019s argument centred on the notion that despite these assets being marketed and sold as investment contracts, their inherent characteristics remained unaltered.\n\n\u201cBTC was once sold as an investment contract (SEC v. Shavers), but that particular sale didn\u2019t transform BTC into anything other than what it is: a digital commodity,\u201d he stated.\n\nFurther, contrary to the belief of many experienced lawyers, Deaton asserted that Judge Torres would not shy away from addressing the issue of secondary sales concerning XRP.\n\n\u201cI believe Judge Torres has to address the underlying asset and secondary market sales. Could she avoid the issues and issue a ruling? Of course she could. But it would be a greater act of judicial activism to ignore the SEC\u2019s theory and NOT address these issues,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo support his argument, Deaton referred to a similar case handled by Judge Castel in 2020 involving the Telegram messaging app. This legal dispute began when the SEC intervened and halted Telegram\u2019s intended distribution of GRAM tokens. However, Judge Castel ruled in favour of the SEC, stating that Telegram had to repay investors $1.2 billion from their unsuccessful initial coin offering (ICO) for the Telegram Open Network.\n\nIt is important to remember that the theory posited by the SEC was that Ripple engaged in continuous activity resembling an ICO, considering each sale of XRP as part of a broader plan involving securities. However, Deaton clarified that the situation with XRP differed from the Telegram case because the latter involved an ICO with written contracts.\n\nDeaton further contended that XRP, powered by the XRP Ledger (XRPL) technology, had been operating effectively and openly traded for over seven years. Notably, even SEC staff members were permitted to own XRP until 2019, which was not the case with the Gram token.\n\nThe issue of secondary market transactions of XRP has been a crucial aspect in the SEC and Ripple legal battle. While the SEC accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security, it did not clearly distinguish between Ripple\u2019s direct sales and the subsequent trading on the secondary market, leading to confusion. Recently, Deaton opined that Judge Torres might address this issue based on a previous examination in the SEC vs LBRY lawsuit, as it sheds more light on the issue.\n\nThat said, while there\u2019s no guarantee, Judge Torres\u2019 summary judgment decision could shed light on XRP\u2019s security classification, potentially impacting the crypto industry significantly."
