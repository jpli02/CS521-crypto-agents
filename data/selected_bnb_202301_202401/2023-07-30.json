        "content": "The mystery of a man, who has been missing for 28 years, plagues one mother who is desperate to find her son. Marcus Rigby was last seen at a bed and breakfast on Portland in 1995. His mother Mary still honours his birthdays and is desperate to trace any information about him.\n\nMarcus was 27 years old when he went missing on April 17, 1995. He first left his home town of Grange-over-Sands near Cartmel in Cumbria, after telling his family that he was heading south to make a 'fresh start' and that he would be in touch in a week.\n\nSadly, the family never heard from him again. They later learnt that he had headed to his aunt's house for a couple of days and then went to Weymouth for work. There was a final sighting of Marcus, six months after his departure, and that was a bed and breakfast on Artists Row on Portland.\n\nRead more: Good Pub Guide: The 14 best pubs in Dorset you have to visit in 2022\n\nMarcus, an artist, left behind a son named Daniel who was 6 years old at the time of his disappearance, and his mother Mary has often spoken out about how all of the family yearn to see him.\n\nThe family are said to have received numerous reports of 'Marcus' being seen over the years around Dorset - however, these are unconfirmed. Marcus's disappearance has been featured on a variety of appeals, with some information citing that he may refer to himself as Marc Smith. Marc is described as being 5ft 11in, slim build and with brown hair.\n\nThe family continue to share updates and information on a dedicated Facebook page for Marcus here. If you have any information on missing Marcus, you can call Cumbria Police on 101. You can remain anonymous at Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or use their online reporting service.

        "content": "FDUSD started with a bang, recording 5 million in hourly trade volumes on the day of the listing.\n\nThe zero-fee trading program might have contributed to the soaring volume of the coin.\n\nStablecoin First Digital USD [FDUSD] made an impressive start after getting listed on the Binance exchange earlier this week.\n\nAccording to digital assets data provider Kaiko, FDUSD traded at a premium to world\u2019s largest stablecoin, Tether [USDT], briefly on 28 July, reflecting greater demand for the newly-listed asset.\n\nEffect of the zero-fee promotion?\n\nThe USD-backed stablecoin started with a bang, recording 5 million in hourly trade volumes on the day of the listing. However, as indicated above, volumes have considerably cooled off since then. Consequently, FDUSD\u2019s peg also stabilized at $1.00 at the time of writing, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFDUSD is a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin issued by Hong Kong-based First Digital Labs. The coin was listed as part of Binance\u2019s now popular zero fee trading program with all spot trading pairs, including FDUSD/USDT, becoming exempt from maker and taker fees.\n\nThe exchange fee waive-offs might have contributed to the soaring volume of the coin as highlighted earlier. It should be noted that Binance employed the same promotional strategy to promote another stablecoin, TrueUSD [TUSD].\n\nTUSD\u2019s market cap has more than tripled on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, as per Glassnode.\n\nBinance looks beyond BUSD\n\nBinance\u2019s aggressive backing of newer stablecoins should be seen in the light of the phasing-out stage of Binance USD [BUSD], which once vied for the stablecoin crown with Tether.\n\nIts downfall commenced after a New York-based regulator instructed the issuing company Paxos to halt the minting of new tokens. Since then, Binance has attempted to distance itself from BUSD and is looking to promote other stablecoins.\n\nWill the market achieve parity?\n\nThe success of TUSD and FDUSD was imperative to correct the imbalance in the current state of stablecoin market.\n\nAt the time of writing, USDT accounted for a massive 66% of the overall market share, having benefitted from the decline of USD Coin [USDC], DAI, and BUSD.\n\nUSDT\u2019s dominance could be ascertained by the fact that its market cap was twice as high as the combined market valuation of the next four stablecoins in the list.\n\nFDUSD\u2019s launch was mired in controversy briefly after a popular Twitter user alleged links between Tron [TRX] founder Justin Sun and the custodian First Digital. However, nothing in the public eye as yet to suggest anything of this sort."
