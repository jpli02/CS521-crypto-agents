        "content": "\u00d7 Expand Rendering by Tres31. This building design by Tres31 is the type of design that HBH Realty would like to use for a proposed four-story bed and breakfast in Hoover, Alabama.\n\nA Hoover Realtor is pursuing plans to build a four-story bed and breakfast facility near the Hoover Metropolitan Complex.\n\nJordan Masaeid-Hosey\u2019s company, HBH Realty, has purchased a 2.4-acre piece of property at the corner of Stadium Trace Parkway and Mineral Trace, across from Brock\u2019s Gap Brewing Co., and wants to build a bed and breakfast with 18 suites, each able to accommodate 6-10 people, she said.\n\nThe lodging facility also would have a spa and breakfast/brunch caf\u00e9 on the ground floor and rooftop bar and pool, Masaeid-Hosey said.\n\nBecause the Hoover City Council in February decided to mostly ban short-term rental properties in residential neighborhoods, Masaeid-Hosey is trying to provide an Airbnb-like experience in an area zoned for light industrial use near the Hoover Met.\n\nThere is a strong demand for short-term rental properties in Hoover, especially among people coming to take part in the many sports tournaments at the Hoover Met Complex, she said.\n\nMost of the people who come to those events don\u2019t come alone, Masaeid-Hosey said. They come in groups that like to stay together, she said.\n\nHotels work for some groups, but others like to have a lodging experience that allows them to stay and hang out together instead of being broken up into separate hotel rooms, Masaeid-Hosey said. Short-term rentals of single-family homes gave people that option, but now that is no longer available, she said.\n\nMasaeid-Hosey, who has a short-term rental business called GameOn BnB, was left scrambling to find short-term rental properties where people could stay outside of the city because it\u2019s no longer legal to do so in single-family neighborhoods in Hoover, unless for a special event and for less than seven days a year, she said.\n\nThat motivated her to move ahead with the bed and breakfast idea. She already was contemplating the idea near the Hoover Met but initially had put a lot of contingencies on her offer to buy the property, she said.\n\nAfter further evaluating the demand and possibilities for success, she later removed the contingencies and bought the property for $440,000, she said. \u201cI know the area is ready for it.\u201d\n\nSome residents in neighborhoods near the Hoover Met Complex in 2017 staunchly opposed commercial development near the Met, including the idea of a hotel. Opposition arose again in 2019 when the city hired a consultant to study the feasibility of a hotel on city property at the complex.\n\nMasaeid-Hosey said her proposal is much different than a hotel with 700 rooms. Her bed and breakfast would be much smaller and more quaint, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a hotel and Airbnb hybrid,\u201d she said.\n\nPlus, \u201cthis is not an entry-level property,\u201d Masaeid-Hosey said. \u201cThis is an extremely upscale, luxury, high-end-looking property. We plan on creating an experience like Hoover has never seen before that is going to be an asset to the community. It\u2019s very elegant. It\u2019s very sexy. It\u2019s very sleek.\u201d\n\nRental rates likely would start at $500 per night, she said.\n\nMasaeid-Hosey, who lives not far away in Blackridge, said she already has talked to some people in neighborhoods near the Met who are excited about what she wants to build and supportive of the idea. \u201cPeople are really looking forward to it,\u201d she said.\n\nShe immigrated to the United States from Jordan in 1999 as a child and graduated from Hoover High School. She\u2019s not some out-of-state real estate person who doesn\u2019t know anything about what the people of Hoover want, she said. \u201cI know what my community wants. I know what my neighbors want.\u201d\n\nThe four-story bed and breakfast likely will cost more than $10 million to build, Masaeid-Hosey said. She already has talked to several investors who are interested in fully funding it, but she would retain an ownership interest, she said.\n\nMasaeid-Hosey was able to get the Hoover City Council to amend its zoning ordinance to allow short-term rentals in light industrial zones, but she still must get conditional use approval from the Hoover Planning and Zoning Commission and Hoover City Council for this particular project.\n\nHBH Realty also is getting ready to open an eight-suite bed and breakfast in Helena called Buck Creek BnB in May."

        "content": "SOL and BNB are both native tokens of their own blockchain, and are used as gas to pay for transactions. More than that though, SOL and BNB also represent the people\u2019s sentiment on the Solana (SOL) Chain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nBy Advertiser, in Crypto \u00b7 29 Apr 2023, 09:01 \u00b7 0 Comments\n\nThese chains allow people to access the world of decentralized finance and NFTs. Collateral Network (COLT) also brings DeFi to the people, making it simple for borrowers and lenders around the world to unlock cash from their physical assets, whilst cutting out the bank. COLT is in the second stage of its presale which has witnessed a 40% surge in price to $0.014.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana (SOL) Pay - the next Apple Pay? Or PayPal?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fast speeds of Solana (SOL) make it an ideal candidate to make digital payments seamless and usable in day to day life. As anyone who is familiar with crypto will know, the actual process of doing certain things with crypto or paying for things in the real world, is much more difficult than is required for mass adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\nPayPal changed the online payments world and now a more cost effective solution is needed, as small businesses feel the squeeze of the less than ideal exchange rates, and fees. With this in mind, Solana (SOL) has the potential to make a significant impact, particularly with the launch of Solana Pay approximately a year ago. Solana Pay is a payment service from Solana (SOL) that enables merchants and consumers to transact directly, bypassing the need for expensive intermediaries. It uses the Solana (SOL) native SOL token and fees are tiny.\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless there are drawbacks and risks. Solana (SOL) has regular outages and other problems including a recent unplanned \u2018forking event\u2019. Until Solana (SOL) Labs can sort out its tech, it seems unlikely that Solana (SOL) will become a mainstream payment provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nPancakeSwap V3 to be released on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in April\n\n\n\n\n\nPancakeSwap is one of the oldest DEXes, and the first place that most on-chain newbies come to buy or exchange a new and exciting token. Whilst there may be cheaper DEXes for everyday exchanges, PancakeSwap is easily available through Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and has almost every new coin on the BNB blockchain. With V3 will come increased liquidity provider rewards and exclusive (non tradeable) NFTs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC) invested heavily in PancakeSwap last June, showing their commitment to the most famous of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) DEXes. This launch is likely to get many DeFi lovers back on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and buying and using BNB, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) native gas token. BNB prices are also affected by the amount of trading on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) CEX, since BNB is used to pay for transaction fees on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\n\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) shows promise and is in stage 2 of its presale\n\n\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is pioneering the concept of creating NFTs backed by physical assets, which can then be divided into fractions through fractionalisation and then sold to the community to finance peer-to-peer loans. These NFTs can be used to represent almost any physical asset, including supercars, fine art and watches to name a few, and provides a quicker route for obtaining loans than traditional institutions through Collateral Network (COLT).\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike banks who reuse your money many times over after you deposit it, and also, bizarrely, get to use the value of your loans to make more money, these NFTs are backed 1-1 by the asset they represent through Collateral Network (COLT). This provides a simple but effective solution for those looking for capital or cash flow in a hurry, as cash is received for the asset within 24 hours. Collateral Network (COLT) also gives the opportunity for ordinary people to make money in the form of interest from lending towards the NFTs in order to raise the money for the loans for borrowers on the Collateral Network (COLT) platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOLT is the native token of the Collateral Network (COLT) platform and allows trading discounts and access to better rates of interest. Presale COLT holders will be given a special bonus that allows them access to auctions of distressed assets - assets which are given a lower valuation due to the need for a quick sale from borrowers defaulting on their loan repayments back to lenders\u2019. Collateral Network (COLT) tokens are purchasable at $0.014 and experts predict a potential 3500% surge from here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\n"
