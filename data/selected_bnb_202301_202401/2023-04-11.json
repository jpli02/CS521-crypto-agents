        "content": "Binance\u2019s BNB chain boasts over 1 million daily active users, surpassing other popular blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nDespite impressive growth and adoption metrics, the price of BNB remains bearish.\n\nDespite numerous challenges, Binance\u2019s BNB chain remained unfazed and thrived. Recent data has revealed that the BNB chain is head-to-head with established blockchains like Ethereum. Despite the obstacles, Binance is proving its mettle.\n\nRead Binance Coin (BNB) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBinance BNB chain leads active address metric\n\nAccording to a recent report by Coin98, the Binance BNB chain has taken the lead as the top blockchain network with the highest number of daily active users.\n\nThe chart indicated that the BNB chain had surpassed other popular blockchains like Polygon and Ethereum. Impressively, the BNB chain boasted over 1 million daily active users, while the second-ranking chain had half that number.\n\nA closer look at the BNB chain addresses on Bscscan showed that the active addresses on the network were on the rise. Despite reaching its highest number of active addresses in March, with over 1.9 million, the current count still exceeded the numbers recorded in January.\n\nBNB chain unique addresses rise\n\nAccording to data from Messari, the Binance BNB chain had cumulatively onboarded 274 million unique users, whereas Ethereum had onboarded 226 million.\n\nNotably, the BNB chain had onboarded users at an average month-on-month rate of 6% over the past year, while Ethereum\u2019s rate had declined by an average of 5%.\n\nAdditionally, the BSCscan data revealed that the BNB chain had experienced a daily increase of over 300,000 unique addresses. Furthermore, data from Flipside indicated that the BNB chain had 10.36 million unique addresses in February alone, highlighting the network\u2019s impressive growth and user adoption.\n\nBinance BNB price trend remains bearish\n\nDespite the positive growth and adoption metrics of the Binance BNB chain, its price has yet to reflect this trend. At press time, trading at around $312, the price of BNB was experiencing a minor loss in value.\n\nFurthermore, the coin is currently stuck in a bearish trend as it has been unable to rise above the neutral line on the Relative Strength Index (RSI).\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BNB Profit Calculator\n\nOne possible explanation for the disconnect between the Binance BNB chain\u2019s impressive growth metrics and its current price could be a decline in transaction fees.\n\nRecent data from the chain indicated that there had been a decrease in transaction fees in 2023. As of this writing, the transaction fee stood at over 1,800, which was relatively low compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nThis decline in transaction fees could impact the price of BNB, as lower fees may result in reduced revenue for the network and its validators."

        "content": "First BNB Greenfield testnet goes live, community calls for builders to revolutionize data ownership\n\nPor staff\n\n11/04/2023\n\nBNB Greenfield\u2019s first testnet codenamed \u201cCongo\u201d went live on April 10th, 2023. As a bridge connecting the BNB Chain ecosystem and the trillion-dollar decentralized storage market, BNB Greenfield is committed to revolutionize user data freedom and control in a community-driven, open-source, and distributed way for the growing Web3 community.\n\nDecentralized storage is crucial for the dApp world. Greenfield strives to provide fast, cost-effective data service, comparable to Web 2 cloud storage, encouraging widespread adoption. With testnet Validators and Storage Providers (SPs) network, seamless BNB Smart Chain integration, Greenfield offers a user experience similar to Web2 storage but with better performance. It also ensures greater data ownership, enhanced anti-censorship, and better native integration with Web3 apps and data.\n\nVictor Genin, Senior Solution Architect at BNB Chain said, \u201cAs a decentralized ecosystem, BNB Chain is calling for the community to come forward as we seek builders to contribute and try out the Congo Testnet. Developers will be able to choose to store data anywhere, from decentralized terminals to centralized storage services while validators will be instrumental in shaping the future of data ownership and utility in web3.\u201d\n\nGreenfield testnet Storage Providers (SPs) work with testnet validators to offer complete storage service. SPs store actual data, while validators handle metadata and financial ledger through consensus. To become an SP, they must deposit a \u201cService Stake\u201d on the Greenfield blockchain and be voted for by validators during a governance process. This design ensures efficient user data storage, data redundancy and security, while the PoS mechanism of the validator layer guarantees decentralized governance.\n\nBNB Greenfield excels in data storage and native integration with the BNB Chain ecosystem, unlocking a Web3 data economy by giving users true data ownership. The BNB Chain, with over 1,400 active dApps and 200 million unique addresses, holds vast potential for a thriving data economy.\n\nSee more: Smart ports market is predicted to touch US$ 16 billion by 2033\n\nInitial features allow users and developers a smooth transition to decentralized storage. Data permissions can be moved cross-chain to BSC, turning them into tradable digital assets and integrating with existing DeFi, NFT, GameFi, and SociaFi apps on BSC. Users can interact with BNB Greenfield to create wallets and manage data, while developers gain full control and ownership of their data assets. They can set access and conditions, manually or programmatically, while leveraging their data for financial gain.A native relayer links BSC and Greenfield, enabling BSC Dapps to integrate with Greenfield using a simple SDK and minimal development. Upon Greenfield mainnet launch, thousands of Dapp data sets will be available, fostering rapid ecosystem growth and easing data-related innovation compared to other chains.\n\nBNB, the native token, serves as a gas and governance token for BNB Greenfield. Validators stake BNB, take part in governance, and earn revenue from storage fees. Users create accounts, transfer BNB, manage storage resources, and use native cross-chain communication between BSC and Greenfield. BNB token usage in data storage and trading will increase its value over time.\n\nBNB, formerly just the native token of BNB Smart Chain, now has new roles and aims to unlock more possibilities. The global data storage market, valued at USD 217.02 Billion in 2022, is projected to reach USD 777.98 Billion by 2030. As BNB Greenfield\u2019s ecosystem expands, it will unlock new opportunities and use cases focused on data. By merging strong on-chain guarantees with advanced decentralized storage technology, BNB Greenfield and BNB will grow together, playing a key role in introducing the next billion users to the web3 world.\n\nThe future of data storage and ownership has arrived, and BNB Greenfield is leading the charge. Don\u2019t miss out on this transformative moment in decentralized technology \u2013 join the BNB Greenfield testnet today and be a part of the data revolution!\n\nAll BNB Greenfield documentation and examples can be accessed here and thanks to community member NodeReal, leading web3 infrastructure solutions provider, you can now access block explorer and Dcellar, a BNB Greenfield client. All projects are welcome to develop their business cases as well as developer tools for the BNB Greenfield by extending the open-sourced repository. Developers can also participate in the Zero2Hero Hackathon\u2019s Greenfield track and apply for grants to build on Greenfield. To learn how to be part of the Testnet as a validator, check out the guidelines here and learn how to create a Storage Provider to get started."
