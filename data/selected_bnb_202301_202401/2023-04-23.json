        "title": "Bitcoin Price Forms \u201cLocal Top\u201d, Minor Correction Expected, Pundit Avers - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAfter a steady decline since Wednesday, Bitcoin traded flatly throughout the weekend despite recovering slightly on Saturday. In the past week, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost over 8% of its value. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,644, up 1.27% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBTCUSD Chart by TradingView\n\nWhy is Bitcoin Falling?\n\nApart from crypto-industry-focused uncertainties that have afflicted the wider digital asset market, Bitcoin\u2019s gradual descent can be attributed to the selling activities of miners.\n\nOn Sunday, \u201cTarek\u201d, an analyst for Cryptoquant, noted that Bitcoin\u2019s drop has brought its price closer to the cost of mining, which is currently around $27,200. This has prompted miners to offload their coins, resulting in downward pressure on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cWe notice an increase in the miner outflow index and the selling index of miners, along with a decrease in miners\u2019 reserve. All of this indicates selling pressure from miners during the past few days,\u201d he wrote, sharing a Bitcoin Miners Position Index (MPI) chart, which has been increasing.\n\nHe, however, advised investors against panicking, noting that he expects the selling pressure to subside around $27,200-$26,600.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLocal Top\u201d is in for Bitcoin\n\nJA Maartum, another Cryptoquant analyst, notes the recent uptick in the activity of movement of \u201cancient\u201d Bitcoin or dormant addresses could signal a \u201clocal top\u201d for Bitcoin.\n\nIn trading, a local top refers to a point in an asset\u2019s price chart where the price peaks before starting to decline. This peak represents a level of resistance where the price has trouble breaking through and continuing to rise. After reaching the local top, the price typically retraces, creating a short-term bearish trend.\n\nAccording to Maartum, while it\u2019s rare for dormant addresses to be moving around, considering they are still significantly profitable in dollar terms at current market prices, they occasionally re-enter circulation to take profits.\n\n\u201cThis is a rare occurrence, and it typically happens around market tops (when the market crashes) or bottoms (when old Bitcoin capitulates, such as during the FTX crash). And it happened yesterday as well. 6,000 BTC with an age between 7 and 10 years moved. This could be a sign of a local top,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat said, while Bitcoin has been experiencing a minor correction, various experts expect the cryptocurrency to bounce back soon, considering that most fundamentals remain strong. According to Caleb Franzen, a senior market analyst at Cubic Analytics, Bitcoin needs to reclaim $27,820 to establish a bullish move.\n\nIn a recent post, the pundit highlighted the cryptocurrency\u2019s 12 and 24-month Williams %R oscillators, which he noted are no longer \u201coversold\u201d. According to him, this has \u201chistorically meant that the lows of the BTC bear market are in & that a new bull market is starting.\u201d"

        "content": "'Why do you keep catering to them?': 'Sister Wives' fans slam Meri Brown after Kody and Robyn Brown were spotted at her BNB\n\nAfter Kody and Robyn Brown were spotted at Meri Brown's Lizzie's Heritage Inn, fans were quick to come up with different theories regarding the visit\n\nPAROWAN, UTAH: It seems Kody Brown and his wife Robyn Brown recently met Meri Brown at Lizzie's Heritage Inn. Or did they just visit Meri's BNB? A fan recently spotted the couple at Parowan, Utah, entering Lizzie's Heritage Inn.\n\n'Sister Wives' star Meri has been recently been in the news ever since Christine got engaged to David Woolley. She has been posting cryptic messages on social media for a long time now. However, after Kody and Robyn were spotted at her BNB, fans were quick to come up with different theories. Some wondered about financial issues, while some slammed Meri for catering to her ex.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nMeri Brown's cryptic post about 'pain' leaves fans wondering if she's shading Christine Brown's engagement\n\nDid TLC star Meri Brown get a secret glow-up? Fans speculate plastic surgery behind radiant selfie\n\nKody and Robyn Brown (Youtube/TLC)\n\nKody and Robyn Brown spotted at Meri Brown's BNB Lizzie's Heritage Inn\n\nA fan started a Reddit thread on Saturday, April 22, 2023, with the title, \"Just saw Kody and film crew moving stuff at Meri's bnb.\" The fan further explained the entire incident. He claimed, \"We are on a trip to Vegas and we're driving past parawon and decided to drive by meris bnb just for shits and gigs and saw Kody & film crew and possibly Robyn moving a piano as well as a huge moving truck.\" The fan added, \"I wonder if meri is selling her bnb. We took videos but you can't see Kody.\" This was something that fans never expected to happen.\n\n'Why do you keep catering to them?'\n\nAs the thread opened, fans started building their own theories and expressed their view on Kody and Robyn visiting Meri's BNB. A fan slammed Meri and said, \"Why Meri\u2049\ufe0f\u2049\ufe0f\u2049\ufe0f Why do you keep catering to them???? I don't think she'll ever stop.\" Another replied to this, \"She\u2019s probably doing it strictly for financial reasons. Any sort of romantic links between them died out what seems like decades ago. But if Meri and K/R stick together - they all become relevant again. They have more power together - and more of a steady paycheck. I think this is all manufactured for filming. In real life, Meri is very much living her own life - just like Janelle and Christine.\"\n\n\"I like the thought of Meri refusing to finance CP but offering up the B&B for their downsizing needs. For aa small fee,\" commented another fan. A fan joked, \"Meri hired kody and Robyn cuz they needed jobs and she needed cheap labor.\" A fan wondered, \"With everything Meri went through to get the BnB, she ain't selling it!\"\n\nA few fans speculated whether the 'Sister Wives' stars are filming again. A fan commented, \"Someone else posted a video of themselves driving by the B&B and they were filming.\" As of now, nothing has been cleared about why Kody and Robyn went to Meri's BNB.\n\nThis article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations. MEAWW cannot confirm them independently and does not support claims or opinions being made online."

        "content": "BNB\n\nExplore the latest advancements in BNB Chain ecosystem, including Greenfield testnet, reduced transaction costs, MEV research, Planck upgrade, Cocos-BCX & NodeReal Optimism solution, and upcoming technical improvements.\n\nUpdates and Developments\n\nThe BNB Chain ecosystem has been bustling with activity in the first part of 2023, with several significant developments and technological advancements taking place. In this article, we'll take a closer look at some of the updates that have occurred on the platform.\n\nBNB Greenfield is now underway.\n\nGreenfield Testnet\n\nThe Greenfield testnet is an open-source project that aims to provide a scalable and efficient data availability layer for decentralized applications (dApps). This testnet is now live, giving developers a chance to test their dApps on the platform and contribute to its development. The Greenfield testnet offers developers powerful tools for creating innovative solutions and exploring the full capabilities of the BNB Chain. The testnet is a significant milestone for the platform, and we invite more developers to explore its capabilities and join the thriving BNB Chain community.\n\nReduced Transaction Costs\n\nBSC validators have reduced transaction costs from 5 Gwei to 3 Gwei following extensive discussions. This reduction in fees will help drive network adoption, making BNB Chain an even more attractive platform for developers and users. The lower transaction costs will undoubtedly benefit the platform, making it more accessible and affordable for developers to create innovative solutions.\n\nMEV Research on BSC\n\nBSC recently hosted a Tech Community Call focused on Miner Extractable Value (MEV) research. The discussions showcased the active interest in addressing MEV-related issues on BSC, and more researchers and developers are invited to join the ongoing MEV research efforts on BNB Chain. This research is crucial to improving the platform's security and ensuring its continued growth and success.\n\nWith regular upgrades, BSC continues to make important progress.\n\nPlanck Upgrade\n\nThe Planck hard fork upgrade includes two crucial BEPs, BEP-171 and BEP-172, aimed at improving security and network stability. Additionally, the platform is working on an Integration API for EIP-4337 bundlers with L2 validators/sequencers, which will extend the \"sendRawTransaction\" RPC request with additional parameters and checks to ensure that no network changes could cause the transaction to revert. These upgrades are essential to maintaining a secure and stable platform for developers and users.\n\nCocos-BCX & NodeReal Optimism Solution\n\nThe collaboration between Cocos-BCX and NodeReal has resulted in an Optimism solution for the BNB Chain. This collaboration offers developers powerful tools for creating Web3 games and applications. This solution will help attract new developers to the platform and expand the range of applications that can be created on the BNB Chain.\n\nUpcoming Technical Improvements\n\nTwo significant upcoming projects are the OpBNB testnet, planned for mid-May, and the ZkBNB mainnet, scheduled for June 1st. These projects will further enhance the capabilities of the BNB Chain ecosystem, offering developers even more opportunities to innovate. Additionally, the BEP-206 proposal aims to optimize BSC storage through the hybrid state mode, which will enhance efficiency and scalability for the platform.\n\nIn conclusion, the BNB Chain developer community continues to push the boundaries of innovation with recent updates, collaborations, and upcoming projects. BNB Chain offers an array of opportunities for developers to build groundbreaking solutions, and we encourage more developers to join the BNB Chain ecosystem, contribute to its growth, and shape the future of blockchain technology.\n\nWhat is BNB Chain:\n\nPreviously known as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BNB Chain is a community-driven, decentralized, and censorship-resistant blockchain that is powered by Binance. It consists of BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain, EVM compatible and facilitating a multi-chain ecosystem. Through the concept of MetaFI, BNB Chain aims to build the infrastructure to power the world\u2019s parallel virtual ecosystem.\n\n\u200d\n\nFind more about BNB Chain here:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Discord | Telegram | GitHub |"
