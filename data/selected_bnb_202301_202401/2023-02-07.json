        "content": "This post was updated Feb. 7 at 7:57 p.m.\n\nSometimes a secluded Airbnb is not the best choice for a vacation spot.\n\n\n\nUC San Diego alumnus Robert Mann\u2019s film \u201cR BnB\u201d follows the stories of three women \u2013 Mia (Bryanna McQueeney), Aubree (Savannah Whitten) and Jennifer (Gloria Mann) \u2013 whose lives are closely intertwined because of mutually warped female desires. Arriving from Manhattan, Mia and her husband choose to celebrate their first wedding anniversary at the Airbnb that Aubree owns but quickly realize nothing is as it seems when they discover they are secretly being videotaped.\n\nPrior to the film\u2019s premiere at Westwood\u2019s Regency Bruin Theatre on Tuesday, Mann spoke with the Daily Bruin\u2019s Lex Wang about his inspirations behind developing the psychological thriller and how the movie reflects the intricate workings of society.\n\n\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n[Related: Q&A: \u201cThe People We Hate at the Wedding\u201d screenwriters, cast navigate family dynamics]\n\nDaily Bruin: How would you describe \u201cR BnB?\u201d\n\nRobert Mann: \u201cR BnB\u201d is a psychological thriller, and it\u2019s about a rich couple from Manhattan, and they go to a secluded Airbnb. When they get there, they realize they\u2019re being videotaped and spied on, and they try to make a run for it. Then everything hits the fan, so to speak.\n\nThe story is really about three women with stories that converge, unbeknownst to me when I was writing it. I just thought I was writing about a couple. But once I started writing the story \u2013 and it really wasn\u2019t until I was editing the movie \u2013 that I realized the protagonist is female and the subplots are really about the other two female leads. So when I was editing, that was a revelation to me. That\u2019s how \u2026 the art or the writing of the movie process goes sometimes \u2013 you don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re doing until it manifests itself.\n\nDB: What was your favorite scene in the film? What did the creative process of directing that scene look like?\n\nRM: Every scene and everything are like little babies to me, so it\u2019s really hard to pick. But I\u2019ll tell you one that I think is really nice and an emotional scene. It\u2019s when one of the leads \u2013 Aubree, who\u2019s the owner of the Airbnb \u2013 has this nice wonderful little soliloquy. She really tells you the reason why all of this nefarious action is happening, and she has a wonderful, heartfelt and emotional, tearful scene.\n\nAnother one that I really, really love is between the two women, Mia and Aubree. We shot that with a waterfall behind them. That\u2019s a really wonderful one too. \u2026 She (Aubree) has nefarious intentions, and she\u2019s doing this little fishing expedition with Mia, who\u2019s unsuspecting. We start to unveil that relationship, so that was really one of my favorite scenes too.\n\n[Related: Sundance 2023 Q&A: Producer Maria Altamirano talks \u2018All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt\u2019]\n\nDB: What do you hope audiences take away from your film?\n\nRM: I hope for 81 minutes, they forget life and they just are entertained. It\u2019s entertainment. It\u2019s just people that want to get away for a little bit, forget life and have a thrill. And I think for a thriller, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the objective. There are moments and you\u2019ll see them, but that\u2019s not the objective. The objective for me was to make a nice thriller that people could then enjoy. People are \u201cconsumers.\u201d Just like anything that you eat, it\u2019s enjoyable. It\u2019s the same thing with this. They\u2019re going to consume it, and hopefully, they will enjoy it. John Lennon said the role of the artist really isn\u2019t to teach or to show. It\u2019s actually just to reflect society, and I think that\u2019s what the film does. It reflects our position in society right now. You\u2019ll take out of it whatever you take out of it."

        "content": "WEB3\n\nFind out what the biggest DEXes are on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Polygon and Avalanche. Did you guess Uniswap, PancakeSwap and Trader Joe?\n\nEthereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche\n\nDecentralized Exchanges (DEX) are, of course, an integral part of the crypto sector. With the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX/Alameda empire and other high-profile incidences involving Centralized Exchanges, DEXes have gained even more attention in the past year.\n\nHere is a quick overview of the five most active blockchains, in terms of 7-day DEX volume, and the biggest DEX on each of those chains, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\n1. Ethereum ($10.91B)\n\nTop DEX : Uniswap\n\n: Uniswap 7-Day Volume : $7.63 billion\n\n: $7.63 billion Share of Total DEX Volume on Chain: 70%\n\n2. BNB Chain ($2.54B)\n\nTop DEX : PancakeSwap\n\n: PancakeSwap 7-Day Volume : $2.13 billion\n\n: $2.13 billion Share of Total DEX Volume on Chain: 84%\n\n3. Arbitrum ($1.55B)\n\nTop DEX : Uniswap\n\n: Uniswap 7-Day Volume : $881 million\n\n: $881 million Share of Total DEX Volume on Chain: 57%\n\n4.

Avalanche ($662M)\n\nTop DEX : Trader Joe\n\n: Trader Joe 7-Day Volume : $302 million\n\n: $302 million Share of Total DEX Volume on Chain: 46%\n\nWhile those figures might not be surprising to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) buffs, it gives an idea of the weight classes of the major contenders in the developing Battle of the DEXes on BNB Chain , as Uniswap, Trader Joe and a host of native challengers are seeking to topple PancakeSwap from its long-held position atop the blockchain.\n\nThe chefs at PancakeSwap are responding with plans of their own, most notably a v3 upgrade on BNB Chain as well as expansionary expeditions to other chains, including Ethereum and Aptos.\n\nWhat is BNB Chain:\n\nPreviously known as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BNB Chain is a community-driven, decentralized, and censorship-resistant blockchain that is powered by Binance. It consists of BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain, EVM compatible and facilitating a multi-chain ecosystem. Through the concept of MetaFI, BNB Chain aims to build the infrastructure to power the world\u2019s parallel virtual ecosystem.\n\nFind more about BNB Chain here:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Discord | Telegram | GitHub |\n\nWhat is PancakeSwap:\n\nPancakeSwap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on BNB Chain and available multichain on Ethereum and Aptos. It offers users various features such as Liquidity Pools (LPs), swapping, yield farming, Syrup Pools, an Automated Market Maker , Initial Farm Offerings (IFOs), an NFT profile system, and other tools. In addition, the protocol helps users make the most out of their crypto assets by trading, earning through yield farming, and winning via lottery, prediction, and NFT collectibles. With the highest trading volumes in the market, PancakeSwap is the leading DEX on BNB Chain.\n\nWhere to find PancakeSwap:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Medium | GitHub |\n\nWhat is Uniswap:\n\nUniswap was launched in November 2018 and has grown to become the largest decentralized exchange in its category. It was built open-source on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the AMM model to facilitate Ethereum ERC-20 token swaps. Uniswap\n\nMuch of the progress made in Ethereum-based DeFi expansion is attributable to Uniswap as it provided the market-making utility for Web3 apps to function in a decentralized environment. The platform consistently records daily trade volumes of over half a billion dollars and has a total volume locked (TVL) of more than $3 billion. The platform has traded over $1 trillion since it launched via over 129 million transactions.\n\nWhere to find Uniswap:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Discord |"
