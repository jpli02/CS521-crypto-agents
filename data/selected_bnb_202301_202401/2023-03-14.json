        "content": "BNB Price Prediction | Photo by Binance Blog\n\nBNB climbed higher above $285 and $300. The price is showing bullish signs and might easily rise toward the $325 resistance.\n\nBNB Price Aims Higher\n\nIn the past few days, there was a steady increase in BNB price against the US Dollar, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price formed a base near the $265 level and climbed above the $280 resistance.\n\nThere was a break above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance near $285 on the 4-hours chart. The bulls were able to pump the price above the $300 resistance zone and the 50-day simple moving average (blue).\n\nBNB price 4-hours chart | Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe upward move was such that the price climbed above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $327 swing high to $264 low. The price is now trading above the $300 resistance zone and the 50 simple moving average (blue, 4-hours).\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $312 zone. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $327 swing high to $264 low.\n\nThe next major resistance could be near the $320 level. The main hurdle is near the $325 level. A clear move above the $320 and $325 resistance levels might start another decent increase. In the stated case, the price might test $340. Any more gains might send the price toward the $350 level.\n\nDownside Correction?\n\nIf not, BNB price might start a downside correction from the $312 zone. An initial support is near the $300 level. The next major support is near the $290 zone, below which the price might test the 50 simple moving average (blue, 4-hours). Any more losses could open the doors for a move toward the $265 support zone.\n\nOverall, BNB price is moving higher and showing a lot of positive signs above the $300 pivot level. If there is a clear move above the $312 resistance, the price might easily drift toward the $325 level or even $340 in the coming days. Conversely, there is a risk of a downside correction toward the $290 support or even $280 in the near term."

        "content": "Margaret Barnes , 71, had been down in Barmouth, visiting friends when she had a few drinks and returned to what she thought was her hotel - but she accidentally entered David Redfern's home\n\nWoman, 71, who mistook house for B&B died after 'being dragged outside by angry owner'\n\nA homeowner is claimed to have found a drunk, semi-naked woman on the side of his bed and dragged her down the stairs, causing her fatal injuries.\n\nDavid Redfern, 46, is on trial for murdering Margaret Barnes, 71 after he allegedly mistook her for a thief in his home in Barmouth, Gwynedd.\n\nThe elderly holidaymaker is said to have mistook his house for a seaside hotel and she undressed, unpacked and climbed into bed at his house.\n\nBut when Redfern spotted her, the court heard that he flew into a rage and called her a \u201cthieving c***\u201d before he grabbed her by her feet and dragged her out of his house, tossing her suitcase out too.\n\nHe was said to have found the \u201cfrail\u201d pensioner half naked, with her possessions strewn across the room, and her false teeth on the bedside table before the prosecution said he stamped on her and kicked her as he threw her out onto the street.\n\nImage: WALES NEWS SERVICE) WALES NEWS SERVICE) Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE) WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nThe court heard that she had just \u201csimply mistook\u201d his large five-storey seaside home for her hotel after travelling over 100 miles from Birmingham for a holiday on the coast in Wales and having had a drink.\n\nThe prosecution said she suffered injuries comparable to a high-speed crash and collapsed and died outside the house, despite the best efforts of neighbours to save her.\n\nThe retired factory worker had booked into the Wavecrest BnB, several doors down from Redfern's Belmont House in Barmouth.\n\nThe large house had formerly been a hotel before Redfern and his partner renovated it.\n\nThe court was told Mrs Barnes was staying in Barmouth to visit friends and had been seen drinking at bars in the hours before she died.\n\nProsecutor Jones said: \"Mrs Barnes had been drinking and, whether she thought this was the Wavecrest, she went in and went to bed. She mistook the defendant's address for the B&B but it was a mistake which ultimately cost her her life.\"\n\nImage: WALES NEWS SERVICE) WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nShe went into an upstairs bedroom, took out her false teeth and put them on a bedside table and poured a gin into a glass while holding a bottle of tonic, the court heard.\n\nBut the prosecution claim that when Redfern and partner Nicola Learoyd-Lewis came in they found the \"frail\" pensioner there \"semi-naked on the side of the bed\" with her belongings strewn across the flood in a mess.\n\nThe jury was told Mrs Barnes had mistakenly gone to that house while being \u201cintoxicated\u201d, and gone straight to a bedroom, where she fell asleep.\n\n\u201cIt was a mistake that ultimately cost her her life,\u201d said Mr Jones.\n\nRedfern was 6ft 1in tall weighing 21 stone at the time of her death in July last year.\n\nImage: WALES NEWS SERVICE) WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nThe jury was told Redfern had \u201cself-confessed anger issues\u201d - and his reaction was \u201cout of all proportion\u201d.\n\nMr Jones said: \u201cIt would have been unexpected to find the elderly woman asleep in their bed. He pulled her down the stairs by the ankles. He intentionally stamped on her or kicked her.\u201d\n\nMr Jones said it led to \u201ccatastrophic\u201d injuries to her liver, and broke a number of ribs. He compared her injuries to a high-speed car crash.\n\nMrs Barnes was left outside where her case had been thrown by Redfern who then \"mocked her as she began complaining of chest pains.\u201d\n\nMrs Barnes fell unconscious, and went into cardiac arrest as neighbours tried to resuscitate her. She died at the scene from \"traumatic injuries\".\n\nImage: WALES NEWS SERVICE) WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nA post-mortem examination found she had a traumatic liver injury, and was bleeding extensively internally.\n\nRedfern told police in interviews that Mrs Barnes, of Baldwins Lane, Birmingham had been aggressive and had lunged at his partner.\n\nThe prosecution said Redfern would claim he had tripped or fallen on Mrs Barnes - and denied kicking her.\n\nBut Mr Jones added: \u201cThe reason Mrs Barnes died is she had the misfortune of coming across a man who was an angry bully.\u201d\n\nImage: WALES NEWS SERVICE) WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nShe was identified to police by her husband Raymond.\n\nIn a tribute her family said: \"Margaret was a devoted wife, and the best mother, grandmother and sister anyone could ask for. She always had a smile on her face and was always caring, loving and willing to help anyone especially her family who she cherished.\n\n\"She has been cruelly taken from us far too early. She will be sorely missed and we can honestly say that our lives without her will never be the same again.\u2019\"\n\nRedfern, of Barmouth, denies both the murder or manslaughter of Mrs Barnes.\n\nThe trial at Caernarfon Crown Court is expected to last about three weeks."
