        "content": "With many of the 100,000-plus who cram into Tuscaloosa for Alabama football game days, hotels are booked solid and that has been a boon for temporary housing from the likes of Air B&B.\n\nThe Crimson Tide has its own version of Air B and B \u2014 the receiving duo of Jermaine Burton and Isaiah Bond.\n\nBurton was a known commodity coming in after his 2022 performance after transferring from Georgia. Also coming to Bama last season from Georgia \u2014 famed Buford High School \u2014 was Bond.\n\nThe two are tied for the Alabama team lead in receptions this year with 23 each, Burton for 508 yards and five touchdowns, Bond for 360 and 3 TDs.\n\nMost recent for Bond was the 46-yard touchdown catch from Jalen Milroe on the second play of Alabama\u2019s 34-20 win over Tennessee in Bryant-Denny Stadium last week.\n\nThe numbers 47-34-52-46 aren\u2019t the contrived signal calls from an old football movie. Those are the lengths of some of Bond\u2019s receptions this year. As a freshman he had 17 catches for 220 yards, a long of 53 yards, and one touchdown, that score the beginning of the Crimson Tide\u2019s 45-20 win over Kansas State in the Sugar Bowl.\n\nNext up after this week\u2019s open date is a critical Southeastern Conference West Division game against LSU on Nov. 4 in Bryant-Denny Stadium. Alabama is 7-1 overall and leading the West with a 5-0 conference record, LSU 6-2 and 4-1. CBS will televise the game beginning at 6:45 CDT.\n\n\u201cBond. Isaiah Bond.\u201d I don\u2019t know who initiated that take on 007 (it sounds like something Tide broadcaster Chris Stewart would have come up with), but it fits.\n\nBond has a knack for being in the right place \u2014 notably, behind opposing defensive backs, to make those killer plays. How does he do it? In his first meeting with reporters at Alabama this week, Bond answered a question honestly. \u201cYes sir. I would say I\u2019m the fastest guy on the team.\u201d\n\nAs a junior in high school he won the 6A 100- and 200-meter state titles.\n\nA lot goes in to a successful pass \u2014 protection, route, throw, catch.\n\nBond gives a lot of credit to his quarterback, Jalen Milroe, pointing out that Milroe has replaced the No. 1 player in this year\u2019s NFL draft, former Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young.\n\n\u201cJalen has shown great improvement, just getting better,\u201d Bond said.\n\n\u201cI think honestly just the raw talent that Jalen Milroe has to be able to throw the ball deep. Obviously, physical look-wise, you see he\u2019s a bigger dude, bigger quarterback and also he has great receivers as well, that are able to stretch the field so it\u2019s a tale of two ends.\n\n\u201cI believe in Jalen Milroe and I believe in where this team can go.\u201d\n\nBuilding chemistry between the quarterback and receivers started in the summer, when they worked together in Tampa.\n\nBond said, \u201cHonestly,I\u2019m excited to play every single down, but obviously you do get a little more excited when a pass is coming. But I\u2019m excited all the time when I\u2019m on the field playing for The University of Alabama.\u201d\n\nKnowing the pass was coming in the start of the second half, Bond said, \u201cMy mama always told me, \u2018Big time players make big time plays,\u2019 so it\u2019s going out there and believing in my training I\u2019ve done my whole life and knowing I\u2019m capable of going there and making a play to change the game is what really stuck with me.\n\n\u201cMy mindset on a deep route is just run as fast as I can down the field and put my trust in Jalen Milroe to get the ball out there. I believe in myself to go out there and make plays, so getting to the spot at the right time. Timing is a big part that plays into deep passes.\u201d\n\nAlthough the long touchdown pass receptions are the ones that make the highlight video, midway through the second quarter against Tennessee Bond caught a short pass and started down the sideline where a Tennessee defender waited for him. After the collision, Bond was back in the huddle. The defender was headed to the sideline, stopping twice to collect himself.\n\n\u201cComing from the South, physicality is kind of something that\u2019s instilled in you young,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even though you might say I\u2019m not the biggest wide receiver (he\u2019s 5-11, 182), I play as if I was 6-4, 200 pounds.\u201d\n\nBond has been a pleasant surprise, and may have another one coming.\n\nHe returned punts in high school and works on that skill in practice at Alabama.\n\n\u201cYou should be seeing me soon,\u201d he said."
