        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe public testnet for Zircuit, a novel zero-knowledge rollup supported by groundbreaking L2 research, was made available today. All Ethereum dApps and wallets are supported by Zircuit, which is completely EVM compatible and enables the deployment of any Ethereum dApp on Zircuit with little modification. On Monday, November 13th, Zircuit will hold a multi-day event during Devconnect to commemorate the launch.\n\nThe Zircuit team has led several research efforts over the past 1.5 years, including rollup compression, security tooling, and scalable cryptography. As a result of this study, the Ethereum Foundation funded funding for research on Layer 2 (L2). The team\u2019s latest technological innovations and research findings are combined in Zircuit\u2019s impending testnet to provide developers with an advanced L2 environment.\n\nUtilizing these developments in research, Zircuit employs a hybrid strategy that blends optimistic infrastructure with the most recent zero-knowledge proofs. Creating new compression algorithms speeds up transactions and saves users\u2019 gas while more effective proof generation lowers fees. With this cutting-edge integration, developers can easily transfer well-known dApps to Zircuit without making expensive modifications.\n\nBefore releasing their dApps on the Ethereum mainnet, developers can test them in an ideal environment with Zircuit. Zircuit\u2019s sequencer-level security prevents unauthorized transactions while enabling developers to detect attempted hacking. For developers looking to test something new, Zircuit offers a low-risk, quick solution because setup only takes a few minutes, and transactions are inexpensive.\n\nZircuit\u2019s exclusive rollup and ZK technology combo offer end users a more efficient experience. Without requiring learning a new programming language or framework, Ethereum apps may effortlessly deploy onto Zircuit, allowing Zircuit to readily stay up to date when popular Ethereum applications receive changes. Because of this compatibility, users may take advantage of these dApps\u2019 increased features, speed, and cost savings without needing to pick up any additional skills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur research on rollups led us to create an L2 scaling solution that is breaking new ground and paving the way for a new generation of rollups. It\u2019s taking the existing technology further and easing use for developers and dApp users,\u201d said Dr. Jan Gorzny, Head of L2 Scaling at Zircuit.\n\nDevelopers and projects from all throughout the web3 ecosystem are welcome to join Zircuit\u2019s testnet. Projects will get help and rewards, including developer training, readiness support, and onboarding.\n\nZircuit is holding a four-day event at Devconnect where guests may interact with the Zircuit team, learn more about the testnet launch, and socialize with other web3 community members. You can get tickets at https://lu.ma/zircuitcafe.\n\nVisit zircuit.com or docs.zircuit.com to read the developer docs for additional information about Zircuit."
