        "content": "Here are some tricks every trader can use to reduce the fees they pay.\n\n1. Deposit fiat using a bank transfer if possible\n\nMost cryptocurrency exchanges let you transfer fiat currency (traditional money like U.S. dollars) using a bank transfer for free. Credit card payments are almost always more costly, especially as you may pay an additional fee to the card issuer. Debit card payments can cost less, so if this is your preferred method of payment, look for a platform with low debit card fees. If you already own cryptocurrency and want to trade it for Binance Coin, it should be free to deposit crypto directly to your account.\n\n2. Compare \"test\" trades before you commit to anything\n\nCryptocurrency trading fees can be confusing. Plus, each platform uses different fee structures, so it's difficult to compare. Some platforms charge a set dollar amount per trade, while others charge a percentage. Some also charge a high spread -- the difference between the buy and sell prices quoted for that crypto. This is often hidden, or only clear when you make the transaction, but it could mean you end up with less BNB for your buck.\n\nOne surefire way to know which crypto exchange will give you the lowest fees is to experiment. Find out how much BNB you would get for, say $100, on the platforms you might use. The results can be surprising. You don't need to deposit any money to view a sample trade (though you may need to create an account).\n\n3. Understand withdrawal fees from the outset\n\nWithdrawal fees can take a significant chunk out of your profits. Nobody wants to get hit by huge fees when they want to access their money. Think about how you plan to withdraw your assets and look for the platform that will do it cheaply. Some platforms offer free withdrawals, which might give them the edge over their competitors.\n\nIf you're withdrawing dollars to a bank account, you may find you'll pay as much as 1% on the total -- or a set amount such as $25 per withdrawal. Crypto-to-crypto withdrawals are often cheaper, but that depends on which crypto. For example, withdrawing BNB on the Binance Smart Chain might cost $0.20, whereas withdrawing ETH using the Ethereum network could cost $15 or more."

(WTVD) -- The floor of the Raleigh Convention Center was filled with booths and eager vendors looking for sales or leads on the final day of the Downtown Raleigh Home Show.\n\nAll the available options attracted people like April Gibson, who spoke with ABC11 while checking out some tiny homes on display.\n\n\"I'm thinking about retiring, maybe in a few years, and I'm just trying to figure out what's the best options,\" she said. \"Because you get a lot of brochures from senior living, they're like $2000? I can sell my home and pay for one of these, cash. I can get one, Air BNB it out, make some extra cash and when I'm ready, I can move in.\"\n\nAmong the crowd were people who were shopping, not buying, because they lacked adequate funding for housing at the Triangle's current market rates. Others want to stay in their homes, but they're hesitate because improvements are pricey.\n\nRealtor Becky Dunn said after pandemic related supply chain issues, people with plans to build or refresh homes face more challenges.\n\n\"Having legitimate contractors come out that have staff that'll be there,\" Dunn said. \"They might be there on Monday but they don't show up on Friday. And so to finish a project in a timely manner, it's not so much supply chain as it is staffing issues.\"\n\nBut for those of more modest means, military veteran Chad Livingston sees possibilities for refreshing living spaces by purchasing his handmade scented candles.\n\n\"You know, we always find money for the things that make our homes better. You're going to live there, so you might as well make it comfortable,\" said Livingston."

Bitcoin hit its highest peak since August on Thursday. BTC traded at the US$25,250 level.However, BTC could not sustain the gains and fell back to the US$23,000 level after the PPI data release, which was higher than expected, raising concerns among investors and traders over the inflation.Whenever there is a fear of inflation, BTC falls as it does not like it. Investors run short of funds to spend when interest rates go up. Hence BTC falls. Despite the decline, BTC is up by more than 72% from its cycle\u2019s lowest point in January.Compared to the BTC\u2019s all-time high, it is nearly 65% down. However, on Saturday BTC bounced back to the US$24,600 level. If the initiative continues, we might see it touch US$25,000 again the coming week.The second largest cryptocurrency , Ethereum, has also traded in line with BTC this week. Ethereum touched above the US$1,700 level on Thursday and fell to US$1,600 post the PPI\u2019s data release. On Saturday, ETH again is trying to attempt to break above the US$1700 level trading very close to it. Ethereum has gained more than 86% from its lowest point at US$893 in June last year. However, it was down by 66% from it's all-time high of US$4,899 in October 2021. There is also a drop in ETH available ahead of the Shanghai availability on exchanges.On the other hand, XRP also rallied due to the ongoing SEC-Ripple lawsuit, and though it could not last there, the rally soon subsided.

A report from Glassnode noted that the Ordinals NFTs had contributed to a short-term upside in the Bitcoin network\u2019s usage, bringing many new active users with non-zero addresses onto the network.The German tech giant Siemens is the latest player in the digital securities space, following the issuance of a $65 million bond with a one-year maturity on the Polygon blockchain.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing cryptos over the past week:1.
