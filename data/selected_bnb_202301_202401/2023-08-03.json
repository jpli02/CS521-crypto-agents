        "content": "BNB\u2019s momentum is shifting to the bearish side. The bulls are starting to feel the pressure.\n\nKey Support levels: $230\n\nKey Resistance levels: $260\n\n1. Flat Trend About to End\n\nBNB is stuck in a flat channel. This is a consolidation period that will likely end in a violent breakout once the price decides on a direction. With good support at $230 and resistance at $260, it seems market participants have a hard time breaking these key levels right now.\n\n2. Sellers Could Return\n\nThis latest daily candle is a bearish engulfing one, which signals that sellers have the upper hand right now. This is not encouraging, particularly as momentum appears to shift in their favor. If so, it might be the case that the key support will be put under pressure soon.\n\n3. Bearish Cross?\n\nThe daily MACD is already giving clear signs of weakness in the price action with an imminent bearish cross if buyers don\u2019t return. This could shift momentum and turn the chart bearish again, which would continue the downtrend that started in early June.\n\nBias\n\nThe bias for BNB is bearish.\n\nShort-Term Prediction for BNB Price\n\nThe key support continues to hold, but its resilience could soon be put to the test by the bears. In case of failure there, BNB could revisit $200 in August."

        "title": "How to Fix Internal JSON-RPC Error on Metamask - Latest Cryptocurrency Prices & Articles",
        "content": "Encountering an internal JSON-RPC error can be a frustrating roadblock for users navigating the world of decentralized applications and blockchain networks.\n\nEven more, when using popular platforms like MetaMask or exploring sidechains and custom networks, these errors can disrupt your seamless experience and leave you wondering how to resolve them.\n\nSo, from troubleshooting steps on MetaMask to essential best practices for handling sidechain and custom network errors, this article covers all the crucial information to help you resolve internal JSON-RPC errors with ease.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in!\n\nWhat is Internal JSON-RPC Error?\n\nJSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation, is a simple way for computers to share data between a server (a powerful computer on the internet) and a web app or mobile app.\n\nRPC stands for Remote Procedure Call, a method for computer networks to ask another computer or server to perform a specific task and get the results back.\n\nJSON-RPC is like a clever blend of JSON and RPC. It uses JSON\u2019s easy-to-understand data format to package the requests and responses and RPC\u2019s method to call functions on the server from the app and get the desired outcomes. This way, they can communicate and work together smoothly. Instead, when this does not happen like that, an internal JSON-RPC error appears.\n\nSo, in simple terms, Internal JSON-RPC Error is an error message that appears when two computer programs use the JSON-RPC protocol to talk to each other (as a communication protocol), but these programs fail to communicate properly.\n\nThis error is often associated with MetaMask Wallet, but not only.\n\nSIDENOTE. MetaMask is a self-custodial digital wallet (crypto wallet) that works as a browser plugin designed for storing Ether and other ERC-20 tokens. With MetaMask, you can easily send and receive these cryptocurrencies, making transactions with any Ethereum address hassle-free.\n\nUsually, crypto wallets like MetaMask use JSON-RPC to communicate smoothly with the DApps they are connected to. Additionally, MetaMask uses the JSON-RPC protocol to interact with the blockchain networks you\u2019ve added to your wallet.\n\nWhy Internal JSON-RPC Error Occurs?\n\nThis error occurs when something goes wrong inside one of the programs while they talk.\n\nIt could be because of a mistake in the program\u2019s code, a setting not set up correctly, or some other issue preventing the programs from communicating properly.\n\nThe error message will give some clues about what went wrong, but it might be hard to figure out and fix without technical knowledge. However, we\u2019ll try to make it as easy as possible for you to understand how to solve this problem.\n\nAs this error occurs most frequently with MetaMask, especially when trying to detect the Ledger hardware wallet, we\u2019ll start by explaining what you need to do to fix this problem with MetaMask, and then with various other Sidechains and Custom Networks.\n\nHowever, before moving forward with the process, ensure that both MetaMask (whether it\u2019s the app or web extension) and your Ledger Nano X or Nano S hardware wallet, along with Ledger Live, are up-to-date with the latest versions. After updating, we suggest clearing your cookies and restarting your laptop or desktop.\n\nHow to Fix Internal JSON-RPC Error?\n\nHow to Fix Internal JSON-RPC Error on MetaMask\n\nEncountering various JSON-RPC error codes on your MetaMask wallet can happen due to multiple reasons, making it challenging to have a one-size-fits-all solution. The specific method to resolve the error depends on the underlying cause.\n\nTo help you address the internal JSON-RPC error on your MetaMask wallet, we\u2019ve provided some potential fixes below that you can try out.\n\nThese fixes are also recommended by MetaMask, so (in theory) they should solve your problems:\n\n1. Make Sure the Network Has Been Added Properly\n\nThe internal JSON-RPC error on MetaMask is often caused by incorrectly adding networks to your wallet. If you add a network with the wrong details, you\u2019ll likely encounter this error when trying to make a transaction.\n\nTo avoid this problem, you must be cautious while adding any new network to your MetaMask wallet. Double-check the details to prevent mistakes. Alternatively, you can use ChainList, a service that automatically adds networks to your MetaMask wallet, ensuring a smoother experience.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide for adding a network to your MetaMask wallet using ChainList:\n\nOpen the ChainList website in a new browser tab.\n\nClick on the \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d button.\n\nChoose an account from the MetaMask window.\n\nApprove the connection request.\n\nSearch for the specific network you wish to add to your wallet.\n\nClick on the \u201cAdd to MetaMask\u201d button.\n\nConfirm the action by clicking \u201cApprove\u201d in the MetaMask window.\n\nFinally, click \u201cSwitch Network\u201d to switch to the newly added network.\n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t want to add a new network automatically using ChainList, you can add a new network manually using the following steps:\n\nClick the \u201cAdd Network\u201d button on the network selector section.\n\nPress the \u201cAdd a network manually\u201d button.\n\nComplete the fields and click the \u201cSave\u201d button.\n\nIf you face an RPC error while trying to execute a transaction on a specific network, you can try resolving it by removing the network from your wallet and then carefully adding it back manually or through ChainList.\n\nKeep in mind that for the Ethereum Mainnet, which is set as the default network on your wallet, you can\u2019t remove or re-add it. In such cases, you may want to explore other methods to address the issue.\n\n2. Make Sure You Have Sufficient Native Tokens from That Network to Cover Gas Fees\n\nAnother possible reason for encountering the internal JSON-RPC error while attempting a transaction on MetaMask is insufficient native tokens to cover the associated gas fees.\n\nWhenever you make a transaction on MetaMask, you must have enough native tokens of that particular network to pay the transaction\u2019s gas fees. You\u2019ll encounter an error if the tokens in your wallet are insufficient to cover the gas fees.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can simply send additional native tokens of the network you\u2019re transacting on to your MetaMask wallet. Once you have enough tokens to cover the gas fees, try executing the transaction again, and the error should be resolved.\n\n3. Make Sure You Are Using the Most Recent Version of the App or Extension\n\nIf you have enough native tokens to cover the gas fees for your transaction and all networks in your MetaMask wallet were added correctly, updating the MetaMask extension or mobile app is another method you can try to fix the JSON-RPC error.\n\nTo update the MetaMask browser extension on Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the MetaMask extension page on the Chrome web store.\n\nCheck if there is a button that says, \u201cRemove from Chrome.\u201d If you see this button, it means MetaMask is already up to date. Otherwise, you can update the extension from there.\n\nTo update the MetaMask mobile app, follow these steps:\n\nDepending on your device, visit the MetaMask app page on the App Store or the Google Play Store.\n\nClick the \u201cUpdate\u201d button to update the app to the latest version.\n\n4. Make Sure to Connect Your Hardware Wallet Properly\n\nAnother common reason for encountering the internal JSON-RPC error on MetaMask is when your hardware wallet is not connected properly to your MetaMask wallet. MetaMask relies on the JSON-RPC protocol to communicate with hardware wallets that are linked to your wallet.\n\nSo, if the problem persists (and especially if it is closely related to Ledger detection), try following these steps:\n\nOpen your web browser and locate the MetaMask icon.\n\nClick on the top right corner button, and from the dropdown menu, click on \u201cSettings.\u201d\n\nIn the Settings section, click on \u201cAdvanced.\u201d\n\nLook for the option that says, \u201cPreferred Ledger connection type\u201d and from the dropdown menu, select \u201cLedger Live.\u201d This enables the Ledger Live bridge.\n\nGo back to your MetaMask wallet, press on your account, and select \u201cHardware Wallet.\u201d\n\nChoose \u201cLedger\u201d from the options and click \u201cConnect.\u201d\n\nAn \u201cOpen Device Bridge\u201d window will pop up in Ledger Live. Click \u201cOpen.\u201d\n\nOnce you complete these steps, the bridge between Ledger Live and MetaMask should be activated. This allows you to connect and use your Ledger device with MetaMask easily.\n\nHow to Fix Internal JSON-RPC Error on Sidechains or Custom Networks\n\nInternal JSON-RPC errors can occur when interacting with sidechains or custom networks. These technologies work alongside the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling the transfer of crypto assets/tokens between different networks.\n\nMetaMask is vital in the Ethereum ecosystem, facilitating seamless transitions between networks.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to be aware of common issues that can arise while dealing with sidechains. To help you avoid such problems, we\u2019ve outlined six best practices for handling sidechains (also recommended by MetaMask):\n\nDo Your Research \u2013 Not all networks are equally secure. Custom networks may offer faster and cheaper transactions but may have different security guarantees than the mainnet. Understand the risks before moving significant value to a custom network. Trust the Network Provider \u2013 Ensure that you trust the network provider, as a malicious one can misrepresent the state of the blockchain, withhold transactions, and potentially record your activity and IP address. Verify Network Information \u2013 When adding a custom network to MetaMask, use trusted sources like to add it automatically. If adding manually, double-check the accuracy of the information and consider following verification guidelines. Use Established Bridges or Portals \u2013 Using reliable bridges or portals to move tokens between different networks. MetaMask does not track cross-network transactions, so be cautious and trust the network operator and the Ethereum address you\u2019re sending funds. Avoid Direct Token Transfers between Networks \u2013 Sending crypto assets directly from one network to another may lead to permanent and irreversible loss of assets. Use bridges instead to transfer assets safely. Understand Gas Fees on Different Networks \u2013 Remember that transaction fees are paid in the native token of your specific network. Ensure you have enough native tokens for sending or swapping transactions.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is Internal JSON-RPC Error?\n\nThe Internal JSON-RPC Error is an error message that occurs when two computer programs attempt to communicate using the JSON-RPC protocol but encounter a problem during the communication process, leading to unsuccessful data exchange.\n\nHow to Fix Internal JSON-RPC Error?\n\nIf you encounter an internal JSON-RPC error on MetaMask, ensure that the network has been added correctly and you have enough native tokens to cover gas fees. Additionally, update MetaMask to the latest version and verify the proper connection of your hardware wallet.\n\nFor errors related to sidechains or custom networks, follow best practices: conduct research on the network\u2019s reliability, trust reputable providers, use established bridges or portals for transfers, avoid direct token transfers between networks, and understand gas fees on different networks. These steps should help you address and resolve the internal JSON-RPC error.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nNavigating the world of blockchain networks and decentralized applications may come with its fair share of challenges, and encountering internal JSON-RPC errors can be one of them. However, armed with the insights and solutions provided in this guide, you are now better prepared to tackle these issues head-on.\n\nBy applying these practical tips and fixes presented in this article, you can minimize downtime and ensure a smoother experience while exploring decentralized technologies\u2019 vast and exciting landscape.\n\nShare this Post Twitter\n\nLinkedin\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n* The information in this article and the links provided are for general information purposes only and should not constitute any financial or investment advice.
