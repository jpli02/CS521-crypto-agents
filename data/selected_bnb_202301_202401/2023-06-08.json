        "content": "Bitcoin was back in the blue on Thursday amid a wider crypto decline that swept up altcoins mentioned and unmentioned in the Securities and Exchange (SEC) lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase earlier this week. Investors appear to price in the latest regulatory body blows against an industry already reeling from assorted debacles.\n\nBitcoin was back in the red as the largest crypto token dropped about 2 per cent barely holding the $26,000 mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also in down as it declined more than 2 per cent and slipped below the $1,850 mark once again. However, the pain in the altcoins was severe.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin experienced a drop below the $26,400 threshold due to the ongoing tensions between SEC and Binance and Coinbase. Despite attempts, BTC failed to recover beyond the $27,000 mark. Presently, BTC's support rests at the $26,200 level, while resistance is observed at the $26,600 level,\" said Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"If the immediate resistance is successfully surpassed, it may propel the price even higher. Concurrently, many altcoins also recorded declines in the past day. The second largest cryptocurrency is currently being traded at the $1,830 level. ETH continues to face difficulties in surpassing the $1,900 resistance level as bears are active around this threshold,\" he further said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged stablecoin Tether, all other top crypto tokens were trading sharply lower on Thursday. Solana tanked more than 8 per cent, whereas BNB and Cardano dropped 7 per cent each. Polygon declined 6 per cent, while Avalanche was down 4 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply lower, falling down to the $1.1 trillion mark as it dropped more than 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes tumbled more than 16 per cent to $38.18 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin recently witnessed a significant drop, while some altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Lido (LDO) managed to recover from the previous fall in value as well, this price movement hasn't been mirrored by several altcoins that failed to respond in a similar manner, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"Banking infrastructure giant, SWIFT's collaboration with blockchain infrastructure firm Chainlink marks a significant step towards enhanced blockchain interoperability. With Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), banks are now testing secure transactions on multiple blockchains using a single interface,\" it further stated.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\n\n\nStella, previously called Alpha Finance, offers a borrowing cost of 0% whose primary goal is to revolutionize the mechanics of leveraged DeFi. By fostering increased utilization of these foundational components, Stella aims to facilitate the emergence of new protocols and innovative solutions that can leverage the abundant liquidity and strong infrastructure available.\n\nImage: Chart-Stella\n\n\n\nOn the weekly timeframe, the ALPHA/USDT trend had been consolidating around $0.1 levels since April of this year. The weekly chart has broken above the descending trendline with a buying volume surge. Immediate support is expected at 0.115 USDT and the next resistance is expected at 0.155 USDT.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Christy Carlson Romano Talks PodCo During ATX TV Fest 2023 - True Hollywood Talk",
        "content": "This interview was conducted by Andrew Rossow, Esq. and Jhanelle Dionne.\n\nLaunched twelve years ago by Emily Gipson and Caitlin McFarland, ATX TV Festival is an annual festival in Austin, Texas that has since developed into a year-round event that is entirely focused on the television medium via its most engaging programming that brings together industry leaders and fans every June for a four-day event that consists of panels, premiere screenings, and late-night events.\n\nTrue Hollywood Talk attended this year\u2019s ATX TV Fest Season 12, which among the many panels and discussions, brought podcast programming front-and-center.\n\nDuring this year\u2019s ATX TV Fest, The Podcast Company (PodCo) certainly sparked waves of conversations as its sweet, ever-expanding line of podcast programming brings together many of the former Disney Channel child stars who have worked hard to build something that\u2019s entirely their own \u2013 putting their Disney character personas behind them to have those uncomfortable conversations and discussions that play a much bigger part in our everyday lives.\n\nPodCo, a podcast production startup, founded by former Disney Channel star Christy Carlson Romano (Even Stevens, Kim Possible, The Vulnerable Podcast) and her husband, Brendan Rooney (The Vulnerable Podcast, I Hear Voices Podcast), has undeniably carved out a niche that is hard to compete with, bringing together a spectacular lineup of podcasts hosted by former Disney Channel stars and their journeys in navigating adulthood beyond the characters they\u2019ve played on television for years.\n\nSince its February launch, PodCo now plays host to:\n\nThe Wizards of Waverly Pod, hosted by Jennifer Stone and David DeLuise;\n\nNed\u2019s Declassified Podcast Survival Guide, hosted by Devon Werkheiser, Lindsey Shaw, and Daniel Curtis Lee;\n\nThe Brotherly Love Podcast, hosted by Joey, Matt, and Andy Lawrence; and\n\nThe Even More Stevens Podcast, hosted by Romano, Nick Spano, and Steven Anthony Lawrence\n\nBearing Witness to That Intimate Moment\n\nDuring ATX TV Fest, Romano and Anneliese van der Pol (That\u2019s So Raven) announced the launch of PodCo\u2019s latest podcast \u2013 the BNB Podcast, which will discuss topics surrounding vulnerability, parenthood, musical theater, their time on Disney Channel, as well as the current status of the world.\n\nTrue Hollywood Talk sat down with both Romano and van der Pol, diving into vulnerability, authenticity, and adulthood.\n\nAs for van der Pol and Romano coming together, van der Pol told True Hollywood Talk that their lives have \u201cparalleled each other in a weird way,\u201d and this was an opportunity for them both to explore a friendship they always wanted, but were never given the chance to experience.\n\n\u201cWe were sort of robbed of a friendship, and we like each other a lot, and always knew that,\u201d said van der Pol. \u201cWhen I came on to do Vulnerable, we realized we weren\u2019t being so vulnerable; we were having a lot of fun, and I think [Christy] is ready to take a bit of a departure from that.\u201d Anneliese van der Pol to True Hollywood Talk\n\nThe Vulnerable Podcast, hosted by Romano, invites her friends, celebrities, and experts for in-depth conversations discussing the good, the complicated, and beauty of being human, while exploring the nuances of vulnerability.\n\nOne of the things that Romano says will distinguish BNB Podcast from a lot of the \u201cgirl duos\u201d that are really wonderful and trending\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve literally been everyone\u2019s big sister or role models for a long time, but they\u2019ve never had the chance to talk to us,\u201d Romano told True Hollywood Talk.\n\n\u201cThe note that I get a lot from folks, is that podcasting as a whole is so popular and has such a great future ahead of it because you\u2019re sharing an intimate moment, you\u2019re bearing witness to people that you really would love to listen to. I think we\u2019re offering a way in for folks that maybe grew up with us and really want to know what we think about the industry,\u201d she continued. Christy Carlson Romano to True Hollywood Talk\n\nvan der Pol also added the point that when people come to the program to listen to them, they know they\u2019re going to be getting the truth, while also having the ability to showcase her own voice independent of Disney.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t care about being famous\u2026it doesn\u2019t bring me any joy. I really just want to be a person in the world talking and having a voice that\u2019s my own voice. I do think I have something to say and people who would want to listen,\u201d she stated.\n\nRomano jumped in, emphasizing that \u201c[w]hat we want to do with this show is to give [Anneliese] a platform to be herself and to shine,\u201d Romano emphasized, noting that we\u2019re no longer in an \u201cinfluencer culture, but instead, a creator market where if you\u2019re creating something special and unique that is \u201cauthentically you, then there\u2019s a place for that now.\u201d\n\nHair Color For Women and Becoming \u201cAuthentically You\u201d\n\nFans of van der Pol who grew up watching her play \u2018Chelsea\u2019 on Disney Channel\u2019s That\u2019s So Raven, often associated her with her red hair, which during the show, she said she purposely changed to blonde.\n\n\u201cOne thing I think she did great was changing her hair color, because everyone knew her as a redhead,\u201d Romano said. \u201cI think it\u2019s so funny how there\u2019s certain things you do in hair color for women, which is something else we should talk about on the program.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to being authentically you, hair color for women and men, is an equally important piece to the puzzle of understanding you.\n\nWe briefly spoke about Disney\u2019s live-action film of \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d starring Halle Bailey as Ariel, which is now out on Disney+, and how it\u2019s already left its mark on pop culture in more ways than one.\n\nSince the original animated movie\u2019s release in 1989, fans of \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d have come to expect any depiction of Ariel to \u201clook\u201d a certain way \u2013 including how her hair and makeup are done.\n\nOscar-nominated celebrity hairstylist Camille Friend, who was responsible for creating Bailey\u2019s hairstyle to play the live-action Ariel, did so with intention.\n\nWhile there were widespread discussions from people on wanting to see Bailey rock the bright cherry red hair that the OG Ariel has always exhibited, the move away from tradition and taking into consideration what was best for Bailey, was a priority for Friend.\n\nFriend told PopSugar that when the topic of hair color came up, she was concerned about dyeing Bailey\u2019s entire head red and the damage it would cause. So, Friend came up with a workaround solution, partnering with Extensions Plus, which provided three custom shades of red, 30-inch hair extensions made to encase Bailey\u2019s locs.\n\n\u201cWe just started mixing the colors, starting from darker and working to lighter and, literally, taking and wrapping each of her locs with this hair,\u201d Friend said. According to Friend, that process required a total of three stylists and took two days, which allowed for it to stay in Bailey\u2019s hair for six to eight weeks.\n\nBy mixing the three different shades of red, Friend and the makeup team were able to completely transform Bailey\u2019s brown hair into Ariel\u2019s red hue, which gives off golden-orange reds to help bring out the golden-sunshiny color out of Bailey\u2019s skin.\n\nBeing a Mom (And Not Being a Mom)\n\nWhen it comes to exploring the complexities and nuances with today\u2019s understanding of \u2018identity,\u2019 the two co-hosts bring a unique perspective to the program when it comes to motherhood and independence.\n\nWe asked Romano and van der Pol for their advice to parents and kids who do have that dream of wanting to get into the industry:\n\n\u201cI am making sure that my daughters have an appreciation for the arts first, before commodifying it. I think that it\u2019s important that they just love it \u2013 that they love just being in a theater. What I think most importantly is ambition. Ambition in children is so rare, but if you have an ambitious child, you have to serve that ambition to them, because it\u2019s healthy for them. Hopefully along the way, they aren\u2019t so ambitious that they lose sight of their values and their agency, but overall, when it comes to the parent and the choices to do this, this isn\u2019t an after-school activity,\u201d Romano emphasized.\n\nvan der Pol says one of the biggest pieces of advice she can share with parents (and kids) revolves around the amount of \u201cpower\u201d that presents itself when you\u2019re making people laugh and bringing in large sums of money:\n\n\u201cI had a very smart mother, a mother who was a big avid arts-goer, theater watcher, anything and everything. She told me all the right things, but it still didn\u2019t matter, because when you\u2019re making all of that money young, and you\u2019re making people laugh, you\u2019re so powerful. You have so much power (or you think you do), and you\u2019re an adult taking care of your family,\u201d van der Pol told True Hollywood Talk. I would just keep telling myself \u2018girl, you\u2019re not an adult, and this isn\u2019t going to last. Just because you\u2019re naturally talented, doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have to work hard. I would have told myself not to drink and make so many mistakes, to be honest.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have told myself to focus more and do better. I made a lot of mistakes,\u201d van der Pol confessed.\n\n\u201cAre you grateful for any of those mistakes? Do you ever go back and say \u2018I\u2019m glad I fucked up in that area, because it created this new perspective?\u201d Romano asked van der Pol.\n\n\u201cI wish I could, but no, I think regrets are important. And I have a lot of them. I actually think all the mistakes I made were a detriment \u2013 I drank too much, I dated older guys on set. Disney was really freaked out about that, because I was dating a much older guy when I was 18, and that ruined it. They didn\u2019t trust me anymore, it worried them. But, no, I wish I hadn\u2019t made those mistakes, unless it\u2019s a good thing that I\u2019ve learned from it now and am able to tell you that,\u201d van der Pol replied.\n\nHow Should Listeners Approach PodCo Programming?\n\nWith a pretty stacked lineup of podcasts already embedded within PodCo\u2019s programming, and more on the way, how should listeners approach each of these shows as a homegrown company in Austin, Texas?"
