        "title": "BNB VS BUSD \u2013 What\u2019s The Difference? - Tekedia",
        "content": "There are now two cryptocurrencies available on Binance: Binance Coin (BNB) and Binance USD (BUSD).\n\nGiven that each has unique qualities, it begs the issue of why both are seen as essential components of the Binance ecosystem.\n\nWhat are the differences between BNB and BUSD, and can they be used interchangeably?\n\nDespite the fact that Binance founded both, their goals are very different. In addition to facilitating transactions (including the conversion of BUSD to BNB) and providing trading fee incentives on the platform, BNB serves as the utility token for the Binance Exchange and Binance Smart Chain. The BUSD cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is categorized as a stablecoin with a value that is closely tied to the US dollar and is intended for usage in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe differences between these two cryptocurrencies are clarified by the thorough comparison that follows:\n\nUse Cases\n\nBinance Coin was initially only used to get rebates on trading commissions. Reducing fees by using BNB was a benefit that persisted at a 25% discount until 2022, after which it would gradually drop from 25% to 6.75% during the succeeding years. BNB\u2019s utility was expanded with the launch of the Binance Smart Chain, which later served as the engine for the whole Binance ecosystem. Pancakeswap became as one of the most well-known initiatives thanks to its expansion, which enabled a number of other projects. BNB also acts as an authorization mechanism for transactions on the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nThe BUSD Stablecoin\n\nBUSD, on the other hand, performs as a stablecoin since its value is inextricably linked to the US dollar. As a result, 1 BUSD seeks to precisely equal 1 USD. BUSD has a higher percentage of cash and cash equivalents, making up 96% of its reserves, compared to other stablecoins like USDT, which only have 2.9% of their reserves in cash. The redemption of 1 BUSD should theoretically result in the payment of 1 USD because the value of BUSD is directly supported by the US dollar. It\u2019s crucial to remember that BUSD abides by strict rules and complies with the requirements of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). BUSD has the ability to spark interest while being mostly utilized as a trading pair with other cryptocurrencies.\n\nCorporate Support for BNB and BUSD\n\nBinance Exchange introduced BNB as its utility token back in 2017. In contrast, Binance developed BUSD in partnership with Paxos, a financial services company based in New York. All of the US currency backing the BUSD reserves is pledged as security. It\u2019s important to note that the establishment of BUSD came two years after that of BNB.\n\nStability of Value\n\nBUSD experiences significantly fewer price volatility than BNB because it is a stablecoin. Due to Binance\u2019s practice of buying and burning BNB tokens, which effectively reduces their supply and creates the possibility of price fluctuations, BNB\u2019s value is more volatile. BNB is therefore the more uncertain token to possess. However, keeping BNB for a long time may result in appreciation for individuals who have faith in the Binance ecosystem.\n\nExisting Trading Pairings\n\nTrading any cryptocurrency on Changehero.io is feasible using either BNB or BUSD, making it possible to convert BTC to BNB or other cryptocurrencies. BNB and BUSD are widely accepted on the site for buying a wide range of cryptocurrencies because Binance developed both of them. The price of BNB\u2019s trading pairs can be more volatile, which could affect how much Bitcoin one buys; in contrast, the price of BUSD\u2019s trading pairings tends to be more stable.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "Metis Provides Retribution for Users Affected by PolyNetwork Bridge Exploit - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Metis to distribute 117,000 METIS tokens to users affected by last month's exploit, while simultaneously implementing Layer Zero's OFT architecture for METIS tokens on other chains.\n\nTORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / September 14, 2023 / Today, Metis announced a two-part plan to support community members affected by the hack of third-party bridge, PolyNetwork, which took place on July 1st. Metis is allocating 117,000 METIS from protocol-owned liquidity in order to compensate affected users.\n\nBackground\n\nOn July 1st, a malicious actor managed to mint and pull all available liquidity on PolyNetwork. The hacker minted 8,882,912 METIS on BNB Chain using the bridge's mint and burn function. Metis responded quickly, pulling all liquidity from PancakeSwap and Stargate as a temporary security measure. Liquidity was also removed from Netswap and the PolyNetwork bridge was shut down, leaving little to no liquidity for either token, which led to the hacker only being able to steal 117,000 METIS tokens from users' funds.\n\nFortunately, because the rest of the newly minted METIS tokens had no way out of the BNB Chain and there was no significant METIS liquidity, the exploit had no impact on total supply or circulating supply of METIS on the Ethereum or Metis networks. This means users on neither network were directly affected. However, users holding METIS tokens on BNBChain were affected, as there was no liquidity available for swapping and no active liquidity pools following the exploit. Retribution in vested tokens is being provided to take into consideration unaffected users and provide a balanced distribution model.\n\nRecompensation Plan\n\nMetis will be issuing on demand 117,000 rMETIS tokens in order to compensate affected users in a responsible manner. The rMETIS token is a receipt token backed 1:1 by 117,000 METIS tokens allocated by the MetisDAO Foundation.\n\nOn the first day of deployment of the vesting contract, set for 14 September 2023, 1 rMetis token will be equal to 0.5 METIS, gradually scaling up to full 1:1 parity after 14 September 2024. Users who claim their rMetis tokens will be able to redeem whenever they wish for an equivalent amount of METIS relative to the time of redemption.\n\nCommunity members whose funds were affected by the exploit have until 14 October 2024 to claim their share of rMetis tokens.\n\nOFT METIS Token\n\nPreviously, users interacting with the METIS token on other chains besides Metis and Ethereum Mainnet, were interacting with wrapped versions of METIS, which didn't count with the same security assumptions as native METIS does.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn order to provide a safer alternative to METIS holders on other blockchains, Metis has upgraded its cross-chain token structure to the innovative OFT model developed by LayerZero.\n\nUsers will be able to own real METIS on the other chains OFT is launched on (Metis, BNB and Avalanche, to start). Users who supply USDT to the \"USDT by Metis\" pool on BNB will earn real Metis rewards, not a wrapped bridge version. Among other opportunities for holders, this will allow integration of real and native Metis into cross-chain applications; seamless bridging without LP requirements. The DEXes that will be trading Metis on each participating chain include Hermes, Unimaia, Hummus, Netswap, and Hera.\n\nAbout Metis\n\nMetis is an EVM-Equivalent Ethereum Layer-2 protocol focused on bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. Metis provides users with a secure, decentralized, and scalable easy-to-use network. By combining a robust Layer 2 with on-chain credentials and Decentralized Autonomous Companies (DACs), Metis is building the perfect ecosystem to host open and trustless collaboration, secured by Ethereum.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nColin Landers\n\ncolin@energentmedia.net\n\nSOURCE: Metis\n\n\n\n\n\nView source version on accesswire.com:\n\nhttps://www.accesswire.com/783423/metis-provides-retribution-for-users-affected-by-polynetwork-bridge-exploit\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nIt\u2019s 4am and the repetitive thwack of the wooden hand drum known as a moktak reverberates around the temple pavilion. As alarms go, it\u2019s relatively gentle, but no one could sleep through the cacophonous wake-up call that follows, as a bell clangs 28 times and monks rhythmically strike an enormous drum, wooden fish and a cloud-shaped gong to ensure salvation for all the creatures in the world. It\u2019s not something you can silence by hitting the snooze button.\n\nIt\u2019s my cue to leave the futon on the floor of my simple room to join the temple\u2019s monks in their morning chanting ceremony, singing verses to Buddha and his teachings. Intermittently, we prostrate ourselves before a trio of five-metre gilded Buddha statues and a smaller 15th-century effigy.\n\nOutside, the early morning sun lights up the wooden temple buildings, a 10-storey pagoda said to house relics of the Buddha himself, and a riot of purple and gold chrysanthemums. Beyond the courtyard, rays glint off the windows of multi-storey blocks \u2014 we might be in an oasis of tranquillity, but this particular oasis lies in the heart of Seoul, South Korea\u2019s buzzing capital.\n\nBuddhist monks at Jogyesa Temple in Seoul \u00a9 Alamy\n\nThis is Jogyesa, the central temple of Korean Buddhism and one of nearly 1,000 traditional temples peppered throughout the country. Of those, 27 now allow English-speaking visitors to stay the night under the \u201ctemplestay\u201d programme, delivering a dose of authentic culture in a country better known for its K-pop and K-dramas than its traditions. Rates typically start at about $60 per person per night.\n\nToday, the monasteries are attracting more overnight guests searching for a slice of inner peace, often as a one-night add-on to a more conventional holiday, but also for longer stays, or with several strung together to form a monastic tour. \u201cOur programme is an antidote to tiredness and busy lives,\u201d says Hye Won, one of two nuns and 18 monks at Jogyesa. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking the slow lane and finding stillness of the mind.\u201d\n\nThe temple certainly proves to be an antidote to the busy thrum of Seoul, with its skyscrapers and shopping malls, neon lights and night markets, even though there are a surprising number of cultural sites amid the modernity.\n\nThey include the 14th-century royal palace of Gyeongbokgung, which was partially destroyed during the Japanese occupation between 1910 and 1945 before a painstaking (and ongoing) restoration was begun in the 1990s. Now, it\u2019s a major tourism draw. On my visit it overflows with photo-snapping Koreans dressed in traditional national costume, making a marked contrast with the more serene Jogyesa, to which I retreat a few hours later.\n\nThe painstakingly restored 14th-century Gyeongbokgung palace in Seoul \u00a9 Alamy\n\nAs in other temples, overnight guests share some of the monks\u2019 daily routine, including morning and evening chanting, tea ceremonies and meditation. I can meditate in my en suite room, too, with its superb view over the courtyard and a sound machine that can be programmed to play the noise of rainfall or waves.\n\nMeals might be vegetarian, accompanied by water (alcohol is banned), but the food is beautifully tasty. In fact, since nun Jeong Kwan from Baekyangsa monastery featured on Netflix\u2019s Chef\u2019s Table, it\u2019s been almost impossible to get a booking at that particular temple stay. Certainly it\u2019s not difficult to follow the rule of eating everything on your plate.\n\nThe entrance of Seoul\u2019s Gyeongbokgung Palace \u00a9 Getty Images\n\nHowever, a full stomach makes my postprandial activity, the 108 prostrations, even more challenging. Described as meditation in motion in which humbling the ego helps you realise your true self, each descent to the floor is accompanied by a different prayer. My legs are starting to wobble by the time I reach number 24 (reflecting on whether I have lived in unnecessary luxury and vanity). The irony of number 85 isn\u2019t lost on me \u2014 to stay composed under duress \u2014 and by 105, with my legs in spasms, I\u2019m not sure I can \u201cbe grateful for overwhelming happiness of this moment of bowing\u201d. I do, though, feel a huge sense of achievement as I curl up on my futon that night.\n\nThe next day, after a breakfast of seaweed soup with rice balls and kimchi (way better than it sounds), I board the bullet train to travel 270km south to Gyeongju, capital of the ancient Silla kingdom (57BC to 935AD). This is a city surrounded by rolling hills dotted with so many tombs, temples, rock carvings and pagodas that it would take days to explore them all.\n\nInterior view of the Seokguram Grotto and Bulguksa Temple \u00a9 Alamy\n\nA Buddha statue and prayer mat inside the Bulguksa Temple (built c774) in Gyeongsang province . . . . . . and a large traditional drum under the ornately carved beams of its cloisters \u00a9 Alamy\n\nChief among them are the Unesco-listed Seokguram Grotto with its granite Buddha statue gazing out over the pine trees to sea, and Bulguksa Temple, an architectural representation of paradise rising symmetrically from a lotus lake. Both were established in the 8th century on the slopes of Mount Toham.\n\nIt\u2019s busy here at sunset, and the crowds really ramp up after dark at Anapji Pond, an ancient pleasure garden where a human conveyor belt shuffles round the lake, snapping scenic shots of Donggung Palace. History is clearly a big draw, though it was not always thus.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a child, this was a developing country and no one had time for culture,\u201d my guide Hong Chang Pyo tells me. \u201cNow we are an important industrial nation and people are more interested in learning about it.\u201d\n\nAfter a night at a resort by the shores of Bomun Lake, it\u2019s time for my next dose of serenity, this time at Golgulsa Temple, which has its roots in the 6th century and is half an hour\u2019s drive away in the hills.\n\nUnique among the temple stays, Golgulsa is home to sunmudo, a type of martial art combined with meditation, yoga and chi qong. Passed down from monk to monk over the centuries, it was first documented by abbot Seol Jeog Un, who established a training centre here in 2001.\n\nGuests on the templestay programme practise meditation . . . . . . and enjoy a vegetarian meal\n\n\u201cNow sunmudo is practised around the world,\u201d he tells a group of us during the traditional tea ceremony. \u201cPeople want to try it as part of the temple stay. They come looking for happiness and I tell them it\u2019s first about finding out who they are.\u201d\n\nMeditation and breath work can also be practised while horseback riding and doing archery, he says; both can be incorporated into a one or two-night stay, along with trekking to nearby tombs and temples and, of course, sunmudo.\n\nWe watch a performance on an open-air platform high on the hillside. It\u2019s an incredibly scenic spot, looking out over crumpled, tree-covered peaks under the watchful eye of a 9th-century Buddha carved into the limestone atop hundreds of steps zigzagging up the cliff. But when the sunmudo starts, we have eyes only for the participants. The mix of yoga and martial arts is compelling to watch, more like a ballet as it flows.\n\nGolgulsa Temple, nestled in the hills near Bomun Lake \u00a9 Lee Beomsu\n\nBedtime comes early in the temples, so I make a \u201cPrincess and the Pea\u201d affair of the three thin futons and duvets in my room before drifting off. Then it\u2019s up before dawn again for morning chanting in the temple hall, followed by sitting meditation outside in the dark, walking meditation before breakfast, and another sunmudo class.\n\nIt all leaves me feeling strangely elevated as I drive two and a half hours to the last of my trio of temple stays, high in the mountains of Songnisan national park, with its hiking trails leading to 1,000-metre peaks draped in forest. Folded into green slopes beyond ginseng fields and a 620-year-old pine tree is Beopjusa, a mountain monastery dating back to 553.\n\nThis sprawling temple with a five-storey wooden pagoda and 33-metre bronze Buddha once housed 1,000 monks; now only 40 shuffle around its precincts in long orange and white robes. I set off to scale the peak behind the monastery, and 45 minutes later am rewarded with a view of the Buddha glinting below me. There\u2019s also the chance to string a mala with 108 beads, which sounds calming until I realise that each bead can only be threaded after completing a prostration; these are beads strung with sweat.\n\nThe Beopjusa Temple complex \u00a9 Alamy\n\nIn the morning there is time to appreciate the beautiful temple grounds before the day-trippers arrive. Monk Hye Woo, who acts as general manager, gives me a tour of the various buildings, pointing out the 1,400-year-old twin-lion statue.\n\nStopping before the 33-metre Buddha statue, he explains that its standing posture, different from the more usual seated effigies, shows he is ready to lead his followers. \u201cPeople come here looking for answers,\u201d he tells me.\n\nThis peaceful spot \u2014 the name Songnisan means \u201cmountain removed from worldliness\u201d \u2014 feels like a good place to find them.\n\nDetails Jane Knight was a guest of Bamboo Travel (bambootravel.co.uk), which can tailor-make a nine-night itinerary through South Korea from \u00a33,495 per person including two temple stays on a full-board basis, other accommodation, transfers, private tours with English-speaking guides and flights from London.
