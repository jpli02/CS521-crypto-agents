        "content": "Oct 12, 2023 at 11:20 // Price\n\nCoin Idol Author\n\nThe latest price analysis by Coinidol.com report, the price of Binance Coin (BNB) continues to trade within a limited trading range.\n\nBNB price long term forecast: bearish\n\nThe limited price range is between $200 and $213. In the last 48 hours, there were rapid price fluctuations. BNB retested the October 9 low of $202 before retracing. Bulls bought the dips as the price rose to the $213 resistance level. BNB is currently moving back just a bit between the moving average lines. Buyers are protecting the current support at $200 on the downside. The extended candle tails also show active buying at lower price levels.\n\nBNB indicator display\n\nBNB price bars have consistently closed below moving average lines. BNB prices have remained steady as selling pressure has reached bearish exhaustion. Moreover, the market is oversold as the probability of selling pressure is low. The 50-day line SMA and the 21-day line SMA serve as price bar resistance lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nKey resistance levels \u2013 $300, $350, $400\n\nKey support levels \u2013 $200, $150, $100\n\nWhat is the next direction for BNB/USD?\n\nThe Binance coin at the bottom of the chart has remained within its range. The price range has not changed as doji candlesticks are present. The altcoin's range will remain unchanged. However, if buyers are attracted by cheaper prices, the price may increase. This will drive the price of the altcoin up.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we reported on October 6, Binance coin recovered and crossed the moving average lines on September 28. The high of $221.60 marked the end of the uptrend.\n\nDisclaimer.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe crypto verse experiences another negative trading day as the market loses momentum. Bitcoin price continues to trade below $27K, with Ethereum price below $1600, indicating the top coins to trade under a bearish influence.\n\nCZ\u2019s BNB price experiences the same faith as the coin is currently hovering close to its crucial support level. The Binance coin has been trading in a descending channel pattern since the start of October. Binance coin price has displayed massive price volatility since September. The BNB price has been constantly trading between $207 and $222.\n\nFurther, the coin recently broke down the support zone at $207, indicating a bear power in the market. The coin traded in a consolidated range of $207 as its resistance and $204 as its support level.\n\nAfter trading within the range for about two days, the BNB coin recently lost momentum and attempted to break down the trend. However, the bulls are fighting hard to hold the price above the level as this level is essential for the coin.\n\nThe MACD has displayed an adverse price action since the start of the month, indicating a weak buying and selling power in the market. Further, the averages show a bearish convergence in the charts, suggesting the possibility of the BNB coin price losing value before attempting a rebound.\n\nIf the market experiences a trend reversal and the bulls come into power, the BNB price will gain momentum and retest its resistance zone at $207. Further, if the coin gains a bullish momentum, the price will continue to rise and test its upper resistance at $211.5 in the coming days.\n\nOn the contrary, if the bears continue dominating the market and the price continues to trade in the descending channel, the BNB coin price is set to record new yearly lows. Moreover, if the coin fails to hold its crucial support level of $204, then the Binance price is bound to test its lower level of $196 soon."

        "title": "Flash Loan Attack on BNB Chain Nets $1.57M in Record-Breaking Profit - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The most significant flash loan attack in the BNB Chain was reported on Oct. 11 when an MEV bot made a massive arbitrage profit of $1.575 million.\n\nThe attack, which passed through the Pancakeswap DEX network, only cost the perpetrating bot a fee of $4.16, leaving them with humongous profits.\n\nLarge Single Flash Loan Attack on BNB Chain\n\nAs per reports, the MEV Bot with address 0x216Ccf on the BNB Chain emerged as the record holder of the most significant single arbitrage profit in the chain\u2019s history.\n\nEigenPhi, a leading blockchain data analysis firm, revealed the details, confirming that the enormous profit resulted from a well-planned price manipulation attack on the BH token.\n\nEssentially, the attacker exploited a shortcoming in the system for about $1.27 million, immediately transferring the funds to the popular mixer Tornado Cash.\n\nThis attacker borrowed a large amount of USDT using the function ID 0x33688938 and added USDT to the contract.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the liquidity ratios for the contract are around 1 USDT:100 BH. The attacker then manipulated the system by instantly swapping USDT for BH via pair and later removed the liquidity with the transaction ID 0x4e290832.\n\nThis swap affected the ratio of liquidity removal drastically, changing to approximately 1 USDT:2 BH, allowing them to withdraw even more USDT.\n\nThe series of transactions was later confirmed by Beosin, a renowned blockchain security company, emphasizing its deliberate nature. The attacker profited a total of $1.575 million in the entire process.\n\n$BH token on BNB Chain was exploited for ~$1.27M due to suspected price manipulation. The profits were sent into Tornado Cash.\n\nAttacker: 0xFDbfcEEa1de360364084a6F37C9cdb7AaeA63464 The attacker flashloaned a large amount of $USDT, then called 0x33688938() to add $USDT to the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/POppQswi7u \u2014 Beosin Alert (@BeosinAlert) October 11, 2023\n\nThe MEV Bot address 0x216Ccf was possibly created on Oct. 6 and has been inactive since then, up to the date of the flash loan attack. The counter address, 0xFDbfcE, has been active and currently holds about 1,000 BNB tokens valued at $205.8K.\n\nThe Flash Loan Attack Conundrum\n\nFlash loan attackers will mainly exploit the flash loan mechanism to steal users\u2019 funds, as in the case of BH tokens. In its bare meaning, a flash loan is not an attack but a system allowing people to benefit from arbitrage trading.\n\nIn the 24 hours preceding the writing of this report, EigenPhi\u2018s data suggests that there were about 278 flash loans within the Ethereum network. The number has been 2,435 and 9,721 in the past 7 and 30 days, respectively. Over $2.2 billion in transaction value has been flash loans in the past 30 days, suggesting the extended use of this mechanism.\n\nHowever, many scammers have been leveraging flash loans to cripple cryptosystems and steal from investors, as in the case mentioned above. In June this year, a DeFi protocol dubbed Sturdy Finance lost 442 ETH worth $800K through different hacks, including a flash loan attack."

        "content": "The popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced Neutron as the next project featured on their Binance Launchpool staking platform.\n\nUntil October 30, you can earn Neutron (NTRN) tokens on Binance simply by staking your BNB or the TUSD and FDUSD stablecoins. You can withdraw the coins you\u2019ve staked at any time and keep the NTRN rewards.\n\nYou can earn NTRN on Binance Launchpool between October 11 and October 30. The amount of token rewards you earn will depend on how many coins you stake.\n\nEarn NTRN Tokens on Binance\n\nBinance plans to distribute 2% of the total NTRN token supply to users on Launchpool. This translates to 20 million NTRN tokens out of a total supply of 1 billion tokens.\n\n16 million NTRN will be distributed to BNB stakers, while the TUSD and FDUSD staking pools will have 2 million NTRN tokens each. However, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you will earn more NTRN tokens if you stake BNB rather than the stablecoins. It all depends on how big the size of your stake is relative to the size of the entire staking pool.\n\nIn addition to featuring the Neutron project on its Launchpool platform, Binance has also listed the NTRN token for trading on the Binance exchange. The token is now available in trading pairs against BTC, USDT and BNB.\n\nNotably, Binance has listed NTRN with the \u201cSeed Tag\u201d, which is used to label crypto projects that are still very early in their development. Cryptocurrencies with this tag were previously known in the \u201cInnovation Zone\u201d. The purpose of the Seed Tag is to let users know that the cryptocurrency might be more volatile and risky compared to most other cryptos listed on the exchange.\n\nWhat is Neutron (NTRN)?\n\nIf you want to earn Neutron tokens, the first thing you\u2019ll need is a Binance account.\n\nCreate Binance Account\n\nNeutron is a crypto project that\u2019s building in the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. The project is creating a smart contract platform that derives its security from the Cosmos Hub, which is the main chain in the Cosmos network of blockchains.\n\nNotably, Neutron is the first blockchain on Cosmos that\u2019s secured through the Interchain Security feature. This means that it will benefit from the security provided by Cosmos Hub validators.\n\nThe Neutron platform will make it possible for developers to create decentralized applications that can be deployed on any blockchain that supports the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol without needing to customize their application for each blockchain they want to deploy it on.\n\nNTRN is the native token of the Neutron blockchain, and serves a number of different roles. It is used for paying transaction fees, governance and can also be used in DeFi applications as either a liquidity, collateral or reward token.\n\nNeutron has received backing from several notable venture capital investors, including the likes of Binance Labs, CoinFund and Delphi Ventures.\n\nHow to earn NTRN tokens on Binance?\n\nPlease keep in mind that only users who complete an identity verification process with Binance are eligible to participate in CyberConnect token farming on Binance Launchpool.\n\nOnce your account is ready, you\u2019ll need some BNB, TUSD or FDUSD tokens to stake. If you already own these tokens, you can deposit some to your Binance account. Otherwise, Binance offers plenty of ways of buying these tokens with either crypto or fiat.\n\nAfter your account is verified and loaded up with some BNB, TUSD, and/or FDUSD, head over to the menu on the top side of the Binance interface and select \"Earn\". Then, go to \"Launchpad\".\n\nThen, scroll down to the \"Launchpool\" section, and you\u2019ll be able to find the available NTRN farming pools. Depending on which tokens you want to stake, select the TUSD Pool, FDUSD Pool, or BNB Pool. Then, follow the instructions provided by the exchange."
