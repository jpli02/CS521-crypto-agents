        "content": "The hard fork is forecasted to occur on 19th July 2023. at 6:00 UTC. A hard fork refers to a permanent change in the way a network operates by way of a software upgrade. No new BNB tokens will be issued for this upgrade, and two-thirds of all BNB Chain validators will need to upgrade their nodes to process blocks following the upgrade."

This update, expected to occur at block height 328,088,888, will require all full node operators to shift to software version v0.10.16.\n\nThe upcoming changes include the introduction of BEP-255, a feature that aims to boost security on the BNB Beacon Chain through on-chain asset reconciliation. This mechanism allows for the tracking of user balance changes in each block, ensuring the detection and rectification of any inconsistencies. In the event of reconciliation errors, the blockchain is designed to halt the production of new blocks, thereby mitigating potential security threats.\n\nIn addition to the new feature, the hard fork upgrade will address a security vulnerability known as the \u2018Rogue Key Attack.\u2019 This bug, which could potentially compromise the network\u2019s \u201cFast Finality\u201d mechanism, will be rectified through the clearing of all existing vote addresses once the hard fork is activated. Post-upgrade, validators will be required to add their vote addresses once again to ensure the continued proper functioning and integrity of the BNB Beacon Chain."
