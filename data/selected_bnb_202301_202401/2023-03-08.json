        "content": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFTS) \u2013 A home in Florida has a coffin in the bathroom, a Ouija board on the wall, and creepy clowns watching you sleep.\n\nThe spooky setup at The Phantom History House, a new bed-and-breakfast in Hillsborough County, may sound like a nightmare for some and a fun adventure for others.\n\nThe owners, Steve Blanchard and Tim Hinton, said the look of the place they were going for is modern Victorian with \u201ca little bit of gothic sprinkled in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always say we\u2019re creepy yet comfortable, eerie but elegant,\u201d Blanchard said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re going for.\u201d\n\nThe idea came about on Blanchard\u2019s podcast about paranormal history. He said he\u2019s always loved anything gothic and Halloween related.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really into the paranormal thing, but I love Disney and storytelling,\u201d Hinton said.\n\nTogether, the couple turned a beautiful home into a high-end haunted mansion with rooms starting at $175 a night. Brave guests can choose one of four themed sleeping chambers.\n\nThe four main rooms include the cemetery room, the portrait room, the Ouija board room, and the castle room, which is complete with rows of remote-controlled candles.\n\nThe bathrooms are also themed, so guests can rest and bathe in peace.\n\nThe pair also have mediums and tarot card readers to entertain guests. They said they love to share ghost stories from the people who visit.\n\n\u201cIf you want to tell us about your ghost story when you were a little kid, we would love to hear it,\u201d Hinton said.\n\nBooking information is available online.\n\nCopyright 2023 WFTS via CNN Newsource.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe mainnet of SatoshiChain, the blockchain technology that connects Bitcoin to DeFi, will formally launch on June 1st, 2023. As it enables users to fully take advantage of the features and advantages of the blockchain, including decentralized applications and smart contracts, the launch represents a significant milestone for SatoshiChain and its community.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to announce the official launch date of the SatoshiChain Mainnet,\u201d said Christopher Kuntz, a co-founder of SatoshiChain. \u201cOur team has been working tirelessly on this project for quite some time, intent on bridging the gap between bitcoin and EVM chains in a way that is not only fast and secure but also user-friendly and developer-friendly at the same time.\u201d\n\nWith bridged BTC serving as the base layer token for all transactions, gas fees, and smart contracts, SatoshiChain enables quick, secure, and inexpensive transactions while supporting a variety of use cases, such as DeFi, gaming, supply chain management, and more. Users can easily switch from Ethereum-based decentralized applications to the SatoshiChain platform thanks to the Mainnet\u2019s full compatibility with EVM-compatible blockchains. In addition, the platform offers users a variety of tools for creating and deploying their decentralized applications.\n\nTo encourage early adopters and Testnet participants, SatoshiChain is launching the Incentivized Testnet prior to the Mainnet launch and airdropping SatoshiChain Governance tokens ($SC). The airdrop is a way to thank the community for its support and involvement in the chain\u2019s development and testing. Users who completed various tasks as part of the airdrop process before the Mainnet launch will be eligible to receive $SC tokens. The SatoshiChain website and social media channels contain the Incentivized Testnet and airdrop information.\n\nThe dedication of SatoshiChain to building a decentralized future is demonstrated by its efforts to offer a trustworthy and effective blockchain platform that is open to all users with the aim of multi-chain interoperability. SatoshiChain is moving closer to achieving this objective with the initial Mainnet launch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSatoshiChain\n\nWith bridged bitcoin serving as the base layer token, SatoshiChain is a blockchain platform that supports decentralized applications and smart contracts while facilitating quick, safe, and inexpensive transactions. The platform makes it simple for users to move their decentralized applications from other platforms because it is fully compatible with EVM-compatible blockchains.
