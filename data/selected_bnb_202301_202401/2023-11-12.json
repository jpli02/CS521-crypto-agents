        "content": "Advertisement\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market valuation, has experienced a meteoric rise, surging by just over 10% in the past week. The cryptocurrency\u2019s volume has also seen a significant uptick, increasing by approximately 62% to $283 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nWhile Shiba Inu initially gained popularity as a speculative asset, it has evolved into a fully-fledged ecosystem with a growing range of utilities, drawing in investors from all corners of the crypto market.\n\nThe recent surge in Shiba Inu\u2019s value can be attributed to various developments within the ecosystem, with the most significant being the unveiling of the \u201cBig Plan from the Shiba State 2024/2025\u201d by Lucie, Shiba Inu\u2019s marketing specialist.\n\nEarlier last week, Lucie took to the X platform to reveal the ambitious strategy. Outlining the initiative\u2019s aims, key among them being giving \u201cmore power to everyone.\u201d According to the pundit, this would decentralize the governance of Shibarium, putting more decision-making power in the hands of the community and reducing reliance on central control.\n\nAnother key point of the plan was preventing the dominance of a few entities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBy involving all tokens in voting, we avoid the risk of a few dominating the decisions, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.\u201d She wrote.\n\nLucie also emphasized encouraging active participation within the Shiba Inu community. She disclosed that high-voting power tokens may incentivize engagement and collaboration.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is the focus on sustainable growth. She emphasized that by embracing decentralization and community empowerment, Shiba Inu aims to pave the way for long-term, sustainable growth through collective decision-making and active participation.\n\nLucie\u2019s message aligns with Shiba Inu\u2019s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, who expressed a desire to unite pro-Shiba Inu influencers and their efforts. In a tweet on November 4, Kusama emphasized community involvement and collaboration, underscoring that Shiba Inu intends to operate as a decentralized and inclusive ecosystem.\n\nMeanwhile, these developments coincide with the recent launch of \u201cThe Shib Magazine,\u201d released on November 7. This publication, which experienced a brief hiatus, is now back with insightful articles, news, and the exciting news of 1,000 free NFTs of the first edition cover for readers.\n\nThe Shiba Inu team also introduced the Shib Wallet, designed to enhance the crypto experience for its users. As per a blog, the wallet will have a unique feature that allows users to recover it even if they forget their seed phrase, ensuring secure and user-friendly crypto management.\n\nThat said, as Shiba Inu continues to make strides in its ecosystem development and community involvement, the future looks promising for Shiba Inu\u2019s ecosystem, positioning SHIB for explosive growth.\n\nAt press time, SHIB was trading at $0.0000089 after a 2.35% drop in the past 24 hours."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe crypto debit card market in Europe is witnessing a changing of the guard as Binance closes its service and Bybit expands its own. In late October, Binance announced its Visa debit card will be wound up by the end of December. Around the same time, Bybit unveiled a new promotion to entice European citizens to sign up for its Mastercard.\n\nBybit Unveils Trio of Bonuses for New Users\n\nBybit only introduced its card in March for European residents, but the debit Mastercard has already proven popular. It\u2019s likely to attract plenty of new customers now that Binance is exiting the region in terms of debit card provision, with the appeal of the Bybit Card bolstered by a trifecta of signup bonuses. There\u2019s a 10EUR bonus for new users who apply for a Bybit Card plus another 5EUR for making the first transaction with the Mastercard. Holders who also make a first deposit to Bybit will be eligible for another 10EUR bonus.\n\n\u201cThe Bybit Card represents our commitment to fostering widespread cryptocurrency adoption in the real world,\u201d said Bybit CEO Ben Zhou. \u201cWe firmly believe that cryptocurrencies should serve as more than mere digital assets; they should be a convenient and tangible method of payment for individuals in their day-to-day transactions.\u201d\n\nThe card allows users to convert cryptos such as BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC and XRP to fiat. Whenever purchases are made using the card, loyalty points are accrued. These can be redeemed for unique offers and exclusive rewards with Bybit partners. The crypto company is expanding its list of partners, increasing the card\u2019s utility in the process.\n\nCrypto Debit Cards in the Digital Age\n\nToday\u2019s millennial and Gen X and Z consumers are digital natives, raised with the internet and accustomed to spreading their wealth across different markets and platforms. This typically includes exposure to stocks and cryptocurrency and use of neo banks that provide access to digital assets as well as providing traditional banking services. These services have been complemented by the emergence of crypto debit cards that allow cryptocurrency to be converted to fiat and spent in store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree years ago, Binance introduced its own branded Visa card in Europe and began onboarding customers, many of whom were existing users of its exchange. While those customers can still use Binance for their trading needs, they\u2019ll need to find a new crypto debit card provider. Binance\u2019s decision to shutter its service in the EU comes at a time when tighter legislation is being introduced that will oblige crypto businesses to incur a higher compliance burden to accord with the law.\n\nAlthough debit cards are often described as making crypto spendable, allowing it to be exchanged for physical goods and services, the crypto is technically converted to fiat first. This means that the merchant takes receipt of fiat currency, saving them from exposure to digital asset volatility. From the customer\u2019s perspective, however, the process is seamless, effectively allowing crypto to be spent like regular money.\n\nA Convenient Way to Cash Out\n\nWhile many users rely on crypto debit cards as a way to shop and spend digital assets on goods and services, that\u2019s not their only function. They also provide a convenient way to cash out, allowing users to move funds from the cryptosphere back onto fiat rails. Cash can then be withdrawn using an ATM or held in a virtual account before being reinvested in crypto when market conditions are favourable.\n\nMost crypto debit cards carry limits on the amount of cryptocurrency that can be cashed out in this manner. For this reason, high-value withdrawals, generally over $10K, are best made by bank wire. Nevertheless, most crypto traders are investing smaller amounts. For them, crypto debit cards are a useful way of entering and exiting the market while retaining the ability to spend money in the physical world and online without waiting days for funds to clear."
