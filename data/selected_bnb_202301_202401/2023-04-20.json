        "content": "Advertisement\n\nHotbit Exchange, a global crypto trading platform, will officially list ODOGE (Optimism Doge) on April 20th, 2023, and the ODOGE/nUSD trading pair will be available for trading for all users of Hotbit Exchange.\n\nOptimism Doge (ODOGE) is a popular meme coin named after an optimistic and cheerful dog representing hope and positivity. A community-driven meme coin with unlimited potential.The native token ODOGE will be listed on Hotbit Exchange on April 20th, 2023, at 12:00 AM UTC.\n\nINTRODUCING OPTIMISM DOGE\n\nODOGE is a well-established meme coin that operates on blockchain technology and draws its name from a cheerful and optimistic dog that symbolizes hope, positivity, and confidence in the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency. The coin\u2019s mission is to create a strong and vibrant community and a comprehensive ecosystem that provides users with an all-encompassing and user-friendly experience.\n\nODOGE has many features, including ODoge NFTs, Game, swap, DEFI, farm, ODoge Chain, and Cross-chain Bridges, allowing users to engage with the coin in various ways. The team behind ODOGE is committed to continually developing and expanding the platform to provide users with new and exciting opportunities to interact with the coin.\n\nIn the short run, ODOGE\u2019s primary objectives are centered around building a robust and engaged community, securing listings on reputable exchanges, and carrying out innovative burning experiments. The team aims to continually enhance the ecosystem and application facilities, leveraging cross-chain functionality and expanding the coin\u2019s use cases to attract more investors to the community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the long run, ODOGE\u2019s goal is to become a leading meme coin, following in the footsteps of Doge and Shib, ultimately achieving a listing on Binance. To achieve these objectives, the team will employ marketing principles and execute strategic initiatives to position ODOGE as a prominent and respected player within the crypto community.\n\nAbout ODOGE Token\n\nOptimism Doge, the popular meme coin, has a total supply of 42 trillion tokens, out of which 90% have already been burned, leaving 4.2 trillion tokens in circulation. The token distribution is allocated as follows: 5.3% for presale, 2.7% for liquidity pools, 0.3% for marketing, 0.3% for charity, 0.4% for development and community building, and 1% for exchange listing.\n\nOptimism Doge has implemented a transaction burn feature to ensure a deflationary model, where a portion of each transaction is destroyed, leading to a decrease in circulating supply over time. This scarcity effect may potentially increase the token\u2019s value. Furthermore, the coin imposes a 10% transaction tax on every trade, with 5% of the tax distributed as dividends to all token holders, rewarding all investors.\n\nIn addition, 3% of the transaction tax will be allocated towards buyback and burn, community development, and exchange listing. The remaining 2% will be dedicated to marketing and ecosystem development. This ensures that the community continues to develop and grow, emphasising fostering a thriving ecosystem.\n\nABOUT HOTBIT\n\nFounded in 2018 and holding an Estonian MTR license, American MSB license, Australian AUSTRAC license, and Canadian MSB license, Hotbit cryptocurrency exchange is known as a leading trading platform that continues to develop and integrate various forms of businesses such as spot trading, financial derivatives, cryptocurrency investment and DAPP into one platform.
