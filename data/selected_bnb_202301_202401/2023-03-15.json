        "content": "Leading decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap has officially launched on BNB Chain, the blockchain network closely linked to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance.\n\nAnnouncing the move via a Twitter post on Wednesday, the DEX platform said the deployment will offer faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum Mainnet and make Uniswap more accessible to a larger audience.\n\n55M UNI Token Holders Voted in Favor\n\nThe leading DEX expanded to the BNB Chain after a successful governance vote from the Uniswap community that was concluded on February 10. More than 66% of voters representing 55 million UNI token holders supported the deployment after Plasma Finance\u2019s CEO, Ilia Maksimenka, released a proposal for the deployment last year.\n\nBefore that, the token bridge protocol Wormhole was chosen as Uniswap\u2019s designated bridge to the BNB Chain in a preliminary vote.\n\nPossible Benefits of the Deployment\n\nFollowing his proposal, Maksimenka stressed that Uniswap launching on BNB Chain could offer a variety of benefits, such as expanding the DEX\u2019s reach and \u201cpotentially drive further growth and adoption\u201d of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nUniswap\u2019s current total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $3.4 billion, according to DeFiLlama. Maksimenka said he believes the deployment could add another $1 billion to the platform\u2019s TVL. The Plasma CEO also stated that deployment would also increase Uniswap\u2019s user base, with one to two million new users joining the exchange.\n\nWith the deployment now officially completed, Uniswap users can now make use of the advantages the BNB Chain has to offer.\n\nCommenting on the development, Alvin Kan, director of growth at BNB Chain, said:\n\n\u201cWith BNB Chain\u2019s thriving and dedicated community, scalability, and accessibility, it is a launchpad for all things web3, where protocols looking to reach larger audiences can grow.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Uniswaps native token, UNI, failed to impress on the news. The token fell by nearly 10% shortly after the announcement and was trading at $5.83 at the time of filing this report."

        "title": "Mortgage misery: Belgian home loans hit record lows - The Brussels Times",
        "content": "Credit: Belga / Kurt Desplenter\n\nMortgage loans in Belgium have hit record lows as rising interest rates and soaring inflation have made house purchases increasingly unaffordable for the vast majority of Belgians, l'Echo and De Tijd report.\n\nAccording to figures recently published by the National Bank of Belgium (BNB), 16,165 new mortgages were issued in Belgium last month: the lowest number since the BNB began collecting data in 2007.\n\nThe study also found that 32,600 mortgages were granted over the first two months of this year: less than half the number issued over the same period in 2022. Mortgage applications were also down: excluding refinancings, applications fell 20-40% relative to the long-term average.\n\n\"The higher interest rates weigh on people's borrowing capacity,\" said John Romain of Immotheker Finotheker, a mortgage advisory firm. \"In combination with an uncertain economic climate, this leads to a standstill in demand, while the price rearrangement of supply is yet to come.\"\n\nWidespread pessimism\n\nThe BNB study follows a related survey, which found that Belgians are becoming increasingly pessimistic about the prospect of one day owning their own home.\n\nThe study, which was reported on by La Derni\u00e8re Heure, found that 65.1% of Belgian non-homeowners believe that they will never be able to afford a house, up from 63.7% last year. It also noted that more than seven in ten Belgians (71.3%) believe that purchasing a home is inconceivable without financial help from their parents or other family members.\n\nUnfortunately, such economic pessimism appears to be growing entrenched in Belgian society. According to the latest annual edition of the Testachats Index, which measures Belgians' consumption and saving habits, in 2022 more than half of all Belgians (53.3%) reported having some financial difficulties \u2014 a 4.3 percentage point increase compared to 2021.\n\nRelated News\n\nThe study also found that almost two-thirds (65.7%) of Belgians claimed they are unable to save any money at all at the end of each month (up from 58% in 2021). Just 14.3% stated that they are able to save money without too much difficulty (down from 21.7% in 2021).\n\nTestachats further noted that Belgians do not expect their financial predicament to improve over the coming months: \"50.2% of our sample fear a deterioration in their situation in the coming months, 41.6% think it will be the same and only 8.2% that it will be better,\" Sebastian Stevering, a project manager at Testachats, told Le Soir."

        "content": "Buoyant sentiments continued to prevail in the crypto market as Bitcoin and other tokens extended their gains for the straight third day. However, the gains were capped and some tokens saw some profit booking during the early trading hours in Asia.\n\nTraders expect that the worst is over for the digital token market after the global fallout triggered by the American banking sector. Coupled with this, the US inflation numbers were in-line with the expectation, hinting that aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed are likely to be scrapped.\n\nBitcoin briefly topped the $26,000 market before giving up some gains. The largest crypto token was last seen below $25,000 level. Its largest peer Ethereum also attempted to top $1,800 but was barely holding the $1,700 mark at the time of writing this report. Altcoins outperformed the blue-chip tokens a few rose up to 35 per cent.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest crypto asset surged by over 12 per cent in the last one week. The UK government bailing out the Silicon Valley Bank has created a positive sentiment within the investment community and which may have increased buying activity, said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin.\n\n\n\n\"As per the latest data, US consumer inflation has slowed down but it's still on the higher side which may drive the Fed to continue its hawkish stance. If the macroeconomic factors continue to remain favorable then we may see Bitcoin testing $30,000 level very soon,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged stablecoins and Tron, all other popular crypto tokens extended their gains on Wednesday. Avalanche surged about 6 per cent, whereas Litecoin gained 5 per cent. Dogecoin, Solana and Polkadot were up 4 per cent, each.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher at $1.10 trillion, after rising more than 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 13 per cent close to $102.40 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin reached its highest point in nine months by surging above the $26,000 level. This was due to some encouraging inflation data and the banking sector's continued recovery from a near-catastrophic situation, said Edul Patel, CEO and Co-Founder of Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Although Bitcoin later gave up some of its gains, it remains up by 81 per cent from its lowest cycle. Ethereum has also been experiencing an upward trend, surpassing a crucial resistance level of $1,700. The current positive developments in the market indicate an overall bullish sentiment,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View By Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nOn the back of US CPI numbers pinning inflation at expected 6 per cent, Bitcoin (BTC) broke through the $26,000 level and was up by about a strong 30 per cent in the last 2 days. This is BTC\u2019s highest since June 2022. The fact that BTC has only one strong near-term resistance in its golden pocket at $25,959 should further give merit to its bullishness\n\nBut it has shed its gains and is trading below $25,000 again. Thus, despite a continuation of a bullish market structure with higher highs and higher lows, its bullish scenario of targeting the next resistance at $28,790 should be on pause for now.\n\nBTC\u2019s 50-day and 200-day moving averages (at $22,944 and $19,716, respectively,) coupled with its RSI of around 80 indicate that it might be overbought. BTC might end up falling down to its next support at $23,965 before its next attempt at a higher move.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels\n\nResistance: $25,960, $26,670, $28,800\n\nSupport: $23,965, $21,970, $19,500\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.
