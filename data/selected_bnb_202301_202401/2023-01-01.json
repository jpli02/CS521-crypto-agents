This decision reflects the casino\u2019s commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancement and providing its players with the most diverse and convenient options for making transactions in the casino.\n\nWhat is Binance Coin (BNB)?\n\nBefore discussing the significance of CryptoGames accepting BNB as a payment option, it is important to understand what BNB is and how it is used. BNB is the abbreviation for Binance Coin, which is a cryptocurrency developed by the Binance exchange team. It was created to be used on the Binance platform as a means of paying fees for transactions, such as trading fees, listing fees, and withdrawal fees. BNB is the native token of Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is a blockchain used to power the development of various platforms such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that allow users to interact with a variety of financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading.\n\nIn addition to being used on the Binance exchange, BNB is also accepted by a growing number of merchants and can be bought and sold on a number of cryptocurrency exchanges. As of now, BNB is one of the top ten currencies based on market capitalization.\n\nAbout CryptoGames\n\nCryptoGames is a pioneering online cryptocurrency gambling platform that was launched in early 2020.

        "title": "Top 5 altcoins to watch in 2023 - Crypto expert's list - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Alternative coins (altcoins) have remained suppressed for several months, a situation complicated by the extended cryptocurrency bear market. Indeed, in the past, altcoins rallied thanks to interest from retail investors, but they have failed to pick up as the crypto market was hit with instances such as the FTX exchange collapse and soaring inflation.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrency investors hope 2023 will come with positive tidings and put behind the 2022 sell-off. In this line, in a YouTube video on January 1, crypto trading expert Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe identified specific altcoins to look out for in 2023. Below are the altcoins identified by the analyst:\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nAccording to Poppe, Chainlink (LINK) is currently in an accumulation zone like the general market. He noted that the token is likely to bottom in the range of about $4 to $5 and will benefit from a possible relief rally once the Federal Reserve slows down on its monetary policy.\n\nIn the meantime, he noted that the token is exhibiting a historical cycle similar to the one recorded in 2019.\n\nWith the analyst projecting further correction for LINK, he suggested that the token could interest investors focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi). He said that 2023 will likely form the best moment to accumulate LINK, stating that the asset will likely take off in 2024 or 2025.\n\nBy press time, LINK was trading at $5.60, with a correction of about 0.4% in the last 24 hours. At the current price level, Poppe stated that LINK is facing resistance at around $7.80, and breaching the level could lead to a further continuation with a focus on $16.85.\n\nChainlink one-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nOn technical analysis, LINK\u2019s summary of the one-day daily gauges from TradingView recommends \u2018sell\u2019 at 14 while moving averages are going for a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 13. For oscillators, the gauges are \u2018neutral\u2019 at 8.\n\nChainlink technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nPoppe pointed out that the interoperability blockchain token is being hammered by the crypto price movement, stating that it\u2019s getting stretched irrationally. Besides the prevailing bear market, the analyst noted that DOT is being affected by the lawsuit against the Gemini crypto exchange, considering the relationship between the two entities.\n\nWhile projecting a relief rally later in 2023, Poppe projected that DOT could rally between $16 to $24. By the time of publishing, DOT was trading at $4.35, recording daily gains of about 0.37% within the last 24 hours.\n\nPolkadot one-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nElsewhere, DOT\u2019s technical analysis summary is for the \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at 13, while moving averages are for a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 13.\n\nPolkadot technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nCosmos (ATOM)\n\nSimilarly, for Cosmos (ATOM), Poppe stated that the price movement could replicate the 2019 and 2020 trading patterns where the asset consolidated before rallying again. He suggested that at the current price, ATOM offers an opportunity for investors to accumulate while projecting that the asset is likely to gain to a region above $25 in the event of a relief rally.\n\nHowever, he expressed scepticism if the current price movement could lead to a bottom. At the moment, ATOM is trading at $9.45 with minor gains of 0.65% in the last 24 hours.\n\nCosmos one-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAs ATOM consolidates, the token\u2019s summary of daily technical analysis on TradingView is for \u2018sell\u2019 at 10, similar to moving averages at 8. The token\u2019s oscillators are recommending a \u2018neutral\u2019 sentiment at 8.\n\nCosmos technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nAdditionally, Poppe stated that Binance Coin (BNB) should form part of any portfolio because it is provided by the largest crypto exchange Binance. In this line, the analyst believes that BNB can benefit if the general crypto market rallies again. However, he cautioned BNB prospects largely depend on how Bitcoin (BTC) performs.\n\nAt the same time, as reported by Finbold, crypto experts at TradingShot through TradingView projected that BNB could be among the best investments in 2023.\n\nBNB is still consolidating, trading at $245 with a correction of about 0.5 % in the last 24 hours.\n\nBNB one-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nFurthermore, BNB technical analysis summary on a daily basis is going for the \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at 15 while moving averages are for \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 14. On the other hand, the oscillator gauges are for neutrality at 9.\n\nBNB technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nSkale (SKL)\n\nFinally, the trading expert noted that interoperable, multichain network Skale (SKL) has the potential to rally, citing the platform\u2019s strong foundation. He suggested that if SKL breaks the $0.025 resistance, it will take the previous highs and start rallying to the zone of $0.20. Currently, SKL is trading at $0.02.\n\nSkale one-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nDespite the analyst identifying SKL\u2019s foundation as a critical trigger for the rally, the token\u2019s technical analysis summary on TradingView aligns with \u2018sell\u2019 at 16. Moving averages are for a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 14, while oscillators are for \u2018buy\u2019 at 4.\n\nSkale technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn conclusion, the highlighted altcoins movement will largely be determined by how the general crypto market reacts to prevailing factors like macroeconomic elements such as rising inflation. Furthermore, the market is still feeling the effects of the FTX crypto exchange implosion, and how the matter is concluded will be key.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
