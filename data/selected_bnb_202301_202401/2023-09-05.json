Some state-owned assets were not performing at their optimum and had become drains on the public purse. Others capable of generating significant and valuable foreign currency were then sold to foreign buyers.\n\nIn 2003, the government offered its controlling interest or 57 percent of the shares it owned in the Barbados National Bank (BNB) to the Trinidad-based Republic Bank group. In 2012, Republic Bank would acquire the remaining shares, giving it 100 percent control of the financial institution that many people to this day are convinced was a wrong move.\n\nThe sale of BNB brought more than US$80 million into the treasury. During the period, the government also took the opportunity to dispose of most of its interest in some profitable entities.\n\nThe Barbados government decided it was time to sell lucrative assets such as its shares in Barbados Light & Power and the Insurance Corporation of Barbados. Over the years, we have also seen the Arawak Cement Plant being sold to foreign interests as well as state interest in Cable & Wireless.\n\nBarbados\u2019 need to tidy up its finances and block the bleed of state finances is upon us again. Among those assets on the chopping block include the troublesome Barbados Agricultural Management Company (BAMC) which manages sugar industry assets for the government.\n\nThe sugar industry is a troublesome and complex animal. There is a widely held belief among Barbadians that the sugarcane/sugar industry has already seen its best days and the premium value of the sector has already been extracted by the class of privileged Barbadians who had a long head start on the majority of the population.\n\nThus, the announcement by head of the Barbados Sustainable Energy Cooperative Society Ltd (CoopEnergy) retired Colonel Trevor Browne that this cooperative was seeking to invest $100 million in the takeover of BAMC in furtherance of its green energy thrust, came as a surprise.\n\nGenerally speaking, the thought of average working-class Barbadians investing and holding ownership of the assets of BAMC is intriguing.\n\nSome have even compared it to the opportunity offered by the Government for credit unions to purchase the shares it was prepared to sell in BNB.\n\nHowever, the BAMC is not BNB; the two entities are fish and fowl.\n\nAs much as we welcome the enthusiasm of Colonel Browne and his supporters in CoopEnergy, we must remind them that $100 million is not $100. The credit union movement comprises mostly citizens from the lower economic rung who have put aside their precious savings.\n\nYes, they deserve to be invested and own a greater stake in the assets of this country, but they also need the greatest level of protection because they have so much more to lose.\n\nThe impression should not be given that this $100 million investment has been approved by the more than 200 000 credit union members across the nearly 30 credit unions on the island. We, therefore, urge caution and a tempering of the mad rush to make deals happen.\n\nWe are forced to agree with longstanding credit unionist and former president of the Barbados Cooperative & Credit Union League Mr Ashton Turney.\n\n\u201cInvestment of money from any source should be undertaken after relevant analysis and particularly cost-benefit analysis.

        "title": "The End of Airbnb in New York - WIRED",
        "content": "Thousands of Airbnbs and short-term rentals are about to be wiped off the map in New York City.\n\nLocal Law 18, which came into force Tuesday, is so strict it doesn\u2019t just limit how Airbnb operates in the city\u2014it almost bans it entirely for many guests and hosts. From now on, all short-term rental hosts in New York must register with the city, and only those who live in the place they\u2019re renting\u2014and are present when someone is staying\u2014can qualify. And people can only have two guests.\n\nGone are the days of sleek downtown apartments outfitted for bachelorette parties, cozy two- and three-bedroom apartments near museums for families, and even the option for people to rent out their apartment on weekends when they\u2019re away. While Airbnb, Vrbo, and others can continue to operate in New York, the new rules are so tight that Airbnb sees it as a \u201cde facto ban\u201d on its business.\n\nShort-term rentals can bring noise, trash, and danger, and they can price local residents out of their own neighborhoods. Some landlords in New York are prolific and have hundreds of Airbnb listings. But other New Yorkers who have listings on Airbnb are trying to make ends meet, either leasing their place while they\u2019re out of town or renting half of a duplex to help cover their mortgage costs.\n\nAirbnb is also popular with some of the 66 million visitors a year looking for accommodations that are cheaper and sometimes larger than hotels. In 2022 alone, short-term rental listings made $85 million in New York. The city might be a relatively small slice of Airbnb\u2019s global market, but the new rules show how local governments can effectively stamp out short-term rentals overnight and lessen their impact on dense residential areas. And New York is just one of many cities around the world trying to calm the short-term rental gold-rush.\n\nAnd everyone is taking a different approach. Dallas has limited short-term rentals to specific neighborhoods to avoid disruptive and dangerous parties. Elsewhere, the Canadian province of Quebec and Memphis, Tennessee, among others, now require licenses for short-term rentals. In San Francisco, the amount of time someone can list their entire residence for rent on Airbnb is limited to 90 days each year; Amsterdam puts that limit at 30 nights per year, Paris at 120 days. Berlin previously banned nearly all Airbnbs but walked the decision back in 2018."
