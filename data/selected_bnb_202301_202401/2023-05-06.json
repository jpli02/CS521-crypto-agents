        "title": "Stream It or Skip It: 'When Love Springs' on Hallmark, Where a Gorgeous Lily Pond Steals the Whole Movie - Decider",
        "content": "Hallmark delivers seasonal romance in When Love Springs, a movie set at an idyllic B&B nestled in the greenest scenery we\u2019ve seen on the network this year. Rhiannon Fish and James O\u2019Halloran star in an out-of-season fake relationship romance movie, proving that people need fake boyfriends all year long and not just during the holidays. But is When Love Springs the real deal or is this film more of a forgettable fling?\n\nWHEN LOVE SPRINGS: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?\n\nThe Gist: Rhiannon Fish (a standout in March\u2019s A Picture of Her) plays Rory, an overworked junior publicist who\u2019s managed to squeeze in a few days away from New York City to attend her parents\u2019 renewal of their vows at the bed and breakfast where they first met. But just because she\u2019s away from NYC doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s away from work. This is also a working trip for her! And that\u2019s gonna be hard for Rory, because Lily Lake is the quaintest of quaint B&Bs. That means there is no Wi-Fi, no business center \u2014 and even if she wanted to actually enjoy a vacation, there are also no pool or TVs either. Who\u2019s running this place?!\n\nThat would be Noah (James O\u2019Halloran), the grandson of Lily Lake\u2019s original owner. Noah\u2019s not really the owner, though; he\u2019s just looking after the place while his dad\u2019s away. But suddenly his easy gig of checking in guests and mowing the lawn becomes incredibly stressful when he learns that a major travel critic is dropping in a week early. Surprise!\n\nAnd somehow that\u2019s not the only surprise at Lily Lake this weekend. Rory\u2019s ex Jason (Callan Colley) just so happens to be at the B&B with his new girlfriend. To save herself from some embarrassment, Rory latches onto Noah and the two become a \u201ccouple.\u201d What could go wrong?\n\nPhoto: Hallmark\n\nWhat Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Just think of any holiday movie centered around a fake relationship and swap out all the snow for sunshine and the holly for lily pads.\n\nPerformance Worth Watching: In a movie where most of the performances are cruising along at a comfortable speed, I cherished every time Frankie Savige appeared as Rory\u2019s boss Melody. The performance is pure 0-to-100, take-no-prisoners villainy. It felt like she was yelling at me, and I\u2019m not even a junior publicist.\n\nMemorable Dialogue: Speaking of Melody, love when she snarls at Rory, \u201cMissing deadlines is not on brand, Rory. Making mistakes is not on brand.\u201d\n\nSex and Skin:\n\nOur Take: A Hallmark movie is a promise. Not to sound like a greeting card, but it\u2019s kinda true! We know going into Hallmark movies that they aren\u2019t going for Emmy wins, nor are they going for acclaim. They don\u2019t exist to challenge viewers. They\u2019re comfort food, like a slice of cheesecake. Maybe they\u2019re a guilty pleasure, like eating a whole cheesecake. The one thing we can really hold these movies to is the promise they make via their premise. Does the movie deliver what it says it\u2019s going to deliver?\n\nPhoto: Hallmark\n\nOn that metric, When Love Springs is a little bit of a letdown. Hallmark has many formulas on tap, and When Love Springs is like going to a soda fountain expecting Coke and getting Diet Pepsi. We\u2019re promised a fake relationship romp, but that\u2019s not ultimately what we get. The fake-boyfriend plot is introduced, yes, but it\u2019s barely touched upon over the course of the movie. There are very few moments where they\u2019re almost caught, or where they have to improvise a fake backstory on the spot. In fact, Rory and Noah spend most of the movie alone together, which means they have no one to fool. The formula is fun because of the fooling! Instead, When Love Springs feels more like the standard Hallmark movie where a big city woman finds love (and starts a small business) out in the country. It\u2019s a totally different formula.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame because you can see where, if the movie had stuck to its premise promise, it could have been something a little bit unique \u2014 even a little bit more complex than what we\u2019re used to seeing in these kinds of movies. Both Noah and Rory have reasons to want to have a fake relationship: Rory wants to save face in front of her ex, and Noah has a travel critic coming who could either save or shut down his family\u2019s B&B. There\u2019s a missed connection, though, and instead of tying these two plots together \u2014 what if the travel critic was under the assumption that the B&B was run by a couple, or mistook Rory for the owner, or \u2014 the movie punts the travel critic\u2019s arrival so far down the runtime that it\u2019s practically not even part of the movie. It would have been a lot of fun to see both Rory and Noah trying to solve two problems with one fake relationship!\n\nThere are standouts in When Love Springs, namely Rhiannon Fish and the scenery. Fish is playing a completely different character from the one she played in A Picture of Her. Rory is broader and more comedic, and Fish really gets to show off her comedic timing in the very few moments of acting she gets to do as Noah\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d And the lily pond that the third act is centered on is worth the attention. We love traveling to new places vicariously through Hallmark movies, and at least When Love Springs makes good on that promise.\n\nOur Call: SKIP IT. When Love Springs feels like a very by-the-numbers version of Hallmark\u2019s classic formula instead of being a fresh take on a more modern one."
