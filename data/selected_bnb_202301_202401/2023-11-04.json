        "title": "Dogecoin Keeps Low Profile Amid Crypto Market Surge \u2014 Can DOGE Still Reach $1 Price? - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nDogecoin, the world\u2019s largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has managed to fly under the radar despite the recent surge in the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhile major cryptocurrencies have been making headlines, Dogecoin has quietly surged just over 9% in the past seven days, riding the wave of the overall market surge and briefly touching a high of 0.07466 last Thursday.\n\nThis surge is particularly noteworthy as Dogecoin had languished in a lull since June 2022, with the crypto consolidating sideways and finding a yearly low around the $0.06 mark. However, earlier last week, its price managed to break out of this slump, offering a glimmer of hope for DOGE enthusiasts.\n\nNotably, the resurgence in Dogecoin\u2019s value is linked to the broader market resurgence, which has been ignited by heightened market optimism surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in recent weeks.\n\nThat said, following the recent surge, crypto experts have also pointed to technical indicators suggesting a potential breakout for Dogecoin. On Sunday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted positive candlestick patterns and a TD Sequential buy signal, indicating that Dogecoin might be poised for a significant move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDogecoin shows promising signs, breaking out from a multi-year descending triangle on the DOGE weekly chart! The confirmation of a buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator within this timeframe reinforces DOGE bullish outlook.\u201d Wrote Ali.\n\nMoreover, an intriguing \u201cDouble Bottom\u201d pattern has emerged when viewed in the four-hour timeframe, with some experts saying it could potentially propel Dogecoin up by 20%, dependent on favourable market conditions.\n\nNonetheless, challenges persist for Dogecoin as it encounters a significant resistance point at the $0.075 mark. To increase its recovery, the price must remain above the initial support level of $0.067. Should this condition be met, it opens the door for a potential additional 20% recovery, with a target price set at $0.085.\n\nThat said, the lingering question that hangs over Dogecoin is whether it can ever attain the much-anticipated milestone of $1. It shall be recalled that in May 2021, Dogecoin soared to an all-time high of $0.73 during the cryptocurrency market\u2019s bullish phase. Yet, despite the passionate endorsement of Elon Musk, the coin later descended into a downturn, effectively adding an extra zero to its valuation.\n\nSome experts have suggested that the prospects for Dogecoin reaching $1 by the end of the decade in 2030 appear slim. Notably, reaching this psychological threshold would require a substantial 1,200% increase from its current value.\n\nAccording to one Dogecoin enthusiast, the maximum value Dogecoin could reach is $0.61, possibly in 2028, falling short of its previous all-time high. In a more pessimistic scenario, he noted that Dogecoin\u2019s value could dip to $0.12 between 2029 and 2030.\n\nAt press time, DOGE was trading at $0.068 after a 1.15% drop over the past 24 hours."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nA dormant whale wallet containing a staggering 5,392,984 Dogecoins has suddenly come back to life after lying dormant for 9.8 years, sparking curiosity in the crypto community.\n\nAccording to a Saturday tweet by Whale Alert, a firm specialising in tracking abnormal crypto transactions, this mysterious wallet had been inactive since 2014. During this prolonged inactivity, the wallet\u2019s contents remained untouched even as the cryptocurrency market underwent a significant transformation. That said, considering Dogecoin\u2019s current trading prices, the wallet\u2019s value has appreciated by an astonishing 80,000% to roughly $376,758 since its last activity.\n\nMeanwhile, the return of this long-dormant Dogecoin wallet has prompted speculation about the owner\u2019s motivations. Some in the crypto community believe it could signify renewed interest in the coin. In contrast, others wonder if it\u2019s a speculative move aimed at capitalizing on the current hype surrounding Dogecoin.\n\nFurthermore, some have also argued that the wallet addresses belong to the original creator of the meme crypto. On the other hand, some speculate that this could be due to the recent surge in the price of Dogecoin, which has seen a 9.5% increase in the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nThere are also concerns about the potential impact of such a massive holder on the market, as large transactions could influence the cryptocurrency price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, while rare for Dogecoin compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, this is not the first time a Dogecoin whale has reawakened after such lengthy slumbers. In June, a whale address with over 2 million Dogecoin was reactivated after almost 9.5 years of inactivity. Similarly, in May of the same year, a dormant address containing 1,556,994 DOGE was reactivated after 9.3 years.\n\nDogecoin, created initially as a meme cryptocurrency in 2013, has gained a significant following and seen its value surge. The coin\u2019s popularity has been attributed to endorsements from prominent figures like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban, who have expressed support for Dogecoin through social media and other platforms. While Dogecoin was created as a lighthearted joke, it has evolved into the largest meme coin and paved the way for numerous other creations, including Shiba Inu and PEPE.\n\nAt press time, DOGE was trading at $0.068 after a 0.77% increase over the past 24 hours."
