        "content": "Binance Global, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, has acknowledged flaws in its systems that under-collateralized its BNB Smart Chain-based BUSD stablecoin by up to US$1 billion on at least three occasions, according to a Wednesday report from Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nSee related article: Binance stablecoin conversion controversial, but what does it mean for users?\n\nFast facts\n\nThe token, otherwise known as Binance-pegged BUSD, is designed to maintain a stable value of US$1 via reserves of another version of BUSD running on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum-based BUSD is collateralized by U.S. dollars and is overseen by New York-based financial technology firm Paxos Trust Company, LLC. Binance claims this version is fully backed by fiat.\n\n\u201cThe process of maintaining the backing involves many teams and has not always been flawless, which may have resulted in operational delays in the past,\u201d a Binance spokesperson said, according to Bloomberg. \u201cRecently, the process has been much improved with enhanced discrepancy checks to ensure it\u2019s always backed 1 [to] 1.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added that no customers were impacted despite these discrepancies, but did not confirm how long the Binance-pegged BUSD was uncollateralized for in total nor when the company first became aware of the issue.\n\nBinance made a controversial decision in September to convert customers\u2019 holdings of three stablecoins, USDC, Pax Dollar (USDP) and True USD (TUSD), into BUSD, in a move the company said would \u201cenhance liquidity and capital efficiency for users.\u201d\n\nStablecoins play a major part in the crypto industry by allowing investors to maintain a constant value within the often-volatile ecosystem. Four of the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are stablecoins \u2014 including BUSD which currently has the seventh highest market cap in the industry with US$16.4 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nBinance-pegged BUSD was designed to allow the stablecoin to operate on Binance\u2019s own blockchain and accounts for US$5.4 billion of BUSD\u2019s total market cap.\n\nSee related article: Binance move to remove USDC and others raise questions about market conduct\n\n(Updated to clarify in headline stablecoin was BUSD-peg.)"

More than 100 families are being booked into B&Bs every month across the city as the town hall struggles to find suitable accommodation for those becoming homeless.\n\nB&Bs and hotels can only be used as temporary accommodation for families in 'exceptional circumstances' and for no more than six weeks. But every month, more and more families are staying in B&Bs for longer than 42 days.\n\nIt comes four years after a Manchester Evening News investigation revealed the squalid living conditions faced by the city's 'hidden homeless' population. But last month, the newspaper found that families were still being housed under the same roof as alcoholics, sex offenders and infestations of rats.\n\nREAD MORE: Five things Manchester is doing to tackle homelessness now\n\nManchester council has now committed to an 'ambitious' target of having no families placed in B&Bs for longer than six weeks by the end of June, with no more than 10 families placed in this type of accommodation by the end of the year. To do this, the town hall will need to find alternative accommodation.\n\nCouncillors were presented with plans to invest in more suitable temporary accommodation and prevent people becoming homeless in the first place at a scrutiny meeting on Tuesday (January 10). The report also explained that the move should save the council money because of the high cost of using B&Bs.\n\nLabour councillor Julie Reid was shocked by the 'huge amount' spent by the local authority on this unsuitable type of temporary accommodation. She said: \"On economies of scale, surely we could buy something better?\n\n(Image: Manchester City Council)\n\n\"For example, some of our hotels are now working in partnership with us. Surely they can offer us a better deal than that.\n\n\"I'm sure if I went on booking.com I could get it cheaper. Why are we paying this amount of money?\"\n\nAssistant director of homelessness Rob McCartney responded, saying: \"We're not going to enter into agreements with hotels or bed and breakfasts for families because it's unlawful to place families in bed and breakfast.\n\n\"But the alternative is, as we've set out, the leasing arrangement where we estimate, currently, if we were to place 200 families in these self-contained units rather than bed and breakfast, we would be saving \u00a37m per year and we would be providing a decent level of accommodation to families as well.\"\n\nThe local authority is looking at leasing more self-contained accommodation from private providers to be used as an alternative to B&Bs, with 200 properties expected to be available by the end of March. This will cost \u00a37.9m over five years, but using costly B&Bs less should save approximately \u00a334m.\n\nThe council is also changing policies with the aim of preventing homelessness. This includes allowing people to live temporarily with friends and family if they become homeless without losing their place in the queue for social housing.\n\nThe council will also consider providing one-off financial assistance to people who are at risk of being evicted by private landlords. It is hoped that this new approach will relieve some pressure on the demand for temporary housing.\n\nRead more of today's top stories here.\n\nREAD NEXT:"

        "content": "The overall crypto markets are off to a strong start this year, but downside risks still exist due to mounting liquidity worries in the aftermath of FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\nWe hereby present you a list of crypto assets that are helping investors to make money in 2023.\n\nLido DAO: So far this year, Lido DAO (LDO) is one of the top-performing large-cap altcoins. The liquid staking protocol began trading in 2023 at $0.959 and is currently trading at $1.97, a startling 105% increase in less than two weeks.\n\nLido was created to make it easier to invest in popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC). In addition to providing an easy-to-use platform, it allows investors to stake their assets with little initial investment.\n\nSolana (SOL): This smart contract platform has also had a banner year. The main competitor to Ethereum (ETH) gained more than 59%, rising from $10.15 on January 1 to $16.17 at the time of writing.\n\nBonk Coin (BONK), a meme coin created for the Solana community to re-energize itself, has drawn a lot of purchasers to the altcoin which has contributed to Solana\u2019s growth. Although it has subsequently calmed off, the new Dogecoin clone from Solana is still trading at a premium of 957% above its initial price.\n\nCardano: This is a different large-cap token that will become popular in 2023. (ADA). The smart contract protocol has risen sharply from $0.249 to $0.327 as of this writing, a respectable 31% gain in less than two weeks.\n\nLitecoin (LTC): This peer-to-peer payment network started 2023 at $70.06 and is currently trading at $82.43, representing a respectable 17% gain thus far this year.\n\nBinance Coin: The utility token of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Binance Coin (BNB), has increased in value by more than 14% in less than two weeks, from $244.01 at the beginning of 2023 to its current value of $278.16.\n\nBNB\u2019s solid fundamentals might be part of the explanation for its comparatively high performance. BNB is a vital part of the ecosystem of Binance, a reputable and well-established exchange. BNB is also supported by a variety of well-known alliances and partnerships, which raises its stature and appeal.\n\nAlso posting descent gains is Avalanche (AVAX), a protocol for smart contracts.AVAX has risen 13.84% to start the year after bouncing from $10.98 to $12.50 as of this writing.\n\nAvalanche: In the GameFi ecosystem, Avalanche has seen tremendous growth that could be useful in 2023. The Japanese media giant GREE revealed ambitions to create Web3 games using Avalanche.\n\nPolkadot: Interoperable blockchain Polkadot (DOT), which rose 12.59% from $4.37 on January 1 to $4.92 at the time of writing, is also quietly printing gains. Polkadot, among other things, aspires to provide the IT framework for a decentralized web, which will have blockchain at its core in addition to other projects.\n\nPolygon (MATIC): This scalability solution for blockchains is also moving forward. MATIC bulls are showing off their might, pushing the alternative coin from $0.768 on January 1 to $0.855 at the time of writing, an 11% increase.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has formed numerous alliances with industries outside of the cryptocurrency market, strengthening the expansion of Layer 2\u2019s ecosystem, investors are placing their bets on the utility token. The long list includes businesses like Starbucks, Nubank, and Mastercard.\n\nEthereum: Ethereum isn\u2019t also lagging amid significant buying pressures. Over the same period, the top smart contract protocol saw growth of almost 9%. ETH\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade, which allows users to un-stake their Ether, has likely sparked investors\u2019 interest in the world\u2019s most popular altcoin."
