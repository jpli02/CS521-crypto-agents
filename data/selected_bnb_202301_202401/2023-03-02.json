        "content": "What happens when you combine a dubious crypto project, a rekt investor, and a wealthy founder enjoying his profits? A fight in an upscale shopping center, of course.\n\nProminent Venezuelan crypto influencer Newman Perez was earlier this month confronted at a Colombian shopping center by a man who accused him of stealing his funds. The confrontation, caught on camera, was uploaded to TikTok, shared on Twitter, and has since gone viral.\n\n\"Did you not steal from me? What do you call that? A scam,\" said the man, who then addressed the crowd to share his opinions about Perez. \"I present to you Colombia\u2019s number one scammer.\"\n\nEncararon a Newman P\u00e9rez en un restaurante y estaba cagadisimo pic.twitter.com/v0fDm2jPIm \u2014 Whitezuelans (@whitezuelans) February 9, 2023\n\nPerez is actually Venezuelan, though currently lives in Colombia because he is wanted in Venezuela on charges of \u201ccontinuous aggravated fraud, threats against a public official, alteration of goods, and private violence,\u201d according to local media Caraota Digital.\n\nThe influencer, who has an Instagram following of more than 668,000, has launched several businesses in the past. One of his oldest and best-known initiatives is the website Apreciodepana.com, which, according to Perez, was backed by Google Ventures. Decrypt has not been able to verify this claim, and representatives for Google Ventures have not replied to requests for comment.\n\nPerez\u2019s other businesses include MacStore Venezuela, DivisasToGo, and several trading and financial coaching courses. Among his more questionable ventures was the illegal renting of Zelle accounts, which led to his Twitter account being banned.\n\nDays after the viral video was uploaded, Perez said on his Instagram account that it was all a \u201csocial experiment\u201d\u2014perhaps as a way to save face\u2014and then redirected his followers to a press release published in Forbes, promoting his latest crypto project BNB Beats.\n\nBNB Beats controversy\n\nBNB Beats, a crypto app on the BNB Chain, claims that it generates daily returns of 1% and 3% per day on any amount invested by its users. Its white paper doesn\u2019t explain what it does but says it focuses on \u201cincreasing the quality of life of people\u201d through education, trust, and innovation.\n\nRecently, DappBay\u2014an app hub created by Binance in July 2022\u2014issued a red alert notice on Perez\u2019s BNB Beats. That essentially means it\u2019s been flagged as a scam. \"The contract executes differently from what the project owners announced, and that inequality (between what was announced and what was actually executed) will lead to unexpected results,\" said DappBay.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerez criticized DappBay's audit and directed his followers to instead read an audit from HazeCrypto, a competitor to DappBay. \"Do you want to see a real audit??? Well, look at HazeCrypto's,\" he said in his Telegram group.\n\nHazeCrypto\u2019s audit says the BNB Beats smart contract has no vulnerabilities. However, the audit warns that deposited funds cannot be withdrawn and that dividends are paid from new users' deposits\u2014the textbook definition of a Ponzi scheme.\n\nHazeCrypto's audit of BNB Beats. Source: HazeCrypto\n\nAt the moment, BNB Beats V3 alone has 3,673 users and just over 544 BNB (roughly $164,000) in total value locked, according to HazeCrypto metrics \u2014not counting his other projects. The BNB Beats\u2019 whitepaper estimates a 333,233% return-on-investment between January 2023 and April 2025."

        "title": "Fine-dining restaurant in northern Maine adds bed and breakfast - Bangor Daily News",
        "content": "FORT FAIRFIELD, Maine \u2014 After creating a European-inspired culinary experience in rural northern Maine, two chefs have expanded the business to include a bed and breakfast.\n\nCanterbury Royale and the cottage are the visions of Barbara Boucher and Renee O\u2019Neill.\n\nThe longtime chefs created Canterbury Royale in 2008 on a country road in Fort Fairfield. The restaurant serves weekly five-course dinners to guests who often travel there from throughout Maine and Canada.\n\nBut the pandemic sparked a new plan. When COVID-19 forced them to close in 2020, they created the cottage, a place that transports overnight guests to Europe\u2019s Victorian and Edwardian eras. Their goal: give people from near and far an experience they can\u2019t get elsewhere in The County.\n\n\u201cWhen people come here, they come for the full experience: the music, food and customer service,\u201d Boucher said.\n\nThe cottage opened for guests in March 2022, with Canterbury Royale\u2019s main dining room reopening last summer. Boucher estimated that she and O\u2019Neil have since served 50 to 60 people per month, including overnight guests.\n\nCustomers helped inspire the addition. Over the years, more and more guests suggested Canterbury Royale add a bed and breakfast to its repertoire.\n\nSo over a year and a half, Boucher and O\u2019Neill transformed a once-empty structure into a cottage for guests just a walking path away from the main house.\n\nThey renovated the interior from scratch, from the floorboards to the yellow and white wallpaper. O\u2019Neill crafted hand-painted wooden beams to hide the modern air-conditioning unit.\n\nThere are yellow-and-white-tiled floors, living room and kitchen chairs and a small stove and cabinet set. The adjacent bedroom features a wooden bed frame that O\u2019Neill constructed and carved, as well as a small, hand-carved wooden storage chest with a winter village scene.\n\nPeople often wonder why two serious chefs would put down roots in Fort Fairfield, of all places, Boucher said. But the chefs think the surrounding 15-acre forest, including their own planted evergreen trees, complements their vision.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a cooler and quieter climate. The landscape and countryside are beautiful,\u201d Boucher said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many people have asked what we are doing in a former potato field.\u201d\n\nBoucher and O\u2019Neill, natives of Connecticut and New York, respectively, spent their early careers training at culinary arts institutes on the East Coast. The pair, also musicians, met through music lessons.\n\nAfter honing their craft since their early 20s, they decided to find the most remote place they could find to open their business. They wanted to bring their European flair where people otherwise would not experience culinary dining.\n\nEntrees often include fanciful choices like encrusted lamb chops with red wine reduction or salmon Wellington with Pernod sauce.\n\nClassical music drifts through the room as guests eat and drink from china plates and crystal glasses. Boucher and O\u2019Neill cook and serve, traveling from the kitchen to the dining room, sometimes with as many as 30 plates total for larger groups.\n\n\u201cCooking is all about math. You\u2019re calculating when each dish will come as soon as the guests walk in the door,\u201d Boucher said. \u201cWe pride ourselves on knowing what our guests want before they say it.\u201d\n\nIngenuity and a passion for the finest experiences are what motivate the chefs to keep welcoming people back to their enchanted forest.\n\n\u201cPeople feel transported as soon as they pull into the driveway,\u201d Boucher said."

        "content": "Buffalo Wild Wings introduced two new sauce combos for the 2023 March Madness NCAA tournament./Photo courtesy of Buffalo Wild Wings.\n\nSuper Bowl is a big day for restaurants serving wings, pizza and nachos\u2014but it\u2019s only one day.\n\nLess than a month later comes college basketball\u2019s NCAA tournament\u2014the sports spectacular known as March Madness that stretches more than three weeks.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of opportunity to lure fans with food, drink and themed promotions.\n\nBuffalo Wild Wings made a mad dash to be first out on the court.

        "content": "BNB\n\nThe project allows users to tweet with the hashtag #TwitFi and earn tokens - directly from the Twitter App.\n\nTwitFi on BNB Chain\n\nTweet-to-Earn project TwitFi is gearing up to launch on BNB Chain. Currently running on Ethereum, the project allows users to earn its in-game token (TWT) by simply holding bird NFTs and adding #TwitFi to their usual tweets. The tokens can be used in-game or cashed in for profit.\n\nThe launch on BNB Chain will follow an NFT presale scheduled for March 11 and available to Whitelist holders only. At the NFT presale, each NFT will be available for $40. Post-launch, the NFTs will go for $50 each.\n\nTwitFi NFT presale will also be available on Gate NFT and will not require a whitelist spot for Gate.io account holders. Only 400 NFT will be available through Gate NFT.\n\nWhat is TwitFi\n\nTwitFi is a viral marketing hub building a new category with three components: DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi. The project combines the three elements to turn various users into contributors and build a sustainable community. Crypto projects can use TwitFi as a marketing tool, players can use it as a game, and investors can use it for reward purposes.\n\nTwitFi Milestones\n\nLaunched in December 2022, TwitFi has continued to grow rapidly. 75% of NFT sales were used by the team to purchase TWT and add liquidity which led to a significant price increase within the first few days of launch. The project currently has over 30,000 users. Since users tweet daily with the TwitFi hashtag, #TwitFi has trended several times on Twitter.\n\nWhy BNB Expansion?\n\nTwitFi has chosen to move to BNB Chain for a number of key reasons. Firstly, Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees and slow transaction times have become a major pain point for users. Also, on Ethereum, illegal NFT minting and several bugs resulted in an over-breeding of bird NFTs that could earn TWT. The team has fixed these bugs and re-established the ecosystem for a sustainable GameFi model.\n\nThe value of TWT declined significantly due to an inadequate system. However, the team has implemented a restructuring of the ecosystem on BNB Chain. It is being developed in such a way that contributions on BNB Chain will boost the value on Ethereum.\n\nHow the GamePlay Works\n\nBy holding and leveling up bird NFTs, you can increase the amount of TWT you earn. Holding multiple bird NFTs will result in even more TWT earnings.\n\nThe bird NFT's level impacts the number of daily tweets and the amount of tokens earned per tweet. Leveling up requires waiting for several days, but there is an item available that reduces the waiting time. Bird NFTs may be infected with a virus while tweeting, which prevents them from earning TWT. To cure the virus, users will have to wait for 7 days or use medicine items. Bird NFT will be burned after 20 virus infections.\n\nThere are numerous items that can be acquired for more efficient gameplay and traded on OpenSea. When you tweet, you might also get a Mystery Basket that contains items that can be traded on OpenSea.\n\nBenefits Over Other GameFi projects\n\nTwitFi does not require any kind of special action. Users simply need to add the hashtag to their usual tweets to earn the in-game token, TWT.\n\nTwitFi provides a service known as TwitFi Sky, which operates through external project funding and subsequently rewards TwitFi players. By relying on external funding, the team is fostering a sustainable GameFi environment. Through TwitFi Sky, external projects and companies can assign tasks to TwitFi players such as following a designated account or using a particular hashtag in their tweets. With tens of thousands of TwitFi players tweeting a particular hashtag together, the subject becomes the topic of discussion on Twitter.\n\nBy offering this service and funneling the revenue back into the ecosystem, TwitFi is actively building a sustainable GameFi economy.\n\nTwitFi Future Plans\n\nThe team plans to develop a game on TwitFi that will reflect communication on Twitter. The game content is such that items are grown and earned through communication on Twitter.\n\nThey are also developing the AI to identify the content of tweets and actions to tweets with specific hashtags, and score them.\n\nLearn more about TwitFi and stay updated with its developments via the following links:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Whitepaper |\n\n\u200d"

        "title": "How to Sell SafeMoon on Trust Wallet - A Complete Guide - Latest Cryptocurrency Prices & Articles",
        "content": "The digital world is expanding exponentially, which has made it possible for cryptocurrencies to exist as a virtual form of value exchange. Crypto enthusiasts already understand how crypto works, which allows them to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies to profit from them. This article looks at how to sell SafeMoon on Trust Wallet.\n\nHowever, remember that for cryptocurrency tokens such as SafeMoon, traders can\u2019t make direct purchases and sales. Instead, they will be required to use other alternatives to achieve a means to an end.\n\nSafeMoon was one of the cryptocurrencies that increased prices by over 10,000% when it launched, but it has fallen quite a bit due to the bear market. Besides, there are some cryptocurrencies that users can get for free \u2013 from crypto airdrops.\n\nHow to Sell SafeMoon on Trust Wallet \u2013 Introduction\n\nThose who have bought SafeMoon tokens may find it challenging to make a sale of these tokens, as they cannot be sold directly through existing common exchanges. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to understand how SafeMoon holders can maneuver to sell their tokens and get Fiat currency.\n\nThis article aims to guide interested sellers on how to sell SafeMoon on Trust Wallet. While the process may seem challenging, understanding the concepts will make it easier.\n\nAbout SafeMoon\n\nSafeMoon is a cryptocurrency token established on the Binance Smart Chain. It was launched in March 2021 and had a market cap of over $3.5 million at the time of writing.\n\nSafeMoon Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) token that combines RFI tokenomics and auto-liquidity generating protocol. It has three functions, Reflection, LP Acquisition, and Burn, which occur during each trade. By holding SAFEMOON tokens, users can earn up to 80% APY, thanks to its coin-burning strategy. The protocol plans to develop an NFT exchange, charity projects, and crypto educational apps.\n\nThe project aims to encourage crypto enthusiasts to make long-term investments and discourage selling by charging a 10% fee for each sale.\n\nAs for the SafeMoon tokens, they have very high volatility; therefore, those taking advantage of them end up securing outstanding profits. It is, however, essential to understanding that SafeMoon tokens cannot be sold directly on existing decentralized exchanges; there are alternative methods to complete the action, as explained in this article.\n\nSafeMoon V2\n\nIn December 2021, SafeMoon developed a second version of their token, called SafeMoon V2 (SFM). It is an updated version of the SafeMoon contract, and all the holders must migrate their tokens to SFM, or else they will be charged a 100% fee.\n\nFurthermore, SafeMoon released a decentralized exchange called \u201cSafeMoon Swap\u201d; this is the only space for migration to SFM.\n\nSafeMoon is advancing its mission to create innovations for good and establish a Venture Philanthropy model to ensure they reach every corner of the world. Token holders can earn more SAFEMOON based on their number of tokens, and the coin-burning strategy makes it a deflationary digital currency that gains value over time.\n\nAccording to the official website, the CEO of SafeMoon is John Karony.\n\nAbout Trust Wallet\n\nBefore learning how to sell SafeMoon on Trust Wallet, let\u2019s find some information about this service.\n\nTrust Wallet is a non-custodial wallet that offers complete control over cryptocurrencies and NFTs and is the official wallet of Binance. It supports over 65 blockchains and more than 4.5 million digital assets. Trust Wallet is unique because it allows access to decentralized applications (dApps), making it easy and safe to interact with various dApps across different blockchains.\n\nWith Trust Wallet, users can buy, send, receive, stake, trade, and store cryptocurrencies. It is a hot wallet that is connected to the internet, providing the flexibility to manage assets anytime and anywhere.\n\nWhile Trust Wallet is user-friendly, users may face issues if their account is compromised, as customer service cannot guide them to recover seed phrases to reclaim access to their assets.\n\nTrust Wallet is also a popular choice for free crypto airdrops and is available on Android, iOS and as a browser extension.\n\nHow to Sell SafeMoon on Trust Wallet\n\nTo successfully sell SafeMoon on Trust Wallet, the seller must create an account on Binance, as SafeMoon runs on the Binance blockchain, and also this is the easier way.\n\nTherefore, through the help of the Binance blockchain, the seller can easily convert SafeMoon tokens into Binance coins. To successfully achieve this, a user should follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Download the Trust Wallet app and Create a Wallet/Log into a Trust Wallet Account\n\nTo get started with Trust Wallet, the first step is to download the app from the iOS App Store or the Android Google Play Store. Using the Trust Wallet app to sell SafeMoon is much easier and more user-friendly than the browser extension. After downloading, users can create a new wallet and receive a 12-word recovery phrase. This phrase is crucial and must be carefully documented and secured as a backup key to access the funds. Keeping the phrase safe is vital to ensure the safety of the assets stored in the Trust Wallet.\n\nIf you have an existing account, just log in.\n\nOnce the seller has a working Trust Wallet account, they will then be able to access the main page, where they will see a SafeMoon address. Sellers are advised to look keenly at the amount of SafeMoon tokens they hold in their wallets before proceeding to the next step.\n\nStep 2: Go to Your Wallet\n\nThe next step to selling SafeMoon with Trust Wallet involves accessing the SafeMoon Wallet. To initiate the transaction, users need to copy the SafeMoon token\u2019s address from the project\u2019s main page and ensure that they have sufficient funds in their account before proceeding with the transaction. This verification step is essential to ensure the seamless and successful selling of SafeMoon tokens.\n\nStep 3: Open PancakeSwap in the Trust Wallet Browser Tab\n\nTo proceed, access PancakeSwap through your Trust Wallet DApp browser selection. You may select this platform or another depending on your trading or exchange objectives. However, for SafeMoon transactions, PancakeSwap stands as the optimal choice. After accessing PancakeSwap, log into the platform using your Trust Wallet.\n\nStep 4: Swap SafeMoon Tokens for BNB\n\nTo initiate the swap process:\n\nNavigate to PancakeSwap, choose \u201cTrade\u201d tab from the bottom left corner and select the BNB symbol under the \u201cFrom\u201d section. This will take you to a search bar where you can type in \u201cSafeMoon\u201d and select it. Keep in mind that a 10% fee is included in the transaction. Agree to the terms and conditions and proceed by entering the desired amount of SafeMoon tokens and clicking on the blue icon.\n\nOnce you have clicked both the \u201cSwap\u201d and \u201cConfirm Swap\u201d buttons, a fee breakdown page for the BNB network will appear. Click on \u201cSend\u201d to complete the final step. Your transaction status will then be updated to \u201cSuccess.\u201d\n\nBy performing this step and exchanging your SafeMoon for another coin, you will easily withdraw your funds.\n\nStep 5: Convert BNB Smart Chain to Binance Chain\n\nAfter swapping your SafeMoon for BNB coins, return to Trust Wallet to proceed with the next step. The Smart Chain must be converted to the Binance Chain, which can be accomplished by selecting \u201cSmart Chain\u201d and then clicking the \u201cSwap\u201d icon.\n\nFrom there, choose \u201cSwap to Binance Chain,\u201d insert the amount and proceed with the transaction. A confirmation will be required, and once completed, the BNB Smart Chain will be successfully converted to the Binance Chain.\n\nYou can now view your BNB coins on the main page of the Trust Wallet App and exchange them with an external crypto wallet address if desired.\n\nStep 6: Send BNB to Binance\n\nTo successfully sell your SafeMoon and withdraw funds to your fiat bank account, you must send your BNB coins to your Binance account. Binance is the recommended exchange since BNB is the native token, and users will have lower fees.\n\nThis step is crucial. To begin, select \u201cSend\u201d and keep the tab open. Navigate to your Binance account and access your wallet to start the withdrawal process. Choose BNB as your preferred crypto coin, and then select \u201cDeposit.\u201d Copy and paste your wallet address and BNB memo number to the Trust Wallet.\n\nThe recipient address details should be entered under the \u201crecipient address\u201d section, while the memo number goes into the corresponding \u201cmemo\u201d space. Next, select \u201cMax\u201d for the amount and proceed to the \u201cNext\u201d button. Once you have reached the confirmation screen, click \u201cSend.\u201d\n\nAfter successfully sending the BNB coins, you will be able to see the SafeMoon exchange in your Binance account, listed under BNB.\n\nStep 7: Convert BNB to Fiat Currency\n\nAfter accessing your Binance account:\n\nNavigate to the \u201cBuy crypto\u201d option and choose BNB as your selling coin. Enter the desired currency for your payment option. If you are based in the United States, select the \u201cUSD\u201d option. After selecting the preferred currency, click \u201cmax\u201d and then proceed to the \u201cSell BNB\u201d option to begin selling. This will enable you to sell your SafeMoon for your desired currency, in this example, EUR.\n\nThe next step is the moment we have all been waiting for: withdrawing your funds into your bank account!\n\nStep 8: Withdraw Money from Binance to Your Bank Account\n\nAfter successfully selling your BNB for your preferred fiat currency, such as USD, it\u2019s time to make a withdrawal request. To do this, go to the \u201cFiat and Spot\u201d option on the Binance page and make sure to verify your account before initiating the withdrawal process to ensure a smooth transaction.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow Can I Withdraw SafeMoon from Trust Wallet? / How to Cash Out Safemoon from Trust Wallet?\n\nTo withdraw SafeMoon from Trust Wallet or cash out, follow these steps:\n\nDownload the Trust Wallet app and create a wallet or log into an existing account. Access the SafeMoon wallet and copy the token address to verify you have enough funds to proceed. Open PancakeSwap in the Trust Wallet browser tab and swap your SafeMoon tokens for BNB coins. Convert the BNB Smart Chain to the Binance Chain. Send the BNB coins to your Binance account. Convert the BNB coins to your preferred fiat currency (e.g., USD). Withdraw your funds from Binance to your bank account.\n\nBelow you have a complete step-by-step guide with examples to follow.\n\nHow to Transfer SafeMoon from Trust Wallet to Coinbase?\n\nTo transfer your cryptocurrency from Trust Wallet to Coinbase, you must first copy the asset\u2019s address from Coinbase. Begin by opening the Coinbase app and selecting \u201cReceive\u201d to obtain the address.\n\nNext, open the Trust Wallet app and choose the crypto asset you wish to send. Paste the copied Coinbase address and confirm the transfer. Finally, check your Coinbase account to ensure the transfer was successful.\n\nIn other words, the steps are almost the same as in Binance. The major aspect that differs is that the transaction cannot take place through the BNB Smart Chain.\n\nHow to Add SafeMoon to Trust Wallet?\n\nFrom the wallet menu of the Trust Wallet app, click on Add Tokens, search for the currency you want to add, in our case SafeMoon, and then confirm.\n\nHow to Sell Safemoon Crypto on Trust Wallet without Binance\n\nIn this article, we have discussed how to sell SafeMoon on Trust Wallet using Binance. As mentioned above, it is impossible to sell SafeMoon directly, and those who wish to sell their SafeMoon tokens will need to use an exchange that can hold Binance tokens.\n\nThose who wish to sell it without using Binance will need to choose a swappable token with SafeMoon.
