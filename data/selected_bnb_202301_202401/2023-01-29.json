        "content": "The MATIC token, used by the Ethereum scaling tool Polygon, has increased in value by 12% in the previous day, following the year\u2019s upward trend.\n\nA share in MATIC cost about $1.11 as recently as a few days ago. Since December 31, it has increased by 48% as daily transactions have surged, making the blockchain the second largest in terms of DAU, according to Token Terminal.\n\nThe rally coincides with a general uptick in the cryptocurrency market when bitcoin rose over 40%, Aptos\u2019 APT token was up by over 400%, and the FTM token of Fantom surged by around 145% since early this year.\n\nPolygon is the most popular overall platform behind Binance\u2019s BNB chain, beating Solana and Ethereum.\n\nThe price rise may be due to a number of factors, including speculation about the mainnet launch of Polygon\u2019s zero knowledge-EVM and the company\u2019s recently announced collaborations and launches that have raised DAUs over the previous month. The timeline for the mainnet debut is early 2023. It launched its public testnet for zk-EVM in October.\n\nCharles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture, said they were beginning to see users and interest come back to these sorts of networks and see activity again. More action will be added after several companies built on top of Polygon haven\u2019t published their tokens yet do so.\n\nAccording to DeFi Llama, Polygon has a TVL of around $1.1 billion. Bulk TVL increases are occurring for riskier projects and early-stage applications. When prices are low, investors are wary of taking on too much risk, but now that they\u2019ve seen some improvement, they\u2019re willing to try out riskier ecosystems like Polygon.\n\nAs the market improves, more of it will start to trickle down."

        "content": "This article will address the topic of the performance of crypto assets in 2022 from a systematic point of view. This is certainly a somewhat uncomfortable topic given the performance of the sector in the past year, but it can help to understand how to move within this market.\n\nSpecifically, some of the most capitalized cryptocurrencies will be considered, including BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, including several altcoins.\n\nIn Figure 1 we can see in the \u2018Perf. %\u2019 column how the 2022 performance, for the assets under consideration, was disastrous almost as a whole. All the cryptocurrencies considered saw very severe losses, ranging from -52.5% to -98.5%.\n\nThe best was BNB, which despite the criticism and stresses to which the \u201ccrypto exchange\u201d sector has been subjected following the FTX affair, posts a negative return of 52%, resulting from the opening of the year 2022 that occurred at $518.6 and ended at $246.3.\n\nScrolling down this list there\u2019s also BTC, which scores -64.9%, DOGE -58.9%, ETH at -67.8% and MATIC -70.3%.\n\nBut there are also those who have done worse, such as for example LUNA (-98.5%), whose affair is sadly known to all users of the Terra ecosystem, and with her the whole DeFi sector including among others AAVE (-80.2%), FTM (-90.5%), AVAX (-89.3%) and CRV (-89.8%) who have suffered losses of more than 80%.\n\nEven the Metaverse sector, which was much talked about in the previous year, ended the year as badly as it could have: SAND (-93.5%), MANA (-91%) and AXS (-93.6%) posted even worse returns than other sectors, reaching losses of more than 90%.\n\nA review of the performance of the crypto sector in 2022\n\nAs mentioned, 2022 was disappointing in that it saw heavy losses almost across the entire sector. It certainly left an indelible mark on all investors. It will not be easy to regain confidence right away, but as has happened in the past with Bitcoin (and the crypto sector in general) things can change in a short period of time.\n\nIn fact, proceeding with the analysis, Figure 2 shows how despite the fact that the current year has just begun, there are many cryptocurrencies that are attempting a recovery, such as SOL (+59.9% in the first days of 2023), MANA (+33.5%) and SAND (33.2%), although they are still a long way from what are the \u2018All time highs\u2019 i.e., the absolute highs recorded by the market. Bitcoin in particular has seen a slight rise in the early days of 2023, but the distance from all-time highs still amounts to a whopping -74.95%.\n\nIn short, there is still a long way to go, though we may soon see a new halving of Bitcoin, which is usually preceded by a rebound in Bitcoin that is accompanied by the entire crypto sector.\n\nThe comparison with traditional markets, visible in Figure 3, also highlights how Bitcoin, and the entire crypto world, are still very volatile markets that require study, dedication, and proper risk management before they can be fully understood.\n\nIn particular, QQQ, the ETF that invests in the 100 most capitalized technology stocks in the United States of America, scores a -34% in 2022, as does SPY (ETF on S&P500), which scores a more dignified -20.5%.\n\nNothing compared to the performance of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, which coming from a strong rally have posted somewhat worse returns than the traditional markets.\n\nHowever, the strong correlation that linked markets such as the Nasdaq and the S&P500 to the crypto sector in 2022 remains in the public eye. A sector that was initially considered stand-alone, but which has shown a clear link to traditional finance, particularly with the restrictive policy of central banks.\n\nWe end this overview with TLT, which is an ETF that invests in US bonds with maturities over 20 years, posting a resounding -29.35%.\n\nThus, the only markets that have been exempt from the 2022 drubbing are USO (an ETF that invests in oil) and GLD (an ETF that invests in gold), which mark +22.2% and +1.26%, respectively.\n\nWhile we wait to see what surprises 2023 will bring, we warmly urge you to use extreme caution in the markets to avoid overexposures that could seriously affect the overall performance of the portfolio, especially before the markets show clear signs of a restart.\n\nUntil next time and happy 2023 to all!"
