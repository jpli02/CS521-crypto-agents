        "title": "FEG Token Migration, Trading Paused Due to Suspected Exploit; $FEG Plunges - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "BNB\n\nA flaw in the FEG Token Migration Tool leads to an exploit resulting in the extraction of FEGbcs liquidity.\n\nExploit Mars Smart DeFi Launch\n\nA suspected hacker has crashed the coming out party for the FEG Token project\u2019s Smart DeFi 2.0 upgrade. All migration and trading activity of $FEG on both Ethereum and BNB Chain was halted Thursday after developers noticed a massive extraction of liquidity on the token\u2019s BNB side.\n\nIn the FEG Telegram group, developer BalGu apologized for the flaw in the Migration Tool and shared information from investigations into the incident in conjunction with PeckShield.\n\n\u201cThe previous FEG LP pool from the exploit on FEGex was unbalanced,\u201d BalGu said. \u201cThe exploiter added liquidity to the old FEG pair and received LP tokens, giving the exploiter 100x leverage to exploit the pair and get 100x more out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a side note we are not leaving the project and are looking for solutions.\u201d\n\nComments in the Telegram group have been locked.\n\nAccording to the latest message in the group, \u201cThe FEG Team has been working on potential strategies moving forward, researching the wallets involved in the exploit, and offering a 10% bounty & white-hat label for the return of the LP ... We will continue to explore options for recovery for the FEGbsc liquidity that are well thought out.\u201d\n\nBefore trading was halted, CoinGecko showed an instantaneous drop of more than 50% in the price of $FEG on BNB and 24% on Ethereum.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time FEG has been hit by hacks. In May 2022, the project endured two flash loan attacks that caused losses of nearly $2 million. The team eventually recovered 90% of the funds, causing $FEG to rebound starting in late October.\n\nThis newest exploit is a serious setback for FEG in a pivotal moment that has been in the workings for months, including a complete project rebrand.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat is FEG Token:\n\nFEG Token is a decentralized transaction protocol on Ethereum and BNB Chain. FEG was created by FEGrox, the project\u2019s pseudonymous lead developer. The native FEG token is a hyper-deflationary, community-driven governance token with a 2% transaction tax. FEG offers an entire ecosystem built with a focus on reshaping and evolving how decentralized finance works. It includes a FEG Exchange for swapping, staking, and providing liquidity to tokens, as well as fWraps, which enable users to wrap another cryptocurrency like ADA, DOGE, or XRP and receive rewards.\n\nWhere to find FEG:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Medium | Whitepaper | Instagram | Telegram | Reddit | Discord | Youtube |"

        "content": "Binance\u2019s push into South Korea got called out by regulators in the country.\n\nBinance Pay pushed into France while BNB attempted to fight off sell pressure.\n\nAccording to South Korean news outlet Chosun, Binance [BNB] acquired a 50% stake in Gopax, a native crypto exchange, on 23 February. This is part of Binance\u2019s strategy to gain a foothold into South Korea. In addition, Leon Gong, the former Asian Pacific representative of Binance recently took over as Gopax\u2019s new CEO.\n\nAccording to the Chosun Ilbo, after Binance acquired the South Korean exchange Gopax, regulators may require it to reapply for virtual asset operator certification; banks are considering whether to continue to provide accounts. But it could also be attacking information being\u2026 https://t.co/Xcgl3LwhA1 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 23, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BNB Profit Calculator\n\nDespite these calculated moves, South Korean financial authorities have expressed concerns about Binance taking over. Allegedly, the move will pave the way for money laundering and financial crimes through unverified coins that are listed on the exchange. They said:\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to properly manage and supervise if the finance starts operating the exchange in the country. There is also the possibility of local outflows through the distribution of several unverified overseas listed coins.\u201d\n\nBinance faces regulation\n\nThe publication also revealed that South Korean financial authorities have reviewed alternative regulatory measures for Gopax after changes caused by Binance\u2019s involvement. This hiccup might be a major hurdle for Binance, but it will have to conform to the regulatory requirements to maintain operations in the country.\n\nSouth Korea is rapidly becoming one of the most attracting Asian jurisdictions for crypto startups and companies. But despite the challenges in the South Korean market, Binance is making headway elsewhere. The exchange recently announced the launch of Binance Pay in France through a collaboration with global payments provider, Ingenico.\n\nCrypto payments just got easier in France ??

Another milestone for global crypto adoption ? pic.twitter.com/S8f8Pab7nW \u2014 Binance (@binance) February 22, 2023\n\nHow did BNB react?\n\nBNB struggled to bypass this week\u2019s resistance at the $317 price range. On the other hand, existing sell pressure has also been limited, and this has allowed the price to stay above the $300 price range. BNB\u2019s mean coin age metric has continued to go up despite the price outcome, confirming that most investors were holding on to their coins at press time.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s BNB market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nBNB\u2019s MVRV ratio also confirmed that most of the buyers are in profit. Its volume has gradually dropped in the last two days, confirming that investors were still waiting on the sidelines for more directional clarity.\n\nThe market cap has declined gradually since mid-February, confirming that there have been significant liquidity outflows. However, the market cap did show some support at the $48.13 billion range."
