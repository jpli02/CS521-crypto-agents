        "content": "Listen to this article Listen to this article\n\nA popular bed and breakfast in downtown Columbia has reopened under new ownership.\n\nThe Chesnut Cottage Bed and Breakfast held an official grand opening on Thursday, June 29.\n\nNew owner Christal Doyle and her husband moved to South Carolina from California to open the bed and breakfast in the historic Chesnut Cottage at 1718 Hampton Street.\n\nThe Doyles originally discovered the cottage a few years ago when they visited Columbia to see historic sites, Christal Doyle told SC Biz News. They were so impressed by the home that when they found out the cottage\u2019s long-time previous owner Mary Sparrow was putting it up for sale, they decided to purchase it and continue with the popular bed and breakfast business Sparrow had built.\n\nBuilt around 1850, the house was the home of author Mary Boykin Chesnut and her husband General James Chesnut during the Civil War. The site is on the National Historic Registry and many of its original features have been preserved over the years. Rooms are furnished with period-appropriate historic furnishings.\n\nChesnut Cottage currently has five rooms open for guests and will eventually expand to seven. Curated breakfasts are offered and Doyle said there are plans to add a teahouse with traditional high tea to the property later in the year."

        "content": "SAN ANTONIO - According to new data released, Airbnb listings in San Antonio have seen a decrease in revenue over the last year. and show different percentages, but realty experts say this could mean good news for long-term house rentals.\n\n\u201cThere is a shortage of rentals right now, so them actually convert from Air B N B back to a standard rental would actually alleviate the stress,\u201d said Spencer Skubik, a realtor for Clark Realty.\n\nSkubik said with the decline in Airbnb revenue, property owners would be more likely to turn to long-term rentals rather than selling the home due to the current economic climate.\n\n\u201cWe do have inventory on the market but with these interest rates it\u2019s making it a lot more difficult for the first-time home buyers,\u201d said Skubik.\n\nJequell Johnson said this could help him tremendously as he\u2019s been looking to rent a home.\n\n\u201cFor bigger space, backyard, more rooms really so just bigger space,\u201d explained Johnson.\n\nJohnson said he\u2019s been looking to rent a home for a little over two years, but the rental shortage was hiking up prices out of his budget.\n\n\u201cThe renting prices for houses versus apartments was significantly bigger difference and houses being more pricey per month versus renting apartment at the time,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nJohnson said in the last few months he has seen a larger selection which he\u2019s not used to.\n\n\u201cI've also seen more houses listed in shorter amount of time, which is weird as well,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nJohnson said he\u2019s also seen those prices dropping and has finally secured a rental property at what he considers a reasonable price. He will be moving there next month. He said whatever factors have played a role, he\u2019s thankful that he will finally be able to give his dog a backyard.\n\n\u201cJust feel like it gives you more of opportunity to actually get into a home even though you don't have to buy it necessarily just to see what it will be like before you do get into the buying process,\u201d said Johnson."

        "title": "An Airbnb collapse won't fix America's housing shortage - Vox.com",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox and has been focusing her reporting on the future of work. She has covered business and technology for more than a decade \u2014 often in charts \u2014 including at Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe US housing market is scary right now, and Americans seem to be scrambling for signs that help is on the way.\n\nThis week a viral tweet said Airbnb host revenue had fallen off a cliff. But what\u2019s perhaps more interesting than a potentially misleading tweet is the response it got. Many suggested the revenue shortfall would mean more houses would come on the market and help reverse soaring housing prices, which have become unaffordable for many Americans. But like private equity investment in rental homes, short-term rentals like Airbnbs only play a small part in what\u2019s a much bigger problem.\n\nFirst of all, both Airbnb and another dataset contradict the findings in the viral tweet. An Airbnb spokesperson said, \u201cThe data is not consistent with our own data,\u201d adding that their last financial report showed more people traveling on Airbnb than ever before. And AirDNA, which scrapes Airbnb data and also has direct data from about a million short-term rental properties, said revenue per listing was down a modest 3 percent, following a bumper year. Vox also reached out to AllTheRooms, whose data is cited in the tweet, to ask if the tweet did in fact represent their data and how they got it, but didn\u2019t receive a response in time for publication.\n\nThe bigger takeaway from all this is simply that even a complete collapse of Airbnb\u2019s business would not fix America\u2019s housing market. There are lots of things contributing to out-of-control housing prices in the US, and short-term rentals are only just one tiny part.\n\nEven after a slight decline from a year ago, home prices are near their most unaffordable on record, with annual payments for a median home representing 41 percent of the median income, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Meanwhile, the Mortgage Bankers Association found that home buying has never been so unaffordable. That\u2019s all thanks to near-record housing prices combined with mortgage rates not seen in more than a decade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a one-two punch of needing to pay a high purchase price and finance it with this very expensive debt,\u201d Zillow senior economist Jeff Tucker told Vox.\n\nInterest rates aside, the fundamental reasons for the high prices of houses have to do with a lack of housing supply.\n\nSince the Great Recession, home builders haven\u2019t been building enough new homes to keep up with the growing population and the generation of millennials who reached their 30s and are starting families. New home construction had finally been ramping up in the last few years but has experienced a number of setbacks, including the pandemic, supply chain issues, and now \u2014 like the home buyers they\u2019re trying to furnish \u2014 high costs to borrow money.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t, in a single year, change the housing stock all that much. It\u2019s this long accumulative process,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cWe accumulated this deficit acutely over about 10 years, say from 2008 to 2018, and so it would take several years of the builders firing on all cylinders to offset that.\u201d\n\nAnother big issue hampering supply is the fact that homeowners are not putting their houses on the market. Zillow data shows that the inventory of existing homes for sale is about 50 percent less than it was pre-pandemic. New listings are down significantly this year.\n\nThat decline could be explained by the same reasons that are pricing everyone else out: housing prices and mortgage rates. Even if the price of their homes has appreciated a lot, so has the price of every other home. Current homeowners also don\u2019t want to trade their low mortgage rates for the current, much higher ones by buying a new house.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a larger number of existing mortgage holders with record-low interest rates. So if you have a mortgage with an interest rate in threes or low fours, you\u2019re less inclined to take on mortgages with rates in the sixes today,\u201d Alexander Hermann, a research associate at Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies, which recently released a report on the state of the nation\u2019s housing, said.\n\nHousing prices have also been driven by demand. During the pandemic, many people decided they no longer wanted to live with roommates and needed more space since many were working remotely. That helped usher in a rush of new household formations, according to a recent report by the Economic Innovation Group.\n\nAnd scapegoating short-term rentals isn\u2019t the answer.\n\n\u201cIn the vast majority of places, something like short-term rentals is not going to drive supply challenges,\u201d Hermann said. \u201cThey could exacerbate them.\u201d\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, there were 144 million housing units in the US compared with 1.2 million available short-term rentals like Airbnbs, according to AirDNA analysis of Census data. That means they make up just 0.8 percent of the housing stock, what Jamie Lane, AirDNA\u2019s chief economist and SVP of analytics, calls a \u201crounding error.\u201d\n\nIn a survey of recent studies on short-term rentals\u2019 effects on housing prices, AirDNA estimates that short-term rentals were responsible for 1 to 4 percent of the increase in housing prices.\n\nAnd even if people\u2019s revenue from their Airbnbs were to decline, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019d all of a sudden sell those properties, driving down home prices.\n\n\u201cPeople are still going to have their second homes \u2014 they\u2019re not getting rid of them,\u201d Lane said. \u201cLet\u2019s say there\u2019s their ski house in Breckenridge but now instead of only using it four weeks out of the year, they\u2019re putting it into the short-term rental inventory those other 48 weeks.\u201d\n\nWhat could meaningfully increase the housing supply and stop the growth in housing prices?\n\n\u201cWhat you fundamentally need is more new construction,\u201d Hermann said. \u201cHow you get that is probably a combination of things.\u201d That includes lowering interest rates, reining in the cost of construction supplies, and addressing labor shortages. More liberal zoning \u2014 allowing people to build more accessory dwelling units or on smaller parcels of land \u2014 would also help.\n\nBut an Airbnb collapse and the downfall of the short-term rental market? That isn\u2019t going to fix the housing shortage any time soon."

        "title": "Binance's ever-shrinking European footprint loses EUR payment rail - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Binance\u2019s European footprint keeps right on shrinking while what\u2019s left of the digital asset exchange\u2019s European-facing business is losing its primary fiat payment rail.\n\nOn June 29, German fintech media outlet Finance Forward reported that Germany\u2019s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) had decided against issuing Binance a license to custody digital currencies on behalf of German customers. The outlet\u2019s sources said this decision had been communicated to Binance\u2019s local representatives.\n\nBafin has neither confirmed nor denied the report, and Finance Forward cautioned that it was as yet unclear whether this was a final \u2018no\u2019 or whether Bafin had given Binance instructions on how it might bring its operations into compliance. Binance claims discussions remain ongoing.\n\nIn the meantime, while Binance can continue to operate within Germany, its lack of a local license means it can\u2019t market its wares directly to German consumers. Without a Bafin license, Binance will struggle to grow its German-facing operations. Then again, it\u2019s not like Binance hasn\u2019t historically found ways to circumvent rules it doesn\u2019t like, so we probably haven\u2019t heard the last on this score.\n\nBafin has of late been taking a tougher stance against \u2018crypto\u2019 scofflaws, including public spankings meted out to the likes of Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), Crypto.com, and Rtcoin. But Germany isn\u2019t the only German-speaking market to have grown weary of Binance\u2019s machinations.\n\nEarlier this week, Finance Forward reported that Binance\u2019s Austrian offshoot Binance Austria GmbH had withdrawn its application for a virtual asset service provider license from the country\u2019s Financial Market Authority (FMA). The report said the application was withdrawn \u201csome time ago,\u201d but the FMA declined public comment.\n\nOnly a year ago, Binance launched its Austria-facing exchange, but the FMA was reportedly unamused by Binance\u2019s willingness to jump the regulatory gun. The FMA is said to have \u201cexerted pressure\u201d on Binance to come into compliance, and the withdrawn application is apparently how Binance chose to respond.\n\nBinance\u2019s German-language push was further hampered by the rapid departures of several senior European executives, including Martin Bruncko, Lynn McConnell, Mike Ringer, Doron Rozenberg, Daniel Trinder, Michael Wild, and Raphael Zakarias.\n\nIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess whether these execs chose to jump or were pushed, but the ongoing drumbeat of negative press surrounding Binance likely convinced at least some of them that this was an item they\u2019d prefer to leave off their LinkedIn profiles.\n\nShrinking like Costanza in the pool\n\nIn response to the Finance Forward reports, Binance issued a typically meaningless statement about how it loves complying with regulations so much it wishes it could marry regulations. Binance also claims that it\u2019s taking all the necessary steps to ensure it\u2019s prepared to fully ignore the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) once it takes effect next year.\n\nMiCA will allow licensed crypto asset service providers (CASPs) to operate across the EU provided they adhere to a few simple rules, including establishing a registered office in an EU member state where actual business is conducted (so none of Binance\u2019s \u2018mailboxes posing as regional headquarters\u2019 shenanigans).\n\nBinance appears to be banking on securing a CASP designation in just one EU market from which it can serve the entire continent. The exchange has secured local licenses in several EU markets, including France, Italy, and Spain. Still, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how long it will be able to retain any of those licenses.\n\nFor instance, France recently opened a probe of Binance\u2019s local offshoot over suspected \u201caggravated money laundering\u201d and other illegal activities. Earlier this month, Binance was hounded out of the Netherlands and withdrew its application for a CASP license in Cyprus. And things could soon get much, much worse.\n\nThis week, Protos reported that EU authorities were investigating whether Binance used companies registered in Ireland and Malta to obfuscate revenue generated in other jurisdictions. (CZ resigned as director of two Ireland-based Binance units earlier this year.)\n\nBinance is suspected of inflating employee headcounts at these companies, which lack physical workspaces. The sums flowing through these entities are lumped into vague catch-all categories such as \u2018consultancy services.\u2019\n\nBinance\u2019s rationale for muddying these financial waters is unclear. However, the fact that the exchange\u2019s customers often boast zero degrees of separation from illegal activity suggests various tantalizing possibilities.\n\nEURout of luck\n\nMeanwhile, Paysafe Payment Solutions, the U.K.-based company that provides Binance with EUR-based fiat rails, has decided to cut ties with the exchange. This week, Binance sent its customers an email informing them that Paysafe would officially halt EUR deposits and withdrawals as of September 25, leaving the exchange on the hunt (yet again) for a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) partner.\n\nIn May, Paysafe\u2019s payment subsidiary Skrill cut off Binance\u2019s ability to deposit or withdraw in U.K. pounds. In announcing this step, Paysafe called it a \u201cprudent decision\u201d given the \u201ctoo challenging\u201d regulatory environment in the U.K. The U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) previously characterized Binance as \u201cnot capable of being effectively supervised.\u201d\n\nWith a growing number of financial institutions realizing that the risks of dealing with Binance vastly outweigh the benefits, not to mention the growing number of regulatory proceedings underway on several continents\u2014and U.S. criminal charges against Binance and founder Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao expected any day now\u2014Binance will be forced to engage in ever more unsavory methods of moving money on and off its platform. We\u2019re sure that will work out just fine.\n\nExecutive misdirection\n\nBinance\u2019s brain trust has started to realize that CZ\u2019s personal brand has become so toxic that the only way the exchange will survive the next few years will be for its founder to exit. The circumstances of that exit could involve anything from self-imposed exile to prison time, but so long as CZ\u2019s at the helm, Binance will remain a regulatory pariah.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why Binance has suddenly begun elevating senior figures\u2019 public profiles. Like Richard Teng, the former Singapore central banker who joined Binance in 2021 and last month was named head of its regional markets outside America. Bloomberg later reported that Binance appeared to be positioning Teng to assume the CEO role should CZ find it advisable or necessary to step aside.\n\nClearly, this is a message that Binance wishes to communicate to the world. Yi He, Binance\u2019s female co-founder and significant shareholder, recently told Bloomberg that both she and CZ have unidentified \u2018backup executives in training\u2019 in case either one or both of them were no longer around.\n\nWhile Yi He doesn\u2019t do much press, her interest in digital assets predates CZ\u2019s, as she was also co-founder of the OKCoin exchange. In 2014, she hired CZ as the exchange\u2019s CTO. He later returned the favor by bringing her on as a consultant as Binance was getting off the ground in 2017.\n\n(Interestingly, OKCoin was where CZ first deployed his talents for artificially boosting the value of certain tokens at certain times. Fast forward to today, where Binance is a wash trading machine, and you can see that Yi He has a lot to answer for.)\n\nYi He and CZ have been romantically linked and have children together, although their current status remains unclear. But Yi He bristled when Bloomberg tried to draw a parallel with the romantic ties of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. \u201cCaroline was an employee, whereas I am a partner.\u201d\n\nYi He largely deflected Bloomberg\u2019s questions regarding Binance\u2019s U.S. legal problems, which isn\u2019t surprising, given that her name appeared in a translation of an internal Binance audio recording that was published as part of the Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s civil suit against Binance and CZ.\n\nIn that 2019 recording, CZ is quoted saying Yi He \u201cis right\u201d in recommending ways for Binance to secretly retain its U.S. VIP customers despite Binance\u2019s public claims to have purged all U.S.-based customers from its dot-com site.\n\nEqually troubling is Yi He\u2019s role as the head of the Binance Labs venture capital group as well as leading the team that decides what tokens get listed on the exchange. The inherent conflicts in this dual role are obvious, at least to anyone not working for Binance.\n\nYi He\u2019s on-the-record comments re Binance\u2019s regulatory approach were the standard \u2018we love compliance\u2019 Binance nonsense, but she did get off one money quote that didn\u2019t quite land the way she seems to think it did:\n\n\u201cIf [regulators] really took the time to understand our industry, they would see that if Binance isn\u2019t compliant, then practically no other global trading platform or offshore company is.\u201d\n\nUm, yeah, that\u2019s kinda the point that regulators have been trying to get across. Binance was by no means the first criminal \u2018crypto\u2019 exchange, but its reckless disregard for the rules earned Binance a dominant market share, becoming the model that other exchanges follow to try to replicate its success.\n\nBinance\u2019s relentless championing of function-free unregistered securities suitable only for speculation also helped confuse consumers as to the reason Bitcoin (which endures under the BSV ticker symbol) was created in the first place. In short, Binance has a lot of crimes to answer for, and it will take more than a cosmetic leadership switcheroo to put that toothpaste back in the tube.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple, Ethereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?
