        "content": "When traveling with horses, you may be tempted to stay in your trailer or find separate stalls and hotel rooms; but many Horse Airbnbs offer horse boarding!

We at Cowboy Lifestyle Network have compiled a list of 10 of our favorite horse-friendly Airbnbs.\n\nFarm Cottage \u2013 Anthony, Florida\n\nThis cottage is located on the 22-acre Red Sky Ranch next to an 8-stall horse barn and 4 paddocks; and it includes stall shavings, the wash bay, jump fields, the tack room, and more.
