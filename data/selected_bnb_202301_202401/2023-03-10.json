        "content": "Credit: Belga / James Gekiere\n\nBelgium's GDP growth is expected to \"accelerate further\" over the first quarter of this year, as falling energy prices and government-mandated wage indexations ease fears about the state of the Belgian economy.\n\nAccording to the most recent economic forecast by the National Bank of Belgium (BNB), Belgium is on course for GDP growth of 0.4% in the first quarter of this year, up from 0.1% in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nIn the report (published on Thursday) Belgium's national bank states that the improved economic situation is primarily a result of the \"remarkably strong increase in personal consumption\". This was driven by wage indexations and falling energy prices. It also noted that the drop in energy prices \"somewhat eased\" inflationary pressures.\n\nHowever, the Bank was careful to emphasise that its forecasts may prove incorrect. It stressed the \"substantial uncertainty\" surrounding its predictions and added that \"the massive shocks since the start of the Covid-19 crisis\" \u2014 including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent European energy crisis \u2014 pose a challenge to economic forecasting.\n\nContrasting viewpoints\n\nDespite the expected uptick in Belgium's GDP, the country's long-term economic prospects are alarmingly bleak. The BNB's own annual report, published just last week, indicates that Belgium faces a serious risk of deindustrialisation due to energy prices which, though falling, remain remarkably high relative to other parts of the world.\n\nIn addition, the annual report noted that mortgage affordability in Belgium has fallen to \"historically low levels\" due to sharp increases in housing prices and mortgage rates. Concerningly, Belgium's budget deficit \u2014 one of the largest in the EU \u2014 was deemed \"worrisome and unsustainable\".\n\nRelated News\n\nThe report also found that Belgian leaders have largely failed to address fundamental structural economic challenges over the past few years. The country still lags behind with a low labour force participation rate and on the transition to a green economy.\n\n\"The employment rate is too low, the budget deficit is too high and greenhouse gas emissions are falling too slowly,\" BNB Governor Pierre Wunsch told De Tijd. \"In addition, a new challenge has been added: the decline in competitiveness.\""

        "title": "Proprietor moves SC in insurance claim case - Kuensel, Buhutan's National Newspaper",
        "content": "Case dates back to 2020\n\nNima Wangdi\n\nThe proprietor of Phuntsho Timber Industry, Phuntsho Wangdi, appealed to the Supreme Court unhappy with the High Court\u2019s verdict on his insurance claim after the HC denied the compensation he claimed, the conduct of the HC hearings and the manner in which the insurance company deducted money from his bank account.\n\nIn his appeal letter to the SC on March 6, the proprietor, Phuntsho Wangdi said that Bhutan Insurance Limited (BIL) did not pay the reduced insurance claim of Nu 195,000 even after five months. The proprietor had claimed Nu 266,890 in insurance after a windstorm blew away the roof of his industry in 2020.\n\nBIL assessed and reduced the claim to 195,000. After five months, BIL reduced it to 101,466. Phuntsho Wangdi who walked into Kuensel on Tuesday said that the courts are not doing anything to BIL for delaying and not releasing the payment. He had not received the reduced claims BIL worked on.\n\nNot receiving his claims, Phuntsho Wangdi did not renew his insurance scheme. \u201cHowever, BIL had renewed my insurance policy by debiting the premium amount of Nu 79,780 from my bank account without my knowledge and consent. The HC asked BIL to pay back just the premium without any investigation on the legitimacy,\u201d he said.\n\nPhuntsho Wangdi is claiming for the refund of the insurance premium with interest, which the HC denied. Phuntsho Wangdi claims that BIL has notified him about the claim reduction to Nu 101,466 and he accepted. After BIL did not pay him even after a month, he rejected the offer through an e-mail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhuntsho Wangdi said that he informed the court that he had already nullified the last claim amount after the company did not pay him and wanted to stick to the initial claim of Nu 195,000 to which he had agreed by signing the document. \u201cBut the court did not acknowledge it,\u201d he said.\n\nPhuntsho Wangdi also claimed that he was not given the opportunity to rebut BIL\u2019s submission which he said contained many false claims. \u201cThe court did not share with me the copy of BIL\u2019s submission nor was I called for the hearing that day.\u201d \u201cThe judgment shows that the court conducted four hearings out of which I was called for only two.\u201d\n\nHe submitted five requests to the SC \u2013 to review the case since BIL has submitted many claims to the HC without any evidence, considering the insurance claim of Nu 195,000, consider compensation claim of Nu 3,750,000, and the illegal deduction of insurance premium from his bank account.\n\nHe also requested the court to investigate the injustice and BIL for procrastinating and not paying the claim amount.\n\nPhuntsho Wangdi said Phuntsholing drungkhag and Chukha courts took more than one year each to pass judgments.\n\nGoing by the amount of claims, it is not even worth fighting a case. \u201cI am doing this because I am unhappy with the service BIL provided to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIL\u2019 stand\n\nIn an earlier email response to Kuensel, BIL officials said that they renewed the insurance policy as the proprietor had not renewed it. \u201cIt is as per the existing prudential regulations of Royal Monetary Authority (RMA). It is to ensure that fixed assets pledged as collateral or mortgaged against loans are properly insured,\u201d the email stated.\n\nThe email also stated that BIL signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the BNB stipulating a condition that in the event of the borrower\u2019s failure to insure or renew the insurance policy, BNB would insure or renew the insurance policy and debit the cost of the insurance to the borrower\u2019s loan account. \u201cBIL hasn\u2019t transferred the insurance premium unilaterally but done as per the prudential regulations and MoU signed with BNB.\u201d\n\nHowever, Phuntsho Wangdi said that he should have been informed at least after the premium was deducted and the scheme was renewed. \u201cBIL did not do that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said while the MoU mechanism between BIL and BNB is for a good cause, his case was different since the company had not released his claim."
