        "content": "A boutique bed and breakfast project in Helena is nearing completion, and its developer now has her sights set on a similar endeavor in Hoover.\n\nBuck Creek BNB is projected to open in May on Lake Davidson Lane, said real estate broker and developer Jordan Masaeid-Hosey, who heads the project. She is the broker for Housed by Hosey and CEO of Game On Bnb, a short-term rental company.\n\nThe 10,000-square foot Buck Creek BNB has eight units of individually-themed two and three-bedroom suites, with laundry, kitchen, living room and balcony with views of Buck Creek. There will also be an on-site hot tub spa, a deck overlooking the creek for communal use, and a special area for travelers with pets.\n\nIt also is adjacent to shopping and restaurants in Old Town Helena which offers visitors a \u201cHallmark feel,\u201d she said. Masaeid-Hosey said it will be the first lodging option for Helena since 1877.\n\nIn addition to Buck Creek, Masaeid-Hosey is planning Brock\u2019s Gap BNB in Hoover, at Mineral Trace and Stadium Trace Parkway, tentatively scheduled to open in 2025. This project will feature a different, more vertical design, with 17 suites to hold up to 10 people, a breakfast and spa open on the first floor, and a rooftop bar and pool overlooking the Hoover Met.\n\nThe concept has its roots in how travelers use the Internet to search for lodging.\n\nThe 10,000-square foot Buck Creek BNB has eight units of individually-themed two and three-bedroom suites. (Buck Creek BNB)\n\n\u201cAirbnb is its own brand,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who come to Helena or Hoover aren\u2019t Googling for hotels. For us to be able to continue to evolve with technology and the way it\u2019s being used, we don\u2019t want to be called a hotel or motel. We want to embrace the southern value that a bed and breakfast has to offer to people.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Hoover\u2019s city council prohibited rentals of homes in residential neighborhoods for less than 30 days, except for special events. Masaeid-Hosey, a Hoover High graduate and resident, was one who spoke in favor of allowing such rentals.\n\n\u201cWe listened,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what the people say they want, lodging in a commercial zone.\u201d\n\nThe Hoover project still has several planning and procedural steps to go, but she said the project will appeal to large, millennial groups coming to the city for events who aren\u2019t looking for large numbers of hotel rooms.\n\n\u201cHotels currently in the city do not serve those who have the desire to keep larger groups and families together,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you commute to Hoover for sports, entertainment, for galas, you don\u2019t have a place for those people who want to have a living room, kitchen, private bedrooms with a private door.\u201d\n\nBrock\u2019s Gap is looking for spa, dining and bar partners to craft an all-inclusive lodging destination.\n\n\u201cWe want to really create an overall experience for the traveler who is looking for something beyond the hotel standard bedroom setting,\u201d Madaeid-Hosey said. \u201cWe are looking to closely work with Hoover\u2019s planners and city council members, as well as the Trace Crossings members, to evolve something that fills a much-needed gap that we feel we can bridge for our community and travelers.\u201d"

        "title": "problems for the crypto Binance Coin (BNB) - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Binance Coin (BNB) is the crypto of Binance\n\nIt is also the native cryptocurrency of BNB Chain. The latter is a theoretically decentralized blockchain, although Binance\u2019s role in its operation is relevant.\n\nBNB is suffering in the crypto markets these days because of the problems with BUSD (Binance USD).\n\nCrypto: Binance Coin (BNB) and BUSD\n\nIn theory, there is no close relationship between BNB and BUSD, except for the fact that the fees one has to pay to send BUSD tokens via BSC have to be paid in BNB.\n\nThe greater relationship lies in the use of the name Binance, which is the brand name of the world\u2019s leading crypto exchange.\n\nIndeed, behind Binance USD, i.e., the BUSD stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is not the Binance exchange, but another issuer (Paxos) that uses the exchange\u2019s brand name because it has been granted the right to use it for this specific purpose.\n\nGiven the problems BUSD is having, Paxos has decided to discontinue its commercial relationship with Binance, and stop minting new BUSD tokens.\n\nHence in theory BNB is a different thing altogether, with different issuer (BSC), different value, different market, and different expectations. Despite this, Binance USD\u2019s problems are not spilling over into BUSD\u2019s market value, but seem to be weighing on BNB.\n\nBNB\u2019s decline\n\nYesterday, the price of BNB fell within about two hours from $315 to $289, and then fell again over the next nine hours to $284.\n\nThereafter, it recovered slightly, ending its descent and partially rising again to $292.\n\nWhereas the price of BUSD was essentially always around $1, since it is a fully collateralized stablecoin and redeemable at any time by Paxos at the fixed price of $1.\n\nAs long as Paxos continues to have no problem redeeming BUSD at the fixed price of $1, its market value will inevitably continue to fluctuate around this figure.\n\nIt may fall significantly below $1 only for short periods, and on isolated exchanges where arbitrage does not rush to meet any oversupply of selling. As soon as that excess ends, or as soon as arbitrage manages to meet all of the selling bid, its value returns to around $1.\n\nIt is only in the remote event that Paxos is no longer able to return $1 to anyone who in turn returns their BUSD tokens that its real market value could deviate from parity with the dollar in a consistent and definitive way.\n\nFor example, taking the BUSD/USD trading pair on Binance as a reference, it turns out that yesterday for a very brief moment the price of BUSD fell to $0.995, a deviation of only -0.5% from the reference value. Within an hour it had already risen to $0.999.\n\nTherefore, if the price of BUSD cannot realistically fluctuate much at this time, what fluctuates is the value of BNB.\n\nWhy is BUSD driving BNB down\n\nIt is possible that the main reason BUSD\u2019s problems have increased selling pressure on BNB is the shared Binance brand.\n\nAfter all, the Binance exchange actually seems to have nothing to do with the problems of Paxos, which is the issuer of BUSD. The thing is that the price of BUSD cannot go down, except for a very short time, even in case the selling pressure increases a lot, hence the fears spill over into the price of BNB.\n\nIt is worth noting that yesterday BUSD\u2019s market capitalization fell from $16.1 billion to $15.7 billion, despite the fact that the price has not significantly changed, because the increased selling pressure on stablecoins does not have the effect of driving down their price, but rather the number of tokens in circulation.\n\nHowever, there is also another much more important reason that caused BNB\u2019s decline.\n\nIndeed, many have interpreted the moves of the US authorities against BUSD as actually a direct attack on Binance itself.\n\nWhile from a strictly technical point of view it seems for all intents and purposes to be an attack against Paxos, it is suspected that the real ultimate target may be the exchange.\n\nAt this point, it is obvious that there is increased selling pressure on BNB, despite the fact that from a strictly technical point of view this would actually be BSC\u2019s native cryptocurrency. Behind both BSC and BNB is Binance itself, so an increase in fears about Binance inevitably leads to increased selling pressure on BNB.\n\nThe 2022 of the Binance Coin (BNB) crypto\n\nIt is worth noting that despite the recent decline, and the 2022 crash, BNB\u2019s current price is \u201conly\u201d 57% below its all-time high of $686 touched in May 2021.\n\nFor instance, Bitcoin is at -68%, and ETH at -69%.\n\nAnd yet Bitcoin has lost only 0.3% since yesterday, while BNB has lost 6.7%.\n\nThe point is that in 2022, BNB has lost less in percentage terms than BTC and ETH, perhaps partly due to the fact that in 2021 it did not have two peak highs but only one.\n\nBTC and ETH had a first peak between April and May 2021, and then a second one in November. In contrast, BNB stopped at the maximum peak in May, because the one in November was slightly lower.\n\nBut the big difference was made by the second part of 2022, that is, after the collapse in May and June due to the implosion of the Terra/Luna ecosystem and its consequences.\n\nThe facts\n\nAs a matter of fact, at the end of December 2022, the price of BNB was 25% higher than the annual lows in June, effectively making the bear market of 2022 a little less harsh for BNB holders.\n\nTherefore, despite yesterday\u2019s sharp decline, the price of BNB is actually still doing quite well compared to other major cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is also because Binance remains the undisputed leading exchange in this market, and its strength has not yet been affected in the slightest by the attacks of the US authorities.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the Binance.com exchange does not serve US customers, because for US customers there is Binance.us, a de facto exchange detached from the international one, although based on the same exchange platform.\n\nBinance and BNB continue to be very strong, despite all the problems they are going through, perhaps precisely because they have shown so far that they are able to deal with and solve them all.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that since its inception in 2017, the exchange has already had to face and solve numerous problems, including legal ones, and so far it has always shown itself to be able to come out on top.\n\nIn other words, using a term that has been very fashionable lately, it has demonstrated concretely that it is very resilient, and this can only reflect positively on BNB\u2019s price in the medium to long term."
