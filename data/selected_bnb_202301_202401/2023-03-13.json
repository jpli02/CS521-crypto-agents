        "content": "Back in November, after the collapse of FTX, the exchange\u2019s rival, Binance decided to roll out the Industry Recovery Initiative. The initiative planned to provide aid to cryptocurrency projects that were enduring a liquidity crisis post the FTX crash. This fund continues to entail $1 billion worth of Binance USD Coin [BUSD]. More recently, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of the exchange announced that these funds would be converted to Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Binance Coin [BNB].\n\nCZ announced on Twitter and suggested that the recovery initiative funds will now be changed to BTC, ETH & BNB.\n\nThis did not come as a surprise considering the U.S. government\u2019s recent scrutiny pertaining to BUSD. Now, that Binance intends to limit the use of BUSD, the focus undoubtedly shifts to assets like BTC, ETH, BNB, and others.\n\nAdditionally, CZ also attributed this move to the changes in stablecoins and banks that have currently been taking place. The Binance CEO further wrote,\n\n\u201cGiven the changes in stable coins and banks, #Binance will convert the remaining of the $1 billion Industry Recovery Initiative funds from BUSD to native crypto, including #BTC, #BNB and ETH. Some fund movements will occur on-chain. Transparency.\u201d\n\nBTC, ETH & BNB continue to soar amidst SVB collapse\n\nBitcoin slumped below $20K last week, for the first time since mid-January. However, the king coin recovered in no time and its counterparts followed suit. At press time, Bitcoin was trading for $22,422 with an 8.48% daily surge.\n\nEthereum with a 7.72% increase over the last 24 hours was priced at $1,601. Untethered by the BUSD drama, Binance Coin rose by 7.19% and was trading for $301.31.\n\nSeveral in the community came forward and lauded CZ for his \u201cbullish\u201d move. A few others noted how there was $1 billion buying pressure on BTC, ETH & BNB."

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of March 13 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has had a tumultuous few days; Bitcoin and other digital assets took a tumble before recovering late in the week to recoup some of their losses.\n\nThree U.S. bank shutdowns in recent days, SVB Financial Group\u2019s Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Silvergate Capital Corp., and Signature Bank, have triggered more stress that's also affected the crypto arena, specifically stablecoins. Despite this uncertain period, some crypto assets have managed to beat the average performance trend.\n\nThis week, we examine Kava (KAVA), UNUS SED LEO (LEO), Aptos (APT), BNB (BNB), and Pax Gold (PAXG). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Kava (KAVA)'s price jumped 30% shortly after it launched new validator incentives.\n\nUNUS SED LEO (LEO) posted a 15% increase in price, likely because of multiple new token listings.\n\nAptos (APT) rose by more than 10%, perhaps due to the launch of an nonfungible token (NFT) bridge on blockchain message protocol Wormhole.\n\nThe market cap of BNB (BNB) went up by about 5%, possibly because of a recent fund conversion by Binance.\n\nThe market capitalization of PAX Gold (PAXG) increased by about 5% as investors turn to tokenized assets, which mirror the value of a particular underlying asset.\n\n\n\nKava (KAVA)\n\nThe price of KAVA, the token of Kava, a Web3-focused crypto project, surged about 30%, likely because of newly launched validator incentives. This program gives incentives for becoming a validator\u2014an entity responsible for verifying transactions on a blockchain\u2014on the Akash Network.\n\nThe price rise followed news that the creators of Akash pledged 2.5 million AKT, that project's native token, to Kava\u2019s Strategic Vault. KAVA started last week at about 78 cents and is now priced at around $1 (see chart below).\n\n\n\nKAVA price: TradingView\n\nUNUS SED LEO (LEO)\n\nBitfinex\u2019s UNUS SED LEO token experienced an increase of about 15% amid news that multiple new tokens have been listed on Bitfinex. Last week, LEO was valued at $3.35 and is now hovering at around $3.45 (see chart below).\n\n\n\nLEO price: TradingView\n\nAptos (APT)\n\nThe Aptos (APT) project's token price advanced by more than 10% after the launch of an NFT bridge on decentralized, universal blockchain message protocol Wormhole that allows users to transfer NFTs between Aptos Network and other supported chains around the same time as the introduction of Primary Names on Aptos. Primary Names are website address extensions that end in .apt.\n\nOne more reason could be a report from crypto analytics firm Messari saying that Aptos had the fastest time to finality (TTF). This metric determines how long it takes for a transaction to be considered final on a blockchain. Aptos and Avalanche are TTF winners among live blockchains, according to Messari. APT was valued at $11.14 last week and now stands at around $11.65 (see chart below).\n\nAPT price: TradingView\n\nBNB (BNB)\n\nBNB's market cap increased by more than 5% last week, to $47.5 billion from $44.9 billion. The gain came as crypto exchange Binance's CEO. Changpeng Zhao. said his exchange had converted the remainder of its $1 billion Industry Recovery Initiative funds to other assets, including BNB, BTC, and ETH. In late 2022, Binance said it would commit $1 billion to start the initiative to invest in digital asset companies.\n\nBNB was priced at $286 seven days ago and is now valued at around $297.70 (see chart below).\n\n\n\nBNB price: TradingView\n\nPAX Gold (PAXG)\n\nThe market cap of PAX Gold (PAXG) increased by more than 5%, to $526 million from $500.7 million in the latest week. The token is asset-backed, meaning one token represents one fine troy ounce of a London Good Delivery gold bar.\n\nOne possible reason for the market cap increase could be that investors are turning to more traditional assets (even though tokenized) at a time when global markets are uncertain. PAXG started last week at $1,851 and is now priced at around $1,938 (see chart below).\n\n\n\nPAXG price: TradingView\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "Binance Coin (BNB): Crypto Latest News - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Latest crypto updates regarding Binance Coin (BNB), the cryptocurrency that powers the BNB Chain ecosystem. According to an analysis of its latest performance, can it be said that BNB is immune to the crisis triggered by Silvergate?\n\nRecall that as one of the most popular utility tokens in the world, not only can you trade in BNB as you would with any other crypto, but you can also use BNB for a wide range of applications and benefits.\n\nPredictions regarding the price of crypto Binance Coin (BNB)\n\nAccording to TradingView, BNB was trading at about $279.3 at press time, with a market capitalization of $43.1 billion. On the weekly front, in fact, it was down more than 5 percent in the rankings.\n\nAnd as the numbers slowly increase, investors and experts have become bullish on the token. Digital Capital Management CEO Ben Ritchie is positive on BNB and predicts that by the end of the year the cryptocurrency will be worth $300.\n\nRitchie also admitted that the viability of the Binance exchange will determine the fate of BNB. In fact, going on to say that the business has the potential to be deflationary, he added:\n\n\u201cThe price of BNB also follows supply and demand. BNB introduced a burn mechanism in each transaction fee and conducted quarterly burns, making it a deflationary asset. As the ecosystem of the BNB chain continues to grow, the price could reach $3,000 in 2030.\u201c\n\nCurrently, the price of Binance Coin is below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Since January 20, 2022, the 200-day SMA indicates selling for the previous 212 days.\n\nSince July 16, 2022, when the price of Binance Coin fell below the 50-day SMA, this indicator has indicated a sell signal for the past 55 days.\n\nBinance Coin crypto news: we2net (WE2NET) protocol goes live on BNB Chain\n\nwe2net (WE2NET) is a new liquidity protocol and reward generation system that aims to provide a more equitable, inclusive, and balanced liquidity ecosystem. The protocol has a rigorous third-party security audit and a detailed roadmap for 2023-2024.\n\nAccording to the official announcement of the we2net team, its mainnet version is only a little closer to its official public release. The first generation of its liquidity providers should be entered until April 15, 2023.\n\nThis protocol focuses on providing equal opportunities for early enthusiasts, founding teams and other investors by locking a portion of the liquidity into the smart contract for a predetermined period.\n\nThe injected liquidity will be stored in the PancakeSwap (CAKE) pool to prevent the network from being dominated by whales. It will also eliminate the opportunity for early contributors to sell their large-scale allocation in the first months of we2net\u2019s operation.\n\nThe utility and LP reward token for the protocol, called WE2NET, will be distributed to all investors. 1 WE2NET is currently sold for 0.1 USDT. The first LP reward distribution will occur after the LP expires in April 2023.\n\nTo accelerate adoption of we2net and increase visibility, the team has launched a generous referral program. Direct referrals can earn up to 50 percent of the reward for their followers.\n\nThe referral program has six levels: direct referrers get 50%, indirect referrers get 25%, third-level referrers get 12.5%, and so on. To ensure that its design is secure for all users and liquidity providers, the we2net protocol has been verified by CertiK, one of Web3\u2019s leading cybersecurity teams.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB): a bit of history\n\nInitially, Binance Coin was an ERC-20 token developed on the Ethereum blockchain. It was designed as a reward mechanism for those who helped bring Binance to the public and also empowered users to reduce trading fees.\n\nHowever, in 2019, Binance launched its own blockchain, known as the Binance Chain. This new blockchain is smart contract enabled and powered by BNB, its native token.\n\nOwning BNB on Binance Chain grants users access to exclusive token sales and reduced trading costs. It can also be used as a community token for dApps on the Binance Chain.\n\nThe launch of the Binance Chain also marked a significant change for Binance Coin, as all BNB holders had to participate in a token exchange to exchange their BNB ERC-20 tokens for new Binance Chain BNB tokens.\n\nOver the past year, the price of BNB has experienced some significant fluctuations. In late 2020, BNB experienced a significant upward run, reaching an all-time high of nearly $40 in December of that year.\n\nIn 2021, Binance and its blockchain network gained popularity, driving up the value of BNB. Since then, Binance Chain has become BNB\u2019s native blockchain, and Binance.US has adopted BNB as its official cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of the reasons behind BNB\u2019s relatively strong performance over the years has been its solid fundamentals. BNB is also supported by a number of high-profile partnerships and collaborations, which enhance its credibility and attractiveness."
