        "content": "Key Points\n\n* Binance successfully completes BNB Smart Chain (BEP20) network upgrade and hard fork.\n\n* Deposits and withdrawals were temporarily suspended from approximately 07:15 am UTC and have now resumed.\n\n* The announcement was made on August 30, 2023, at 11:14 AM, and garnered significant attention on social media.\n\nBinance, a global leader in digital asset exchanges, announced today the successful completion of a critical upgrade and hard fork for its BNB Smart Chain (BEP20). The upgrade, which temporarily halted deposits and withdrawals, has now been successfully implemented, and all services have resumed as of 11:14 AM on August 30, 2023.\n\nThe Upgrade: A Focused Look\n\nThe upgrade was initially announced on August 28, 2023, and was scheduled for today. Deposits and withdrawals on the BEP20 network were suspended from approximately 07:15 am UTC. A reminder was issued an hour before the upgrade commenced, stating that all deposits and withdrawals would be temporarily suspended until the network was deemed stable. Finally, Binance confirmed the completion of the upgrade, stating, \"Binance has completed the BNB Smart Chain (BEP20) network upgrade and hard fork, with deposits and withdrawals back online.\"\n\nUser Impact and Market Response\n\nWhile Binance thanked its users for their patience, it also apologized for any inconvenience caused during the upgrade. The temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals was a necessary step to ensure the successful implementation of the network changes.\n\nBroader Context: BNB Chain's Future Plans\n\nIn a recent interview, Binance revealed ambitious plans for its BNB Smart Chain, aiming to lay the groundwork for the next 1 billion Web3 users. The chain is focusing on performance and scalability improvements, including the implementation of layer 2 solutions like opBNB, which can handle around 4K TPS and offers a 90% reduction in gas fees at $0.005.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe completion of the BNB Smart Chain upgrade and hard fork marks a pivotal moment for both Binance and its community of users. Although the immediate market ramifications remain unclear, the reinstatement of deposit and withdrawal functions signals a return to normalcy for the platform's operations.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock\n\n. . .\n\nTags"

        "content": "BNB\n\nBinance's official statement communicates that the phasing out of BUSD support will occur gradually, and the transition will be completed by February 2024, coinciding with Paxos Trust Company's acquisition of BUSD.\n\nTransitioning Away from BUSD\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced its decision to discontinue support for its stablecoin, BUSD, by 2024. This monumental step comes after tumultuous legal battles amidst shifting regulatory landscapes.\n\nBinance, through its app, informs users that support for the BUSD stablecoin will be gradually phased out.\n\nSource: Binance App\n\nThe process is set to unfold until Paxos, the United States-based blockchain infrastructure platform, completes its acquisition of BUSD by February 2024. This acquisition is anticipated to shape the direction of BUSD's journey, raising curiosity about the outcome.\n\nDespite ranking among the top five stablecoins with a market capitalization exceeding $3.1 billion, BUSD has faced scrutiny from the US regulators.\n\nEarlier this year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took legal action against Paxos Trust Company for issuing BUSD without proper registration, labeling it an unregistered security. This legal confrontation led Paxos to halt the issuance of new BUSD tokens starting from February 21, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the stablecoin's future.\n\n\u200d\n\nBUSD's Exit Spotlights Stablecoin Viability and Regulatory Compliance\n\nThe decision raises questions about the viability of stablecoins that face legal challenges and underscores the need for stronger compliance protocols across the industry. The acquisition of BUSD by Paxos Trust Company by February 2024 adds a layer of complexity. The way the transition is managed will determine whether it improves or worsens the situation.\n\nBinance has also recently announced the following spot trading pairs will cease trading on September 1, 2023: ANKR/BNB, CVC/BUSD, EPX/BUSD, HIVE/BUSD, IOTA/BNB, KLAY/BUSD, LRC/BNB, MBL/BUSD, MTL/ETH, UMA/BUSD.\n\nWhile phasing out support for its stablecoin BUSD, Binance is not slowing down its global expansion plans. The exchange is pushing ahead with its expansion plans, venturing into Latin America by launching a service that facilitates crypto-to-bank account payments."
