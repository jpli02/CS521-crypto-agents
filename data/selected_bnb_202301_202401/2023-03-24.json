Our original story follows.\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, has temporarily suspended all spot trading, deposits and withdrawals citing an \u201cissue\u201d that it\u2019s working to resolve.\n\n\u201cInitial analysis indicates matching engine encountered a bug on a trailing stop order (a weird one),\u201d Binance founder and chief executive Changpeng Zhao said in a tweet, adding that the firm expects things to recover within two hours.\n\nBinance commands over 60% of all crypto spot volume. It has also increased its market share of Bitcoin spot volume to over 90% in recent quarters, thanks to zero commissions, according to according to Arcane Research.\n\nBitcoin fell 1% to $27,649 and Ethereum fell 2% to $1,751 on the news before recovering slightly.\n\nEngine 1 is back online. Still need more time to do reconciliations, and for other engines to catch up. We were a bit unlucky with this bug. Our engines take hourly snapshots. This bug happened 57 min in.

        "content": "What crypto news is there for Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP) and Space ID (ID)? How are their prices performing? Below are all the answers.\n\nIn-depth analysis of the crypto assets Dogecoin, Ripple and the new Space ID\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Dogecoin is the crypto meme whose logo is graphically based on an internet meme representing a Shiba dog.\n\nRipple is a real-time funds transfer system, a network for currency exchanges and remittance sending, created in 2012 by Ripple Labs.\n\nFinally, Space ID (ID) is the new token launched on Binance\u2019s Launchpad.\n\nElon Musk raises the price of Dogecoin with a tweet\n\nIn a joking tweet, famous Dogecoin supporter and tech billionaire Elon Musk mentioned a \u201cfee to visit Twitter headquarters,\u201d which should be paid in DOGE.\n\nA user who asked to visit the headquarters of this social media platform received a response from Elon Musk, who ironically replied that it would cost 3 DOGE.\n\nHey Chief Twit @elonmusk I will be travelling to US next month to witness the Starship Launch. Would love to visit the bird app headquarters too. I spoke with someone from the team & they said, I need your permission to visit \ud83e\udee1 pic.twitter.com/AToGSxf4iG \u2014 DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) March 23, 2023\n\nThis may have renewed speculation among Dogecoin traders and investors that the cryptocurrency might eventually be recognized as a form of payment on Twitter.\n\nThe popular price of DOGE rose more than 3.3% to $0.077137 after Musk\u2019s post. In addition, because of his recent remarks on the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) plans, Musk has recently attracted media attention.\n\nIn fact, in a statement, Musk says that the shift from low-interest savings accounts to high-interest money market accounts is a significant factor in why depositors are leaving banks.\n\nMusk also called for a rate cut of 50 basis points to bail out dissolving banks before the Fed\u2019s rate decision yesterday.\n\nIn addition, he supported the idea of instructing the FDIC to briefly insure all deposits above the $250,000 limit to stop runs to the tellers.\n\nSEC vs Ripple: how will the lawsuit end?\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed its response to Ripple Labs\u2018 letters regarding additional authority in the Bittner and Voyager cases.\n\nAs reported by Bitcoinist, Judge Voyager found strong words for the unclear regulatory situation in the US cryptocurrency industry.\n\nRipple filed the decision as an argument in support of its defense on fair notice, pointing to Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles\u2018 writing of \u201clong-standing uncertainties\u201d for the industry about which even regulators disagree.\n\nRipple\u2019s early March supplemental authority brief regarding the Bittner case cites the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on 28 February in Bittner vs United States.\n\nIn it, the Supreme Court reiterated that fair notice should be given to the world in a manner understood by the general public, something the SEC clearly did not do with XRP.\n\nIn its brief response yesterday, the SEC stated that neither decision supports Ripple\u2019s fair notice defense and provides no basis for denying the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\n\nMoreover, the agency says it has consistently provided guidance that cryptocurrency offerings violate securities laws when they involve the offer and sale of an investment contract.\n\nVoyager does not help the defendants either, says the SEC, which contends that it was a failed plan for the potential sale of a cryptocurrency conglomerate to another company.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC concludes:\n\n\u201cDefendants shamelessly mischaracterize Voyager\u2019s bankruptcy court statements and pull snippets out of context in a misguided attempt to bolster their futile defense with fair notice.\u201d\n\nThe crypto Space ID (ID) outperforms Dogecoin and Ripple during early days\n\nID is the native cryptographic asset and governance token of Space ID, a Web3 domain management system that allows users to exchange, register and manage crypto-based domain names.\n\nThe price of ID is currently gaining about 8% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nThe ID token just made its public release on Binance\u2018s Launchpad, where trading began shortly thereafter.\n\nOn the same day, Binance announced Space ID (ID) as the 30th project on Binance Launchpad, whereas users\u2019 BNB balances have been registered since 17 March. The Binance Launchpad for Space ID was a huge success as Space ID tokens received over $2.8 billion in subscribed BNB.\n\nDuring the launchpad, the value of ID was set at $0.025. This means that from that time to now, the rise has been 2100%.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao said that this represents the ATH for Binance Launchpad. Space ID, the latest launchpad whose subscription ended hours ago, received over 8.4 million BNB tokens in commitments from 99,000 holders in 48 hours on 21 March.\n\nThe tokens were offered at 0.00007412 BNB per ID, with a total of 100 million IDs available. The final allocation will be estimated based on the number of BNB commitments relative to the total number of holders who participated."

        "title": "8 Best Yield Farming Crypto Platforms in 2023 - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Earning passive income with cryptocurrency is a goal of many crypto investors. This is understandable, since many crypto investors prefer to buy and hold crypto instead of actively trading it. If you\u2019re holding cryptocurrency and don\u2019t plan on trading it in the short term, it\u2019s worth considering various options of putting your crypto to work to grow your holdings passively.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll showcase the best yield farming crypto platforms that make it possible for you to earn yield on your cryptocurrency holdings. Please keep in mind that even though these platforms allow you to earn crypto passively, all yield farming platforms have their own risks.\n\nThere\u2019s three main ways of earning yield on your crypto holdings. In our list of the best crypto yield farming platforms, we highlighted DeFi platforms, decentralized and centralized exchanges to cover these three types of crypto yield farming:\n\nProvide liquidity on decentralized crypto exchanges\n\nUse DeFi protocols to lend cryptocurrency\n\nUse yield earning products on centralized crypto exchanges\n\nThe best yield farming crypto platforms in 2023\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s get into our list of the 8 best yield farming platforms available to cryptocurrency holders today:\n\nAave \u2014 The leading decentralized liquidity protocol\n\nYearn.finance \u2014 a popular DeFi yield farming tool\n\nUniswap \u2014 The leading decentralized exchange\n\nBinance \u2014 A crypto exchange with a suite of products for earning yield\n\nPancakeSwap \u2014 The center of BNB Chain\u2019s DeFi ecosystem\n\nHarvest \u2014 A yield farming platform powered by DeFi\n\nOasis \u2014 A DeFi-powered tool to earn yield or borrow crypto\n\nKraken \u2014 A popular exchange with crypto staking options\n\n1. Aave \u2014 The leading decentralized liquidity protocol\n\nAave is a decentralized liquidity protocol that implements a system of smart contracts that allow users to borrow crypto assets or earn interest on their holdings in a decentralized manner. Aave is essentially a set of smart contracts deployed on a blockchain, but most users will interact with the protocol through an interface such as app.aave.com.\n\nAt the time of writing, you can earn yield on about 20 different crypto assets on Aave. Usually, the assets that pay the highest yield are stablecoins such as USDT, USDP and TUSD. The yields offered by the Aave protocol depend on market demand\u2014if there is a lot of demand for borrowing a specific crypto asset, the APY offered to suppliers of that asset will grow.\n\nIn addition, Aave offers a staking option for holders of the platform\u2019s AAVE governance token. This is a good way for AAVE holders to earn yield while contributing to the security of the Aave protocol.\n\nAave was initially launched on the Ethereum blockchain, but is now also available on other blockchain platforms such as Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon and Arbitrum.\n\n2. Yearn.finance \u2014 a popular DeFi yield farming tool\n\nYearn.finance is a DeFi protocol that rose to prominence in 2020, when the concept of yield farming started gaining a lot of traction. The basic concept behind Yearn.finance is that it gives users easy access to different DeFi protocols in order to help them maximize yield.\n\nWith Yearn.finance, users can deposit tokens into Vaults. Deposited tokens are then deployed into various DeFi protocol. For each Vault that\u2019s available, you can see the list of strategies it is using to earn yield, alongside a risk score for each strategy. This is a very welcome feature as it allows users to know exactly what their deposited tokens will be used for.\n\nYearn.finance offers a broad range of vaults. Users can earn yield on assets like ETH, DAI, USDC and many other popular crypto assets. In addition, Yearn.finance provides a number of Vaults that are focused on providing liquidity to the Curve protocol.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a one-stop shop to earn yield using DeFi, Yearn.finance is certainly an option worth considering. The protocol also has a governance token called YFI.\n\n3. Uniswap \u2014 The leading decentralized exchange\n\nUniswap is a decentralized exchange that pioneered the AMM (Automated Market Maker) model for swapping tokens trustlessly. Uniswap works through liquidity pools, where users can deposit funds to provide liquidity for those that want to swap between tokens. For example, the USDC/ETH liquidity pool allows users to swap between ETH and USDC.\n\nThe incentive for providing liquidity to Uniswap liquidity pools is that the protocol charges a fee for token swaps. This fee is then distributed to the pool\u2019s liquidity providers according to the size of their share in the pool.\n\nHowever, providing liquidity on AMMs like Uniswap is not risk-free. There is the risk of impermanent loss, which essentially describes a situation where you\u2019d be better off simply holding tokens than depositing them into a liquidity pool. You are more likely to get affected by impermanent loss if you\u2019re providing liquidity for tokens that have a lot of price volatility.\n\nThe Uniswap protocol is available on different blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum and Celo. However, the liquidity that\u2019s available can vary significantly depending on which platform you\u2019re using Uniswap on.\n\n4. Binance \u2014 A crypto exchange with a suite of products for earning yield\n\nBinance is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of both user count and trading volume. In addition to the standard suite of crypto trading services, Binance also offers a set of products under the Binance Earn banner, which makes it possible for crypto investors to earn yield on their holdings.\n\nThe most notable of these products is Simple Earn, which provides a convenient way to earn yield on cryptocurrency. The product supports a large number of different cryptocurrencies and provides both flexible and locked options.\n\nWhen you\u2019re using flexible products, you deposit cryptocurrency and earn yield until you choose to withdraw your funds.\n\nIn contrast, locked products tend offer higher yields than their flexible counterparts, but require users to keep their funds deposited for a specified period of time to earn rewards. You can still withdraw your crypto from a locked product prematurely, but you won\u2019t earn rewards in this scenario.\n\nThe yield offered by Binance Earn changest according to market demand. Therefore, you don\u2019t know exactly how much you will earn with your deposit over a longer period of time.\n\nCreate Binance Account\n\n5. PancakeSwap \u2014 The center of BNB Chain\u2019s DeFi ecosystem\n\nPancakeSwap is a decentralized finance platform on the BNB Chain blockchain. Its core functionality is an AMM that functions very similarly to Uniswap. So, you can use PancakeSwap to earn rewards by providing liquidity.\n\nPancakeSwap also provides dedicated yield farms. In these yield farms, you can stake the LP tokens you get when providing liquidity on PancakeSwap to earn additional tokens. For example, if you hold CAKE/BNB LP tokens, you can stake them to earn additional CAKE tokens.\n\nIn addition, PancakeSwap also provides \u201cSyrup Pools\u201d where CAKE tokens can be staked in order to earn various tokens. These are usually tokens from projects in the BNB Chain ecosystem.\n\nOverall, PancakeSwap is a very useful platform to get familiar with if you\u2019re a fan of BNB Chain and the projects building on the platform. There\u2019s some solid opportunities to earn yield by providing liquidity or staking CAKE to earn other types of tokens.\n\n6. Harvest \u2014 A yield farming platform powered by DeFi\n\nHarvest is a platform that\u2019s designed to maximize yields for users by utilizing a variety of DeFi protocols. From this standpoint, Harvest can be seen as an alternative to Yearn.finance.\n\nLike Yearn.finance, Harvest also offers Vaults that you can deposit tokens into to earn yield. When staking, Harvest pools together tokens from multiple users in order to optimize gas fees, and utilizes auto compounding mechanisms to improve yields.\n\nThe Harvest protocol features a token called FARM, which gives holders access to the performance fees collected by the protocol\u2019s yield-generating strategies.\n\n7. Oasis \u2014 A DeFi-powered tool to earn yield or borrow crypto\n\nOasis is a tool that allows users to borrow cryptocurrency, earn interest and access leverage. For example, Oasis can be used to earn yield on your ETH thanks to increased staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into Oasis and get exposure to a larger amount of stETH with the help of the Aave protocol.\n\nOasis also gives you the option to earn from the DAI Savings Rate, which applies to holders of the Dai stablecoin. However, this savings rate is relatively modest (about 1% APY at the time of writing). The platform also provides additional yield options for DAI holders with the help of the Uniswap protocol.\n\nOasis is a solid option for earning yield in DeFi, especially for fans of the Dai stablecoin and the associated Maker protocol.\n\n8. Kraken \u2014 A popular exchange with crypto staking options\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange that has been on the market for about a decade, making it one of the longest-standing crypto exchanges. Kraken offers a cryptocurrency staking option that holders of certain cryptocurrencies can use to earn rewards.\n\nWhile staking coins isn\u2019t typically what comes to mind when one thinks of \u201cyield farming\u201d, it\u2019s certainly a good option for people who hold crypto and would like to put it to work for some extra profits.\n\nKraken offers staking services for many Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, Solana, Polygon and many others. Kraken stakes coins on users\u2019 behalf and distributes the earned staked rewards back to the users (minus a fee).\n\nCreate Kraken Account\n\nThe risks of crypto yield farming\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at the main risks for each type of crypto yield farming.\n\nDeFi protocols \u2014 Smart contract risk\n\nDecentralized finance protocols like lending protocols and yield farming protocols are susceptible to smart contract risk. Essentially, the smart contracts these protocols are comprised of can contain bugs that attackers can exploit to effectively steal funds from the protocol\u2019s users.\n\nIn some cases, even if the protocol\u2019s smart contracts are functioning as expected, a DeFi protocol could be designed poorly from an economics perspective. Savvy users could identify flaws in a protocol\u2019s economic design and exploit them to make a profit at the expense of other users.\n\nWe have seen a large number of DeFi hacks since DeFi began rising in popularity in 2020, so it\u2019s always a good idea to be careful when committing funds into DeFi protocols.\n\nDecentralized exchanges \u2014 Impermanent loss\n\nProviding liquidity on automated market maker (AMM) protocols such as Uniswap comes with the risk of impermanent loss\u2014in some cases, simply holding tokens will deliver better results than depositing them into a liquidity pool. The risk of impermanent loss is lower if you are providing liquidity for assets that tend to stay in a limited price range.\n\nYou can reduce the impact of impermanent loss by providing liquidity in pools where the two assets stay in a tight price range. For example, a pool consisting of two dollar-pegged stablecoins (let\u2019s say USDT and USDC) will have a much smaller risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers.\n\nCentralized exchanges \u2014 Counterparty risk\n\nWhen you deposit your crypto into yield earning products offered by cryptocurrency exchanges, you have to trust that the exchange will manage your funds responsibly and not lose them in risky investments or have them stolen. This is why some cryptocurrency enthusiasts advocate for keeping your crypto away from exchanges\u2014you might have heard the saying \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d.\n\nHowever, using centralized exchanges does have the benefit of convenience, as users don\u2019t have to worry about managing their private keys or the quirks of on-chain transactions.\n\nThe bottom line \u2014 There\u2019s yield farming opportunities for everyone\n\nOur yield farming crypto list has hopefully shown you that there\u2019s a plethora of opportunities out there for users that want to earn yield on their cryptocurrency holdings. If you are investing in crypto and want to earn yield on your idle coins, you can choose between various DeFi lending protocols, decentralized exchanges or centralized exchanges.\n\nOf course, every opportunity to make a profit comes with its own risks, so make sure to carefully research any platform you\u2019re looking to deposit your funds into. Good luck on your crypto journey!"
