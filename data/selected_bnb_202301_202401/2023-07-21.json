        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSuperblock, a contributor to Over Protocol, has raised $8M in two fundraising rounds from well-known businesses and VCs in South Korea. SK, Netmarble, DSC, E&Investment, Schmidt, SpringCamp, and NaverZ were among the investors.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply diving into the South Korea market with the best local partners and looking to meet global partners, accelerating us all over the world.\u201d \u2013 Ben (Jae-Yun) Kim, the founder of Superblock.\n\nThe expenses of bootstrapping and maintaining nodes have increased over time as layer 1 blockchains have grown quicker and more established. As a result, operating blockchain applications without the usage of expensive technology has become difficult.\n\nA new layer 1 blockchain called Over Protocol is based on the \u201cEthanos\u201d protocol, which only accepts active accounts as genuine. This allows full nodes to reject old data and use less storage, which lowers the amount of storage needed. Anyone will be able to run a node and function as a validator using Over on their home PCs. At EuroSys\u201921, Ethanos has been published.\n\n\u201cWith the ability for anyone to run a validator, individuals can earn $over through a process called home staking, enabling them to embrace a new lifestyle with new payment options, enhanced credit, and innovative finance opportunities,\u201d Ben added."

        "title": "China Says BTC, BNB Are Top Crypto Coins, QUBE Next? | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "As the crypto sector continues to mature, fresh dynamics and emerging trends continually reshape the market outlook. One recent notable development is the apparent shift in China\u2019s stance towards cryptocurrencies. Known for its rigid regulatory position, China has been predominantly critical of the digital asset class. However, recent developments suggest a possible reversal in its outlook. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) have been singled out as top performers, whispers have started to circulate about the potential addition of InQubeta (QUBE) to this elite list.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB)\n\nBitcoin, the first and most influential cryptocurrency, has undeniably captured the attention of many, including China. Despite regulatory scrutiny, it appears that the undeniable influence of BTC on the global financial landscape may be causing a shift in the country\u2019s attitude. The fact that Bitcoin has remained resilient amidst the global economic turmoil and continues to command a large market share makes it hard to ignore.\n\nSimilarly, Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has also caught China\u2019s attention. BNB\u2019s impressive performance is attributable to Binance\u2019s consistent growth and innovation, cementing its place as one of the top crypto coins.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) \u2013 The Emerging Contender\n\nInQubeta (QUBE), an innovative blockchain project enabling fractional investment in AI startups, is also making waves in the crypto space. The project\u2019s unique proposition, combined with its promising tokenomics, has stirred interest among diverse investors. While QUBE is not currently on China\u2019s radar as a top crypto coin, the innovative functionalities and value proposition it brings to the table might soon alter this.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s mission is to democratize AI investment, a goal that has garnered the attention of many in the crypto industry. The platform\u2019s robust utility token, QUBE, is more than just a speculative asset. It\u2019s a gateway to the exciting world of AI start-ups and plays a crucial role in the platform\u2019s unique fractional investment system.\n\nThe Future for QUBE?\n\nWith InQubeta\u2019s potential for creating a paradigm shift in the AI investment landscape, it is reasonable to speculate whether QUBE might be the next crypto coin to catch China\u2019s attention. The project\u2019s unique value proposition and robust tokenomics make it a strong contender.\n\nHowever, despite the whispers, it\u2019s crucial to understand that the journey to recognition by China, or any other major economic power, isn\u2019t straightforward. While Bitcoin and Binance Coin have made their marks, they\u2019ve also been subjected to extensive scrutiny and regulatory hurdles. The same might be expected for InQubeta if it comes under China\u2019s watchful eye.\n\nThat said, if InQubeta continues to execute its vision successfully, proving its utility and carving out a niche in the blockchain and AI space, it\u2019s plausible that the project might gain greater recognition.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile China\u2019s official recognition of BTC and BNB as top cryptos is a significant milestone for these digital assets, it is not the only benchmark for success. Many other promising projects like InQubeta are shaping the future of the industry. It will be interesting to see if QUBE joins the ranks of BTC and BNB in China\u2019s perspective. However, regardless of what the future holds, the intrinsic value and utility of InQubeta (QUBE) will continue to make it an exciting prospect for investors globally.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.
