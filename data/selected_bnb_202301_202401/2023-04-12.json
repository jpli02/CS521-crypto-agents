        "content": "I jumped at the chance to stay overnight at Folk Caf\u00e9's new bed and breakfast.\n\nIf the success of the caf\u00e9 itself is anything to go by, it was always going to be good.\n\nFolk Caf\u00e9, in Fornham St Martin, near Bury St Edmunds, has been a roaring success story since its launched in 2018.\n\nWillow House, Fornham St Martin. Pictures: Chris Morris\n\nIt's now also about to triple in size, due to its popularity.\n\nThe B&B idea came about after a former farmworker's house became available, just a few yards away.\n\nFolk Caf\u00e9 is situated on Fornham Business Court, which itself is situated in the midst 1,300 acres of farmland, on the majestic Hall Farm Estate.\n\nThe TV room\n\nToday, Hall Farm produces more than 600 acres of potatoes for supermarkets, in addition to 350 acres of onions, cereals and sugar beet.\n\nIt also boasts one of the finest Edwardian Heritage Barns in Suffolk.\n\nFolk Caf\u00e9 was only ever originally intended to serve the companies on the business park. But over the last five years, it has become a popular destination spot, or meeting point even, for people from across Suffolk Norfolk, Cambridge and Essex.\n\nThe living room\n\nHall Farm Estate itself, is typical Suffolk, offering panoramic countryside views, big open skies, and lots of light.\n\nWillow House bed and breakfast is a three-bedroom flint house.\n\nIt has now been fully renovated and refurbished, with what seem like, no expense spared.\n\nThe kitchen\n\nThe first thing you notice, apart from the fact it is immaculate, is the attention to detail.\n\nEach room, even the cupboards, offering a new surprise, from a giant Samsung TV, to a Samsung washing dryer and separate tumble dryer, ice trays, board games, wine glasses and chopsticks.\n\nThere is also a Dyson vacuum, and Dualit toaster, not to mention delightful touches of floral decoration throughout.\n\nYou only really need to remember your toothbrush.\n\nThe driveway to the business court and B&B\n\nThe house is decorated in soft pallet colours, starting with white and red in the breakfast/conservatory room, perfect for reading, to light wood and green and rouge in the kitchen, blush pink wallpaper in living room, with cream and burnt orange sofas, turquoise in the hallways and yellow in the master bedroom.\n\nThe neat little toilet and bath shower room are separate, and equally pleasing, with antique brass style shower.\n\nThere is also a satisfying crunch from the gravel driveway as you arrive, as the B&B has its own private parking and garden.\n\nOn arrival, I am greeted, with a goody bag containing Wooster's seeded loaf, butter, folk compote, granola, Greek yoghurt, crisps, beer, Prosecco, milk, tea, coffee, and sugar.\n\nI head immediately for the main sofa which is fit for a king: a king couch potato that is as it's probably the comfiest sofa I have ever sat on.\n\nMore akin to a bed.\n\nIt's only 3.30pm in the afternoon, but the house is so comfortable, I am ready to settle in for the rest of the afternoon, and evening, after a week at work.\n\nThe master bedroom\n\nBury St Edmunds is hardly a rat race, but that week, there had been incessant traffic queues, you are more likely to see in inner city London.\n\nWith a list of domestic 49 amenities, it really does feel stress free.\n\nThere is really nothing to worry about.\n\nI try to figure out the giant TV, and the choice of channels is immense.\n\nHowever, as it's a mini-holiday, I feel duty bound to explore at least a little of the immediate location.\n\nI am not too familiar with the Fornhams so decide to go on a short tour.\n\nIce trays on the freezer\n\nI've been recommended Lucy's Pizzeria in Fornham all Saints.\n\nIt's packed on the night, but they managed to fit me in for a Calabrian sausage, red onion and chill pizza, which is delicious.\n\nI visit the nearby Three Kings and the Woolpack, back in Fornham St Martin on the way back.\n\nLocals at the Three Kings Pub\n\nIt all makes for a pleasant evening out, but to be honest, the B&B is so comfortable, I'd have been just as happy, staying in.\n\nIt's a little bit chilly when I get back, and realise I don't know how to set the heating.\n\nI am however completely overlooking the log burner, staring me right in the face.\n\nThe night sky over Bury St Edmunds\n\nThis comes equipped with bucket of firelighters, gloves, tongs and a natty bottle of matches.\n\nWithin minutes I have a roaring fire, a giant TV, the comfiest sofa in the world.\n\nI settle on Inside Classical on BBC iPlayer for the rest of the night, with Elgar's Violin Concerto and Sibelius' 5th.\n\nWithout any neighbours to worry about, you can turn it up reasonably loud.\n\nBy this time, I am wishing I had come home earlier, and spent the whole Friday night 'in'.\n\nThe house sleeps 10, with use of the sofa bed. Having it to myself, I chose the master bedroom.\n\nSaturday morning at Folk Caf\u00e9\n\nI really can't remember much after that, apart from having a good 10 hours sleep, and being late for breakfast.\n\nFolk Caf\u00e9 on Saturday morning, also came as something as a surprise.\n\nI'd been advised to give 20 minutes warning, so I could get a table,\n\nForgetting this, I arrived to find it packed and thriving, with a wide range of breakfast choices to start the day.\n\nI choose scrambled eggs.\n\nFolk Caf\u00e9 also offers ready made meals or bespoke gifts for its B&B guests, such as champagne and flowers.\n\nThe whole visit went by quickly to be honest and like anything good, leaves you wanting more.\n\nScrambled eggs on toast and espresso\n\nI don't think I discovered anywhere near what the house itself, the caf\u00e9, or surrounding area had to offer, as enjoyable as it was.\n\nEven though it feels like a world unto it own, it's also less than 10 minutes outside of Bury St Edmunds, with its nightlife, bar, theatre, and culinary offerings.\n\nAt \u00a3161 a night, Willow House is not cheap, (depending on how many people are staying) but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for.\n\nAt Willow House, you get what you pay for, and whole lot more.\n\nConservatory\n\nThe full list of amenities\n\nFully equipped kitchen/Cosy living room /log burner/3 x bedrooms/1 x bathroom/sleeps up to ten/scenic views/garden view/bathroom/bath/hair dryer/cleaning products/hot water/bedroom and laundry/free washer \u2013 in building/free dryer \u2013 in building.\n\nTowels/bed sheets/soap/toilet paper/hangers/bed linen/cotton linen/iron/clothes drying rack/clothes storage/wardrobe.\n\nTV/Cot/high chair upon request/children\u2019s tableware/board games/eating and cooling/indoor fireplace/central heating/home safety/smoke alarm/carbon monoxide alarm/fire extinguisher/first aid kit/internet/Wifi with super-fast broadband.\n\nPrivate garden\n\nKitchen/space where guests can cook their own meals/refrigerator/microwave/cooking basics/pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper/dishes and silverware/bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups/freezer/dishwasher/electric cooker/oven/kettle/wine glasses/toaster/coffee/dining table.\n\nPrivate entrance/separate street or building entrance/outdoor/private back garden \u2013 fully fenced/fire pit/outdoor furniture/outdoor dining area/parking and facilities/free parking on premises/free on-street parking/services.\n\nPets allowed/assistance animals always allowed/self check-in/lockbox.\n\nTo find out more, visit: www.folk.cafe"
