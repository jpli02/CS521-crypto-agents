The world\u2019s largest crypto excha nge Binance burned 2.14 million BNB tokens worth $453 million in the 25th quarterly burn mechanism on October 16, according to the BNB burn portal. Traders reacted immediately to the burn making BNB price jump 3% in 24 hours.\n\nBinance Completes 25th Quarterly BNB Token Burn\n\nAccording to the official announcement, Binance burned 2.139 million BNB tokens in the 25th quarterly BNB token burn through the BNB Auto-Burn procedure. The latest BNB quarterly burn also includes 314.69 BNB burned through the Pioneer Burn Program.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBinance removed another 2 million BNB tokens from the circulating supply, as per the burn transaction. Currently, the BNB token\u2019s circulating supply is 151,705,885 BNB. Binance intends to bring BNB circulating supply under 100,000,000 through its BNB Auto-Burn procedure.\n\nThe crypto exchange has burned 50.29 million BNB tokens in total until now. The exchange uses an Auto-Burn protocol to reduce the total circulating supply to 100,000,000 BNB. The mechanism calculates the amount of BNB to be burned based on the BNB price and the number of blocks generated on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) during the quarter.\n\nAccording to the BNB burn portal, the estimated value of the next burn is 2,180,464 BNB. However, the current data suggest that the number of BNB tokens is likely to increase in the 26th quarterly BNB token burn.\n\nOn July 19, Binance burned 1.99 million BNB tokens worth $619 million in the 24th quarterly BNB burn. The estimated 25th quarterly BNB token burn at that time was 2,097,345 BNB.\n\nAlso Read: BTC Price Moves Above $27,000 But Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Under Fear\n\nBNB Price Jumps 3%\n\nBNB price has climbed 3% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $213.

        "content": "The Glazer family have taken Manchester United from 'a five-star hotel to a rickety old BnB', talkSPORT was told.\n\ntalkSPORT understands that one of the leading bidders for the Premier League giants, Sheikh Jassim, has withdrawn his world record offer for the club.\n\n4 The Glazers have owned the Premier League giants since 2005 Credit: AFP\n\n4 Ratcliffe looks set to acquire a 25 per cent stake in the club Credit: AFP\n\nAs a result, Sir Jim Ratcliffe is in line to step up his investment efforts by purchasing 25 per cent of the club from the Glazer family and taking control of sporting matters.\n\nWhile such a deal would be seen as a step in the right direction for Man United fans, supporters are still likely to be unhappy to see the Glazer family retaining ownership of their club, particularly after holding lengthy discussions over a full sale of the club over the last 12 months.\n\nSpeaking on The Sports Breakfast, talkSPORT's chief football correspondent Alex Crook said: \u201cI think that most Man United fans are unhappy that this is the way the situation has developed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised because I always maintain that Joel and Avram Glazer, who are the two more high-profile of the six Glazers, did not want to sell in its entirety \u2013 that\u2019s what Man United fans have been taking to the streets to demand.\n\n\u201cThe 1958 group, one of the more vocal protest groups against the owners, they\u2019ve released a statement in the last 24 hours to say they\u2019re not interested in new share issues, they\u2019re only interested in the removal of Glazer \u2013 the disease that has crippled our club for the last 18 years, so strong words from them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to force these people out of the football club.\n\n\u201cWe know they\u2019ve got thick skins, I\u2019ve seen them numerous times at Wembley when United have been in cup finals grinning away and they\u2019re clearly unaffected by the fact they\u2019re despised by the majority of Man United fans.\n\n\u201cFor me, this whole process has been a bit of a circus and a soap opera, it almost turned into X Factor Judges\u2019 Houses when asking people to make their final bids and then make a pitch for the club \u2013 that\u2019s not becoming of an institution like Manchester United.\n\n4 Sheikh Jassim pulled out of the running to buy Man United, much to fans' dismay\n\n\u201cThe whole process has been flawed, for me. It\u2019s never been about selling the football club, once again it\u2019s been about the greed of the owners who have saddled the club with up to a billion pounds worth of debts, the owners who have seen the empire that Sir Alex Ferguson built crumble before their eyes.\n\n\u201cI did a piece for the talkSPORT website about this and the problem is the Glazers.\n\n\u201cWhen they took over the club they were taking over the best stadium and the best football stadium in England, a five-star hotel if you like and they\u2019ve ran it into the ground and it\u2019s now a rickety old B&B that can\u2019t compete with Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal or even Brighton.\n\n\u201cI think that Sir Jim Ratcliffe is going to have to speak to the fans and lay out a manifesto of what he\u2019ll do about the sporting situation at the club because we understand that he wants control of sporting matters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be new people put into positions of power because to be honest the people who are in those positions have proved that they can\u2019t do their job particularly well.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do to get the stadium up to scratch? What\u2019s he going to do for the community? Sheikh Jassim was promising to invest in the infrastructure and community projects like the Man City owners.\n\n4 The Glazers have turned United from 'a five-star hotel into a rickety B&B' says Crook Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\n\u201cMost importantly, how\u2019s he going to help Erik ten Hag? He wanted to sign Harry Kane in the summer and the Glazers were never going to finance that and they ended up with Rasmus Hojlund instead.\n\n\u201cThere were other players that he\u2019d loved to have brought in but couldn\u2019t because the board couldn\u2019t get rid of people like Harry Maguire, so there\u2019s still many more questions that Man United fans want answering.\u201d"

        "content": "Australia\u2019s most welcoming, creative and thoughtful Airbnb Hosts have been recognised as part of the platform\u2019s third annual Host Awards.\n\nCelebrating the top Hosts and their listings on offer across the country, the Airbnb Host Awards aim to shine a spotlight on exceptional Hosts for the incredible hospitality they offer guests, along with the benefits they bring to their communities.\n\nWith categories including Most Unique Stay and Best Design Stay, winners range from a converted 1920s steam train carriage in Victoria\u2019s Otway Ranges, to a beautifully restored terrace in the Southern Tablelands, New South Wales.\n\nMeanwhile, The Cottage at Dunmore Farm \u2013 a circa 1860 homestead set on a working farm in Molyullah among the idyllic picturesque valley of Victoria\u2019s High Country \u2013 picked up the award for Best Nature Stay.\n\nThis year\u2019s coveted Host of the Year award went to Veronica and Colin Eastmure who treat their guests to a range of wholesome experiences, such as handwritten welcome notes, marshmallows by the fire pit, comfy robes and fluffy slippers, at their stunning Down at The Dale farmstay in the rural Sunshine Coast township of Conondale. The space was designed as a romantic retreat to slow down and recharge in a little piece of hinterland paradise, with guests consistently rating this property 5 stars, raving about the location and the thoughtful touches made by both Veronica and Colin.\n\nWest Australian Host Sarah Abbott has won the Best New Host Award for her luxury light-filled loft located in the beating heart of Fremantle\u2019s historic West End district.\n\nThis year\u2019s new category, Best Room Host, was awarded to Skye Lanser who provides a room in her design-forward Forest Lodge home in Sydney offering the ultimate inner-city experience.\n\nWinning Hosts were selected based on extensive Airbnb data, guest scores and reviews, with oversight from a panel of judges that included Australia and New Zealand Airbnb Country Manager, Susan Wheeldon and Superhost Sarah Huang (Yang-Fen) who also sits on Airbnb\u2019s global Host Advisory Board.\n\n\u201cI was blown away by the finalists included in this year\u2019s Airbnb Host Awards and the task of choosing a winner was incredibly difficult. It is clear these Hosts put a lot of love and effort into their listings and it certainly pays off,\u201d Ms Huang said.\n\n\u201cThe dedication to ensuring a seamless and memorable experience for all guests is incredibly special to see across all of the categories.\u201d\n\nSusan Wheeldon, Airbnb\u2019s Country Manager for Australia and New Zealand, said:\n\n\u201cLocal Hosts are the backbone of the Airbnb community and here in Australia we have so many incredible hosts who consistently go above and beyond for their guests and shine a spotlight on this beautiful country. We know that Hosts put in tremendous effort to ensure their listings are unique, curated and full of thoughtful touches that allow guests to immerse themselves in a truly memorable experience,\u201d Ms Wheeldon said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see that all corners of the country are covered, with winning Hosts hailing from New South Wales to Western Australia, down to Victoria and up to Queensland. There\u2019s also a range of price points, from luxe listings to tiny homes and everything in between. Each winner offers something special to suit different styles, tastes and budgets, and the Host Awards promote the diversity across over 60 categories available on Airbnb.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that the cost of living has created fundamental shifts in the way people are travelling and living, creating tangible opportunities for communities that lay off-the-beaten track. Domestic and affordable trends are seeing the benefits of tourism spreading further afield into regional Australia, and empowering locals to earn a living and make ends meet. It\u2019s incredibly exciting to see travellers still enthusiastic about exploring new destinations and Hosts act as passionate advocates for the regions and communities they live in.\n\n\u201cThese Hosts are also helping to bring valuable tourist dollars to local businesses and support jobs. Being a Host is not just about sharing a special place, it also allows people to showcase their local areas while having an opportunity for them and the businesses they rely on to earn extra income to combat the rising cost of living.\u201d\n\nRecently released research from Oxford Economics has found Airbnb is an important pillar of Australia\u2019s tourism industry, contributing $13.6-billion to Gross Domestic Product and supporting almost 95,000 Aussie jobs in 2022 alone.\n\nThe independent report titled The Economic Impact of Airbnb in APAC, found the platform accounted for approximately 7.8 percent of the tourism industry\u2019s contribution to GDP in 2022, up from 5 percent in 2019.\n\nThe report also highlights the powerful multiplier effect Airbnb guest spending has within local communities. In 2022, Airbnb guests spent a total of $12.3-billion in Australia at restaurants, retail stores and on transportation among other tourist activities.\n\nYou can find the full list of award winners and finalists at airbnb.com/hostawards23au\n\n2023 AIRBNB HOST AWARDS WINNERS\n\nHOST OF THE YEAR \u2013 recognising Hosts who provide consistently outstanding experience and hospitality to their guests\n\nWINNER: Veronica and Colin Eastmure, Conondale, QLD\n\nABOUT THE HOST: Veronica and Colin love to leave personalised touches and unexpected treats for their guests upon arrival so they feel welcome and can enjoy a sense of luxury.\n\n\u201cOur guests love the extra little touches they are greeted with upon arrival, and the outdoor bath and fire pit are regularly called out in reviews,\u201d Down at the Dale Host, Veronica said.\n\n\u201cGuests can expect a romantic getaway with privacy and views to soothe the soul. We are passionate about promoting love and togetherness, and we want to make people smile.\u201d\n\nJUDGE SUSAN WHEELDON: \u201cVeronica and Colin always go above and beyond in making the guests feel incredibly comfortable and special with their thoughtful touches and welcome notes. I loved hearing about how they prepared a delightful birthday cake for a guest\u2019s special stay. It\u2019s clear that these acts of exceptional hospitality as well as overall attention to detail and quality is why over 180 guests have consistently left 5 star reviews.\u201d\n\nBEST NEW HOST \u2013 recognising new Hosts who started Hosting on Airbnb within the past year, who create a warm and inviting space and help guests feel they belong anywhere in the world\n\nWINNER: Sarah Abbott, Fremantle, WA\n\nABOUT THE HOST: Orcades & Karoa Host, Sarah Abbott prides herself on offering a beautiful and memorable stay and has found as a new Host, her guest-first policy is the winning formula.\n\n\u201cI wanted my property to be an embodiment of the West End district to offer my guests a connection to the area. Through the design of Orcades and Karoa\u2019s interior, I share my own connection to Fremantle, a story of two generations of a family who landed in our port city after long sea crossings,\u201d Sarah said.\n\n\u201cThis story is told through the property, with all the hallmarks of renowned local architect, Brian Klopper, including a beautiful wrought iron black spiral staircase, triangular windows and vaulted timber ceiling.\u201d\n\nJUDGE SUSAN WHEELDON: \u201cIt\u2019s clear Sarah is an artist. Her eye for design is impeccable and it\u2019s obvious a lot of love and care has gone into this renovation, making it a charming stay for guests. Sarah\u2019s appreciation extends beyond interiors and we love to see her championing the beauty of Fremantle by offering recommendations to guests to experience the town like a local.\u201d\n\nBEST DESIGN STAY \u2013 recognising Hosts who showcase highly considered design throughout their homes\n\nWINNER: Mister Munro, Crookwell, NSW\n\nABOUT THE LISTING: Mister Munro is a beautifully restored Victorian terrace that pays respect to the history of the building while also feeling contemporary and fresh.\n\n\u201cI wanted to create a home fit for modern day living whilst keeping a strong heritage feel throughout,\u201d Mister Munro Host, Elise Croker said.\n\n\u201cBuilt in 1890 from locally made bricks and mortar, a tailor by the name of William Munro lived and worked in this stately residence approximately 120 years ago. Mister Munro was highly regarded by the local gentry for his expertise in the era\u2019s fashion and, thus, the interior is inspired by colours and finishes which pay respect to the history of the building while also feeling contemporary and fresh.\n\n\u201cYou can read the layers of history and the narrative of the building as you move through it. The home is a place to retreat, rest and relax, entertain and just be with family. It\u2019s warm, textural, earthy and calming. It\u2019s moody and dark in some places yet light-filled and bright in others. There\u2019s a really beautiful relationship between dark and light within this house.\u201d\n\nJUDGE SARAH: \u201cThe property does not only have a lovingly restored and captivating interior design, but also ensures that it reflects its history and original owner and tailor, William Munro in 1890. I love that Elise accommodates the guests and accentuates the historical features of the terrace such as keeping the fire going on arrival and having the record player available. It is a lovely touch. The winner of the Best Design Stay category is a visionary and talented Host who shows creativity and innovation with exceptional eye for details, Mister Munro seamlessly blends aesthetics with functionality and evokes emotion plus nostalgia, setting the host Elise apart from the competition.\u201d\n\nMOST UNIQUE STAY \u2013 recognising Hosts who provide a unique stay for their guests through a distinct home\n\nWINNER: Steam: Renovated 1920s Carriage, Forrest, Victoria\n\nABOUT THE LISTING: Steam: Train Carriage is a unique accommodation offering, with a wonderful past that will appeal to train enthusiasts, history lovers and curious types alike.\n\n\u201cSteam is a romantic homage to the simpler and slower time \u2013 The Great Age of Steam,\u201d Steam Host, Fleur Leslie said.\n\n\u201cWe have found guests of all ages have an affection for train travel. We haven\u2019t managed to pinpoint exactly why. Perhaps it\u2019s the sense of nostalgia, the thrill of adventure, or the dependable tracks that once connected people to new worlds.\n\n\u201cIf only for a few days, guests can imagine the enchantment of a 1920s train journey, a different era, a different life \u2013 then we\u2019ve created a unique experience and some unforgettable memories.\u201d\n\nJUDGE SARAH: \u201cThe property is undoubtedly a unique stay and a rare opportunity to be transported back to the 1920s. The restored wooden steam carriage is elegant and exuberant whilst offering all the amenities and luxury touches desired by guests.\u201d\n\nBEST NATURE STAY \u2013 recognising Hosts who provide an authentic country experience in regional and rural locations\n\nWINNER: The Cottage at Dunmore Farm, Molyullah, VIC\n\nABOUT THE LISTING: A beautifully restored c1860 homestead set on a 150 acre former dairy farm in the idyllic picturesque valley of Victoria\u2019s High Country. Guests will find themselves surrounded by fresh air & birdsong. Rise to misty mornings, breathe in the stillness & bathe in the starlit nights.\n\n\u201cGuests can expect a truly rejuvenating rural experience, a place to disconnect to reconnect,\u201d said The Cottage at Dunmore Farm Hosts, Bec and Angus McDougall.\n\n\u201cNestled in the heart of nature, Dunmore Farm offers breathtaking landscapes, whether it\u2019s rolling hills, grazing valleys, or lush farm pastures, not to mention amazing sunsets and exceptional stargazing opportunities. The scenery alone is a feast for the eyes.\n\n\u201cDunmore provides a peaceful, idyllic country retreat away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Depending on the season, guests can enjoy activities like picking fresh farm produce, animal feeding, or chatting to us about our restoration journey and preferences for sustainable farming.\u201d\n\nJUDGE SARAH: \u201cThe property is a classic countryside cottage, perfect for those looking for an iconic farm stay in regional Australia. While the outdoor area displays a stunning showcase of local flora and fauna from sunrise to sunset, the interior boasts an impressive collection of antique furniture that pay homage to the origins of the homestead.\u201d\n\nBEST ROOM HOST \u2013 recognising Hosts who provide a room for guests, allowing them to have the ultimate local experience\n\nWINNER: Skye Lanser, Forest Lodge, NSW\n\nABOUT THE LISTING: Skye wanted to share her inner-city design haven and create an authentic, local experience for guests.\n\n\u201cI designed and renovated my 100 year-old terrace especially to share on Airbnb, so each of the spaces have been carefully created to provide an exceptional guest experience,\u201d Sinjin Host, Skye Lanser said.\n\n\u201cI try to put myself in my guest\u2019s shoes and make sure they have everything they need for an amazing stay. The rooms are full of quirky artwork, antiques, items collected on my travels, and lots and lots of books in my floor to ceiling library.\u201d\n\nJUDGE SUSAN WHEELDON: \u201cSkye\u2019s love for design has created a room full of character and is central to everything. While it provides value, quality stays like Skye\u2019s offer guests choice when travelling to Sydney, while also providing the added bonus of design, modern comforts and ultimately feeling like a local.\u201d"
