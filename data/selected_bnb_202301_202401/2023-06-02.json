        "content": "Glasgow City Council ordered the owner of an Esmond Street flat to \u201cdiscontinue the unauthorised short stay accommodation use\u201d, as it is within a \u201csingle building sharing a means of access.\u201d\n\nFollowing a complaint by a resident, the council had decided the Airbnb use could be to \u201cthe potential detriment of neighbouring properties.\u201d\n\nBut the owner, Dr Teri Welsh, asked the Scottish Government to reconsider as there had been an \u201cunreasonable\u201d period of time to respond to an enforcement notice.\n\nThe appellant also warned shutting down Airbnbs would have a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact on the tourist industry.\n\nAfter an investigation, reporter Andrew Fleming, appointed by Scottish Ministers, has dismissed the appeal. He did decide to give more time to comply with the notice.\n\nHe said: \u201cGiven the proximity of the flat\u2019s entrance to that of the neighbouring flat, the communal close with seven other residential flats and the shared front entrance to the building, the use of the property as short stay accommodation is causing disturbance to the established residential character of the building and is being detrimental to neighbouring properties.\u201d\n\nDr Welsh had submitted proof of a planning application to change the property to a short-term let and flight bookings to show they were out of the country when the notice was served.\n\nThe appeal claimed the enforcement notice \u201cwas not served as required,\u201d as the applicant did not have 28 days to respond.\n\nIt said bookings had already been taken for this summer and it would be \u201cunfair, very stressful and inconvenient to these guests\u201d for those to be cancelled. A council statement said the use \u201cconstitutes a breach of planning control\u201d and \u201call reasonable efforts\u201d had been made to service the enforcement notice. \u201cThe council cannot account for unknown absences of residents,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe statement added the council has \u201ca robust and consistent approach to dealing with short-term lets under planning legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis notice was served, as it is highly likely that the planning application the appellant refers to will be refused, and it was considered that it was expedient and in the public interest to serve the notice to reduce the amenity impact on other residents sharing the communal close.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dr Welsh said: \u201cAs most Airbnbs in Glasgow operate from tenement buildings, and as such are currently being served with these notices, it is highly likely their enforcement will result in a severe lack of suitable accommodation for tourists visiting the city.\u201d\n\nThis will have a \u201cdetrimental effect\u201d on the local economy and \u201cthe many small businesses reliant on tourism\u201d, the applicant added.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt would be nothing less than catastrophic and highly irresponsible to dismiss the impact this will have on the tourist sector.\u201d"
