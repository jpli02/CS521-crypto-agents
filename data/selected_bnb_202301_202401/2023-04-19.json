        "content": "EDITOR'S NOTE: The video of the Air BnB in the story is not REEL Paradise \u2014 it's Dolphin Splash Zone.\n\nThe Aransas County Sheriff\u2019s Department sent out a press release Wednesday afternoon that said one of Spectrum's major hubs in the area had been vandalized, which caused an outage of Spectrum services.\n\nFrank Patton is one Rockport man who first noticed his Spectrum internet and cable were down. He said he felt the impact from home.\n\n\"I'm an older young man and I have nothing to do. I\u2019m chair ridden. I watch TV all the time, and without TV it's really boring,\" Patton said.\n\nPatton has been with Spectrum for years and said he never experienced anything like this from the company.\n\n\"It's been reliable. This is what\u2019s surprising about Spectrum. Its just really embarrassing I'd say. Spectrum's big, I mean it's really big. For them to be out this long? I'm sure we\u2019re not the only ones who have Spectrum,\" Patton said.\n\nPatton wasn't the only one who felt like the internet outage came as a surprise. Doug Frankum is the owner of Rockport Air BnB, Reel Paradise.\n\nHe takes pride in the comfort he can bring to his guests who choose his business, but the Spectrum outage caused some problems for both the business and his guests.\n\n\"It's kind of a big deal cause we're in the hospitality business and we need to talk to our customers. If they have an issue or problem, we can\u2019t communicate. So what I\u2019m going to have to do long-term until this gets fixed is just hang out here during the day and let my customers know if they have a question to come see me,\" Frankum said.\n\nFrankum said he didn\u2019t realize how crucial the internet had become to running his business.\n\n\"If I advertise I have an office that you can work in, you can\u2019t work. So I\u2019m not really fulfilling the promise i made to my customers,\u201d Frankum said.\n\nFrankum is personally buying gift cards to all his customers to apologize for any inconvenience the internet outage cost them during their stay.\n\nThe Aransas County Sheriff\u2019s Department is asking if anyone has information as to who was involved in the vandalism of the hub, to call them at 361-729-2222."

        "content": "DApps now includes 191 projects deemed as high-risk\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB Chain recently announced an update to its list of high-risk decentralized applications (dApps) on the DappBay platform, which now includes a total of 191 projects deemed as high-risk. These projects were found to be engaging in fraudulent practices such as phishing and scamming, putting users\u2019 funds and personal information at risk.\n\nBNB, which stands for \u201cBuild and Build\u201d (formerly called Binance Coin), is the blockchain gas token that fuels transactions on BNB Chain.\n\nSome of the notable projects on this revised list include Pinaki, Elvantis, Leech Protocol, Streamflow, OnlyBrain, and the XOP Project. BNB Chain identified these projects as high-risk due to a variety of reasons, such as the issuance of bogus tokens, high or opaque taxes, and malfunctioning websites or Twitter handles.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s active alert doesn\u2019t reflect the actual danger posed by the underlying DApp project. Instead, it\u2019s intended to assist consumers in conducting research before making investment decisions. This highlights the need for caution when investing in any of the dApps listed as high-risk.\n\nRead more: Binance\u2019s CZ reacts to CFTC complaint\n\nDApps are decentralized applications that run on a blockchain network, and they are often used for various purposes such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and social media. However, not all DApps are created equal, and some may be scams or pose risks to users.\n\nUsers are advised to exercise caution when interacting with any DApps or tokens listed on the Binance Chain Issues List, as they may be fraudulent or engage in risky activities. It\u2019s always important to thoroughly research any DApps or tokens before using them and to only interact with those that are reputable and have a strong track record of security and reliability.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s latest update emphasizes the significance of conducting thorough research before investing in any project, especially in the decentralized application (dApp) market.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market is projected to expand and diversify in the coming years, consumers need to remain vigilant and informed to make informed investment choices.\n\nIn July 2022, BNB Chain launched DappBay platform. The blockchain features an easy-to-use contract risk scanning tool called \u2018Red Alarm\u2018, which identifies potential high risk projects to help users protect their investments from potential rug pulls and scams.\n\nFor more on Binance, click here."
