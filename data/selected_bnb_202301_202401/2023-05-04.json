        "title": "How To Change Slippage Tolerance on PancakeSwap? - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "PancakeSwap is a popular exchange on the Binance Smart Chain. Users have flocked to it as a dependable substitute for other large decentralized exchanges (DEX). PancakeSwap runs on the BNB Smart Chain, which also touts lower transaction costs as compared to Ethereum.\n\nThe DEX is also the one with the highest trading volumes in the market, according to CoinMarketCap data. It holds the sixth rank in terms of trading volumes and market share.\n\nAlso read: Is MetaMask Safe (2023)?\n\nIf you have used PancakeSwap, you must be familiar with slippage tolerance. Before we dive deep into how to change slippage tolerance on PancakeSwap, let us understand what slippage is.\n\nSlippage in a nutshell\n\nSlippage is a market occurrence where the execution price of a trade differs from the expected price. This can happen at any time, but it\u2019s more frequent during high volatility periods when market orders are utilized.\n\nAnother cause of slippage is when a significant order is fulfilled, and the targeted price lacks adequate volume to maintain the current bid/ask spread.\n\nAlso read: How to Buy Crypto with Western Union\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrency traders, especially beginners, commonly observe the phenomenon of slippage. When conducting trades, traders have a specific price point in mind to buy or sell their assets.\n\nHowever, due to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, the price may change between the time the order is placed and the trade is executed, leading to a difference between the expected and actual execution price.\n\nHow to change slippage tolerance on PancakeSwap?\n\nWhenever users connect their wallets and conduct a trade, they can see a tab that shows the slippage tolerance for the particular transaction. Depending on the transaction, PancakeSwap usually sets the slippage at 0.5% or 1.0%.\n\nHowever, it is very easy to change it. All that users need to do is click on the \u201cpencil\u201d button next to slippage. It will redirect users to a page that looks like the one below.\n\nExperts do not recommend using a 0.1% slippage rate, as it may result in transaction failure. Additionally, users can set their own custom slippage tolerance. PancakeSwap recommends users try trading a smaller amount at a time and increasing by inputting with fewer decimal places."

        "content": "How New Zealand became the centre of the universe for rare space-themed cabins. Video / Thomas Bywater\n\nThe accommodation rental giant Airbnb has revealed data on the habits of travellers in New Zealand and overseas, as bookings are expected to exceed pre-pandemic numbers.\n\nHowever, the \u201cback to basics\u201d approach and paring back of certain products shows the room-sharing economy may not be as buoyant as the numbers predict.\n\nWith 300 million guest arrivals projected for the coming year, Airbnb made the triumphalist statement that \u201cthe pandemic is over\u201d.\n\nBed nights in New Zealand grew 40 per cent in 2022, compared with the previous year.\n\nHowever, the projections for the year ahead are at odds with the current drive for budget listings and Airbnb\u2019s decision to rethink some products.\n\nLast month it announced it was pausing its \u201cExperiences\u201d programme and would not be taking additional submissions.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s online market for guided tours was launched in 2016, allowing the public to sell cooking classes or other location-based experiences via the website.\n\n\u201cAs part of our focus on perfecting the core service, including Airbnb Experiences, we are pausing submissions of all new Experiences,\u201d a spokesperson told the Herald.\n\nThe company said it did not have any more information to share at this point but it was \u201cexcited about the future of Experiences\u201d and aimed to relaunch the product at a later date.\n\nHosts and guides with current bookings will not be affected, but they will not be able to change or submit new experiences for review.\n\nArthur Chin runs an award-winning Airbnb Experience from his Palmerston North farm. Photo / Supplied\n\nIt is not only the inventory of experiences that is being trimmed. Airbnb says it is focusing on more modest booking options for travellers on a budget.\n\n\u201cAirbnb Rooms\u201d is a rebranding of the offering for hosts leasing part of a property or a guest room. Despite the trend for renting whole properties and holiday rentals, the platform sees its immediate future in smaller-scale rentals.\n\nCo-founder and chief executive Brian Chesky says it is about \u201cgetting back to the idea that started it all\u201d, making a website for leasing spare rooms in San Francisco.\n\nThe rebranded \u201cRooms\u201d is a play appealing for hosts, facing an increased cost of living, to make additional income and for travellers to find accommodation within their means.\n\nIt represents a doubling down on messaging from November, when Chesky claimed that launching during the 2008 recession was the making of the company.\n\nThe UFO Futuro house of Ohoka is now an award-winning BnB, let out to guests. Photo / Thomas Bywater\n\nAfter a focus on exuberant unique listings and flashy promotions featuring New Zealand properties shaped like yellow submarine UFOs, it is a bit of a reality check for travellers and the company.\n\n\u201cAirbnb Plus\u201d, the website\u2019s upscale offering, featuring homes such as castles and luxury housing, had a restructuring after the 2020 crunch. It now exists as a more limited stock of quality-controlled properties.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the company also shelved ambitious plans to integrate air travel and transport. Hiring travel consultant and former Virgin America chief executive Fred Reid, the company toyed with the idea of an airline in 2018.\n\nWith these lofty goals reined in, it seems the site is best suited to smaller-scale budget trips.\n\nAs travel patterns are beginning to show, city breaks are growing in popularity. Private rooms in Sydney and Melbourne are among the most popular on the website and, with eight out of 10 rooms listed for under $150, it\u2019s an affordable way of visiting pricier destinations.\n\nWhere Kiwis booked on Airbnb\n\nTop international destinations booked by New Zealanders on Airbnb\n\n1.
