The statistics find reinforcement in the real-life case of Lebanon\u2019s vibrant crypto market.\n\nThe country-specific stablecoin data is non-existent, but several Lebanese stablecoin brokers and crypto users in Lebanon who spoke with DL News confirm a widespread preference for Tether on Tron. Almost all of them attributed Tron\u2019s popularity to low fees and speed.\n\nBEIRUT, LEBANON: Cryptocurrency broker Nader Dirany pictured outside his office in the Beirut suburb of Ain el Remmeneh (Jacob Russell)\n\nBut Tron\u2019s hold on the market is also tied to the popularity of centralised crypto exchange Binance in the country, most of them said.

The client explained to Awad that he had not used crypto before but wanted to try it after losing money in the banking crisis.\n\nBEIRUT, LEBANON: A branch of Blom Bank in downtown Beirut which has had steel plating welded onto its exterior to protect it from protestors angered at the deep economic and fiscal crisis that Lebanon is mired in.

The dealer, who wanted to remain anonymous, said eight to ten other individuals were handling similar volumes.\n\nTether\u2019s rise on Tron helped by Binance\n\nAlthough analysts have long held concerns over a lack of transparency in Tether\u2019s reserve management, in Lebanon it is seen as the most independent and reliable stablecoin.\n\nIn a country with a dysfunctional banking system and severe hyperinflation, Tether often stands in as a digital dollar. Many Lebanese use Tether for money transfer and remittances without ever interacting with other parts of the crypto market.\n\nLaunched in 2018 by entrepreneur Justin Sun, Tron has established an extensive ecosystem of DeFi protocols, stablecoins and tokens \u2014 many named after him like lending protocol JustLend or decentralised exchange SUN.\n\nTron's total value locked, a metric for investor deposits in DeFi\n\nHowever Tron\u2019s reputation has suffered from controversy brought about by its sometimes flamboyant founder. The US SEC sued Sun in March for selling unregistered securities and he has been the subject of numerous allegations of market manipulation.\n\nThe dominance of Tron and Tether, both in Lebanon and much of the global south, highlights patterns in crypto adoption where people are seeking to insulate themselves from economic volatility.\n\nNOW READ: \u2018Tether is next\u2019 says short seller who bet against Silvergate and Signature Bank\n\nLebanon underwent a wave of crypto adoption as its financial system collapsed in late 2019, slashing GDP by 50% and plunging about three-quarters of the population into poverty. The decline coincided with the bull market of 2019-20, creating a dual incentive for adoption.\n\nA 2022 Chainalysis report noted that Lebanon had received cryptocurrency valued at $60 billion in the year ending June 2022, second only to Turkey in the region.\n\nEarly in Lebanon\u2019s adoption curve, sending Tether on Tron was free with Binance, which had marketed itself aggressively in Lebanon and quickly became the go-to exchange for new users. Binance didn\u2019t respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nDeveloper Simon Dorvil explained, \u201cCustomers aren\u2019t inclined to bridge their assets, so central exchanges favouring a network is enough to set a precedent.\u201d Dorvil is co-founder of Canadian blockchain payments app Sinbad, which leverages Polygon and is currently launching in Lebanon and leverages the Polygon network.\n\nJBEIL, LEBANON: A binance-affiliated crypto brokerage in the coastal town of Jbeil, Lebanon. (Jacob Russell)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that although Tron tokens incur fewer gas fees than Ethereum tokens, they are still not the cheapest. Sending Tether over Polygon is consistently cheaper in terms of network fee,\u201d he said.\n\nBut by the time Tether became available on Polygon last year, years of zero or cheap fees had already entrenched Tron as the favourite network in the minds of Lebanese crypto users. Retail users and brokers alike, the vast majority using Binance, pass each other Tron addresses as a matter of course.\n\nNOW READ: Binance controls 90% of TrueUSD\u2019s supply amid increased pressure on the stablecoin\n\n\u201cWe can recognise a Tron address just by looking at it,\u201d said Nader Dirany. \u201cSome things you can\u2019t really explain but intuitively it\u2019s a case of going with the flow.\u201d\n\nTether is \u2018the most stable, unstable stablecoin!\u2019\n\nDespite the concerns around Tether\u2019s reserve management, it is seen in Lebanon as the most independent and reliable stablecoin. Tether briefly lost its peg in May 2022 to as low as $0.95 right after TerraUSD\u2019s collapse, and it continues to suffer from criticism of its poor auditing record.\n\nBEIRUT, LEBANON: Cryptocurrency broker Nader Dirany pictured in front of a bank branch opposite his office in the Beirut suburb of Ain el Remmeneh. After Lebanon's banking crisis started in 2019 many banks welded steel plating onto their branches to protect them from angry depositors. (Jacob Russell)\n\nNasim Dirany, Nader\u2019s brother and partner in brokerage Buy Bitcoin Lebanon, isn\u2019t deterred by any of that. \u201cTether proved itself through the bear market, while all the others suffered in some way,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s the most stable, unstable stablecoin!\u201d\n\nAlthough other stablecoins and chains may be cheaper to use, in Lebanon they often suffer from association, real or perceived, with certain brands.\n\n\u201cBNB tokens are cheaper,\u201d Nader Dirany said. \u201cBut people can\u2019t escape the idea that it is owned by Binance, that it isn\u2019t decentralised.\u201d\n\nBNB Chain, which Binance says is short for Build & Build, was previously called the Binance Smart Chain. BNB Chain was launched by Binance, which the exchange continues to help develop but claims to no longer control.\n\nTether is the most popular stablecoin by market capitalisation\n\nAs for USDC, said Dirany, \u201cmany people think that the \u2018C\u2019 in \u2018USDC\u2019 stands for \u2018Coinbase.\u201d\n\nWho is Justin Sun anyways?\n\nThe fact that Lebanese users are not put off by the concerns that dog both Tether and Tron in wider crypto circles points to fundamental differences in use case.\n\nNOW READ: Justin Sun\u2019s stUSDT dominates real-world asset DeFi as the sector doubles\n\nCrypto engagement in affluent countries where there is a functional financial infrastructure is usually discretionary and pursues profit. Users tend to go \u2018down the rabbit hole,\u2019 engaging with different tokens, protocols and communities.\n\nIn Lebanon, crypto adoption has arisen out of necessity and, although there are many highly sophisticated users, many seem indifferent to behind-the-scenes machinations of the crypto world.\n\nFor example, worries over Justin Sun, Tron\u2019s trouble-courting founder, simply don\u2019t register in Lebanon, where \u201c99% of people don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Dirany said.\n\nSome, especially among older users, may not be fully aware of what distinguishes cryptocurrency from other forms of money transfer. Most Lebanese users need to move money as reliably, cheaply and quickly as possible. Tron was cheap and worked and that was all most cared to know about it.\n\n\u201cTron was the cheapest in 2019, 2020,\u201d said Jihad Rizk, a Beirut based developer. \u201cMost of us got used to using it and got familiar with it. Also, you\u2019re not talking about people who are really technically proficient.\u201d\n\nJBEIL, LEBANON: The doormat in a binance-affiliated crypto brokerage in the coastal town of Jbeil, Lebanon.

        "title": "COLUMN: Orillia play puts focus on 'complex human relationships' - OrilliaMatters",
        "content": "'Bed and Breakfast,' which is running until Aug. 11 at Orillia Opera House, is a 'powerful experience,' says reviewer\n\nThe following is a review of the current play, Bed and Breakfast, by Andrew Wagner-Chazalon.\n\nIt's not uncommon for actors to break the fourth wall, to speak directly to the audience rather than speaking to each other. But there is another wall in the theatre that is much more rarely broken \u2014 the one that exists between audience members.\n\nFor a couple of hours we are in the darkness together, watching the same play, laughing and weeping and even breathing in tandem. But afterward, few of us ever do more than exchange simple pleasantries with the strangers we are sitting beside.\n\nIt takes a powerful experience to crack those walls, but they were shattered this week at the opening of the Orillia Opera House\u2019s production of Bed and Breakfast. After the applause faded, the lights had come up, and the audience began shuffling out of the theatre, we couldn\u2019t help but acknowledge that we had all been moved together.\n\nThe show is so good \u2014 so well written, directed, and performed, so funny, touching, and thought-provoking \u2014 that all around the theatre you could see strangers nodding to each other and even speaking in approval and delight.\n\nYou could, I suppose, summarize Bed and Breakfast quite simply: Brett (Thomas Alderson) and Drew (Matt Pilipiak) are a gay couple from Toronto who inherit a home in a small Ontario town. Rather than selling the house and staying in the city, they decide to move to the town and open a Bed and Breakfast.\n\nYou can picture where this will go, right? As the only openly gay couple in town, they will no doubt encounter reactions that range from bemusement to outright hostility. But gradually their charm and joy will win over the locals, and they will all live happily in small town bucolic bliss. It\u2019s Normal Rockwell meets RuPaul.\n\nIn the hands of a lesser playwright, that\u2019s exactly how this would unfold. But Mark Crawford is too good a writer for that. Instead, we are engulfed in a world of complex human relationships.\n\nYes, there\u2019s hostility and bemusement, love and joy, but there are also family secrets, misperceptions, mixed motives, intersecting storylines, and an entire small town\u2019s worth of characters who make it all happen.\n\nTelling those stories requires incredible feats of agility from the two actors, both of whom are making their Orillia Opera House debuts. Each presents a dozen or so characters \u2014 male and female, young and old \u2014 whipsawing in and out of roles with breathtaking speed.\n\nThere are scenes with four, five or more characters on stage at once, and there\u2019s not a moment where you wonder which character each of these two is portraying. In one hilarious scene, Pilipiak plays both bride and groom as they engage in noisy and enthusiastic honeymoon sex \u2014 a feat which would be impressive enough if he and Alderson weren\u2019t also portraying five other people and a puppy in the same scene. It\u2019s truly a tour de force from both actors.\n\nDriving all this mayhem is director Fiona Sauder. The winner of multiple Dora awards, she is widely regarded as one of the most exciting young directors working in this country, and this show reveals why. The production crackles and snaps like a thing possessed, bringing us to the brink of tears then engulfing us in roars of laughter with nary a pause for breath.\n\nWe travel from sharp, pointed moments to broad physical comedy with whiplash-inducing speed, and the entire ride is a non-stop thrill.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting the work of the production team, particularly lighting designer Andrew Dollar, as well as production manager Ashley Whitten and assistant stage manager Amelia Mielke-O\u2019Grady. The lighting and sound changes throughout the show are rapid and effective, yet often so subtle that you hardly even notice they\u2019re happening.\n\nThe set is minimal \u2014 a table, two chairs, and a drop cloth \u2014 and the props nearly nonexistent. But the combination of lighting, sound, direction, and performance bring it all seamlessly to life as we journey with Brett and Drew and a host of other characters.\n\nKudos also to the Opera House itself for bringing this fascinating and entertaining show to Orillia. It\u2019s a testament to the leadership of artistic director Jesse Collins that this small town theatre can present a show that explores life in a small town, with all its joys and heartaches, and anticipate that audiences will respond. Theatre at its best shines a light on the audience and invites us to see ourselves in the stories being told on stage. And this production truly does just that.\n\nBed and Breakfast runs until Aug. 11. The Opera House summer season concludes with Norm Foster\u2019s Halfway There, running Aug. 16 to Sept. 1.\n\n*************************"

But afterward, few of us ever do more than exchange simple pleasantries with the strangers we are sitting beside.\n\nIt takes a powerful experience to crack those walls, but they were shattered this week at the opening of the Orillia Opera House\u2019s production of Bed and Breakfast. After the applause faded, the lights had come up, and the audience began shuffling out of the theatre, we couldn\u2019t help but acknowledge that we had all been moved together.\n\nThe show is so good \u2014 so well written, directed, and performed, so funny, touching, and thought-provoking \u2014 that all around the theatre you could see strangers nodding to each other and even speaking in approval and delight.\n\nYou could, I suppose, summarize Bed and Breakfast quite simply: Brett (Thomas Alderson) and Drew (Matt Pilipiak) are a gay couple from Toronto who inherit a home in a small Ontario town. Rather than selling the house and staying in the city, they decide to move to the town and open a Bed and Breakfast.\n\nYou can picture where this will go, right? As the only openly gay couple in town, they will no doubt encounter reactions that range from bemusement to outright hostility. But gradually their charm and joy will win over the locals, and they will all live happily in small town bucolic bliss. It\u2019s Normal Rockwell meets RuPaul.\n\nIn the hands of a lesser playwright, that\u2019s exactly how this would unfold. But Mark Crawford is too good a writer for that. Instead, we are engulfed in a world of complex human relationships.\n\nYes, there\u2019s hostility and bemusement, love and joy, but there are also family secrets, misperceptions, mixed motives, intersecting storylines, and an entire small town\u2019s worth of characters who make it all happen.\n\nTelling those stories requires incredible feats of agility from the two actors, both of whom are making their Orillia Opera House debuts. Each presents a dozen or so characters \u2014 male and female, young and old \u2014 whipsawing in and out of roles with breathtaking speed.\n\nThere are scenes with four, five or more characters on stage at once, and there\u2019s not a moment where you wonder which character each of these two is portraying. In one hilarious scene, Pilipiak plays both bride and groom as they engage in noisy and enthusiastic honeymoon sex \u2014 a feat which would be impressive enough if he and Alderson weren\u2019t also portraying five other people and a puppy in the same scene. It\u2019s truly a tour de force from both actors.\n\nDriving all this mayhem is director Fiona Sauder. The winner of multiple Dora awards, she is widely regarded as one of the most exciting young directors working in this country, and this show reveals why. The production crackles and snaps like a thing possessed, bringing us to the brink of tears then engulfing us in roars of laughter with nary a pause for breath.\n\nWe travel from sharp, pointed moments to broad physical comedy with whiplash-inducing speed, and the entire ride is a non-stop thrill.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting the work of the production team, particularly lighting designer Andrew Dollar, as well as production manager Ashley Whitten and assistant stage manager Amelia Mielke-O\u2019Grady. The lighting and sound changes throughout the show are rapid and effective, yet often so subtle that you hardly even notice they\u2019re happening.\n\nThe set is minimal \u2014 a table, two chairs, and a drop cloth \u2014 and the props nearly nonexistent. But the combination of lighting, sound, direction, and performance bring it all seamlessly to life as we journey with Brett and Drew and a host of other characters.\n\nKudos also to the Opera House itself for bringing this fascinating and entertaining show to Orillia. It\u2019s a testament to the leadership of artistic director Jesse Collins that this small town theatre can present a show that explores life in a small town, with all its joys and heartaches, and anticipate that audiences will respond. Theatre at its best shines a light on the audience and invites us to see ourselves in the stories being told on stage. And this production truly does just that.\n\nBed and Breakfast runs until Aug. 11. The Opera House summer season concludes with Norm Foster\u2019s Halfway There, running Aug. 16 to Sept. 1.\n\n*************************"
