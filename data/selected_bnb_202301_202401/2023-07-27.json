        "title": "New stablecoin stumbles as Binance's Changpeng Zhao hints at unstable stables - CoinGeek",
        "content": "The new First Digital USD (FDUSD) stablecoin\u2019s debut was anything but auspicious, while cryptic comments by Binance\u2019s founder about stablecoin stability have left the \u2018crypto\u2019 sector bracing for impact.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 26, the Hong Kong-based First Digital Group celebrated the debut and listing of its new FDUSD stablecoin on Binance, the world\u2019s largest digital asset exchange by trading volume. But the U.S. dollar-backed FDUSD appears to have tripped down the red carpet.\n\nWithin moments of FDUSD\u2019s debut, Binance abruptly announced that it had \u201cpostponed\u201d the listing due to \u201cFDUSD Pairs\u2019 liquidity providers experiencing technical issues.\u201d Binance said it decided to \u201chalt trading \u2026 and cancel all pending orders on FDUSD, to ensure utmost protection for our users.\u201d Binance pledged to restart FDUSD trading later that same day.\n\nAt the time of its scheduled debut, FDUSD was only transactable on Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC aka BNB Smart Chain). Only a tiny sliver of the initial 10.11 million tokens was being held outside Binance wallet addresses.\n\nBinance offers a \u2018zero maker fee\u2019 promotion for customers trading FDUSD for either Binance\u2019s in-house BNB token, the formerly Binance-backed BUSD stablecoin, or Tether (USDT). Binance also added FDUSD to its Binance Convert feature, allowing users to trade FDUSD for other tokens, including BTC and ETH, plus various fiat currencies.\n\nWhen it first announced its stablecoin plans, First Digital claimed it was in discussions with all major exchanges regarding possible listings, but Binance founder Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao is so far the only one to take the FDUSD bait.\n\nFirst Digital Group claims FDUSD\u2014issued by a First Digital subsidiary called FD121 Limited\u2014is \u201c1:1 backed with high-quality cash and cash equivalent reserves, which are held in segregated accounts in regulated financial institutions and are monitored and audited by independent third parties.\u201d The statement went on to qualify that \u201cFDUSD is intended to be redeemable 1:1 for equal value in U.S. dollars.\u201d\n\nFirst Digital Group includes First Digital Trust, a Hong Kong-registered custodian whose CEO Vincent Chok declared that FDUSD \u201coffers a transparent, reliable and trusted alternative that provides the predictability corporates and investors are demanding.\u201d\n\nWell, maybe. First Digital is/was a major custodian of the assets (allegedly) backing the TUSD stablecoin. The custodial choices of TrueUSD\u2014the company behind TUSD\u2014haven\u2019t always been inspiring, as they included not only the recently insolvent Nevada-based Prime Trust but also Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank. The latter two collapsed spectacularly earlier this year as \u2018crypto winter\u2019 froze their assets off.\n\nTrueUSD stopped sharing its custodial numeric allocations shortly after it was acquired by Techteryx, a murky Asian entity that insists it totally isn\u2019t a beard for Tron founder Justin Sun, just as the Huobi exchange insists equally loudly that it, too, has nothing to do with Sun.\n\nBy late Wednesday, CoinGecko data showed more than three-quarters of all FDUSD trading volume on Binance was for USDT, while the FDUSD-BNB pair accounted for a mere 1%. So, trading one stablecoin for another\u2026Bullish?\n\nStumblecoins\n\nThe stablecoin sector has had a tumultuous year. TUSD more than quadrupled its cap to over $3.1 billion, although that\u2019s since dropped back slightly to $2.8 billion. Like FDUSD, TUSD was extended \u2018zero trading fee\u2019 incentives after Binance was forcibly ousted from its BUSD partnership with New York-based Paxos Trust.\n\nThe New York Attorney General forced the pair to separate this spring after concluding that Binance was transacting in a version of BUSD it called Binance-Peg BUSD on its own BSC network and that on multiple occasions, there were more than a billion B-Peg BUSD circulating that weren\u2019t backed by any reserve assets. From a peak of $23.5 billion last November, less than $3.8 billion BUSD is currently left in the wild.\n\nBefore this decoupling, CZ had begun forcibly converting Binance customers\u2019 USDC to BUSD in September 2022. This was largely viewed as an anti-competitive push to diminish USDC, which was beginning to challenge Tether\u2019s market share dominance at the time.\n\nUSDC is run by a consortium involving Circle and U.S. exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN). USDC has since seen its market cap plummet by more than one-half from its mid-2022 peak of over $56 billion to its current sum of $26.5 billion. Over that same period, market leader Tether has added over $25 billion to its cap, which currently sits at nearly $84 billion.\n\nEven before the collapse of rival exchange FTX, Binance was among the largest recipients of Tether, despite CZ likening Tether to \u201ca black box\u201d for its refusal to submit to an audit of its billions of alleged reserves. CZ also expressed doubts that Tether would have the capacity to convert all USDT on a 1:1 basis with the U.S. dollar should push come to shove.\n\nAnd that pushing and shoving may be just around the corner.\n\nThere\u2019s some lovely filth down here\n\nUnlike Tether\u2019s black box, CZ has been likened to an open book, at least in terms of his willingness to bend/break the rules to pad Binance\u2019s bottom line.\n\nBut with Binance increasingly unwelcome in markets around the world\u2014Binance withdrew its German license application this week\u2014and trad-fi partners looking to avoid guilty-by-association, there\u2019s mounting suspicion that Binance\u2019s efforts to promote certain stablecoins over others are intended to create a walled garden in which actual dollars flow in but rarely need to flow out.\n\nThe day before FDUSD\u2019s launch, a cryptic tweet from CZ claimed that \u201c\u2018stable\u2019 coins\u2026 are not always stable.\u201d CZ followed up on Wednesday by tweeting that the BTC token \u201cis more stable than stable coins now\u2026\u201d\n\nFor all we know, CZ is just messing with peoples\u2019 heads, but there are several external forces here that may be coming to a head.\n\nFor one, the U.S. Department of Justice is prepping serious criminal charges against both Binance and CZ and the fact that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was recently spotted hanging around the DoJ\u2019s New York offices\u2014nearly a week before a hastily scheduled court appearance on his own criminal case\u2014adds more fuel to that fire.\n\nCZ was an original investor in FTX before SBF forcibly bought out CZ\u2019s stake in mid-2021. At the time, SBF was trying to craft a regulatory-friendly image around his own criminal empire, and CZ\u2019s criminal rep wasn\u2019t helping. But with CZ having administered the coup de grace that led to FTX\u2019s demise, SBF might be about to use his intimate understanding of Binance\u2019s operations for a slice of best-served cold revenge.\n\nIf SBF is getting ready to flip on CZ to save his own skin, that could leave CZ with only one card left to play in his own negotiations with the DoJ: flipping on Tether. There\u2019s no honor among these thieves, and with the DoJ already having a variety of potential criminal charges it could file against Tether\u2014and SBF could potentially fink on both Binance and Tether\u2014CZ better bring the goods and bring \u2018em quick.\n\nIf CZ\u2019s not asking his lawyers to at least explore his options in this area, perhaps \u2018unstable\u2019 isn\u2019t an attribute limited to tokens.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

Baby DogeCoin\u2019s integration with the testnet could enable a vastly superior number of transactions per second by the time the full launch of opBNB takes place.\n\nWhat is Baby DogeCoin?\n\nBaby DogeCoin is a Dogecoin-inspired meme coin built on BNB Chain. It is a community-driven project that has a unique burning mechanism designed to make BABYDOGE become increasingly scarce over time. A percentage of each transaction is automatically burned, which continually reduces the number of BABYDOGE tokens in circulation and contributes towards price appreciation.\n\nBaby Doge Coin also launched a Burn Portal in early-2023, which enables token holders to manually contribute towards the auto-burn mechanism by sending BABYDOGE tokens to a defunct crypto address.\n\nOn top of its deflationary tokenomics, BABYDOGE token holders receive financial rewards each time a transaction takes place. 5% of all transaction value is airdropped proportionally to wallets that own BABYDOGE, which provides consistent passive income for all members of the Baby Doge Coin community.\n\nHow will opBNB improve efficiency for Baby DogeCoin?\n\nAs a layer-2 scalability solution for BNB Chain, opBNB can bring improved transaction processing speeds and higher throughput for all user interactions. Since Baby DogeCoin is a BEP-20 token, it is native to BNB Chain, and all opBNB-based BABYDOGE transactions will benefit from these performance enhancements.\n\nOptimistic rollups are used to process a higher number of transactions without the need to achieve consensus for each one. They reduce strain on BNB Chain\u2019s underlying layer-1, which makes transactions cheaper, boosts throughput, and makes the entire process of interacting with the blockchain much faster.\n\nBaby DogeCoin token holders will be able to transact on a much more efficient blockchain network thanks to the project\u2019s integration with opBNB Testnet. opBNB can process over 4000 transactions per second (TPS), a significant upgrade to Binance Smart Chain\u2019s 160 TPS, with an average fee of just $0.005.\n\nWhen will opBNB layer-2 launch?\n\nAs stated, opBNB remains in its testnet phase. The full launch of opBNB layer-2 has yet to be announced, with dApps in the ecosystem being encouraged to integrate with the testnet to fix any bugs before a full launch date has been set. This can help to iron out any possible security issues and ensure that opBNB layer-2 performs as planned by the time it goes live to the public.\n\nBaby DogeCoin price prediction\n\nBABYDOGE is currently valued at $0.0000000012 per token. The CoinCodex price prediction algorithm anticipates that BABYDOGE will climb to $0.000000001317 in the next 30 days."

        "content": "Whether you\u2019re new in town or looking to spruce up your next city staycation, you\u2019ll want to hang around for these amazing Airbnbs. From whimsical treehouses with stained glass windows to panoramic coastal penthouses, we have your next Perth adventure covered.\n\nWhere To Stay In Perth?\n\nPerth stretches pretty far north and south, so we'll forgive you for being a little unsure about where to stay if it's your first time. To help you out, we've rounded up plenty of options to suit every type of stay.\n\nPerth CBD and Northbridge\u2014For easy access to the best dining, nightlife and cultural experiences, a central stay in the CBD or Northbridge is what you're after.\n\nFremantle\u2014Think of Fremantle (or Freo) as Perth's second CBD, but with a much more eclectic and relaxed vibe. It's home to some of the best eating and drinking holes, plus cool boutiques, second-hand stores, art galleries and music venues. Plus, it's just a half hour ferry ride from Rottnest Island.\n\nInner City\u2014Suburbs like Mount Lawley, Subiaco and Leederville are great places to stay if you're keen to escape the traffic and chaos of the city without going too far.
