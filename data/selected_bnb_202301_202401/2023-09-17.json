        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nThe crypto market is a hotbed of speculation and excitement, with Binance Coin (BNB) currently under the spotlight. However, it isn\u2019t for the right reasons, considering its persistent price slump. The speculation around the exchange token is whether it can surpass the $255 mark or not after a price uptick. On the other hand, InQubeta (QUBE) is making waves in the crypto world, raising over $3 million in its fundraising efforts.\n\nThis article will delve into the recent price outlook of Binance Coin and whether it can break through the $225 resistance. Further, the article will explore InQubeta\u2019s impressive fundraising achievement and why it is one of the altcoins to watch.\n\nInQubeta ($QUBE): Over $3 Million in Fundraising\n\nInQubeta and its utility token, $QUBE, have emerged as formidable contenders in the crypto scene. Its robust ecosystem, real-world utility, and disruptive nature contribute to its appeal. As a result, there has been massive presale participation, with over $3 million raised in fundraising, signifying its growing prominence and impending adoption. Hence, $QUBE is currently the best new crypto to invest in.\n\nIts disruptive concept revolves around reshaping the fundraising landscape of the AI industry. As an intersection between blockchain technology and AI, it aims to become the first crowdfunding platform for AI startups via cryptocurrency. That is, through its $QUBE token, AI developers can raise funds for their startups. Additionally, it also seeks to democratize access to the profitable AI market by introducing NFTs and the concept of fractional investment.\n\nIts upcoming custom-built NFT marketplace, which will form an integral part of the ecosystem, will play a critical role in AI fundraising and investment. AI startups can raise funds by minting investment opportunities, which will be tokenized as NFTs and offered to investors. These equity-based NFTs will in turn be fractionalized, thereby giving everybody access to participate in the lucrative AI industry.\n\nFurther, the appeal of the $QUBE token lies in its real-world utility. Besides being used for AI startups fundraising and investments in AI ventures, it will also be used for governance and staking. Token holders will have a say in the operation and future of the platform. Additionally, holders can stake the token to earn passive income in addition to the substantial return that will come from holding, making it arguably the best coin to invest in.\n\nThe presale is currently in its fourth stage at $0.0133, with analysts forecasting a 30x climb in its value. As a result, it is a solid investment not to be missed, which investors can participate in by following the link below.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB): Road to $225 or Price Reversal?\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange, the largest centralized exchange in the cryptoverse. Additionally, it is also the utility token for Binance Smart Chain and Binance Chain. Hence, Binance Coin is not only an integral part of the Binance ecosystem but also of the crypto market. It ranks 4th in the broader crypto market, which underscores its relevance and dominance in the crypto scene. As a result, it represents a top crypto to buy.\n\nHowever, regulatory uncertainty and scrutiny around Binance Coin have resulted in its decline from over $340 in the second quarter of 2023 to trading a little over $200 now. Nevertheless, a recent uptick in Binance Coin\u2019s price has led to speculation about whether it can surpass the $225 mark. Some of the factors that will contribute to its rally to reach this threshold include positive sentiment and increased demand.\n\nWith the current situation, Binance Coin appears poised to pass the $225 threshold. Hence, it is a great cryptocurrency to buy now in anticipation of a stronger rally in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe recent uptick in the price of Binance Coin after a persistent decline has led to speculation about whether it will pass the $225 threshold. Meanwhile, InQubeta ($QUBE) recently achieved a significant milestone, raising over $3 million in its fundraising activity. With its traction set to continue, thanks to its disruptive nature and solid fundamentals, $QUBE is one of the best cryptos to buy for its innovative concept and explosive growth potential.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."

        "content": "The Gist: Meri Brown from 'Sister Wives' has a best friend named Jenn Sullivan.\n\nThe two host a \"Fridays With Friends\" live stream on Meri's Instagram account.\n\nFans think there's more to their relationship.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe cast of the hit TLC series Sister Wives is constantly changing. With Kody Brown, his wife Robyn, his three ex-wives, and their 18 children, the family is growing or shrinking each and every day.\n\nBut, there are a few non-family members who also make appearances on the show. One that fans are slowly starting to get to know is Jenn Sullivan. Does Meri Brown's friend help out the family? Here is everything to know about her.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nJenn Sullivan is a friend of 'Sister Wives' star Meri Brown \u2014 but is that it?\n\nOutside of the popular reality TV show, Meri Brown owns Lizzie's Heritage Inn, a bed and breakfast located in Utah. The hotel is managed by her very close friend Jenn Sullivan. So, they are business partners as well as friends. There are rumors about their relationship beyond this, but we'll get to that in a moment.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nFirst, you should know that when they are not working at the inn, Meri and Jenn host a \"Fridays With Friends\" livestream on Meri's Instagram account every week to discuss a variety of topics.\n\nSometimes, they even share weird stories from the inn, and believe it or not, they are both convinced that the hotel is haunted. Jenn has claimed that the TV flicks on and off without anyone touching a remote. Meri has stated that a ghost is most likely her mother who passed away.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThis segment has been a great way for fans to get to know the family friend on a more personal level. Jenn's Instagram handle is @justjennreally, but her account is currently private with nearly 5,000 followers.\n\nJenn Sullivan and Meri Brown had a drinking controversy.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nMost of the time, the ladeis' Instagram live sessions are great fun and harmless. But, there was one incident during one of their live streams in April 2023 when the two of them couldn't stop laughing and mispronouncing the names of fans who tuned in.\n\nEven though they claimed to be just tired, viewers weren't buying that at all and were starting to get concerned. One person even commented and asked them what they were smoking.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"The two of us aren't smoking anything. I've heard that stuff kills brain cells,\" Jenn responded. Meri also clapped back at the fan. Nevertheless, both of them are adults and should be allowed to get tipsy (or engage in legal activities of their choice), even if they aren't willing to admit it to the public.\n\nFans believe that Jenn Sullivan and Meri Brown are a couple.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBased on the fact that they spend a lot of time together and work together, fans are starting to speculate whether or not the two are together romantically."
