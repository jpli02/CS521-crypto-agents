        "title": "BNB Chain Prepares For Landmark Upgrade, Is This Why More DeFi Fans Are Loading Up QUBE? - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "ETH\n\nBy bridging the gap between AI startups and investors, InQubeta continues to stand out among DeFi investors and enthusiasts.\n\nIn blockchain technology, few platforms have garnered as much attention and acclaim as the Binance (BNB) Chain. As BNB Chain prepares for a transformative upgrade, decentralized finance (DeFi) enthusiasts find themselves captivated by the rising allure of the InQubeta (QUBE) token. Could the upcoming milestone upgrade catalyze increased interest in QUBE among DeFi enthusiasts?\n\nThe InQubeta platform brings an innovative approach by effectively bridging the gap between AI startups and investors. This unique strategy has resulted in the QUBE non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace gaining significant attention, propelling it to the forefront as the best crypto investment within the AI sector. With its wide-reaching adoption and an exceptional team behind it, InQubeta disrupts the entire crypto industry through its revolutionary staking platform.\n\nLet's examine why more DeFi fans load up QUBE as BNB Chain prepares for a landmark upgrade.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Gaining Momentum Amongst DeFi Enthusiasts\n\nInQubeta continues to surge as the first-ever crypto crowdfunding platform that enables fractional investment in AI startups using QUBE tokens. Designed as a deflationary token, QUBE is key to revolutionizing how AI startups raise funds and interact with their community. As the BNB chain gears up for a landmark upgrade, the surge in interest and investment from DeFi enthusiasts in QUBE is attributed to its unique features.\n\nThe enticing prospect of staking is among the key reasons driving the mounting interest in QUBE among DeFi fans. Participants gain access to a range of benefits, including the potential to earn rewards from the dedicated reward pool by staking QUBE DeFi tokens on the InQubeta platform. Not only does this contribute to securing the network and improving its performance, but it also supports the growth and success of AI technology startups. As more QUBE tokens are staked, the circulating supply decreases, potentially increasing the token's value over time.\n\nInQubeta's trending NFT marketplace catalyzes the projected value growth, further enticing DeFi lovers and investors. Through the marketplace, investment opportunities are minted into NFTs and fractionalized, allowing for flexible and budget-friendly investments while rewarding early backers. The marketplace presents a win-win scenario for AI startups and QUBE token holders. Startups gain access to a diverse range of investors in the InQubeta community. In contrast, investors can easily support projects they believe in, fostering a symbiotic ecosystem that benefits all parties involved.\n\nThe platform further entices investors by providing valuable services designed to nurture and support AI startups, which is why DeFi fans buy QUBE DeFi tokens in bulk. Mentorship and guidance from experienced industry professionals set the foundation for success. InQubeta's network of AI industry veterans offers invaluable insights to startups, helping them navigate the challenges of building and scaling their businesses effectively.\n\nAlso, the platform's marketing and branding support empowers startups to gain exposure and recognition. By tapping into InQubeta's extensive network of investors, industry professionals, and AI enthusiasts, these startups can build awareness, grow their network, and accelerate their growth and success within AI technology. This range of services further establishes InQubeta as the best crypto investment platform in the AI industry.\n\nBinance Chain (BNB) Mainnet: Introducing the \"ZhangHeng\" Upgrade and the BEP-255 Evolution Proposal\n\nBinance chain mainnet is preparing to introduce a groundbreaking feature that grants the blockchain the authority to pause the generation of new blocks. This implementation has a crucial caveat: it is only activated upon meeting specific conditions.\n\nOfficially known as the \"ZhangHeng\" upgrade, the forthcoming enhancement will take effect at block height 328,088,888. This hard fork upgrade will also introduce the BNB Evolution Proposal (BEP-255) to the ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the BNB chain prepares for a groundbreaking upgrade, the spotlight shines brightly on the InQubeta platform. With its innovative approach to AI startup investments, the allure of staking, and the power of its trending NFT marketplace, InQubeta has captured the attention of DeFi fans, investors, and AI enthusiasts. As the platform continues to disrupt the crypto industry and revolutionize AI startup fundraising, the projected surge in InQubeta's value appears well within reach. With the ongoing presale, you can be part of this innovative platform by purchasing the QUBE token.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says a major sell-off event is on the horizon for altcoins, but notes that leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) may be safe.\n\nIn a new strategy session, DataDash host Nicholas Merten tells his 511,000 YouTube subscribers that altcoins look primed for a sustained corrective move.\n\n\u201cNot only are altcoins at the moment looking like they\u2019re ready for a continued pullback, we\u2019re doing our due diligence, we\u2019re trying to find the projects we\u2019re interested in but at the same time, I\u2019m going to be honest with you guys, I do see the market continuing to correct.\u201d\n\nLooking at Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of crypto exchange Binance and currently the fifth-ranked digital asset, Merten says its price action could reveal what\u2019s next for the altcoin market at large.\n\nAccording to the crypto trader, BNB could witness a deep correction if it fails to hold the $30 billion level in terms of market cap.\n\n\u201cWe are basically trying to determine now that Binance [Coin], or BNB, has broken through this long-term trend line that it held since 2017, how low can things go? Can it hold here at around $30 billion?

Over the last more than a year, it has been building an ascending triangle. This is a bullish pattern where you have a flat range of resistance, ascending lows that line up, squeezing and coiling in price, usually to bounce to the upside.\n\nHowever, I want to make it clear that there\u2019s no guarantee of that as with all technical patterns, we\u2019re just simply working with what we have.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,883 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
