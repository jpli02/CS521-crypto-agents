        "content": "An Anglesey Air BnB which has its own private beach has been tipped as one of North Wales' best \"hidden gems\". The Cysgod Y Llanw holiday let has been described as a \"hideaway on one of Anglesey's quietest beaches\".\n\nThe peaceful cottage near Holyhead looks out onto the sandy shores of Porth Trefadog. The former farm outbuilding was converted by Deian and Ceri Williams, who have a close connection to the stunning location.\n\nThe couple, who live in Llanfairpwll with their children Aeron and Llyr, started the project in 2016 and have faced many hurdles during the build, including the sad passing of Deian's mum and younger brother. Despite the family's tragic loss, Deian says the project has brought the family closer together, giving them an \"everlasting link\" to his mum and brother.\n\nREAD MORE:Haven caravan park residents say fee hike can't be justified at 'run-down' site\n\nDeian, who grew up on his family's farm in Trefadog, said: \"We began the development of Cysgod Y Llanw back in 2016 and finally finished in October of last year. Sadly, during this time, I\u2019ve lost my mother and younger brother to cancer aged 59 and 30 respectively.\n\n\"What makes Cysgod Y Llanw so special to us is it gives us an everlasting link to my mother and brother despite their passing. Every time we spend the limited time we get here, due to the popularity of the property for holiday purposes to our guests, it feels so homely and that we are at peace here.\n\n(Image: Deian Williams) (Image: Deian Williams)\n\n\"Having the beach at the bottom of our garden is also magical, especially given we have young children and a dog. This is feedback we had off a number of our guests too - they feel at peace when they visit and don't want to leave.\"\n\nCysgod Y Llanw has its own private pathway onto the quiet sands of Porth Trefadog beach, which includes part of the Anglesey Coastal Path. The farm is one of the oldest houses on Anglesey at more than 700 years old.\n\nThe secluded beach has been dubbed a \"hidden gem\" thanks to its untouched golden sands. Deian said: \"The beach is a great combination of pebbles to start and sand thereafter.\n\n(Image: Deian Williams)\n\n(Image: Deian Williams)\n\n\"It's a beach that the public is welcome to but not a lot know it exists, except for the locals. It is officially part of the Anglesey coastal path too.\n\n\"The view is uninterrupted towards Holyhead port where you can enjoy the ships coming in and out, both from the beach and the corner window at Cysgod Y Llanw.\" He added: \"We are delighted to be able to share this piece of Anglesey with our many guests.\"\n\nYou can find out more about Porth Trefadog on Cysgod Y Llanw's Facebook page. You can also find information about booking a stay at the cottage here.\n\nREAD NEXT:"

        "content": "OnlyFans is the famous platform that allows users to follow content published by creators by paying them a subscription fee. To date, it is not known to have activated the ability to make or receive payments in crypto, although it has been talked about since 2021.\n\nThus it is not surprising that it does not even have its own token.\n\nThe OnlyFans (FANNED) crypto\n\nYet there is a token issued on BNB Chain called OnlyFans, and it has FANNED as its ticker.\n\nIt cannot be found on centralized exchanges, because it is a fake. However, you can find it on the Pancake Swap DEX, since it is indeed a token created on BNB Chain.\n\nThere are actually several tokens issued on BNB Chain called OnlyFans, all fakes, and all tradable on PancakeSwap.\n\nIt is not even easy to determine their market value, both because there are several tokens with the same name but different prices, and because the trading volume is very small.\n\nHowever, on PooCoin there is a chart showing the price of the FANNED token in BNB.\n\nIts website onlyfansbsc.io is offline, and on CoinMarketCap they describe it as a parody project of the popular adult entertainment website OnlyFans.\n\nIt also says that this meme coin was meant to be funny and to \u201cprovide laughter and joy to the holders,\u201d although it is not clear how.\n\nIt is also passed off as a form of protest against the modern adult entertainment industry that promotes the concept of objectified women. So it should provide memes and entertainment, but also stimulate reflection.\n\nIt also promises to provide great rewards to its owners in the form of BUSD. Better yet, they promised to hold contests with giveaways and even raise awareness about energy consumption that is causing a global climate crisis.\n\nFinally they reveal that the true purpose of this project would be found over time as the project itself grew.\n\nNow, however, the website is offline, and its market value has almost gone to zero.\n\nThe price of FANNED\n\nPooCoin\u2019s chart begins as far back as late November 2021, revealing that it is a fake token that has existed for more than a year.\n\nThe initial price was 0.003 thousandths of a dollar, but within ten days it made its all-time high at 0.837 thousandths, a gain of 27,000%.\n\nEvidently this was a pump-and-dump scheme, not least because three days after it peaked it had already collapsed to 0.034 thousandths of a dollar.\n\nSince then it has only fallen further, so much so that the following month the price was already back to 0.003 thousandths. It is currently at about 0.001 thousandths of a dollar, which is 66% lower than its initial value at the end of November 2021, and 99.88% below the highs of 9 December 2021.\n\nDespite this, it is still trading on Pancake Swap, although volumes have now become ridiculous.\n\nTrading volumes\n\nAt the time of the launch, daily trading volume was in the range of $77,000, rising to $127,000 the day after the launch.\n\nThen, while the pump was still going on, volumes had already dropped to $86,000, then collapsed to $16,000 five days after the price spike.\n\nAnother five days later they were down to $125, with a brief revival only at the end of December when for one day they exceeded $5,000 again.\n\nSince then the daily trading volume has hardly ever returned above $100, so much so that there have even been several days with zero trading volume due to the total absence of transactions.\n\nOnlyFans\u2019 crypto: fake or scam?\n\nIt is certain that this is a fake token using the OnlyFans name without any authorization or consent from the company.\n\nBut given the description they had given at launch, given the obvious pump-and-dump scheme, and given the fact that its creators have vanished, it actually looks a lot worse than just a fake: it looks a lot like the classic grab-and-run crypto scam, i.e., convincing unsuspecting speculators to buy the token at a high price by \u201cdumping it\u201d as the jargon goes, as soon as possible and then vanishing.\n\nThe token still exists, it is still exchangeable, but by now the project can be said to be over. Someone most likely made a profit on it, behind the backs of all those who believed it was serious."
