        "content": "This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and Binance Coin.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nYesterday, Ethereum exploded higher on the news of an imminent ETF by BlackRock. This made the price increase by an impressive 17% in the past seven days.\n\nThis marks a significant change in price action for ETH, which may challenge the dominance of BTC in the next few weeks. Moreover, the price is now found just under the key resistance at $2,150 in a large ascending triangle.\n\nIf ETH\u2019s price breaks above that level, then it may quickly rally much higher in a short amount of time. The second-largest cryptocurrency seems to have awakened now.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nXRP enjoyed a great week as well after booking a 10% increase. The price has now arrived at the 68 cents resistance and may enter a short pullback before attempting to go higher.\n\nThe support is found at 57 cents, and momentum is currently favoring buyers. Therefore, a deep pullback appears unlikely at this time.\n\nLooking ahead, the bias on XRP is bullish, and if the overall market continues to show such excitement, then this cryptocurrency should also perform well.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano had a fantastic week after it managed to increase by 17%, rivaling ETH\u2019s performance. In the process, ADA made a local high at almost 39 cents.\n\nThe current resistance is found at 38 cents, and the support is at 35 cents. Momentum continues to favor bulls, which so far have dominated in terms of volume.\n\nLooking ahead, ADA could soon visit 40 cents if the key resistance falls, which would be a key psychological level, but sellers could also return there.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana is the undisputed leader in the major altcoin space right now and booked an eye-popping 25% increase this week alone.\n\nIn the process, SOL also broke above $44, which was a key resistance, now turned into support. This breakout opens the way for this cryptocurrency to aim much higher.\n\nLooking ahead, Solana could continue moving to the next key level found at $67. To reach that, buyers have to sustain their dominance after closing three consecutive weekly candles in green.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance Coin finally managed to break the resistance at $230, which is now a key support. In the process, the price also increased by 10% this week.\n\nThe current resistance is at $265, and sellers may return there. Therefore, the uptrend potential right now is somewhat limited from its current price of $252.\n\nLooking ahead, BNB has a good chance to rally higher if it breaks above $265. If not, it could continue to range below the key resistance."

        "title": "Why Altcoins Like Cardano and Polygon Were Massive Winners This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The great crypto rally of late 2023 continued, thanks to momentum behind a certain financial instrument.\n\nThe seemingly unstoppable rise of cryptocurrencies continued this week, extending a big rally that stretches back to early October. Quite a few altcoins were swept up in the surge as major coins led the way.\n\nAmong the risers was Cardano (ADA 1.29%), with a nearly 18% increase according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Even more impressive was Polygon's (POLY) 26% pop. BNB (BNB -2.52%) and XRP (XRP 0.86%) didn't quite hit those highs but still managed decent gains of over 10% and nearly 9%, respectively. Continued good news was the flame that kept the rally alight.\n\nCrypto spot ETFs are on the way, hopefully\n\nIn this market, it's often one of the giants that leads the little guys along. This partially explains the rise of altcoins particularly at the end of the week.\n\nYou see, much of the bullishness with cryptocurrencies at the moment is due to investor excitement about spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If and when these receive regulatory approval as valid, investible securities, demand for their component coins and tokens should rise suddenly and dramatically.\n\nOn Thursday, large and influential financial services company BlackRock filed to list a spot Ethereum ETF on the Nasdaq. Does that sound familiar? It should, as the company previously moved the market with its attempt to bring a spot Bitcoin ETF to life.\n\nWhile there is currently a clutch of crypto ETFs available for investment these days, none invest in coins and tokens directly. The spot ETFs would function this way, and as such they would be more closely representative of actual coin and token prices than the currently available offerings. They'd also be quicker to buy, and easier to hold, than direct crypto investments.\n\nRecently the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), famously resistant to cryptocurrencies, suffered a legal setback in its fight against such assets.\n\nThis summer a District of Columbia appeals court ruled that the regulator was wrong to turn down Grayscale Investment's application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a -- you guessed it -- spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC subsequently decided not to appeal. Compounding that, the Commission this week reportedly launched fresh discussions with Grayscale about the process.\n\nThis understandably boosted optimism in the crypto community, and it was only compounded by BlackRock throwing its hat in the ring for that spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nImagining a spot altcoin ETF (or several)\n\nTrue, no one is yet concocting a spot Cardano or Polygon ETF (at least as far as we the public are aware). Yet if and when such financial instruments hit the market, at least a few of the prominent altcoins will form the core of such instruments. We can even imagine a general altcoin ETF or several prowling the market. Why not? There are obviously plenty of bulls who would consider plowing money into them."

        "content": "Interest in cryptocurrency has been on the rise as the year comes to an end. In the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, whales continue the accumulation of the ADA token.\n\nAt the same time, Binance Coin (BNB) is receiving a significant price boost as it sets its sights on $250. Meanwhile, NuggetRush (NUGX), an emerging P2E memecoin, is gearing up to see exponential growth in investor interest.\n\nSo, in this article, we will cover these interesting developments around Cardano, BNB, and NuggetRush, including why they are altcoins to watch.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX): Growing investor interest\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) is a project currently on the initial coin offering list but gearing up to become as popular as Cardano and BNB. It is currently seeing growing investor interest, evident in its raising of more than $300,000 in its ongoing presale. But what is this project all about, and what makes it unique?\n\nIt is a P2E memecoin, meaning it combines two of the most popular trends in the crypto landscape. That isn\u2019t all. It combines features of impact gaming as it aims to contribute to improving the standard of living of artisanal miners in developing countries.\n\nIf you are a game enthusiast, you will experience a thrilling gaming experience that involves gold mining. You can choose from characters in the game as you go on quests or partner with other players to collect rewards.\n\nThis project is in the second round of its presale and costs just $0.012 per token. According to experts\u2019 forecasts, the price will rise by 2,500% in 2023 amid increasing interest. If you wish to become an early member of this fast-growing community, click on the link below.\n\nCardano (ADA): Increasing Whale interest\n\nCardano (ADA) is one of the top altcoins on the market and, as a result, requires little to no introduction. However, for newcomers, Cardano is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. It allows the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It is also a top ten cryptocurrency by market capitalization, making it a key player in the crypto space.\n\nIt recently witnessed growing whale interest, which we believe is a bullish indicator. After all, whales have a keen eye for discovering profit potential. So, will we be seeing a significant rise in the price of Cardano? Well, the odds are great. Therefore, it is a compelling investment to consider now.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB): Significant price increase\n\nJust like Cardano, Binance Coin (BNB) is also a top coin, ranking among the top 5 cryptocurrencies. It is the native token of the Binance ecosystem, which includes the exchange, Binance Smart Chain, Trust Wallet, etc. In addition to this, BNB has important use cases like settling transaction fees, participating in exclusive token sales, and payment for goods and services.\n\nIt recently witnessed a price boost, with its next target being $250. The rise in the price of BNB can be linked to several factors. To begin, the overall market is experiencing a rally, which BNB is trading alongside. Also, investor confidence has been restored, which is playing a significant role in the rise in its price. Therefore, we believe it is one of the best coins to invest in.\n\nConclusion\n\nLarge-volume investors are currently showing interest in Cardano, which we believe to be a bullish indicator. In addition to this, BNB is receiving a price boost, and NuggetRush is set to see growing investor interest because of its blend of P2E and impact gaming. You can purchase the NuggetRush token by simply following the link below.\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"
