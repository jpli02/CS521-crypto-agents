        "title": "Halifax approves new short-term rental regulations starting in September - CBC.ca",
        "content": "Halifax has approved regulations for short-term rentals like Airbnbs, but are giving residents until Sept. 1 to adjust.\n\nDozens of people spoke on the proposed changes to rules around short-term rentals of 28 days or less at a crowded public hearing before Halifax regional council Tuesday night.\n\nOwners will be required to live in their rental property if they are in a residential zone, a staff report said. Those in mixed use or commercial zones anywhere in Halifax don't carry that requirement, but all will have to register with the municipality.\n\n\"There will be winners and there will be losers,\" said Coun. Shawn Cleary.\n\nAlthough council voted in December to delay any decision to April, they later revoked that direction and agreed to move ahead with a public hearing and a vote on the changes.\n\nThose in favour of regulation said they wanted to know who to go to with noise and garbage complaints, and that a revolving door of visitors has eroded community feeling.\n\nBrendan Smith of Dartmouth said he's the only long-term renter left in his three-unit building, with the others converted to short-term listings.\n\n\"These issues affect my neighbours as well, as our area has started to feel less like a community, and more like a hotel development,\" Smith said.\n\nSmith said he feels his housing situation is \"precarious\" as he's worried his landlord could find a reason to turn his unit into an Airbnb as well.\n\nMany, like Smith, said they hope homes can revert to long-term rentals given the province's housing crisis.\n\nBrendan Smith of Dartmouth speaks in favour of Halifax's proposed regulations on short-term rentals during a public hearing at Halifax City Hall on Tuesday night. (Haley Ryan/CBC)\n\nCouncillors have said they hope the changes cut down on so-called ghost hotels in residential areas where property owners who live elsewhere buy up apartments, evict tenants and turn the building into only short-term rentals.\n\nStaff said Tuesday that the vast majority of the Halifax region's roughly 2,000 listings \u2014 about 1,350 \u2014 are located in residential zones and will have to follow the new owner-occupied rule.\n\nBut staff said they don't know how many would turn into long-term rentals or be sold. Halifax's new regulations are more permissive than other cities in Canada, since they're not limiting the number of nights or bedrooms that can be rented.\n\nMichael Kabalen, executive director of the Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia, said the impact of the rules will be a \"mixed bag.\"\n\nWhile he said there may be more housing made available by the changes, it won't help people with lower incomes.\n\n\"The real solutions need to be purpose-built affordable housing either by government or by agencies like ours.\" Kabalen said.\n\nJoline Dorey of Dartmouth was one of many owners who told council they would not be converting their spaces into long-term rentals and felt like the regulations will be \"drastically impacting my family, for the benefit of no one.\"\n\nDorey, a single mom of two, said the new rules would likely mean she would sell her rental cottage to help make ends meet on their home where she also has a rental suite.\n\nJoline Dorey of Dartmouth says she uses the income of her two short-term rental listings to make ends meet for her and her two children. The new regulations would mean she has to sell her cottage, she said. (CBC)\n\n\"[Short-term rental] owners are not big corporations. We are Nova Scotians who are hard working and using our assets to supplement our income to survive these difficult times,\" Dorey said.\n\nProperty managers like Tiffany Westwood talked about how the new rules would lead to only wealthy people running short-term listings. Westwood said she runs her own small management company handling 11 units, and the new rules would likely shut down nine.\n\n\"Completely destroying my business and ruining my livability,\" she said.\n\nAvery Birch of the 365 Experience rental company said they have about 100 rentals in Halifax and rural areas like Lunenburg, and employ about 50 people.\n\nHe suggested the city add a new tax levy that would see all the funds go to building affordable housing.\n\n\"Maybe we can be part of the solution so it becomes an ecosystem in which we're feeding the solution we are looking for,\" Birch said.\n\nMarketing levy only for tourism\n\nAlthough recent provincial changes to Halifax Regional Municipality's charter allows it to raise the two per cent marketing levy on tourist accommodations to three per cent, and include short-term rentals, staff said that money can only be used for tourism. Currently 60 per cent of those funds go to Discover Halifax and the remaining goes to the city's special events reserve.\n\nOther Airbnb owners and property managers talked about how they provide a key service as transitional homes for people moving to Nova Scotia from other provinces, Ukrainian refugees, or tradespeople and paramedics in town for short visits.\n\n\"A lot of reports we have been getting from neighbours who feel unsafe with strangers in their community are often people who do not look like them,\" said Sid Kosatsky of the property management company Host Often.\n\nA Discover Halifax study presented to council Tuesday estimated that the changes could cut the inventory of short-term rentals in half, with 75,000 fewer rooms available annually. The most likely scenario estimated $49 million in lost economic activity.\n\nCoun. Waye Mason, left, and Coun. Lindell Smith at a 2018 city council meeting. Mason said Tuesday the changes have been discussed for years. (Robert Short/CBC)\n\nCoun. Waye Mason of Halifax South Downtown said while he can empathise with people faced with losing their livelihoods, the changes have been in the works for years. Council directed staff in September 2020 to look into making specific bylaw changes.\n\n\"This should not be news to anyone,\" Mason said.\n\nMason also said with a 0.7 vacancy rate in his district, if the changes released even 100 or 200 units \"that would be a huge deal for my residents and the pressure they're facing.\"\n\nCouncil eventually passed the regulations, with councillors Becky Kent, Trish Purdy and Shawn Cleary voting no.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES"

        "content": "Several projects and assets in the bitcoin and blockchain industries are aimed toward diverse aims. It's not uncommon to see programs that try to address similar problems.\n\nFor example, there are several cryptocurrency exchanges.

A cryptocurrency exchange may have an asset utilized for specific purposes, such as trading platform fee discounts on its connected exchange.\n\nThe Binance exchange's Binance Coin (BNB) is one such crypto exchange asset.\n\nIn this tutorial on \u2018What is Binance\u2019, you will explore its in-depth concepts and components in detail.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat Is Binance (BNB) Coin?\n\nOn the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, Binance Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency that may be used for trading and paying commissions.\n\nWith more than 1.4 million transactions per second as of January 2018, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world was the Binance Exchange.\n\nThis coin is limited to 200 million BNB tokens and runs on the Ethereum blockchain using the standard ERC 20 protocol.\n\nAs an incentive, Binance Coin users receive a reduction in transaction costs on the Binance Exchange.\n\nBNB can be traded or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and others.\n\nHow Does Binance Coin Work?\n\nLike other digital assets available on the market, the value of BNB changes as people use and trade it.\n\nBNB can be kept in suitable wallets purchased from cryptocurrency exchanges and delivered straight to others for payment or other uses. But there is a whole working initiative behind this process.\n\nBinance's layer-1 blockchain is merged to form the BNB Chain, previously the Binance Smart Chain and the Binance Chain.\n\nBinance designed the blockchain for best performance when it comes to trading on-chain when building the BNB chain, and Binance DEX, Binance's decentralized exchange (DEX), is based on this newly developed chain.\n\nFurthermore, BNB chain transactions are powered by the BNB gas token, which stands for \"Build and Build\" (previously known as Binance Coin).\n\nBNB beacon chain and BNB Smart Chain make up the BNB chain.\n\nThe former concerns BNB Chain governance, allowing BNB holders to vote and stake their coins.\n\nThen, it's a consensus layer that's compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine and has multi-chain hubs.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nBNB Burn\n\nBinance uses 20% of its quarterly profits to buy back and burn Binance Coins, completely destroying them.\n\nBinance has consistently performed quarterly burns, the most recent being on January 24, 2022, which was the 18th quarterly burn.\n\nEvery quarter, Binance will continue to burn BNB coin tokens until it has acquired and destroyed 100 million BNB coins, or half of the supply.\n\nBinance Coin's supply is reduced because of the procedure, and its rarity is affected, which could affect the asset's value.\n\nThe BNB Pioneer Burn Program is another program offered by Binance. It assesses cases when BNB holders have unrecoverably lost BNB and compensate them by reducing the amount from the next BNB burn.\n\nUses of Binance Coin\n\nTrading - Binance Coin can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies on various exchanges, depending on the exchange's regulations.\n\nTransaction fees on the Binance Exchange - Users can use BNB to pay for transactions on the Binance Exchange and earn a discount.\n\nCredit Card Payments - On Crypto.com, BNB can be used to pay crypto credit card bills.\n\nPayment Processing - Merchants can accept BNB as a form of payment, giving customers more options in terms of payment methods.\n\nBooking Travel Arrangements - BNB can also be used to book hotels and flights on certain websites.\n\nEntertainment - BNB is used for various purposes in the entertainment industry, from paying for virtual gifts to purchasing lottery tickets.\n\nInvestment - Binance Coin can be used to invest in stocks, ETFs, and other assets on various platforms.\n\nLoans and Transfers - BNB can be used as collateral for loans on some platforms.

Quick Transactions\n\nBNB gives you access to the platform's in-house matching engine, which can process up to 1.4 million orders per second when you trade on the exchange.\n\nFinding the appropriate transaction is always possible, and BNB makes it even easier and more reliable.\n\n2. Secure and Trustworthy\n\nBinance already has millions of cryptocurrency users and dealers who rely on the platform and believe in the security and protection aspects of the exchange.\n\nThe exchange uses a multi-cluster and multi-tier system framework and the Secure Assets Fund for Users (SAFU) to keep your funds safe.\n\n3.

There's no need to seek elsewhere.\n\n4. Trading Discount\n\nUsing BNB, you can also get a 50% discount on your trading charge.\n\nWith traditional payment methods, if you buy $10,000 worth of coins, you'll be charged $10. If you use BNB, though, the trading charge is cut in half, so you'll just have to spend $5.\n\n5.
