        "content": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - After the city of Hoover banned short term rentals in residential areas back in February, a local real estate broker started to think outside the box. That thinking led to the idea of a multistory boutique bed and breakfast, a hybrid of a hotel and Airbnb.\n\nThe project was recently approved by the Hoover Planning and Zoning Commission and will be up for vote by the Hoover City Council next month. The project is located in the Trace Crossings community near the Hoover Met.\n\nJordan Hosey, a real estate broker, wanted to provide traveling groups and families a place they could all stay together. It\u2019s a concept that is similar to Brock\u2019s Gap sister company Buck Creek BNB in Helena which is almost complete.

Traders would consider getting more exposure to BNB following the dip from the October highs if this support area holds.\n\nHowever, with the Relative Strength Index at 65.65 retreating into the neutral area from the overbought region, the path with the least resistance is likely to shift to the downside.\n\nAs for traders willing to bet on extended dips in BNB price, declines below the 100-day EMA at $225 would serve as confirmation. The 21-day EMA (red) would be in line to absorb the selling pressure and prevent losses likely to sweep liquidity at $200.\n\nNonetheless, investors should not fret keeping in mind that the crypto market structure has greatly improved in October. Hence, the drop to $225 could be the rally taking a breather before making a larger breakout to $240 and $250 short-term recovery targets.\n\nRelated Articles"
