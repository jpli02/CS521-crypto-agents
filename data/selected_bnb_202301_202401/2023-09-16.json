Users who have completed POA before this date in the Marrakesh-Safi Province area will each receive $100 in BNB directly to their Binance accounts.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that many users in the affected area may not have yet completed POA. Therefore, for any existing user who completes POA after September 9, 2023, and before September 30, 2023, we will donate $25 in BNB directly to their Binance account.\u201d\n\nActive transacting users across Morocco who are not in the affected area will each received $10 in BNB through airdrops, which is a term used for the distribution of free tokens or cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to Binance, around 70,000 Binance users living in Morocco will benefit from the airdrops starting September 12, 2023.\n\nIn the aftermath of natural disasters, people often lose access to traditional banking at the exact moment when extra funds are needed to help cover medical supplies, food, and other essential needs. Crypto transfers are now increasingly being used to deliver financial aid to disaster victims as they provide fast, low-cost, borderless, and transparent transactions.\n\n\u2013 Binance Charity\n\nBinance Charity also said it has launched a public donation address for anyone to contribute.\n\n\u201cWe will donate the total crypto amount received on this address to an authorized NGO (to be named soon) to help people in need. Donations to the Emergency Earthquake Appeal will be accepted in BNB, BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, or BUSD.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in response to the devastation caused by the recent floods in Libya, Binance will airdrop $100 in BNB to all Binance users who have completed Proof of Address (POA) in Libya.\n\nIdentification of the users will be based on POA completed before September 11 2023 across the country.\n\n\u201cUsers who have completed POA before September 11 2023 will each receive $100 in BNB directly in their Binance account. For any existing user who completes POA after 11th September 2023 and before 30th September 2023, we will donate $25 in BNB directly to your Binance account.
