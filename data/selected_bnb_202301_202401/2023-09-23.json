        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCardano, the decentralized proof-of-stake blockchain, is again making headlines, this time for achieving an impressive milestone of over five years of uninterrupted uptime.\n\nThe news of Cardano\u2019s remarkable uptime was brought to the forefront by a Twitter user named \u201cTGK,\u201d who took to social media to share the achievement. According to the pundit\u2019s tweet, Cardano boasts an impeccable uptime record of precisely 2,174 days, equivalent to an astonishing 5.95 years without a single instance of downtime.\n\nIn his tweet, Dave emphasized the resilience of Cardano, stating, \u201cBuilt to last, an uptime the largest service providers in the world cannot and will never come close to challenging.\u201d This sentiment resonates with Cardano enthusiasts worldwide, who have come to rely on the platform\u2019s unwavering stability.\n\nCardano\u2019s exceptional track record in maintaining continuous uptime can largely be attributed to its status as one of cryptocurrency\u2019s most actively developed blockchain networks. Earlier this week, on-chain analytics firm Santiment ranked Cardano among the top ten most developed chains over the past 30 days.\n\nCardano secured the third position on this list, trailing only the Polkadot and Kusama networks. Notably, the so-called \u201cEthereum killer\u201d garnered an impressive 3871 GitHub commits in the last 30 days, showcasing the community\u2019s dedication to ongoing development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano enthusiasts have more reasons to be excited as the blockchain hints at upcoming releases. After the release of Mithril, a stake-based signature protocol designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of node syncing in late July, the community is now looking forward to Midnight.\n\nEarlier this week, Cardano\u2019s Input Output Global (IOG) unveiled an exciting announcement regarding the forthcoming launch of Midnight, a privacy-focused sidechain set to debut on the DevNet in the near future.\n\nCardano\u2019s Web3 wallet, Lace, is also poised for significant advancements. The recent release of version 5.3.0 for Daedalus, a wallet closely integrated with Cardano, brings support for the new Project Catalyst registration process and enhances the stability of the exchange rate conversion feature. These updates demonstrate Cardano\u2019s commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.\n\nThat said, Cardano\u2019s exceptional accomplishments over the last half-decade have positioned it as a trailblazer, setting unprecedented benchmarks for stability and performance within the crypto industry. With exciting developments on the horizon, the prospects for ADA\u2019s price recovery exceptionally well in the next bull run are exceedingly promising.\n\nAt press time, the cryptocurrency traded at $0.246 after a 0.49% drop over the past 24 hours."

        "title": "'Sister Wives': Everything You Need to Know About Meri Brown's Move Back to Utah - Showbiz Cheat Sheet",
        "content": "Meri Brown's move to Parowan, Utah, will be covered in the upcoming episode of 'Sister Wives.' That move happened long ago, but just how long ago did she move states?\n\nIn the upcoming episode of Sister Wives, Meri Brown will reveal to Robyn Brown that she is planning to move her business to Parowan, Utah. In a sneak peek for the upcoming episode, Meri reveals that she intends to spend most of her time in Utah since there is no movement on the reconciliation front with Kody Brown. Despite fans seeing the action now, the footage is quite old. Meri has long since moved away. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Meri\u2019s move to Utah.\n\nWhere in Utah is Meri Brown living?\n\nBefore the Brown family moved to Flagstaff, Arizona, Meri Brown purchased Lizzie\u2019s Heritage Inn, a bed and breakfast, in Parowan, Utah. Several episodes of Sister Wives focused on Meri\u2019s desire to buy the property and the pushback she received from the rest of the Brown family. Meri eventually purchased the inn without help from Kody and her sister wives. The decision was a good one. Meri is the sole owner of the property.\n\nThe inn is located in Parowan, Utah, a town of 3,000. While it\u2019s considered relatively rural, Parowan is known for its festivals and outdoor activities. The inn is close to several well-known ski attractions. While Christine Brown also lives in Utah, she lives in Lehi, several hours away from Parowan. Christine and Meri do not maintain a friendship now that they\u2019ve both left Kody Brown.\n\nWhen did she officially give up her Flagstaff rental?\n\nWhile Meri told Robyn Brown she was planning to move her business to Utah, she never said she was leaving Flagstaff for good. In the sneak peek, she told Kody\u2019s only remaining wife that she would be spending most of her time in Utah but wasn\u2019t planning to stay away from Flagstaff for good. Meri apparently kept a rental property in the state for at least another year.\n\nMeri Brown | TLC/YouTube\n\nAccording to several reports, the rental property Meri was residing in was available for rent as of April 2023. According to InTouch Weekly, the owner was hoping to get $5,800 per month for the property. A rental listing noted that the home would be available for move-in after May 15.\n\nConsidering the listing, Meri likely completely vacated the property sometime in March 2023. That doesn\u2019t mean she was spending much time there in the months prior. In fact, Meri was the one wife who never seemed to make Flagstaff her home despite maintaining a legal address there.\n\nWas Meri living in Utah for a while before the official announcement was made?\n\nMeri officially moved her business and gave up her Flagstaff rental in 2023. Still, Sister Wives viewers suspect Meri had been spending much more time away from Flagstaff than in it for many years before the official move. Meri left Flagstaff and resided in Utah following her mother\u2019s death in March 2021. Before her death, Bonnie Ahlstrom Barber served as the property\u2019s innkeeper.\n\nMeri stayed at the inn for several months to get things back up and running. She eventually traveled back to Flagstaff, but she never seemed to truly buy into the idea of Arizona as her home base. Meri\u2019s social media activity shows her traveling extensively. Almost none of her photos from the last four years show her in Flagstaff."
