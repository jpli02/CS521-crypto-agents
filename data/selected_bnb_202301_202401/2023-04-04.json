        "title": "PancakeSwap Launches version 3 on BNB Chain & Ethereum - CryptoTvplus",
        "content": "The leading decentralized exchange on BNB Chain, PancakeSwap has released Version 3 of its AMM DEX on the Ethereum and BNB Chain network.\n\nAccording to the exchange\u2019s developers, the updated platform would deliver improved profits for liquidity providers and the lowest rates for on-chain trades among peers like SushiSwap and Uniswap.\n\nThe upgrade to PankcakeSwap V3 introduces features that will upscale the platform\u2019s capital efficiency. They include enabling liquidity providers to focus their capital on smaller price ranges, a characteristic that leads to better fee earnings from the same amount of deposits.\n\nPancakeSwap V3 offers four trading charge tiers; 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, and 1%. V2 only offered one tier, which was 0.25%. Each fee tier can have a liquidity pool for each token pair, with asset pairs tending to gravitate toward the fee tier with the best incentives for both liquidity providers and traders.\n\nBy encouraging the largest amount of liquidity from Liquidity Providers, this strategy aims to strike a balance between traders paying the lowest fee tier and other participants.\n\nTwo additional features will be added to PancakeSwap V3 in the future: a position management function and the V3 \u201cVIP\u201d trading rewards program.\n\nThe VIP program is a tiered structure that rewards traders for their trading volume with special advantages including the potential to receive a 5% trading fee rebate \u2013 which may encourage more platform activity and increase PancakeSwap\u2019s revenue.\n\nUsing the \u201cposition manager\u201d feature, traders can seamlessly deposit liquidity and gradually optimize that position based on costs and benefits. By doing away with the necessity for manual calculations for third-party integrations, the tool enables users to automatically alter their positions and earn fee incentives while remaining within bounds.\n\nRead also;"

        "content": "PancakeSwap V3 will drastically reduce fees compared to V2.\n\nCAKE\u2019s TVL remained stagnant, but metrics and indicators looked bullish.\n\nPancakeSwap [CAKE] announced the launch of its much-awaited PancakeSwap V3, bringing several new changes to the table. The DEX\u2019s official tweet on 3 April confirmed that V3 was live on both BNB Chain and Ethereum [ETH].\n\n1/14 ?GM ev3ryone! The anticipated #PancakeSwapv3 is now LIVE on both BNB Chain and Ethereum!? ?Upgrade offers:\n\n?Lowest fees in the industry\n\n?Increased fee earnings for liquidity providers\n\n?\ufe0fNew tools for seamless user experience Read more : https://t.co/l7GQVxqVC3 pic.twitter.com/5G9TnFzxOb \u2014 PancakeSwap?Ev3ryone's Favourite D3X (@PancakeSwap) April 3, 2023\n\nRead PancakeSwap\u2019s [CAKE] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAll you need to know about PancakeSwap V3\n\nThe official announcement mentioned several new features and changes that PancakeSwap\u2019s V3 brought with it. For instance, V3 will offer considerably lower fees\u2014up to 25 times lower compared to the previous version.\n\nAs noted earlier, CAKE\u2019s revenue had been on a declining trend. V3\u2019s lower fee could attract new users, which could then result in an increase in the network\u2019s revenue.\n\nApart from low fees, another key aspect of PancakeSwap V3 is capital efficiency. By selecting a specific price range when providing liquidity, liquidity providers could now \u201cconcentrate\u201d their capital into smaller price intervals with V3. It was also interesting to note that PancakeSwap V3 was built on top of Uniswap V3 with added refinements.\n\nWill V3 propel MATIC?\n\nThough the update looks promising, PancakeSwap\u2019s network value does not seem to have been affected positively yet. This was evident from a look at DeFiLlama\u2019s data, which pointed out CAKE\u2019s stagnant TVL. However, the V3 launch brought hope for a change in the coming weeks, as it might help increase CAKE\u2019s TVL.\n\nBefore the launch, CAKE\u2019s price was under the bears\u2019 influence. However, things seemed to have started to change as CAKE\u2019s declining momentum slowed down. According to CoinMarketCap, CAKE was trading nearly 0.4% lower than yesterday. At the time of writing, it was valued at $3.68 with a market capitalization of over $673 million.\n\nThanks to the relatively better price action, CAKE\u2019s MVRV ratio also recovered slightly on 4 April. Whales\u2019 interest in CAKE also increased as whale transaction counts spiked lately. CAKE\u2019s volume increased considerably, reflecting investors\u2019 interest in trading the token. Another positive development was that CAKE\u2019s weighted sentiments drifted up swiftly, which indicated the crypto community\u2019s confidence in the token.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 CAKEs worth today?\n\nGoing forward\n\nThe effects of V3\u2019s launch might soon be reflected in CAKE\u2019s chart, as suggested by a few market indicators. The MACD displayed a slight bullish crossover, suggesting a price hike in the near term. PancakeSwap\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a slight uptick and was headed towards the neutral mark, which looked bullish.\n\nHowever, nothing can be said with utmost certainty as CAKE\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) went down and was resting below the 50 mark."

        "content": "Community governance has given a tentative thumbs up to the deployment of Aave\u2019s borrowing and lending protocol on two additional chains, with a third potentially on the way.\n\nRecent \u201ctemperature check\u201d votes provided overwhelming support for adding Aave\u2019s latest version 3 to the newly launched Ethereum layer-2 rollup, Polygon zkEVM, as well as to Binance\u2019s BNB Chain, an alternative layer-1. Both chains employ dapps using the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM).\n\nGovernance token (AAVE) holders signaled nearly unanimous support for the expansion plans put forward by Marc Zeller, an independent Aave DAO delegate with the Aave-Chan Initiative. Zeller\u2019s own vote in favor represents over 40% of the vote total in each case. Of his stake, around 95% of the delegated AAVE comes from 190 individual holders, Zeller told Blockworks.\n\nProponents will eventually need to submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to pave the way for a formal on-chain vote before any such deployment will actually occur.\n\nThe latest proposal, posted Monday, could also add Starknet to the growing list of chains expected to sport an Aave implementation. The active vote for this proposal runs until April 10.\n\nAlthough Polygon\u2019s zkEVM mainnet only officially launched on March 27, Aave has already notched 6 months of experience on the network through its testnet, which became available in October 2022. According to the proposal, the deployment \u201cpresents an opportunity for Aave Governance to establish a strategic presence on this new network early on,\u201d adding \u201cAave has a history of pioneering in new frontiers, starting with the Polygon & Avalanche V2 deployment in 2021.\u201d\n\nThe protocol is currently active on seven chains in total, although around 85% of its $5.68 billion in total value locked (TVL) remains on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nBNB Chain \u2014 formerly known as Binance Smart Chain (BSC) \u2014 registers almost three times the number of active users as Ethereum, despite a TVL of 17% that of Ethereum\u2019s total.\n\nThe two most popular DeFi protocols on BNB Chain are forks of Ethereum stalwarts; PancakeSwap launched as a clone of Uniswap V2, and still predominates in the DEX space on BNB Chain \u2014 although it will soon face competition from Uniswap itself \u2014 and developers forked borrowing and lending protocol Venus from Aave\u2019s rival Compound in 2020.\n\nDeFi developers and their Ethereum-centric communities have been slow to embrace BNB Chain, which is \u201cless decentralized by any metric,\u201d Zeller told Blockworks. Even so, he said he advocates for a \u201cpragmatic approach\u201d that offers options to users.\n\n\u201c[A]fter years, the BNB ecosystem [has] shown resilience and [product-market fit], it\u2019s time to break the taboo,\u201d Zeller said.\n\nAave is also gearing up to launch its own stablecoin, GHO, which launched on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet back in February. Zeller added there\u2019s a strategic aspect to the BNB Chain expansion in particular, owing to the recent collapse in market share of the company\u2019s Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin.\n\n\u201cBUSD left some void in \u2018native\u2019 on-chain stablecoins,\u201d Zeller said.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Puffverse Officially Launches PuffGo Game for BNB Chain-Based Puff NFTs - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "New York, NY, April 04, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Puffverse , the company behind the adorable Puff NFTs that were introduced late last year on BNB Chain, has recently rolled out the official version of its PuffGo game after months in beta mode. This launch came a few months after the company launched its original Puff Genesis NFT collection and the Puff Football NFTs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPuffGo is an on-chain multiplayer royale game, with several level themes and gameplay modes that offer players a choice of matchups from solo to multiplayer. \u201cPuffGo\u2019s launch is just the first step in our comprehensive plan to connect Web 3 play-to-earn oriented players with the more conventional Web 2 traditional gamers and to bridge Web3 gaming with the metaverse and the era of user-driven content,\u201d the company said in a statement about the recent launch.\n\nWhat is Puffverse ?\n\nPuffverse was first introduced to the public in late 2022, with the launch of minting for Puff Tickets. The team then introduced its inaugural collection of 2,500 NFTs, most of which went to the lucky winners of its free mint lottery event. The NFTs, called Puff Genesis, belong to five different character types, and each NFT asset is unique with a random combination of eight parts.\n\nAccording to its website, Puffverse is a \u201cmulti-end interactive universe that uses characters in the form of NFT assets for multiple scenarios.\u201d The company identified four main products:\n\n\u25cf PuffGo, a casual multiplayer royale game\n\n\u25cf PuffTown, a Web 3 control panel for all Puffverse-related products\n\n\u25cf PuffLand, a user-generated content platform for creating games without the need for technical knowledge\n\n\u25cf PuffWorld, a user-generated content platform for creating 3D metaverse that features a decentralized ID system and SocialFi, Puffverse\u2019s take on socially-driven DeFi.\n\nThe Puffverse has since introduced alpha and beta versions of PuffGo and PuffTown. The team also launched two more limited-edition versions of its Puff NFTs: Puff Football NFTs, and Puff New Year NFTs, which debuted as part of a Lunar New Year campaign for the Puffverse community. All of these NFTs come in the form of one of the five characters in the game\u2019s story: Patty the dinosaur, Claude the cloud, Ashe the shooting star, Bill Duck, and Pop the fish with legs.\n\nAfter launching PuffGo, Puffverse says that it plans to introduce new features for PuffGo and PuffTown in Q2 of this year. Later on, the team set its sights on creating PuffLand in Q3 and PuffWorld in Q4.\n\nWhat to Expect from PuffGo\n\n\n\n\n\nPuffGo is a competitive gaming App where players join in many types of casual games such as obstacle courses, races, battle royales, mazes, and more. Players collect game characters with different appearances, personalities, abilities, and costumes, and these characters will have varying advantages based on the gameplay modes they are in.\n\nIn Web 2 field, Stumble Guys and Fall Guys are the competitors of PuffGo. They are excellent party games and have high daily revenue, but PuffGo is not just a game but a MetaFi project, and it is only a small part and the appetite of Puffverse . The focus is on PuffLand and PuffWorld.\n\nUnlike in PuffGo\u2019s alpha and beta versions, where only Puff NFT holders can play the game, the official version of the app allows even non-NFT holders to play. Even without a Puff NFT, users will still receive coins by practicing skills in PuffGo, particularly at the beginner-friendly Entry Level. The game also features High Level and Advanced Level modes for more experienced gamers. In-game coins are needed to access High Level, while users need to own at least 1 Puff NFT and use it to acquire Free Chances to access the Advanced Level.\n\nThere are different rewards that correspond to PuffGo\u2019s game levels. In-game (off-chain) coins can be earned at all levels and used to access High Level games. Winning in High Level gives players a chance to earn an Egg that can hatch into a Puff General NFT, which comes with a one-time endowment of Free Chances that can be used to access Advanced Level games. At the Advanced Level, players earn Rank Points in the form of vePUFF, based on their in-game performance. In this mode, higher rank and vePUFF earned translate to opportunities to earn more, in the form of in-game rewards and the PUFF crypto token when it eventually launches.\n\nIf players own non-General PUFF NFTs, they also earn Free Chances each game season (every 14 days) in PuffGo. Players can also purchase Passes in PuffTown App to get more entry times to the Advanced Level.\n\nWith this system in place, PuffGo allows non-NFT holders to play their way into earning an NFT, albeit with different perks from the Genesis, Football, or New Year versions of Puff NFTs. PuffGo also incentivizes players based on their in-game skills, a principle that Puffverse calls Skill to Earn. It is also a great way to welcome the large user base from the Web 2 field to enter the crypto world.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Makes Puffverse Different?\n\nUnlike other traditional GameFi projects, the team thinks the P2E model will likely fail because only early investors can earn huge rewards, whereas late investors' assets will be damaged. Skill-to-earn will come with a Rank system, as it mentioned above, where users get to compete with each other, and the top ranks will get rewards. So, instead of P2E, Skill-to-Earn is more like a marketing campaign and incentive periodically. The main tokenomic focuses on PuffTown, PuffLand, and PuffWorld. Play-to-Own will come with vePUFF, whereas all output will be in the form of vePUFF instead of PUFF itself. vePUFF has a strong DeFi feature that can earn from the protocol itself (eg. it shares a portion of protocol income with vePUFF holders).\n\nSkill to Earn is one of the two Web3 gaming concepts that Puffverse is introducing, the other one being Play to Own. In the PuffGo game, Skill to Earn means players use their skills to get more rewards, while Play to Own allows non-NFT holders to play their way into owning a Puff NFT.\n\nWith its system of entertaining and rewarding both Web3 and non-Web 3 players, PuffGo seeks to bridge traditional gaming with Web 3 gaming. But beyond these principles and systems, PuffGo aims to be a fun, exciting game that appeals to everyone and serves as a fine addition to the roster of Web3 games that use BNB Chain.\n\nMeanwhile, Puffverse \u2019s roadmap for its products indicates that Web3 gaming is the starting point for the 3D metaverse that plans to build out before the end of this year. For people who are interested in the game and what the future brings for Puffverse and its community, they can download PuffGo via the App Store/TestFlight, Google Play Store, and Xiaomi\u2019s GetsApp."
