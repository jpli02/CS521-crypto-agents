        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTG.Casino, an upcoming crypto casino powered by Telegram, is elated to announce its ongoing presale has surpassed the $500,000 mark nearly a month after launch.\n\nAccording to the team, the token presale has seen significant investor traction and is soon approaching the $1 million soft cap mark. At the time of writing, the platform had sold over $690k tokens abbreviated as $TGC, the TG.Casino Token is currently available to purchase for $0.125.\n\n$TGC is an ERC-20 token designed for the TG.Casino ecosystem. There are a total of $100 million TGC tokens, with 40 million being allocated for the presale. For the presale, the team has set the minimum purchase at 100 tokens. Note, that the presale will be open until the hard cap is reached which has been set at $5 million.\n\nSince 2017, the crypto casino market has proliferated, and the latest figures show the crypto casino market is now valued at $250 Million. Seeking to become more than just a casino platform, TG.Casino is creating an ecosystem that gives back to its players through constant rewards. The Casino hopes to leverage its native token, $TGC to help achieve this vision.\n\nHolders of the token will enjoy numerous benefits, including being able to generate staking rewards and earn a share of casino profits through the buyback feature once it is launched\u2014notably, the TG.Casino staking mechanism currently has an APY of over 737%. The mechanism also allows token buyers to add their $TGC tokens to the staking pool and generate an APY. This means that the buyer will continue to accrue tokens as the presale continues. Eventually, the APY will reduce as the team locks more tokens into pools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, buyers who choose to stake their tokens at this early stage will get the opportunity to share in daily profits once the casino is up and running. The profit sharing will be done through a buyback system, allowing token holders to earn more. Reportedly, the buyback mechanism takes a step further to add a burn mechanism that will see 40% of the buyback tokens taken out of the supply.\n\nWhat sets TG.Casino, apart from other crypto casinos, is its integration of Telegram to its design. The casino plans to utilize powerful Telegram bots to offer users an enhanced customer experience. These bots will make it easier for players to enjoy the various games and gambling opportunities.\n\nTG.Casino users will enjoy instant registration free from the KYC process. However, the casino will recognize users\u2019 phone numbers as unique references to each player through telegram."

        "title": "Neutron (NTRN) crypto trading arrives on Binance - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The crypto exchange Binance recently announced the launch of the Neutron (NTRN) crypto exchange on its platform, accompanied by a launchpool that will give users the chance to earn a small annuity for the next 20 days.\n\nThe green light has been given to trade NTRN, which can be exchanged for BTC, BNB and USDT.\n\nIs this a new gem, or will the coin and its associated project soon be forgotten by the crypto community?\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details together.\n\nBinance Launches Crypto Neutron (NTRN) on its Platform and Announces Launchpool Details\n\nCrypto exchange Binance has officially opened its doors for trading the Neutron coin (NTRN). The announcement, released this morning, will allow its users to trade the cryptocurrency using BTC, BNB or USDT as counterparties.\n\nThe cryptocurrency will be followed by the \u2018seed tag\u2019, which identifies new projects listed on Binance that are associated with high volatility. It should also be noted that withdrawals are already available for individuals who prefer to hold cryptocurrency in non-custodial wallets.\n\nWithin 48 hours of Neutron\u2019s actual launch, the exchange will make the same crypto available as a lending asset by adding the NTRN/USDT margin pair in the \u201cIsolated Margin\u201d section.\n\nA large following is expected, considering that Neutron is one of the best projects in the Cosmos ecosystem. As soon as Binance made the announcement, NTRN spiked 45% to a local high of $0.53 before pulling back slightly.\n\nThe token supply is set at 1 billion units and has a fully diluted market cap of over $450 million. Beware of volatility in the early hours of trading, which could be dangerous for newbies who do not know how to manage the risk involved in this particular case.\n\nTo support the launch of the innovative crypto, Binance revealed the accompanying launch pool, as it often does when listing a token in the \u2018innovation zone\u2019.\n\nAll holders of BNB, TUSD and FDUSD will be able to lock their coins for 20 days and receive a return directly in Neutron (NTRN).\n\nSpecifically, there will be 16,000,000 NTRN as an incentive for BNB holders and 4,000,000 NTRN for TUSD and FDUSD holders. All returns will be distributed on an hourly basis and can be claimed at any time.\n\nThis is great news for BNB holders who will be able to recoup their investment without taking on too much risk. The launch pool will officially begin at 02:00 Italian time this evening and will run until the end of the day on 30th October.\n\nWhat is Neutron?\n\nThe Neutron crypto project (NTRN), recently launched by Binance, is a blockchain network designed to embed smart contracts on Cosmos using CosmWasm (Cosmos WebAssembly), a library that provides a set of modular codes needed to build the chain.\n\nNeutron was built using the Cosmos SDK operating framework, simplifying the initial build process. Service provider Cosmos Hub initiated an on-chain vote in May to assess whether it was appropriate to launch Neutron on Replicated Security (RS).\n\nFollowing a series of tests and the implementation of a number of modules, the Cosmos community unanimously approved the project, with 90 per cent of voters supporting the proposal, only one per cent against and nine per cent abstaining.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Replicated Security (RS) is a paradigm that new chains orbiting the IBC can use to improve their security by simply building a dapp on top of the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nNeutron is the first consumer chain to launch on RS, and for this reason it has earned the respect of Binance, which first invested in the project by funding it with $10 million and then officially launched the NTRN token on its own platform, helping to introduce crypto to the public.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of this new project is the ability to offer customisable interchain queries, allowing developers to easily retrieve data across the entire interchain zone.\n\nGiven the strong development that the Cosmos universe is experiencing, as evidenced by the positive feedback from insiders who attended the Cosmoverse event held a few days ago in Istanbul, we believe that Neutron is likely to be quite successful in the coming years."

        "content": "In the early days of cryptocurrency, creating a new token was a daunting task, often requiring the development of an entirely new blockchain or a Bitcoin fork.\n\nHowever, Ethereum revolutionized this landscape by transforming blockchain technology into a versatile development platform. The introduction of the ERC-20 token model provided a fundamental framework for crafting new cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolved, innovative projects emerged, each with unique blockchain technology. One such project is the BNB Smart Chain (BSC), which introduced its token standard, BEP-20.\n\nWith the emergence of the BEP-20 standard, the demand for wallets that support it obviously grew.\n\nSo, in this article, we\u2019ll explore the top BEP20 wallets available in 2024 and provide essential insights. Let\u2019s get started!\n\nWhat is BEP20? Binance Smart Chain Explained\n\nThe BEP-20 (or BEP20, an acronym that stands for Binance Smart Chain Evolution Proposal) is a token standard developed by the Binance crypto exchange and operates on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and can be seen as an expansion of the widely-used ERC-20 standard on Ethereum.\n\nIt serves as a set of guidelines for tokens in this blockchain, specifying how they can be utilized, who has the authority to use them, and other regulations governing their functionality.\n\nFollowing the BEP-20 token standards, people can easily create new tokens on the BNB Smart Chain. This process is simple and doesn\u2019t require advanced programming skills, which is a significant advantage. Developers don\u2019t need to build a new blockchain from scratch, and they aren\u2019t limited to the Ethereum Token Standard.\n\nNotably, the BEP-20 standard is not only inspired by but also fully interoperable with the ERC-20 standard.\n\nSome examples of BEP20 standard tokens are BNB, PancakeSwap, Binance USD, SafeMoon, and others.\n\nWhat is a BEP20 Wallet?\n\nA BEP20 wallet is a wallet that allows you to manage BEP20-compliant tokens. In order to store and manage coins from the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain, users need a compatible cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nThese wallets offer a secure means for users to store, send, and receive BEP-20 tokens, much like Ethereum wallets facilitate the management of ERC-20 tokens.\n\nThey are crucial for individuals seeking to participate in activities involving tokens and decentralized applications (DApps) on the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nHow BEP20 Wallet Works?\n\nA BEP20 wallet functions much like other crypto wallets. When you create a BEP20 wallet, you receive both private and public keys. The private key is a secret code granting access to your wallet, while the public key is used to receive BEP20 tokens.\n\nThe primary role of a BEP20 wallet is to store, send, and receive BEP-20 tokens. To achieve this, you generate a unique BEP20 wallet address consisting of alphanumeric characters. It\u2019s crucial to remember that each BEP-20 wallet address is exclusive and should remain confidential.\n\nOnce you have a BEP-20 wallet address, you can easily transfer BEP-20 tokens to and from the wallet. To send tokens, enter the recipient\u2019s BEP-20 wallet address in the wallet\u2019s send function. Specify the number of tokens you want to send and confirm the transaction.\n\nTop BEP20 Wallets: Best BEP20 Wallet Binance Smart Chain in 2023\n\nNow that you have a good grasp of the fundamentals, let\u2019s explore the top 6 BEP-20 wallets for you to consider.
