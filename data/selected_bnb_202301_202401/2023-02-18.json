        "content": "If you\u2019re like other crypto traders on the coin market, you\u2019ll be interested in making plenty of profit from your trading activities. However, it\u2019s easier said than done. There are hundreds of crypto tokens in the coin market. Each of them offers you a different amount of profit. While you could earn double your capital by purchasing some tokens, others may offer exponential growth. But how would you identify these tokens? That\u2019s where we come in.\n\nThis piece will reveal the crypto tokens that offer you the best chance of earning up to 7x your capital. We\u2019ll look at the essential features of The Sandbox (SAND), Binance Coin (BNB), and Dogetti (DETI).\n\nThe Sandbox: Metaverse Meets Crypto\n\nThe Sandbox is a metaverse-inspired token designed to ensure users have access to the digital world. The Sandbox is closely related to Decentraland, and many people have kept both coins in the same category. However, The Sandbox is exciting in its own right.\n\nThe Sandbox is based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. This cryptocurrency is designed to allow users to create a custom experience for others. This experience may be in the form of an edited digital location or game. Three main parts make up Sandbox - VoxEdit, Game Maker, and Marketplace. Each of these parts has its special tools that will allow users to create unique experiences. When you\u2019re done with your creation, you\u2019re expected to sell it to other users.\n\n$SAND is the native currency of this cryptocurrency platform. You\u2019ll use SAND to purchase items on this platform and make in-game purchases. Because of SAND\u2019s unique utility, many traders are interested in it.\n\nBinance Coin: The Token Powering The Number 1 Exchange\n\nBinance coin is one of the most promising crypto tokens out there. There are many interesting things about this crypto token. To start with, it\u2019s the native currency for the Binance exchange platform. On Binance, you can trade in different types of cryptocurrencies. Binance is considered by many to be the top crypto exchange worldwide because of its massive number of users and a lineup of crypto tokens. This cryptocurrency is represented as BNB.\n\nBinance coin is the cryptocurrency that powers the platform. It\u2019s paid as transaction fees for the transfer of tokens from one user or wallet to another. When BNB was initially created, it was hosted on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, but after some time, this blockchain became unable to hold the activities that occurred on this exchange.\n\nDogetti: The Next Meme Coin To Emulate Dogecoin\u2019s Bull Run?\n\nDogetti is one of the most interesting cryptocurrencies to make it to the coin market in recent times. This cryptocurrency stands out from many alternatives in the meme sector because it has utility. It\u2019s unlike anything you\u2019d expect from a meme coin. The developers of this token have taken their time to create a masterpiece that will send shockwaves through the meme sector and the coin market at large.\n\nThe first interesting thing you need to know about this token is that it\u2019s created based on the Shiba Inu dog found on Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. However, its developers have opted to add a mafia touch to it. This creates a unique sense of design in work. The developers of this token have announced from the early stages that they will add utility to their project. They will create a token exchange platform known as DogettiSwap. Other decentralized exchanges, including UniSwap and SushiSwap, will inspire this exchange. UniSwap powers DogettiSwap. Therefore, there\u2019s plenty of liquidity to go around.\n\nDETI is the native currency that powers this cryptocurrency project. You\u2019ll need DETI tokens to join this new crypto family. Every user part of this project will receive immense profits from the ecosystem. Use code WISEGUY25 for a 25% bonus when purchasing in the presale!\n\nDon\u2019t Forgetta \u2018Bout It! For All Things Dogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_"

        "content": "Ethereum scaling solution zkSync has started its next development phase, \u201cfair onboarding alpha,\u201d enabling some registered projects to deploy on the mainnet. Also, it has rebranded its previous network, zkSync 2.0, to zkSync Era.\n\nZkSync is releasing its version of zkEVM, a ZK-Rollup Layer 2 scaling solution compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The project was exclusively introduced in its \u201cbaby alpha\u201d phase for internal usage in October.\n\nThe wait is over. All aboard zkSync Era\u220e Mainnet! Today, Ethereum\u2019s first zkEVM is: \u2022 Opening mainnet to builders \ud83e\udd73\n\n\u2022 Adopting a brand new name \ud83c\udf88\n\n\u2022 Open-sourcing its entire codebase \ud83c\udf86https://t.co/PoZeliPU8t 1/8 \u2014 zkSync\u220e (@zksync) February 16, 2023\n\nAfter this phase, the network was reborn in an event known as regenesis. This takes into consideration modifications to the code as a consequence of audits. Now, the project is in its second phase, the fair onboarding alpha.\n\nDuring this alpha phase of onboarding, registered projects can deploy and test their apps on zkSync Era, with token bridging enabled for testing and deployment purposes. However, the mainnet will remain inaccessible to end users.\n\nThe team noted that ongoing investments in audits and bug bounty programs will continue to ensure the platform\u2019s security. The network will be available to all projects and users when this phase ends.\n\nThis comes after zkSync rival Polygon recently announced plans to release its zkEVM network in March.\n\nLayer 2 projects such as Polygon, Starknet, zkSync, and Scroll have been fighting intensely over the last year to build a ZK-based Layer 2 that can natively serve Ethereum applications. Although these projects have yet to launch a product for public consumption, that might change in the coming months, with zkEVMs from Polygon and others like zkSync poised to go online. Also, Matter Labs is anticipated to unveil a new road map shortly."
