        "content": "A quarterly report published on Thursday showed that Binance\u2019s native network, BNB Chain, dominated about 46.75% of smart contract shares in this year\u2019s second quarter. The data collected between April and June 2023 displayed BNB Chain\u2019s increasing number of verified smart contracts per month amidst the bear market.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s daily active users (DAU) also reached a high of 1.2 million in the quarter, keeping its position as the most-used network for smart contract verification. The report also showed that the Binance Coin Chain verifies an average of 5,000 smart contracts weekly.\n\nThe analysis contained a month-to-month breakdown of the number of verified smart contract activities on top networks like Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Fantom, Avalanche, Optimisms, and Arbitrum. Smart contract verification is the process of matching a smart contract source to its on-chain bytecode.\n\nGrowth Amidst Market Uncertainties\n\nThe BNB Chian smart contract verification has consistently grown amidst crypto market uncertainties. The Binance-owned network saw a 7% increment in market shares, closing at 45% from 38% at the beginning of Q2.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s usability is evident, as it has attracted top guns in the crypto industry. Decentralized exchanges (DEX) Unswap and Pancakeswap launched in BNB Chain earlier in the year, and their launch recorded huge success trading volume-wise. The Binance-owned chain\u2019s drive for improvement and innovation saw it deploy various upgrades, like the BEP-126 feature, which improved the network\u2019s security and reliability.\n\nDespite BNB Chain\u2019s owners, Binance, facing regulatory scrutiny by several regulators globally, the Thursday report has shown how much developers still believe in the chain and its scalability.\n\nBroader Market Smart Contract Adoption\n\nEthereum and the other networks earlier mentioned also saw increased smart contract verification on-chain activities, particularly in May, in a broader market-improved appetite for web3 usage by new dApps and projects.\n\nThe Ethereum network kept its position in the pecking order as Etherscan was the second most-used smart contract validator. Its usage increased by 2% to 33% from 31% at the beginning of the quarter. Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche saw slight improvements in their on-chain verification activities, with 2%, 1.9%, and 0.5% increments, respectively."

However, issues involving Bicasso soon began arising, despite it reaching total capacity within just 2.5 hours of launching and generating 10,000 assets. Critics accused Binance of copying the winners of BNB Chain\u2019s hackathon, \u2018Chatcasso\u2019, due to launching the product with similarities just two weeks after the event.\n\nUndeterred, Binance\u2019s new AI NFT generator claims to be here to stay.

Binance is committed to maintaining a secure and trustworthy environment by adhering to industry best practices and regulatory requirements.\n\nFurther ensuring flawless execution of NFT creation, users wishing to mint NFTs via Bixel must pay a minting fee of just 0.008 BNB ($1.90) through Binance\u2019s blockchain network, BNB Smart Chain. These minting costs will be returned to users creating their artworks before August 10, following early trendsetters being granted 1 BNB as a token of gratitude. More exclusive rewards are also promised to unveil down the pipeline.\n\nRegardless of past controversies, Binance is committed to strengthening the potential of AI-powered NFTs with high regard for legality, empowering artists to create attractive digital art that can easily and securely be shared, sold, and traded for financial gain on a global scale.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether prices were largely mixed but running into the red on Friday morning in Asia, with both looking to end the week in the losers column after a period of directionless trading. The interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday was followed by a bigger than expected GDP number in the U.S. overnight, raising concern about rates staying higher for longer. Japan tweaked its ultra-loose interest rate policy on Friday, adding to the risk-averse mood. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Binance\u2019s BNB led the winners after the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange said it would fully restore operations in Japan in August. The Forkast 500 NFT index dipped and U.S. equity futures moved higher after a down day on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\nLosing steam\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.41% in the last 24 hours to US$29,211 as of 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its loss for the past seven days to 1.97%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency skidded lower on Thursday evening, managing to stay above support at US$29,000, but only just.\n\nConcern about higher interest rates compounded on Friday for risk assets like cryptocurrencies when the Bank of Japan \u2013 one of the last major central banks to maintain a loose monetary policy \u2013 adjusted its yield curve control policy, potentially creaking open the door to higher rates and raising the cost of money.\n\nThe Bank of Japan changing its ultra-loose monetary policies could be an issue to the crypto market, which is running out of price catalysts, Markus Thielen, head of crypto research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed comment.\n\nThe recent Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings in the U.S. could have boosted crypto higher but, \u201cprices have instead been range-bound,\u201d according to a Matrixport report on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) net asset value has lowered its discount from -45% to just -27% this year, but as the discount has started to widen again (from -25%), we see this as a sign that the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF news is losing momentum. The result could be a drop in Bitcoin prices,\u201d said the report.\n\n\u201cPredictably, the crypto market has become very quiet during these summer weeks. This has caused trading volumes and volatility to fall markedly. Investors might be well advised to replace their Bitcoin spot with Bitcoin options, notably upside calls, as lower volatility has made option prices cheaper.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether dipped 0.51% to US$1,860, down 1.68% for the seven-day period.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Polygon\u2019s MATIC leading the losers, and Binance\u2019s BNB the winners.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB gained 0.75% to US$240.46, but was still trading 0.98% lower for the week.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, chief executive officer of Binance, announced at the WebX conference in Tokyo on Wednesday that the crypto exchange will restore full operations in Japan in August.\n\n\u201cJapan is a flagship leader in this (Web3) area and I think is an example for the rest of the world to follow. And to that end, Binance is extremely happy to participate in the Japanese market again,\u201d said Zhao in his address.\n\nOn the regulatory front in the U.S., the U.S. House Financial Services Committee passed a bill Wednesday aimed at defining whether cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities.\n\nThe bill, Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, seeks to increase the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s oversight over the crypto industry and clarify the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe House of Representatives Agricultural Committee also voted on Thursday to approve the bill, which now moves to the House floor.\n\n\u201cThe US regulatory permafrost is thawing. For the first time, Congress took critical steps to establish a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for digital assets in the US,\u201d said Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation \u2013 a global alliance of crypto industry leaders, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cPolicymakers recognize that not only does legal uncertainty stifle responsible innovation, but it threatens to create an environment in which American investors must turn offshore,\u201d Warren added.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.47% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion, while trading volume dropped 16.53% to US$26.07 billion.\n\nForkast 500 dips (again), CyberKongz\u2019s Genkai stumbles\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.65% in the past 24 hours to 2,619.60 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 2.95% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indexes all logged losses, while Cardano\u2019s index edged higher.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 16.28% in the past 24 hours to US$16.84 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, BNB Chain, Bitcoin and Polygon networks fell. The Solana, Mythos Chain, Immutable X and Cardano networks logged increases.\n\nBy NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) saw the largest 24-hour trading volumes, which edged up 2.92% to US$931,750.\n\nBut over a longer time scale the trading picture for BAYC doesn\u2019t look so pretty, with the collection\u2019s 30-day volume slumping 82% and the floor price falling 15% in the same period, according to NFT data tracker WGMI.io.\n\nAn NFT highlight this week is the Genkai collection of 20,000 anime-themed NFTs based on the CyberKongz NFT series. It was launched on Thursday and available on Ethereum and the Ronin blockchain operated by Sky Mavis, the Vietnam-based developer behind breakout play-to-earn title Axie Infinity.\n\nStill, the overall trading slump caused a bit of a stumble for Genkai.\n\n\u201cThe market continued to be very slow and the CyberKongz failed to mint out their full (Genkai) collection. However, they did sell out their full supply of NFTs on Ronin within an hour and so have raised roughly US$2 million,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cBecause of the slow sales in the Genkai collection, the team is giving free extra NFTs to those who mint, continuing a long tradition in NFTs of rewarding holders,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nElsewhere, the U.S.-based online music store Beatport, which is known for selling music resources to DJs for remixes, launched its NFT marketplace Beatport.io on Thursday, where users can buy, sell and trade electronic music recordings as NFTs.\n\nThe Beatport NFT marketplace was developed in partnership with Germany-based Web3 startup Define Creative, and is built on Aventus, a parachain based on the Polkadot network.\n\nU.S. equity futures shrug off rate concerns\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 11:30 a.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. The three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower in regular trading the prior day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leading the losers with a 0.67% slide, ending its longest winning streak since 1987.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were mixed on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei logged losses.\n\nU.S. gross domestic product (GDP) accelerated to 2.4% in the second quarter of the year, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. The number beat analysts\u2019 expectation of 1.8% growth, further easing fears about a recession this year, Reuters reported on Friday.\n\nHowever, the bad news in that good news is faster GDP growth may suggest to the Federal Reserve it needs to do more policy tightening to curb inflation, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday.\n\nHowever, the GDP report did show signs of a slowdown in price gains. The index for gross domestic purchases, an inflation gauge, rose at an annual rate of 1.9% in the second quarter, the slowest in three years.\n\nElsewhere, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced on Friday it will maintain its ultra-low interest rates, keeping its short-term policy interest rate target at -0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield at around 0%.\n\nBut the BOJ also announced an adjustment to its so-called yield curve control policy, saying it will allow \u201cgreater flexibility\u201d in use of the monetary tool, a move seen by some investors as the first baby steps to the BOJ trying to normalize policy after years of an ultra-loose monetary regime to combat deflation.\n\nThe tool, known as YCC, aims to control the shape of the bond yield curve to suppress short- to medium-term rates \u2013 which affect corporate borrowers \u2013 without depressing super-long yields too much and reducing returns for pension funds and life insurers, according to the explainer by Reuters.\n\n(Adds equity section, updates introduction on BOJ, equity futures.)"
