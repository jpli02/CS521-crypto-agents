        "title": "Crypto analysts predict increases for BNB and Dogecoin - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Following bitcoin\u2019s overnight rally to $35,000 on the latest news of the imminent approval of BlackRock\u2019s spot ETF, Dogecoin (DOGE), Binance Coin (BNB) and the rest of the crypto market also showed bullish strength by breaking through key graphical resistance levels.\n\nAnalysts are predicting triple-digit percentage gains for BNB and DOGE in the coming year, in line with the cyclical nature of the altcoin market, which peaks every four years.\n\nThe long-awaited altseason could be coming soon: in the meantime, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance and the overall capitalisation of the crypto sector are giving traders encouraging signals.\n\nIs it time to position yourself for the next bull run?\n\nFind out in this article.\n\nThe performance of Binance Coin (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) after the latest surge in the crypto market\n\nBitcoin surged to $35,000 overnight, shortly after BlackRock\u2019s iShares ETF with the ticker \u2018ibtc\u2019 was added to the DTCC, while also fuelling the rise of other cryptos such as Binance Coin (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nCrypto analysts are predicting that the two coins will make their holders happy in the coming year, when the entire market is likely to explode.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Binance, despite coming under regulatory pressure from various governments around the world, manages to maintain its dominance in the digital currency exchange market by collecting more than 50% of all spot volume on centralised platforms.\n\nFrom mid-April to September, BNB Coin, Binance\u2019s in-house currency, was punished in the market due to regulatory uncertainties, only regaining ground in the last week.\n\nAt this point, however, and in light of the cryptocurrency\u2019s 25th quarterly burn, in which 2.14 million tokens were burned for a total of more than $470 million, BNB is poised to reassert itself as one of the market\u2019s key players.\n\nThe next price targets for the crypto are $250, an area where there is a strong presence of sell orders, and then $300, a psychological threshold that, if broken, could definitely usher in the bull market for the currency.\n\nBeware, however, as the Binance coin is currently overbought on the chart and could give way to a short speculative manoeuvre by the bears.\n\nIn the medium term, however, the recovery of the points lost due to SEC bullying and pressure from other regulators now seems clear.\n\nDaily price chart of Binance Coin (BNB/USDT)\n\nAs for Dogecoin, the market\u2019s main memecoin, analysts are predicting that a rally is just around the corner after DOGE closed yesterday\u2019s daily candle up +10%.\n\nThe best-case scenario for the world\u2019s most famous crypto-dog is the implementation of the currency within Elon Musk\u2018s social platform X, where DOGE could serve as an alternative means of payment for premium services.\n\nThe multi-billionaire Tesla patron has proven time and again that he is a Memecoin supporter, and a few months ago he foreshadowed what could be his next move by inserting the Dogecoin logo in place of the familiar little bird from the old Twitter logo.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, DOGE has been rejected on a number of occasions as traders have tried to push it higher, most recently dropping below $0.06.\n\nHowever, after King Bitcoin\u2019s latest rally, the crypto-meme also flexed its muscles, suggesting that a return to $0.1 is only a matter of time.\n\nAs with BNB, an excessive rise in recent days, with the RSI in the overbought territory, may cause some unhappiness among holders, but prices are expected to stabilise within a few weeks before the rally resumes.\n\nDogecoin daily price chart (DOGE/USDT)\n\nAltseason on the horizon: pumping bitcoin\u2019s dominance and overall market cap\n\nTo fully understand whether the recent performances of Binance Coin (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) herald a return to altseason, it is necessary to broaden the horizons of analysis and observe the trends of two charts in particular.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the dominance of Bitcoin and the total capitalisation of the crypto market, whose upward trends are essential for the future growth of the alt-market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance currently stands at 53.90% and has just broken a resistance that could send the index into the 60% zone.\n\nThis process is crucial for capital to flow into the king of the market and then spill over to the rest of the cryptocurrencies, causing a crash in dominance, as happened in 2021.\n\nAccording to the timeline, it will probably take a few more weeks before altcoins can gain the upper hand.\n\nFor now, only Bitcoin is in charge.\n\nOf course, it is not possible to draw conclusions just by looking at the BTC dom chart, but it is worth supplementing this data with that of the total capitalisation of the crypto sector.\n\nThe latter, much to the delight of shitcoin traders, is also rising strongly, up +8% in the last 24 trading hours.\n\nShould the current weekly candle close above the $1.25 trillion mark, it is possible that the market\u2019s growth could extend further, allowing bitcoin\u2019s dominance to grow in a healthy way.\n\nThis would set the stage for a subsequent pumping of altcoins, which would systematically struggle to emerge in the event of a decline in total market capitalisation.\n\nThe \u201cAltseason Index\u201d, which encapsulates the reasoning just discussed, suggests that it is still early days for a period of alt-dominance and that we are currently in a strong \u201cBitcoin season\u201d.\n\nHowever, the rallies in Biance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and other currencies are encouraging that the trend is about to reverse.\n\nWe should also remember that this chart comes a little later than the market turns, so we may be closer than we think to the return of altseason.\n\nIt is also important to understand that the best time to enter the smaller cryptocurrencies in the sector is not when the index tops, but rather when the uptrend starts from the bottom."

        "content": "The latest boost in Bitcoin (BTC) has reverberated across top altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Meanwhile, investors have eyed VC Spectra (SPCT), a revolutionary decentralized hedge fund, as the best new crypto to invest in for 2023.\n\nLearn in a moment why experts advise you to put your money in VC Spectra. Let's start with the recent progress for the Binance Coin and BNB price prediction estimates.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSummary\n\nBinance initiates the 25th burn procedure for the Binance Coin. Analysts expect BNB to be worth at least $230 by 2024.\n\nVC Spectra provides a decentralized hedge fund for high-return alternative investments. Its native token, SPCT, is set to reach $0.080 in 2023.\n\nBitcoin Cash rises amid growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs. BCH may be worth a minimum of $300 by 2024.\n\nBinance Burns 2.13 Million BNB Tokens - What\u2019s Next?\n\nDespite Binance's ongoing legal problems, BNB (BNB) remains high in the list of top 10 altcoins. One strategy the exchange has used to boost the BNB coin price is 'burning' by periodically removing a portion of tokens from the market. This is crucial for Binance Coin (BNB), given that it's inflationary.\n\nBinance initiated the 25th Binance Coin (BNB) Auto-Burn on October 16, 2023, burning 2.13 million tokens, equaling over $450 million. This event resulted in the intended boost for the BNB coin price. BNB (BNB) is up 8% since October 10, 2023, from $202 to $219.\n\nStill, BNB is barely out of the woods as it remains near its yearly low of $202. Regardless of this short-term dip, BNB coin price forecasts indicate conservative minimum values of $230 and $300 for 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nHigh Returns In Alternative Markets With VC Spectra (SPCT)\n\nVC Spectra appeals to any investor seeking high returns in alternative markets. It's a decentralized asset management and trading platform targeting emerging blockchain and tech companies.\n\nThe platform runs with smart contracts, ensuring key functions like storing funds and allocating profits happen autonomously. This means users have custody over their assets and eliminates the unnecessary costs of intermediaries. It's how no minimum deposits apply on VC Spectra (SPCT), equaling greater flexibility in one's financial involvement.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) comprises a highly skilled team of experts in different fields with the precision to choose high-profile projects. Furthermore, the platform shall apply several advanced trading strategies to handle risks while maximizing gains.\n\nVC Spectra's utility token, SPCT, is the icing on the cake. Like Binance Coin (BNB), it has a burn mechanism. Yet, it differs from the former since SPCT has a fixed supply of 2 billion.\n\nMost importantly, SPCT offers perks like access to exclusive discounted pre-ICOs, voting rights, and quarterly dividends. You can acquire SPCT for $0.055 in Stage 4 of VC Spectra's presale, set to climb by 45% to $0.080 in Stage 6, the final phase.\n\nFinally, let's consider the trending Bitcoin Cash news and forecasts for the BCH token. Can it match BNB and SPCT?\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Excitement Boosts Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nThe week began with a sudden boost to the Bitcoin Cash price on October 16, 2023, due to a false story from Cointelegraph about the approval of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund). Regardless, the Bitcoin Cash price is close to breaking its monthly high of $256, with BCH currently at $246.\n\nWhile the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to greenlight an ETF, excitement persists, coinciding with the rise in Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Companies like Fidelity and ARK Invest have amended their ETF filings. Moreover, even Google Search suggests searches for 'spot Bitcoin ETF' are high, another bullish contributor to the Bitcoin Cash price.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 19% since October 10, 2023, from $206 to $246. Given the buzz around ETFs, further jumps may occur for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) leading into 2024. Based on forecasts, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could reach a minimum of $300 by next year and $450 by 2025.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund"
