        "content": "What Is Arkham Crypto & How to Join ARKM Token Sale on Binance?\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced Arkham as the next project to be featured on Binance Launchpad, a platform allowing users to participate in token sales of up-and-coming crypto projects.\n\nThe preparation period for the Arkham initial exchange offering on Binance Launchpad will start on July 11 and last until July 17, 2023. In total, $2.5 million worth of ARKM tokens (at an exchange rate of 1 ARKM = 0.05 USD) will be distributed among participants.\n\nOpen Binance Account\n\nWhat is Arkham?\n\nArkham Intelligence is a company that provides a blockchain analytics platform where users can track an visualize on-chain activity. The project is now launching the Arkham Intel Exchange, which is an on-chain marketplace for blockchain intelligence. Users who want intel on a cryptocurrency wallet address can make a request on the marketplace, and on-chain researchers can then fulfill the request to earn money.\n\nThe Arkham Intel Exchange implements the ARKM token as a utility token. It provides an incentive for users to submit intelligence or contribute to the ecosystem's growth in other ways. Bounty hunters are required to stake ARKM tokens, which is slashed if they provide low-quality intel submissions. The ARKM token is also used as a governance token, giving its holders the power to decide how the Arkham Intel Exchange will evolve over time.\n\nAnnouncing The World\u2019s First On-Chain Intelligence Exchange\n\n\n\nBuy and sell information on the owner of any blockchain wallet address\u2014anonymously, via smart contract. pic.twitter.com/4xr7dLvOjp \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) July 10, 2023\n\nHow to participate in the Arkham token sale on Binance Launchpad\n\nThe Arkham team will be selling 50 million ARKM tokens through Binance Launchpad, which corresponds to 5% of the token\u2019s total supply (1 billion tokens). Each token will be sold at a price equivalent to $0.05, which means that the team is looking to raise $2.5 million through the sale.\n\nHere are the important dates you should keep in mind when participating in the Arkham token sale:\n\nStart End Preparation Period July 11 (00:00 AM UTC) July 17 (00:00 AM UTC) Subscription period July 17 (06:00 AM UTC) July 18 (06:00 AM UTC) Calculation period July 18 (06:00 AM UTC) July 18 (07:00 AM UTC) Final token distribution July 18 (07:00 AM UTC) n/a\n\nThe maximum investment a single user will be able to make into the Arkham token sale on Binance Launchpad is the equivalent of $15,000. However, not all users will be able to invest this much, as each individual user\u2019s allocation will be determined by their BNB token holdings.\n\nIf you want to participate in the Arkham launchpad, you have to open an account on Binance and verify it. For more information, check our guide on how to invest in an IEO on Binance.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief explanation of how to participate in the Arkham Launchpad:\n\nStep 1 : Create an account on Binance\n\n: Create an account on Binance Step 2 : Verify your account\n\n: Verify your account Step 3 : Select Arkham on the Binance Launchpad homepage\n\n: Select Arkham on the Binance Launchpad homepage Step 4 : Commit your BNB\n\n: Commit your BNB Step 5: Wait for the ARKM token distribution on July 18, at 07:00 UTC\n\nFor additional information, you can check out the performance of some of the previously completed IEOs on Binance Launchpad:\n\n*Data based on a snapshot taken on July 10, 2023, at 13:00 PM (UTC)\n\nWhen will the Arkham token sale on Binance start?\n\nBinance will start recording users\u2019 BNB balances for the purposes of the Arkham token sale on July 11 at 00:00 UTC. This will last until July 17 at 06:00 UTC, when the subscription period will be open and eligible users will be able to commit to buying ARKM tokens.\n\nTokens will be distributed to participants immediately after the token sale concludes, and we can also expect ARKM to be listed for trading on Binance shortly after the token sale.\n\nFollowing this announcement, it will be interesting to monitor the BNB markets, as demand for the cryptocurrency usually spikes whenever Binance announces a token sale on its Launchpad platform."
