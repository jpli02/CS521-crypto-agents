        "title": "Binance Coin Price Analysis & Prediction (Mar 7th) \u2013 BNB Dips Below $300 After Series of Rejection, Which Level is ... - The VR Soldier",
        "content": "Binance Coin continued to lose momentum after witnessing a series of rejections over the past weeks. It cracked down a key pivot level earlier today and slipped near crucial support. More drops lie ahead.\n\nOn February 16, BNB initiated another short after marking a local top at $337. The short led to days of consolidation before activating a swing low.\n\nAlthough there was not much volatility then until yesterday when it attempted to break down the crucial $300 support level. This support level was finally flipped today with an engulfing candle. The price is currently changing hands near a two-month support level.\n\nThe cryptocurrency looks extremely bearish on the 4-hour chart but the daily chart suggests that more bearish actions could be underway. While today appears to be the most volatile moment since mid-February, BNB is likely to paint an uglier scenario by the end of this week.\n\nHowever, following the past days of drops, BNB\u2019s price is stylishly maintaining a lower low and lower high pattern. This bearish pattern is likely to cause serious pain if the price continues to drop in the coming days.\n\nThe interesting thing here is that the price is still respecting the ascending channel. There\u2019s still hope for the bulls.\n\nIf the price manages to collapse this channel due to the ongoing decline, the bulls will continue to suffer until they find a strong support level to fuel positive actions. For now, the bears are fully in control.\n\nBNB Key Level To Watch\n\nAs the bears take charge now, support levels are to be considered more than resistance. The crucial support level of $283 is much more likely to suppress selling pressure for a while before breaking to $270 and potentially $261 in the future.\n\nIf the above crucial support level reacts to price actions just like what we saw in January and February, we may see a quick retest at $300. If the bulls reclaim this important level, the next area of interest would be the $318.4 and $337.7 resistance levels, where it initiated bearish actions last month.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $300, $318.4, $337.5\n\nKey Support Levels: $283, $270, $261\n\nSpot Price: $288\n\nTrend: Bearish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any projects.\n\nImage Source: alexandrasova/123RF // Image Effects by Colorcinch"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe cryptocurrency market kicked off 2023 on a promising foot, as assets like Bitcoin and other leading altcoins in the market recorded significant price gains.\n\nHowever, the bullish momentum built in the past few weeks has yet to reflect a full recovery.\n\nNow, a key player is giving an insight into what players should expect from the market as he puts Ethereum and Bitcoin into perspective.\n\nAccording to Chris Burniske, the former head of crypto analysts at ARK Invest, Ethereum is staging what could be one of the most memorable moves recorded in the market this year. The analyst asserted that Ethereum is ready to break out against the apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin after a consolidation that lasted for almost two years.\n\nHis sentiments come at a time when the market is wary of a possible increase in interest rates from the Feds as inflation rises in the United States. As previously reported, one analyst has recently predicted that assets like Bitcoin could be affected if the Feds take action to raise interest rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remains capped below $24,000, while Ethereum (ETH) manages to clear weekly losses\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum have been trading downwards for the past week. Bitcoin kicked off the new year at $16,547 and surged by nearly 40% in the month of January. The asset went over $23,000. February\u2019s price performance was much lower for Bitcoin and mostly remained below $24,000. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $22,327.\n\nBTCUSD Chart by TradingView\n\nData from cryptocurrency intelligence platform Santiment previews that bottoms are more likely to form as more traders are leaving their positions at a loss.\n\n\u201cBitcoin & Ethereum are both having more traders sell at a loss than at a profit this week, the first such week so far in 2023. Historically, once the crowd is exiting their positions more frequently at a loss, bottoms are more likely to form.\u201d Santiment noted in a tweet.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,560. The altcoin has managed to clear weekly losses by making mild corrections upwards. Santiment also revealed that non-exchange addresses have toppled levels last seen seven years ago.\n\n\u201cEthereum has been fairly under the radar in 2023. However, you probably didn\u2019t know the 10 largest non-exchange addresses just surpassed holding 25M ETH for the first time since 2016.\u201d"

        "title": "Exploring the Benefits of Arbitrum Ecosystem and Trading on Hotbit Crypto Exchange - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) has led to the emergence of various blockchain-based platforms that offer users access to a variety of financial services and products. One of the most innovative and promising platforms in the DeFi space is Arbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network that enables fast and cheap transactions. This article explores the Arbitrum ecosystem and projects listed on Hotbit deserving attention.\n\nIntroduction of the Arbitrum Ecosystem\n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is a layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network designed to address some of the key challenges facing the network, such as high gas fees, slow transaction times, and scalability limitations. Arbitrum uses a unique approach called Optimistic Rollups, which allows transactions to be processed off-chain and then batched and submitted to the Ethereum network as a single transaction, reducing the cost and time required for each transaction.\n\nArbitrum also enables smart contracts and other decentralized applications (dApps) to run on its network, providing users with access to a wide range of DeFi services and products, including liquidity pools, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending and borrowing platforms, and more.\n\nThe recent listing of $GMX on Binance, one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, has led to a surge of interest in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This listing has attracted a large number of investors and traders, who are now pouring funds into the ecosystem. This increased participation in transactions and projects has led to faster adoption of the chain, creating an environment that is ripe for innovation and growth.\n\nAnother project that has benefited from the Arbitrum ecosystem is $PSI, which saw ten times increase in its initial coin offering (ICO) income. This success has fueled further interest in the ecosystem, and more projects like Trove are coming out quickly. These new projects are pushing the boundaries of what is possible on the Arbitrum network, further increasing its potential as a blockchain solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPay Attention to the Arbitrum Ecosystem Projects on Hotbit\n\nHotbit is a leading cryptocurrency exchange allowing users to trade a variety of tokens that run on the Arbitrum network.
