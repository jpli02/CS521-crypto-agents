        "title": "Crypto Whales Acquire 30,000 BTC In Under a Week as Bitcoin Soars - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) bullish momentum has spread to the broader crypto market this week, with all major cryptocurrencies booking impressive gains.\n\nBTC, the leading digital currency, surged by almost 15% in the past 7 days, reaching a high of $35,000 before consolidating at around $34,358 Sunday. This remarkable performance came as Bitcoin continued to break fresh yearly highs, indicating a resurgence in investor confidence.\n\nThe upsurge in Bitcoin\u2019s price coincides with an intriguing development in the crypto world. On Saturday, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez made a significant revelation, highlighting that Bitcoin whales have acquired more than 30,000 BTC in just five days, worth nearly $1 billion. This revelation, supported by data from crypto analytics firm Santiment, highlights the substantial appetite for investment among these major players. To be recognized as a Bitcoin whale, one typically needs a wallet balance of at least 1,000 BTC.\n\nFurthermore, earlier on Friday, Martinez pointed out that when examining the past two market cycles from the market bottom and comparing them with the current Bitcoin trend, it suggests that it is still a favourable time to infuse in BTC, with the next market top for Bitcoin occurring around October 2025.\n\nElsewhere, Veteran trader Peter Brandt agreed with a tweet by Real Vision CEO Raoul Paul, underscoring how when the global money supply is on the rise, Bitcoin typically sees strong performance. Raoul specifically pointed out positive signals for Bitcoin, including an upturn in the Weekly Global Liquidity Index, GMI Total Liquidity, and Fed Net Liquidity, collectively contributing to a favourable outlook for Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, on-chain data reveals a nuanced perspective on the market. Following the recent Bitcoin price rally, two noteworthy developments have emerged in on-chain data analysis.\n\nOn Friday, Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, noted that Short-term holders have been \u201cselling\u201d at the highest profit margin since April, suggesting that some investors are taking advantage of the recent price surge to realize profits. Simultaneously, he noted that whales are \u201cspending\u201d at the highest level since June, signifying significant activity among large investors.\n\n\u201cThis could be consistent with a pause in the rally,\u201d said Moreno.\n\nNonetheless, despite Bitcoin\u2019s price pause, some analysts remain firmly bullish on the top cryptocurrency. Notably, pseudonymous crypto analyst \u201cTitan of Crypto\u201d boldly predicted that Bitcoin could reach a remarkable $69,000 by August 2024.\n\nDrawing parallels to historical market cycles on Sunday, the analyst pointed out that the current cycle closely resembles the second cycle in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cIn the 2nd cycle it took 41 months for Bitcoin to reach its previous ATH and breaks it. If BTC were to replicate what it this cycle, 41 months would lead the price to its previous ATH in August 2024,\u201d tweeted the pundit."

        "content": "Bulgarian banks have been granting increasingly larger mortgage loans this year, a fact linked to the rising housing prices in the country. This is a finding in the regular Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) survey on the credit granting activity of commercial banks, as part of BNB\u2019s economic review.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s report emphasizes that this is also happening against the background of a drop in the number of concluded transactions for the purchase and sale of properties this year. One of the conclusions is that banks are seeing a decline in demand for mortgage loans because of \"the outlook for the housing market and the state of the macroeconomic environment.\"\n\nIn addition to all this, it is notable that the banks are slightly tightening the standards for granting mortgage loans, which are internal guidelines and criteria for approval before negotiating the terms of the loans.\n\nRegarding interest rates, BNB reports that the restrictive interest rate policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) has not yet transferred to Bulgaria, and the increase in mandatory minimum reserves for the country\u2019s banks, which the BNB administratively increased in the summer, has had a \"limited effect\".\n\nThe main reasons for the weak penetration of the new ECB policy in Bulgaria are the high liquidity in the banks and the strong competition for market share, especially in the household sector.\n\nMortgage sizes are growing\n\nThus, interest rates on mortgage loans, which remain at historical lows in Bulgaria, as well as high inflation, are stimulating citizens to buy properties for the purpose of preserving value or as an alternative form of savings and investment.\n\nHowever, BNB\u2019s report also pays attention to the increase in people's incomes, which, in combination with the remaining negative real interest rates on housing loans, has boosted the affordability of housing.\n\nReferring to the statistics, BNB points out that the decisions to acquire a home are increasingly based not on reasons for renting it out, but rather on the possibility of selling it in the future for a profit or as an asset to store value.\n\nWhat about corporate loans?\n\nBanks in Bulgaria have also tightened corporate lending with higher standards and conditions, which usually include both interest rates and various fees and commissions, as well as loan size considerations, terms of utilization, collateral and others.\n\nThe financial institutions have reported a generally lower demand for corporate loans in Bulgaria. This is more pronounced in large enterprises, whereas demand from small and medium-sized enterprises grew in the spring and summer. The main factors for the cooling in corporate lending are the increasing possibilities for alternative sources of financing and the rising interest rates. On the other hand, the driver that influenced the growth in lending to small and medium-sized businesses is the need for resources for investment purposes, refinancing and debt renegotiation.\n\nThe reason for the more significant increase in interest rates on corporate loans, compared to mortgage loans, is the mechanism by which interest rates are calculated - one is based on the international EURIBOR index and the other - on the volume of deposits.\n\nTranslated by Tzvetozar Vincent Iolov"
