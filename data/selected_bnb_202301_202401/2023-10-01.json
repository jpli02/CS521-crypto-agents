        "content": "The owners, former club event organisers and creatives Louise and Liam, moved to Margate from \u00adLondon\u2019s Hackney in the Noughties, with former architecture student Liam taking on all house redesign responsibilities. The Reading Rooms channel the town\u2019s opulent heyday with its dainty chandeliers, floor-to-ceiling sash windows, gently distressed white wooden beams \u2013 and, obviously, reams of books and magazines.\n\nRead our full review here.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3210 (07932 713292)\n\nLymm Water Tower, Cheshire\n\nProbably the country\u2019s most unique B&B, Lymm Water Tower is a 19th-century disused water tower-cum-modern, minimalist family home, which has won a cabinet of design awards since its seven-year-long renovation. Choose between the two-floor master suite with bathroom \u201cfloating over\u201d the bedroom and the penthouse with its own private entrance. Both include access to the unforgettable roof garden \u2013 with time scheduled in clear blocks between guests and the residents, television \u00adpresenter Russell and wife Jannette Harris, their two children and two dogs \u2013 and its teak hot tub, sun loungers and \u00adpanoramic views.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3210 (07850 926326)\n\nDale House Barn, East Lancashire\n\nA pastry chef at the Houses of Parliament for 13 years, B&B owner Dominique knows and loves her food and wants all her guests to do so, too. At her renovated 400-year-old barn on the edge of Gisburn Forest, as well as breakfast, three- or four-course suppers are served, packed lunches prepared and gourmet cookery courses laid on, even including foraging.\n\nThe rooms also come with ready-to-press coffee and homemade biscuits, and produce is sustainable and locally sourced. Plus, Dale House lies within the Dark Skies area of the Forest of Bowland and operates as a \u201cDark Sky Friendly\u201d business, making it a great spot to stargaze \u2013 ideally with 11 mates in the old camping barn.\n\n\n\nDoubles from \u00a3115 (07714 092 089)\n\nLancaster Barn, Lancashire\n\nThe appeal of owners Clare and Paul\u2019s lovingly converted 200-year-old barn lies in its pared-back, soothing inter\u00adiors. Lighting is mellow; wood is oak and blond. Guests take breakfast in the Garden Room or out on the patio, overlooking greenhouses and grounds where much of the food is grown \u2013 afterwards you can wander and pick from the more than 60 varieties of fruits, vegetables, herbs and flowers."
