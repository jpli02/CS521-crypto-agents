        "content": "With the votes of 155 MPs in the 240-seat parliament, Dimitar Radev was elected governor of the Bulgarian National Bank for the next 6 years. He was nominated for a second term by GERB-SDS and supported by PP-DB.\n\n\n\nDuring his nomination, Radev defined the accession of Bulgaria to the Eurozone in January 2025 as an ambitious but achievable goal. After taking the oath, the governor of the BNB said that he would nominate as deputy governors Andrey Gyurov /PP-DB/ and Petar Chobanov /MRF, Minister of Finance in the period 2013-2014/.\n\n\n\n\"One of the most important conditions I set when I accepted to be nominated for governor was that the leadership of the BNB should be elected with broad political support. This is a strong factor for the central bank's independence, including from attempts at unregulated political interference,\" Radev said.\n\nDimitar Radev was elected governor of the BNB on July 15, 2015. An attempt to elect a new governor in 2022 failed.\n\n\n\n"
