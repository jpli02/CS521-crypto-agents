        "title": "Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Whale Moves $1.2 Million Worth Of BTC After 13 Years - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAn ancient Bitcoin investor has made a whopping $1.2 million after moving dormant assets for the first time in 13 years.\n\nExperts share their opinions on IT geeks and a few institutional investors who bought assets in the Satoshi era.\n\nThe falling price of BTC to its three-month low could be seen as a factor that occasioned the sale.\n\nThis year has marked the resurrection of several Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin whales due to gains recorded in the market after the turmoil of 2022, which saw most assets lose nearly 50% of their value.\n\nA Bitcoin whale has sold 50 BTC, acquired in 2010 after 13 years of inactivity, making $1.2 million at present prices. According to blockchain data, the wallet address 13CFnFFn932HdxjP2sJYdijmcDPVvDVT2i received the coins in June 2010, leaving many digital asset enthusiasts wondering why the decision was made to transfer the assets 13 years later in June.\n\nBitcoin whales are large-scale investors who are known for this hoarding behaviour as they mostly sell a significant portion of their stash after many years. As a result of their deep pockets, the activities of bigger whales can swing the direction of the markets, unlike small-scale retail investors.\n\nIt is still unclear if this whale was a corporate investor or an IT geek, as computer geeks dominated the BTC market at that time. A developer Kirill Kretov noted that it is quite possible for \u201cIT Geeks\u201d to hold the stash but added that \u201csome commercial entity acquired those wallets from individuals in some later years, preserving the status of those addresses in blockchain.\u201d\n\nThe price of BTC is at $25,550, recovering from its recent slump below $25,000 for the first time in three months after the Feds hinted that there might be more interest rate hikes in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trend continues amid shaky prices\n\nThis year has seen many old BTC stashes return into circulation after many years of inactivity. In April, two huge transactions were recorded as a 10-year-old stash was moved for about $7.8 million, and just days after, $11 million worth of assets were transferred.\n\nIn Sep 2021, a whopping $30 million in assets was moved after it was acquired for $8,195 nine years ago. Although the resurrection isn\u2019t peculiar to this year, a growing number has come in recent months. The reason cited is the market recovery so far wiping off losses of 2022. Last year, BTC plummeted over 55%, touching new lows not posted in months.\n\nObservers say the surge in the market has led to whales looking to pick up profits after years of hodling while others suggest that recent regulatory crises are another factor."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Friday morning trading in Asia, after falling below US$25,000 overnight and overall posting a losing week, a trend mirrored by Ether. The rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed after finding little impetus from the U.S. Fed decision in the week to leave interest rates unchanged. Polygon\u2019s Matic token had the biggest decline in the top 10 amid sharp falls in altcoins since the U.S. regulator last week labeled many of them illegally issued financial securities.\n\nBumpy week\n\nBitcoin added 2.05% over the last 24 hours to US$25,573.56 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 3.83% in the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about US$497 billion, slipped to US$24,797.17 at around 8:00 p.m. on Thursday, the lowest since March 16.\n\nEther traded little changed at US$1,665.73, up a slight 0.78%, but posting a weekly loss of 10.06%.\n\nSolana led gains among the top 10 tokens by market capitalization, rising 3% to US$14.88, but still down 21.58% for the past seven days. The Solana community on Twitter is throwing around the idea of a hard fork to avoid further scrutiny from U.S. regulators, but such an idea is not being discussed among Solana developers, according to Decrypt.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic was the biggest loser out of the top 10, dropping 4.06% to US$0.5952 to bring the week\u2019s loss to 24.06%.\n\nMost of the top 10 have been on a roller-coaster ride since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) filed lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance.US and Coinbase in the week of June 5. The SEC also named dozens of altcoins as financial securities, including Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB.\n\nThose four tokens combined had a market capitalization of US$57.5 billion as of Friday morning in Asia, which is a sharp 26.5% slump from the US$78.27 billion prior to the SEC\u2019s lawsuits.\n\n\u201cMany notable altcoins, such as Matic, were listed as securities in recent SEC lawsuits, so venture capital firms have been selling their altcoin holdings to capture the little liquidity left and lessen the blow to their portfolios,\u201d said Nick Ruck, the chief operating officer of blockchain venture studio ContentFi Lab, in a Telegram message to Forkast.\n\n\u201cInstitutions are managing portfolio risk and preparing for a continued downtrend amid less market liquidity and tighter regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nIn related moves, U.S.-based trading platform Robinhood delisted Cardano, Polygon and Solana, while the eToro platform halted user purchases of Polygon, Decentraland, Algorand and Dash \u2014 which were all named in the SEC\u2019s legal filings.\n\nThe crypto market seemed to find little relief in the move this week by the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate increases.\n\n\u201cThis pause, or skip seems to be a more tactical move, but the fight against inflation is not over yet,\u201d said Michiel Janssen, trader and analyst at crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, in an email statement shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201cFor crypto this means in the short term that there is less money flowing into the crypto markets. In the longer run, higher inflation and further problems in the banking sector can be a positive for crypto.\u201d\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap increased 1.21% to US$1.04 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 18.55% to US$37.82 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cGrails\u201d sales hit US$17 million\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 1.39% to 2,884.87 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.46% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions fell 25.96% to US$18.58 million. Transaction on Ethereum, the leading NFT blockchain, dropped 10.50% to US$13.2 million.\n\nTransactions on the Bitcoin network, the second largest NFT blockchain, plunged 72.91% to US$1.12 million.\n\nOn Thursday, global auction house Sotheby\u2019s finished its second round of sales of NFTs from the \u201cGrails\u201d collection. \u201cGrails\u201d consists of non-fungible token (NFT) artwork that belongs to the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and its NFT-purchasing fund Starry Night Capital.\n\nSingapore-based Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that once managed as much as US$10 billion, filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in July 2022, which protects assets of insolvent foreign debtors from U.S. creditors.\n\nIn February this year, Three Arrows Capital\u2019s U.S.-based liquidator Teneo said that it plans to sell NFTs owned by the company with an estimated value of US$22 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe second auction brought in nearly US$11 million in sales, including Dmitri Cherniak\u2019s \u201cThe Goose\u201d or Ringers #879, which was sold for US$6.2 million alone. The collection has raised a running total of US$17 million in Sotheby\u2019s sales.\n\n\u201cWhile the NFT community is excited by today\u2019s major art sales from the Sotheby\u2019s auction, that isn\u2019t money that will flow back into NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cThese were seized NFTs from 3AC and that money will go to recouping losses.\u201d\n\nIn other transactions, the NFT staple Bored Ape Yacht Club topped sales by collection, selling US$1.11 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nMythos chain-powered DMarket game NFTs came second with US$899,694 in sales, with over 51,000 transactions in the past day.\n\nU.S. stock futures drop after Thursday rally\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures fell as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after rallying during the regular trading day on Thursday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.15%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.21% lower and Nasdaq Futures lost 0.33%.\n\nThe Dow rose 1.26% on Thursday, S&P gained 1.22% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.15% as optimism grew that the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes are near the peak, according to Trading Economics.\n\nThe U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% after its meeting on Wednesday. The rate is at its highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage last year. The central bank warned of two more rate hikes by the end of 2023.\n\nThe European Central Bank raised its interest rates for the eighth consecutive time on Thursday, adding 25 basis points.\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for July 25 to 26.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at July\u2019s meeting, while 71.9% says the Fed will raise by 25 basis points.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "By Amy Castor and David Gerard\n\n\u201cplease don\u2019t joke about this, a byzantine general stole my life savings\u201d \u2014 owen_needs_tea\n\nIn our last episode, we introduced the SEC complaint against Binance, BAM Trading (Binance.US), and Binance\u2019s founder, Changpeng Zhao (\u201cCZ\u201d); the \u201cTai Chi\u201d plan; the SEC\u2019s proposed asset freeze; and how the Binance money funnel works. But there\u2019s so much more! [case docket]\n\nBinance responds to the SEC\u2019s proposed Temporary Restraining Order\n\nThe current action in the case is the SEC\u2019s proposed TRO to freeze Binance.US assets and keep CZ from moving the customers\u2019 money and cryptos outside the US.\n\nBinance thought it would insulate itself from regulators by launching Binance.US. But it did the opposite \u2014 it opened Binance up to federal regulation. The SEC now wants Binance\u2019s accounting info \u2014 for .com as well as .US.\n\nThe SEC specifically mentions Key Vision Development \u2014 a shell entity that Binance used for years to gain access to the US banking system and only lost in the collapse of Silvergate and Signature. If the SEC gets its way, Binance.com may have no other way to access US banking.\n\nBinance Holdings Limited and BAM Trading (who run Binance.US) responded to the SEC\u2019s proposed TRO and asset freeze. The facts are bad \u2014 so BAM pounds the table, asking why the SEC didn\u2019t bust them before if they were doing something illegal, and that the SEC hasn\u2019t defined which digital assets are securities.\n\nYou may have trouble finding good arguments if one of your subheadings is \u201cThe Allegedly Manipulative Trading Identified by the SEC was Entirely Appropriate.\u201d [Doc 40, PDF]\n\nBAM filed over 100 exhibits, most of which are trash \u2014 press clippings, web page printouts, and documents the SEC had already submitted. There might be interesting stuff in there if you go diving into the docket. BAM also submitted a proposed order of their own. [Doc 41-8, PDF]\n\nBAM\u2019s response does confirm that CZ \u201cresides in the UAE.\u201d\n\nIt looks like BAM proposed a consent order on how it handled US customer assets just before the SEC complaint was filed. The SEC was apparently ready to accept this proposal \u2014 but only if BHL and CZ signed on. They refused to \u2014 so the SEC proposed the apocalyptic version.\n\nBut this left Judge Amy Berman Jackson thinking there was room to negotiate a consent degree so they could all spend time on the actual case \u2014 and so she wouldn\u2019t be dealing with endless appeals just on the order. (She wasn\u2019t so thrilled by 4,000 pages of exhibits either.) Here\u2019s the rough transcript of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, if you\u2019re curious. [Transcript, PDF]\n\nBAM, BHL, CZ and the SEC are now negotiating a consent order \u2014 rather than a restraining order \u2014 to restrict BAM and BHL\u2019s use of Binance US customer funds. [Doc 68, PDF]\n\nUpdate: We have an agreed order, uploaded around 10pm Eastern on Friday night. [Proposed order, PDF] Update 2: Judge Jackson has signed off on it. John Reed Stark explains how this is extremely strong for an SEC consent order. [Doc 71, PDF; Twitter]\n\nCatherine Coley and Brian Brooks: What we did on our holidays\n\nCatherine Coley was the first CEO of Binance.US, hired in 2019. She stepped down abruptly in April 2021 and disappeared from social media \u2014 and kept silence to the point where people wondered what had happened to her. Coley lawyered up and resurfaced only after the CFTC lawsuit against Binance.\n\nQuite a few documents from Coley seem to have found their way to Reuters over the past year \u2014 and the SEC has gotten hold of her internal communications with Binance, in which she questioned large money flows in and out of Binance.US accounts where she had no idea where the money was coming from or going to. [Reuters, 2022]\n\nColey also testified to the SEC, who published portions of her testimony as evidence of the weird things going on inside Binance.US. [Doc 20-6, PDF]\n\nIn March 2021, CZ decided to fire Coley and replace her with Brian Brooks, who started in May.\n\nBrooks previously worked at the Coinbase crypto exchange, then served as acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates federal banks and credit unions.\n\nDuring Brooks\u2019 10 months at the Trump-era OCC, the bureau issued guidance that federally chartered banks could custody crypto, use blockchain-based payment systems and even issue their own stablecoins \u2014 pumping crypto so hard that Congressional Democrats asked Brooks just what he thought he was doing.\n\nFortune wrote up the Brooks OCC\u2019s misadventures in crypto banking and how Brooks\u2019 successor Michael Hsu wound back Brooks\u2019 nonsense. [Fortune; House, PDF, archive]\n\nBrooks\u2019 condition for accepting the Binance.US role was to be able to run BAM himself, independently of CZ and Binance.\n\nThis was not going to happen \u2014 per the complaint, Binance \u201cexerted and would not relinquish substantial control over BAM Trading and the operation of the Binance.US Platform.\u201d\n\nBrooks thought the greatest risk to BAM was that they were \u201chighly dependent on a bunch of technology that sits in Asia.\u201d Brooks tried to bring these technical functions into the US \u2014 but CZ overruled him.\n\nBrooks resigned after 80 days in the job. As he told the SEC, \u201cwhat became clear to me at a certain point was CZ was the CEO of BAM Trading, not me \u2026 as soon as I realized that, I left.\u201d [Doc 20-3, PDF]\n\nBrian Shroder took Brooks\u2019 place as the next sucker in line for the job of CZ\u2019s US puppet on a string.\n\nSecurities offered for trading on Binance.US\n\nThe SEC has stated that SOL (Solana), ADA (Cardano), MATIC (Polygon), FIL (Filecoin), ATOM (Cosmos), SAND (The Sandbox), MANA (Decentraland), ALGO (Algorand), AXS (Axie Infinity), and COTI are securities.\n\nSeveral of these were also claimed to be securities in the Coinbase complaint \u2014 the ones only in this complaint are ATOM, ALGO, MANA, and COTI.\n\nThe SEC only has to show that one of these constitutes a security under the Howey test. But it works through all of them, just to be sure.\n\nThus, Binance.US was offering \u201cexchange, clearing agency and brokerage services to US customers for crypto asset securities, without being licensed to do so and with the securities being unregistered.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a minor matter, any more than it was in the Coinbase or Bittrex complaints. These functions are kept separate because there\u2019s too much potential for conflicts of interest \u2014 where the exchange trades against its own customers.\n\nThe complaint notes that two Binance companies, Merit Peak and Sigma Chain, were frequently the customers\u2019 counterparties \u2014 so Binance literally was trading against its own customers.\n\nSecurities promoted by Binance\n\nBinance offered its own securities, \u201cBNB, BUSD, BNB Vault, and Simple Earn,\u201d per the complaint.\n\nBinance offered BNB in an ICO in 2017. They were explicit that they were raising funds to launch Binance \u2014 this was a straight-up unregistered penny stock. The white paper repeatedly called ICO buyers \u201cinvestors\u201d and talked about CZ\u2019s management expertise.\n\nIn September 2019, CZ directed that Binance.US had to offer trading in BNB \u2014 even though it was blitheringly obviously a security under the Howey test. (David had thought in July 2019 that there was no way Binance would be that foolish.)\n\nColey \u2014 who was partially paid in BNB \u2014 didn\u2019t want to offer BNB on Binance.US, but CZ overruled her. He knew it would likely cause problems, but he figured the profit outweighed the risk:\n\nIn an internal chat in September 2019, the Binance CFO and the Binance CCO agreed that \u201cCZ [wa]s willing to take the legal risk in listing BNB, if [they could] find a way to quantify it.\u201d They further quantified the legal risk of listing BNB on the Binance.US Platform as \u201c$10 mm in legal fees and settlements,\u201d contrasted to the fact that BNB\u2019s price could \u201cgo up 20%.\u201d\n\nBUSD is a dollar stablecoin \u2014 but Binance sells it to investors as the ticket to various investment schemes. Binance would tell buyers that they would make money simply from buying BUSD or from putting it into Binance yield programs:\n\nBinance has, from the outset, marketed BUSD\u2019s profit-earning potential and referred to the various \u201cAPYs\u201d (annual percentage yield) that investors may earn with respect to their BUSD holdings.\n\nThis might seem a stretch \u2014 but when the SEC sued Terraform Labs in February 2023, it made a similar claim that UST was marketed as the required ticket to invest in the Anchor Protocol, and so was part of the investment scheme as it was promoted.\n\nOther schemes were:\n\nSimple Earn, which would \u201cpay interest to investors who lend their crypto assets to Binance for fixed or flexible lengths of time \u2026 15% APR for participants in the BUSD-specific Simple Earn product, and 10% in the Simple Earn product for another crypto asset\u201d;\n\nBNB Vault, a \u201cBNB yield aggregator\u201d in which you could lend your BNB to Binance and get \u201cOne-Click Earning for Your BNB Holdings\u201d;\n\nBinance.US (BAM Trading) offered managed blockchain staking as a service.\n\nAll of these are incredibly obviously securities under the Howey test.\n\nGensler and the alleged conflict of interest\n\nBinance Holdings Limited (Binance.com) wrote to the SEC on June 4, begging the SEC not to freeze Binance.US funds. [Doc 19-14, PDF]\n\nThe fun bit is that BHL claims in this letter that SEC chair Gary Gensler has a conflict of interest in acting against Binance.\n\nBefore Gensler took up the reins at the SEC, he apparently spoke to CZ, including getting CZ to speak to his blockchain course at MIT.\n\nBHL claims that Gensler \u201coffered to serve as an advisor to BHL\u201d \u2014 which we find implausible. Amy has interviewed Gensler in the past and found him to be as careful a speaker as you would imagine. He would have known the SEC job was already in the air.\n\nBHL demands:\n\nMr. Gensler should have been recused from any consideration in this matter based on this history and the prospect that Mr. Gensler may be a material fact witness. To date, the Staff has never confirmed whether Mr. Gensler has recused himself, and if he has not, the Commission\u2019s explanation for why not.\n\nDo they expect this is some sort of get-out-of-SEC-action-free card?\n\nThis is at best a PR move. Its audience is the suckers and any remaining pet politicians. If they bring this claim up in court, we don\u2019t think Judge Jackson will have patience for it.\n\nOther good news for Binance\n\nUS dollar deposits seem to have been stuck on Binance.US since June 9. Binance.US notified customers that it was losing all US banking by June 13 and that their USD deposits might be converted into unspecified stablecoins. It\u2019s not clear this conversion has happened yet \u2014 have any Binance US customers seen this happening yet? [Twitter]\n\nBinance.US\u2019s erstwhile payments processor Wyre has finally shut down for real, owing to \u201cmarket conditions\u201d and \u201cnot due to any regulatory agency direction.\u201d Okay. [Web 3 Is Going Just Great; Twitter]\n\nCustomers of Binance Australia were dumping their BTC at a discount in late May as they rushed to get their funds off the exchange. After June 1, traders were no longer able to withdraw AUD to their bank accounts using Australia\u2019s PayID service. [Bloomberg]\n\nBinance has asked Cyprus to withdraw its Crypto Asset Service Provider license, apparently so it can ready itself for MiCA going into force in the EU. They totally didn\u2019t get kicked out, okay? Binance got its CASP license last October for spot trading, custody, staking, and card services in Cyprus. [CoinDesk]\n\nThere will be no more Binance in the Netherlands as of July 17 as it\u2019s been refused a license after multiple applications. Binance was fined 3,325,000 EUR by De Nederlandsche Bank in July 2022 for operating without a license. [NU, in Dutch]\n\nBinance Nigeria has been ordered to cease operations. \u201cBinance Nigeria Limited is neither registered nor regulated by the Commission and its operations in Nigeria are therefore illegal \u2026 Binance Nigeria Limited is hereby directed to immediately stop soliciting Nigerian investors in any form whatsoever.\u201d [SEC Nigeria]\n\nA fifth of Binance\u2019s 8,000 staff were laid off in late May. Binance responded to news reports of the layoffs by saying it\u2019s just dropping a few employees who \u201cmight not be performing well or who might not be the right cultural fit\u201d as part of a \u201ctalent density audit.\u201d Fifty staff at Binance.US just got laid off a couple of days ago. [Twitter; The Block; Unchained; Reuters]\n\nBinance seems to be positioning Richard Teng to replace CZ as CEO at some point. Teng was recently promoted to regional head of all Binance markets outside the US. He previously worked for the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Singapore stock exchange, and Abu Dhabi Global Market. [Bloomberg]\n\nMolly White writes about the Binance and Coinbase suits for Rolling Stone, with a few quotes from David. [Rolling Stone]\n\nNext episode\n\nIt looks like we\u2019re going to a part 3 just on this one SEC complaint and its many, many exhibits. Here\u2019s part three!"
