        "content": "Advertisement\n\nElon Musk, at least at one point the world\u2019s richest man, has issued a grim warning about the original meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nSpeaking at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s CEO Council Summit in London on May 23, the eccentric billionaire cautioned investors not to allocate all their money to DOGE. \u201cI\u2019m not advising anyone to buy crypto or bet the farm on Dogecoin,\u201d Musk posited.\n\nDespite this warning, the Tesla/SpaceX CEO reaffirmed that Dogecoin remains his favourite crypto in the entire digital currencies market because \u201cit has the best humor and has dogs\u201d. Musk also noted that the most ironic outcome for global currencies would be if a meme coin created merely as a joke emerged as the global currency. As you are well aware, DOGE was invented as a joking tribute to the \u201cdoge\u201d meme of a Shiba Inu dog. The idea was to poke fun at the largest and oldest crypto asset, Bitcoin.\n\nMusk\u2019s History Of Endorsing And Pumping Dogecoin\n\nMusk is known for manipulating the price of dogecoin in the past through his intriguing remarks, actions, and Twitter posts. The self-proclaimed \u201cDogefather\u201d even planned to bring DOGE to space with a SpaceX satellite launch. Dogecoin developers have also revealed in the past that Chief Twit Musk actually sat in on development calls as they discussed how they would revamp the meme coin.\n\nThe entrepreneur still owns dogecoin, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to his tweets from March last year. Musk even bought some DOGE for his youngest son, X \u00c6 A-Xii, in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was speculation that the Tesla boss would soon integrate a permanent Dogecoin payment system on Twitter, the social media giant he overpaid for ($44 billion). However, DOGE\u2019s integration has not yet materialized, leaving fans in a state of great disappointment.\n\nEarly last month, Musk replaced Twitter\u2019s classic blue bird logo with a sprite of DOGE, triggering a 25% spike in the token\u2019s price \u2014 only to remove the Dogecoin logo days later.\n\nDogecoin dropped sharply today after Musk said not to put life savings in DOGE. The OG meme coin was down 2.8% at the time of writing, trading for $0.071, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nDOGE is currently trading 90.25% lower than its May 2021 all-time high of $0.73."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nINTOverse, a Web3 community management solution, has emerged as a trailblazer in the field of social mining, offering users a unique and profitable social experience. With its innovative approach to earning tokens effortlessly, INTOverse has gained significant attention and has become a leading player in the Web3 industry.\n\nAccording to an official press release, INTOverse has continued to pioneer social mining and spearhead the Web3 movement, following plans to usher in a new era of possibilities and opportunities in the Web3 world. Since its closed beta launch on May 9th, INTOverse has experienced remarkable user growth and a surge in social interactions. Within just two weeks, the platform\u2019s daily active users (DAU) surpassed 10,083, with an impressive addition of 5,927 new users per day. The platform has distributed over 100 million messages, highlighting its highly active user base.\n\nThis explains the confidence of enthusiasts on the project with hopes that INTOverse is poised to shape the future of social mining and redefine the way users engage with blockchain technology.\n\nINTOverse And Its Social Mining Model\n\nINTOverse\u2019s social mining model aims to revolutionize traditional mining by allowing users to earn physical rewards while enjoying social interactions. By integrating a Web3 encrypted wallet, digital identity, and AI assistance, INTOverse offers users a seamless and efficient mining experience. The more users interact socially, the higher their social weight and allocation of INTOverse tokens (TOX), providing users with tangible rewards for their engagement.\n\nWith a vision to create a global and inclusive social ecosystem, INTOverse offers exciting features such as group chats, one-on-one chats, and Moments resembling a social feed. These features foster user engagement and encourage the exchange of ideas and experiences within highly inclusive communities. INTOverse also plans to explore and introduce more blockchain application scenarios, providing users with a gateway to experience the potential of blockchain technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the remarkable features of INTOverse is its commitment to user experience and service. The platform offers a one-stop mining service, allowing users to start mining with a single click. Additionally, INTOverse provides round-the-clock technical assistance and customer support, ensuring users have a smooth and hassle-free experience.\n\nFurthermore, INTOverse has eliminated the need for manual transfers of digital assets to wallets, offering users a more convenient and secure solution. Users can now directly manage their digital assets within the platform, enhancing their overall experience.\n\nThe platform has also designed a comprehensive economic model where users receive token rewards during social mining. These tokens can be utilized for platform staking, NFT minting, online marketing, and other functional services. INTOverse\u2019s continuous development and expansion of ecological scenarios, particularly in the area of platform staking, contribute to the deflationary destruction of INTOverse tokens (TOX) and ultimately increase their value.\n\nINTOverse\u2019s impressive achievements in social mining have attracted numerous ecosystem developers, leading to rapid growth in both the ecosystem and user base. The platform\u2019s continuous innovation and trend-setting approach have positioned it as a leader in the Web3 industry. Users can now enjoy a social experience that exceeds their expectations while reaping significant profits."

        "content": "Are you getting a \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d error on PancakeSwap?\n\nHere\u2019s the second part of the error message, \u201cThe transaction cannot succeed due to error: cannot estimate gas\u201d.\n\nFollowed by, \u201ctransaction may fail or may require manual gas limit. This is probably an issue with one of the tokens you are swapping\u201d.\n\nIf so, you won\u2019t be able to buy or sell the token on PancakeSwap.\n\nThe error can occur when you\u2019re swapping a token like Bonfire, Safemoon, or others.\n\nErrors like these are very common on PancakeSwap, so you\u2019re not the only one experiencing them.\n\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll learn what \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d means on PancakeSwap and how to fix it.\n\nWhat does \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d mean on PancakeSwap?\n\nCannot estimate gas on PancakeSwap means that the exchange cannot evaluate the fee of the transaction.\n\nThis typically happens when there are too many decimal places in the number of tokens.\n\nWhen there are too many decimal places in the number of tokens, the \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d error will occur.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re swapping BNB for 155.948235 ANKR, you may get the error message.\n\nThis is because the token has too many decimal places.\n\nAnother reason why you got the \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d error is that the token might be a scam.\n\nTo check whether the token is a scam, you need to view its recent transactions on bscscan.com.\n\nIf the token has a lot of recent transactions (both buys and sells), it\u2019s most likely not a scam.\n\nHowever, if the token has little to no transactions, the token is probably a scam.\n\nHow to fix \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d on PancakeSwap\n\nTo fix \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d on PancakeSwap, you need to increase your slippage tolerance to 12%.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve increased your slippage tolerance, you need to change the number of tokens you\u2019re trying to swap.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re trying to swap BNB for Safemoon, the number of Safemoon may have a lot of decimal places.\n\nOtherwise, the last numbers of Safemoon might be very randomized (e.g. 5207218).\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, PancakeSwap might not be able to estimate the fee of the transaction.\n\nAs a result, the transaction will fail and you\u2019ll get the \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d error.\n\nOn the other hand, a low slippage tolerance can cause your transaction to fail due to the fee of the token.\n\nYou can fix this by increasing your slippage tolerance in increments to find out the lowest slippage tolerance for the transaction to succeed.\n\nStep 1: Select the tokens and open the settings\n\nOpen PancakeSwap and connect your wallet. Select the token that you want to buy in the \u201cTo\u201d field. Select the token that you want to use to swap for it in the \u201cFrom\u201d field. Tap on the Settings icon.\n\nStep 2: Change your slippage tolerance to 12%\n\nInput 12%* into the \u201cSlippage tolerance\u201d field. Tap on the \u201cX\u201d icon to close the Settings.\n\n*Instead of entering \u201c12%\u201d, you can increase your slippage tolerance in increments.\n\nFor example, you can start with a 2% slippage tolerance, then work your way up to 4%, 6%, 8%, and more.\n\nThis will allow you to find the lowest slippage tolerance for the transaction to succeed.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re trying to buy a token like Safemoon, you\u2019ll need to set a slippage tolerance of 12% (this is due to the token\u2019s fees).\n\nStep 3: Enter the amount of BNB/ETH you want to swap\n\nSelect the tokens that you want to swap if you haven\u2019t already (e.g. from BNB to ANKR). Enter the amount of BNB or Ethereum that you want to swap for the token (e.g. if you want to swap 0.04515 BNB, input \u201c0.04515\u201d in the \u201cFrom\u201d field*).\n\n*This will make the \u201cTo\u201d field estimated.\n\nDo note that the \u201cTo\u201d field cannot be estimated if you\u2019re buying a token, it can only work if you\u2019re selling.\n\nIf the \u201cTo\u201d field is estimated, you may receive an error message like the \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d error when you tap on \u201cSwap\u201d.\n\nInstead, you need the \u201cFrom\u201d field to be estimated.\n\nStep 4: Change the last numbers to zero\n\nChange the last numbers of the token that you\u2019re buying to zeroes* (e.g. if you\u2019re trying to buy 155.958 ANKR, change it to 155.000). Swap the tokens!\n\n*When you\u2019re buying a token, you need the \u201cFrom\u201d field to be estimated.\n\nIn most cases, changing the last numbers of the token that you\u2019re buying to zeroes will fix the \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d error.\n\nHowever, if the last numbers of the token that you\u2019re trying to buy are already all zeroes, try changing it to random numbers.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re trying to buy 155.000 ANKR, try changing it to 155.958.\n\nIf you\u2019re still getting the \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d error, try changing the numbers in the \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cFrom\u201d fields to random ones until the transaction succeeds.\n\nThis is because the error message is usually caused by the number of tokens that you\u2019re trying to swap.\n\nConclusion\n\nGenerally, if you\u2019re buying a token, make sure that the \u201cFrom\u201d field is estimated.\n\nTo do so, you need to change the last numbers of the token in the \u201cTo\u201d field.\n\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re selling a token, make sure that the \u201cTo\u201d field is estimated.\n\nTo do so, you need to change the last numbers of the token in the \u201cFrom\u201d field.\n\nThis will mitigate any transaction errors, such as the \u201ccannot estimate gas\u201d error.\n\nFurther reading\n\nBest International Trading Brokers in 2021\n\nHow to Buy Dogelon Mars (ELON)\n\nHow to Buy HODL Coin (HODL)"
