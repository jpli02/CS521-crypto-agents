        "content": "LONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / July 31, 2023 / Helio Protocol, the revolutionary DeStablecoin provider on the BNB Chain, and Synclub, an esteemed staking infrastructure provider, today announced a strategic merger that will bring about transformative changes in the Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) landscape. The merger will birth a novel foundation before year's end, set to oversee both project's revenue and operations. In the event a governance token is launched, it will serve as the governing entity for both projects under the foundation's umbrella. Helio Protocol, known for its USD DeStablecoin backed by BNB, is changing the shape of DeFi and stablecoins in the BNB Chain ecosystem. Boasting a Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $44,603,491 and a total of 661 borrowers, the Protocol provides a platform for users to borrow HAY by providing BNB collateral while farming HAY on trusted partner DEXes for competitive APY. Synclub, on the other hand, is recognized for its autonomous validator nodes on the BNB Chain and is poised to enrich the merger with its expertise in staking infrastructure and design. Presently managing over $240 million worth of staked assets, it ranks as the fourth largest validator on BNB Chain, accounting for 4.12% of total BNB staked. This merger will drive a crucial disruption, positioning Helio Protocol at the forefront of LST and Stablecoin innovation. In response to the popular trend of LSTFi, Helio Protocol aims to turn up the heat in the DeFi summer, powering the trend with a robust roadmap that includes the addition of other asset types as collateral and the launching of a newly established foundation. Upcoming plans include multi-LST collateralization, making $HAY accessible across various blockchains, and introducing innovative use cases for both $HAY and SnBNB. These strategic initiatives will aim to provide users with seamless access, enhancing the overall security of $HAY, while augmenting the protocol's appeal to a broader range of stablecoin users. For more information about Helio Protocol, please visit https://helio.money/ About Helio Protocol Helio Protocol is a trailblazer in the DeFi arena, introducing the world to the concept of DeStablecoins via its pioneering product - $HAY. A DeStablecoin on the BNB Chain, HAY leverages decentralized, liquid-staked crypto assets as collateral, veering away from the fiat-based approach to price stability. The protocol's unique over-collateralized borrowing model ensures that all circulating HAY is backed by excess collateral, delivering unprecedented security to its user base.

        "title": "BNB or BUSD: What Is Better to Invest? - Geeks World Wide",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have taken the world and become a new normal. It made many investors look for the best coins to invest in. The BUSD (Binance USD) and BNB (Binance Coin) are among the popular digital currencies. This article will compare the two and discuss which one may be better to invest in.\n\nSimilarities and Differences of BNB and BUSD\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s check out how similar yet different BNB and BUSD are. BNB (Binance Coin) is the non-Poloniex exchange platform token listed on Poloniex. However, It is the currency that belongs to the Binance Exchange platform. BNB (Binance Coin) can be used to pay transaction fees and access other services. But BUSD is a type of stablecoin that is created on the Ethereum blockchain. It is collateralized by US Dollars and published by Binance. It means that its value will remain stable. Even in five years or so, it will be a store of value.\n\nOne of the critical differences between BNB and BUSD is their underlying purpose. BNB is primarily designed as a native token on the Binance Exchange. It offers various benefits for its user. It includes discounted trading fees and access to certain services on the platform. BUSD, on the other hand, is a stablecoin designed. Its main aim is to provide users with a stable and reliable value repository. Users can use it for different transactions without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. For example, converting BNB to BUSD is a popular stablecoin trade option.\n\nInvestment Potential\n\nRegarding investment potential, BNB has a proven track record of solid performance. This coin had a great price increase over the past few years. It is due to the growth of the Binance Exchange and the popularity of the Binance Smart Chain. Crypto analysts predict that BNB\u2019s price will continue to rise in the coming years. Some forecasting says it could reach a fee of $347.31 in 2023.\n\nBUSD (Binance USD), in contrast, is less likely to see significant price appreciation. All that is due to its value, designed to be stable over time. However, stablecoins like BUSD do offer certain benefits to investors. For one, they provide a hedge against the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, people can use it to quickly and easily move funds between exchanges. They also can make purchases without worrying about fluctuations in value.\n\nRisks of BNB and BUSD\n\nAnother factor to consider is the risk associated with each coin. Binance has faced regulatory scrutiny, and the possibility of further regulation or legal action cannot be ruled out. This could harm the value of BNB and all operations of the Binance Exchange. In contrast, stablecoins like BUSD are less risky. It is because their matter is not subject to the same fluctuations.\n\nWhat to Choose for the Investment?\n\nSo, which coin is better to invest in? The answer fully depends on your investment goals and risk tolerance. If you need a high-growth investment with the potential for significant returns, BNB may be the better choice. If you are looking for a stable store of value, BUSD is what you need.\n\nDiversifying your holdings and staying informed about market trends is the key to successful investing in the crypto market. As a result, you can cut risk and maximize potential returns\u2014all that by staying up-to-date with the latest news and taking strategic approaches.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBoth BNB and BUSD have pros and cons regarding investment potential. BNB offers the potential for significant price appreciation. However, it comes with greater risk due to its connection to the Binance Exchange. BUSD, in contrast, provides a stable store of value. However, it is less likely to see significant price appreciation. If you want to learn more, you can visit https://letsexchange.io/exchange/busd-to-usdt.\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether slipped during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, except the BNB token, with crypto markets poised for an uneventful month ahead, industry experts told Forkast.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below key US$30,000 support level, as market optimism over ETFs ebbs\n\nBitcoin, Ether remain under key levels, top 10 cryptos fall, Tron leads declines\n\nBitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,363 as of 5:15 p.m. in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has been trading below US$30,000 since last Monday.\n\nEther slipped 0.21% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,866.\n\n\u201cThe market is in a consolidation phase at the moment, so I\u2019m not expecting anything massive,\u201d Lachlan Feeney, founder and chief executive officer of blockchain development firm labrys, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting maybe a little bit of a boring market overview. The boring markets price-wise are often the most exciting phase of the market development and technology-wise.\u201d\n\nTron\u2019s TRX token was the day\u2019s biggest loser, falling 4.52% to US$0.07848, followed by Polygon\u2019s Matic token, down 1.41% to US$0.7021.\n\nDespite the price drop, average daily transactions on the Tron network exceeded 9 million in the second quarter of 2023. That daily volume has contributed to an annual rise of 91.24%, according to a report released by Coin98 Analytics on July 19.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.08% to US$1.19 trillion while market volume increased 53.92% to US$27.43 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nForkast 500 NFT index refreshes all-time low, Bitcoin NFT sales start recovery, Ethereum NFT sales extend declines\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.86% to 2,551.57 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and fell 4.46% during the week. The index declined to an all-time low of 2,550.09 points earlier today.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales continued to decline, falling 19.53% to US$537,410 with the network slipping to the seventh largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales also continued last week\u2019s decline, falling 13.03% to US$11 million, despite sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rising 23.63% to over US$1 million. CryptoPunks sales also rose 45.60% to US$139,600.\n\nIn the wider NFT space, Reddit launched its Gen 4 NFT avatar series called Retro Reimagined, with NFTs included from collections like Cool Cats PFP and Micah Johnson\u2019s Aku NFTs.\n\n\u201cReddit Avatars are quietly drawing in millions of NFT holders and will continue to be a pivotal method of onboarding the masses to Web3,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nAll Forkast Labs NFT indexes were in the red for the day.\n\nAsian equities, most U.S. stock futures rise, Europe\u2019s DAX 40 hits all-time high as inflation slows\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities strengthened as of 5:15 p.m. in Hong Kong, boosted by a strong session on Wall Street. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posted gains.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, except the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures and the S&P 500 futures index both increased.\n\nInvestors remained optimistic after Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week hinted at an end to the interest rate hiking cycle after the Fed\u2019s most recent 25-basis-points increase. The Fed\u2019s next meeting on monetary policy is scheduled for September 19-20, where it will decide its next steps on rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level since January 2001. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 80.5% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in September, and a 19.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.\n\nThis week in the U.S. includes second-quarter earnings from tech heavyweights such as Amazon and Apple. The S&P Global\u2019s U.S. manufacturing purchasing manager\u2019s index (PMI) is out Tuesday and the July employment report on Friday, with all offering more peeks into the health of the economy.\n\nIn Europe, Frankfurt\u2019s benchmark DAX 40 hit a new all-time high of 16,540 points, while the pan-European STOXX 600 also remained near its highest since February 2022. Investor morale received a boost as inflationary pressures slowed, with headline Eurozone inflation falling to 5.3%, the lowest since January 2022. But core inflation remained at 5.5%, well above the European Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%.\n\nSee related article: Standard Chartered\u2019s great expectations for Bitcoin in 2024\n\nUpdates with equities section"
