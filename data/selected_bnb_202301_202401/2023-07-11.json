        "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nArkham (ARKM) became the latest project to come from Binance Launchpad.\n\nBinance Launchpad will offer 5% of ARKM\u2019s total supply of 1 billion tokens.\n\nARKM will likely get support from crypto whales.\n\nArkham token (ARKM) becomes the latest project on Binance Launchpad. Pic Created on Canva\n\nYEREVAN (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 Prominent cryptocurrency exchange Binance (BNB) announced its 32nd project on Binance Launchpad called Arkham (ARKM). This highly anticipated project aims to bring innovation to the digital asset space with its unique token sale format and promising features.\n\nThe development already has the whales excited.\n\nBinance Launchpad is a platform for crypto crowdfunding. Cryptocurrency projects conduct an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) to gather support from users at an early stage.\n\nArkham (ARKM) launched on Binance Launchpad.\n\nBinance Launchpad has already hosted successful projects like Polygon (MATIC), Axie Infinity (AXS), and Sandbox (SAND), and now Arkham Intelligence will join their ranks.\n\n5% of the total ARKM supply allocated to Launchpad\n\nAccording to the official announcement from the largest crypto exchange, the Arkham token sale on Binance Launchpad will utilize a popular subscription format. According to the team, this will allow users to acquire ARKM tokens. The sale will have a launchpad hard cap of $2,500,000, with a maximum cap per user set at $15,000.\n\nArkham has a total token supply of 1,000,000,000 ARKM. The developers have allocated only 5% of the total supply, or 50,000,000 ARKM, to Binance Launchpad. One ARKM token will cost $0.05 during the public sale.\n\nThe subscription period will be between 17-18 July 2023. All eligible users will have a 24-hour window to commit their BNB tokens during this period. Users must sign the Token Purchase Agreement before locking their BNB to participate.\n\nHowever, a token sale timeline preparation period will proceed between July 11-17. During this time, Binance will calculate users\u2019 BNB balances by taking hourly snapshots for six days. The average daily BNB balance during this period will determine the maximum amount Binance Tokens users can commit to buying ARKM tokens.\n\nAfter a brief calculation and token allocation process, Binance will initiate the Final Token Distribution on 18 July. After the determined BNB amount has been deducted, Binance will transfer the corresponding ARKM tokens to the user\u2019s spot wallet.\n\nAre crypto whales looking to buy Arkham tokens?\n\nAmid the growing excitement, data indicates that some whales could already be considering the new opportunity. As a recent tweet by Lookonchain suggests, one whale has deposited $35 million to 4 Binance addresses.\n\nSince there is a buying limit set on each wallet, the tweet speculates that the whale intends to buy ARKM tokens through these wallets to maximize their holdings.\n\nA large crypto whale has deposited close to 142,000 BNB tokens worth $35 million amid speculations that he may want to buy ARKM tokens.\n\nIf the Arkham token continues to gain support from crypto whales, its price may rally after the token distribution stage. Nonetheless, amid all the troubles Binance faces, this might come as the next opportunity for investors.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of BNB has rallied over 6% since the news while writing."

        "title": "KTX.Finance Raises $4 Million to Democratize Perpetuals Trading - Business Wire",
        "content": "SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In the midst of the bear market, KTX.Finance, a decentralized perpetuals exchange on BNB Chain, announces a $4 million USD seed round financing led by Hashed. Other participants in the round include: AlphaLab Capital, CRIT Ventures, 100&100 Ventures, Trinito Corporation / Morpheus, GSG Asset, KuCoin Ventures and Sky9 Capital.\n\n\u201cDecentralised trading has grown increasingly popular since the collapse of their centralised counterparts. This was accelerated by the advent of multi-asset shared pool liquidity, which deepens trading liquidity for on-chain leveraged positions and brings capital efficiency for liquidity providers. KTX.Finance demonstrates these concepts as a fresh protocol on BNB Chain, executed by a seasoned team with >40 years of combined developer experience and operationally bootstrapped by ByteTrade Lab.\u201d\n\nEdward Tan, Investments & Research at Hashed\n\nHatched in the aftermath of FTX\u2019s collapse in 2022, KTX.Finance went live in June 2023 on BNB Chain with the aim of bringing perpetuals trading to the masses. While several DEXs have emerged to address CEX risk, KTX.Finance\u2019s competitive edge has been to maintain superior UIUX and speed, as well as lower fees. KTX.Finance is seeing early results, achieving $40 million USD in trading volume from more than 600 traders.\n\nInstead of trading against a market-maker, traders trade against the KLP pool, a multi-asset liquidity pool consisting of 50% stablecoins and 50% blue-chip crypto assets (such as BTC, ETH, BNB). By adopting such a model, traders can trade with full custody of their assets while enjoying the benefits of leverage, good user experience, and low fees.\n\nAdditionally, liquidity providers on KTX.Finance can deposit any blue-chip asset into the KLP pool and receive up to 70% of the trading fees generated by the protocol.\n\nKTX.Finance is operated by Alphamesh and incubated by ByteTrade Lab, a Web 3.0 infrastructure and venture builder based in Singapore.\n\n\"Blockchains, as open and transparent ledgers, excel in decentralizing the asset layer of the Internet. As part of this movement, KTX.Finance is leading the way in democratizing the perpetuals market. ByteTrade Lab has a shared vision with KTX.Finance of more accessibility and user empowerment, and we have high confidence in the project's ability to bring DeFi to more users globally.\u201d\n\n- Dr. Lucas Lu, CEO of ByteTrade Lab\n\nByteTrade Lab, headquartered in Singapore, raised 50 million USD Series A financing in June 2022 from investors such as Susquehanna International Group (SIG) Asia Venture Capital Fund, INCE Capital, BAI Capital, Sky9 Capital, BlueRun, and PCG. They are committed to creating a decentralized Internet that gives individuals ownership and control over their financial and daily Internet data.\n\nByteTrade Lab is actively incubating Terminus OS and a network of decentralized Edge Nodes, also known as privately-owned personal servers. Through these Edge Nodes, users can self-host and run open protocols and software, enabling them to leverage extensive computational and storage capabilities. This empowers users with increased access and control over their Internet data, ultimately establishing a user-centric decentralized Internet network that aligns with the full value proposition of Web 3.0.\n\nAbout KTX.Finance\n\nKTX.Finance is an on-chain decentralized derivatives trading protocol that utilizes a unique multi-asset liquidity pool. Traders are able to take on 50x leverage on their trades while LPs enjoy high capital efficiency. Please visit ktx.finance and follow us on Twitter at @KTX_finance.\n\nAbout ByteTrade Labs\n\nByteTrade Lab is giving data ownership back to users and democratizing the marketplace of online information. We are helping to build a new internet that is self-hosted, user-controlled, and truly private. Our novel peer-to-peer operating system, Terminus OS, is built to run on top of a network of decentralized personal servers protected by personal private keys. The result is a decentralized cloud owned by users, where anyone can access the information they choose. ByteTrade is backed by Susquehanna International Group (SIG)\u2019s Asia VC Fund, and leading institutional investors including INCE Capital, BAI Capital, Sky9 Capital, BlueRun and PCG.
