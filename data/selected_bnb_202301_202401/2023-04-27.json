        "content": "April 27 (SeeNews) - Bulgaria's central bank said that it decided to increase the mandatory reserve requirements for local banks, aiming to reduce the credit risk in the country's banking system.\n\nStarting June 1, the minimum reserves on funds attracted by banks from non-residents will go up to 10% from 5%, whereas starting July 1 the minimum reserves on funds raised from both residents and non-residents will increase to 12% from 10%, the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe decision to tighten lending conditions is dictated by the slow trickle effect into the Bulgarian banking system of the tightened monetary policy of the European Central Bank as well as the limited consequence of the increased countercyclical buffer rate on the lending activity in the country, the BNB said.\n\n\"The measure will withdraw some of the current excess liquidity in the banking system and contribute to reducing the free resources with which banks can lend, creating incentives for a faster and more significant transfer of the increased interest rates in the euro area to the cost of loans,\" the central bank noted. A decreased lending activity will also help gradually slow down inflation.\n\nThe spike in consumer prices, high salary increases in the private sector, strong consumer demand and the continued high growth of lending to households were some of the factors creating risks for the stability of the banking system in Bulgaria, the BNB said.\n\nIn the three months to end-December, the loans and advances in Bulgaria's banking system increased by 3.6% on the quarter to 92.7 billion levs ($52.4 billion/47.4 billion euro), taking up a share of 59.6% as of end-2022, BNB said in a quarterly overview of the banking system published earlier this week.\n\n(1 euro = 1.95583 levs)"

You can hear a dozen shots in the video before the shooting briefly stops, then resumes.\n\nPolice say when they arrived at the home where the shooting happened, no one was there.\n\nA man showed up to Holy Cross Hospital, within walking distance of the scene, shortly after the shooting with a gunshot wound.\n\nHe was transferred to Broward Health Medical Center where he died.\n\n\"It was frightening, you know, because this isn't a neighborhood where you hear that kind of thing,\" said a woman who lives in the area.\n\nNeighbors tell us the home where the shooting happened was an Air BnB, and that the home is a revolving door.\n\n\"I had called this morning to see what we can do about that maybe being \u2014 the Air BnB \u2014taken away from this house. And they said well, the only thing we can do is come out if they have the lawn not taken care of or the pool is not taken care of. I said, well what about people being murdered? And they said, well, that's for the cops,\" said a neighbor.\n\nResidents also tell us they saw two people run from the house and take off in a blue pickup truck.\n\nSo far, no arrests have been made in the case and the victim's identity is unknown.\n\nWe also reached out to Air BnB about the incident, and have not heard back."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher on Thursday but other crypto assets failed to replicate the similar move. Bitcoin recovered after the muted performance of banking stocks in the US. Crypto regulations remained the buzzing topic across developed economies.\n\n\n\nBitcoin extended its gains as the largest crypto asset was trading with decent gains rising more than 2 per cent to hover around the $29,000 mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, rose in tandem by 2 per cent and regained the $1,900 level. The performance of the altcoin was mixed in the early trade.\n\n\n\nFollowing concerns over First Republic Bank on Wednesday, Bitcoin has returned to $29,000 as markets react. In yesterday's session, Bitcoin surged to $29,121, rebounding from its low of $27,217 the previous day, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"This increase has erased Bitcoin's losses from the past week and brought it to its highest point in seven days. Currently, Bitcoin has support at the $28,000 level and resistance at $29,400. Meanwhile, Ethereum has climbed above the $1,900 level and achieved a five-day high,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the top names, only Cardano and Polygon were trading in the green as both rose up to 2 per cent during the early trade. On the contrary, the cuts were capped. Among the losers, Litecoin dropped about 3 per cent, whereas BNB was down 2 per cent. XRP and Polkadot shed over a per cent, each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, hovering around the $1.20 trillion mark as it jumped more than one per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes soared about 73 per cent to $70.12 billion.\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s largest crypto asset, Bitcoin, touched the $30,000 mark on Wednesday. The crypto market is showing strong signs of ending the crypto winter which dominated the crypto market in 2022. The regulatory support shown by major economies like the UK and Europe will pave the way for a more mature crypto ecosystem across the globe, said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin.\n\n\n\n\"Ex-CFTC boss, Chris Giancarlo, made an important statement yesterday in support of the crypto industry in the US. Giancarlo reiterated the fact that regulators can engage with crypto entities if they have the will to do so. Standard Chartered, made a prediction that crypto winter is over and Bitcoin has the potential to touch the $100,000 mark by the end of 2024,\" he said.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nSolar blockchain, previously known as Swipe, has its own utility token called SXP, which can be staked to ensure the network's security and earn incentives, as well as used it to pay transaction fees on the Solar blockchain. Users can also participate in governing the Solar blockchain by submitting proposals and voting on protocol updates while earning rewards for offering liquidity. Moreover, SXP is the primary currency utilized by Solar DApps.\n\n\n\nOn the weekly time frame, SXP is trading extremely close to the breakout levels, with the chart on the verge of a breakout from the descending trendline. SXP surged by nearly 10% in the last week, edging close to the $0.7 level. We could expect a strong upsurge if the trend breaks above the current trading levels. The next resistance is expected at $0.84 and immediate support is expected at $0.53 levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Summary: As of now, users cannot buy BNB (Binance Coin) with PayPal directly since it isn\u2019t included in PayPal\u2019s offering. To buy BNB with PayPal, you have to use third-party intermediary services such as cryptocurrency exchanges and brokerages such as eToro.\n\nBest Crypto Exchange for Intermediate Traders and Investors Invest in 70+ cryptocurrencies and 3,000+ other assets including stocks and precious metals.\n\n0% commission on stocks - buy in bulk or just a fraction from as little as $10.

Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nCan you buy BNB with PayPal?\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market and one of the largest by market capitalization and volume of trade. Despite this, it still isn\u2019t among the cryptocurrencies offered by PayPal via its platform, which is reserved for Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and PayPal USD (PYUSD) only.\n\nIn short, you can\u2019t buy Binance Coin (BNB) directly through PayPal. That said, you can still use PayPal together with a third-party investment platform to buy BNB. The only step you need to take is to connect your PayPal deposit with an intermediary brokerage of your choice, which you can then use to execute the purchase.\n\nEven if you could buy BNB with the PayPal app directly, you probably wouldn\u2019t want to. PayPal\u2019s cryptocurrency transfer fees are notoriously higher than those of most cryptocurrency exchanges online. By using a middle-man service, you can easily bypass the fees that go up to 1.8% without spread expenses. In comparison, that\u2019s almost double that of eToro\u2019s, which is constant at 1% in all cases.\n\nHow to buy BNB with PayPal?\n\nThe most cost-effective way to buy BNB with PayPal is to use the intermediary services of a trusted and well-renowned investing platform like eToro. Being one of the top-rated brokerages of its type around, this platform is home to almost 30 million crypto traders.\n\nWith 60+ tokens available for trade, eToro\u2019s selection dwarfs that of PayPal. What\u2019s more, eToro gives access to features such as copy trading and hodling, along with multiple analytical tools and charts that make crypto trading easier.\n\neToro investing platform. Source: eToro.com\n\nSo, how about you start buying? Simply connect your PayPal account and give eToro access to its deposit. PayPal can provide you with cash from a bank account, a credit/debit card, or a prepaid card. Once you have ensured that there are enough funds in your account, you can proceed to buy BNB.

You know what we\u2019re talking about: millions from around the globe use it daily to commit transactions at any time\u2013you and me included. PayPal is known for the versatility of its service, high standards of safety, and practical flexibility can be relied upon. With only access to a bank account or a credit/debit card, you can send and receive money in short amounts of time or even instantly.\n\nPayPal homepage screenshot. Source: PayPal.com\n\nIt is important to add that PayPal quickly embraces financial innovations, such as cryptocurrency. This helps them stay on top of current trends and ensures quality service to its users.\n\nPayPal crypto policy\n\nIn one of his speeches Dan Schulman, the CEO of PayPal, \u201cpraised the utility that digital currencies can provide for payments.\u201d This corresponds with PayPal\u2019s crypto policy: the platform wholeheartedly supports cryptocurrency and has no official stance that inhibits trading in digital assets in any way. It has even embraced several tokens and allowed their purchase directly through its app.\n\nNote While you have the option to buy crypto directly from PayPal, you might want to think twice before opting for that. Why? The associated fees are significantly higher than those of e.g. eToro. Consider using an exchange service with better rates.\n\nHow to buy BNB with PayPal safely\n\nAfter all those years of debate, it\u2019s become evident that crypto is here to stay. Perhaps it\u2019s not yet at the same level as fiat, but cryptocurrency is already legal tender for two countries and accepted by many reputable businesses all over the world.\n\nNew developments have made blockchain technologies safer and less impactful on the environment. People are more informed about the advantages of crypto. Everything indicates that cryptocurrencies are heading toward their rightful place in our society.\n\nStill, the crypto market is neither a peaceful nor stable place. Volatile value drops and changes in trends shake the industry, making beggars and millionaires on a whim. To make matters worse, there are people lying in ambush for those less experienced to scam or rob them of their funds.\n\nThere are, however, ways to keep safe in this new and changing environment. Make sure to follow these steps to minimize the chances of anything unwanted happening to you.\n\nTips on how to buy BNB with PayPal safely\n\nLearn your crypto craft before you start trading: Always perform the necessary research on crypto and how it works before trading. No use crying over spilled milk.\n\nAlways perform the necessary research on crypto and how it works before trading. No use crying over spilled milk.
