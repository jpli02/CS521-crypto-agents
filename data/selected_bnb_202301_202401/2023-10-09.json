        "title": "BNB Crashes 5% Weekly but How Low Can it Go? Three Things to Watch this Week (Binance Coin Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "With buyers absent, BNB is struggling to hold above $200.\n\nKey Support levels: $206, $180\n\nKey Resistance levels: $220, $230\n\n1. Indecision Continues\n\nBinance Coin has not managed to move away from its key support just above $200. This is not ideal, as any new sell pressure could quickly test or even break this level. The price action also shows that sellers are having the upper hand right now.\n\n2. Indicators Lean Bearish\n\nThe volume and momentum indicators show weakness and are bearish on the daily timeframe. Generally speaking, volume was always higher on the sell side and this is reflected both on the RSI and OBV which remain low.\n\n3. MACD Bearish Cross\n\nThe daily MACD just did a bearish cross, further confirming that sellers appear to dominate at this time. If buyers don\u2019t return, then the key support at $206 is in danger.\n\nBias\n\nThe bias for BNB is bearish.\n\nShort-Term Prediction for BNB Price\n\nPrepare for another test of the key support at $206. If that breaks, then BNB\u2019s price will likely move towards $180 next."

        "title": "A Stay at Lin Wood's MAGA-Friendly Bed-and-Breakfast - The New Yorker",
        "content": "\u201cNo. I have not \u2018flipped\u2019 on President Trump,\u201d Lin Wood recently assured his nearly three hundred and fifty thousand followers on Telegram. Fani Willis, the D.A. in Fulton County, Georgia, had just named Wood, a former lawyer allied with Trump, as a witness for the prosecution in a court filing. \u201cI have no idea why,\u201d Wood wrote. He also posted, not for the first time, a Photoshopped image of his dog, Allie, in a prison guard\u2019s uniform. Caption: \u201cWarden Allie guarding LINMATE #777 at Tomotley Prison.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2020 election, Wood moved from Atlanta to Tomotley, a thousand-acre plantation in Yemassee, South Carolina, which he\u2019d bought for about eight million dollars. A broker called it \u201cthe most significant property that has sold in years in South Carolina\u201d and mentioned its excellent duck and quail hunting. Tomotley seemed an odd choice for Wood. \u201cI don\u2019t hunt,\u201d he said recently, by phone. \u201cI don\u2019t fish. I don\u2019t farm.\u201d He went on, \u201cBut I obeyed what I felt like God wanted me to do.\u201d The Lord wanted him to open a bed-and-breakfast, where rooms cost up to six hundred and fifty dollars a night. Wood set up the B. and B. on an adjacent plantation, which he\u2019d also bought, and called it the Inn at Cotton Hall.\n\n\u201cA lot of them follow me on Telegram,\u201d Wood said, of his paying guests. \u201cI\u2019ll spend three, or four, or five hours with them. We talk about the state of the nation and the world. We talk about President Trump. And we talk primarily about Jesus Christ.\u201d Wood doesn\u2019t prepare breakfast, but that hasn\u2019t hurt reviews. \u201cWhen it was time to check out, I got teary-eyed,\u201d one Yelper wrote. \u201cSpecial thanks to Mr. Wood for spending so much time talking with us,\u201d wrote another.\n\nBefore formally getting into the B.-and-B. business, Wood hosted the indicted former Trump attorney Sidney Powell; the former national-security adviser and unindicted co-conspirator Mike Flynn; and Doug Logan, of Cyber Ninjas, the now defunct firm hired by Arizona Republicans to look for voter fraud. Wood insists that the MAGA contingent crashed his place, uninvited, in November of 2020, soon after the election. Powell arrived and told him that Mike Flynn was coming, too. \u201cSo Flynn showed up, and four or five other people were with him,\u201d Wood said. They commandeered a living room and a sunroom, and set up a whiteboard and computers. \u201cI knew Sidney was working on filing election lawsuits,\u201d Wood continued. \u201cI told her I wasn\u2019t interested in being involved in any fraud cases, because fraud cases take a long time.\u201d The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has since described Wood\u2019s plantation as \u201cthe central hub for the voter fraud information processing.\u201d\n\nWood said that Flynn, who stayed through Thanksgiving (he carved the turkey), is no longer welcome. Flynn has a \u201clove for lucifer,\u201d Wood wrote on Telegram. He added, by phone, \u201cWhen somebody invites themselves to your property, don\u2019t let them come.\u201d\n\nA curious local recently decided to check in at Cotton Hall, to see Wood\u2019s hospitality business in action. He drove down an oak-lined driveway and arrived at a white-columned house built a century ago. A white Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow II was parked out front. The visitor was shown to his room, named Huspa Isle, where he found a four-poster bed with a too-soft mattress, a gas fireplace, and plantation-core antiques. Television, no. Bibles, yes (two). There was also a 1941 book titled \u201cWhite Pillars,\u201d which, according to its foreword, is \u201ca survey of the habitations of man of the Caucasian race\u2014genus, North American; species, Deep Southern; variety, planter.\u201d\n\nOutside, the visitor met two middle-aged guests, a couple from North Carolina. \u201cWe follow Lin on Telegram,\u201d the man said. They disappeared down a path, in search of alligators. Squirrels collected acorns under the moss-draped oaks. But Wood was nowhere to be found.\n\nEventually, the guest retired. Sinking into bed, he checked Wood\u2019s Telegram, using the spotty Internet. Wherever Wood was, he was reposting Trump items and musing about Freemasonry. (\u201cFreemasons can kiss my Southern grits.\u201d)\n\nAt breakfast the next morning\u2014Rice Krispies, muffins, fruit\u2014guests griped about liberal cities and wondered whether Wood might make an appearance that day. The man from North Carolina, struggling with a Keurig coffee maker, wore a \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me, I Voted For Trump,\u201d shirt. His partner said, \u201cWhen I was making reservations, I asked, \u2018Is Lin gonna be there?\u2019 \u201d She was told that Cotton Hall couldn\u2019t say, for security reasons. The local visitor checked Telegram. Wood had posted a video of a cow: \u201cMorgan\u2019s Morning Motley Moo Report.\u201d The visitor checked the pasture\u2014no Wood. That night, back at home, he opened Telegram again: there was a photograph of Wood, thumbs up, posing with the North Carolinians. \u2666"

This would be the view from the side of the building closest to Mineral Trace. Prev Next\n\nThe Hoover Planning and Zoning Commission on Monday night recommended the Hoover City Council approve plans for a 23-room \u201cboutique bed and breakfast\u201d facility in the Trace Crossings community despite opposition from some nearby residents.\n\nJordan Hosey of HBH Holdings wants to build the five-story bed and breakfast, now called Brock\u2019s Gap Boutique BnB, on 2.4 acres at the corner of Stadium Trace Parkway and Mineral Trace, across the street from Brock\u2019s Gap Brewery and the Abingdon 55+ residential community.\n\nHer plan is to put a restaurant with an outdoor patio area and salon on the first floor, 22 short-term rental units with one to three bedrooms on floors two to four, and an enclosed event area and cigar bar, outdoor bar and pool, and one additional rental unit on the top floor.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a hotel,\u201d Hosey said. She\u2019s trying to bring something new and modern to the city and breathe life into Hoover, she said.\n\nIt\u2019s ideal for families and groups coming to sporting events at the Hoover Metropolitan Complex and for Hoover residents who want a cool and convenient place for loved ones to stay when they come in town to visit, Hosey said.\n\nDavid Bannister, a resident of the nearby Abingdon by the River community, said this is the kind of entrepreneurial venture the city\u2019s economic development team has been seeking.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have this type of amenity in our area,\u201d Bannister said. \u201cThe need for this is paramount. I think this is a complete home-run project.\u201d\n\nBut many residents of the nearby Chestnut Ridge community spoke against it.\n\nNancy Carr said the boutique hotel sounds lovely and is a well-thought-out idea, but the height of the building is a problem.\n\nHosey and her development team plan to screen the facility from the Abingdon community just across Stadium Trace Parkway by leaving a 100-foot tree buffer in place along the parkway and maintaining an elevation that should not be visible from Abingdon. The building itself would be at least 300 feet away from the median of Stadium Trace Parkway and at least 533 feet away from the homes in Abingdon, said Andrew Cummings of the Gonzalex Strength & Associates engineering and design firm.\n\nHowever, people who live in Chestnut Ridge on the mountain ridge next to Abingdon will be at the same level of the hotel and be exposed to the lights and noise, several residents said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be right at us,\u201d Bill Grubbs said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a bunch of mad older people.\u201d\n\nResidents said they were particularly concerned about noise from the rooftop outdoor bar and pool, fearing loud music and other party noise will disturb them. Noise from the Hoover Metropolitan Complex and Brock\u2019s Gap Brewery and other sounds from the valley already climb up the ridge to Chestnut Ridge, they said.\n\n\u00d7 Expand Image from Black Design Architecture A sketch of the rooftop bar and pool proposed as part of the Brock's Gap Boutique BnB in the Trace Crossings community in Hoover, Alabama.\n\nResident Bill McCanna said the whole top floor should be enclosed.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a bar that doesn\u2019t have loud music,\u201d McCanna told the zoning board. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a party animal place for big events in people\u2019s lives, and they\u2019re there to party. This is going to be a problem for people who live on that ridge, and you people are the only people who can stop it.\u201d\n\nHosey said she doesn\u2019t plan to have bands and amplified music outside, other than typical wired-in speakers. She plans to keep the atmosphere low-key, maybe with some acoustic music, she said.\n\n\u201cI am not trying to be Club La Vela at 2 o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d she said.\n\nPaul DiGiorgio, an architect with Black Design Architecture, noted that Hosey doesn\u2019t want to do anything that is going to hurt the marketability of the facility and that people will be trying to sleep 8 feet below the rooftop bar.\n\nThe conditions recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission are to keep the amplified music inside and have all amplified music shut off at 10 p.m. The rooftop bar and pool also would have to close at 11 p.m.\n\nDiGiorgio also noted that the building is designed in such a way that the rooftop bar and pool are on the side of the building away from the nearest residents, with the building itself serving as a sound screen of sorts.\n\nPlanning Commissioner Jennifer Peace noted that this land already is zoned for \u201cplanned industrial\u201d use and that someone could put a gasoline station or some type of industrial use on the property without having to get a zoning change.\n\nAbingdon resident Molly McGregor asked if a traffic study had been conducted. Darrell Skipper, a traffic engineer hired by Hosey, said the facility should generate about 49 trips in the mornings and 70 trips in the afternoons. A bed and breakfast facility is on the low side of traffic generation compared to what some other type of commercial or industrial facility might bring, he said.\n\nThe zoning board put restrictions so that operations on the ground floor could operate only between 5 a.m. and 5 p.m., and the rooftop bar and pool could only be open from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., except for people staying in a room there.\n\nAnother condition is that no one would be allowed to stay for more than 180 days at a time, which makes all guests subject to a lodging tax.\n\nThe zoning board\u2019s recommendation now goes to the Hoover City Council for a public hearing and a vote on Nov. 20.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated at 9:42 a.m. on Oct. 10 to correct the name of the company for which Andrew Cummings works. It is Gonzalez Strength & Associates."
