        "title": "Airbnb guest 'from hell' squatting at home for 500 days \u2014 wants owner to pay $100K - New York Post",
        "content": "An Airbnb guest dubbed \u201cthe tenant from hell\u201d has been squatting at a luxurious guest house overlooking the hills of Los Angeles for more than a year and a half \u2014 and is refusing to leave unless the homeowner pays her a $100,000 relocation fee.\n\nElizabeth Hirschhorn rented a long-term stay at Sascha Jovanovic\u2019s Brentwood guest home in September 2021 for six months at a rate of $105 a night, with fees bringing the total to $20,793, according to court documents.\n\nBut her Airbnb stay ended in April 2022, and Hirschhorn has been living there rent-free ever since.\n\nA judge ruled that under the city\u2019s rent stabilization ordinance, Jovanovic has no legal reason to evict her under Los Angeles\u2019 recently adopted Just Cause Ordinance \u2014 and would be required to pay her a relocation fee to evict her.\n\nIn an email to Jovanovic\u2019s lawyer obtained by the Los Angeles Times, Hirschhorn\u2019s attorney, Amanda Seward, argued \u201c$100,000 is [Jovanovic\u2019s] cheapest way of getting of the whole ordeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the home of the tenant until the landlord gets a judgment, however distasteful that is to your client.\u201d\n\nHirschhorn\u2019s attorneys also argue she should not pay rent \u2014 and should instead be paid back the $20,793 \u2014because the city never approved the guest house for occupancy, and its shower was constructed without a permit.\n\n\u201cThe landlord broke the law and tried to make money by renting out an illegal bootleg unit,\u201d her attorney, Colin Walshok told the LA Times.\n\n4 A judge ruled that Jovanovic would have to pay Hirschhorn a relocation fee to get her evicted. Instagram/@drsaschajovanovic\n\n\u201cAfter he was caught, instead of doing the right thing, he has resorted to bullying, harassment, and the filing of frivolous lawsuits containing elaborate false stories, all in an attempt to cover his tracks.\u201d\n\nBut Jovanovic\u2019s attorney, Sebastian Rucci, disagrees.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the tenant from hell,\u201d he said of Hirschhorn. \u201cIf she\u2019s right, the theory is that if a landlord has something that isn\u2019t permitted, then you can stay in it rent-free forever.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by the Times, Jovanovic and Hirschhorn were cordial for the first few months she was staying at his guest house \u2014 exchanging niceties when their paths crossed and sharing tea and small talk on a deck that separates the main house from the Accessory Dwelling Unit.\n\nThe trouble apparently began about five months into Hirschhorn\u2019s stay, when she complained her electronic blinds stopped working.\n\nWhen Jovanovic went into the unit to repair them, he noticed water damage and signs of mold around her sink, which he claims were not there before Hirschhorn moved in.\n\n4 Elizabeth Hirschhorn rented a long-term stay at Sascha Jovanovic\u2019s Brentwood guest home in September 2021 \u2014 renting it for six months at a rate of $105 a night, with fees bringing the total to $20,793. Google Maps\n\nHe offered to pay her to stay at a hotel for five days while his contractor handled the repairs \u2014 either the Santa Monica Hilton or the Sure Stay Best Western in Santa Monica, noting that many of his visiting doctors stay there, according to messages reviewed by the Times.\n\nJovanovic even offered Hirschhorn $1,500 toward any other hotel, the messages and emails show, according to the Times.\n\nBut Hirschhorn declined, writing back: \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe being forced to vacate with a housing disability and the high risks of COVID-19 complications.\u201d\n\nShe cited LA County\u2019s COVID-19 Tenant Protections Resolution and a 2011 doctor\u2019s note about extreme chemical sensitivities.\n\n4 Jovanovic claims Hirschhorn left water damage and signs of mold around her sink. Instagram/@drsaschajovanovic\n\nApparently still trying to assuage Hirschhorn, Jovanovic then offered for her to stay in his home, but she declined that as well, citing an extreme disability due to cat dander.\n\nShe now claims in a countersuit that Jovanovic \u201cinappropriately invited\u201d her to move in with him.\n\nTensions continued through the rest of her stay, and when it became clear Hirschhorn was not leaving or allowing any access inside the unit, Jovanovic reluctantly agreed she could stay through April 12 to give her time to find another place, according to an email in his complaint.\n\n\u201cShe asked for more time, but I told her it wasn\u2019t possible since I had other Airbnb reservations coming up,\u201d Jovanovic told the Times. \u201cBut then I tried to be nice and give her an extra few weeks.\u201d\n\nNever Miss a Story Sign up to get the best stories straight to your inbox.

Check out more newsletters\n\nWhen she still wouldn\u2019t move, Jovanovic resorted to getting the city housing department involved and filing motions to evict her.\n\nHirschhorn, in turn, reached out to the city\u2019s Department of Building Safety, which found two code violations at the unit \u2014 that it was unapproved for occupancy and had an unpermitted shower.\n\nShe then sent a complaint to a housing investigator, alleging illegal eviction, harassment, and a refusal to pay her relocation fees.\n\nThe housing investigator concluded that because the unit violated city codes, Jovanovic had to withdraw his eviction notices until he could prove the guest house was in compliance.\n\nBut Jovanovic argues that when he tried to access the unit to make the repairs, Hirschhorn would not let him inside.\n\nHe was recently fined $660 for not complying.\n\nJovanovic is now suing Hirschhorn in two different cases: a damages complaint to recoup $58,000 in paid rent, and an appeal of the judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the eviction case.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about one ruling, it\u2019s about the entire foundation,\u201d Rucci argued. \u201cIf she\u2019s right, you can rent an Airbnb for two days and refuse to leave on the third, unless the landlord pays you to leave.\u201d\n\nBut Hirschhorn filed a countersuit in August, accusing Jovanovic of 15 violations \u2014 including negligence, nuisance, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unlawful business practices, and a violation of the LA County COVID procedures.\n\n4 Jovanovic was recently fined $660 from the city\u2019s Department of Building Safety for not complying with building codes. Instagram/@drsaschajovanovic\n\nShe claims he knew about the potential mold problem before she moved in, and that he harassed and intimidated her to leave the rental by doing unnecessary construction, placing rotting bags of trash outside her door, shutting off her hot water, and unlawfully entering the unit.\n\nAs these cases make their way through the court system, Hirschhorn is continuing to live on Jovanovic\u2019s property.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a war where no bullets are flying,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I open the door, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll be leaving at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer door is a few feet from my daughter\u2019s bedroom,\u201d Jovanovic noted. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep well anymore.\u201d"

        "title": "SPEDA mini-grant helps get historic marker for future bed and breakfast - The Lane Report",
        "content": "SOMERSET, Ky. \u2014 Krissie Reffner\u2019s aspirations for a bed and breakfast have roots that stretch back to the Revolutionary War.\n\nLocated on Ky. 461 in Shopville, Reffner\u2019s future B&B \u2014 known as the Evans House \u2014 cuts a magnificent image, the reds of its handmade brick contrasting with the blue sky on a clear day. Though it boasts a bold appearance on the outside, however, the history of this house lies quietly deep within, offering a glimpse into the origins of Pulaski County and the life of a man named Sergeant John Henry Evans, a soldier of the Revolution and lord of the house bearing his name.\n\nThose stories are what drew Reffner to the Evans House. Married with her dream of starting a bed and breakfast, it seemed to be the perfect way for Reffner to realize her dream of starting a business and making a contribution to her community. This clarity of vision made her project a natural choice to receive a mini-grant from the Somerset-Pulaski Development Authority (SPEDA), which helps small and start-up businesses innovate and grow.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw [the Evans House] on the market,\u201d Reffner said, \u201cI thought \u2018this is it.\u2019 With its history and its beauty, I knew this would be the perfect place for my dream.\u201d\n\nThe house echoes with Pulaski\u2019s past. While acquiring the Evans House, which is registered with the National Register of Historic Places, Reffner did her due diligence, spending several hours at the library to deep-dive into the mansion\u2019s lore and history.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I discovered it belonged to [John Henry Evans], who acquired the land when he left the service,\u201d Reffner said. \u201cHe did this through the Virginia Land Grant and had the largest amount of land for anyone to own in the Shopville settlement.\u201d\n\nReffner was later aided by a local lawyer when she wanted to expand her investigation into the Evans House\u2019s history, learning about the home\u2019s ownership and the sergeant\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cIn addition to his service in the Revolution,\u201d Reffner said, \u201che was a sergeant major in the War of 1812, bringing boys from the area and McCreary County to serve.\u201d\n\nShe also learned that there is a possibility that she is related to some of those soldiers, making the acquisition of the Evans House all the more special and personal.\n\nReffner has a deep desire to share what she knows about the house\u2019s history with the public, and the SPEDA mini-grant program has been invaluable to that end. With her $2,500 award, Reffner has acquired a bronze-cast historical marker to place at the entrance of the house.\n\n\u201cPeople pull up here every week asking about the house and wanting to see the graves onsite,\u201d Reffner said. \u201cThe marker will act as something to give a little background. It\u2019s important to show that history.\u201d\n\nKnowing the history behind the Evans House will help enrich the experience of visitors to the location when it eventually opens as a tavern and inn, providing patrons with a history lesson and a relaxing stay.\n\nPart of that multifaceted experience was also shaped by Reffner\u2019s love of the television series The Lost Kitchen, which focuses on a chef educating travelers from across the globe about history and cooking. That appreciation factors into her goals for the Evans House.\n\n\u201cI want to introduce foods of the era to our guests,\u201d Reffner said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have cookbooks from the 1800s and pull recipes from them and tell the history of the food while we serve it.\u201d\n\nCustomers will be able to read Evans\u2019s last will and testament, which Reffner plans to enlarge and frame, while they experience that authentic culinary immersion.\n\nReffner hopes to open the bed and breakfast and tavern in 2024, and she has a multi-year plan for her venture, expanding the menu and continuing to educate her guests about the property\u2019s history.\n\nThat spirit of education is what makes Reffner\u2019s such a unique project: she is fulfilling her dreams while giving back to her community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful to the SPEDA program to be able to put this together,\u201d Reffner said. \u201cIt is so rare to have all the pieces of a historical puzzle. We have the house and the history as a door into the life of the original owner and the time period itself. We have a chance to get a greater understanding of the people who settled Pulaski and who we are.\u201d\n\nClick here for more Kentucky Business News."
