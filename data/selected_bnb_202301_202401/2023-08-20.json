        "content": "The perpetrator who hacked Binance\u2019s internal cross-chain bridge last year and looted $570 million worth of Binance Coin (BNB) just got some of their stolen funds liquidated.\n\nIn October, the hacker in question exploited BSC Token Hub, the cross-chain bridge between the BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2) and the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nThe bad actor subsequently initiated the transfer of about 2 million BNB worth roughly $570 million at the time and deposited 920,000 BNB worth $255.89 into the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Venus to be used as collateral.\n\nAmid concerns that the BNB ecosystem would witness a cascading sell-off event if the hacker\u2019s position got liquidated on-chain, the Venus community voted in favor of a governance proposal that enabled the BNB Chain core team to manually liquidate the position.\n\nSays Venus about the proposal,\n\n\u201cIn November 2022, BNB Chain submitted a governance proposal which was passed by the community to whitelist liquidation of the BNB Bridge exploiter\u2019s position exclusively to the BNB Chain core team for the purpose of securing the misappropriated assets and preventing any further impact and sell-off from liquidating.\u201d\n\nOn August 18th, the price of BNB dropped to a low of $213.96, prompting the manual liquidation of the attacker\u2019s position to the tune of $52.3 million, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield.\n\n\u201cFollowing today\u2019s market movement, the BNB Bridge exploiter account was made healthy as promised by BNB Chain using whitelisted liquidation without any resulting shortfall or further impact to BNB.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, BNB is worth $216.69.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and a co-founder of Ethereum, has a history of teasing Ethereum and its co-founder Vitalik Buterin, but now he has stepped things up a notch, it seems. A discussion broke out about which ecosystem is better after a question was posted on \u2018X\u2019 if Cardano would ever be an Ethereum competitor.\n\nOne user said that it was telling that Ethereum had to transition to a 2.0 version of what Cardano already is today. Another argued that Cardano followed Ethereum\u2019s roadmap but was behind by years.\n\nAnd then came along an \u2018X\u2019 user who said he predicted Hoskinson would stop talking about Hydra and look towards things that Ethereum developers are doing, essentially copying from them. He added that Hoskinson would soon say that \u201cOur plan was always that if it works on Ethereum, we can just copy it, and actually, rollups and data availability have always been the future of Cardano too\u201d.\n\nHoskinson on Fire\n\nCharles Hoskinson swallowed the bait and said he felt sorry for people obsessed with their blockchain, saying, \u201cWe are living rent-free in the maxi minds. I pity them\u201d.\n\nHe reminded the original poster that Hydra, one of the recent improvements to the popular blockchain, is live and evolving rapidly. Additionally, Hoskinson stated that Mithril is now operational, marking the initial move toward an enhanced ADA and light client approach. He explained that innovative transaction methods have been developed, including tiered pricing and Babel fees. Adding that, the concept of a roll-up strategy has been in place since the inception of Midnight four years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe did not only defend Cardano but started to throw punches at Ethereum too, saying: \u201cMeanwhile Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can\u2019t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.\u201d\n\nNo matter whose side you take, it is clear that Cardano is unfinished, and there is no dispute about that. Cardano\u2019s development runs in stages and is now in the second last stage. While the current stage focuses on scaling and resource use, the final stage will see a fully decentralized community-governed ecosystem. Hoskinson thinks by then, Cardano will serve as a blueprint for other blockchains and be \u201csubstantially more decentralized than all cryptocurrencies on the market\u201d."

        "title": "'Sister Wives' Where Does Meri Brown Live Now? - TV Shows Ace",
        "content": "Sister Wives patriarch Kody Brown booted his former first wife, Meri Brown out of his life, and naturally, TLC fans wonder where she lives these days. As spoilers for Season 18 revealed that Janelle chatted with Christine about building on Coyote Pass, it can be presumed she still lives in Arizona. Meanwhile, fans know Christine lives with David Woolley near her daughters in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nMeri Brown Didn\u2019t Want To Leave Flagstaff\n\nWhen the family moved to Flagstaff, Kody planned for the Coyote Pass properties to house the entire family of four wives. Initially, he wanted one big mansion, However, Christine refused. In fact, nothing happened with the land. Only Janelle used it briefly when she stayed there in her RV. So when Kody showed Meri the door, she had to go and live somewhere else. Naturally, TLC fans would love to know where she went.\n\nMeri Brown seems more realistic about her situation in teasers for the new season of the TLC show. In one scene, she finally accepted that Kody was \u201cdone\u201d with her. That came when Garrison Brown told his mom to \u201clet Robyn have him,\u201d referring to Kody. Later, fans saw that Robyn was dissed by Kody\u2019s former first wife when she claimed the family was \u201cperfect.\u201d Describing life as \u201cperfect\u201d seemed laughable to Leon\u2019s mom. And yet she stuck around in Flagstaff, unwanted and unwelcome, for years.\n\nMeri\u2019s constant groveling is painful to watch #sisterwives \u2014 political piggy (@piggy_political) August 11, 2023\n\nSister Wives Star Kody Helped Meri Brown Recolate\n\nThe Sun reported that sources claimed Kody helped his former wife to move. She listed her home and hit the road out of Flagstaff. The outlet mentioned, \u201cThe Sister Wives star and the family\u2019s patriarch were spotted by fans at a gas stop picking up food.\u201d Putting two and two together, social media started buzzing about their destination. Anyway, a source later told the outlet that she moved to her BNB, \u201cLizzie\u2019s Heritage Inn.\u201d\n\nMeri Brown did well with her business venture in Parowan, Utah. Recall, the family didn\u2019t want to help her with any investment money. However, she went ahead without them. Actually, it might sting a bit because later, Lizzie\u2019s Heritage Inn got rated the Best Country Inn, Utah 2019. At first, her mom, Bonnie Ahlstrom managed the BNB but she passed away in 2021. These days, a friend, Jenn Sullivan manages the BNB but Meri seems to be there when she isn\u2019t traveling.\n\nDoes Kody\u2019s Ex Live Permanently In Utah?\n\nMeri Brown more than likely lives at her BNB these days. This weekend, she posted up a beautiful photo of a sunset on Instagram stories and captioned it with, \u201cUtah Sunset.\u201d\n\nCertainly, it\u2019s not the first photo of Utah that Kody\u2019s ex-wife shared. In fact, every Friday, she and her friend Jenn Suliavn do their Friday With Friends live on Instagram.\n\nHave you ever visited the inn in Parowan? Do you think that Meri Brown lives there permanently these days? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nRemember to check back with TV Shows Ace often for more news about Sister Wives."

        "title": "Baby-bed-and-breakfast helps families deal with postpartum stresses - Hudson Valley One",
        "content": "Two days after giving birth to their daughter on July 3, Catherine Mersereau and Dave Altarescu found themselves situated in a small cottage west of Woodstock with their newborn, Mila, in the middle of the woods and away from their home and families. This wasn\u2019t an accident. It was part of a carefully thought out postpartum plan that Mersereau and her husband had been mulling over for about a year in preparation for the adventures into parenthood.\n\n\u201cOver the past year I had read a lot about birth and postpartum. In all the literature I was reading, I could sense that pregnancy and birthing were fairly straightforward. But I kept hearing that people were really falling down in the postpartum period,\u201d said Mersereau. \u201cI was lucky that pregnancy was a joy. I wanted to figure out the postpartum experience.\u201d\n\nThey found what they were looking for on eight acres of forested land, a postpartum retreat also known as \u2018a baby-bed-and-breakfast,\u2019 owned and operated by Ashlie Yair of GreatFull Wellness.\n\nOriginating in countries like South Korea, the concept of postpartum retreats has given rise to a growing number of similar businesses in the United States.\n\nGreatFull Wellness\u2019 postpartum retreat provides support to new mothers and families in the aftermath of childbirth. The postpartum retreat is Yair\u2019s most recent addition to her list of other birth, in-home postpartum care, and reproductive wellness offerings. Yair, a trained doula, lactation specialist, wellness coach, and mother of three, started her integrative wellness practice to help those who had fertility challenges or those looking for better reproductive health. She sees the retreat as a service to help mothers and families build a solid foundation of physical, emotional, and mental health from the moment of birth.\n\n\u201cThis is an intensive process to learn about yourself, each other,\u201d said Yair. \u201cYou get to gain new skills and now tools for how to support yourself. It is a process where you are learning and .growing as a human.\u201d\n\nThat is for you to deal with\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Health, one in seven women in the United States can develop postpartum depression (PPD). Some health professionals believe the numbers are much higher.\n\nUntil recently, the medical world in the United States has been slow to acknowledge the seriousness and long-term effects of postpartum mood disorders like postpartum depression. \u201cPeople would be surprised to know that the effects of postpartum anxiety \u2014 and what happens in those first 30 to 40 days following a birth \u2014 influence multiple health markers for the rest of your adult life,\u201d said Yair.\n\nThere may be a subtle shift in the focus on PPD with the recent news of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approving the first-ever treatment for postpartum depression. This comes as positive news in a country where rates of PPD and maternal mortality are higher in the U.S. than in other developed nations.\n\nThough it\u2019s a step in the right direction for those suffering to have access to the necessary and immediate care of pharmaceuticals, Yair acknowledges that there\u2019s work to be done in this country to provide a more holistic system of postpartum care.\n\n\u201cAs with any mental-health challenge, we know that there are many factors that contribute to each person\u2019s mental health,\u201d Yair said. \u201cThree that we can control are first, how resourced someone\u2019s body is in regard to vitamins, minerals, and general nutrition. If someone is depleted in certain areas, they are more likely to develop mental-health challenges.\n\n\u201cSecondly, how resourced or stressed someone is in their lives, meaning how much support or lack of it is existing for the demands of the current stage of their lives.\n\n\u201cThirdly, sleep. Sleep or lack of is a huge factor in mental health.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the reality of our current society is that these will not be addressed before or after pregnancy.\u201d\n\nOverall postpartum care in the United States is considered far behind what\u2019s available in other countries. \u201cOther countries and cultures have a normalized system of postpartum care,\u201d said Yair. \u201cIn the United States, we are all in our own bubble. \u2018You had a baby. This is for you to deal with. We\u2019ll bring you a casserole, but this is on you.\u2019 People who are birthing here in this county are depleted. They feel alone. The partner might not know how to best support them.\u201d\n\nSweet bonding time\n\nEvery stay starts with a prenatal meeting beginning with extensive intake forms long before the expected due date so Yair can tailor the stay to individual families. \u201cWe were able to visit the property and meet Ashlie to start developing a relationship,\u201d satd Merseraeu. \u201cAshlie immediately felt like someone I could be vulnerable with.\u201d\n\nMost couples choose to stay five to seven days, according to Yair. The cottage can host up to four people and comes fully equipped with all the gear needed to care for a newborn and healing mother. Every meal is provided using nourishing ingredients for mother and partner. Yair sources her produce and meat from the farm next door, Zena Farmstead. Regular house chores like laundry are taken care of for the duration of the stay.\n\nAdditional services are available. A family can show up with nothing other than their adult clothing and they will have all they need,\u201d said Yair. A pop-up shop inside the cottage is supplied by the Beloved Birth and Baby Boutique in New Windsor. A pool and lounging area are available, and families are able to visit during a stay.\n\nRest is at the top of the list of priorities. If a family feels comfortable with it, Yair will take the baby for at least two hours a day so the parent(s) can get rest without hearing the baby\u2019s noises.\n\n\u201cHaving a new baby can turn our world completely upside down,\u201d said Yair, \u201cand it is challenging to find your way to the surface. The entirety of our lives comes into the birthing space and postpartum space with us, and this process can bring up things that have been long forgotten. It is challenging to navigate all of those emotions.\u201d\n\nMersereau and her husband live in Shandaken, and have family available to help out. It came as a surprise to both families when they decided to book a stay at the retreat.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that we chose to do this, but I\u2019m really happy we did. When our families came to visit us, they understood why,\u201d said Mersereau. \u201cAs soon as we came home, life intruded. That week was truly restful and supportive, and we had some really sweet bonding time.\u201d\n\nA stay at the retreat is $550 a night. A minimum three-night stay at Boram in New York City is $2300 a night.\n\nYair hopes to one day partner with investors to build a larger facility which will be able to provide a portion of in-house care on a sliding scale or at no cost. For now, Yair believes that this type of care is essential healthcare. \u201cI was a person who would not have been able to afford to stay in my cottage, and I am conscious of that every day,\u201d she said. I also believe, this is the type of care everyone deserves and it should exist for whoever can afford it now with the goal of it one day developing into something that will be accessible to a broader socioeconomic group.\u201d\n\nFor those who can\u2019t swing a stay at the retreat, options like postpartum consultations, a Wednesday-night new parents group, and virtual contacts are available.\n\nOne month into parenthood, Mersereau knows she and her husband made the right choice for herself and also her family. They found it a softer landing than going home right away. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s all just such a blur,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many people I know have had different postpartum experiences,and many wished they had known this was available.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit the Greatfull Wellness website."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrency assets suffered a scare as the price of Bitcoin nosedived to a low of $24,800 after consolidating for weeks below $30,000 as many traders and investors hoped for a rally to a high of $35,000.\n\nThe news of SpaceX selling their Bitcoin holding and China\u2019s Evergrande were huge catalysts of the crypto market suffering a scare as traders and investors speculate if the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top 5 altcoins (XRP, BNB, MATIC, DOGE, SOL) could suffer more.\n\nThe heat map above shows the cryptocurrency market could be gearing up for a short relief bounce after suffering a short decrease in the crypto prices leading many to wonder if this could spark a fresh price drop to a region of $20,000 for BTC.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price drop to a low of $24,800 led to many liquidations of over $45 Millions of assets lost across different exchanges within a few hours, as shown in the chart below.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin could still face a minor drop to a region of $24,000, acting as a strong support region for bulls and demand zone from past price performances for Bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s price retesting in this region is good for the market as long positions will be filled to drive price in favour of the bulls.\n\nIf the price of Bitcoin (BTC) loses the region of $24,000, acting as a strong area of interest, we could see bears take more control of the BTC/USDT price as the price could retest the region of $20,000.\n\nBTC/USDT must reclaim the region of $27,700 for the price to eye yearly levels of $32,000.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEthereum\u2019s price continues to look less inspiring for bulls as the price of ETH/USDT sits just above minor support of $1,650 as bulls need to hold this region to prevent further price drop to a region of $1,550-$1,400 acting as demand zones.\n\nDespite the current uncertainties surrounding the cryptocurrency market, let us examine some top 5 altcoins (XRP, BNB, MATIC, DOGE, SOL) that could show promising signs ahead of a new week as traders and investors could look to make good returns.\n\nWeekly Top 5 Altcoins \u2013 Solana (SOL) Daily Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Solana (SOL) has struggled to break past the region of $32 after bulls pushed the price of SOL/USDT to a high of $32, showing some great price action as the price dominated bears with much speculation of price rallying to $50.\n\nAfter rallying to $32, SOL\u2019s price faced a strong price rejection from bulls as the price of SOL/USDT dropped to a region of $24, where the price showed less momentum to rally higher or bears dominating its price.\n\nThe sudden drop in the crypto market led to the price of SOL/USDT losing its key support of $24 as bears pushed the price of SOL/USDT to a low of $20, acting as a key demand zone for the price of SOL/USDT.\n\nSOL\u2019s price needs to reclaim the region of $23, which corresponds to the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement value (23.6% FIB value) above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating a bullish price reversal for SOL/USDT.\n\nIf the price of SOL/USDT continues to trade below its 50-day EMA, this will indicate the bear is still in control of the price with minimal price reversal.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) looks bearish on the daily timeframe for SOL/USDT suggesting bears still dominate the price of SOL/USDT, and the price needs to show more strength to the upside to change the trend.\n\nSolana\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) trades below the 40-mark area, suggesting low buy orders and volume for the price of SOL. If bulls reclaim $23 for SOL/USDT, it would be a change in trend from bearish to bullish.\n\nMajor SOL/USDT support zone \u2013 $20\n\nMajor SOL/USDT resistance zone \u2013 $32\n\nMACD trend \u2013 Bearish\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) Daily (1D) Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Binance Coin (BNB) has had a rather tough bear market as the price has dropped from an all-time high of $686 to a low of $210 and bounced up from this region of its yearly low as bulls pushed the price of BNB coin higher.\n\nBNB\u2019s price has suffered with over 60% drop from its all-time high and the spread of different news about fear and uncertainty (FUD); these have negatively influenced the price of BNB even lower to its yearly low of $210.\n\nThe price of BNB/USDT rallied to a high of $350 but could not sustain this rally as the price of BNB/USDT was rejected by bears as bulls struggled to form strong support above this region.\n\nBNB\u2019s price dropped to a low of $230, where it was from support as price consolidated around this region before its next major move either to the upside or downside. The price drop in the market acted as a catalyst for the price of BNB as the price broke to the downside of its ascending triangle.\n\nThe breakout to the downside gave bears more opportunity to push the price of BNB/USDT to its yearly low of $210. If the price of BNB holds above this region, we could see the price retesting the high of $240, acting as resistance, corresponding to a 23.6% FIB value.\n\nBears dominate the MACD indicator for BNB shown in price, while its RSI on the daily timeframe indicates the price is oversold. The price of BNB/USDT is retesting $240, and a break above this region could mean the price rallying higher.\n\nMajor BNB/USDT support zone \u2013 $210\n\nMajor BNB/USDT resistance zone \u2013 $240\n\nMACD trend \u2013 Bearish\n\nRipple (XRP) Price Analysis as a Top 5 Altcoin to Watch\n\nAfter winning its lawsuit a few weeks ago, the price of Ripple (XRP) rallied to a high of $0.93, sparkling talks of bulls coming back sooner than expected, and the price of XRP/USDT hitting above $1.5.\n\nThe price of XRP/USDT has fallen short of the expectations of traders and investors as the price of XRP was rejected from its yearly high of $0.93 as bears expressed their strength to push the price of XRP/USDT lower.\n\nXRP\u2019s price saw price rejected to $0.68, just above its 50-day EMA, but the price failed to hold above this region as the price flipped this region into resistance by bears.\n\nThe price of XRP/USDT has since struggled below the 23.6% FIB value to show promising signs of a major rally. The price of XRP/USDT needs to close above $0.68 to resume its bullish price rally.\n\nXRP\u2019s price needs to break past its range of $0.55 for the price to retest the high of $0.68. A break and close below this range could see bears pushing the price of XRP/USDT to $0.35.\n\nThe daily RSI for XRP/USDT looks oversold as bulls need to step in for the price of XRP to have a relief bounce, while its MACD shows bearish price dominance for XRP.\n\nMajor XRP/USDT support zone \u2013 $0.45\n\nMajor XRP/USDT resistance zone \u2013 $0.55 \u2013 $0.65\n\nMACD trend \u2013 Bearish\n\nPolygon Matic (MATIC) Daily Price Analysis\n\nPolygon Matic (MATIC) has struggled to complement its great project this year and has huge investor backing as the price of MATIC/USDT suffered a price decline from its yearly high of $1.5 and has remained in a downtrend.\n\nThe loss of $1.2 support for MATIC/USDT has led to bears dominating price to a low of $0.6 as the price of MATIC bounced from this area, acting as a support zone and area of demand for investors.\n\nBulls pushed the price of MATIC from $0.6 to $0.9 as the price failed to flip $1 into support which corresponds to the 38.2% FIB value acting as resistance for the price of MATIC.\n\nThe price of MATIC losing the support of $0.6 as price trades below this region becomes an issue for bulls as bears could take advantage of this and push the price to a low of $0.4.\n\nMATIC currently trades below its 50-day EMA, MACD indicates a bearish price trend, and the RSI continues to trade in an oversold region as traders expect bulls to savage this price drop.\n\nWe could see a minor relief bounce for MATIC and other top 5 altcoins bounce to a high of $0.75 before evaluating further where the price could be headed.\n\nMajor MATIC/USDT support zone \u2013 $0.4\n\nMajor MATIC/USDT resistance zone \u2013 $0.75\n\nMACD trend \u2013 Bearish\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Price Chart Analysis\n\nDogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) price dropped from a high of $0.085 after showing signs of price breaking out from its bullish ascending triangle as it failed to meet its expectations.\n\nRumors about X ( formerly Twitter) incorporating DOGE as a payment means for influencers have had little to no effect on the price of DOGE/USDT as bears continue to show their prowess driving the price in a downtrend.\n\nThe sharp decline in the market over the past few days has contributed to the price of DOGE breaking below its key support of $0.07, corresponding to 23.6% FIB value and its 50-day EMA acting as support regions.\n\nDOGE needs to hold its price above $0.06 to avoid bears pushing prices lower than expectations as MACD and RSI continue to indicate a bearish price trend for DOGE as bulls would aim for a relief bounce in the coming days or weeks.\n\nMajor DOGE/USDT support zone \u2013 $0.06\n\nMajor DOGE/USDT resistance zone \u2013 $0.075"
