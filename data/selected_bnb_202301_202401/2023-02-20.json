        "title": "PancakeSwap Burns $30M in CAKE as Trading Volume Picks Up - Coinfomania",
        "content": "PancakeSwap, the leading decentralized exchange on the BNB Chain, has just announced the burn of over 7 million units of its native cryptocurrency, CAKE. The tokens subjected to the burn were worth $30 million.\n\nWhat is Token Burn?\n\nToken burning is a process of removing portions of a particular cryptocurrency from the circulating supply. This reduces the total number of that cryptocurrency and increases demand. Token burning is one way cryptocurrencies can combat inflation. Examples of cryptocurrencies implementing the burn mechanism are Binance coin and Ethereum.\n\nIn PancakeSwap\u2019s case, the token burn can be attributed to its rebound in trading volume. CAKE saw an average daily trading volume of around $153 million in the past month. Since the start of February, however, the value has increased. On February 7, for example, CAKE saw a trading volume of $317 million within 24 hours.\n\nCurrent data shows that the token has a daily trading volume of around $215.8 million.\n\nPancakeSwap\u2019s Token Burn Breakdown\n\nPancakeSwap shows the breakdown of the token burn. Trading fees derived from swaps and perpetual saw 189,000 CAKE tokens burnt. Prediction and lottery services saw 71,000 and 30,000 CAKEs, respectively, get burnt. The project\u2019s NFT market recorded a 26% reduction as 566 CAKEs got burnt.\n\nData on the price aggregator platform, CoinGecko, shows that PancakeSwap has a total supply of about 370 million. This is a little over half the maximum supply of CAKE, which sits at 750 million, as shown in the revised tokenomics of the protocol.\n\nThis is not the first time PancakeSwap has conducted a crypto burn. The token-burning mechanism dates back to 2022, when the protocol saw regular burns. The last burn occurred on January 30, 2023, and removed 7 million units of the protocol\u2019s cryptocurrency. At that time, the total CAKE tokens were worth $29 million.\n\nCAKE Records 13% Increase\n\nDue to bearish trends, CAKE held a trading price between $3 and $3.5 during January. This is a massive 94% decrease from its all-time high of $43.9 in April 2021.\n\nAt the time of writing, CAKE trades at $4.3, representing a 13% increase from its price a month earlier.\n\nImage: Midjourney"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nRace Kingdom, a Metaverse racing gaming platform, is elated to announce the launch of its second batch of camel NFTs.\n\nAccording to the Race Kingdom team, the second batch of Camel NFTs consists of 999 uniquely designed and meticulously crafted NFTs. These NFTs will have numerous new qualities and features, including genetic profiles and 3D visuals that will be helpful during breeding and game races. Their enhanced uniqueness comes from combining four genera and four rarities from the performance attribute they fall under within the game.\n\nThe Camel NFTs will serve numerous utilities within the gaming platform, including giving holders access to game rewards, racing tournaments, breeding, sweepstakes and renting opportunities.\n\nNotably, users will start accessing the Camel NFT on OpenSea from March 2 2023. During this period, a floor price in the primary market for these NFTs will grant holders access to a mystery box. The mystery box will have an ultra-rare camel with the highest values from the four performance attributes. This NFT can potentially return investments by almost 120x in the secondary market.\n\nOmar Gull founded Race Kingdom as a metaverse racing game featuring camel avatars. Camel racing dates back to the 7th century CE and has been a common practice across the Arabic region, especially during ceremonies, sports and social gatherings. Recently, blockchain-powered digital racing creatures such as horses, camels and snails have become a popular trend. Race Kingdom offers a one-stop shop that eliminates the difficulties experienced in many Web3 gaming platforms. The platform already has an in-game token, $ATOZ, that act as both as an in-game native currency and as an independent token with out-of-game value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRace Kingdom will launch its alpha gameplay in the first quarter of 2023. Race Kingdom plans to offer a wide range of NFT creatures and racing arenas in the coming days. Race Kingdom hopes to become a multilingual metaverse by offering multiple languages, including but not limited to English, Tagalog, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Vietnamese.\n\nCommenting on the new Camel the NFTs, Omar Gull, founder and CEO of Race Kingdom, stated:\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to offer fans and collectors the chance to own a piece of the exciting world of Race Kingdom. We have accomplished the two key milestones per our roadmap \u2013 the launch of a native token, $ATOZ and now the launch of camel NFTs. We look forward to rolling out the alpha gameplay this quarter. Our tech team has been working hard developing the game and different race tracks. I believe blockchain gaming has a huge potential and will play a tremendous role in wider web3 and crypto adoption.\u201d"

        "title": "Airbnb host justifies leaving a chore list and charging a cleaning fee - here's why - New Zealand Herald",
        "content": "A neighbour has complained to Auckland Council after the Grey Lynn Airbnb next door was the site of what she described as a source of noisy parties and a constant flow of strangers. Video / Supplied\n\nLast year travellers noted a disturbing trend in holiday rentals and BnBs.\n\nThe year 2022 saw the rise of the BnB chore list, with some guests noticing Airbnb house rules listing a rising number of \u201cto dos\u201d among the terms of rental. In some cases these greeting guests on arrival, laminated and waiting on the kitchen table.\n\nThis has ignited a fierce debate as to whether hosts should be both charging cleaning fees to guests and asking them to do housework.\n\n\u201c$700 for two nights \u2260 no chores!\u201d summarised TikToker @Melworeit. The traveller and her husband were shocked to see the lengthy list of tasks they were expected to do, while being charged the equivalent of an extra night in service fees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the principle that really bothers me,\u201d she said.\n\nLaundry, gardening and mowing lawns: Guests want to know why the are doing chores but still being charged for cleaning. Photo / Kyle Arcilla, Unsplash\n\nA $125 cleaning fee is pretty rich, having already asked guests to perform the services of a general factotum.\n\nSome were on the more reasonable end of the spectrum - like, taking out the rubbish on the way out - others seem to be abusing the goodwill of guests. Some guests have reported being asked to wash their hosts\u2019 laundry or even mow the lawn.\n\nThere is no limit to the lengths people will go for a \u201cfive-star\u201d rating.\n\nOther travellers, particularly in the United States, complained about what they termed a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d: chores, a hefty cleaning fee and an empty envelope for tips.\n\nThe tip envelope is the \u201cmost audacious\u201d of the three, Reddit user Prittjam wrote to the Airbnb forum.\n\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m paying a cleaning fee and doing chores on my vacation before an early flight, and you want me to leave a tip for the cleaners, too? Where is that money really going?\u201d\n\n$700 for two nights \u2260 no chores: Travellers have been pushing back on lengthy, unusual chores from Airbnb hosts. Photo / TikTok, Melworeit\n\n\n\n\n\nAirbnb hosts agree that there\u2019s a huge misunderstanding on how the fees work and what the money goes towards. The home economics of running a guest house isn\u2019t as simple as one might hope.\n\nHosts say service fees in particular are treated with suspicion by guests.\n\nThe right type of guests\n\nAirbnb host Michelle Burson says it is perfectly understandable to charge a cleaning fee and still expect guests to help out with chores.\n\nGuests would baulk at the $480 service fee at the end of stays, she told Insider magazine, but that was simply the cost of professional cleaning the 370-square-metre mansion in Oregon. However, most were happy to pay a higher nightly rate, upfront.\n\n\u201cWe had people reaching out that they were interested, but they wanted us to do something about the cleaning fees, so we had to find a balance between the two.\u201d\n\nThe report found an increase in fake reviews from hotels when Airbnb was a competitor. Photo / Unsplash\n\nA higher cleaning fee can lead guests into thinking that they have already paid enough for cleaning and taking less care of the property, especially for large groups.\n\n\u201cRaising the price of the property and lowering the maximum capacity also brought in a more respectful type of guest.\u201d\n\nAsking a couple of token tasks of guests upfront can help attract more desirable guests and fewer large groups who just want to party. She still charges $240 a stay in cleaning fees.\n\n\u201cWe ask our guests to do two chores before they leave,\u201d says Burson.\n\nGetting guests to strip beds of linen and take out the rubbish helps to keep cleaning costs down and mess in check for the cleaners.\n\nThe putting out of bins is a bit more of an issue for the Oregon property, in the heart of bear country.\n\nIf guests don\u2019t take their waste out between lets, there\u2019s a chance that a big old grizzly might come looking for it before the cleaners do.\n\nAll rentals have their quirks. Guest chores reflect this."
