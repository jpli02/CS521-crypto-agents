        "content": "Major FUD has struck the crypto market as controversy triggers around the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Latest reports suggest that Binance is struggling to maintain its position amid current regulatory developments and has been selling Bitcoins in order to abate the BNB price drop.\n\nEarlier this week on Tuesday, the BNB price tanked under $210 levels with its year-to-date losses extending above 30%. There\u2019s a fear brewing in the crypto space that an FTX-like situation could pan out with Binance if the BNB price crashes further.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmid these developments, the Bitcoin price is also witnessing some selling pressure with a push under $26,000. Crypto analyst Mike Alfred suggests that if Binance were to suspend withdrawals, Bitcoin can actually bounce back strongly forming a god candle. He wrote:\n\n\u201cCZ is dumping Bitcoin again today trying to hold up the value of BNB. It\u2019s not working. BNB is bleeding out. I expect a $200 break, potentially within 48 hours. After Binance shuts withdrawals for all customers, BTC will rally. Could even see a God candle. Will be fun\u201d.\n\nBinance (BNB) Coin to Drop Under $200?\n\nThe BNB price has bounced back from yesterday\u2019s low of $205. As of press time, Binance (BNB) Coin is up 2.5% trading at $213 with a market cap of $32.9 billion.\n\nBut analyst Alfred believes that the BNB price can further drop under $200. He said: \u201cHard BNB bounce at $204 back over $205 and the BTC sell pressure magically relents. CZ\u2019s affiliated market makers are not doing a very good job masking this behavior. It\u2019s too obvious\u201d.\n\nOther market players have also joined in the Binance criticism. Popular trader Peter Brandt wrote: \u201cI have stated for years that CZ and @binance is a global scam and $BNB just a cheap fiat. Watch it all unravel\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say anything at this moment, however, the crypto market is awaiting an assurance from Binance chief Changpeng Zhao who has yet to comment on the developments."

        "content": "The Binance coin has been in aggressive correction mode since August\u2019s second week. From a high of $248, the coin\u2019s market value tumbled 16.7% and reached the current trading price of $206. This high momentum breakdown has recently breached the monthly support of $200, indicating that crypto holders may witness further downfall. Should you sell on this?\n\nAlso Read: Venus Protocol Faces Binance Coin (BNB) Liquidation Risk\n\nadvertisement\n\nBinance Coin Daily Chart: Key Points\n\nThe $220 support breakdown sets altcoin for a 10% drop\n\nA bullish breakout from the overhead resistance will signal a change in market sentiment.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in the BNB coin is $545.4 Million, indicating a 30% loss\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nAmid increasing bearishness in the crypto market, the BNB price gave a massive breakdown from the $220 support on August 17th. After a minor retest phase, the coin price tumbled 6.7% in the last three days and currently exchange hands at $206.\n\nHowever, the daily time frame chart shows no significant support before the $200 level indicating the BNB price posed for another 10%. The buyers will retest this support after a year and should provide a strong footing for potential investors.\n\nWhile the selling momentum is aggressive it\u2019s too early to expect a reversal from the aforementioned support. However, for interested traders, a better confirmation for a recovery rally or trend reversal would be a breakout from the overhead trendline.\n\nCan Binance Coin Recovery Back to 350?\n\nThe daily time frame chart, a descending trendline has marked the current correction trend in BNB price. The altcoin has turned down thrice from the resistance trendline indicating the traders are aggressively following selling at bullish bounces. Thus a bullish breakout from the barrel could bolster buyers for the first $350\n\nBollinger Band: The BNB price challenging the lower band Bollinger Band indicator reflects high momentum selling among trades.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The daily RSI slope at the oversold region indicates a high possibility for a bullish reversal."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Wednesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The SOL token saw the biggest loss in the top 10, while BNB saw the biggest gain, despite reports that Binance is violating Russian sanctions.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$26,000 following Evergrande\u2019s bankruptcy\n\nSOL falls to six-week low, BNB leads gainers despite reports of violating Russian sanctions\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token fell 1.68% in the 24 hours to 4:30 in Hong Kong to a six-week low of US$20.79, as the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, bringing its weekly losses to 11.13%. The token is down over 41% for the year, but losing the US$20 support level could return SOL to June\u2019s low of US$14.49.\n\nBNB rose 2.77% over the past 24 hours to US$215 on Wednesday, as the day\u2019s biggest gainer, but remained close to its yearly low of US$204 registered on Tuesday. The token continues to face downward pressure amid Binance\u2019s mounting regulatory issues and ongoing lawsuit with the SEC.\n\nA Tuesday report by the Wall Street Journal claimed that Binance, the world\u2019s largest exchange, is helping Russians transfer funds from sanctioned banks into balances on their platform, adding to investor concerns. Binance denied the allegations, saying that it has no relationships with any banks in Russia, in relation to its peer-to-peer trading program.\n\nBitcoin rose 0.4% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$26,052 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it briefly fell below the US$26,000 mark earlier today.\n\nEther rose 0.79% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,644 but fell 9.78% during the past week.\n\nDespite the market slump, the infrastructure being built, such as PayPal\u2019s new stablecoin, will significantly improve global crypto adoption, according to Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\u201cMarkets might not be pricing in the impact of PayPal\u2019s stablecoin until it clearly gains traction, but it could be a key step in spurring the adoption of the Ethereum ecosystem. We expect more stablecoin innovation and issuance as global regulations accommodate this monetary\n\ninnovation, breathing life into the crypto economy,\u201d wrote Coutts in a research note shared with Forkast.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.26% to US$1.05 trillion while market volume increased 26.89% to US$35.52 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nForkast 500 refreshes all-time low after former OpenSea employee was sentenced for insider trading\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.79% to 2,295.68 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong marking a new all-time low for the index. All other FOrkast Labs indexes posted losses for the day.\n\nThe troubles continued for OpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, after a former product manager at the marketplace was sentenced by a U.S. district court to three months in jail on Tuesday, for insider trading. He was found guilty of fraud and money laundering in May for using confidential information about the platform to profit from NFT trades.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales fell 2.72% to US$8.83 million, as the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, lost some of yesterday\u2019s momentum, with sales falling 47.04% to US$1.5 million. Yet, sales of its twin collection, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, rose 38.10% to US$587,493, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nDraftKings, a Polygon-based NFT project, fell to become the fifth-largest collection across all chains, but its 24-hour sales volume rose 49.20% to US$486,705.

The corporation is building itself into a leader in A.I. technology and introduced its latest generative A.I. model \u2014 Ernie 3.5 \u2014 in June 2023.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures rose for a second consecutive day on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all posting gains.\n\nThese gains came ahead of chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s earnings report, scheduled for later today. Nvidia share prices were down 2.77% to US$456 after yesterday\u2019s rally, despite HSBC raising its price target to US$780.\n\nOn the corporate front, investors are anticipating earnings reports from Analog Devices, Snowflake, Autodesk, NetApp and Splunk, scheduled for later today.\n\nInvestors are also looking ahead to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday.
