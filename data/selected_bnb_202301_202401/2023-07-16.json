        "content": "Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, is a city adorned with an abundance of exceptional bed and breakfasts. Steeped in history, these B&Bs are often housed in beautifully preserved historic buildings, providing guests with a glimpse into the architectural heritage of the city. Whether you seek proximity to iconic landmarks such as the Lincoln Memorial, National Mall, and White House, or prefer the tranquility of residential neighborhoods like Dupont Circle and Woodley Park, Washington, D.C.\u2019s B&Bs offer a range of choices that cater to every traveler\u2019s preferences. Prepare to embark on an unforgettable stay, immersing yourself in the rich tapestry of the capital\u2019s history, culture, and warm hospitality. With numerous options to choose from, the only question is, which enchanting B&B will be your home away from home?\n\n\n\nDid you know \u2013 Culture Trip now does bookable, small-group trips? Pick from authentic, immersive Epic Trips, compact and action-packed Mini Trips and sparkling, expansive Sailing Trips.\n\nSwann House Historic Dupont Circle Inn\n\nWho\u2019d have thought you could get this cozy in the capital city? This self-styled urban inn is an inviting 19th-century mansion in a peaceful spot near Dupont Circle with 12 lavishly decked-out rooms. All are different, some with four posters (the Parisienne Suite) or the Zen-inspired Shanghai\u2019daway (see what they did there?) with richly colored fabrics, dark furniture and a luxurious travertine-tiled shower. Public spaces are awash with period features including crystal chandeliers and elaborately carved fireplaces. In summer, cool off in the courtyard pool.\n\nGeorgetown Inn\n\nThis collection of restored 18th-century red-brick townhouses wows history and luxury lovers alike: its 96 light-filled boutique rooms feel fresh, with fluffy, white monogrammed bathrobes, pretty mirrors and smart headboards. You\u2019re close to genteel Georgetown\u2019s famous university, so expect students and visiting parents among the guests. Try the chicken pot pie at 1310 Kitchen & Bar, the on-site all-day brasserie-style restaurant. If you\u2019re really impressed, there\u2019s a recipe book to take home with you.\n\nThe Kalorama Guest House\n\nRed brick and blue trim mark the exterior of this simply styled B&B (in two separate buildings) in the leafy Woodley Park neighborhood, which is just minutes\u2019 walk from the sprawling Smithsonian National Zoological Park. You can expect to sleep soundly in Kalorama\u2019s pared-back rooms with their dark drapes and agreeable wooden furniture, before rising to breakfast at the communal dining table. Expect to be invited to freshly baked cookies and lemonade each afternoon.\n\nAdam\u2019s Inn\n\nHere you\u2019re in the heart of the lively and diverse residential Adams Morgan neighborhood. Take a morning cuppa on the porch or in the sweet gardens enjoying the ambience of the tree-lined street. It\u2019s all about the homely vibe here. Some rooms go bold with brightly painted walls, others feature characterful wood paneling and have scenic garden views. The Carriage House Suite has its own garden entrance. Grab a bagel in the breakfast room before you explore the city sights. The closest is the African American Civil War Memorial & Museum, less than 2mi (3km) away.\n\nLedroit Park Renaissance Bed and Breakfast\n\nFans of period charm love this 1890s row house in a residential area home to many famous Black scientists, poets and musicians. The welcome starts with the pretty flower boxes at the windows. Interiors salute the building\u2019s era with original wooden floors, a knick-knack topped fireplace, tables topped with sparkling crystal glassware and ornately framed paintings. If you fancy checking out more such charming DC districts, the bus to Georgetown, DC\u2019s oldest neighborhood, is just across the street.\n\nBecome a Culture Tripper! Sign up to our newsletter to\n\nsave up to $1,656 on our unique trips. Sign up See privacy policy.\n\nMalolo Bed and Breakfast\n\nThis Marshall Heights home-from-home reflects its family-friendly neighborhood. Tropicality infuses comfortable rooms with beds of palm-leaf patterned throws, colorful headboards (yes, lime green in one) and warm full-length robes. Breakfast and dinner are a treat here, whisked up by a Cordon Bleu-trained chef with a passion for adding a twist of Pacific Rim to his dishes. After a breakfast burrito or eggs to order, spice up your day further with a thrilling trip to the Six Flags America theme park, alive with rides, shows and attractions, a 15-minute drive away.\n\nWoodley Park Guest House\n\nFans of history and a homely stay will love this pink-bricked family-run B&B with the warmest of welcomes. It was built in 1907 as a posh residence in aptly named verdant Woodley Park, before becoming a B&B during World War II. Persian rugs in deep shades of berry red, vivid art and wing-back chairs create a relaxed environment (similar to sister property Embassy Circle Guest House) in individually decorated rooms. Breakfast on farm-fresh eggs and organic toasted bread at the smart, starch-clothed communal table in the dining room."

        "title": "Malibu\u2019s Barbie DreamHouse Airbnb Got a Kenergy Makeover \u2014 Here\u2019s How to Get the Look at Home - Hollywood Reporter",
        "content": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nThe real-life Barbie DreamHouse is reopening its doors in Malibu soon \u2014 but this time, the three-story Airbnb promises big Kenergy. The seaside property with panoramic views first went up for rent in 2019, and Ken has redecorated the bright pink pad ahead of Greta Gerwig\u2019s highly-anticipated Barbie film.\n\nDreams will come true for up to four people on Monday, July 17 starting at 10 a.m. PT, when reservations open up for the Malibu DreamHouse on Airbnb.com. Up for grabs are two free one-night stays for up to two people each night on July 21 and 22.\n\nRelated: From Balmain to Gap, The Best Barbie Fashion Collabs for Making Pink Your Power Color\n\nIn the newly renovated \u201cKendom,\u201d lucky guests can snooze in a tufted seashell bed, which is now covered in Ken\u2019s Western bedding. The closet is filled with looks ready for Venice beach or the rodeo, such as fringed cowboy shirts, animal print button-downs and more of Ken\u2019s favorite things mixed in with a few of Barbie\u2019s wardrobe essentials. (Note that the pieces are for dress-up only.)\n\nCourtesy of Joyce Lee/Airbnb\n\nGuests can have a splash into the oceanview pool, but they won\u2019t be able to ride down the two-story slide \u2014 because just like in Barbie Land, some things are just plastic. Other slightly off-reality touches in the Kendom include a poolside fire pit, the Ken-ecue (he\u2019s done away with the Barbie-cue), a disco roller rink with a DJ deck and a rooftop gym featuring jars of Ken\u2019s Beefy Body Brine (the workout weights, however, are as heavy as in the Real World.)\n\nRelated: The Best Hollywood-Famous Airbnbs From Movies and TV Shows\n\nUnlike most Airbnb rentals, guests will get to take home a pair of Impala neon skates \u2014 which are now sold out online \u2014 and surfboards, similar to the ones seen in the movie. Those who score the reservation will be responsible for getting themselves to Malibu. (It might be a good time to call up Pilot Barbie.)\n\n\u201cAs you probably know, I\u2019m a beach guy \u2014 and Malibu is the ultimate oceanfront paradise, with its never-ending sunshine (don\u2019t forget your cowboy hat and sunscreen!), beaches as far as the eye can see, and surf shops everywhere,\u201d writes Ken in the listing. \u201cNearby, you\u2019ll find every beach activity you could ever dream of: sunbathing, shopping, surfing, and the best boardwalks for rollerblading (thank me later). This place is selfie central too, so be sure to snap some photos along the way.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Joyce Lee/Airbnb\n\nStarring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Barbie follows the iconic pink-loving protagonist as she faces an existential crisis and leaves Barbie Land (in her pink Chevrolet Corvette convertible, no less!) for the Real World. Co-written by Gerwig and partner Noah Baumbach, the romantic comedy also stars Kate McKinnon, Dua Lipa, Issa Rae, Ritu Arya, Michael Cera and Emerald Fennell as Mattel dolls in the flesh and America Ferrera, Helen Mirren, Will Ferrell and others as humans.\n\nRelated: The Best Barbie Beauty Collabs, from Travel-Friendly Hair Dryers to Under-$15 Makeup\n\nAirbnb will celebrate the film with a donation to Save the Children to support equal access to learning resources for children, families and communities in over 100 countries. The funds will help \u201cto build girls\u2019 confidence and help them excel in school \u2013 ensuring everyone has equal opportunity to achieve success,\u201d per a release.\n\nWhile only a handful will realize their DreamHouse, uh, dreams, anyone can deck out their digs in Barbiecore. Mattel and the Warner Bros. film continue to roll out collaborations to promote all things Barbie (as they have been for the last year). Below, shop some of the official movie merch and other popular pink picks inspired by the film, and don\u2019t forget to set your alarm for July 17 at 10 a.m. PT and try your luck at booking the DreamHouse here.\n\nAlexander Home Faux Cowhide Rug Ken\u2019s Western devotion is seen in the Barbie DreamHouse bedroom, which boasts a faux cowhide rug similar to this one.
