        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nBNB price continues to slide, falling 1.6% to $211.45 in the past 24 hours, 11% in a month and almost 28% in a year.\n\nBNB Statistics:\n\nToday\u2019s Price \u2013 $213\n\nMarket cap \u2013 $32.80 Billion\n\nCirculating supply \u2013 153,849,274 BNB\n\nTotal supply \u2013 153,849,274 BNB\n\nCoinmarketcap ranking \u2013 4\n\nBNB Price Analysis\n\nIf the price stays above the moving averages for 30 and 50 days in the next few days, the price could rise to $250 or higher. BNB\u2019s price may face resistance around $233.9 but if it stays below that point it will may find support around the current level at $211.\n\nBNB\u2019s RSI is at 40, indicating a possible drop in price. RSI signals and moving averages indicate potential price decreases for BNB. Look out for the support level at $211 and the RSI-14. It could rise if the price breaks the first resistance level and the RSI-14 goes above 50.\n\nWith BNB in the doldrums, an interesting alternative is the Wall Street Memes presale, which gives investors a good opportunity to buy before WSM launches on the DEX exchange in just 17 days.\n\nPromising Alternative to BNB\n\nYou can buy Wall Street Memes currently for $0.0337.

        "content": "Investors are increasingly exploring new digital assets beyond the traditional heavyweight, Bitcoin (BTC). Binance Coin (BNB) and Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) have garnered attention among these alternatives for their profit potential.\n\nWhat is BNB?\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) first emerged as a digital currency designed to reduce transaction costs within the largest crypto exchange by volume, Binance. Its role, however, has since evolved far beyond mere fee reduction. Today, the BNB coin serves as the backbone of the thriving BNB Chain ecosystem, enabling the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Its utility extends to providing liquidity on the Binance Liquid Swap, enabling participation in token sales on the Binance Launchpad, supporting charitable initiatives through Binance Charity, and more.\n\nBNB price prediction\n\nThe BNB price tested the $235 resistance before a downturn against the US Dollar. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $220 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. Analysts suggest this pair might continue to move down unless there is a close above $225.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Spark?\n\nBitcoin Spark is a blockchain that seeks to usher in a new era of crypto transactions. The BTCS token powers Bitcoin Spark and serves several functions within the ecosystem.\n\nBTCS can be used to create or utilize smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Bitcoin Spark will include a smart contract layer with separate execution systems that all reach finality on the main network. This approach allows for the use of both high-level and low-level programming languages, allowing for scalability and diversity of the smart contracts and DApps on the platform.\n\nPerhaps the most striking use case of BTCS is granting access to decentralized CPU/GPU power. Bitcoin Spark uses a proprietary and groundbreaking consensus mechanism known as the Proof-of-Process (PoP), which non-linearly rewards users for confirming blocks and providing processing power. The Bitcoin Spark network is lightweight, with a massive number of nodes. This, combined with the nonlinear rewards functionality, allows it to accommodate many validators, even those with low-powered devices. The network\u2019s native application will enable Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, and Android users to participate in validation by permitting secure and isolated access to their device\u2019s processing unit. It is the validators\u2019 collective processing power that will be safely channeled to organizations and individuals requiring large amounts of remote computational power. BTCS will serve as the payment currency for this service, and the revenue generated will be distributed among the network validators.\n\nFurthermore, the BTCS token can be used to get advertising services. The Bitcoin Spark application and website will have unobtrusive slots for advertisements, which will be community-policed to ensure the credibility of Bitcoin Spark and the posted ads. Advertisers will pay with BTCS, and network participants will receive 50% of the revenue generated in addition to incentives for policing the ads.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS) profit potential\n\nSeveral factors suggest BTCS could provide significant profits to its investors and traders. First, its innovative technology and real-world applications suggest potential for significant adoption, which leads to substantial price increases. Additionally, BTCS has a limited supply of 21 million, which bodes well for its long-term price movement, as can be seen by Bitcoin (BTC). In fact, the Bitcoin Spark has been hailed as a second chance for those who missed out on early Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin Spark is in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) stage, which offers a chance to get significant returns with little initial investments. The project\u2019s low market cap paves the way for unprecedented price surges, and its launch being in sync with the next crypto bull run further cements this notion. BTCS will launch at $10 but is currently selling at $2.25, accompanied by a 10% bonus in Phase 4 of the ICO. This denotes a 489% profit even before BTCS gets to the market.\n\nConclusion\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) and Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) represent intriguing options for investors seeking significant profits. Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on individual preferences and risk tolerance.\n\nFor more information on Bitcoin Spark:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"

        "title": "The Binance Chain (BNB/BSC) SWOT Analysis - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Note: a SWOT analysis is an evaluation of the fundamental, operational, technical, social, economic, and even to some degree administrative elements of a project. This is not a model to be used for trading purposes. (NFA, DYOR)\n\n\n\n\n\nComposed of four elements, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, a SWOT analysis framework provides excellent insight for establishing a high-level understanding of the state of a project's well-being through the lens of a birds-eye view.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can help formulate decisions around which areas require more attention, set performance goals, and organize a foundational understanding of where a project is headed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRarely (if ever) used in crypto, it is time to apply this timeless method of evaluation to the digital asset space.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Binance Chain (BNB), a domineering brand in Web3 and a multi-chain blockchain framework composed of an EVM-compatible layer 1, decentralized storage, consensus, and scalability sidechains, will get a SWOT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcaa Strengths (Internal) (Helpful)\n\n1. Brand Recognition\n\nBinance is the most popular brand in crypto, blockchain, and Web3 on the scale of global retail. For nearly every sector of crypto, from centralized and decentralized exchanges to gambling and wallets, Binance is the best-recognized black and yellow brand. From Russia to China, to Singapore, to the UAE, and everywhere in between, Binance reigns supreme. For years, the consistency of interweaving BNB into every cultural aspect of crypto (such as Bitcoin Pizza Day, where Binance makes BNB-branded goodies; or shoots well-thought-out social videos of black and yellow Lambos) has transformed the project into one associated with the very foundings of crypto on the world stage as we know it today.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Business Development Relationships\n\nBinance's business development is second to none. They negotiate well, build strong, life-long relationships, and understand who they must be building with. Recently, Layer Zero has proven to be infinitely valuable to Binance as they brought so much new on-chain activity (roughly ~25% of transactions are attributable to Layer Zero's integration of Stargate). Beyond the technological, Binance has built incredible affiliations with world-class superstars such as Christiano Ronaldo (who hosted an NFT sale through Binance) and other non-crypto specific influencers that expand the scope of Binance beyond crypto and ultimately help the Web3 industry onboard new users.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Development of New Validator Model\n\nCurrently sitting at 29 validators (up from 24 the year before), Binance has begun to aggressively pursue the decentralization of its ecosystem with the implementation of BEP-131, BEP-153, and BEP-159. These three improvement proposals create a more favorable environment for the staking and validator selection mechanisms. Targeting to grow the set to 100 validators translates to a higher degree of asset and governance distribution; Ultimately creating a more resilient and equitable environment that is more robust to handle regulatory issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Cult-Like Community\n\nPossibly bolstered through very sophisticated botnets, Binance is without a doubt one of (if not THE) crypto projects with a social presence full of the most die-hard extreme community members. From the brand itself, extending to the CEO (CZ), the community of BNB/BSC users is raving and supporting the ecosystem without worry of recourse. Few communities (besides Bitcoin) have such committed audiences that their involvement borders on insanity. Surely, this is a massive benefit to the project; they can basically weather any storm knowing there will be a foundational group of users that will evangelize BNB no matter what happens. While this may seem harsh or skeptic, it is obviously an expression of psychological mastery on behalf of the project product and marketing/community-building efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Pancake Swap\n\nPancake Swap originated as a DEX in the Binance ecosystem. Since its inception, it has grown to become a multi-chain tool (Ethereum, Linea, Base, Polygon, and many others). By becoming an important actor in facilitating on-chain exchange, Pancake Swap has accrued TVL over $1,300,000,000 USD. Considering the vast majority of that is attributable to Binance chain, Pancake Swap is holding roughly 30% of all the network's liquidity. Certainly, that is a very high concentration, but it is lower than its previous levels of over 40%.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Strong Burn Mechanism\n\nBurning has become of the few widely adopted economic modules for digital assets that exert tremendous supply-side pressure. While there are arguments regarding the exact implementations of it and whether or not the implications of it are properly effective, the six years of a burning mechanism present in BNB has removed ~46 million tokens from circulation, considering that the total max supply was 200 million, to begin with, that translates to nearly 25% of the entire supply being no longer available. When measuring against the token's historic performance and the anticipated perpetual burn rate of 1.1% year-on-year, burning might prove to be one of the most powerful forces for driving ecosystem growth over long enough time frames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude1e Weaknesses (Internal) (Harmful)\n\n1. Ecosystem Application Nature Binance has defined itself as a powerful brand with high-quality features and a strong social presence. The external ecosystem of solutions that build on Binance, for some odd reason, predominately carry weak brands, lack the intellectual finesse present in other environments, and tend to lean to design principles that are, at the least to say, nonsensical. So many of the newer generation projects are primarily forks or trashy clones of other successful projects, don't have a remote idea of a genuine, logical economic model, prey on the general stupidity of retail consumers, and do not appeal to first-world players. *I won't name these projects because I have incredible respect for any founders that might just need more time to optimize themselves, but if you would just look at most launchpad projects or projects less than a year old on the BNB chain, you will find that 9/10 are idiotic; what's more insane is that 8/10 will have raised money somehow\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Low Nakamoto Coefficient Everybody should already understand that Binance is a centralized project. There is nothing wrong with centralized projects (except for, of course, the risks of malicious intentions that might be undesirable for end users and the fact that the SEC will have stronger cases to pursue some kind of legal recourse), but the main issue with Binance's centralization is that they incessantly bill themselves as being decentralized. The Nakamoto coefficient is a rough measure of a network's decentralization in terms of the threshold of validators that must be manipulated in order to overthrow the network. In the case of Binance (which has 29 validators), the Nakamoto coefficient is 8; ranking it at the very low end, teetering towards a higher degree of centralization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddd0 Opportunities (External) (Helpful)\n\n1. External Support Initiatives\n\nBinance is possibly the most supportive layer one network for all of the projects that try to build on top of it. Hosting a multitude of hackathons, incubators, accelerators, grants, and bounty programs, Binance has attracted so many burgeoning ideas with its brilliant marketing and attractive incentives. Builder grants, Gas grants, MVB accelerator, Zero-2-Hero, Kickstart, and countless other initiatives are helping early-stage projects bootstrap themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Low TVL\n\nWith around $3 Billion USD in total value locked across a small group of applications, the amount of value locked on chain is ~9x lower than the project's market cap. The 1:9 ratio produces mixed signals (positive and negative); however, given the macro backdrop of declining global market values and TVL on every chain and platform, the current TVL foreshadows a potential explosion upwards, which would then likely exert positive pressure on all assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Low Application Diversity With just a handful of applications dominating Binance chain by measures of value locked, volume produced, gas fees generated, and unique active addresses involved, there is a large gap in the market for better solutions to arrive on Binance's network. Not long ago, Uniswap bridged to BSC, and yet Pancakeswap still holds an outsized portion of TVL. Given how much ecosystemic support Binance provides, it is highly likely (if not inevitable) that better products will eventually arrive and supercharge the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude33 Threats (External) (Harmful)\n\n1. SEC Clampdown\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the SEC has thrown full force at the overall Binance ecosystem, claiming they have been engaging in illegal operations, including offering trading/sales of unregistered securities, including their own native BNB token. Contrary to traditional targeting, even the CEO of Binance has become a focal point of witch-hunting.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Executive Board Resignations\n\nStarting way back in 2021 with the resignation of the Binance US CEO Cathy Coley, followed by the quick arrival and short-lived departure of Brian Brooks, directors for every department of the company have been jumping ship at an insane rate. Over the course of 2023 alone, more than 10 people with mission-critical roles in the organization have voluntarily stepped away from their positions. From product leads to marketing to strategy to compliance, have left the organization one after the other. While there could be (and have been arguments made for both sides of the situation), the loss of so many key people can easily spill over into massive operational friction that arises by not having the qualified professional talent helping steer the continuing evolution of the project. Now time and resources must be spent educating new people into these roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. BUSD Debacle Binance implemented its own stablecoin, BUSD (Binance USD), through the use of a trusted, regulated issuer, Paxos. Suddenly, in February of 2023, NYDFS (the New York Department of Financial Services) forced Paxos to halt its issuance of BUSD on the grounds that they will be sued by the government for dealing with an unregistered security. This single issue drained over $1 billion USD from Binance Chain's stablecoin network value and allowed Tether to swoop in and become the dominant stablecoin on the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaway:\n\nFrom its humble beginnings as a crypto-to-crypto exchange that went live through an ICO back in 2017, Binance is one of the strongest brands in the entire industry. As it pertains to a crypto asset brand, Binance is, without a doubt, the Leader. Being the leader means that you will attract a lot of attention, a lot of it good, the majority of it not so good.\n\n\n\n\n\nBinance is flush with trash at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing that I cannot get over, its projects are raising money on a concept that does not need a token at all, but what's worse is that these degenerates put \"Burning\" as a token utility\u2026 Why would you give money to something stupid enough to consider burning a utility? Burning is a monetary policy to control the supply-side dynamics of a digital asset. Not a utility. I can rant about this for days, but let's just move on.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the ecosystem of ghost projects, Binance continues to be a powerhouse in the industry. Regardless of whether you want to discuss the centralized exchange side or the \"decentralized\" blockchain ecosystem, Binance has made a permanent mark on the Crypto industry\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe current state of Binance is delicate\u2026 But I am cautiously optimistic.\n\nThe history of the project, its social acuity, intelligent leadership, effective marketing, and quality products all incline me to believe Binance will be here regardless of what the FUD may indicate in the near term.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll said and done, Binance is only suffering right now due to regulatory problems, in spite of which the platforms continue to operate, and (so far) all user funds have been SAFU.\n\nThe larger the problem Binance lives through, the more resilient it becomes to future events. Navigating its current problems would ultimately propel Binance into the \"too-big-to-fail\" caliber.\n\n\n\n\n\nWould I personally invest in BNB?\n\n\n\n\n\nVery, very carefully, and only through a DCA approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems having some BNB/BSC just to always have access to the network for bridging, emergency trading, or getting paid in stablecoins and then moving them elsewhere is such a no-brainer; in fact that is probably best practice for overall being able to operate in Web3.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you know something that I don't or feel as though I might have missed anything worth noting, please do share, I would tremendously appreciate some feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for reading, I hope this serves you well on your journey.\n\nLive long and prosper \ud83e\udd42"

Development of New Validator Model\n\nCurrently sitting at 29 validators (up from 24 the year before), Binance has begun to aggressively pursue the decentralization of its ecosystem with the implementation of BEP-131, BEP-153, and BEP-159. These three improvement proposals create a more favorable environment for the staking and validator selection mechanisms. Targeting to grow the set to 100 validators translates to a higher degree of asset and governance distribution; Ultimately creating a more resilient and equitable environment that is more robust to handle regulatory issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Cult-Like Community\n\nPossibly bolstered through very sophisticated botnets, Binance is without a doubt one of (if not THE) crypto projects with a social presence full of the most die-hard extreme community members. From the brand itself, extending to the CEO (CZ), the community of BNB/BSC users is raving and supporting the ecosystem without worry of recourse. Few communities (besides Bitcoin) have such committed audiences that their involvement borders on insanity. Surely, this is a massive benefit to the project; they can basically weather any storm knowing there will be a foundational group of users that will evangelize BNB no matter what happens. While this may seem harsh or skeptic, it is obviously an expression of psychological mastery on behalf of the project product and marketing/community-building efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Pancake Swap\n\nPancake Swap originated as a DEX in the Binance ecosystem. Since its inception, it has grown to become a multi-chain tool (Ethereum, Linea, Base, Polygon, and many others). By becoming an important actor in facilitating on-chain exchange, Pancake Swap has accrued TVL over $1,300,000,000 USD. Considering the vast majority of that is attributable to Binance chain, Pancake Swap is holding roughly 30% of all the network's liquidity. Certainly, that is a very high concentration, but it is lower than its previous levels of over 40%.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Strong Burn Mechanism\n\nBurning has become of the few widely adopted economic modules for digital assets that exert tremendous supply-side pressure. While there are arguments regarding the exact implementations of it and whether or not the implications of it are properly effective, the six years of a burning mechanism present in BNB has removed ~46 million tokens from circulation, considering that the total max supply was 200 million, to begin with, that translates to nearly 25% of the entire supply being no longer available. When measuring against the token's historic performance and the anticipated perpetual burn rate of 1.1% year-on-year, burning might prove to be one of the most powerful forces for driving ecosystem growth over long enough time frames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude1e Weaknesses (Internal) (Harmful)\n\n1. Ecosystem Application Nature Binance has defined itself as a powerful brand with high-quality features and a strong social presence. The external ecosystem of solutions that build on Binance, for some odd reason, predominately carry weak brands, lack the intellectual finesse present in other environments, and tend to lean to design principles that are, at the least to say, nonsensical. So many of the newer generation projects are primarily forks or trashy clones of other successful projects, don't have a remote idea of a genuine, logical economic model, prey on the general stupidity of retail consumers, and do not appeal to first-world players. *I won't name these projects because I have incredible respect for any founders that might just need more time to optimize themselves, but if you would just look at most launchpad projects or projects less than a year old on the BNB chain, you will find that 9/10 are idiotic; what's more insane is that 8/10 will have raised money somehow\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Low Nakamoto Coefficient Everybody should already understand that Binance is a centralized project. There is nothing wrong with centralized projects (except for, of course, the risks of malicious intentions that might be undesirable for end users and the fact that the SEC will have stronger cases to pursue some kind of legal recourse), but the main issue with Binance's centralization is that they incessantly bill themselves as being decentralized. The Nakamoto coefficient is a rough measure of a network's decentralization in terms of the threshold of validators that must be manipulated in order to overthrow the network. In the case of Binance (which has 29 validators), the Nakamoto coefficient is 8; ranking it at the very low end, teetering towards a higher degree of centralization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddd0 Opportunities (External) (Helpful)\n\n1. External Support Initiatives\n\nBinance is possibly the most supportive layer one network for all of the projects that try to build on top of it. Hosting a multitude of hackathons, incubators, accelerators, grants, and bounty programs, Binance has attracted so many burgeoning ideas with its brilliant marketing and attractive incentives. Builder grants, Gas grants, MVB accelerator, Zero-2-Hero, Kickstart, and countless other initiatives are helping early-stage projects bootstrap themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Low TVL\n\nWith around $3 Billion USD in total value locked across a small group of applications, the amount of value locked on chain is ~9x lower than the project's market cap. The 1:9 ratio produces mixed signals (positive and negative); however, given the macro backdrop of declining global market values and TVL on every chain and platform, the current TVL foreshadows a potential explosion upwards, which would then likely exert positive pressure on all assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Low Application Diversity With just a handful of applications dominating Binance chain by measures of value locked, volume produced, gas fees generated, and unique active addresses involved, there is a large gap in the market for better solutions to arrive on Binance's network. Not long ago, Uniswap bridged to BSC, and yet Pancakeswap still holds an outsized portion of TVL. Given how much ecosystemic support Binance provides, it is highly likely (if not inevitable) that better products will eventually arrive and supercharge the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude33 Threats (External) (Harmful)\n\n1. SEC Clampdown\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the SEC has thrown full force at the overall Binance ecosystem, claiming they have been engaging in illegal operations, including offering trading/sales of unregistered securities, including their own native BNB token. Contrary to traditional targeting, even the CEO of Binance has become a focal point of witch-hunting.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Executive Board Resignations\n\nStarting way back in 2021 with the resignation of the Binance US CEO Cathy Coley, followed by the quick arrival and short-lived departure of Brian Brooks, directors for every department of the company have been jumping ship at an insane rate. Over the course of 2023 alone, more than 10 people with mission-critical roles in the organization have voluntarily stepped away from their positions. From product leads to marketing to strategy to compliance, have left the organization one after the other. While there could be (and have been arguments made for both sides of the situation), the loss of so many key people can easily spill over into massive operational friction that arises by not having the qualified professional talent helping steer the continuing evolution of the project. Now time and resources must be spent educating new people into these roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. BUSD Debacle Binance implemented its own stablecoin, BUSD (Binance USD), through the use of a trusted, regulated issuer, Paxos. Suddenly, in February of 2023, NYDFS (the New York Department of Financial Services) forced Paxos to halt its issuance of BUSD on the grounds that they will be sued by the government for dealing with an unregistered security. This single issue drained over $1 billion USD from Binance Chain's stablecoin network value and allowed Tether to swoop in and become the dominant stablecoin on the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaway:\n\nFrom its humble beginnings as a crypto-to-crypto exchange that went live through an ICO back in 2017, Binance is one of the strongest brands in the entire industry. As it pertains to a crypto asset brand, Binance is, without a doubt, the Leader. Being the leader means that you will attract a lot of attention, a lot of it good, the majority of it not so good.\n\n\n\n\n\nBinance is flush with trash at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing that I cannot get over, its projects are raising money on a concept that does not need a token at all, but what's worse is that these degenerates put \"Burning\" as a token utility\u2026 Why would you give money to something stupid enough to consider burning a utility? Burning is a monetary policy to control the supply-side dynamics of a digital asset. Not a utility. I can rant about this for days, but let's just move on.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the ecosystem of ghost projects, Binance continues to be a powerhouse in the industry. Regardless of whether you want to discuss the centralized exchange side or the \"decentralized\" blockchain ecosystem, Binance has made a permanent mark on the Crypto industry\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe current state of Binance is delicate\u2026 But I am cautiously optimistic.\n\nThe history of the project, its social acuity, intelligent leadership, effective marketing, and quality products all incline me to believe Binance will be here regardless of what the FUD may indicate in the near term.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll said and done, Binance is only suffering right now due to regulatory problems, in spite of which the platforms continue to operate, and (so far) all user funds have been SAFU.\n\nThe larger the problem Binance lives through, the more resilient it becomes to future events. Navigating its current problems would ultimately propel Binance into the \"too-big-to-fail\" caliber.\n\n\n\n\n\nWould I personally invest in BNB?\n\n\n\n\n\nVery, very carefully, and only through a DCA approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems having some BNB/BSC just to always have access to the network for bridging, emergency trading, or getting paid in stablecoins and then moving them elsewhere is such a no-brainer; in fact that is probably best practice for overall being able to operate in Web3.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you know something that I don't or feel as though I might have missed anything worth noting, please do share, I would tremendously appreciate some feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for reading, I hope this serves you well on your journey.\n\nLive long and prosper \ud83e\udd42"
