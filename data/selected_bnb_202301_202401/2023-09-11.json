        "title": "Deeper than beds and breakfast: Preserving a piece of Gainesville\u2019s rich history - The Independent Florida Alligator",
        "content": "On April 7, 1971, Joe Montalto\u2019s life changed forever. He met his future wife and business partner, Cindy. Twenty years later, the pair opened The Magnolia Plantation, Gainesville\u2019s first bed-and-breakfast.\n\nOnly a 10-minute drive from UF lies one of Gainesville\u2019s hidden gems: the historic bed-and-breakfast district. With a rich history and eclectic aesthetics, these inns have provided a unique travel experience to Gainesville visitors for 32 years.\n\nGhosts, hippies, Tom Petty and some members of his first band, Mudcrutch, have inhabited these inns long before they became temporary homes to travelers passing through.\n\nEach bed and breakfast has a different resurrection story. Joe, 69, and Cindy, 68, had different ideas when they were looking for property to buy in Gainesville. Joe is a \u201cvisionary\u201d and Cindy is a realist, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen we pulled up to the front of the house, when we first were looking at it, Joe said at the exact same time I did\u2013He's like, \u2018This is the house,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Oh hell no I'm not going in there,\u2019\u201d Cindy said.\n\nThe house is a standing time capsule, decorated with black and white family photos, baptismal outfits and 11-year-old Joe\u2019s red Soap Box Derby car. Their collie, Annie, sits in the summer kitchen where Cindy makes breakfast every morning for guests while their adopted stray cat, Turtle, wanders the property throughout the day.\n\nEvery detail was thought out, Joe said. Each room is named after one of their female relatives. The main house\u2019s kitchen is made completely out of Gainesville Cypress trees.\n\nCindy and Joe were the catalysts that prompted the bed and breakfast district\u2019s redevelopment. The area was run down when they moved in. Originally, the couple purchased just the main house, which was littered with couches, mattresses and a pile of \u201ccrusty\u201d clothes taller than Cindy, she said.\n\nThe couple credits themselves with starting the \u201csucker club,\u201d a club made up of family, friends and guests they\u2019ve convinced to move to the district and surrounding areas. Their latest convert is a doctor and nurse couple who moved in six years ago, Joe said.\n\n\u201cOur biggest coup is sucker number 18, which is right on the other side of that fence there, we now have a doctor and a nurse,\u201d Joe said. \u201cRight through that gate, we get free medical attention anytime we want.\u201d\n\nJoe and Cindy worked around the clock to restore the French Second Empire Victorian house, the only of its kind in Gainesville, Joe said. The couple outsourced work for the electrical, plumbing and air conditioning, but did everything else alongside a carpenter who worked with them six days a week.\n\nJoe and Cindy opened their inn in 1991, and while they had success, it was difficult to get students in the surrounding areas to quiet down, Joe said. To combat this, the couple bought some of the surrounding builds in the first 10 years of being open.\n\nEnjoy what you're reading?

The noise generated by the pond blocked out a little bit of college student rumble.\n\nAs the neighborhood developed and the couple grew the \u201csucker club,\u201d the college voices started to fade out, Joe said.\n\nTwo years after Cindy and Joe opened The Magnolia Plantation, Cornelia Holbrook, 60, opened The Sweetwater Branch Inn. Two minutes from The Magnolia Plantation, it has 29 rooms spread through 13 buildings on a 2-acre property.\n\n\u201cWe took old, dilapidated, unrestored, otherwise unsightly buildings\u2014historic treasures, actually\u2014and made them into something useful,\u201d Holbrook said.\n\nThe inn serves a wide variety of purposes. Its eccentric rooms differ wildly from hotels because every room is uniquely decorated and no detail is a coincidence, she said.\n\n\u201cThe rooms in one of the houses are named after roses, and then the rooms in McKenzie house are named after famous women that I love,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn't want to put numbers on them.\u201d\n\nIn 1978, Holbrook\u2019s mother, Giovanna Holbrook, purchased the McKenzie Home\u2014one of the two Victorian-era mansions on the current property\u2014with her husband, Juan. Named after the previous owner, Mary McKenzie, the couple restored the home, but they had trouble renting it out.\n\nBecause of this, Giovanna moved into the McKenzie Home in 1982. However, Cornelia Holbrook had always dreamed of opening an inn, she said. When the opportunity arose, Giovanna bought the Cushman-Colson House, which was right next door to the McKenzie home.\n\n\u201cI had seen my parents restore a couple of Victorian homes and I thought, \u2018Oh, that would be wonderful,\u2019\u201d Holbrook said. \u201cIt was a good fit.\u201d\n\nIn 1992, Holbrook began restoring the Cushman-Colson House to its Victorian glory, which was no easy feat, she said. The house was purchased after a fire from its previous inhabitants.\n\nThe Cushman-Colson house was a commercial property and therefore required a contractor to tackle the restoration, but Holbrook was there every step of the way.\n\n\u201cI did a lot of refurbishing of the woodwork and the fire mantles and antique doors, and I did all the interior design,\u201d she said. \u201cI started out with just five guest rooms, so it was tiny.\u201d\n\nIn 1993, she opened the Sweetwater Branch Inn, and in 1998, Giovanna moved out of the McKenzie Home, and Holbrook added five more rooms to the inn.\n\nHolbrook, while not a professionally trained chef, has cooked in various kitchens her whole life, and made breakfast for guests at the inn for 28 years, she said. Recently, she took a step back from morning preparations to focus on her 14-year-old son.\n\nNow 31 years in, Holbrook reflects on her struggles through the decades. Battles with ghosts, Airbnb and COVID-19 have forced inn owners to fight to keep their historic preservations alive, she said.\n\nMultiple guests have checked out because of a mischievous spirit that would move picture frames or mess with light fixtures, she said. Holbrook wants the record to show that the Sweetwater Branch Inn is no longer haunted after a spiritualist helped the \u201clost soul\u201d find its way home, she said.\n\nPrevious inhabitants at the Laurel Oak Inn, owned by Susannah Peddie, were much more human. Tom Petty and another member of Mudcrutch lived at the Laurel Oak Inn when it was still a four-unit apartment building, and the area was known as \u201cHippie Hill\u201d around 1969.\n\nThe Laurel Oak Inn was renovated for stability by Butch and Joyce Redstone and was bought by another couple in 1999, who restored the house to its Victorian-era designs. It became operational in 2001 and has had different owners over the years, but Peddie, 46, took over the inn earlier this year. She also took over the Camellia Rose Inn in 2023, she said.\n\nPeddie manages multiple properties in Gainesville, either as a bed and breakfast or an Airbnb, with her business partners who live in South Florida, she said.\n\nPeddie is trying to modernize the bed and breakfast concept. Her inns provide a continental breakfast from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. where travelers can come and go at their leisure. She aims to cater to the modern traveler, but admires the unique experience bed-and-breakfasts can offer, she said.\n\n\u201cIt's wonderful because it preserves some history of Gainesville, and these are not cookie-cutter motels, hotels. I mean, each room is different,\u201d she said. \u201cYou're not going to get character from any other hotel or motel or any other accommodation in Gainesville,\u201d Peddie said.\n\nThe bed and breakfast concept is a tough business to run, and most only last a few years, Cindy and Joe Montalto said. The couple owns Gainesville\u2019s longest-running bed and breakfast. But they do it together.\n\n\u201cI couldn't imagine doing this without him,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cI wouldn't want to do it by myself, it\u2019s not fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't want to be with anybody except for her,\u201d Joe responded.\n\nTheir legacy is not the inn they\u2019re eventually going to leave behind, they said, but it\u2019s the impact they\u2019ve left on the neighborhood and its people.\n\nContact Ella @ethompson@alligator.org.

        "title": "Meme Coins Or Utility Tokens? \u2013 a Deep Dive Into Bitcoin Spark - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nA fundamental question often raised in crypto is whether to go for the meme thrill or infuse in utility tokens that offer practical value and innovation. A deep dive into Bitcoin Spark sheds light on the distinctions of meme coins versus utility tokens, providing valuable insights into the unique qualities and promises that Bitcoin Spark unveils.\n\nWhat is a meme coin?\n\nA meme coin is a cryptocurrency deriving its name and popularity primarily from internet memes, social media trends, or viral content. These coins often feature fun and lighthearted branding, logos, or themes, contributing to their appeal among online communities. Meme coins are typically not intended to serve as serious financial instruments or long-term assets; instead, they serve as entertainment, satire, or experiments in cryptocurrency technology. Creating a meme coin is relatively easier than developing a comprehensive blockchain project. This low barrier to entry allows for the rapid creation of meme coins. The success of meme coins often relies on the strength of their online communities. Enthusiastic supporters and online influencers like Elon Musk promote and popularize these coins. Most meme coins lack substantial utility beyond speculative trading. They may not offer unique technological features, use cases, or real-world applications. Prominent examples of meme coins include Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and SafeMoon (SAFEMOON). While these coins have garnered attention and even achieved substantial market capitalization, they are often considered highly speculative assets and should be cautiously approached.\n\nWhat is a utility token?\n\nAdherents need to distinguish between meme coins and utility tokens. Utility tokens are cryptocurrencies designed to serve specific functions or provide solutions within blockchain ecosystems. Meme coins may capture the excitement of the internet, but utility tokens are typically built for more practical and sustainable purposes within the cryptocurrency landscape. Unlike some cryptocurrencies, which primarily serve as digital assets, utility tokens are intended to provide access to specific services, products, or functions within a decentralized network. Utility tokens grant holders access to a platform\u2019s features, services, or products. For example, they might be used to pay transaction fees, access software applications, or participate in a decentralized network\u2019s governance.\n\nThey can incentivize users to engage with and contribute to a blockchain network. For instance, BTCS users earn tokens as rewards for validating transactions, participating in staking or providing computational resources. Utility tokens have a defined purpose within the ecosystem, such as enabling smart contract execution, voting on protocol upgrades, or accessing data storage and computation services. Examples of utility tokens include Ether (ETH) on the Ethereum network, used to pay for transaction fees and smart contract execution, and Binance Coin (BNB) on the Binance Smart Chain, which provides various utility functions within the Binance ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS): The Ultimate Utility Solution\n\nBitcoin Spark positions itself as the ultimate utility solution within the cryptocurrency space. It strives to achieve this by offering a combination of features and functionalities that enhance its utility for users and participants within the network. Bitcoin Spark employs a hybrid consensus mechanism combining the features of both PoW and PoS. The platform\u2019s Proof-of-Process hybrid approach balances security, decentralization, and energy efficiency. PoW involves miners using computational power to validate transactions and secure the network, while PoS allows token holders to participate in network governance and validation. This combination enhances the network\u2019s stability and security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBTCS\u2019 special algorithm through the Bitcoin Spark application ensures that rewards are distributed fairly among network participants, regardless of their processing power or stake size. This approach prevents a concentration of power and rewards in the hands of a few, promoting a more decentralized network.\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s users can customize the allocation of their resources, such as CPU and GPU processing power. This feature allows for greater flexibility and control over mining capabilities, aligning with the goal of inclusivity. Bitcoin Spark operates with a high degree of transparency, aligning with the principles of blockchain technology. Users can verify transactions on the public ledger, and the network\u2019s operations are open for scrutiny, as evidenced by smart contract audits and KYC certifications.\n\nBitcoin Spark plans to be compatible with other blockchain networks, dApps development, and BTCS wallet, reinforcing its utility as a bridge between various blockchain ecosystems.\n\nBitcoin Spark is in phase four of its fast-paced ICO, offering one BTCS at $2.25, with a 10% bonus and expected ROI of 489%. The launch will be on November 30 at $10.\n\nMore BTCS details here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nVisit BTCS ICO: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets were majorly trading lower in Monday's trade. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 0.20% to $25,808, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was below the 1,650 level.\"The overall crypto market experienced losses, and Bitcoin briefly dipped below $26,000. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is on the verge of a \"death cross,\" where its short-term 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is about to dip below its long-term 200-day SMA, said CoinDCX Research Team.Other top crypto tokens were also trading lower. XRP Dogecoin , Polkadot and Solana declined over 1%.The global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower, around $1.04 trillion, falling 0.32% in the last 24 hours.The total volume in DeFi is currently $1.6 billion, 7.9% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $18.37 billion, which is 90.87% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.The market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $503 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 48.65%, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, BTC volume stood at approximately $8.41 billion, rising 45.94% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin price analysis reveals it is at its lowest since June, struggling around $25,800. Bulls are aiming to break the $26,000 resistance for a potential rally, but a break of $25,500 could lead to further losses,\" Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO of Unocoin, said.Bitcoin has been trading in a relatively tight range around the $26,000 level, and market indicators are sending mixed signals, making it difficult to determine whether the bulls or bears currently have the upper hand. The downsloping moving average suggests a bearish trend, but the positive divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) indicates a potential reduction in selling pressure.Bitcoin continues to trade sideways from $25,500 to $26,500 with low volumes. The bulls are defending the crucial support level of $25,000 (Horizontal Trendline & 50% Fibonacci retracement Level). If it holds and sustains above the support then we may expect the bulls to resume the up move whereas a break below the support will lead to further downfall. $32,500 will be the major hurdle for bulls and to witness a rally BTC needs to break, close and sustain above the resistance level of $32,500.Quick Glance (Source: coinmarketcap.com , data as of 12:40 hours, IST on September 11, 2023)Bitcoin $25,808 -0.20%Ethereum $1,614 -0.71%Tether $0.9997 -0.01% BNB $211 -0.72%XRP $0.4918 -1.69%Cardano $0.2478 -0.64%Dogecoin $0.06165 -0.88%Solana $18.28 -1.42%Polygon $0.5217 -1.24% Litecoin $61.48 -0.64%Polkadot $4.13 -1.33%Tron $0.07921 -0.07%Shiba Inu $0.000007365 -1%(Note: Price change in last 24 hours)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
