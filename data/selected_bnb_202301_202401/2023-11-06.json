        "content": "TL;DR\n\nXRP has overtaken Binance Coin (BNB) to become the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, spiking to $0.71 and reaching a market capitalization of about $37.8 billion.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether remain the top three, with Bitcoin approaching a $700 billion market cap and Tether hitting a record high market cap over $85 billion.\n\nXRP\u2019s price rally are partly attributed to Ripple\u2019slegal victories against the SEC, with experts suggesting a potential further rally if Ripple wins the trial next year.\n\nRipple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 has surpassed Binance Coin (BNB) and became the fourth largest cryptocurrency (in terms of market capitalization).\n\nThe former has spiked to a fresh three-month high of $0.71 (per CoinGecko), registering a 12% increase on a daily basis.\n\nIts market cap has soared to approximately $37.8 billion (as of the moment of writing these lines), whereas BNB is fifth with less with $37.7 billion.\n\nThe top three positions seem reserved for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT). The market cap of the leading digital asset is inching closer to $700 billion, whereas its closest rival has recorded around $227 billion.\n\nAs CryptoPotato reported earlier today, the largest stablecoin \u2013 USDT \u2013 set a new all-time high of over $85 billion.\n\nOne major reason behind XRP\u2019s impressive rally in the past few weeks could be the developments surrounding the lawsuit between the blockchain enterprise and the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nRipple appears to have the upper hand after securing three partial court victories against the regulator. Multiple experts believe a decisive win for the crypto firm in the trial next year could trigger an additional XRP rally.\n\nThose curious to see how the asset might perform in the last quarter of 2023 could take a look at the video below:"

        "title": "XRP Close to Surpassing BNB After Massive 9% Price Spike - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nXRP has made a significant move, surging 9% to reach an intraday high of $0.68, according to market data provided by CoinGecko.\n\nIt is now close to surpassing BNB by market capitalization. The cryptocurrencies are valued at $37.4 billion and $36.5 billion, respectively.\n\nThe controversial token, which is associated with San Francisco-based blockchain company Ripple, has now managed to hit its highest level since Aug. 2.\n\nHowever, the token is still far away from reclaiming its yearly high of $0.93 which was achieved on July 13. This surge came after a federal judge ruled in favor of Ripple Labs in a closely watched case with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The court determined that XRP sales were not securities, except in specific cases involving institutional sales.\n\nDespite a substantial plunge to as low as $0.42 on August 17th, XRP's price has recovered remarkably, now boasting an almost 60% increase since mid-August.\n\nXRP's price outperformance\n\nComparatively speaking, XRP's recent performance has outshone its peers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have shown relatively modest movements, with BTC decreasing slightly by 0.2% and ETH remaining stable, XRP has climbed by 22.9% over the past week.\n\nBNB's 7.6% gain also falls short of XRP's leap, setting the stage for a potential shift in rankings if the upward trend continues for Ripple's native token.\n\nUptick in whale holdings\n\nAccording to data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment, XRP has not only increased in price but also in the interest among larger-scale investors, commonly referred to as \"whales.\"\n\nTheir data indicates that wallets holding between 100,000 to 1 billion XRP now contain their highest level of the token in 2023, a sign of growing confidence from significant investors.\n\nThis uptick in whale holdings coincides with a substantial transfer reported by Whale Alert. A whopping 23.8 million XRP, equivalent to over 15.6 million USD, was moved to the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nThe narrative around XRP has turned increasingly positive following the legal clarity provided by the recent court ruling. However, caution remains as the crypto markets are known for their unpredictability."

        "content": "A massive surge in the past week made XRP overtake Binance coin (BNB) as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency industry matures, the open market continues to pick the biggest winners, a shift often reflected by a change in the rankings of the top assets by market capitalization. In one such rare change, the price of XRP overtakes Binance coin (BNB) as the fourth largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap data, BNB boasts a market cap of $37.1 billion, with XRP now above BNB with $37.2 billion. It is noteworthy that XRP bridged the gap between its market cap and BNB\u2019s in the past week with a substantial 22% rise.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOver the same period, BNB only gained 7%, having struggled to keep up with the rest of the market since a bullish wave returned in October. BNB is trading at $244 at the time of writing, representing a 0.12% decline in the past 24 hours. In contrast, XRP has risen by 10% and has both technical and fundamental indicators in its favor to experience further growth.\n\nA Tale of Differing Fortunes\n\nXRP\u2019s race to overtake BNB as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency tells a tale of differing fortunes. Precisely, the surge in XRP prices has largely been attributed to Ripple enjoying multiple victories in its legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe courts have ruled in Ripple\u2019s favor twice, determining that XRP is not a security when sold on a secondary market and denying the SEC\u2019s bid to appeal that major decision. Evidently, that pair of losses prompted the regulatory body to withdraw its pending cases against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. It has also increased investor belief that a settlement is on the horizon.\n\nHowever, Binance has had little headway in its legal issues with the SEC. Recall that in June, the SEC sued Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, for securities law violations. The move, which caused the price of BNB to drop significantly, has also impeded its growth even with a broader crypto market recovery.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBNB is still down 1% on the year-to-date (YTD) chart compared to XRP, which has more than doubled its price since January. XRP opened the year trading at $0.33 but sits around $0.681 at press time."

        "content": "Binance Coin (BNB) has experienced a notable resurgence in the last few weeks, sparking a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency market. With its versatile applications and growing popularity, BNB has captured the attention of influential investors, leading to a surge in on-chain activities that have stirred the digital asset community.\n\nThe latest developments surrounding BNB reveal intriguing movements within the crypto space, particularly with the recent actions of a prominent whale investor.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nDefensive Moves: XRP Bulls Firmly Shield $0.66 Before Ripple Swell 2023 7 months ago\n\nWhale\u2019s Strategic BNB Acquisition And Deployment\n\nAccording to a recent report shared by Lookonchain, a significant whale recently acquired a substantial amount of BNB, totaling 22,319 coins valued at a staggering $5.6 million. In an unexpected move, the whale swiftly withdrew the acquired BNB from the Binance exchange over the course of the last three days.\n\nRather than holding the assets, the whale strategically injected these tokens into liquidity pools on both Biswap and PancakeSwap, aiming to generate additional revenue through trading fees.\n\nThe #BinanceBlockchainWeek is coming soon! The price of $BNB has increased by 10% in the past week. A whale withdrew 22,319 $BNB($5.6M) from #Binance in the past 3 days and provided liquidity on #Biswap and #PancakeSwap to earn trading fees.https://t.co/dQTc7OUNp2 pic.twitter.com/GIzxVT9mvF \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 6, 2023\n\nThe implications of this large-scale BNB movement have been manifold, triggering notable fluctuations in the coin\u2019s price and market positioning.\n\nAt the time of reporting, BNB is trading at $245, experiencing a minor dip of 2.2% in the last 24 hours. However, this dip comes amidst a significant seven-day rise of nearly 10%, indicating the ongoing dynamic nature of BNB\u2019s value within the market.\n\nWhile these fluctuations are not uncommon within the volatile crypto sphere, the recent whale activity has certainly played a pivotal role in shaping BNB\u2019s current trajectory.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAnalyzing ADA Solid 25% Gain: Signs Point To Cardano Rally Ahead 7 months ago\n\nBNB market cap currently at $37.414 billion on the 24-hour chart at TradingView.com\n\nMarket Impact: BNB\u2019s Price Volatility\n\nThe significance of the whale\u2019s strategic investment and subsequent actions on Biswap and PancakeSwap cannot be understated. By adding a substantial amount of BNB to the liquidity pools, the whale has effectively contributed to the overall liquidity and trading volume of these platforms, potentially enhancing the overall ecosystem for BNB and other associated tokens.\n\nThis move not only demonstrates the growing confidence in BNB\u2019s potential but also highlights the increasingly diverse strategies that influential investors are employing within the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nBNB price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko\n\nAmidst these developments, BNB recently faced a temporary setback as XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, briefly surpassed BNB in terms of market capitalization, relegating BNB to the fifth position.\n\nHowever, the setback proved to be short-lived as Binance Coin swiftly reclaimed its fourth spot from XRP, underscoring its resilience and enduring appeal within the competitive cryptocurrency market.\n\nWith growing investor interest and strategic maneuvers shaping its trajectory, BNB\u2019s chart in the coming months is poised to be a compelling narrative within the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.
