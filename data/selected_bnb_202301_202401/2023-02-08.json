        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAlex McCurry, the CEO of Solidity.io \u2014 a blockchain-based platform for smart contract audit and token development \u2014 has taken a potshot at Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and other meme-inspired cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to McCurry, these canine-themed cryptos are all \u201cgarbage\u201d. His comment was in response to a tweet that observed that Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Baby Doge, Floki Inu, and others had outperformed crypto market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).\n\nThese so-called dog cryptos have captured the hearts and minds of crypto enthusiasts in recent years owing to their meteoric rise that turned many retail speculators into overnight millionaires.\n\nNonetheless, there are lingering concerns about whether these joke tokens will have any lasting value despite ones like Dogecoin already proving skilful at pushing powerful narratives that have grabbed the attention of American rapper Snoop Dogg, Kiss co-lead singer Gene Simmons, and even Tesla/Twitter CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThis is not the first time a knowledgeable crypto insider is slamming doggy-themed cryptocurrencies. Last month, Steven Cooper, Bigger Entertainment\u2019s CEO, accused SHIB of being a pyramid scheme. He argued that the lack of burnt tokens or any real achievements shows that the blockchain project is just used as a cheap token to lure people to invest their money into dubious spinoffs such as BONE, a governance token and the main token emitted as yield rewards within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCooper, who had worked tirelessly to burn Shiba Inu coins via his music playlists and merch between 2021 and 2022, deleted every single mention of SHIB on his social media platforms. Cooper also had a falling out with SHIB developers and has no desire to be involved again with the \u201cDogecoin Killer\u201d.\n\nNotably, the team behind SHIB has been trying to help the token shed its meme coin status and develop into a fully-fledged crypto ecosystem. Developers are building Shiba Inu\u2019s layer-2 network, dubbed Shibarium, to operate atop Ethereum. If everything goes as planned, the launch could contribute to strong fundamentals for the second most popular dog-themed cryptocurrency after Dogecoin.\n\nWith a market cap of over $8.2 billion, Shiba Inu is currently the world\u2019s 13th biggest cryptocurrency."

        "content": "At its January meeting, the Sonoma Planning Commission approved a new permit for Don and Nancy Sebastiani to use their Fourth Street East estate as a bed and breakfast, allowing up to four parties to stay at the 12,800-square-foot mansion at a time.\n\n\u201cMy parents built this home in 1986 with the intention to host friendly and family gatherings,\u201d Mia Coakley said, representing her parents Don and Nancy Sebastiani. \u201cNow that that their grandchildren are moving off to college and they have less use for their home.\u201d\n\nCoakley says her parents do not have any immediate plans for the property along the 100 block of Fourth Street East, but they hoped to create more opportunity for people to visit the estate that sits across from their namesake winery. And while they may not be listing the property just yet, as of Feb. 4 (15 days after the planning commission\u2019s vote), they\u2019re permitted to welcome guests.\n\nCoakley described the home as the \u201cepicenter\u201d of her family\u2019s life \u2013 her mother held prayer groups there, her father held a monthly wine tasting with friends and Mia herself was married at the estate.\n\nBut talk of opening what has long been the Sebastiani family home to the public has caused some neighbors to bristle at the idea of a bed and breakfast in a residential neighborhood.\n\nRight next door, the Sebastianis operate an expansive six-bedroom short-term vacation rental, also called Casa Sebastiani, that\u2019s listed on websites like VBRO and AirBnb for $1,500 to $1,900 per night. Short-term vacation rental permits have been prohibited in city limits since 2017. Bed and breakfasts, on the other hand, are a different story.\n\nSupport with a side of apprehension\n\nSeveral neighbors shared fears about the potential impact a mini hotel could create during the Jan. 19 planning commission meeting.\n\nDonna Cohn-Payne, a Fourth Street East resident, said she has been disrupted by the family\u2019s private events over the past 20 years \u2013 but opening up the property to the public was a step too far.\n\n\u201cWe hear everything, every summer,\u201d Cohn-Payne said. \u201cThis is a 12,000-square-foot home. And while they say its four bedrooms, 7.5 baths, it\u2019s going to house far more than that. You\u2019re on a slippery slope here, a literal slippery slope, by allowing a residential home that\u2019s always been a residential home in a residential community to become commercial.\u201d\n\nThe planning commission, however, was widely supportive of the idea of opening the expansive property for the public to enjoy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the opportunity this very unique, special property to become more publicly accessible,\u201d Commissioner Sheila O\u2019Neill said. \u201cI think you\u2019re offering an opportunity \u2013 you\u2019re remaining stewards of the property \u2013 but you\u2019re giving an opportunity to share in the uniqueness of this property.\u201d\n\nWith a permit, bed and breakfasts are free to operate in the neighborhood \u2014 which is zoned Sonoma Residential \u2014 according to Associate Planner Kristina Tierney. No official appeals against the planning commission\u2019s decision were filed in time, so it will not be heard by the city council.\n\n\u201cThe fact that someone has a business license is not equal to a commercialization of a neighborhood,\u201d commission Chair Larry Barnett said. \u201cPeople have professional occupations, they work out of their homes, and if anything, today, people are working more out of their home than ever.\u201d\n\nThe Sebastiani\u2019s new endeavor would be held to the city\u2019s ordinances on noise, pool use and the number of people allowed to stay on site at one time, according to city staff. Barnett \u2013 leaning on his own experience operating the Thistle Dew Inn as a bed and breakfast \u2013 expressed his concerns about pool use and alcohol service at the home.\n\nAny alcohol service would require a state license with specific guidelines on where and when drinks could be consumed. Barnett withdrew his permit application for a bed and breakfast due to the challenges of managing these regulations, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something else you\u2019re going to have to look at,\u201d Barnett said regarding the city, county and state restrictions that apply to operating a bed and breakfast.\n\nFor Coakley and her family, opening their beloved home to the public adds another chapter to the long legacy of the Sebastiani name in Sonoma Valley.\n\n\u201cAs (my parents) look towards the future and what that means for the next and fifth generation, they would like the flexibility and options this permit would provide them,\u201d Sebastiani said. \u201cI am excited to help figure that out and plan the next stage of their lives and our family\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nContact Chase Hunter at chase.hunter@sonomanews.com and follow @Chase_HunterB on Twitter."

        "title": "What is Venus Protocol? - A Guide to the BNB Lending Protocol - CoinCentral",
        "content": "Venus Protocol is a decentralized money market protocol for lending and borrowing cryptocurrencies. It provides low-cost, fast transactions and allows users to take out loans with fast issuance and no credit check.\n\nUnlike centralized lenders, such as BlockFi and Celsius \u2014who declared bankruptcy and froze user withdrawals in 2022\u2014users don\u2019t need to sign up with the typical CeFi log-in credentials; Venus Protocol users connect crypto wallets like MetaMask.\n\nThe following guide explores the Venus Protocol in-depth, but if you\u2019re looking for the best alternative centralized crypto lenders, check out these 5 crypto interest accounts that could fill the void left by Celsius.\n\nWhat is Venus Protocol?\n\nVenus is the second-largest lending protocol in the BNB Chain \u2014only topped by accounting for roughly 30% of the total market share in terms of total value locked (TVL).\n\nAs of December 2022, the protocol has lent over $450 million in assets, and its TVL has been floating north of $700 million since mid-2022.\n\nVenus Protocol\u2019s standout advertised features include:\n\nLending and borrowing loans in a matter of seconds\n\nStaking and earning rewards in crypto, up to 20%\n\nLiquidity pools offering up to 30% APY\n\nMint synthetic stablecoins\n\nParticipate in the community DAO\n\nDisclaimer: Cryptocurrency, and especially DeFi protocols like Venus Protocol are very risky. The following article is not and should not be considered a substitute for investment advice.\n\nHow Does Venus Protocol Work?\n\nVenus was built exclusively for the BNB Chain (formerly known as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC)), therefore its native currency, XVS, uses the BEP-20 standard.\n\nVenus supports multiple types of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins that can be used as collateral to borrow from the protocol\u2019s pools or earn rewards by becoming a liquidity provider.\n\nHow to Borrow on Venus Protocol\n\nLoans are over-collateralized, meaning users who wish to borrow must pledge collateral with a ratio depending on the current governance proposal, but they usually range from 50% to 70%. So, to hypothetically borrow $10,000, you\u2019d need to post $15,000 of collateral, for example.\n\nThis collateral is then locked in a Venus Protocol smart contract for a specified period.\n\nIn the Market section, choose an asset, and you\u2019ll be able to see the collateral factor (as well as market liquidity, number of suppliers and borrowers, APY, and more.)\n\nLending on Venus\n\nUsers can lend assets to Venus to earn yield, which varies on the type of asset.When a user loans cryptocurrencies to Venus, the funds are added to the lending pools. In exchange, depositors receive vTokens (for example, deposited BUSD becomes vBUSD).\n\nUsers can redeem these tokens for the underlying token.\n\nMinting Stablecoins\n\nUsers can mint VAI, a synthetic stablecoin fixed at 1 USD (price will still fluctuate depending on market demand). This asset can be used for yield farming on other DEXs in the BNB ecosystem. Users can mint VAI using up to 50% of the remaining collateral value from previous vToken deposits.\n\nThe interest rates of VAI have yet to be determined (they are known as stability fees in other lending protocols like MakerDAO), so it depends on Governance and what the new V4 upgrade will bring.\n\nVenus Protocol: History & Founders\n\nThe project was developed by Swipe, a cryptocurrency credit card issuer, officially launch in 2020. The team delegated control to the XVS community holders. Since then, multiple proposals have been submitted and put forward to change, upgrade and improve the Venus protocol.\n\nVenus was born as a fork of Compound (COMP), a popular crypto lender built on the Ethereum network, and also took some inspiration from MarkerDAO. The protocol is essentially a mix of the two systems and their respective benefits. It was also audited by blockchain security firm CertiK in December 2020.\n\nThe team didn\u2019t run a pre-mine for founders or the community. The only way to earn XVS was through the Binance LaunchPool project or by providing liquidity to the protocol during the early days.\n\nVenus V4 Release\n\nIn November 2022, the Venus DAO unveiled its V4 upgrade after months of discussions. The upgrade seeks to enhance the network in three key areas:\n\nRisk management. Isolated markets: introduce new tokens of all kinds but pooled into their respective, separate lending pools. This has two significant benefits: 1) it protects users and the ecosystem from disaster since they are essentially segregating assets with potential risk into isolated pools; 2) it allows users to pick which pools to participate depending on their appetite for risk.\n\n\n\nStable interest rate borrowing: a mechanism that will set stable interest rates for loans across all markets.\n\n\n\nBetter risk management mechanisms: will provide a mechanism that will provide shortfall coverage for users, and a stability fee to keep VAI pegged to USD. This is especially important, as in 2021, VAI lost is peg due to oversupply and experienced a massive market sell-off.\n\n\n\nDecentralization\n\nImproved governance system: new governance roles have been assigned, longer intervals for contract upgrades and role reassignments,\n\n\n\nPrice Feed Redundancy: allows Venus to support multiple blockchain oracles to avoid single points of failure.\n\nUser experience:\n\nPartnership with DEXs: Venus has partnered with multiple DEXs in the BNB ecosystem, including PancakeSwap, to allow users to freely move funds between multiple protocols without leaving Venus. This makes Venus a DEX in which borrowing, lending, and swaps across multiple DEXs happen in a single UI.\n\nNew tokenomics: Tokenomics 3.0: will bring new financial mechanisms to incentivize protocol retention. XVS becomes the core utility token, XVS emissions are cut, value is reinvested, and shortfall defense is added.\n\n\n\nThe protocol will introduce the Venus Prime Soulbound Token (SBT), which users can earn if they stake a minimum of 1,000 tokens for 90 days in the Venus vault. The benefits of SBT are that it provides users with exclusive access to better yield across different markets, and dividends can be paid out in the supplied currency.\n\n\n\nVenus Protocol: Tokenomics\n\nXVS is the protocol\u2019s utility token based on the BEP-20 token standard. XVS\u2019s main uses cases are:\n\nStaking\n\nVoting\n\nPay for transaction fees\n\nThe token has a max supply of 29 million tokens and a circulating supply of 12 million (or 41% of the total supply.)\n\nXVS & Venus Governance\n\nThe Venus community runs a simple governance system: delegated and direct on-chain voting, where 1 XVS token = 1 vote. Whenever a protocol proposal is submitted through a Venus Improvement Proposal (VIP (similar to Ethereum\u2019s EIP)), users can vote directly or delegate their voting rights to another user.\n\nProposals cost 300,000 XVS, which currently amounts to nearly $1 million. Once proposed, voting is active for three days. To be approved, the proposal must reach a voting quorum of 600,000 XVS. If successful, the proposal is timelocked for two days before implementation.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Future of Venus Protocol)\n\nVenus Protocol has a TVL of $710 million, currently boasting $1 billion in liquidity as per its website and has borrowed over $450 million since its relatively short time in the industry.\n\nDespite these numbers, Venus Protocol doesn\u2019t really attract the same attention as platforms like PancakeSwap. Still, the protocol has managed to thrive along with the DeFi ecosystem, and the V4 upgrade brings better tokenomics, more risk management tools such as isolated pools, and an improved governance system to solidify decentralization."
