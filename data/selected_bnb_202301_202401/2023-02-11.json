        "title": "OP Token Falls 13% After Surprise Optimism Network\u2019s Airdrop - Coin Culture",
        "content": "According to a blog post by layer 2 blockchain\u2019s organisation, Optimism Collective, Optimism Network launched a token airdrop on Thursday, releasing 11.7 million governance tokens to over 300,000 wallets.\n\nThe airdrop is a part of the blockchain\u2019s plan to distribute 19% of its initial governance token supply as it forges a road to greater acceptance. Optimism delivered 5% of its initial supply of governance tokens, or roughly 200 million tokens, in its first airdrop in May last year.\n\nThe airdrop occurs as Optimism attempts to gain an advantage over its most significant competitor, Arbitrum, a second Ethereum layer without a token. Abritrum presently has more than twice as many active wallets as Optimism, with the difference between the two exchanges\u2019 active wallets expanding over the previous month.\n\nUsers who spent gas on the blockchain to execute transactions qualified for the airdrop, as did those who delegated the voting abilities that governance tokens provide to other users. The Optimism Network acknowledges the distribution of voting privileges as a positive sum action to strengthen the governance system of the blockchain.\n\nThe token dropped 13% upon hearing the circulating supply of Optimism had increased. Despite this, OP has gained approximately 200% over the previous three weeks. The token trades for around $2.35 per unit at the time of publishing.\n\nUnlike Optimism\u2019s initial effort in July 2022, when customers were required to claim their allotments physically, Thursday\u2019s unexpected airdrop ran surprisingly well. In this instance, distribution occurred automatically."

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrencies To Invest In During A Bear Market - Parle Magazine",
        "content": "Please share and follow us:\n\nCrypto\u2019s bear market last year was brutal, especially for persons with monies in high-risk and high-growth projects. Thanks to the Russia-Ukraine war and drastic price increases in the United States, a supposed crypto winter endured all four seasons of 2022. Nonetheless, given the astounding expansion a lot of cryptocurrencies encountered over the past ten years, the assets keep investors involved and on their toes.\n\nIn spite of their sprees of fickleness, cryptocurrencies have had superb ROI\u2019s over the long term. For investors who build their portfolios for the long-term \u2014 and can handle the turbulent times \u2014 dedicating funds to these digital assets could pay off sooner than later. Investing in crypto isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, however, for those looking to wet their beak, here are three cryptocurrencies to invest in during a bear market.\n\nBitcoin\n\nWhen discussing cryptocurrencies to invest in during a bear market, you must commence with Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency and more so because it\u2019s the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. Presently, the digital asset\u2019s market cap is $443.7 billion. 21 million tokens is the max supply of Bitcoin that can ever exist, so it has a limited supply. The token is decentralized, which means no institution or government can influence or control it. Bitcoin is a borderless currency, thereby, it can be received and sent to any person around the globe. The token\u2019s network transactions are recorded on the blockchain (a public ledger) which furnishes security and transparency. Also, traditional financial transactions cost more than Bitcoin transactions. You\u2019re able to purchase cars, vacations, insurance, gift cards, jewelry, groceries and more with Bitcoin as well.\n\nEthereum\n\nBehind Bitcoin, the second-largest blockchain network in the world is Ethereum (ETH); it\u2019s market cap is $200.7 billion. Program developers are head over heels about Ethereum because of its prospective applications, such as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and smart contracts that execute mechanically when preset conditionals are met. The token has also endured substantial growth. Ethereum\u2019s price was $11 in April 2016 \u2014 fast forward to February 2023, and the token\u2019s price is roughly $1,670 \u2014 profit-maximizing 150 times over. Ethereum is undoubtedly one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in during a bear or bull market.\n\nBinance\n\nBinance (BNB) has a market cap of roughly $48.7 billion and is the fourth largest crypto in the world (behind Tether). Binance Coin launched in 2017, and since it has dilated past only enabling trades on BNB\u2018s exchange platform. These days, it can be utilized to process payments, barter, or even book hotels and flights. Binance Coin also be exchanged or traded for other types of tokens (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum). In 2017, you could buy BNB for merely $0.10. Now, in February 2023 you can purchase one BNB token for $309.\n\nReaders May Also Like:\n\nPatrick Mahomes & Other Black Quarterbacks Who\u2019ve Won The NFL\u2019s MVP\n\nSouth African Rapper AKA, Shot Dead in Durban Nightclub Shooting\n\nJa Rule Feels No Rap Artists \u2018Dead or Alive\u2019 Are Better Than Him\n\nTrump Disses Rihanna Ahead Of Super Bowl Halftime Performance"

        "content": "A bed and breakfast owner, best known for denying running a Japanese restaurant, is fighting to expand his property after City Hall rejected the plans. Orlando Williams, owner of the controversial Orlando\u2019s bed and breakfast, applied for a two-storey rear extension to his property but was rebuffed by Norwich City Council in early 2022.\n\nNow, Mr Williams is appealing to the government\u2019s Planning Inspectorate to get the decision overturned. Since 2019, the B&B owner has been involved in an extraordinary battle with Norwich City Council over whether he has been running an illegitimate restaurant from his property on Earlham Road. Something Mr Williams has previously denied despite people reporting being served meals at the premises.\n\nThe extension would provide space for two extra bedrooms as well as additional seating and dining space. The plans submitted to the council show an expanded dining room, as well as a separate breakfast area and two seating areas, as well as two extra bedrooms.\n\nGet more local news from NorfolkLive straight to your inbox for free HERE\n\nPlanning officials did not raise the property\u2019s restaurant use as a reason for their rejection of the application. However, it was mentioned in their supporting evidence in the appeal as part of the information present to inspectors.\n\nThe planning officer\u2019s 2022 rejection said: \u201cIt is considered that this increased occupancy and intensity of use internally and externally would be out of character in this suburban residential area and the resulting noise, disturbance and activity would be unacceptably harmful to the amenity of adjoining occupiers.\u201d\n\n(Image: LDR)\n\nBut Mr Williams and his architect are arguing to inspectors that City Hall has treated the application \u201cunjustly\u201d, with surrounding buildings having a similar design. They also argue that there are other B&Bs in the area, the site with the next door property was given approval in 2015 to be turned into a much larger guesthouse and the increase in guests would not cause harm to the area.\n\n\u201cThe proposed scheme was not for a grand or overstated extension as previously demonstrated, but a modest addition with the sole purpose of increasing accommodation to provide a local service and further income to the appellant due to rising running costs and the ongoing cost of living crisis,\u201d they said.\n\nMr Williams declined to comment. While Mr Williams has previously denied operating an eatery from the premises \u2013 which is adorned with signage for \u2018Orlando\u2019s\u2019 \u2013 diners have reported eating there, prompting the council to launch an inquiry. The council closed an investigation in 2020 saying there was no \u201cdefinitive evidence\u201d of a restaurant being run at the site.\n\nBut Mr Williams has repeatedly shared posts on his Facebook page saying he was opening a \u201csushi and Japanese restaurant\u201d at the Earlham Road site, most recently on January 29, 2023. Last year the council said it will not take any further action unless the business is \u201ccausing harm\u201d.\n\nMr Williams\u2019 bed and breakfast has all the necessary planning permissions. But under the terms of its operation, the business cannot serve food to people who are not staying at the premises. Non-guests have previously reported eating at the site.\n\nRead next:"
