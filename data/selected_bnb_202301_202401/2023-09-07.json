        "content": "RUNE, the native utility token of the THORChain decentralized liquidity protocol, has emerged as the top gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, while Binance partially suspended the asset\u2019s withdrawals.\n\nRUNE gained 7.6% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $1.61 at the time of writing. The rise comes while the asset\u2019s 24-hour trading volume registered almost 50% incline, currently at $50 million.\n\nRUNE price, social volume and positive sentiment \u2013 Sep. 7 | Source: Santiment\n\nMoreover, RUNE\u2019s market cap rose to $546 million, making it the 61st largest crypto asset.\n\nYou might also like: Binance will reportedly delist Monero and privacy coins in Belgium\n\nThe price hike comes while the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, suspended RUNE withdrawals on its BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2). The exchange noted that the suspension comes due to high wallet congestion.\n\nHowever, RUNE\u2019s withdrawals on THORChain and the asset\u2019s deposits on both networks seem to be fully operational, per Binance\u2019s data.\n\nFurthermore, data provided by the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that the positive sentiment around THORChain has been constantly fading over the past week. Per the data, RUNE\u2019s optimistic sensation plunged by around 95% since Sep. 2.\n\nWhile THORChain registered 72% gains over the past 30 days, its social volume has constantly been declining, with a few gains since Aug. 15, according to Santiment.\n\nPer the market intelligence platform, RUNE\u2019s social volume dropped by 90% over the past week.\n\nThis is not the first time that THORChain has faced network issues. The decentralized liquidity protocol halted its operations due to a security flaw in the network in late March. Per a report on March 28, the suspension was made to prevent any potential threats."

These addresses either received funds directly from Stake\u2019s hot wallets or were used to siphon illicit gains through various networks.\n\nSecurity shops Arkham and CertiK both said the hacker bridged funds to Avalanche and then to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. At press time, the culprits held $36 million on Ethereum , BNB Chain, and Polygon.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the Hacker has been gradually bridging funds to the BTC Blockchain using a series of new wallets on Polygon and Avalanche.\n\n\n\nThey have so far bridged $4.5M to BTC addresses, with the remaining $36M still held on ETH/BNB/Polygon. pic.twitter.com/fiMy62ABwL \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) September 7, 2023\n\nLazarus Group, also known as APT38, is a band of cyber criminals and hackers supposedly funded by the North Korean government.

The OFAC claimed that Lazarus tapped Tornado Cash to launder hundreds of millions in illicit wealth."
