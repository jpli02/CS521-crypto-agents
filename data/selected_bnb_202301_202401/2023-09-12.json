        "title": "Binance to Airdrop $3 Million BNB to Aid Morocco Earthquake Victims - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "In light of the recent earthquake that struck the Marrakesh-Safi Province of Morocco, Binance Charity has pledged to airdrop up to $3 million in BNB to affected Binance users in the region.\n\nThe criteria for the airdrop are based on Proof of Address (POA) submissions. Users who had completed their POA by 9 September 2023 in the hardest-hit Marrakesh-Safi Province will be eligible for a $100 BNB airdrop directly to their Binance accounts. Recognizing that some users might not have completed their POA by the aforementioned date, Binance has extended a grace period. Users who complete their POA between 9 September and 30 September 2023 will receive a $25 BNB donation.\n\nAdditionally, Binance will airdrop $10 in BNB to active transacting users throughout Morocco, even if they reside outside the most affected areas. The initiative is expected to benefit approximately 70,000 Binance users in Morocco, with the funds distribution commencing on 12th September 2023.\n\nNatural disasters often disrupt traditional banking systems, leaving victims without access to crucial funds. Cryptocurrency, with its swift, cost-effective, and transparent transactions, is emerging as a viable alternative for delivering financial aid in such circumstances.\n\nCommenting on the situation, Binance's founder and CEO, CZ, stated, \u201cThe impact of the earthquake on the Moroccan people is devastating. We hope we can bring some support to those affected. For Moroccan users who receive these donations but are unimpacted by the earthquake, we ask them to pass the funds on to those most in need.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the airdrop, Binance Charity has set up a public donation address, allowing anyone to contribute. All donations received will be forwarded in their entirety to a yet-to-be-named authorized NGO. Accepted cryptocurrencies for this cause include BNB, BTC, ETH, USDC , USDT, and BUSD.\n\nIn these challenging times, Binance reaffirms its commitment to its Moroccan user base, seeking further avenues to assist the community.\n\nAbout BNB\n\nBNB, the native token of Binance, represents a cornerstone of the Binance ecosystem. Launched in July 2017, Binance has since become the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume. Beyond its primary function as an exchange, Binance has expanded its reach, introducing various sub-projects like the Binance Chain, Binance Smart Chain, and Binance Academy. BNB plays a pivotal role in these projects. Founded by Changpeng Zhao and co-founder He Yi, Binance's vision is to be the infrastructure services provider for the entire blockchain ecosystem. Unique features of BNB include its deflationary tokenomics, enhanced by measures like BEP-95, and its coin burn mechanism, aiming to reduce its initial supply by half. The initial circulation of BNB was 200 million tokens.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock\n\n. . .\n\nTags"

This group, believed to be financed by the North Korean government, has allegedly been responsible for pilfering over $1 billion in virtual currencies since 2022.\n\nAuthorities have linked the Lazarus Group to several other major cryptocurrency thefts, including a $100 million breach at Atomic Wallet, a similar amount at Harmony\u2019s Horizon bridge, and a staggering $600 million from Sky Mavis\u2019 Ronin bridge, marking one of the largest breaches in the cryptocurrency sector to date.\n\nFurthermore, the group is accused of stealing $97 million from cryptocurrency payment processors Alphapo and CoinsPaid.\n\nIn a related development, the US Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on the privacy tool Tornado Cash in August 2022, citing suspected connections with the Lazarus Group.\n\nThe OFAC alleges that the group used Tornado Cash to launder numerous ill-gotten gains, running into hundreds of millions."

According to a report by Finance Magnates, the deregistration comes as a result of the company's prolonged inactivity in offering services under the Cypriot crypto license for more than six consecutive months.\n\nIn June, Binance initiated the process of deregistering its local subsidiary in Cyprus. Despite holding the necessary license, the company did not provide any clear explanation for maintaining a dormant presence in the Cypriot crypto market. Binance secured a Class 3 registration as a CASP from CySEC in October last year.\n\nBesides that, Binance.US, the US arm of the global crypto exchange, has responded strongly to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an ongoing legal dispute. The exchange's legal team filed sealed documents today (Tuesday), deeming many of the regulator's demands \"unreasonable\" and \"unduly burdensome.\""
