        "title": "Sister Wives: Kody & Robyn Are Now Living With Meri In Her Utah BNB \u2014 Spotted Moving Stuff Into The Heritage Inn! - TV Season Spoilers",
        "content": "After the most recent season of TLC\u2019s Sister Wives, the storyline of the Brown fam has changed entirely. One by one, three of Kody Brown\u2019s spouses decided to quit the plural family. So, the infamous polygamist is practically living a monogamous life with Robyn now. Well, Christine and Janelle were the ones that voluntarily ended their marriages. However, it was Kody\u2019s decision to leave Meri, and it\u2019s likely that she is still in love with him. Unlike the rest of his exes, she is still hanging out with him and his favorite wife, Robyn. Shockingly, it seems like Kody and Robyn have now moved into Meri\u2019s BnB situated in Parowan, Utah.\n\nSister Wives: Kody & Robyn Spotted Filming The Next Season At Meri\u2019s BnB! Moving In With Her?\n\nDespite all the warnings by fans, Meri Brown might be hung up on her ex even today. Her marriage with Kody was unofficially over years ago, but she was not ready to accept it. Hence, it was he who made the decision of ending things with his first wife. Sister Wives fans have noticed many of her cryptic social media posts, which suggest that it\u2019s been hard for Meri to move on. And unlike Christine and Janelle, she is still hanging out with Kody. In fact, as per an onlooker, the celebrity polygamist and his only remaining wife have moved into Meri\u2019s Heritage Inn situated in Utah. A Reddit thread revealed that Kody and Robyn were spotted shifting into the BnB.\n\nSOURCE: REDDIT\n\nThe Redditor revealed that they saw the Brown family patriarch at Lizzie\u2019s Heritage Inn along with the show\u2019s crew members. There was a huge moving truck standing at the location, and the onlooker even saw Robyn bringing in a piano. Now, fans wonder if Meri Brown is think ing of selling off her mother\u2019s BnB\n\nSister Wives: Why Were Kody & Robyn At Meri\u2019s Heritage Inn?\n\n. If that\u2019s the case, it could be Kody and Robyn that are taking over the property. While this detail has not been verified, fans are furious that Meri is letting her ex back into her life. People are asking her to stop catering to him and his favored wife. Others believe that the three of them could be doing so to keep the TLC checks coming.\n\nAs per what the current storyline of Sister Wives looks like, fans were assuming that Kody and Robyn were secluded from the rest of the family. And Meri, Christine, and Janelle seemed to be living their independent lives. However, with this new update, fans wonder how the story will take shape in the next season. Discussions on Reddit have given various reasons why Kody and Robyn were spotted at Lizzie\u2019s Heritage Inn. One of them was related to Meri selling her mother\u2019s property. Another fan suggested that the couple could be returning Meri\u2019s stuff back to her. After all, the latter\u2019s rental house in Flagstaff was sold off a while ago.\n\nTLC: ROBYN, MERI & KODY\n\nOther reasons that have come up include Kody and Robyn being in financial ruin. So, they might not be able to afford the house they were living in after paying off their debts. This would also mean that the entire family has given up on Coyote Pass now. And they are all living in Utah now as it was only Kody, Robyn, and their kids that were left in Flagstaff. What do you think about this situation? Tell us in the comments below. Also, stay tuned to TV Season & Spoilers for all exciting Sister Wives updates."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have become popular in the cryptocurrency markets due to their meme-based appeal, with users hoping that prices will increase as more people discover them. However, these tokens are not designed for any purpose beyond trading and speculation, limiting their utility.\n\nIn contrast, HedgeUp (HDUP) is a Utility Token explicitly built for use with the HedgeUp (HDUP) platform. This platform provides users with access to alternative assets. Whether it be art, gold, antiques, or whiskey, users can easily access these alternative options using the HedgeUp (HDUP) utility token.\n\nLet\u2019s explore why these two meme coins can\u2019t compete in terms of ROI, starting with Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nDespite its cute appearance, Dogecoin (DOGE) is more of a speculative asset than a useful utility token. Speculative assets offer high risk and potentially high rewards, but the rewards are unpredictable and not guaranteed, and this is what we see with Dogecoin (DOGE). At best, Dogecoin (DOGE) can be thought of as an online tipping system for users to reward one another with small amounts of cryptocurrency.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) has a strong community but is starting to fizzle out. Dogecoin (DOGE) will struggle to compete with cryptos with an actual utility, such as HedgeUp (HDUP), which does not have the speculative value of Dogecoin (DOGE). Rather, HedgeUp (HDUP) offers a secure, low-cost platform for users to access alternative assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, Dogecoin (DOGE) should consider reallocating resources to create a unique, more attractive offering than just the meme-based appeal.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is another meme coin that has gained popularity due to its humorous appearance and tongue-in-cheek branding. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also just a joke. Shiba Inu (SHIB) doesn\u2019t do anything useful and is primarily used for speculation.\n\nThere are no real-world applications for Shiba Inu (SHIB). It can be considered a meme currency, which is not very attractive to users looking for a token with long-term utility.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) may be developing some fun dApps but nothing different or game-changing. Hype for Shiba Inu (SHIB) had died down since its initial surge when it was introduced to the market, making it a risky asset. Compared to HedgeUp (HDUP), Shiba Inu (SHIB) has nothing to offer in terms of utility or ROI.\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP)\n\nNot only do HedgeUp (HDUP) users benefit from owning the utility token for their interest in alternative assets, but just being a part of the underlying ecosystem also means they can benefit from the growth of HedgeUp (HDUP). This is because as more and more people use the platform later on, early adopters could be rewarded with their initial presale acquisition.\n\nThe team is so committed to its mission that they offer a 30% bonus.

        "content": "RARE BNB I built an Airbnb in just 10 days \u2013 now there\u2019s almost a one-year waiting list\n\nTHE couple behind one of the UK's most booked Airbnbs say it took only took ten days to construct.\n\nArchitect Roderick James, 75, and his interior designer wife Amanda Markham, designed and built the AirShip 002 in 2018.\n\n11 The Airbnb took just ten days to build but now you have to wait almost a year to stay there Credit: SWNS\n\n11 The AirShip offers amazing views across Drimnin in Scotland Credit: SWNS\n\n11 It has an outdoor section for visitors to sit and admire the view across the water Credit: SWNS\n\nThe \"remote, cosy, compact, aluminium clad capsule structure\" has been compared to a \"futuristic air ship\" and offers breath-taking Highland views from floor to ceiling.\n\nThe \u00a3165 a night accommodation in Drimnin, Scotland, was the most wish-listed Airbnb rental in the UK in 2020 and secures bookings over a year in advance.\n\nThe project built as part of their company Out of the Blue Ltd cost \u00a3100k, but it has already made its money back since creation five years ago.\n\nThe couple live nearby in another house they designed themselves called Eagle Rock.\n\nRoderick said: \"We designed the AirShip 002 just for fun at first, but then a perfect plot came up and we decided to build on it.\n\n\"At first we weren't intending to let it. We just thought it would be an ideal location but then it became incredibly popular.\n\n\"It was a brand new design and it had never been done before. We wanted to build something that could be built anywhere and any part of the structure can be carried by two people.\n\n\"It has over 3000 components which were computer laser cut in the factory which took three to four months.\n\n\"But then the actual structure went up in ten days on site. In future all housing will become increasingly modular.\n\n\"The structure has everything you could need. It can even be off-grid with a compost toilet and rainwater can be collected from the roof and stored under the floor panels.\n\n\"The dragonfly window breaks up the view in such an extraordinary way. Everyone who stays here wishes they could stay for longer. It really is a special place.\"\n\nGetting a room in the AirShip is easier said than done, with nothing available until the winter.\n\n11 Previous guests have said staying at the AirShip made them feel special Credit: SWNS\n\n11 A night in the AirShip is available from \u00a3165 per night Credit: SWNS\n\n11 Some bookings have already been made for next July and August Credit: SWNS\n\nAnyone wanting to stay there next summer should move fast as well, with some dates in June, July and August already booked up.\n\nit has an overall score of 4.95/5 from more than 340 reviews, with guests amazed by what the accommodation has to offer.\n\nOne reviewer wrote: \"The Airship has the wow factor.\n\n\"We will return again soon to this secret little gem of a place.\"\n\n11 The Pilot House PH5 is another of Roderick and Amanda's properties Credit: SWNS\n\n11 The aluminium structure was built in just six months and offers 360 degree views Credit: SWNS\n\nAnother said: \"Just a lovely place to stay, we felt so special staying there.\"\n\nFollowing the success of the AirShip, the couple have embarked on two other tiny house projects to rent on Airbnb.\n\nThe Pilot House PH5, an aluminium structure with 360 degree views, was completed after just six months of building in September 2020.\n\nThis was followed by the creation of The Captain's Cabin in January 2021. This stay even comes with the gift of a novel titled 'The Captains Cabin' by Alexander McCall Smith.\n\n11 The Highland valley in Drimnin, Scotland where the AirShip can be found Credit: SWNS\n\n11 Architect Roderick and his wife, interior designer Amanda, who built the property Credit: SWNS\n\nAll profits from the book, published by Roderick and Amanda's company Out of The Blue, go directly to the \"transformational\" charity Jamie's Farm which hosts disadvantaged children for residential farm stays.\n\nThe PilotHouse and the Captains Cabin each display unique, intriguing features.\n\nThe PilotHouse PH5 is a one bed, two storey aluminium structure with a spiral staircase. It has an unusual corrugated aluminium wall finish, and its sheet aluminium exterior walls have a resonance of a submarine 'Conning Tower'.\n\nThe latest and smallest project, the Captain's Cabin, sits on the large balcony deck on the roof of an old chapel building on the same site as the other projects and is also proving very popular.\n\nWhilst the exterior is similarly clad in corrugated aluminium, the interior is more textural and cosy with re-used timber and a nautical theme featuring artefacts from the book.\n\nAll of their quirky builds feature stunning views and fresh spring water, but their unique shape is what Roderick attributes some of their success to.\n\nHe said: \"One of the key things we work on, even in our own house, is that they're all based on elliptical, oval, shapes.\n\n\"We have discovered that people feel very comfortable in these plan shapes. Sandi Toksvig described it as 'like a womb with a view!' There are no sharp corners and as a result people feel very secure.\n\n\"The views add an enormous amount too. If you have a very small space, but a big view, it works very well.\"\n\nYou can book a stay at the AirShip here.\n\nMeanwhile, a major rule change could make things difficult for Airbnb guests.\n\nAnd this couple took revenge on their Airbnb host over a petty row about the accommodation."
