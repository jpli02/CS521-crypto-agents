        "content": "APT\n\nDelegated staking allows users to delegate their staking power to a trusted validator and earn rewards without becoming a validator themselves.\n\nAptos Enables Token Holders to Secure the Network\n\nThe Aptos Foundation released Core Delegation Pool functionality through Aptos Implementation Proposal 6 (AIP-6), developed by Bware Labs. Aptos made this recent announcement on April 20 through a Twitter post.\n\nThe delegation pool extends Aptos' existing staking protocol. Its main purpose is to enable multiple parties to contribute to the staking requirement by entrusting the stake to a trusted validator.\n\nOnce the delegation pool reaches the minimum stake required to run a validator, the validator can enter the active set and start validating blocks. The number of validators participating in the network determines the security and decentralization of L1 protocols. The greater the number of validators, the more decentralized the blockchain becomes.\n\nFor Aptos, this further decentralizes the network by achieving two goals:\n\nBy delegating their staking power to a validator, token holders can support the security of the network and earn rewards without having to run a validator themselves. To reach the minimum stake required to join the validator set, node operators can spin up a delegation pool and have the public stake in it. As a result, the community can bootstrap validator nodes more quickly.\n\nPrior to Aptos Implementation Proposal 6 (AIP-6), only token holders with more than 1M $APT could stake tokens and earn rewards. The AIP-6 also allows multiple wallets to contribute to the stake required for a validator to enter the active set.\n\nThus, delegated staking offers everyone increased access, flexibility, and self-custody. By delegating staking, token holders keep ownership of their $APT in their wallets without relying on off-chain methods to aggregate funds.\n\nAptos ($APT) has a total volume locked (TVL) at $61.33 million. $APT is trading at $10.98, down 3.67% in 24 hours.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat is Aptos:\n\nAptos is a new, independent project focused on delivering the safest and most production-ready Layer 1 blockchain in the world. The team includes the original creators, researchers, designers, and builders of Diem, the blockchain first built to serve this purpose.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhere to find Aptos Labs:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram | Medium | Discord |"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nPink Moon Studios introduced the eagerly awaited free-to-play mode for its renowned strategic game KMON Genesis.\n\nFormerly known as Kryptomon, KMON Genesis was rebranded to lower the barrier of entry to one of the most popular Web3 games in the market. The game allows gamers to collect, breed and trade unique creatures in the KMON universe. These creatures are called Kyptomons, digital collectible pets built on the BSC blockchain. Players act as trainers for these digital pets. Trainers are responsible for breeding and training their pets to create new Kryptomons.\n\nEach Kryptomon has a unique genetic code comprising 38 different and randomized parameters. The parameters determine other traits of the pets, from visual appearance to prowess in combat. Like a natural pet, Kryptomons require attention, and failure to provide this will make them \u201cfreeze\u201d (simulated death). In the unfortunate event a pet gets frozen, trainers can unfreeze them (simulated revival) using special items available on Pink Moon\u2019s marketplace, which can be bought using KMON tokens, the native tokens on the platform.\n\nTrainers can also train their pets to prepare them for battle against others in the gameplay. Notably, Pink Moon Studios shares revenue from KMON Genesis with players weekly. This is done through monetary rewards of an average of $50 in tokens when a player completes in-game challenges.\n\nCommenting on the development, Umberto Canessa Cerchi, Founder & CEO of Pink Moon Studios, stated:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur core mission has always been to make the enthralling KMON Genesis universe accessible to everyone. The introduction of the free-to-play mode is a game-changer, inviting players from all backgrounds to experience the innovative and exciting world we\u2019ve developed without any financial barriers or web3-related technological hurdles.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2021, the Pink Moon Studio was created by a group of experienced gamers and industry veterans who came together to bridge Web2 and Web3 games for a more enhanced player experience. The team behind the project has incorporated the Guild Affiliation Program to sustain the gaming guild while offering access to exciting games and allowing players to earn financial rewards. In addition, their gaming space has a Diamond contract solution that keeps gameplay fresh and exciting for users. Other features include on-chain AI, NFT forgoing, phygital items, and AR NFT Hunt.\n\nChief Product Officer and SVP of Game Development at Pink Moon Studios, Brian Bento, added:\n\n\u201cWe are eager to offer players a sneak peek into the mesmerizing digital realm of the World of Kogaea. Our dedicated team has poured countless hours into crafting a visually spectacular and engaging experience that players will find truly captivating.\u201d"
