        "content": "The Hoarders House That Became A Luxurious Bed & Breakfast\n\nIt's not a typical reaction to any given episode of \"Hoarders\" to want to visit the homes featured on the show, nor would any of those homes seem like prime candidates for conversion into a bed and breakfast. But as unlikely as it might seem, one such home did indeed undergo that transformation, and it was notable enough to be reported in the New York Post.\n\nThe home in question is the Julian Price House, also known as Hillside, which was purchased by an interior decorator named Sandra Cowart back in 1975. At some point, Cowart succumbed to a latent tendency towards hoarding, eventually leading to the large Greensboro, North Carolina, estate being featured on Season 9, Episode 6 of \"Hoarders\" after the house was foreclosed on and its new owners attempted to clean it out and bring it back to some of its former majesty. While it isn't the most disturbing episode of \"Hoarders\" by any stretch, it is among the more memorable ones. However, the estate's reality TV fame eventually led to a third life as a successful bed and breakfast where you can book your own luxurious stay on the official Julian Price House site.\n\nThe episode shows Hillside's buyers in the tricky position of having to evict Cowart, who experienced a sad decline into hoarding over the course of her 40+ years of ownership of the property. But it has a somewhat happy ending, with Cowart working with the buyers to help clear the home and leaving on somewhat positive terms."

        "content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making headlines for its struggles with high network patronage while Binance Coin (BNB) continues to grapple with its SEC lawsuit. At the same time, Borroe ($ROE), whose current trajectory is 25% up, has become one of the best defi projects on the market. Naturally, some investors are dumping Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Binance Coin (BNB) for Borroe ($ROE), but others question if it will really be a good crypto to buy now. Let\u2019s see who might be right regarding Borroe ($ROE).\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) Base Network, \u201cShibarium\u201d Resumes Block Production After High Traffic Concerns\n\nThe Shibarium network that powers the Shiba Inu (SHIB) memecoin has struggled with unusual network activity increase in the past few days. Since Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) token burn on July 11, Shibarium\u2019s network activity has been increasing.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) paused all block production on August 17 as Shibarium\u2019s network activity reached unusually high activity levels. The network activity increase raised concerns about fund security, so Shibarium entered a failsafe mode aimed at protecting Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) user funds.\n\nSHIB\u2019s decline is partly due to the market-wide drop-off on August 17. Once the crypto market turns bullish, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could potentially rise by 14.4% to $0.000009505.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) Suffers in the Aftermath of Battle with the SEC\n\nBinance Coin\u2019s (BNB) crypto exchange has been locked in a legal tussle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since June 5, 2023.\n\nThe SEC had sued Binance for several regulatory breaches, including selling unregistered securities, misrepresenting trading controls, and operating unregistered exchanges. The battle led to the delisting of several crypto trading pairs in Binance\u2019s US subsidiary.\n\nConsequently, the legal tussles have led to a sharp drop in Binance Coin\u2019s (BNB) value. Binance Coin\u2019s (BNB) trading activity also declined in some regions as the SEC\u2019s lawsuit raised credibility issues for Binance.\n\nThen the crypto market crashed on August 17, causing Binance Coin (BNB) to fall further.\n\nYet, experts say Binance Coin (BNB) could rise by 38.5% to $300.51 if the regulatory issues around it clear up, leading to a rise in Binance Coin\u2019s (BNB) trading activity.\n\nBorroe ($ROE): A Solution Designed for the Future of Internet Businesses\n\nThe growth of the Internet has been very rapid since the early 2000s. It got boosted further with the creation of Web 3 technologies and cryptocurrencies. Many internet businesses need to work at lightning speed to ensure quality service delivery.\n\nBorroe ($ROE) is a decentralized platform designed to improve the business efficiency of the Web 3.0 industry by providing secure, timely loans that are used to ensure the smooth running of business operations.\n\nBorroe ($ROE) takes a new and radically different approach to revenue financing. It aims to cut out numerous bottlenecks like lengthy delays and limited access. Borroe ($ROE) ensures the wider availability of loans by creating a secure marketplace that attracts interested firms and individuals willing to invest in revenue financing.\n\nBorroe\u2019s ($ROE) users will enjoy priority notifications on new offers, discounts, and special recognition for individual contributions to the platform.\n\nCurrently, Borroe\u2019s ($ROE) presale is one of the most popular topics in the crypto industry, making it one of the top ICOs. $ROE surged 25% as it moved from its Beta Stage price of $0.010 to Stage 1 of its presale, now trading at $0.0125.\n\nMany investors are willing to see what\u2019s next for Borroe ($ROE) as it is expected to reach $0.015 once it enters Stage 2 of its presale and $0.040 by the end of the public presale!\n\nLearn more about Borroe ($ROE) here:\n\nVisit Borroe Presale|Join The Telegram Group |Follow Borroe on Twitter"
