        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSince its February 23rd launch on the decentralized exchange Uniswap and subsequent April 7th listing on CoinMarketCap, the SWITCH Token has been very active.\n\nSWITCH made its Uniswap debut in February at $0.0035; it has since reached highs of $0.015 and is currently trading at about a penny with a daily average trading volume of more than $200,000.\n\nA well-known Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized cryptocurrency exchange is called Uniswap. A peer-to-peer exchange called Uniswap employs smart contracts to make trading possible. The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency price tracking website, CoinMarketCap, offers prices, charts, and data on listed currencies.\n\nOn websites like Twitter, Discord, and Reddit, the Switch Blockchain community keeps expanding. The Etherscan block explorer confirms that the SWITCH ERC-20 token was stored in more than 1300 different wallets as of this writing.\n\nThe Switch Blockchain generates the SWITCH Token as a digital incentive for node owners that own and host node licenses that run the blockchain, unlike some tokens that are produced through ICOs or Initial Coin Offerings. The Charter that node owners voted for and approved governs the Switch Blockchain. The Native Switch Blockchain has been bridged to the Ethereum Network, converting the SWITCH Token into an ERC-20 token. SWITCH will have a maximum supply of 50 billion tokens, according to its Litepaper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVisit www.switchrewardcard.com to learn more about Switch Reward Card (the firm), Switch Nodes, and the rest of their blockchain-based financial ecosystem, which includes the Switch Trading Platform and the Switch Card product."

        "content": "BNB\n\nBaby Doge Swap surpassed $83 million in TVL, approaching its all-time high.\n\nBig Year for Baby Doge\n\nBNB Chain MemeFi project Baby Doge Coin announced that its BabyDoge token is getting listed on KuCoin, its largest Centralized Exchange to date and a top 5 exchange overall.\n\nLast Friday, Baby Doge proclaimed that a top 5 CEX listing was coming soon, and sure enough the KuCoin announcement fulfilled that promise.\n\n$BabyDoge deposits are now open on KuCoin on both BNB Chain and Ethereum. Trading begins at 10 a.m. UTC on April 18.\n\nThe KuCoin listing exposes $BabyDoge to more than 27 million users. Currently, the token has more than 1.7 million holders on BNB Chain and nearly 11,000 on Ethereum.\n\nThe naming of KuCoin immediately appeared to be a \u201csell the news\u201d event, as $BabyDoge dipped by several percentage points after the announcement. However, since Friday the value of $BabyDoge is up by more than 30%.\n\nThe KuCoin listing is the latest positive indicator for $BabyDoge, which is on a tear in 2023, with the value of the token multiplying by nearly four times since Jan. 1.\n\nAs BSC News previously reported, Baby Doge has grown into much more than a dog coin and now has an array of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) offerings, anchored by its Baby Doge Swap Decentralized Exchange (DEX) which recently surpassed $83 million in Total Value Locked, according to DefiLlama, and appears on track to break its all-time high.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat is Baby Doge Swap:\n\nBaby Doge Swap is the acclaimed \u201cson\u201d of the popular meme token, DOGE. Baby Doge Swap started out as Baby Doge Coin and is a hyper-deflationary system that progressively increases its scarcity and increases its liquidity. The project is now a fully Decentralized Exchange with swaps, liquidity pools, yield farming, and more. Baby Doge considers its primary utility as building a fun meme community to spread awareness of animal adoption.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhere to find Baby Doge Swap:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram | Reddit | Swap |"

        "title": "Binance Coin Price Analysis & Prediction (April 17th) \u2013 BNB Resumes Bullish After Corrections, Gains 6% This Week ... - The VR Soldier",
        "content": "Binance Coin continues to trade inside a channel with a higher high and higher low pattern. It rebounded off a critical level in the past week and started to show signs of strength again. The price is up by a daily 10%.\n\nAfter marking a multi-high at $346 in late March, BNB went through a correctional phase and slowly fell to a key low level of $300 earlier this month. It found support there and recovered quickly with a long wick.\n\nThe price consolidated above $310 for days before it started to pick up this week. The price surged to a high of $333 on Tuesday but later retraced due to a sudden rejection. It found a solid rebound level at $315 and initiated another buy.\n\nToday, it reclaimed the previous high and pushed to $335 a few hours ago. A continuous surge in volatility could bring the price to the test of the channel\u2019s upper boundary by the end of the month. However, the price needs to break through last month\u2019s resistance.\n\nIn the case of a downward swing, BNB will have to decline below this week\u2019s support level and especially last week\u2019s before we can start to consider a drawdown.\n\nEven though the price collapses further, the channel\u2019s lower boundary could provide support. The crypto asset must break below this ascending channel to validate a downtrend. BNB is technically bullish on the higher time frame.\n\nBNB Key Level To Watch\n\nAs the price nears the $337.5 resistance level, the subsequent level to watch for a breakup lies at March\u2019s resistance of $346.4. From there, we can expect a quick rally to $361 and potentially $380 in the coming weeks.\n\nIf BNB retraces, the closest level to consider as support is $327.8 and $318.4. There\u2019s minor support at $310 before dipping to the monthly low of $300.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $337.5, $346.4, $361\n\nKey Support Levels: $318.4, $327.8, $300\n\nSpot Price: $332\n\nTrend: Bullish\n\nVolatility: Moderate\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any projects.\n\nImage Source: igorigorevich/123RF // Image Effects by Colorcinch"

The BNB Chain, that currently plays host to a plethora of decentralised apps (dApps), has updated its 'Red Alarm' list with the names of 191 dApps that may pose financial risks to users. These flagged dApps include Cineru, Sezams, Shorter Finance, The Bandit Project, The Cake Monster, and OnlyBrain. BNB Chain's list of potentially risky dApps also reflects the reason why they have caught its attention and the reasons range from their Twitter handles being dormant to a lack of a functional website.\n\n\u201cOften, these risky dApps' contracts don't align with their advertised functions, putting users at risk of losing funds,\u201d the BNB Chain posted on its official blog page. Many of the dApps listed on the Red Alarm index have raised suspicions about offering fake tokens or high tax fees, raising the number of ways unsuspecting investors could lose their hard-earned funds.\n\nSome dApps like Piston Token, CycGo, and Shorter Finance made it to the list due to their association with crypto mixer Tornado Cash, that is facing heavy scrutiny in the US for helping cybercriminals distribute illegal tokens to anonymous wallets. As per the analysis conducted by the BNB Chain, these apps are suspected to be funded by assets emerging out of Tornado Cash, a CoinTelegraph report states.\n\nRiding on the success of ChatGPT, scammers have also launched a bunch of dApps sounding like ChatGPT to take advantage of crypto investors.
