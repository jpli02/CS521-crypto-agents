        "title": "Binance Coin Price Analysis & Prediction (Feb 16th) \u2013 BNB Attempts $300 But Fails to Reclaim it, More Drops Ahead? - NullTX",
        "content": "Binance Coin finally underwent a correction after experiencing a consistent rally for eight weeks. The price plunged to January 18 low and sharply bounced off. Right now, it looks calm and prepared for another surge.\n\nA week ago, BNB lost a key support level and further fell through the $300 psychological level after printing a two-month high at $337.5 on its native exchange.\n\nAfter the price fell to $283 on Monday, BNB recovered a little and has remained indecisive. However, it attempted to reclaim the above psychological level yesterday but witnessed a rejection there. The price will continue to fall if Bitcoin plummets below the holding of $22k.\n\nMeanwhile, it has been trading inside an ascending channel since June 2022. This pattern looks like a bear flag on the weekly chart. Should the price collapse beneath this channel, BNB is expected to trade significantly below the $180 mark.\n\nA head and shoulder pattern could be in play on the daily chart. If the asset manages to buy back above the $260 level to form a right shoulder, we should expect a quick recovery back to the recent high before breaking higher.\n\nBNB is currently bearish. It has shed about 12% loss in the past week, with a market cap of $47 billion at press time.\n\nBNB Key Level To Watch\n\nIf the expected H&S pattern comes into play, the current holding level to watch is the $300 mark, followed by the $318.4 resistance level.\n\nThere is also resistance at $320, the lost support level during last week\u2019s surge in volatility. A break above the two-month high will trigger a massive buy to $360 in no time.\n\nIn continuation of this decline, it would need to lose the Monday low before looking for another support level at $270. The $261 level is the following support to pay attention to for more crackdowns. BNB\u2019s oversold level lies at $248.5.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $300, $318.4, $337.5\n\nKey Support Levels: $283, $270, $261\n\nSpot Price: $296\n\nTrend: Bearish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "title": "Trading pros suggest switching PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Binance (BNB) for Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) - Cyprus Mail",
        "content": "Trading pros have now suggested that investors consider switching from popular projects, such as PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Binance (BNB), to the up-and-coming Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) during the presale. This recommendation has caused a stir in the market, with many investors looking to understand the reasoning behind this suggestion. Let\u2019s examine the details.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN)\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) is an innovative crowdfunding platform that bridges the gap between investors and startups looking for funding. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) stands out from other traditional platforms with its decentralized approach, which offers four key features:\n\n1) Blockchain technology \u2013 Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is built on a blockchain-based infrastructure, which ensures the highest levels of security and immutability.\n\n2) Equity-based NFTs \u2013 Rather than purchasing traditional shares, investors can now buy equity-based NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that represent a certain percentage of the company\u2019s total value.\n\n3) Smart contracts \u2013 All transactions conducted on the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) platform are secured and enforced by smart contracts, eliminating the need for manual processing.\n\n4) Utility tokens \u2013 The ORBN token provides Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) users with additional perks, such as staking rewards and discounts on fees.\n\nWhen all of these advantages are combined, it\u2019s easy to see how Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) could become the go-to platform in the billion-dollar crowdfunding industry. This is why many trading pros have suggested that investors consider switching from PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Binance (BNB) to Orbeon Protocol (ORBN).\n\nThe Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale is close to reaching capacity, and with its increasing popularity and the promise of new features in the pipeline, it\u2019s safe to say that we can expect great things from this platform.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE)\n\nIf you are an active trader in the cryptocurrency world, you\u2019ll know that PancakeSwap (CAKE) is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges (DEXs). PancakeSwap (CAKE) has consistently been a top-performing DEX in terms of daily volume, with PancakeSwap (CAKE)\u2019s \u201cYield Farming\u201d and other Defi offerings being extremely attractive to investors.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t used PancakeSwap (CAKE) before, the DEX makes it effortless for users to exchange tokens within a single click, removing the necessity of using centralized exchanges.\n\nBut the top benefit of PancakeSwap (CAKE) is the pool of liquidity and the ability to earn rewards by providing liquidity. Traders can easily stake their assets in PancakeSwap (CAKE) pools and receive CAKE as a reward for staking.\n\nHowever, while PancakeSwap (CAKE) has become one of the go-to DEXs in the crypto space, PancakeSwap (CAKE) is still down more than 89% from its 2021 peak of $44.18. As such, investors may be looking to switch to a more promising protocol that can offer higher returns, and this is where Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) comes in.\n\nBinance (BNB)\n\nBinance (BNB) is the most well-known and biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. In fact, if you\u2019ve ever bought a cryptocurrency, chances are it was on Binance (BNB).\n\nBinance (BNB) offers features such as spot trading, margin trading, and derivatives. Binance (BNB) has also expanded its service, with its own chain, DEX (decentralized exchange), and an NFT marketplace.\n\nHowever, despite its high popularity, Binance (BNB) is still down more than 50% since its 2021 peak of $690. This is the fault of the wider crypto market, as well as the fact that Binance (BNB) is a centralized platform.\n\nThe expert opinion on Binance (BNB) is that despite being one of the most popular exchanges and likely to return to its former glory, switching from Binance (BNB) to Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) could result in increased gains.\n\nFind Out More About The Orbeon Protocol Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\n\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"
