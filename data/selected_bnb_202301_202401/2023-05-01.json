        "content": "The USDC is a stablecoin matched 1:1 with the US Dollar. This coin is available to add to various crypto wallets, including MetaMask. Here\u2019s how to add USDC to your MetaMask wallet.\n\nHow to Add USDC to MetaMask Wallet\n\nBefore adding USD coins to your MetaMask wallet, you should first establish what network you want to hold USDC on (e.g. Polygon, Ethereum, etc.) Once you choose your network, you have to find that network\u2019s correct address.\n\nCoingecko is a good resource for finding the correct address for your choice of a network to deposit USDC. Here is a simple 4-step guide to get started:\n\nVisit the Coingecko USDC page. Select the \u2018Contract\u2019 button underneath the \u2018Info\u2019 heading on the top right of the page. Find the network you want to add USDC on your MetaMask Wallet for. Click the MetaMask icon, the service will automatically add USDC to your MetaMask account.\n\nThe USDC should be visible immediately upon completion of step 4. If you don\u2019t have a MetaMask account already, be sure to create one prior to these steps. If you have one, you can link the account to Coingecko, in order to quickly add your USDC to your network of choice.\n\nMetaMask wallets are non-custodial and have no central authority controlling them. Furthermore, the USDC contract addresses on Coingecko have been verified and approved by the respective networks. This means that your coins will be safe and secure in the MetaMask wallet."

        "content": "Send this page to someone via email\n\nA group of women is warning others to check their rental homes after they said they found a hidden camera in the bathroom of their Airbnb.\n\nVancouver resident Jamie Gladman booked a place on the Sunshine Coast in March for her 30th birthday and she needed a place that could accommodate a large group.\n\n\u201cIt had about 15 (reviews), but it was really good ratings,\u201d she told Global News. \u201cSo I just figured it\u2019s a newer place, but like it has good reviews, good ratings. It looked nice, so I booked it and was quick to correspond with the host, so (I) didn\u2019t see any issues.\u201d\n\nThe house in Sechelt could accommodate the group of 13 and two dogs and they booked it for two nights.\n\nOn the second night, Kennedy Calwell, who made a TikTok video of the incident, said they discovered a hidden camera in the bathroom, facing the shower.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cOne of our friends, Becca, she had just watched a video, I think, the day before, kind of talking about hidden cameras and how small they are and how they can be found anywhere, like in a showerhead, in an outlet,\u201d Calwell said.\n\n\u201cSo she had seen one in an outlet before, and that\u2019s why she started looking around the house and found one in an outlet in the bathroom.\u201d Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: \"So she had seen one in an outlet before, and that's why she started looking around the house and found one in an outlet in the bathroom.\"\n\nGladman said there were other issues with the house that also concerned them.\n\nBreaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens.\n\nShe said it was dirty when they arrived and had not been cleaned.\n\nShe said the host was not responding to their messages in a timely manner. There was random artwork on the walls in strange places and big pieces of art nailed to the wall in some of the bedrooms.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOne of their friends took a shower in one of the bathrooms and when she got out, Gladman said she could see a racial slur in the condensation on the mirror.\n\n\u201cAnd then there was a crack in the outlet in that washroom,\u201d Gladman added. \u201cSo that\u2019s what prompted her to have a look. She remembered the videos she\u2019d seen on TikTok.\u201d\n\n1:46 Airbnb host released on bail after alleged knife attack\n\nOne by one, the group examined the find, with some just unwilling to believe it, Calwell explained.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to believe it because that\u2019s such an invasion of privacy and so violating,\u201d she added. \u201cLike I personally did not want to believe it.\u201d\n\nGladman said the outlet didn\u2019t work and they tried researching online about hidden cameras, but they really didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of nowhere, middle of the night. Like, what are we supposed to do?\u201d she said. \u201cWe felt a little safe in numbers. And having the two dogs.\u201d\n\nGladman reported the incident to Sunshine Coast RCMP. Global News has reached out to the detachment multiple times but has not yet heard back.\n\n\u201cThat was just such an invasion of privacy,\u201d Calwell said.\n\n\u201cWho knows how long the camera had been there?\u201d Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: \"Who knows how long the camera had been there?\"\n\n3:15 B.C. couple struggles to get Airbnb refund\n\nBoth women say they are now nervous to book with an Airbnb again.\n\nIn a statement to Global News, Airbnb said \u201cWe ban hidden cameras and previously refunded the guest as we investigate this allegation.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe listing for the home has been suspended, Airbnb confirmed, while the investigation continues.\n\nThe company said it has attempted to contact the Sunshine Coast RCMP about the investigation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still waiting to hear from the RCMP officer about the lab analysis of the cameras,\u201d Gladwell said. \u201cBut it is it\u2019s still just jarring. It doesn\u2019t feel like it was real and now I\u2019ve done more research on how to detect these types of things or what to look out for.\u201d\n\nAccording to Norton.com, there are a number of ways to detect hidden cameras, including looking for suspicious objects, and other Wi-Fi networks and if necessary, using a hidden camera detector.\n\nBut Gladman and Calwell also had some advice \u2014 trust your gut.\n\n\u201cWe did get a weird vibe from the Airbnb,\u201d Calwell said. \u201cWe did have a bad gut feeling about it. So I guess listen to your gut.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether dropped on Monday afternoon in Asia on the first trading day of May, after concerns about the U.S. banking system resurfaced following news of U.S. regulators approving the sale of First Republic Bank\u2019s assets to JPMorgan. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also fell, except Binance\u2019s BNB, with Solana and Litecoin the biggest losers of the day. Most Asian equity markets were closed on Monday for the May 1 holiday.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin flirts with US$30,000, Ether regains US$1,900\n\nCrypto\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin fell 2.2% to US$28,640 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization gained 4.37% in the last seven days, and rose as high as US$31,005 in the last month.\n\nEther lost 2.83% to US$1,850, but traded 0.34% higher on the week. The world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency rose as much as US$2,137 in the last one month.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL was the day\u2019s biggest loser, dropping 4.72% in 24 hours to US$22.33. Litecoin lost 3.42% to US$87.59 \u2013 the second-biggest loser in 24 hours \u2013 although it gained 0.5% on the week.\n\nBNB, the native token of world\u2019s largest crypto exchange Binance, was the only gainer, rising 3.71% to US$333, and strengthened 1.39% on the week. Binance on Monday introduced Sui blockchain\u2019s SUI token to its Launchpool, which allows Binance users to stake their BNB and TrueUSD (TUSD) to farm the recently launched SUI.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.95% to US$1.18 trillion, while the total crypto market volume gained 66.78% to US$39.78 billion.\n\nNFT\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on a given day. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast Labs umbrella.\n\n\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), one of the biggest NFT collections by market capitalization, saw a surge in sales volume in the past 24 hours, jumping 6.24% to US$832,882 million, after dropping 59.41% in the last seven days, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nEquities\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed on Monday at 5:45 p.m. in Hong Kong. The S&P 500 Futures inched up 0.01%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.03% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.02%.\n\nMany Asian equity markets were closed on Monday. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 gained 0.92% and ended Monday on a 8.5-month high, driven by strong Japanese corporate earnings reports and a weak yen. The country\u2019s consumer confidence index increased to 35.4 in April from 33.9 in March, the highest since January 2022, according to Tradingeconomics.\n\nGlobal banking industry concerns resurfaced with news of JPMorgan Chase acquiring most assets of First Republic Bank in a deal arranged by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a government agency for deposit insurance supply to depositors in American commercial and savings banks. The share price of U.S.-based First Republic Bank plunged 43.20% on Friday after the lender reported a 40.8% drop in deposits, or around US$100 billion, since the start of the year.\n\nThe banking sector has now witnessed three major failures including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank that were also taken over by the FDIC.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s next move on interest rates is on May 3. Over the past year, the central bank has consistently raised rates to bring inflation down to its target range of 2%. U.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006.\n\n\u201cIt is highly anticipated that the Fed may hike the interest rates by 25 basis points,\u201d said Dhruvil Shah, vice-president of technology at Liminal, a wallet infrastructure and custody solutions platform. This will increase interest rates to around 5% to 5.25%, a level not seen since 2007.\n\nThe European Central Bank is reportedly expected to increase interest rates on Thursday but analysts are divided on the quantum of the hike.\n\nSee related article: Coinbase says SEC\u2019s legal threats punish transparency, undermine public listing process"
