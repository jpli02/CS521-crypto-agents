        "title": "Binance Launches Trading Bots, Shifts To Automation - TradingView",
        "content": "Premier crypto exchange Binance recently announced its shift towards automation with the introduction of Trading Bots.\n\nAccording to Binance, the move also coincides with the migration of its previous bot features such as Rebalancing Bot, whose functionality is now integrated into the new (generalized) Trading Bot.\n\nIntroducing #Binance's updated Trading Bots.Automate trades using a number of strategies including:\ud83d\udd38 Spot Grid\ud83d\udd38 Futures Grid\ud83d\udd38 Rebalancing Bots\ud83d\udd38 Auto-InvestAnd more!Get all the details here \ud83d\udc47\u2014 Binance (@binance) May 11, 2023\n\nCrypto trading bots are software programs designed to execute buy and sell orders for cryptocurrencies at optimal times. Binance plans to release various functions to users by June 2023 as part of the implementation.\n\nAutomated crypto trading is a method of trading cryptocurrencies using software programs or bots that automatically execute buy and sell orders based on predefined rules and algorithms. This approach eliminates the need for manual intervention, allowing traders to streamline their trading strategies and capitalize on market opportunities 24/7.\n\nThe primary goal of automated crypto trading is to maximize profits while minimizing risks. To achieve this, traders develop strategies based on technical indicators, price patterns, and other market data. These strategies are then programmed into trading bots, which execute orders on behalf of the trader.\n\nTrading bots can be customized to follow various trading strategies, such as arbitrage, market making, trend following, and mean reversion.\n\nIn the case of Binance's new trading automation scheme, new spot and futures grids will be created. Users will have the option to run futures grids through their Trading Bots account while trading on the same symbol through their futures account simultaneously. Additionally, users will earn hourly trading fee savings for the Trading Bots account when utilizing their BNB balances.\n\nThe announcement of this new trading feature has increased on-chain activity for BNB Chain, with daily active users rebounding to a 5-week high over the 24 hours since its implementation. However, the chain's liquidity has continued to decline, with the total value locked (TVL) on the BNB Chain falling by over 3% to roughly $5.22 billion.\n\nRecently, Binance announced its exit from the Canadian crypto market, citing unfavorable regulatory frameworks from the country.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "title": "ZK Rollup Showdown: Comparing zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, and zk-BNB for Scalability Solutions - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "WEB3\n\nZK Rollups are a layer-2 solution that collects transactions off the main blockchain and batch them into a single transaction, thereby increasing throughput while reducing gas fees. \u200d\n\nTL;DR:\n\nZero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups) are a Layer-2 solution for blockchain scalability.\n\nzkSync uses zk-rollups for Ethereum's layer-two blockchain, with gas fees 1/100 of L1 gas and reportedly supporting over 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nPolygon zkEVM uses zero-knowledge proofs to reduce transaction costs and increase throughput while inheriting Ethereum's security, with a lower throughput of 2,000 TPS.\n\nZkBNB can package hundreds of transactions and generate cryptographic proofs as zkRollups, allowing users to trade digital assets without permission and offering developers the opportunity to build marketplaces for NFTs.\n\nThe three zk solutions are developer-friendly, allowing easy porting of Ethereum dApps.\n\n\u200d\n\nZk Rollup: Layer-2 Solutions for Blockchain Scalability\n\nBlockchain technology has come a long way in recent years, but one problem still looms large: scalability. As the number of users and transactions continues to increase, the limitations of blockchain become more apparent. That's where Layer-2 solutions like Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups) come in. ZK Rollups are considered the ultimate Layer-2 solution for blockchain-related scalability problems, and they can potentially transform the way we use blockchain technology. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the innovations in the zk-rollup space, focusing on three main players: zkSync Era, zk-BNB, and zk-Polygon.\n\nWhat is zkSync:\n\nThe zkSync blockchain uses zk-rollups as a scaling technology for Ethereum's layer-two blockchain. In a similar fashion to optimistic rollups, zk-rollups gather transactions off the Ethereum mainnet and submit their proofs to Ethereum. By doing this, hundreds of transactions are batched into one, verified and secured by Ethereum.\n\nWith zkSync, each batch of transactions is passed to an off-chain provision that generates cryptographic proof (called a SNARK) that they are valid. Verifying the validity of the proof is easier than developing the proof. The ease of this process means that it can be sent to Layer 1 and confirmed in a smart contract. As a result, transfers between Layers 1 and 2 are near-frictionless.\n\nFurthermore, since it is EVM compatible, you can easily transfer existing Layer 1 smart contracts to Layer 2.\n\nMoreover, zkSync with its V2 version it can reportedly support over 100,000 transactions per second once ETH2 data sharding is available. According to zkSync, gas fees are 1/100 of L1 gas and cheaper than optimistic rollups.\n\nFurther, the main Ethereum blockchain secures the assets, and you can move your assets back to L1 at any time.\n\nWhat is Polygon ZkEVM:\n\nThe Polygon zkEVM takes advantage of zero-knowledge proofs' scaling power. In fact, it's the first zero-knowledge scaling solution that is entirely equivalent to an EVM.\n\nzkEVM uses ZK proofs to reduce transaction costs and increase throughput while inheriting Ethereum's security. Polygon zkEVM has a lower throughput of 2,000 TPS.\n\nFurther Polygon zkEVM makes transactions much more efficient by creating a parallel chain to the main Polygon network using zk-proofs. It allows transactions to be validated without exposing sensitive information, making them faster and more secure.\n\nMoreover, Polygon zkEVM allows developers and users to use the same code, apps, and tooling but reportedly with much better performance and lower fees. By leveraging Ethereum's network effects, EMV-compatible zkEVMs can benefit from EMV's benefits.\n\nThe zkEVM allows users to deposit assets from Ethereum and transact off-chain. All of these transactions are grouped into batches, and a zero-knowledge proof confirms each transaction's validity. By doing this, the operators of zkEVM cannot steal user funds.\n\nAdditionally, it allows smart contracts on L2 to perform transactions that can be verified on L1 without the need for nodes to re-execute them.\n\nWhat is ZkBNB:\n\nThe ZkBNB has the same capability of packaging (or \"rolling-up\") hundreds of transactions and generating cryptographic proofs as zkRollups. It is possible to prove the validity of each transaction in the Rollup Block using SNARKs (succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge). In this way, it ensures that all funds are held on the BSC, while computations and storage are performed on the BNB Sidechains, at a much lower cost and more quickly.\n\nAccording to the protocol, ZkBNB is just as secure as BNB Smart Chain because it uses zk-SNARK proofs.\n\nFurthermore, zkBNB's built-in liquidity pools allow users to trade digital assets without permission. zkBNB also offers developers the opportunity to build marketplaces for crypto collectibles and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIn addition to supporting 100 million addresses, zkBNB can reportedly handle up to 10 thousand transactions per second (TPS), and gas fees can be reduced by up to 10x. Moreover, if a user feels that his transactions are censored by zkBNB, they can withdraw funds at any time.\n\nSimilarities and Differences\n\nZK-rollup has several advantages over other scaling solutions, such as Sidechains and Plasma.\n\nRollup validators cannot tamper with the states or embezzle money.\n\nIt is also possible for users to retrieve their funds from the Rollup even if the validators stop cooperating. Due to the readily available data, it is easier to access than in Plasma.\n\nValidity proofs eliminate the need for users or other trusted parties to monitor Rollup blocks online.\n\nThe three zk solutions discussed here are developer-friendly, allowing easy porting of Ethereum dApps.\n\nIn spite of the similarities between these projects, there is one critical difference that sets zkSync apart. In contrast to Polygon's zkEVM and zk-BNB, zkSync does not support bytecode. With bytecode compatibility, Ethereum's core code can be easily ported to Layer 2 networks with minimal changes.\n\nAs well, zkSync requires projects to be compiled using its LLVM-based compiler before they can be used on its network. Due to this approach, zkSync differs slightly from the other two zk solutions.\n\nSince zkSync Era launched, the project has accumulated a total value locked (TVL) of $249 million, according to L2 Beat. It is significantly higher than the $8.4 million on Polygon's chain of zkEVM. This discrepancy can attributed to the airdrop hype around zkSync Era.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs allow individuals to verify their identities without divulging sensitive personal information. As an alternative to providing identity details, users can simply verify that they meet specific criteria, such as a decentralized identity that verifies their citizenship without sharing their name or passport number.\n\nEven though all current zk solutions offer several advantages for the crypto space, it will take time to see which one wins since the technology is still relatively new and many innovations have yet to be implemented."
