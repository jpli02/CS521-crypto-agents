        "content": "We\u2019re seeing a lot of green lately, which means that crypto prices are recovering. Therefore, it is time to find coins and tokens that will offer you the best return on your investment. We asked crypto analysts to compare what Binance Coin (BNB) and HedgeUp (HDUP) have to offer in terms of returns. Read on to find out what we got.\n\nBy Advertiser, in Crypto \u00b7 26 May 2023, 14:00 \u00b7 0 Comments\n\n>> Buy HedgeUp Now <<\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\n\n\n\n\nBNB is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It is an exchange-based token that is issued by the largest centralized crypto exchange Binance.\n\nThe crypto asset was launched in 2017. It was originally created as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain before being migrated to its own blockchain in 2019.\n\nGiven its association with Binance, BNB has seen massive growth in the last four years. This was especially the case for the 2021 bull market, which saw BNB\u2019s value go from around $38 at the start of the year to peak at $686.31 on May 10th.\n\nIts price has dropped since then. It's currently trading at around $305. However, this price is much higher than its value before the start of the previous bull run, something that cannot be said for most other assets.\n\nIt also puts BNB as the fourth largest token when ranked by market capitalization. With a market cap of close to $50 billion, it is only behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT).\n\nSo, how does it look as an investment prospect?\n\nExperts say not bad. Cryptocurrency has been showing encouraging signs since the start of the year. So, when the market does recover, its price will likely go up. However, experts don\u2019t expect it to experience the same rates of growth as it did in the previous bull run.\n\nThey say BNB will certainly gain enough to beat its previous ATH and even cross the thousand-dollar mark. So, $1000 worth of investment will make you $2000 net returns.\n\n>> Buy HedgeUp Now <<\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about HedgeUp (HDUP)?\n\n\n\n\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP) is a much newer token than BNB. It is not even available to buy on exchanges yet. The token is in its presale phase, meaning investors are invited to buy HedgeUp (HDUP) directly from the project at a discounted rate.\n\nThe HedgeUp (HDUP) presale is scheduled to go on for eight stages. Two stages have already been completed and it's currently halfway through the third stage where it is being sold for $0.020.\n\nThe potential for returns arises from the fact that each stage has its own price. The price is increased with each subsequent stage. For example, the scheduled price for the fourth stage is $0.0364, and the final price of the presale will be $0.0887.\n\nThis means that for an investment made now, the net returns at the end of the presale will be in the region of 343%. So a $1000 investment will be worth $4430, and that\u2019s just with the presale.\n\nExperts estimate that HedgeUp (HDUP) will offer as much as 3000% returns when it launches on the market. Therefore, a $1000 investment has the potential to be worth $132,900 in the next bull run.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the links below for more information about HedgeUp (HDUP) presale:\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "OGDENSBURG, New York (WWNY) - The Claire House in Ogdensburg has been standing tall since 1844. Its newest stewards are Rachel and Harold Kench.\n\n\u201cThe house was originally built in 1844 and was the rectory for St. Mary\u2019s Cathedral, which burned down in 1947,\u201d Rachel Kench said, \u201cso the priests had lived there for around 75 years.\u201d\n\nAfter the fire, a nursing home was built where the cathedral was. The rectory became a home for nuns who cared for the nursing home patients.\n\nThe building has had many residents through the years, and some decided to stick around.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, we have Bishop Conroy, who is our most prominent ghost,\u201d Harold Kench said. \u201cHe has his own room in the house. Then there\u2019s the skeleton-faced lady.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s a little girl. She has her own space in the house and wasn\u2019t happy to share it with the Kenches\u2019 5-year-old nephew.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I was sitting on her sofa, and she said this is mine and she pushed me off,\u2019\u201d Rachel Kench said.\n\nThe Kenches are restoring the old home, so contractors have been in and out. One decided he would not be returning.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018there\u2019s a lot going on up there, there\u2019s an older man, there\u2019s a little girl,\u2019\u201d Racehl Kench said, \u201cand then he did point further away into our kitchen and said, \u2018what\u2019s over here\u2019 and I said, \u2018the basement,\u2019 and he told me \u2014 which freaked me out \u2014 \u2018she wants you guys to dig down there.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother time, the family was discussing abortion rights and was made aware of the ghostly stance on that matter.\n\nWith so many sightings, the family reached out to the show \u201cGhost Hunters.\u201d After their investigation, they decided to make the home their season finale, which aired Thursday night.\n\n\u201cThey did give us a lot of clarity about a lot of things,\u201d Rachel Kench said. \u201cIt was good to get their perspective because sometimes we\u2019re like, are we going crazy?\u201d\n\nIf you haven\u2019t watched the episode yet, here\u2019s a little teaser:\n\n\u201cThey did find stuff, they have evidence, and they had to bring cadaver dogs,\u201d Rachel Kench said.\n\nYou can find \u201cThe Claire House\u201d episode on Discovery Plus or the Travel Channel on Demand.\n\nYou can also plan to visit the Claire House as the Kench family is making it a haunted bed and breakfast and a community fixture.\n\nCopyright 2023 WWNY.

        "content": "Finlay Morrison, 14, has family from Harris and has spoken Gaelic more or less his entire life.\n\nHis passion for performing and acting eventually led him to star in Tri\u00f9ir aig Tr\u00ec (below) \u2013 a show about the adventures of two sisters running an bed and breakfast on a fictional island and their friend Marco.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a comedy-drama for kids that\u2019s set in four parts in a Gaelic-speaking community\u201d, the young actor told The National.\n\n\u201cTheir dad owns this bed and breakfast and the girls put a lot of work in so it\u2019s really just about the adventures they get up to with their friend Marco.\u201d\n\nJourney to acting\n\nMorrison, from the Southside of Glasgow, explained that his \u201cspark for storytelling\u201d started when he took some drama classes at the Citizen\u2019s Theatre.\n\n\u201cI got involved with a production of Cyrano de Bergerac which was a great experience. It was my first acting job and then through school I heard about Gaelic voiceovers and on the side I was doing my own stuff wiring films and recording things.\u201d\n\nHis work led him to FilmG - a Gaelic short film competition - where he first picked up a prize in 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: Question Time: Theo Paphitis bemused by Tory MP's immigration stance\n\nThrough this, he landed his role in Tri\u00f9ir aig Tr\u00ec and has never looked back since.\n\nImportance of Gaelic\n\nBeing able to speak Gaelic is something Morrison takes a lot of pride in and he hopes that the TV show he stars in can act as a springboard for greater success.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be a Gaelic speaker and I love to be able to tie that in with my acting. If I can do both at the same time then it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nOn the show, he believes youngsters seeing the language on-screen is the perfect way to help normalise it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great immersion in the language not just for kids going through education but for those who don\u2019t have it spoken in the house.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stepping stone to the future of Gaelic kids TV and it has an important place in Gaelic culture.\n\n\u201cIt means people don\u2019t just associate it with learning. My Gaelic teacher showed it in class and it put smiles on the faces of students and teachers.\u201d\n\nFinlay\u2019s mum, Kathleen, echoes her son's thoughts and explains that the feedback from parents whose children had watched the show was all positive.\n\nWhat is FilmG?\n\nAs well as winning a prize back in 2020, Morrison also picked up two awards at this year's ceremony in February.\n\nHe won Best Youth Performance and picked up the Rising Star Award for a short film that he and his brother had put together.\n\nEven though it wasn\u2019t his first win, Morrison particularly enjoyed this year\u2019s event as 2020\u2019s was forced to be held online due to the pandemic.\n\nHe explained: \u201cWe took inspiration from stuff on Alba and elements of Tri\u00f9ir aig Tr\u00ec went into our films. We wanted to make it fun and be a bit daft and so we did an impersonation of a Gaelic TV host.\n\nREAD MORE: Edinburgh was second most-visited UK city in 2022, tourism data shows\n\n\u201cI think as we\u2019ve gone on the films have got more professional. They\u2019ve been set around an actual script rather than just something we\u2019ve shot in a day.\u201d\n\nHis mum added: \u201cI\u2019m massively proud of him and his brother because they did such a great job and worked so hard.\u201d\n\nTri\u00f9ir aig Tr\u00ec is available on BBC iPlayer now."
