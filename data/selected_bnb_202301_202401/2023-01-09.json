        "content": "According to data from crypto staking data provider Staking Rewards, Polygon (MATIC) is the top staking asset in the first week of 2023. The firm noted that the network hit an all-time high for its staking balance of $3.55 billion. MATCI\u2019s weekly inflow increased to $127.99 million, accounting for a 4.60% rise.\n\nState of Staking | 09.01.2023\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/2CPuaLGOd9 \u2014 Staking Rewards (@StakingRewards) January 9, 2023\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is closely followed by Ethereum (ETH), which had an inflow of $122.01 million, a 0.57% increase. The largest Altcoin may be in for a positive scenario as the imminent Shanghai upgrade dominates market attention.\n\nThe upgrade which is planned for March 2023, will greatly lower the risk associated with staking ETH. Furthermore, it will give liquidity staking platforms a chance to develop. Hence, as the anticipation grows, some of these protocols\u2019 governance tokens are rallying over the past week.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is followed by Cardano (ADA), with an inflow of $78.20 million, a 1.1% increase. Additionally, Cardano (ADA) is one of the best-performing crypto projects this week, with a 17.6% rally in the last 24 hours, and 30.5% in the last week.\n\nCrypto projects with poor staking performance\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) has the highest outflows at the moment. The exchange\u2019s native token witnessed outflows of $12.61 million, a 0.20% drop. However, BNB is still close to its ATH staking balance. Moreover, the reward rate decreases as the staking balance increase for BNB. Therefore, the reward rate has dropped to an all-time low of 2.4%.\n\nGMX had the second-highest outflow this week. The project witnessed outflows of $6.94 million, a 1.90% decrease. Lastly, GMX is followed by Flow and Radix, which witnessed outflow rates of 0.51% and 1.80%, respectively. At press time, the global crypto market cap stood at $884 Billion, up by 3.1% in the last 24 hours."

        "title": "Binance sees $12B withdrawn in 60 days - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Binance has experienced a significant outflow of assets in the past two months, a recent report from Forbes found.\n\nForbes analysts dove deep into Binance\u2019s wallets and found that the exchange saw around $12 billion of outflows since November.\n\nAside from the massive outflows, the report finds the discrepancy between reports of Binance\u2019s holdings troubling. A lack of consensus among analytics platforms led Forbes to worry about foul play within the exchange, as some reports showed gaps of several billion dollars in Binance\u2019s wallets.\n\nHowever, the report only briefly addresses the state of the broad crypto market and underestimates its effect on Binance\u2019s holdings.\n\nDiscrepancies in Binance\u2019s asset reports\n\nEarlier in December, Binance made news as on-chain data showed the exchange lost $3 billion of assets in a single week. The exchange saw 4% of its total asset balance withdrawn, sending the market into a frenzy. At the time, Binance\u2019s CEO Changpeng Zhao assured customers that the withdrawal amount wasn\u2019t even among the exchange\u2019s five largest and that there was no cause for concern.\n\nA Forbes report found that the exchange lost 15% of its assets since then. The exchange\u2019s balance of BNB, its native token, was slashed in half since November. The number of BUSD stablecoins sitting on the exchange also decreased by 40%. Forbes noted that MATIC, APE, and GALA balances on the exchange also dropped between 40% and 50%.\n\nAggregating data from various crypto data firms showed that almost a quarter of Binance\u2019s assets were drained from the exchange since the beginning of November.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, around 31% of Binance\u2019s total assets sat in BNB on Jan. 4. This is significantly higher than the amount Binance disclosed in its November transparency report. However, Forbes believes that the 57 million BNB tokens reported by CoinMarketCap are \u201cquestionable.\u201d\n\nNamely, the number contrasts sharply with the number of BNB identified by Nansen, DefiLlama, and Arkham, which range from 22 million to 40 million tokens. Forbes\u2019 own analysis of Etherscan found only 16 million BNB on the exchange.\n\nAround 40% of Binance\u2019s BUSD balance also left the exchange since November. The discrepancy between the data provided by analytics firms led Forbes to believe that Binance itself reported holding several billion BUSD less than the numbers provided by Nansen and DefiLlama.\n\nThe report also found discrepancies in Binance\u2019s BTC holdings. The number of tokens held by the exchange varied from 287,000 BTC to as much as 577,000 BTC. Analysis company CER.LIVE reportedly identified $9.6 billion in BTC in Binance\u2019s wallets, which is more than twice the amount shown both by Glassnode and CoinMarketCap.\n\nForbes\u2019 own estimate that Binance holds 4.49 million ETH is much higher than numbers shown on other platforms \u2014 CoinMarketCap estimates the exchange only holds around 2.58 million ETH.\n\nYou win some, you lose some\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Binance hasn\u2019t only been bleeding assets since November.\n\nWhile the exchange lost a significant number of BUSD, it saw its USDT and USDC balances double during the same period. The exchange now holds a combined $6.27 billion worth of the two stablecoins.\n\nForbes dismissed the possibility of Binance\u2019s outflows being a result of broader market turmoil. Its analysis looked at exchanges with publicly available proof of funds and found that Binance saw the most outflows in the past 30 days. Other large market players such as Crypto.com, Bitfinex, Huobi, Bitmex, and OKEX saw only single-digit changes in their assets.\n\n\u201cThe situation indicates that there are trust issues concerning Binance, and its position as the largest crypto market raises the possibility of contagion should those prove well funded,\u201d Forbes noted.\n\nThe publication concluded that the exchange is experiencing a \u201csoft run on the bank\u201d and that there is a possibility the run could intensify.\n\nThe possibility of Binance seeing a devastating bank run certainly is there. However, the Forbes report failed to address Binance\u2019s size and hasn\u2019t contributed the scale of its outflows to the number of users it services. It also doesn\u2019t consider the volumes Binance handles \u2014 having a similar percentage of users withdraw assets from a smaller exchange would result in a much smaller total sum of outflows.\n\nThere is also the case of its rising USDT and USDC balances. A decrease in its BUSD and BNB holdings could be a result of its users swapping the exchange\u2019s own tokens into less volatile and much larger stablecoins.\n\nMentioned in this article"
