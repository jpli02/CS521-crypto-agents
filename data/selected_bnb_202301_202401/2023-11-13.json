        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin continues to be the talk of the town based on its current bullish run after months of stagnation, thanks to heightened optimism about the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAs a result, veteran trader Peter Brandt believes a pennant is being formed on the Bitcoin network, and this is bullish because it could propel the pioneer cryptocurrency to the $43,000 level.\n\nSource: Peter Brandt\n\nBTC was trading at $36,773 at press time, according to CoinGecko data. Therefore, Brandt suggests that Bitcoin could experience a 15.7% surge if the pennant formation sees the light of day.\n\nA pennant depicts a continuing bullish pattern during an uptrend, comprising converging trendlines and a flagpole, which depicts the previous price increase. Therefore, the pennant formation shows a short-ranging market before the resumption of an uptrend.\n\nTherefore, if the present bullish pennant formation materializes, Brandt is optimistic that Bitcoin\u2019s price could soar to highs of $43,289.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, a market analyst under the pseudonym CryptoJelleNL was of a similar opinion that Bitcoin was not yet done with its current surge because it was eyeing $48,000. This is because the apex cryptocurrency had broken out of the bullish megaphone formation, as reported by ZyCrypto.\n\nTherefore, these sentiments show that Bitcoin bulls have not thrown in the towel yet, as their quest to maintain the present uptrend is still alive.\n\nMeanwhile, top analyst Michael van de Poppe suggested that a bearish divergence was not yet validated on the BTC network.\n\nHe added that even if Bitcoin were to drop to $35,000, the market remained optimistic because an uptrend would continue.\n\nSource: Michael van de Poppe\n\nA bearish divergence is a pattern that signals a potential downtrend because prices usually soar to a new high, but the oscillator fails to reach this peak."

        "title": "XRP, Ether, Solana, Cardano, Shiba Inu Brace For $1 Trillion \u2018Bull Shock\u2019 As Spot Bitcoin ETF Comes Nigh - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe prospect of spot Bitcoin ETFs has long been a dream for investors and traders alike. Amidst this anticipation, recent reports from esteemed data analytics platforms have set the crypto community abuzz, predicting a staggering $1 trillion market cap for crypto majors like Bitcoin, XRP, Ether, Solana, Cardano, and Shiba Inu if spot ETFs receive the green light.\n\nA report, crafted by the experts at CryptoQuant delves into the historical context that has shaped Bitcoin\u2019s market trajectory. The first wave of institutional adoption witnessed during Bitcoin\u2019s historic bull run in 2021 saw institutions adding BTC to their balance sheets. According to CryptoQuant researchers, the next significant wave of adoption is already underway, marked by major Asset Under Management [AUM] entities making Bitcoin accessible to their clients through spot ETFs.\n\nThe only hurdle on this promising path seems to be approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC], an obstacle that has kept the crypto community on edge. However, recent favourable court rulings in the GBTC and XRP lawsuits against the regulator have injected a newfound optimism into the market.\n\nCryptoQuant\u2019s experts have brought forth a compelling analysis that could fuel the already bullish sentiment in the crypto sphere. Historically, during bull markets, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap has risen at a rate of 3\u20135 times higher than its realized cap. According to the report, for every $1 that pours into the Bitcoin network, its market cap could potentially surge by $3 to $5. If this pattern holds true and spot ETFs secure approval, Bitcoin\u2019s price could skyrocket, reaching astronomical figures ranging between $50,000 and $73,000.\n\nRecall how a false rumour of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval sent the crypto community to a tizzy as BTC soared. Although this incident serves as a cautionary tale, if the predicted scenario unfolds and spot ETFs are approved, the entire crypto landscape could enter a prolonged period of bullish momentum, where the bears might find it challenging to resist the rising tide."

Discover SCENE\n\nWhile a fledgling industry, blockchain gaming has already faced massive challenges\u2014resulting in a swath of games being put on indefinite pause by their respective developers, while others switch chains.\n\nIn 2022, a staggering 157 blockchain games were \u201chalted\u201d or otherwise stopped development, while another 43 titles were halted in 2023, according to a new Game7 report on the state of the Web3 gaming industry. Game7 is a decentralized community or DAO focused on blockchain gaming adoption.\n\nGame7 core contributor George Isichos told Decrypt that the blockchain or \u201cWeb3\u201d games that stopped development this year struggled to get financial support and were generally titles that were established before 2021.\n\nFinancial troubles trip up games\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost of the blockchain games that stopped development or live support this year were also mainly from very small studios, whereas very few \u201cAA\u201d or \u201cAAA\u201d games were shut down. Game7 defines \u201cAA\u201d as a studio with about $10-25 million in funding, and \u201cAAA\u201d studios as those with over $25 million in funding.\n\nDespite this, the majority of Web3 games are actually still indie games, according to the report, with 42% of Web3 games classified as \u201cindie\u201d or developed by individuals or small teams without any financial backers or publishers. Some 40% of Web3 games are \u201cmidsize,\u201d meaning they have secured $10 million or less in funding.

Competition among blockchains vying for game developers to use their networks has spiked as a result, and is correlated with a rise in developers switching chains this year.\n\nWhile most blockchain games still use a layer-1 blockchain like Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, many have adopted Ethereum-compatible sidechains or scaling networks instead. About 81% of current blockchain games use a non gaming-focused layer-1 blockchain, according to Game7.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is overwhelmingly the most popular choice for blockchain games, with 74% of games choosing to use an EVM network.
