        "content": "Janel Faraci had just finished a bout with breast cancer when she decided to buy the Rogers House in November 2019, with ambitions of remaking the historic Lincoln bed-and-breakfast in the image of her father, Hollywood production manager Clark Paylow.\n\nFour years later, things haven\u2019t gone exactly according to plan. A global pandemic drained her finances, and Nebraska winters have taken a physical and mental toll on the Los Angeles native.\n\nNow, just under four years after she bought it, Faraci said she\u2019s moving to Florida and passing on the keys to the Near South landmark on the corner of 22nd and B streets. The building, which since its construction in 1914 has served as a banker\u2019s retirement homestead and chapter house for UNL\u2019s Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, will now house a family of 11 from York who are set to move in on June 28.\n\nFaraci\u2019s issues with the house date back to the original purchase, at the onset of winter and just a handful of months before the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered businesses across the country. The Rogers House stayed open throughout, but it came at a cost.\n\n\u201cI put so much money into the business, I really did,\u201d Faraci said.\n\nShe\u2019d also planned to rely on doing more year-round events at the inn, such as weddings and Hollywood-themed parties, but was consistently frustrated by the nature of Nebraska weather.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either really hot or really cold,\u201d Faraci said. \u201cComing from L.A. (where she operated sober living facilities), when I would have an event, it\u2019s 75 on Christmas, it\u2019s 75 on Thanksgiving, it\u2019s 75 at Easter; I was really envisioning more event time.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, she said she struggled to compete with downtown hotels for guests during the city\u2019s peak tourism season in the fall when Husker football takes the field.\n\nThe weather affected more than just her bottom line. The state\u2019s harsh winters did a number on the California businesswoman, who maintained a steady regimen of chemotherapy throughout. Every year seemed to be worse than the last.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d spend more and more time in the hospital with pneumonia or RSV or something else that was triggered by the after effects (of chemo),\u201d Faraci said. \u201cSo every winter, the doctors used to say \u2018You\u2019re not going to make it through another winter here, you need to sell the inn.\u2019\u201d\n\nFaraci said her condition had worsened so much by this March that her doctors demanded that she sell the Rogers House, and she agreed.\n\n\u201cI put it on the market the next day, and the first people that walked through bought it,\u201d she said.\n\nIt wasn't the first time she'd considered selling the inn \u2014 Faraci also put the Rogers House up for sale once in July 2020 and three other times in March, June and September of 2022, but was never satisfied by the offers she received.\n\nThis month's sale was ideal because it allowed her to maintain the Rogers House LLC, which she can use to keep the phone line open in order to redirect potential customers to the nearby Martha\u2019s Bed and Breakfast, earning commissions through a partnership with Martha\u2019s owner Todd Knoble.\n\n\u201cThis deal fit exactly to what I needed,\u201d Faraci said.\n\nFaraci said she also plans to reroute reservations that had been made for beyond the June 28 sale date to Martha's.\n\nDespite the previous attempts to sell the inn, the final sale came as a shock to Melissa Buss, an associate of Faraci who served as the live-in innkeeper when Faraci bought the property in 2019.\n\nBuss left in July 2020 before returning in December 2022 with her partner, Kevin Dill, on the understanding that Faraci would sell the house to her in 12 months when Buss and Dill would be financially capable of buying.\n\nOver the next handful of months, the pair fell in love with the lifestyle of innkeeping, getting to know an eclectic array of guests, serving up breakfast and even handling late-night maintenance calls.\n\nWhen they learned this spring that Faraci had decided to sell the property ahead of schedule to another buyer, the two were stunned.\n\n\u201cYou put in all this effort and somebody yanks it away from you,\u201d said Dill, although he\u2019s trying to keep a positive mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s a life process of, \u2018Did we learn from this adventure?\u2019 Did we learn from this process?'\"\n\nBuss said she was even more hurt by the potential effect on the Rogers House\u2019s repeat visitors, many of whom had weddings and other cherished memories at the bed-and-breakfast.\n\n\u201cWe just want to honor the history of it,\u201d Buss said. \u201cWe feel bad for all of our patrons that have come year after year and have memories there that they\u2019re not going to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nFaraci said she can understand why some patrons might be upset by the shuttering of the bed-and-breakfast, but that the circumstances require accepting some difficult realities.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stay open for people to have memories,\" she said. \"That would be a great thing to do if I won the lottery, but business-wise, it\u2019s not a great idea.\u201d\n\nBuss said she had hoped to carry on the tradition of Nora Houtsma, who bought the Rogers House in the mid-80s and ran it as a prolific bed-and-breakfast until selling to Faraci in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe both fell in love with the lifestyle of being innkeepers,\u201d Buss said.\n\nAlthough they were disappointed about the lost opportunity, Buss and Dill said they understand the difficult position Faraci was in and wish her good health going forward.\n\nHoutsma \u2014 the previous owner \u2014 said she sees the transfer in ownership as a return to the Rogers House\u2019s residential roots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very adaptable house,\u201d Houtsma said, empathizing with Buss by comparing the situation to another bed-and-breakfast property adjacent to the Rogers House that she eventually sold to a family.\n\n\u201cThere is a little bit of a sense of loss because we put our heart and soul in that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was also really good to see somebody come in that loved historic houses.\u201d\n\nHoutsma said she\u2019s optimistic that the Rogers House\u2019s new attendants will bring a similar level of care to the property.\n\n\u201cI can easily see how a family could just fit right into it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Rogers House will be selling a few items from the building's history during on a sale on Saturday, June 24 and Sunday, June 25.
