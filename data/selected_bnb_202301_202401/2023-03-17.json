        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIf Ripple wins the case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a relisting of the coin on America\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange could ensue.\n\nCoinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal has delved into the possibility of relisting XRP in a recent interview.\n\nWill Coinbase Relist XRP Promptly?\n\nWhen the SEC filed its suit in December 2020, many pundits and observers felt it was a death knell for XRP, as the token was delisted from most crypto exchanges globally, including Coinbase. At the time, Coinbase said the move was motivated by its Digital Assets Framework policy, which assesses factors like securities compliance.\n\nSpeaking to Tony Edward \u2014 host of the Thinking Crypto podcast, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer Paul Grewal acknowledged that this delisting had been a constant source of frustration for XRP fans.\n\nWhen asked whether Coinbase is planning to relist XRP after the court\u2019s ruling in the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, Grewal noted that it would depend on the grounds of the ruling, the judge\u2019s legal reasoning, and the exchange\u2019s assessment of whether or not the apex court would uphold the decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo a lot is going to depend on the particulars of that court rules. I know that\u2019s not going to be terribly satisfying to some, but we do have a responsibility as a publicly listed company to tread carefully in this area and with respect to any token that\u2019s a subject of federal court litigation,\u201d the CLO explained.\n\nHe, however, assured XRP holders that Coinbase would immediately begin the review process as soon as the ruling was made.\n\n\u201cBut I am very eager as anyone else to see how the court rules and what I can say, as soon as we have the ruling, we will put in our process to see if we need to revisit our listing decision.\u201d\n\nCoinbase Exec Praises Ripple\u2019s Attorneys Ahead Of Crucial Court Ruling\n\nYou might recall that Coinbase petitioned a federal court for permission to back Ripple\u2019s case against the SEC.\n\nIn his latest interview, Paul Grewal commended the incredible work of Ripple\u2019s legal team. \u201cI certainly paid attention to the fact that the defendants in this case have done a masterful job of pushing the SEC and raising serious questions about the SEC\u2019s entire theory,\u201d the CLO posited.\n\nGrewal revealed that these efforts by Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty and others at the San Francisco-based payments firm prompted Coinbase to file a friend of the court (\u201camicus\u201d) brief in the long-standing suit between the XRP progenitor and the SEC.\n\nLike most people in the crypto community, Grewal is impatiently awaiting a decision in the case, and he is optimistic that the judge will rule in Ripple\u2019s favour.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously speculated that the suit could be wrapped up by June but admitted that is only a guess."

        "content": "SCARE BNB The hotel room \u2018crime scene\u2019 that is shocking some holidaymakers \u2013 but it\u2019s not what it seems\n\nHOLIDAYMAKERS have been left horrified after stumbling across a \"crime scene\" in a four-star hotel.\n\nTravellers discovered the seemingly alarming sight while\n\nsearching for accommodation with travel site Expedia.\n\n2 Some users thought the pattern on the rug of the king suite looked like a \"crime scene\" Credit: Expedia\n\nA photograph of the serviced \u2018King Suite\u2019 in Bogota, Colombia shows a neutrally-decorated lounge area and kitchenette.\n\nIn the middle of the shot, however, there is a black coffee table and\n\nwhat appears to be large and suspicious stain splattered all over the\n\nfloor.\n\nBut it is not what it seems.\n\nThe \u2018stain\u2019 is actually the pattern on a cream rug - yet it is was\n\nenough to catch the eye of dozens of shocked travellers on Facebook.\n\nUnder an ad for the hotel, one stunned person wrote: \u201cWhy does this\n\nlook like a crime scene?!\u201d\n\nSomeone else replied: \u201cI thought that too. Fire damage? Shooting?\n\nTable trashed?!\u201d\n\nA third chipped in: \u201cCrime scene rug, a floating worktop and sink,\n\nwhat other secrets are you hiding in this room?\u201d\n\nAnd a fourth admitted: \u201cI\u2019ve zoomed in and still can\u2019t work out what\u2019s\n\nhappened!\u201d\n\nThe King Suite is one of several accommodation options on offer at a\n\nhotel called HotelCity Flats in Colombia\u2019s capital Bogot\u00e1.\n\nBooking prices for in the King Suite start at \u00a388-per-night.\n\nSleeping up to three guests, it comes with a 42-inch TV, a kingsize\n\nbed, single sofa bed free WiFi and a desk and ironing board.\n\nDespite the suspect photograph, travellers have rated HotelCity fans\n\n9.2 out of 10 on Expedia.\n\nOne review positively reads: \u201cCosy and very clean. Breakfast was very\n\ngood. Location excellent. Definitely I recommend this hotel.\u201d\n\nAnother person added: \u201cThe city Flats Hotel in Bogota in Zona Rosa is\n\none of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.\n\n\u201cWhile it may not be the fanciest hotel or have the most amenities,\n\nthe staff and service were exceptional.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, a casino hotel recently caused a stir when a guest claimed its carpets looked like they were covered in blood.\n\nThe gambler had arrived for a short stay and a flutter, but was disturbed at what they saw as a bizarre interior design option.\n\nThey shared a picture of the strange flooring on Reddit, to show other people exactly how bizarre it was.\n\nThey wrote: \"The casino hotel I stayed at a few days ago went with blood stained circuit board as its carpet pattern.\"\n\nThe room in the casino and the one in Bogota might have ended up being nicer than the crime scene some they were, but other hotels turn out to be a lot worse than they appear online.\n\nOne guest almost ended up in a crime scene, after he got a room with what he described as \"the worst view in the world\".\n\nComedian Neema Naz was staying in a hotel in Alberta, Canada when he made the horrifying discovery.\n\nHe said in a video he shared on TikTok: \"I'm in my hotel room and I was like 'wow, my blinds are closed - let me get some fresh light in here.'\n\n\"To then realise, this is my view - the ladies changing room, with a pool with kids in it.\n\n\"How about let me close the blinds actually so I don't get a peeping tom charge.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is a terrible place to have a window.\"\n\nMeanwhile, this could be Britain's worst hotel, with reviews calling it a \"hell hole\".\n\nAnd these are some of the worst hotels in the world, according to review site TripAdvisor."
