        "content": "Renowned financial educator and author Robert Kiyosaki has set the crypto world abuzz with his latest prediction, foreseeing Bitcoin (BTC) reaching an impressive $120,000. In the midst of this crypto whirlwind, VC Spectra (SPCT) and Binance Coin (BNB) have emerged equally as the best altcoins to invest in this year.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about how VC Spectra (SPCT) and Binance Coin (BNB) can shape your financial future.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nKiyosaki\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC) prediction takes the market by storm: BTC declines\n\nRobert Kiyosaki, the famous author of \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201d recently made a bold Bitcoin forecast that sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market. Kiyosaki, known for his financial expertise, had previously been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn his prediction, Kiyosaki suggested that Bitcoin (BTC) could face a decline in value before surging and reaching $120,000, causing concern among crypto enthusiasts and BTC investors. While he didn\u2019t provide specific details or a timeframe in his Bitcoin forecast, his statement alone led to heightened discussions and speculations in the Bitcoin (BTC) and overall crypto community.\n\nFollowing Kiyosaki\u2019s Bitcoin forecast, BTC experienced a temporary dip in its price. Dropping from $27,391 on September 18 to $26,749 on September 19. Experts, however, predict that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely trade between $26,500 and $29,000 per BTC in the coming months.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT): The king of new ICOs of 2023\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) has emerged as a standout player in the world of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in 2023, earning its crown as a top ICO of 2023. With its innovative approach and impressive presale performance, VC Spectra (SPCT) has set itself apart from the competition and captured the attention of investors seeking promising opportunities.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) operates as a decentralized hedge fund, offering investors access to various blockchain projects and startups. Its unique features, including algorithmic trading techniques and exclusive voting rights for investors, have made it a preferred choice for those looking to maximize their returns while maintaining control over their investments.\n\nThe presale journey of VC Spectra (SPCT) has been nothing short of remarkable. Starting with a private presale that raised an impressive $2.4 million, the platform continued to gain momentum in its public presale stages. Investors witnessed a significant 312.5% return, with SPCT prices surging by substantial percentages in each stage.\n\nAs VC Spectra (SPCT) prepares to launch on major exchanges at a target price of $0.08, current investors are poised to enjoy another 142.42% ROI. With a strong focus on investor safety, transparency, and a deflationary token model, VC Spectra (SPCT) is one of the best cryptos to invest in.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) Is taking a breather: Time to buy?\n\nUnlike the Bitcoin dominance trends, Binance Coin (BNB) faced a challenging period following the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance and other cryptocurrencies in April 2023, leading to a bearish trend for the BNB coin price. However, on August 27, Binance made a significant announcement by allocating a staggering $1 billion in BNB tokens, with the aim of introducing one billion new users to the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the wake of this news, the BNB coin price, which had been on a decline since the time of the lawsuit, experienced a remarkable resurgence. However, by September 19, the BNB coin price had declined again, dropping from $231 on August 29 to $216.\n\nDespite this decline, the BNB price prediction from experts remains optimistic, predicting that the BNB coin price could potentially reach as high as $265 by October, offering investors a glimmer of hope in the midst of market fluctuations.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra (SPCT) presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"

        "title": "Crypto Staking \u2013 The Islamic Perspective + Investing options - IslamicFinanceGuru \u2014 Islamic Finance Guru - Islamic Finance Guru",
        "content": "The rise of crypto-assets has given us new ways to make money. Staking is increasingly becoming popular now and there is a lot of money to be made. But the key question remains: is it halal?\n\nIn this article we cover:\n\nWhat staking is and how it works The Islamic perspective on staking What are the best options available to engage in staking\n\nWhat is staking?\n\nThere are currently two main ways of adding a \u2018block\u2019 to a blockchain.\n\n1) Proof of Work (PoW)\n\n2) Proof of Stake (PoS)\n\nThe most famous example of the proof of work system is Bitcoin. In this model, you use computing power to solve increasingly difficult mathematical puzzles to add a new block to the chain. By doing this you are rewarded with a coin.\n\nThe problem with this is the inefficiency and the cost of electricity required to mine new blocks because of having to solve increasingly difficult maths puzzles using increasingly powerful computers.\n\nProof of stake is a more efficient alternative to this.\n\nIn a proof of stake system users who own some of the cryptocurrency \u2018lock\u2019 or hold their funds in a wallet. Instead of having to solve maths puzzles to add blocks to the chain, users are selected at random based on how much currency they have locked up.\n\nThe user who is chosen at random is rewarded with a coin. Typically, how it works is the more coins you hold the more you can \u2018earn\u2019, so the size of your stake is directly proportional to the chances of being chosen to forge the next block and earning coins.\n\nStaking in a nutshell: lock up your coins to earn coins.\n\nThe Islamic Perspective on Staking\n\nStaking as a concept is not Islamically problematic. It is simply a rule-based approach used by a crypto project to decide who will get the right to add to the blockchain.\n\nThe IFG Fatwa Forum has covered the point briefly here.\n\nThere are a few important caveats to make here:\n\nEach crypto project has its own specific staking dynamics and so the particular rules of a crypto project may not necessarily be sharia-compliant if they throw in something novel. However, if they use very straightforward staking concepts, that should be fine. Staking is just a mechanism of creating new coins in a crypto project. You also need to make sure that the crypto project itself is sharia-compliant. So, for example, if a crypto project links itself directly with gambling, then regardless of how it uses staking, it will be imper.\n\nHowever staking must not be confused with liquidity mining or yield farming. Not all liquidity mining or yield farming is necessarily sharia-compliant.\n\nThe reason why the confusion arises is that both staking and liquidity mining involves investors buying and holding cryptocurrencies and getting a return for it. However, what is actually generating those returns under the hood are very different.\n\nWe will cover liquidity mining and yield farming in a separate article but a high-level summary is that liquidity is very helpful in crypto projects as it allows them to function.\n\nTwo core places liquidity can be very helpful is by allowing the exchange of cryptocurrencies and by allowing the lending out of cryptocurrencies. If you don\u2019t have liquidity, then exchanging and lending become very difficult.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that the two main sources of liquidity mining or yield farming seek to allow the flourishing of an ecosystem that either facilitates brokerage/exchange of cryptocurrencies or lending of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe latter is, rather unsurprisingly, impermissible, while the former is in principle permissible. However, as with all things crypto, the devil is in the detail and each new crypto project should be examined from first principles.\n\nIFG have prepared a list of the top 50 cryptocurrencies (by market cap) and shared our preliminary sharia assessment of these cryptocurrencies.\n\nThings to consider before staking\n\nWhat should you look out for when thinking about where to stake?\n\nReturns\n\nOf course, the primary incentive to stake is for the passive income it generates.\n\nThe reward from staking is dependent on many factors. The most important one being the network\u2019s protocol.\n\nIn addition to the protocol and price, different exchanges and platforms may differ in the percentage they offer when it comes to staking, so doing your own research is important to see how you can maximise your returns.\n\nYou also don\u2019t want to invest just for the staking rewards whilst the coin itself loses a lot of value. It is important to conduct some due diligence on the network and coin.\n\nYou would also need to hold some significant number of coins to see real returns.\n\nLiquidity\n\nCryptocurrencies are still very much a new type of investment, being available for just a few years for retail investors.\n\nThere are an increasing number of new currencies launching every day. It is important to ensure the that the coin you invest in is liquid and can be bought and sold easily.\n\nThe last thing you want is for your investment to be illiquid and highly volatile and not being able to convert to cash when you need to.\n\nKeep this in mind especially when putting money into lesser-known altcoins. Lower liquidity will also have an impact on volatility, so you may see massive swings in the value of your coins which may end up negating any staking rewards.\n\nEase\n\nThere are new protocols and projects popping up in the crypto world every day.\n\nTo engage in staking for some of the more obscure coins some amount of technical expertise is required in setting up the infrastructure and connecting your wallet and computer.\n\nHowever, the more well-known coins are available to stake on world-renowned exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance, where millions of people around the world buy and sell crypto every day.\n\nThese exchanges take care of all the infrastructure and technical aspects when it comes to buying and selling crypto and package it in a user-friendly UI.\n\nOf course, this ease of use comes with significant fees.\n\nFees\n\nAn important factor to consider when staking is the fee taken by an exchange or wallet which can eat into your returns.\n\nFirstly, you need to consider the fees charged as soon as you make a purchase of any coins. Most exchanges have a spread fee as well as a purchase fee. You also need to consider fees linked to methods of payment and withdrawal, such as debit card fees.\n\nMost importantly, you should look into the staking fee charged. Typically, how it works is the exchange you hold your coins with distributes the staking reward to you minus the commission, which can be as high as 25% at high-tier exchanges like Coinbase!\n\nTax\n\nSince trading and staking crypto is an investment, different governments and jurisdictions have been slowly adapting tax law in this direction.\n\nIn the UK for example, crypto exchanges offer fully taxable accounts since there is no ISA equivalent for a crypto at this moment in time.\n\nStaking is treated as miscellaneous income according to HMRC and would be taxed as such for the average retail investor. It is essential you keep any tax implications in mind.\n\nWhat are the best options for staking?\n\nEthereum 2.0\n\nEthereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency. By staking Ethereum, you help the system scale and flourish.\n\nTo do it alone you need to have at least 32 ETH, but many exchanges and platforms usually allow people with less than 32 ETH to stake together in staking pools.\n\nAt the moment, Ethereum 1.0 is based on the proof-of-work system and so cannot be staked. Ethereum 2.0 hasn\u2019t been launched to the mass market yet, though it is possible to stake it on Binance if you\u2019re willing to lock up your coins until the launch of 2.0.\n\nThe APY is around 5%.\n\n(N.B. Do not confuse staking pools with liquidity pools \u2013 as that is another crypto concept \u2013 see above introduction)\n\nTezos (XTZ)\n\nTezos was created in 2018 and is one of the more popular options for staking. At the time, Tezos received over $230 million in investment.\n\nTezos uses a version of PoS called liquid proof-of-stake (LPoS).\n\nIn the Tezos network, staking is called \u2018baking\u2019. People who bake are rewarded with the XTZ coin. Any malicious activity can result in your stake being confiscated.\n\nTo become a baker, you usually need to hold 8,000 XTZ coins. However, third party services allow smaller bakers to pool together funds to share in the rewards of baking.\n\nVarious exchanges allow baking for a retail investor, such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nThe annual percentage yield (APY) on XTZ is around 5-6%.\n\nAlgorand (ALGO)\n\nThe aim of the Algorand protocol is to facilitate low-cost cross-border payments. It\u2019s another popular option with many cryptocurrency exchanges offering the ability to stake for smaller amounts.\n\nThe APY can differ depending on the platform or exchange you use to stake, but it can range from 5-10%.\n\nAs mentioned above, it\u2019s worthwhile looking for exchanges with low fees and high APY offerings to maximise your staking reward.\n\nCosmos (ATOM)\n\nCosmos is an exciting project that aims to create a \u2018network of networks\u2019. Its goal is to allow different blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\nEssentially, the end goal with the Cosmos network is to almost create an internet of blockchains to achieve true decentralisation.\n\nBy staking the ATOM coin you help sustain and grow the Cosmos network, contributing to their decentralised vision.\n\nATOM staking is a popular option offered by many exchanges. The APY can go up to 9.7%, though some exchanges offer an average of around 5%.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nFounded by one of the co-founders of Ethereum, the Cardano network positions itself as a new generation Ethereum.\n\nThe Cardano network is being developed based on peer-reviewed research and aims to be the mainstream network for smart contracts, just like Ethereum.\n\nAt the moment, most of its applications lie in identity management and traceability.\n\nCardano works on a timeframe called an \u2018epoch\u2019, which is five days. It takes three epochs for you to start generating returns by staking ADA.\n\nADA can be traded through popular exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nVeChain (VET)\n\nTaking inspiration from Ethereum, VeChain was founded in 2015 to provide a crypto backbone to enterprise across the world.\n\nVeChain applies the distributed ledger technology of cryptocurrencies to supply chain management and business processes in diverse markets and sectors. It is essentially blockchain-as-a-service.\n\nThe network has two currencies, VET and VTHO. VET is the public facing currency that is used as a store of value whereas VTHO is needed to interact with the VeChain network and pay fees if you want to use the blockchain.\n\nVET is available to purchase through Binance. Staking VET will reward you with around 3% APY.\n\nThere has been a noticeable downward trend in staking rewards, so take that into account.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIn 2017, they launched an initial coin offering (ICO) for their own coin, Binance Coin.\n\nBNB can be used in certain ecosystems and websites which accept BNB, such as games and communities based on the Binance smart chain or companies willing to accept BNB as payment.\n\nMost importantly, BNB is used within the Binance crypto exchange itself by millions of users to pay fees and donate on Binance charity.\n\nBinance have established an incentive to use BNB for all Binance users because if you pay for trading and transaction fees using BNB, you receive a discount compared to paying with cash.\n\nBNB can be staked on Binance itself, with the APY ranging anywhere from 8% to 27% based on the duration and amount held.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nCoinbase and Binance are the most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges and are used by millions of people across the world.

At the time, Tezos received over $230 million in investment.\n\nTezos uses a version of PoS called liquid proof-of-stake (LPoS).\n\nIn the Tezos network, staking is called \u2018baking\u2019. People who bake are rewarded with the XTZ coin. Any malicious activity can result in your stake being confiscated.\n\nTo become a baker, you usually need to hold 8,000 XTZ coins. However, third party services allow smaller bakers to pool together funds to share in the rewards of baking.\n\nVarious exchanges allow baking for a retail investor, such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nThe annual percentage yield (APY) on XTZ is around 5-6%.\n\nAlgorand (ALGO)\n\nThe aim of the Algorand protocol is to facilitate low-cost cross-border payments. It\u2019s another popular option with many cryptocurrency exchanges offering the ability to stake for smaller amounts.\n\nThe APY can differ depending on the platform or exchange you use to stake, but it can range from 5-10%.\n\nAs mentioned above, it\u2019s worthwhile looking for exchanges with low fees and high APY offerings to maximise your staking reward.\n\nCosmos (ATOM)\n\nCosmos is an exciting project that aims to create a \u2018network of networks\u2019. Its goal is to allow different blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\nEssentially, the end goal with the Cosmos network is to almost create an internet of blockchains to achieve true decentralisation.\n\nBy staking the ATOM coin you help sustain and grow the Cosmos network, contributing to their decentralised vision.\n\nATOM staking is a popular option offered by many exchanges. The APY can go up to 9.7%, though some exchanges offer an average of around 5%.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nFounded by one of the co-founders of Ethereum, the Cardano network positions itself as a new generation Ethereum.\n\nThe Cardano network is being developed based on peer-reviewed research and aims to be the mainstream network for smart contracts, just like Ethereum.\n\nAt the moment, most of its applications lie in identity management and traceability.\n\nCardano works on a timeframe called an \u2018epoch\u2019, which is five days. It takes three epochs for you to start generating returns by staking ADA.\n\nADA can be traded through popular exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nVeChain (VET)\n\nTaking inspiration from Ethereum, VeChain was founded in 2015 to provide a crypto backbone to enterprise across the world.\n\nVeChain applies the distributed ledger technology of cryptocurrencies to supply chain management and business processes in diverse markets and sectors. It is essentially blockchain-as-a-service.\n\nThe network has two currencies, VET and VTHO. VET is the public facing currency that is used as a store of value whereas VTHO is needed to interact with the VeChain network and pay fees if you want to use the blockchain.\n\nVET is available to purchase through Binance. Staking VET will reward you with around 3% APY.\n\nThere has been a noticeable downward trend in staking rewards, so take that into account.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIn 2017, they launched an initial coin offering (ICO) for their own coin, Binance Coin.\n\nBNB can be used in certain ecosystems and websites which accept BNB, such as games and communities based on the Binance smart chain or companies willing to accept BNB as payment.\n\nMost importantly, BNB is used within the Binance crypto exchange itself by millions of users to pay fees and donate on Binance charity.\n\nBinance have established an incentive to use BNB for all Binance users because if you pay for trading and transaction fees using BNB, you receive a discount compared to paying with cash.\n\nBNB can be staked on Binance itself, with the APY ranging anywhere from 8% to 27% based on the duration and amount held.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nCoinbase and Binance are the most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges and are used by millions of people across the world.
