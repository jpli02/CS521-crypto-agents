        "content": "Despite slight gains for investors in the past three months, BNB could face selling pressure.\n\nTraders have resolved to overlooking the opening of BNB contracts.\n\nBinance Coin [BNB], the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange, may have done well to remain above $300 despite the recent red days of the market. However, the resilience shown might not be confirmation that BNB is in a prime position for an uptick.\n\nRead Binance Coin\u2019s [BNB] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAccording to Santiment, the coin\u2019s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has been increasing since 20 May. At press time, the metric was 7.211%.\n\nBNB lacking attention?\n\nOften viewed as a macro-oscillator, the MVRV ratio shows the ratio between the current price of an asset and the average price acquired while pointing out how overvalued or undervalued the asset is.\n\nWhen the ratio increases, it means that investors are showing a willingness to sell, depending on the market cycle. Since this was the case with BNB, the increase had the potential to propel a further drop in value.\n\nAs a result, traders seem to be indifferent about the BNB price action, the funding rate revealed. At the time of writing, the BNB funding rate was 0%. This neutral state explains how longs and shorts were not interested in paying each other to keep their futures or options contracts open.\n\nA further evaluation of the derivatives market activity showed that the Open Interest (OI) has been decreasing around the same period as the MVRV ratio started increasing. The OI measures the amount of money invested in contracts related to a coin.\n\nTherefore, the OI decrease implied that both buyers and sellers were actively closing their positions. If it were to be the other way around, then it would mean that traders were jumping on the BNB price action for potential gains.\n\nNo cause for buzz\n\nWhile the average sentiment toward the coin mildly increased over the last two weeks, it failed to exit the negative zone.\n\nAs of this writing, on-chain data showed that BNB\u2019s weighted sentiment was -1.05. The weighted sentiment considers the positive and negative commentary on social networks.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Binance Coin Profit Calculator\n\nSo, when the metric is above the zero midpoints, it infers that the perception around the asset is mostly positive. However, the stay in the red zone suggests that the broader market was not optimistic about the BNB short-term price action.\n\nAt press time, the ratio was 6.583. Although the value was the highest for all of May, it was still considered low. Hence, market participants made more profits than losses in the month. But it was nowhere near the peak recorded in January."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn an unexpected twist of events, hardware wallet maker Trezor has seen an incredible 900% increase in sales, while rival Ledger suffers a serious setback. The increase in Trezor purchases coincides with a major debate over Ledger\u2019s seed phrase recovery feature.\n\nUsers of Ledger, a top producer of hardware wallets, are concerned about the security of their money in light of the recent controversy surrounding the company. Concerns regarding seed phrase storage and the admittance by Ledger that the software can be pushed to release crucial information have raised red flags in the crypto community. Ledger has put a hold on the feature\u2019s rollout to focus on enhancing transparency and code verifiability in response to these worries. Still, Ledger users appear to have lost faith in the company, which has hurt sales.\n\nOn the other hand, Trezor, a reputable rival in the hardware wallet market, has seen a startling 1000% increase in sales. Trezor has attracted a large following of cryptocurrency fans and investors looking for a safer solution to increase the security of their digital assets. Trezor\u2019s recent sales success has been greatly influenced by its solid reputation for prioritizing customer privacy and security.\n\nThe increase in Trezor sales suggests a rising need for secure storage options among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Investors are becoming increasingly conscious of how crucial it is to protect their digital assets, particularly in light of constant cyber threats and hacking attempts. Trezor\u2019s popularity among users for its top-notch security measures and easy-to-use interface has boosted its sales figures.\n\nAdditionally, the effects of the temporary closure of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange coincided with the most recent spike in Trezor sales. Many traders turned to hardware wallets to escape from FTX\u2019s technical issues to independently secure their assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrezor\u2019s increasing sales and Ledger\u2019s difficulties serve as a reminder of how important security and trust are to the cryptocurrency sector. Users prioritize platforms and products that prioritize the protection of their funds. Hardware wallet producers must uphold the highest levels of security as the market continues to develop if they want to inspire user confidence.\n\nThe rise in Trezor sales and the difficulties Ledger is currently experiencing may have far-reaching effects in the future. Trezor\u2019s success is probably going to push it to the head of the hardware wallet pack, which will raise industry rivalry and spur innovation. Ledger must work hard to repair its reputation and win back its users\u2019 trust.\n\nThe value of secure storage options cannot be overstated as cryptocurrency adoption rises. Hardware wallets are essential for protecting digital assets; thus, users should be careful to choose a reliable provider."

        "title": "Trading strategy on Bitcoin using the ADX - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "A previous article examined a strategy on Ethereum (ETH) based on the calculation of ADX, an indicator whose acronym stands for \u201cAverage Directional Movement Index\u201d and is used to measure the strength of a trend.\n\nIf the indicator tends toward low values then the trend will be almost absent, if the ADX takes high values then the underlying trend will be more significant.\n\nBacktest of the ADX trading system on Bitcoin, MATIC and BNB\n\nSince this trading strategy was providing interesting results on ETH, the decision was made to test the same logic also on other cryptocurrencies. Specifically, the strategy involved long-only entries, with ADX less than 50 on the highest highs of the last 200 bars (at 15 minutes).\n\nExits were on the lowest lows of the last 200 bars, as well as possibly at stop loss (5% of the position\u2019s value), or after a maximum of 5 days in the market.\n\nFigure 1. Example Entry and Exit Pattern on MATIC\n\nHow might this logic work on other cryptocurrencies?\n\nTesting the trading system on Bitcoin (BTC), MATIC, and BNB shows from the outset some continuity from the results obtained on ETH.\n\nWe chose to use ADX values below 45 (slightly more stringent than the ETH strategy) for these crypto assets because it provides the best results (Figures 2-3-4) in overall terms. The profit goes down as the ADX values go down, but the average trade goes up (except on BNB on which other ADX values seem to work), consequently the drawdown goes down as the ADX filter becomes more stringent.\n\nThis is certainly an indication of the good filtering job done by the indicator, as the quality of the average trade has increased.\n\nThe position is always fixed and is equivalent to $10,000 in monetary value. The average trades that are obtained are undoubtedly capacious enough to trade in the real market.\n\nFigure 2. BTC trading system optimization based on ADX\n\nFigure 3. MATIC trading system optimization based on ADX\n\nFigure 4. BNB trading system optimization based on ADX\n\nIn the next figures (5-6-7), it can be seen that the individual curves are also appreciable. ADX seems to be able to provide interesting results even in younger and newer markets such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nFigure 5. Equity Line trading system BTC based on the ADX\n\nFigure 6. Equity Line trading system MATIC based on the ADX\n\nFigure 7. Equity Line trading system BNB based on the ADX\n\nAlso interesting to see is the comparison between the simple buy&hold of these products and the strategy just used.\n\nFigure 8. Buy&Hold on BTC\n\nFigure 9. Buy&Hold on MATIC\n\nFigure 10. Buy&Hold on BNB\n\nConclusions on the ADX trading system on Bitcoin, MATIC, and BNB\n\nWhat immediately jumps out is that in the most recent part of the backtest, or more generally in the last year and a half, the strategy has performed better than the simple buy&hold of the instrument.\n\nIn fact, while the overall profit of the strategy is lower than that of the buy&hold, there are no sharp drawdowns like those recorded by the markets between the beginning of 2022 and the end of the same year.\n\nThe automated strategy, with the help of ADX, was able to skim those market phases where it was not convenient to enter and take long positions.\n\nEven on Bitcoin \u2013 a market that is certainly more prone to the development of automatic strategies since it is the oldest among crypto assets \u2013 the equity peaks of this strategy have recently been reached, in the face of the conspicuous rebound that the same market made in the early months of 2023.\n\nIn this case as well, the automated strategy was able on the one hand to contain risk and on the other hand to update historical highs more frequently than the classic buy-and-hold approach.\n\nUntil next time!\n\nAndrea Unger"

        "title": "Short shrift for short stays: Labor MPs plot Airbnb crackdown to tackle rental crisis - The Age",
        "content": "In Mornington, the April vacancy was 2.2 per cent. That\u2019s higher than in other parts of Victoria, but still makes it difficult to find a rental. Loading The Labor MPs will raise the potential housing reforms at future caucus meetings in the hope they will be adopted by cabinet. \u201cI think now\u2019s the time to be bold,\u201d one Labor MP said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the political capital that comes from our resounding success last year. It\u2019s not going to be easy. But it\u2019s the right thing.\n\n\u201cThere have been conversations among Labor MPs about housing reform. All of these things are on the table. It\u2019ll be up to cabinet to sift through all of this and make decisions.\u201d Loading Another Labor MP said: \u201cIf you look at where our marginals are, there\u2019s a real interest in housing because too much is taken up by short-stay rentals. It\u2019s squeezing the teacher-nurse cohort.\u201d Any reform would be about changing how Airbnb properties were treated at the state or local government level, the MP said. \u201cIt might not be a state government tax. It might be a local government deeming [that] they\u2019re commercial properties for the purpose of rates, for example.\u201d\n\nThere were almost 5000 homes for rent on Airbnb along the Mornington Peninsula in February, up from about 4000 last year, according to data collection website insideairbnb.com. Airbnb properties are booked for just 52 days a year on average, according to the same platform. It comes as Victorian renters endure an extremely tight and expensive rental market. Vacancy rates reached a record low of 0.8 per cent in Melbourne early this year. The NSW government introduced short-stay regulations in November 2021, limiting the time a property can be on the market to 180 days a year. The Victorian Greens have previously called on the Andrews government to introduce a 90-day cap. In Italy and Scotland, legislators have considered tourism levies they say will be used to funnel money back into local communities. Mornington Peninsula Shire and other Victorian councils have already introduced annual registration fees and moved to clamp down on Airbnb noise complaints.\n\nMornington Peninsula Mayor Steve Holland said he favoured reforms that would grant councils more autonomy. \u201cLocal government should have the power to regulate and permit short-stay rentals in line with the expectations of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cCouncils are the best place to deal with this issue. Some councils have less than 500 Airbnbs. We\u2019ve got an estimated 5500.\u201d Mornington Peninsula Shire does not charge residential and commercial properties different rates. But other councils that have a large number of Airbnb listings, such as the City of Melbourne, do. Airbnb Australia and New Zealand\u2019s head of public policy Michael Crosby said the company was not opposed to a statewide tourism levy and this was, in fact, his preferred approach because it created consistency compared with a council-by-council approach.\n\n\u201cWe believe tourism levies are a fair and sustainable way to raise revenue for local communities, especially in areas of high tourism, as they broaden the revenue base without imposing an additional burden on local ratepayers or businesses,\u201d he said. Loading Grattan Institute economist Brendan Coates said it was time for the Andrews government to encourage owners of short-stay rentals to return those properties to the long-term rental market. \u201cThat would come with a cost, because fewer Airbnbs would mean less regional tourism, and therefore fewer regional jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be better than seeing families across Victoria living in caravan parks, tents and cars.\u201d Alphington mother of two Kasia D\u2019Agnolo said she wouldn\u2019t be placing her and her husband\u2019s Sorrento Airbnb on the long-term rental market even if additional state government regulations were put in place.\n\n\u201cOur primary reason for having this beach house is to enjoy it as a family,\u201d she said. Loading \u201cI don\u2019t want to get stung any more. But it\u2019ll all get negatively geared anyway. I think they need to look at where this will make an impact. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget the benefit Airbnb has on regional areas in terms of regional businesses and the affordability of family holidays.\u201d Rye retiree Linda Wimetal said something had to be done to reduce the number of \u201cunsustainable, expensive, part-time dormitories\u201d in her area.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to rent down here except for more than $500 a week. Yet there\u2019s 1600 Airbnbs in Rye alone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is very poor planning. Working families are known to be sleeping in tents on the beach.\u201d The seat of Nepean, which takes in Mornington Peninsula towns including Rye, flipped from Labor to Liberal at last year\u2019s election. Former tennis player Sam Groth holds Nepean with a 6.7 per cent margin. The nearby Labor seats of Bass and Hastings are held by margins of 0.2 and 1.4 per cent, respectively. Coates said when it comes to tackling the rental crisis, the main focus should be on boosting residential development in Melbourne\u2019s inner and middle-ring suburbs. \u201cIn the long term, the only way to keep rents in check is to build more housing. Victoria has not built enough housing to meet the needs of its growing population.\u201d\n\nThe Property Council has an open mind when it comes to regulating short-stay accommodation, but is expected to oppose any move to cap rent increases. Landlords are already limited to raising rent once a year, but there is no limit to that increase. Loading Asked about the potential reforms, a Victorian government spokeswoman acknowledged the state did not have enough housing to meet demand. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard on a package of reforms \u2013 including rental reforms \u2013 that will come later in the year, and we will have more to say in due course,\u201d she said late Saturday. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Andrews stressed that additional housing reforms were still a few months away."
