        "title": "SEC alleges 12 crypto assets are securities - TechCrunch",
        "content": "On Monday, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao, as well as BAM Trading and BAM Management, for lying to regulators about operations, among other charges.\n\nWhile the suit raised eyebrows across the industry, what stood out to TechCrunch+ was the agency\u2019s direct stance on a handful of crypto assets being securities. That\u2019s something crypto community members have argued against in the past.\n\nThe total filing was 136 pages long and carried a lot of information. So we dove deep into the securities section of the document ourselves to get an understanding of what cryptocurrencies the SEC views as securities and what this could mean for the ecosystem.\n\nIn the filing, the SEC alleges that Binance and BAM Trading violated federal securities laws by \u201cillegally conducting unregistered offers and sales of securities to U.S. investors\u201d through BNB, BUSD, its \u201cBNB Vault\u201d program and \u201cSimple Earn\u201d program, as well as BAM Trading\u2019s staking-as-a-service program.\n\nSince its inception, BNB and BUSD has \u201cbeen offered and sold as an investment contract and, therefore, as a security,\u201d the filing stated. This stance of crypto assets and programs being offered as an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d is repeated throughout the filing for each crypto asset mentioned as the de facto argument for what qualifies as securities.\n\nAside from Binance-related tokens, the crypto assets traded on Binance.com and Binance.US include assets that were \u201coffered and sold as securities,\u201d like Solana\u2019s SOL, Cardano\u2019s ADA, Polygon\u2019s MATIC, Filecoin\u2019s FIL, Cosmos\u2019 ATOM, Sandbox\u2019s SAND, Decentraland\u2019s MANA, Algorand\u2019s ALGO, Axie Infinity\u2019s AXS and Coti\u2019s COTI tokens. What made the agency highlight these cryptocurrencies, and not the hundreds of others tradable assets on the exchange, is unclear.\n\nRegardless, the SEC filing allocated 53 pages worth of context, diving into each of the 12 crypto assets mentioned above.\n\nAs for its BNB Vault and Simple Earn programs, from October 2019 to October 2022, anywhere from 3,200 to 16,500 U.S. investors participated in its Simple Earn investment plan, and over 1,400 investors participated in the BNB Vault program, according to the filing.\n\nThis highlights the fact that the SEC has, once again, taken the stance that most cryptocurrencies (aside from Bitcoin) are securities.\n\nPer the March CFTC\u2019s filing against Binance, the regulator said certain digital assets, including bitcoin, ether, litecoin and \u201cat least two fiat-backed stablecoins,\u201d tether and the Binance USD, \u201cas well as other virtual currencies as alleged herein, are \u2018commodities.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo the seesaw game of figuring out which crypto assets are securities or commodities stands. But cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly defined as securities as the SEC continues to regulate by enforcement.\n\n\u201cSimilar to previous cases, the SEC concludes on its own that assets listed on Binance are securities in the same way the CFTC has concluded that similar assets are commodities,\u201d Jeffrey Blockinger, chief counsel at decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol, told TechCrunch+.\n\nAs the SEC continues to double down on its stance, investors and platforms alike should consider adjusting their personal beliefs to align with the agencies, considering the crackdown on these tokens is going to continue to happen \u2014 whether they like it or not.\n\n\u201cI expect this competitive regulatory battle to ultimately be decided by the courts, which will be a tremendous waste of resources for both the agencies and the industry,\u201d Blockinger said. \u201cIt is disappointing to see such a dramatic breakdown in U.S. regulation which has historically been the regulatory leader of the world.\u201d\n\nThe existing crypto financial services ecosystem is being replaced by one regulated under the federal securities laws, Aaron Kaplan, co-CEO and co-founder of Prometheum Inc., told TechCrunch+. For reference, Prometheum is the parent company behind a SEC and FINRA-registered digital asset securities trading platform.\n\nThe current enforcement action against Binance is \u201canother step in the transition of crypto trading and custody to properly licensed entities under the federal securities laws,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cDigital assets are regulated financial instruments and often virtual currency exchanges [trying] to evade rules and regulations by either choosing lax jurisdictions from which to base their business or operating under improper licenses that did not and do not properly protect their customers.\u201d"

They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged down 0.17% to 3,295.91 in the 24 hours to 9:20 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance \u201chasn\u2019t had an impact on NFTs yet, but it likely will,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, said on Tuesday. \u201cIt has already impacted crypto, and usually NFTs lag behind just a bit.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. overnight, Apple Inc. unveiled its highly-anticipated mixed-reality headset Vision Pro. While priced at a hefty US$3,499, the headset has got the NFT industry excited about its potential application in metaverse developments.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s headset is really all the NFT spaces was talking about today and rightfully so,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cReally, it\u2019s the single most important thing to happen to NFTs since CryptoPunks, even though Apple didn\u2019t mention NFTs or the metaverse once in their reveal of the Vision Pro.\u201d\n\nS\u00e9bastien Borget, co-founder and chief operating officer of decentralized gaming giant The Sandbox, said in a Tuesday interview with Forkast that Apple\u2019s headset is \u201copening a big field of opportunity\u201d for metaverse developments.\n\n\u201cThis has the highest chance of becoming a game changer versus everything we\u2019ve seen so far over the past five years in this field \u2026 allowing people to interact with their virtual assets in the physical world.\u201d\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 5.64% over the last 24 hours to US$25.75 million, and gained 90.84% in the past week. Sales on the Bitcoin network climbed 4.17% to US$3.16 million, but recorded a 11.87% weekly decline.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Azuki remained the two most-sold Ethereum collections. BAYC had the biggest sales in the past 24 hours of US$7.26 million, followed by Azuki\u2019s US$2.65 million.\n\nDMarket, a Mythos blockchain-based collection of gaming NFTs, was the third most-sold collection over the past 24 hours with an 11.49% rise in sales to US$1.52 million.\n\nCoinbase shares hit by Binance\n\nImage: Coinbase\n\nShares of Coinbase, the largest crypto trading platform in the U.S., dropped 9.05% on Monday following the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance. Shares of MicroStrategy, the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, fell 8.53%.\n\nU.S. stock futures also moved marginally lower as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.05%, S&P 500 futures fell 0.04%. Nasdaq Futures fell 0.09%.\n\nCoinbase has its own legal battle with the SEC. In March, the SEC alleged Coinbase violated investor protection laws and threatened enforcement action against the exchange. Coinbase argued back in April that the SEC\u2019s move appeared to be undermining its own role as the monitor of companies registering to sell shares to the public.\n\nCoinbase has also requested a court to compel the SEC to publicly respond to the exchange\u2019s July 2022 petition asking for clearer crypto regulation guidelines.\n\nOn the regulation front, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, tweeted on Monday that he will testify on Tuesday before the House Committee on Agriculture on the need for clear crypto rules and on the Digital Asset Market Structure discussion draft released Friday.\n\n\u201cThe US is falling behind,\u201d Grewal tweeted. \u201cWe cannot afford to ignore crypto while other markets take advantage of our absence, developing rules and regulations that enable the industry to thrive and risk sending jobs, investment, and technological leadership overseas.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

BAYC had the biggest sales in the past 24 hours of US$7.26 million, followed by Azuki\u2019s US$2.65 million.\n\nDMarket, a Mythos blockchain-based collection of gaming NFTs, was the third most-sold collection over the past 24 hours with an 11.49% rise in sales to US$1.52 million.\n\nCoinbase shares hit by Binance\n\nImage: Coinbase\n\nShares of Coinbase, the largest crypto trading platform in the U.S., dropped 9.05% on Monday following the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance. Shares of MicroStrategy, the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, fell 8.53%.\n\nU.S. stock futures also moved marginally lower as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.05%, S&P 500 futures fell 0.04%. Nasdaq Futures fell 0.09%.\n\nCoinbase has its own legal battle with the SEC. In March, the SEC alleged Coinbase violated investor protection laws and threatened enforcement action against the exchange. Coinbase argued back in April that the SEC\u2019s move appeared to be undermining its own role as the monitor of companies registering to sell shares to the public.\n\nCoinbase has also requested a court to compel the SEC to publicly respond to the exchange\u2019s July 2022 petition asking for clearer crypto regulation guidelines.\n\nOn the regulation front, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, tweeted on Monday that he will testify on Tuesday before the House Committee on Agriculture on the need for clear crypto rules and on the Digital Asset Market Structure discussion draft released Friday.\n\n\u201cThe US is falling behind,\u201d Grewal tweeted. \u201cWe cannot afford to ignore crypto while other markets take advantage of our absence, developing rules and regulations that enable the industry to thrive and risk sending jobs, investment, and technological leadership overseas.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"
