        "title": "20 Best Tiny House Rentals on Airbnb and Beyond - Architectural Digest",
        "content": "There are plenty of fantastic reasons to consider tiny house rentals for your next vacation. Perhaps most significantly, renting a micro lodge can make an already exciting getaway feel even more adventurous\u2014simply because it\u2019s something different. With innovative design and unique decor that maximizes even the smallest of spaces, tiny home rentals are a travel trend AD can\u2019t help but get behind. What they lack in square footage they often make up for in environmental conservation, since they require little heat and electricity (and many are made from recycled materials). Plus, because of their size, they are usually situated in areas where houses otherwise can\u2019t be built, like remote forests or beaches.\n\nWhether you want to stray from your usual vacation rental just for fun or you\u2019re interested in purchasing a tiny home of your own one day, here are 15 amazing tiny houses across the country to consider. From an out-of-the-way cabin in North Carolina to a stylish pad in Atlanta, these tiny-house rentals are at the top of our must-visit list."

Users will be able to easily interact with their favorite dApps, smart contracts and other resources on BNB Chain, using human-readable domain names as opposed to long, complex addresses.\n\nThe move is a major step forward, reducing the risk of error for users who would most likely mistype a complex hexadecimal address.\n\nWhat is SPACE ID\n\nSPACE ID is building a universal name service network that seamlessly connects people, information, assets, and applications across blockchains. It\u2019s chain-agnostic, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and open-sourced.\n\nFind more information about SPACE ID here:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Medium | Discord"

Following the collapse of competitor FTX, many investors have been pulling their crypto out of the exchange in recent weeks.\n\nDespite CEO Changpeng Zhao's statement that the situation has stabilized, outflows are still ongoing, with a net $360 million being withdrawn on Friday according to crypto data firm Defillama.\n\nIn fact, data from a separate crypto firm, Nansen, revealed that Binance had lost $3 billion worth of assets over the previous week, accounting for 4% of the firm's total at the time. An investigation by Forbes showed that the actual figure was 15% of the company's assets since a tweet by Zhao which downplayed the Nansen report withdrawals.\n\nFurthermore, nearly a quarter of Binance assets have left the exchange in under two months. Trust in the exchange can be seen through the performances of Binance Coin (BNB) and Binance USD (BUSD) as they have both dropped in value.\n\nBNB lost 29% of its value in the past two months, and Forbes estimates that leaves about 29 million of the tokens at Binance, 51% less than the number the exchange reported on November 10.\n\nFurthermore, the number of BUSD stablecoins at the firm sank by 40%. The net assets dropped by 24% since November, and the investors in well-known tokens like matic, ape, and gala have reduced their assets at the exchange by 40-50%.\n\nAlthough it still holds the title of the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, Binance has not been untouched by the overall decline in digital assets, especially the value of BNB token which decreased 37% in the past 12 months."

        "content": "HANNIBAL, Mo. \u2014 As construction is well underway on the Friendship Brewery, the founders of the brewery hope to open the doors by the upcoming tourist season.\n\nThe Friendship Brewery will be located at 422 N. Main in Hannibal, which previously housed the Mark Twain Brewing Company. Friendship Brewery took ownership of the building last May after the Mark Twain Brewery closed.\n\nThe owners\u2019 primary location is Friendship Brewing Company in Wentzville, Mo.\n\nBrian Nolan, one of the founders of the Friendship Brewery said timing is hard to predict and he can\u2019t give a hard date yet. Although renovations are going well, there are always factors with materials and supply chain issues, and other hiccups along the way.\n\n\u201cWe are pushing pretty hard to be ready for this tourist season and we will keep working on the building even after that,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cOur goal is to be open by the beginning of summer so that we can be active with the many festivals and the cruise ships that are coming in now and just the tourism.\u201d\n\nNolan and his partner David Brewer, are currently focusing on the front of the building in order to open up, which is where the entrance will be rather than the around the side of the building where it once was. They will also be creating a beer garden area for outdoor dining near Main Street.\n\nA new feature for the property will be two bed and breakfast rooms for overnight guests.\n\nThe menu is still under construction and Nolan said that not every location will be the same.\n\n\u201cThere will be beer styles available every location but also every location will also have beer styles that are unique to that property,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to treat every property differently in regards to the menu. We don\u2019t want to be corporate with the same menu everywhere you go; we want it to reflect that location. \u201c\n\nThe Hannibal location wasn\u2019t a planned expendature but when it came up for auction, Nolan said he and Brewer liked the downtown location and saw a lot of potential in the building so they took a leap. They hired Bleigh Construction of Hannibal, and Nolan said they are happy with the work.\n\nNolan and Brewer are looking forward to doing business in downtown Hannibal and said they have received a warm welcome from residents and other business owners in the area."

        "title": "Six-part Channel 4 series The World's Most Secret Hotels will explore the most exclusive getaways - Daily Mail",
        "content": "Imagine a hotel so deep in the jungle that you have to ride a zipwire 400 metres over the forest canopy to get there. Or a hotel where you sleep with the fish in an underwater room. Or how about a candlelit stay in a cave once occupied by Stone Age people? If you want a New Year break with a difference, tune in to The World\u2019s Most Secret Hotels on Channel 4, a six-part journey to some of the most remote holiday destinations on the planet.\n\nThe most secret are designed to immerse their guests in nature \u2013 literally. Sweden\u2019s Utter Inn looks like a tiny cottage floating on Lake M\u00e4laren, about 60 miles from Stockholm, but it\u2019s actually a miniscule hotel with a bedroom beneath the waves. Created by artist Mikael Genberg, it\u2019s only accessible by boat and has just two rooms \u2013 a kitchen-bathroom at sea level and, below, a sunken bedroom with windows that look out into the underwater world.\n\nGenberg was initially told his idea was impossible. \u2018Even people in the submarine industry said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have big problems with condensation and air,\u201d\u2019 he says. \u2018But when somebody says, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that\u201d, I think, \u201cWhy not?\u201d, so I worked with shipbuilders and some very clever people.\n\n\u2018The fish love the place,\u2019 he adds. \u2018Pike and perch come up to the windows because the lights are on and people are moving. It\u2019s like a reverse aquarium.\u2019\n\nFor aviation fans who don\u2019t fancy the turbulence, JumboStay Hotel (pictured) at Stockholm's Arlanda Airport has a cockpit suite\n\nAt Cambodia\u2019s Shinta Mani Wild it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 guests stay way above ground in one of 15 secluded tents on stilts in a jungle that is home to pangolins and sun bears. And it all starts with a hair-raising experience \u2013 by climbing a seven-storey tower, then whooshing down to reception harnessed to a zipwire.\n\nIt\u2019s the brainchild of American architect Bill Bensley. \u2018The way you enter a property is very, very important,\u2019 he says. \u2018Rocking up in a car and going through some glass doors ain\u2019t going to happen in a Bensley Hotel. People arrive pumped up, because the majority have never done a zipwire before.\u2019\n\nShinta Mani Wild is also a hotel with a purpose. The site was due to be turned into a titanium mine before Bensley acquired it, and he now uses the profits (a three-night stay for two costs \u00a36,500) to hire forest rangers who look for illegal poachers and loggers \u2013 and guests can accompany them on their anti-poaching missions.\n\nThe cockpit room at the Jumbo Stay (Jumbohostel) in Sweden, which is a hostel that is a converted Boeing 747 airline\n\nAt the Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort in Finnish Lapland, guests can marvel at the Northern Lights from the comfort of their beds in one of the weather resistant igloos\n\nA trip back in time is on offer at the Sextantio Le Grotte della Civita Hotel in the town of Matera in southern Italy. Its ancient cave dwellings are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, but mostly deserted until entrepreneur Daniele Kihlgren transformed them into a luxury hotel.\n\nA deconsecrated church cave lit only by candles is the restaurant, and rooms are characterised by monastic simplicity with no TVs, telephones or minibars. \u2018In Italy we preserve classical architecture, but I wanted to preserve one of the places where ordinary people lived,\u2019 says Kihlgren. \u2018These caves have a unique identity.\u2019\n\nSome of the hotels offer an adventure that\u2019s more out-of-this-world. At the Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort in Finnish Lapland, guests can marvel at the Northern Lights from the comfort of their beds when staying in one of its 65 weather-resistant glass igloos complete with 360\u00b0 views.\n\nSweden\u2019s Utter Inn looks like a tiny cottage floating on Lake M\u00e4laren, about 60 miles from Stockholm, but it\u2019s actually a miniscule hotel with a bedroom beneath the waves\n\nThousands of miles south, in Jordan\u2019s desert, residents at the Wadi Rum Bubble Luxotel can stay in a futuristic plastic \u2018bubble\u2019 with a transparent roof for gazing up at the star-strewn sky. The desert here is just as otherworldly: The Martian and Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker were filmed nearby.\n\nFor aviation fans who don\u2019t fancy the turbulence, JumboStay Hotel offers a singular experience. It\u2019s a decommissioned Boeing 747 jumbo jet parked on the tarmac at Stockholm\u2019s Arlanda Airport. And its most remarkable feature? The cockpit suite that still has the original control panel. \u2018A lot of pilots have come with their kids to teach them how to fly a 747,\u2019 says manager Ameer Junejo.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a unique holiday this year, The World\u2019s Most Secret Hotels should provide plenty of inspiration.\n\nThe World\u2019s Most Secret Hotels, later this month, Channel 4.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nThe inn you'll want to stay in over and over again!
