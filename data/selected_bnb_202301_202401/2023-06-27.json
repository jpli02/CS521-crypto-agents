Despite this, there\u2019s an ongoing debate in the Hong Kong community about the index\u2019s actual reference value.\n\nThis debate arises from the inclusion of platform tokens, privacy tokens, and numerous tokens listed as securities by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the index.\n\nThe Hong Kong SFC mandates that retail-tradable tokens be included in at least two indices. Although this index is non-governmental, its judging criteria are straightforward, focusing on the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\n\nAlso Read: HSBC Hong Kong Offers Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF to Clients\n\nWith this bold initiative, HKVAC seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the market, even if its value as a reference continues to be debated among local experts."
