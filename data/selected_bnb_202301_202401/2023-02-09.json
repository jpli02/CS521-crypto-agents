        "content": "The couple asked each other about Moneybagg's baby mamas, the first time they said the L word, and whether his kids like her.\n\nAri Fletcher and Moneybagg Yo recently asked each other some tough questions during a cooking video the two recorded together. While the couple went through their fair share of hiccups in their history, it was a fun and charming clip. In fact, it seems they're more committed than ever, as these questions were pretty in-depth. Here are Ari's inquiries: \"Did you really snatch my wig off when we was outside the club in Miami? Do your kids like me? In your new song, you was like 'F**k on my h*e, f**k on my b***h.' Who were you talking about? Do your baby mamas like me?\"\n\nATLANTA, GA - SEPTEMBER 06: Moneybagg Yo and Ariana Fletcher attend Moneybagg Yo and Ari Host Medusa at Medusa on September 6, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.(Photo by Prince Williams/Wireimage)\n\nMoreover, the Memphis rapper had his own set of questions as they cooked what seemed to be some sort of chicken recipe. \"Do you remember the first time you said you loved me, and when I told you? You ain't let me hit until, like Thanksgiving. You made me wait.\" Much to be thankful for, indeed. Unfortunately, though, the clip omits each partner's answers, but Fletcher said the full video will come out soon. After all, Ari has a channel where she posts cooking vids often. In fact, we already knew this video was coming thanks to her blasting an Airbnb owner for promoting it.\n\nFurthermore, Fletcher and Moneybagg filmed the cooking video in an Airbnb, whose owner posted pictures of the couple as they filmed. In fact, it was all to promote the property. \u201cIf I payed for a air bnb like a regular normal customer, why would you post pictures of me inside your air bnb telling people we was there,\u201d Ari wrote on Twitter. \u201cThat\u2019s so unprofessional and I was working on something private. I haven\u2019t been at a air bnb in years and this why cause that s**t ghetto!!!\u201d"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe cross-remittance blockchain is the only layer-1 protocol in the committee.\n\nOthers joining the platform include Uniswap Labs and CoinFund.\n\nThe developer behind cryptocurrency XLM, Stellar Development Foundation (SBF), has been admitted into the Commodity Future Trading Commission\u2019s Global Market Advisory Committee (GMAC), joining traditional financial institutions like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs.\n\nPart of the role that SDF will undertake under the relaunched body includes providing guidance on matters of cross-border remittances and the position of stablecoins in the digital asset space. In the announcement, SDF noted that it was important to enlighten the commission with all the aspects of stablecoins and their use cases, including in humanitarian assistance, for instance, the Stellar Aid Assist. The Chamber of Digital Commerce, Uniswap Labs, and CoinFund are the other firms in the blockchain sector that are now members of GMAC.\n\nSaid Stellar: \u2018\u2018our inclusion in the Committee marks another important moment for blockchain. It further acknowledges that the future of US markets and our industry are connected.\u2019\u2019 The platform is also taking it as an opportunity to contribute towards the establishment of better industry regulations under the outfit. The US regulators have been faulted for not providing clear guidance to the industry.\n\nThe Layer-1 Blockchain Seeks to Collaborate with TradFis\n\nStellar believes that traditional financial institutions can work alongside their blockchain counterparts in a mutually beneficial collaboration \u2013 where one could provide industry stability. In contrast, the other can work on cutting-edge innovations.\n\nThe open-source payment network is the only layer-1 blockchain admitted to GMAC \u2013 an opportunity it vowed to use to bring the perspective of its peers to the regulator\u2019s attention \u2013 including the challenges of working as a base infrastructure for supporting decentralized applications (dApps.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn direct contrast, while CFTC is engaging industry players, the SEC is taking a different stance \u2013 in light of the ongoing legal tussle against Ripple and its executives. The agency sued the blockchain in 2020 for allegedly selling its token XRP as a security. In the matter \u2013 which is expected to be a game-changer \u2013 Ripple\u2019s top executive and defendant Brad Garlinghouse recently expressed optimism that the ruling would come in the year\u2019s first half."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nBinance Coin formed an ascending triangle pattern.\n\nIt faces stiff opposition at the $330 mark, but buying pressure was ticking higher.\n\nBinance Coin [BNB] posted steady gains throughout January 2023 and succeeded in breaking above the $315 level of resistance in early February 2023. This level of resistance has been significant since November 2022. Therefore, a move above it hints at further gains.\n\nRead Binance Coin\u2019s [BNB] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nA recent report highlighted BNB\u2019s positive performance in the market recently, and the fact that the adoption of the exchange token was on the rise. Bitcoin also has a bullish bias. Hence, barring a BTC drop below $22.3k, another move upward could be the way forward for Binance Coin.\n\nBNB is on an uptrend leading into a bullish pattern\n\nOver the past week, BNB has made a series of higher lows. At the same time, it has bumped into the resistance at $330 multiple times but could not break out. In doing so it formed an ascending triangle pattern. Before forming this pattern, Binance Coin had been trending higher.\n\nThis pattern is a bullish continuation pattern, and a breakout is projected to reach at least $348. The next major zone of resistance lies at $351-$360 and is a 12-hour bearish order block.\n\nRecent days of trading showed the RSI to form a series of lower highs, to denote waning bullish momentum. Yet, the OBV has steadily risen higher. The OBV\u2019s uptrend was a strong signal that buyers retained strength in the market.\n\nA daily session close above $330 would be a signal for bulls to look for buying opportunities targeting the $350-$360 area to take profit at.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Binance Coin Profit Calculator\n\nLower timeframe bullish sentiment gathers strength\n\nThis 30-minute chart from Coinalyze shows that the Open Interest has increased in the past couple of days. So, too, has the spot CVD. Both factors highlight bullish sentiment saw an uptick, and buying pressure was gathering strength. The predicted funding rate also rose to show long positions paid the short sellers\u2019 funding.\n\nIt was unclear when exactly a bullish breakout would commence. The evidence at hand shows that a move upward is more likely. Invalidation of this idea would be a drop beneath $321.5, which would flip the lower timeframe market structure to bearish. In this scenario, a retest of the $315 level could see a bullish reaction."

        "title": "6 best cross-chain bridges in 2023 - TechTarget",
        "content": "As the demand for different blockchain-based Web 3.0 technologies continues to grow, so too does the need to enable interoperability. This is something that is enabled with cross-chain bridge services.\n\nBlockchain is a distributed ledger technology that uses cryptography to provide assurance and integrity to data and transactions. Blockchain networks enable many types of services, including secured databases, immutable ledgers, decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are many blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies that use different blockchain technologies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Solana and Arbitrum. Enabling interoperability and exchange across different blockchain networks is an area where cross-chain bridges -- sometimes also referred to as blockchain bridges -- play an increasingly important role.\n\nWhat is a cross-chain bridge? A cross-chain bridge enables an exchange of information, cryptocurrency or NFTs from one blockchain network to another. It enables the flow of data and tokens across what would otherwise be siloed sets of data on different blockchains. With fiat currency there are many established ways for individuals and businesses to exchange money, creating a globally available and interoperable system of financial payments. Those systems include financial institutions, banks and credit cards that handle foreign exchange. In the world of blockchains, a cross-chain bridge serves an analogous purpose. Exchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge, but it is expensive and more time-consuming. Without the use of a cross-chain bridge, users must first convert a cryptocurrency token into a fiat currency, which often involves fees. They then use currency to get the other desired type of cryptocurrency, incurring more fees and taking time. One characteristic of a cross-chain bridge is that it enables users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another without first changing it to fiat currency. Cross-chain bridges aren't limited to just cryptocurrency value transfer either. An effective cross-chain bridge can also enable the transfer of smart contracts and NFTs from one blockchain environment to another. There are several approaches to enabling transfers with a cross-chain bridge. One common approach is using a wrapped token issued by the cross-chain bridge provider platform. With a wrapped token, the value of one token from a specific blockchain network can be encapsulated inside another token. Wrapped tokens are typically based on the ERC-20 technical specification for an Ethereum network. For example, WBTC is a Bitcoin token wrapped with an ERC-20 Ethereum smart contract. Another approach to enabling cross-chain bridge transfers is by using a liquidity pool. With a liquidity pool, a cross-chain bridge provider holds inventory -- or pools -- of various coins where one can be exchanged for another. Cross-chain bridges can also be a lucrative target for hackers. One of the largest attacks occurred in February 2022, when cross-chain bridge platform Wormhole was the victim of an attack in which the threat actor stole 120,000 wrapped Ethereum tokens -- worth an estimated $320 million at the time of the theft. BNB Chain, also known as Binance Smart Chain, was the victim of an attack in October 2022 that resulted in losses estimated at $570 million. Blockchain bridge analysis vendor Chainalyis has estimated that 69% of cryptocurrency funds stolen in 2022 have been attributed to attacks on cross-chain bridges.
