        "content": "Binance introduces Memecoin, a collaboration with 9GAG\u2019s Memeland, to its Launchpool platform, offering users a 30-day staking period across multiple pools.\n\nLeading crypto exchange Binance has introduced Memecoin (MEME) as the newest entrant to its Launchpool, Binance\u2019s exclusive platform where users can stake their tokens and earn new ones. The launch of Memecoin signals a significant collaboration between the exchange and 9GAG\u2019s Web3 venture studio, Memeland.\n\nBinance users will be able to farm MEME tokens by staking Binance Coin (BNB), TrueUSD (TUSD) and FDUSD. The farming initiative kicks off on Oct. 28, and will run for a 30-day period until Nov. 26. Three separate staking pools for BNB, TUSD and FDUSD have been established to facilitate this process.\n\nYou might also like: Gemini sues Genesis for $1.6b GBTC shares ownership\n\nUser Rewards and Real-Time Updates\n\nParticipation in Memecoin\u2019s Launchpool comes with a mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement. The platform will impose an hourly hard cap on MEME tokens that users can stake in each pool. Stakers can anticipate rewards calculated on an hourly basis, and these can be claimed directly to spot accounts at any given time. The annual percentage yield (APY) and overall pool balance for each staking pool will be updated in real-time for user convenience.\n\nBinance has clarified that tokens can be staked in only one pool at a time but noted that users have the flexibility to allocate portions of their holdings to different pools. Any unclaimed rewards and tokens staked will automatically move to the users\u2019 spot accounts when the farming period concludes.\n\nFor those who have committed their BNB in Binance\u2019s BNB Vault, the platform will automatically channel these holdings into the MEME Launchpool, simplifying the process and ensuring daily MEME rewards."

        "content": "How man escaped drugging by \u2018mchele babe\u2019 at Roysambu BnB\n\nA 32-year-old businesswoman who allegedly tried to drug a man at a booked Bed and Breakfast (BnB) apartment in Kasarani, Nairobi, has been charged with stupefying with intent to steal.\n\nLinet Kainyu is accused of administering an unidentified sedative to Jacob Kibet at an apartment on Lumumba Drive in Roysambu on October 23 after allegedly inviting him for beer and amorous fun.\n\nHowever, Kibet discovered the tablet in his drink just before he swallowed it and fled the room before reporting the matter to the apartment management and the police.\n\nMs Kainyu has also been charged with giving false information to the police following her arrest.\n\nShe had told an officer at the police station that her name was Faith Makena, but after her identity card number was added to the digital Occurrence Book (OB), it showed her real name, prompting the police to charge her with giving a false identity.\n\nKibet met Kainyu in a restaurant where she borrowed his phone to call her sister to send money to pay her bills as her phone had been blocked. And Kibet obliged.\n\nHowever, he left the table they were sitting at, moved to another table and had several drinks before leaving.\n\nTwo days later, Kainyu called him and allegedly asked him to meet her for drinks and a romantic encounter, and they met at a restaurant.\n\nThey drank alcohol together for some time and then bought drinks to go before going to the BnB apartment where they were to spend the night on 23 October.\n\nJust before they went to bed, Kibet went to the toilet, leaving his beer on the table, and when he returned, he sipped the beer but felt something on his tongue and spit it out on a handkerchief, only to find it was a tablet of an unknown drug.\n\nHe realised that he had been drugged and informed the building management, who called the police and Ms Kainyu was arrested.\n\nAfter investigations, she was charged at the Makadara Magistrate\u2019s Court and denied the charges before Principal Magistrate Erick Mutunga.\n\nThe tablet, which was recovered on the scene, is being analysed by the government chemist for identification before being used as evidence in the case.\n\nKainyu was released on Sh200,000 bail with no option for cash bail.\n\nThe case will be mentioned on 5 December ahead of trial on 4 April next year."

        "content": "LayerZero recently introduced a bridge token allowing users to move Lido\u2019s $5.5 billion wrapped staked ether (wstETH) token between Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB, and Scroll.\n\nThere was one small problem, however: LayerZero apparently didn\u2019t wait for Lido DAO\u2019s permission before deployment.\n\nLayerZero\u2019s announcement of its omnichain fungible token (OFT) before a DAO vote led some Lido DAO members to feel that the DAO is being strong-armed into approval. While Lido DAO\u2019s power has been a subject of concern lately, one member says the DAO has limited leverage to prevent situations like this one.\n\nLayerZero announced its wstETH standard on Wednesday, and Binance\u2019s BNB chain followed with an announcement of its own.\n\nHart Lambur, a Lido seed investor, said the combined marketing push gave a wrongful sense of Lido\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s the official Lido bridge to go to those chains,\u201d Lambur said, \u201cBut it\u2019s not been approved or okayed by Lido at all. It hasn\u2019t been audited. The security risks haven\u2019t been debated.\u201d\n\nLambur added that Lido DAO has no real recourse other than a potential lawsuit to stop LayerZero from deploying its OFT as Lido-approved.\n\n\u201cThe OFT Standard has been reviewed extensively by independent security and risk managers. All audits are publicly accessible in the technical documentation,\u201d LayerZero Labs said in a statement shared with Blockworks.\n\nAt around the same time that the announcement posts went up, LayerZero made a proposal on Lido DAO\u2019s forum saying it had created the wstETH bridge and would like the product to be formally endorsed by Lido DAO. DAO members expressed immediate skepticism.\n\n\u201cBy unilaterally deploying a bridge and marketing it in an official-seeming way, it feels like you are trying to pressure the DAO into accepting your proposal,\u201d Hasu, the strategy lead at Flashbots, said.\n\nIn a statement posted to Lido\u2019s forum Thursday afternoon, LayerZero said it had asked Stargate, the protocol the wstETH bridge was built on, to remove bridging into Scroll. The statement added that LayerZero has been \u201cengaging with the Lido Core team, community members and independent security teams for several months now on this specific permissionless deployment.\u201d\n\nMultiple forum posters advocated waiting a week before sending the proposal to a Snapshot vote, while others expressed concerns with the security of the OFT.\n\nLambur said that while a worst-case scenario may be unlikely, the real danger lies in LayerZero and BNB Chain advertising an OFT standard not audited by Lido DAO, since the two companies\u2019 marketing could draw significant investment.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say\u2026we have a billion dollars in this standard, and then there\u2019s an exploit and then there\u2019s unlimited minting of this thing that people sell, [causing] pandemonium and panic. Everybody\u2019s selling stETH and trying to withdraw their ETH from Lido,\u201d Lambur said. \u201cThat disaster scenario, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s likely, but it\u2019s not impossible.\u201d\n\nwstETH is the 13th-largest crypto token by market capitalization, according to Blockworks Research.\n\nAround $34.5 million in wstETH changed hands in the 24 hours following LayerZero\u2019s announcement, a negligible change from the day prior.\n\nUpdated Oct. 27, 2023 at 4:51 pm ET: Added statement from LayerZero to clarify comment about audits for the OFT Standard.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
