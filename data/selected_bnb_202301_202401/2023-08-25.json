        "content": "Fri 25 Aug 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nOver the past few days, Binance has been at the center of a whirlwind of events, including the suspension of SEPA transfers. Today, the platform is bidding farewell to over 60 crypto trading pairs. What are the reasons behind this decision?\n\nMore than 60 crypto trading pairs discontinued\n\nIn the wake of the crypto market\u2019s recent downturn, Binance, the global exchange giant, has faced some significant challenges. Unusual events have agitated the platform, including the liquidation scandal and more recently the suspension of SEPA credit transfers for its European customers.\n\nToday, the platform announced that it will be discontinuing over 60 crypto trading pairs. An announcement that no doubt aroused the curiosity of the crypto community. But unlike previous announcements, this one seems to carry a different, less gloomy outlook.\n\nIn a post published on its official blog, Binance explained that the initiative is primarily aimed at making trading more accessible and improving the overall user experience. However, this decision merely adds a new dimension to the clean-up strategy already underway.\n\nAccording to the official statement, as of 1:00 pm (GMT+3) on August 31, the following pairs will no longer be available:\n\nAPI3/BTC, AXS/ETH, BAT/ETH, BEL/BTC, BETA/ETH, BICO/BTC, BOND/BTC, \u00c9CHECS/BTC, CHR/BNB, VILLE/BTC, CTSI/BNB, CVX/BTC, DAR/BTC, DATA/BUSD, DREP/BTC, EGLD/BNB, ENJ/ETH, EOS/BNB, FERME/BTC, FUN/BNB, GLMR/BTC, GMT/ETH, GNS/BTC, HARD/BTC, HFT/BTC, HOOK/BNB, ICP/BNB, ID/BNB, IOST/ETH, IOTA/BNB, IOTA/BTC, IOTA/ETH, JOE/BTC, KAVA/BNB, KLAY/BTC, KNC/BNB, LOKA/BNB, MASK/BNB, MDX/BTC, MLN/BTC, MOB/BTC, MULTI/BTC, NEAR/ETH, ONE/BNB, ONG/BTC, ORN/BTC, PLA/BTC, POLS/BNB, PROM/BTC, PSG/BTC, PUNDIX/ETH, RAY/BNB, RSR/BNB, SCRT/BTC, STX/BNB, SYN/BTC, VOXEL/BTC, WAXP/BTC et WING/BTC.\n\nThis decision seems to stem from the platform\u2019s desire to streamline its offering and focus on the pairs that generate the most activity and interest.\n\nDespite the many challenges currently facing Binance, the platform remains resolutely committed to continuous innovation and improving the user experience. It is precisely this attitude that has enabled it to maintain its dominant position in the global crypto sector.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Image \u00a9 iStock\n\nAir BnB annexes will remain exempt from reforms to council tax.\n\nCouncils have told the government that a second homes premium need not be applied to furnished buildings next to a main residence.\n\nThe LGA said cabins or outhouses converted for Air BnB lets could stay as part of the main property\u2019s tax liability.\n\nThe advice came in a consultation response to new powers in the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill to charge a second homes premium.\n\nAccording to the ONS, there are more than 257,000 hosts operating in the UK. They welcomed a total of 8.4 million guests into their accommodation in 2020.\n\nAlthough in major cities there are concerns that housing is being turned into temporary lettings, in some rural areas they are critical to sustaining poorer communities through tourism.\n\nThe LGA said: \u201cWe agree that the policy objective of the second homes premium is not to change the status of furnished annexes which are being used as part of an adjacent sole or main residence. However, this should not apply to a furnished annex where the main residence is elsewhere.\u201d\n\nCouncils told the government they want certainty so they can properly set charges and also flexibility to reflect local circumstances.\n\nTwo other critical issues are related to empty properties due to either the death of the occupant or building work.\n\nConcerns have been raised by owners that due to labour and material shortages, plus delays in the planning system due to the Covid-19 backlog, people having to move out due to renovations were paying excess.\n\nThe LGA said: \u201cCouncils will want to take account of all the circumstances surrounding major repairs before deciding whether to apply the premium. Some major repairs may be complete before six months and councils should have discretion to apply the premium if that is the case.\u201d\n\nThe council tax submission to Whitehall officials was part of a local funding response that also including feedback on business rates improvement relief draft regulations.\n\nCouncils will have to work with the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) on issues such as checking whether business premises are occupied.\n\nThe LGA commented that councils should, according to Whitehall rules, be given new funding to meet this extra duty: \u201cApplying the new relief will be a new burden for billing authorities including liaising with the VOA on the qualifying works certificate and carrying out the occupation check. The new burdens procedure should apply to this to ensure councils are fully compensated both for the costs of the relief and for any administrative costs incurred.\u201d\n\nWith attention now shifting to the last autumn statement before the general election, there was also a pointed reminder to chancellor Jeremy Hunt to honour a commitment.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe government said in the 2021 Autumn Budget and Spending Review that local authorities would be fully compensated for the business rates measures including the new improvement relief.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to further detailed conversations with the government on how this will be implemented, including any implications for Business Rates Retention. We would expect this relief to be dealt with in the same way as other reliefs granted since 2013/14 are dealt with.\u201d"
