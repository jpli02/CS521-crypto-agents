        "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nBNB could drop to its year-low by the end of Q2.\n\nTechnical back the bearish prognosis.\n\nWestpac Bank discontinued Binance Australia support.\n\nYEREVAN (CoinChapter.com) \u2013 Binance\u2019s in-house token BNB has flatlined for the previous ten days and changed hands at $310 in the Asian Pacific session on May 19. The token also risked a 30% drop in the current quarter due to a bearish technical setup.\n\nBNB is headed to a year\u2019s low\n\nBNB has been trading within a pattern dubbed the \u2018rising wedge.\u2019 The latter entails two converging trendlines and a significant mid-range that take the token price incrementally higher while lowering the price swing, as seen in the chart below.\n\nBinance coin (BNB) price action in a rising wedge. Source: TradingView.com\n\nThe rising wedge is a bearish reversal pattern predicting a drop equal to the wedge\u2019s maximal height after the asset price action breaks below the support. As of May 19, BNB retested the support and did not confirm the rising wedge yet.\n\nHowever, given the declining trading volumes and the bearish MACD oscillator, a further drop in price appears likely. If confirmed, the rising wedge could take Binance coin as low as $208, or 30% below the current value.\n\nBinance Australia discontinues withdrawals.\n\nBinance Australia said on May 18 that it is \u201cunable to facilitate PayID AUD deposits for Binance users\u201d due to a third-party payment service provider \u2013 Westpac Bank\u2019s decision to discontinue support for the crypto exchange.\n\nScott Collary, the group executive of customer services and technology at Westpac, asserted the following:\n\nDigital exchanges have a legitimate role to play in the financial ecosystem. But since the rise of digital currency, we\u2019ve noticed that scammers are increasingly using overseas exchanges. said Collary.\n\nThe bank also asserted that Westpac customers typically discover they have been scammed when the funds have already left the country. At that point, recovering the stolen funds is \u201cextremely difficult.\u201d\n\nBinance Australia informed its clients that the company is \u201cworking hard to find an alternative provider to continue offering AUD deposits and withdrawals to our users.\u201d\n\nFellow Binancians,\n\n\n\nWe regret to inform you that with immediate effect we are unable to facilitate PayID AUD deposits for Binance users due to a decision made by our third party payment service provider.

        "content": "According to the National Association of Black Hotel Owners, Operators and Developers (NABHOOD) there are just nine Black-owned hotels in metro Atlanta. The Atlanta Voice explored a number of Black-owned hotels in order to further highlight the existences in the city\u2019s hospitality space.\n\nThe Hamilton Howell House\n\nBy Isaiah Singleton\n\nIn the heart of Sweet Auburn in Atlanta\u2019s Old Fourth Ward, just around the corner from the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Park and a mile from downtown, the Hamilton Howell House sits with decades of history and events.\n\nThe Hamilton Howell House, a bed and breakfast, was built in 1893 by Alexander Hamilton, Jr., the leading African American contractor, and builder in Atlanta as his family\u2019s home.\n\nThe Howell/Youngblood family acquired the house in 1984, making them only the second family to live in the home since it was built 91 years earlier.\n\nThe rooms of the home have been named for American cultural icons such as Aretha Franklin \u2013 the Queen of Soul, but whose talent spanned all genres of music. Sun Ra \u2013 the avant-garde jazz musician. W.E.B. DuBois \u2013 scholar, author, philosopher, and activist. Elizabeth Catlett \u2013 painter, printmaker, and sculptor. Maya Angelou \u2013 poet, singer, playwright, director, and activist. John Coltrane \u2013 pioneering jazz saxophonist and composer.\n\nThe Hamilton Howell House is located at 102 Howell St NE, Atlanta.\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.hamiltonhowellhouse.com/. For information on how to book a stay at the Hamilton Howell House, visit https://www.hamiltonhowellhouse.com/eventspace.\n\nThe Hyatt Centric Midtown Atlanta\n\nBy Janelle Ward\n\nThe Hyatt Centric in Midtown is a 194-room hotel situated within walking distance of Piedmont Park and Georgia Tech. The property is also located in close proximity to Google\u2019s Atlanta office, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and several local eateries. Public amenities for guests include two fully-functional restaurants, a swimming pool, fitness center and 3,700 square feet of conference space capable of holding up to 200 guests.\n\nRLJ Lodging Trust purchased the property in 2014, converting it to the first Hyatt Centric hotel in the state four years later. The trust was founded by Robert L. Johnson, an entrepreneur perhaps best known for co-founding the pro-Black television network BET in 1980. The REIT is the successor of RLJ Development, a hotel investment platform formed in 2000 by Johnson and his business partner, Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr. RLJ Lodging Trust became publicly traded in 2011, merged with another lodging trust in 2017 and evolved into the real estate investment trust tycoon it\u2019s recognized as today in the following years.\n\nThe trust has since acquired approximately 100 branded hotels located across 23 states and Washington, D.C. RLJ Lodging Trust now owns five hotels in Atlanta, three in Midtown and two in Buckhead.\n\nThree-part formula for achieving real estate success in the hotel business\n\nBy Noah Washington\n\nLess than 2% of hotel proprietors are Black, according to research conducted in 2022 by the National Association of Black Hotel Owners, Operators, and Developers (NABHOOD). Jessica Myers is currently making history in the hotel real estate industry. Myers is a part of an exclusive group of Black and female hotel owners in America. An Atlanta resident and Georgia State University graduate, Myers was introduced to real estate through a career in media sales for CBS while in New York City. Through CBS, Myers was introduced to real estate investment trusts (REITS).\n\n\n\nAfter learning wholesaling, a strategy that involves a wholesaler obtaining a contract on a property with its seller and in turn selling the contract to an investor, Myers learned about how investors were able to borrow money and leverage debt to gain access to capital, and realized that she could do the same.\n\nThis was the beginning of Myers\u2019 reign in real estate in America. Myers later made headlines with her partner, Davonne Reaves, after acquiring Home 2 Suites in El Reno, Oklahoma. The hotel, valued at $8.3 million dollars in early 2021, made the two the youngest Black hotel owners in the industry. At this point, Myers was very comfortable putting deals of this caliber together.\n\n\u201cThat was the entryway into the commercial space, which then led to more partnerships with more people, which then led to two more hotels,\u201d Myers said.\n\nMyers came up with a three-part formula for achieving real estate success, comprising:\n\nOpportunity The knowledge on how to capitalize on said opportunity The capital to execute.\n\n\n\nWhen first meeting with Reaves, the two decided early on who would take on what role, and from there they were able to come together with multiple firms that would ultimately fund their excursion that led them to the acquisition of their first hotel. \u201cWe are currently working on an international resort,\u201d added Myers."
