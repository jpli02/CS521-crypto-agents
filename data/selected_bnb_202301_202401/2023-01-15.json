        "title": "B&Bs may be dwindling in number but they're not a thing of the past - Irish Examiner",
        "content": "Once the beating heart of Ireland\u2019s tourism sector, the traditional B&B is disappearing from many small towns and tourist hotspots.\n\nThere has been an 80% decline in the number of B&Bs in Ireland in the last two decades or so, a seismic decline by any measure.\n\nSelf-catering apartments and standard hotels are a far more visible aspect of Ireland\u2019s tourism sector, as well as the growing presence of short-term accommodation, such as those made available on Airbnb and similar platforms.\n\nBut, despite this gradual change over recent decades, there is some optimism in the sector.\n\nB&B Ireland chief executive Helena Healy believes new short-term letting legislation will breathe new life back into an ailing sector.\n\nMs Healy argued that the \u201cshort-term accommodation legislation\u201d that will be introduced this year has the potential to increase diminishing B&B numbers again.\n\nMs Healy explained that many unregistered B&Bs are not included in official B&B numbers, alluding to a greater decline in numbers in comparison to the reality of the situation.\n\n\u201cI am quite excited about the new legislation as it will create a level playing field for B&Bs in Ireland\u201d, she said.\n\nWith all businesses forced to register, everyone will have to comply with procedures from taxes, etc. There will be no more running of businesses ad-hoc.\n\nOne of the features of this new legislation is the creation of a short-term tourist letting register.\n\nThis register will ensure that properties built for residential accommodation are serving their purpose, with records showing that F\u00e1ilte Ireland estimates a huge 12,000 properties could re-enter the long-term rental market as a result.\n\nAnother main provision of this bill is the introduction of the new Short Term Tourist Letting Register and the requirement of any property owners offering accommodation for a period of \u201cup to and including\u201d 21 days to register with F\u00e1ilte Ireland.\n\nAround the time Joan Carmody started operating Palmgrove House B&B in Listowel, 45% of women stated in the 1991 census that \u2018looking after home/family was their principal economic status. By 2016, that percentage was down to 15%. Picture: Domnick Walsh\n\nThe new legislation allows for a clampdown on those providing accommodation without following guidelines, which can result in a \u20ac300 fixed payment notice.\n\nAmong the most significant aspects of the new bill is that the platforms on which properties are advertised, such as Airbnb and Booking.com, would also be subject to fines of up to \u20ac5,000 per invalid listing, if they do not have valid F\u00e1ilte Ireland numbers.\n\nOver the last 25 years, many rural B&Bs around Ireland have shut their doors for the final time.\n\nMainly operated by couples near retirement age, these homely bed and breakfast businesses offer tourists an inviting, wholesome experience as they explore everything the Emerald Isle has to offer, from home-cooked meals to a friendly welcome.\n\nWith the number of B&Bs falling from 4,000 to 800 in the space of 20-odd years, it is safe to say this sector is in danger of dying out, leaving many visitors short of experiencing the familiar Irish welcome it offers many.\n\nNestled outside of Listowel, overlooking the bustling Tarbert Rd, Palm Grove B&B is a safe haven for those eager to explore the wonders of North Kerry.\n\nLocals Patrick and Joan Carmody have been running the B&B together for the past thirty years.\n\nAfter getting married, Joan began offering her home to those in search of a room during the Listowel Races or various festivals such as the Fleadh Cheoil in the area, before gradually offering a regular B&B service.\n\nPalm Grove opens yearly from May until mid-October.\n\nEver aware of the decline of rural B&Bs, Joan says that the younger generation tends to shy away from the business, fearing the workload it can involve.\n\n\u201cThe fact is it\u2019s too hard work,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAny of mine will tell me \u2018Mom, you work too hard\u2019, and there is a lot of work in it if you\u2019re trying to do it right.\u201d\n\nThe growing network of Irish greenways could boost B&Bs. Pictured last October opening the Listowel to Abbeyfeale section of the North Kerry Greenway are the Cathaoirleach of Listowel Municipal District, councillor Aoife Thornton, Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton, Education Minister Norma Foley, and OPW Minister Patrick O'Donovan. Picture: Valerie O'Sullivan\n\nJoan recalls their effort to balance this workload and their decision to reduce the number of available rooms from four down to three, cutting back on labour.\n\nWith a newfound emphasis on outdoor tourist attractions such as greenways cropping up in local areas, Joan feels this is countering the decline in rural tourism development.\n\nWith the opening of Listowel Greenway last October, Palm Grove has already had some bookings from people intending to travel on the new bike trail.\n\nJoan says that although the business is tough going, it was \u201ca great help\u201d when her children were going to college, offering the family an extra source of income.\n\nI don\u2019t mind working for the summer months. It gives me something to do, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t bother with it this time of year.\n\nPricey hotels have resulted in extra guests choosing the budget-friendly B&B option, which has led to an increase in business for families like the Carmodys.\n\n\u201cYou meet lovely people. I suppose you could say 99% of people are lovely, and I\u2019d have a good bit of repeat business for the races and that,\u201d Joan added.\n\nWhen Covid hit, we saw the last of many rural guesthouses for the final time.\n\nJoan recalled this experience, while managing the B&B saying: \u201cWhen Covid came along I had lots of people booked and of course, it was cancel, cancel, cancel coming in every day.\u201d\n\nJosephine Devitt says life is different now to when she started out in 2005: 'Back then it was a handy way of earning extra cash, helping to put their child through college. Fewer women are staying in the home so that role is gone.' Picture: Denis Minihane\n\nClosing their doors for two years, although difficult, allowed the pair to indulge in the beautiful summer granted to them, something they were unable to enjoy to its full extent whilst working.\n\nUpon opening back up, they noticed an increase in business in comparison to previous years, with many people developing a newfound love for the country and all it has to offer.\n\nThe increased popularity of staycations resulted in more bookings for the duo.\n\nJoan described the prominence of Ukrainian families in the town, residing in the local hotel, as another factor that increased demand for accommodation throughout the summer.\n\nJosephine Devitt has been running Copperfield House in Cashel, Co Tipperary, for the past 17 years.\n\nHaving taken over from her parents, who steered the business for over 35 years, Josephine is all too aware of the challenges faced in operating a B&B in a rural tourist town.\n\nSpeaking about the decline in her locality, Josephine said the town has been \u2018wiped out\u2019, with the number of B&Bs in Cashel dropping from 20 down to just three in a mere number of years.\n\nEchoing the sentiments expressed by Listowel B&B owner Joan Carmody, Josephine expressed her thoughts on the lack of new B&B businesses opening, revealing that many of the older generation who previously ran the B&B \u201chave now retired\u201d.\n\nNone of the younger generation are taking businesses over.\n\nWhen asked why this may be the case, Josephine suggested this unwillingness may stem from a fear of the hard work involved.\n\nF\u00e1ilte Ireland CEO Paul Kelly and B&B Ireland CEO Helena Healy, with Mary Spillane, the owner of Greenacres B&B in Rathcoole, Co Dublin. Picture: Shane O\u2019Neill, Coalesce\n\nThe majority of B&B bookings are completed online, and it is rare for guests to enquire about last-minute rooms, Josephine adds: \u201cA lot of our bookings are through either the website or on Booking.com. The ring of a doorbell rarely happens these days, you might get the odd person\u201d.\n\nJosephine proudly speaks of the large amount of return business she has received throughout the years, saying: \u201cYou know you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nTouching on the decline of the sector, Josephine explains that \u201ctimes are very different to what they were back then\u201d.\n\nHaving taken over the business as a stay-at-home mother herself, Josephine said: \u201cThere are fewer stay-at-home mums, who might have a spare room or two.\n\nBack then it was a handy way of earning extra cash, helping to put their child through college. Fewer women are staying in the home so that role is gone.\n\nOfficial figures bear out this statement, with 22% of women, a total of 370,300, stating in the 2006 census that their principal economic status was \u2018Looking after home/family\u2019.\n\nThis figure dropped vastly in 10 years, with 15% of women indicating in the 2016 census that they worked at home.\n\nThe census figures from 1991, near the time when Joan opened her B&B, show that 45% of women stayed at home then.\n\nWith fewer women choosing to stay at home to rear their children, there are fewer people choosing to undertake B&Bs as a viable career choice.\n\nF\u00e1ilte Ireland spokesman David Gash says the organisation views B&Bs \u201cas a very important part of Ireland\u2019s tourist accommodation offering, providing tourists with a unique and authentic experience\u201d.\n\nIn recognition of the important role that B&Bs play during the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Gash revealed that F\u00e1ilte Ireland administered approximately \u20ac8m in grants to B&Bs through the B&B Restart Plus funding scheme.\n\nMr Gash outlined the \u201dsuite of supports\u201d F\u00e1ilte Ireland has provided to the B&B sector in Ireland, including \u201cthe facility for B&Bs to become approved by F\u00e1ilte Ireland\u201d. He said:\n\nBy gaining F\u00e1ilte Ireland approval, businesses are listed on both Tourism Ireland\u2019s international consumer website, Ireland.com and F\u00e1ilte Ireland\u2019s domestic consumer website, DiscoverIreland.ie.\n\nB&B Ireland chief executive Helena Healy says the membership organisation offers offers representation for a number of B&Bs in Ireland, with over 800 properties benefitting from their service.\n\nMs Healy detailed the support B&B Ireland offers, from \u201cgeneral support on a day-to-day basis\u201d, to offering support for all matters, from the business side of things to client queries."
