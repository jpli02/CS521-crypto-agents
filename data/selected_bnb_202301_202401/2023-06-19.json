        "content": "Developers expect the opBNB testnet to reach speeds of 4,000 transactions per second (tps) at a targeted cost of 0.005 U.S. cents per transaction. These are similar speeds seen on blockchains such as Arbitrum, double those of BNB Chain, and significantly higher than Ethereum\u2019s 30 tps."

        "content": "Binance has announced the release of the opBNB testnet on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nThe layer 2 product is touted as the answer to the scalability aspect of the blockchain trilemma \u2013 the other two aspects being security and decentralization.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin coined the term blockchain trilemma to describe a situation where developers are forced to forego one of the aspects in favor of the other two \u2013 as achieving all three aspects is impossible in the current state of technological development.\n\nBSC is a fully compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine chain.\n\nopBNB uses Optimistic Rollups\n\nopBNB utilizes the Optimism OP Stack to achieve improved scalability, including Optimistic Rollups to process transactions off-chain \u2013 bundling them together to submit to the main chain.\n\nThe technology improves scalability and reduces the computational load on the main chain, making it easier to access data, improving the cache system, and enabling simultaneous operations.\n\nAccording to BNB Chain, opBNB\u2019s gas limit has been increased to 100M, allowing over 4,000 transactions per second and an average transaction cost below 0.005 USD.\n\nOptimism OP Stack is an open-source collection of independent components, such as architectural layers or runtime environments, that work together to execute an app.\n\nopBNB adopts a fraud-proving system to ensure transaction validity and network integrity. This mechanism allows anyone to challenge the results of a batched rollup transaction by computing a fraud-proof.\n\nIf proven fraudulent, the transaction(s) will be re-executed, maintaining the network\u2019s integrity and instilling trust while fostering greater transparency.\n\nBNB Chain calls on devs to experiment\n\nBNB Chain said the opBNB testnet marks a new chapter in BSC\u2019s journey to \u201ccreating a scalable, accessible, and cost-effective blockchain ecosystem.\u201d\n\nBy inviting developers and projects to experiment with opBNB, BNB Chain hopes to foster the growth of diverse applications, including gaming apps and social networks, to pave the way for a more efficient and cost-effective blockchain environment.\n\nThe testnet launched on June 19, with developer resources now available.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Expecting more bad news during this week, which should make price break the key support (range low, bottom dark zone in the chart). Below there, it could really be a free fall similar to FTT.\n\nSame targets. I wouldn\u2019t take profit on the first target, but I would take some profits on the main target if reached and leave part of the position open just in case.\n\nNot financial advice.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, BNB is worth $242.\n\nTurning to Ethereum (ETH), Capo says that the leading altcoin has already broken through a diagonal support level and is likely on its way down to much lower prices.

        "content": "BNB\n\nopBNB will reportedly mitigate congestion, reduce transaction costs, and create a high throughput environment.\n\nopBNB Joins the BNB Chain Ecosystem\n\nBNB Chain introduced opBNB on testnet, a Layer 2 (L2) solution built on the OP Stack. Designed with a block gas limit of 100M gas, opBNB looks to revolutionize gaming, decentralized exchanges, and the world of digital collectibles, promising a seamless and efficient experience for users.\n\nWith opBNB, BNB Chain envisions a future where the platform serves as a dedicated high-performance ledger for gaming applications while Binance Smart Chain (BSC) acts as a secure settlement layer.\n\n\"opBNB represents our commitment to ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for users, developers, and projects on BSC. This development is part of our ongoing mission to bring the power of blockchain to everyone while embracing and driving forward innovation,\" stated BNBChain in an official statement.\n\nAs an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer 2 chain, opBNB leverages the Optimism OP Stack to enhance BSC scalability without compromising affordability and security.\n\nAs per reports, one of the key breakthroughs of opBNB lies in its utilization of Optimistic Rollups, which offloads computation and state storage off-chain. This shift alleviates congestion, reduces transaction costs, and enables a high throughput environment. While transactions are executed outside the chain, their data is posted to the Mainnet as call data, ensuring a secure and valid record of activity.\n\nMoreover, opBNB operates within the broader BSC ecosystem, offering seamless interaction with a wide range of projects and tokens. Supported tokens include BNB, USDT, and other future ERC20 tokens on opBNB, providing developers and projects with a wealth of opportunities for collaboration and growth. $BNB is currently trading at $242.76, down 1.53% in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat is BNB Chain:\n\nBNB Chain is a community-driven, decentralized, and censorship-resistant blockchain powered by BNB. It consists of BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain. BNB Chain is EVM compatible and facilitates a multi-chain ecosystem. Through the concept of MetaFI, BNB Chain aims to build the infrastructure to power the world\u2019s parallel virtual ecosystem.\n\nFor more information on BNB Chain, these links:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Discord | Telegram | GitHub |"

        "content": "BTC\n\nBRC Chain aims to revolutionize BRC20 and Ordinals trading by offering innovative services, including cross-chain bridging, an advanced AMM DEX, and more.\n\nBRC Chain is revolutionizing the realm of BRC20 and Ordinals trading, offering a comprehensive solution that addresses pain points and propels the growth of this dynamic ecosystem. With its range of unique features and user-friendly interface, BRC Chain provides unparalleled opportunities for traders and enthusiasts alike.\n\nPain Points\n\nBridging Funds to the Bitcoin Network\n\nTraditional bridges fall short in providing robust cross-chain services between the Bitcoin network and EVM chains. Relying on centralized exchanges is both risky and impractical, especially given recent events.\n\nInconvenient Trading Experience\n\nThe current BRC20 marketplace relies on order books, resulting in delays as traders wait for order matches. Unlike instant swaps available on other DeFi platforms, the absence of a robust DEX infrastructure on the Bitcoin network compounds the inconvenience.\n\nHigh Fees and Slow Transactions\n\nBitcoin's network struggles to handle massive trading volumes, leading to exorbitant gas fees and sluggish transaction confirmations. This restricts traders from capitalizing swiftly on opportunities.\n\nUser-Unfriendly Experience\n\nThe concepts of BRC20 and ordinals are unfamiliar to many crypto traders, creating barriers to entry. Understanding transaction inscriptions, minting tokens, and calculating fees can be time-consuming and discouraging, hindering ecosystem growth.\n\nBRC Chain's Solutions\n\nSeamless Cross-Chain Bridging\n\nBRC Chain enables seamless cross-chain transactions between Bitcoin networks and EVM chains like BNB Chain and Ethereum. It offers a secure and convenient solution, eliminating the reliance on centralized exchanges and opening new avenues for decentralized trading.\n\nAdvanced AMM DEX\n\nWith BRC Swap, the AMM DEX on BRC Chain, traders can enjoy a hassle-free trading experience.

This incentivizes early adopters and provides a lucrative avenue for yield generation.\n\nLink: https://swap.brcchain.io/farms\n\n$BRC Rewards to Cover Fees\n\n$BRC, the native token of BRC Chain, serves as a utility and rewards mechanism. Traders can claim $BRC from the faucet by completing tasks and use it to offset transaction fees. Initial bridgers also receive $BRC rewards when they bridge their assets for the first time from BNB Smart Chain, Bitcoin, or Ethereum.\n\n\n\nLinks:\n\nBRC Faucet: https://faucet.brcchain.io/\n\nBRC Bridge: https://bridge.brcchain.io/\n\nMassive Airdrop Program\n\nBRC Chain's airdrop program allocates over 198M $BRC (19.8% of the total supply) to early adopters and supporters. This generous distribution rewards those who contribute to the ecosystem's growth and success.\n\nLinks:\n\n$BRC Airdrop Program\n\n$BRC Airdrop Program Criteria\n\nThe Utility BRC-20 Token $kBRC:\n\n$kBRC, the utility BRC-20 token of BRC Chain, represents kicking off the next level of BRC-20 trading.
