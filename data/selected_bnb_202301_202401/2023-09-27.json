        "content": "Advertisement\n\nYi He addressed the latest resignations, regulatory scrutiny and media criticism in her letter to company employees. In general, she highlighted that what Binance (BNB) is going through now is not new for the platform and its top management.\n\n\"Countless blood and fire baptisms\": Yi He on six years at Binance (BNB)\n\nRegardless of the behavior of regulators and competitors, Binance (BNB) employees should be focused on creating excellent products and providing an excellent user experience for all customers. That is the only way to build competitive advantages in 2023, Yi He says in her letter shared today on X.\n\nShe decided to write this letter regarding increased regulatory pressure and \"aggressive marketing from some competitors.\" Yesterday, Wall Street Journal published another anti-Binance longread.\n\nYi He highlighted that almost all Binance (BNB) competitors can enjoy far more relaxed compliance, KYC/AML, proof of reserves and other requirements. Also, the status of the largest exchange in the world affects the platform's efficiency.\n\nThat is why the exchange has been the target of \"countless blood and fire baptisms\" since its launch. To cope with these attacks, employees should react on all challenges with \"logics,\" not with emotions, Yi He added.\n\nIn its strategy, Binance (BNB) should be focused on making excellent and resource-efficient products and providing excellent services to every single customer.\n\n2019 \"battles\" more challenging for Binance, cofounder says\n\nAlso, Yi He compared the ongoing situation with the crypto recession of 2019. She recalled that back then, Binance (BNB) was not delivering the majority of its ongoing products: it lacked a fiat gateway, Binance P2P, Binance Futures and so on. But even then, Binance (BNB) managed to become a leader and \"turn the tables\" in the segment:\n\nThis is not the first time, nor it will be the last showdown (...) Every battle is a do-or-die situation, and the only thing that can defeat us is ourselves.\n\nAt the same time, Binance (BNB) won countless time and has to win yet again, the cofounder says.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Binance (BNB) is going through a legal battle with the U.S. SEC. Also, it faces charges from the US DoJ over sanctions evasion.\n\nToday Binance (BNB) announced that it is completely exiting Russia, which had been one of its largest markets. Binance (BNB) users will migrate to previously unknown platform CommEX."

        "title": "No One\u2019s Prepared for Massive Cardano, XRP and Binance Coin Correction, Says Crypto Analyst Nicholas Merten - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is warning that several altcoins could soon undergo severe market corrections due to one main factor.\n\nIn a new strategy session, DataDash host Nicholas Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that declining market liquidity could send Cardano (ADA), XRP and Binance Coin (BNB) much lower.\n\nAccording to Merten, BNB could decline by more than 38% from its current value after dipping below two long-term support levels.\n\nBNB is trading for $211.25 at time of writing, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours.\n\nNext, the trader says that XRP, the token associated with Ripple Lab\u2019s payments platform, is facing downward pressure from a large volume of selling that could cause it to collapse by 70%.\n\n\u201cI think this is going to come down in history as one of the biggest distribution patterns in the history of crypto\u2026\n\nThe price action shows it here. There\u2019s more available supply as there\u2019s been more distribution and unloading of previously locked supply on the market. And you can see it here within the price action. And I\u2019m not excited buying something like XRP even as a speculative asset until I come down here and test this line of support [at the $0.15 level].\n\nEven from there, I\u2019m worried that this might have been a long-term distribution pattern where there\u2019s no return in sight back above this level once it breaks.\u201d\n\nXRP is trading for $0.50 at time of writing, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, the trader predicts that Ethereum (ETH) rival Cardano will decline by more than 37% from its current value after a bullish triple-bottom price pattern fails to take shape.\n\n\u201cTake a look here at ADA/USD. A lot of people are really excited about Cardano potentially setting in a triple bottom here. But I got to tell you, notice here how as time progresses consistent resistance, weaker relative highs here versus the past. I think this snaps lower. I think this is going down to $0.15.\n\nI\u2019m not here to argue about which projects are good or bad. I\u2019m here to say at the end of the day that the direction, the underlying thing that is going to set the momentum for either direction and price, the broad price performance of financial assets including cryptocurrencies is liquidity and unless liquidity starts to rebound, ADA is likely going lower.\u201d\n\nCardano is trading for $0.24 at time of writing, down 0.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says that Ethereum appears stuck in a bearish cycle since April 2023 after failing to hold $2,000 as support.\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,588 at time of writing, down 0.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Monetize Your Gaming Time with Kangamoon While BNB and Uniswap Prices Fall Sharply - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe recent rally of the cryptocurrency market has ended with most coins back in the red region. With no significant development, BNB and Uniswap (UNI) face significant price declines. At the same time, Kangamoon, with its innovative features, is making waves in the Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming space, captivating gamers\u2019 interest.\n\nSummary:\n\nBNB price has remained above the $210 support level.\n\nUniswap ranks moderate volatility in its price reading.\n\nKongamoon merges gaming and P2E gaming in a unique virtual world.\n\nBNB Price Drops, But Holds\n\nThe majority of coins in the crypto market draw their strength from BTC. So the rise and the fall in prices of BTC invariably affects them all. As a result, in the recent Bitcoin upswing above $27,000, the price of the BNB coin fared quite well.\n\nHowever, the upswing was short-lived as the BNB was rejected at the $220 resistance. As a result, the price of BNB has been dropping. However, BNB seems to be holding its head above water, finding support at $210.\n\nLeveling at above $210, BNB has managed to prevent its value from dropping below a key significant level. However, analysts believe that if the prices remain at this current rate and probably reach a high of $250, BNB will do well in the next bullish upswing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnisawp (UNI) Falls Sharply, Approaches $4 Support\n\nLike BNB, the Uniswap price chart has been bullish for most of September. However, the altcoin has lost its bullish momentum as the crypto market slips into bear territory. From a price value of $4.45, UNI now looks set to target the $4.00 support.\n\nHowever, market analysts have given Uniswap a 31 volatility rating, meaning the token may halt its sharp decline. In addition, there has been notable growth in on-chain activities on the Uniswap exchange.\n\nAccording to data trackers, there has been an increase in wallet addresses and active daily transactions on Uniswap. This in turn could help the Uniswap price to experience a mild upswing.\n\nKangamoon Raises Excitement in Blockchain P2E Space\n\nAs per a report from Market and Markets, the Play-to-Earn NFT gaming space is a billion-dollar market. Market and Markets predicts the sector to reach a market valuation of $8.85 billion by 2028. In this fast-growing market, Kangamoon has raised excitement among gamers.\n\nAs a P2E game, Kangamoon will allow players to earn money but ensure they are having fun. Kangamoon is a P2E game set on the character of a boxing kangaroo. This adventure game tests the creativity and skills of players to the limit.\n\nAmong its many alluring features is the ability for players to create avatars and custom items and sell these on Kangamoon\u2019s native marketplace for tokens known as KANG. Also, there are weekly tournaments where players compete against opponents from all over the world and earn real cash from every gameplay.\n\nBecause of its unique system, crypto experts have called Kangamoon the knockout meme of 2023. Presently, Kongamoon is at stage 1 of presale, valued at $0.005, and it is forecasted to yield a whopping 3,000% ROI by the time it gets listed on the market.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Kangamoon (KANG) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://Kangamoon.com/\n\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/Kangamoonofficial\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

        "content": "This Halloween, Donkey has you covered!\n\nDreamWorks\u2019 lovable sidekick is letting you vacation in Shrek\u2019s Swamp! Guests of the animated early 2000s classic Shrek can soon call the ogre\u2019s stumpy, secluded haven home thanks to Airbnb.\n\nDonkey will be house-sitting for his trusty companion, and has decided to open up the Swamp doors for an exclusive two-night swamp stay for up to three friends from Oct. 27-29, 2023.\n\nThe mud-laden, moss-covered, murky-watered oasis that is Shrek\u2019s Swamp is nestled in the hills of the Scottish Highlands.\n\nThis charming and cozy refuge is the perfect secluded spot to enjoy a brisk autumn day and starry nights to hibernate like a true ogre would. The live-in tree stump features a studio layout with two beds and one bathroom.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nShrek House Air Bnb, Bed. Alix McIntosh\n\nAlthough there are signs labeled \u201cDanger,\u201d \u201cStay Out,\u201d and \u201cBeware Ogre\u201d that lead up to the Swamp house, think of it as Shrek\u2019s way of welcoming you home.\n\nThe property is a perfectly snug spot to escape from village life and embrace the beauty of nature.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted to invite you in for a fairytale stay,\u201d Donkey said in a description of the listing posted to Airbnb.\n\nShrek House Air Bnb, Dining Room. Alix McIntosh\n\nWhile vacationing in the Swamp, guests will have the chance to stay up late, swap stories, and eat like an ogre \u2014 because in the morning, Donkey\u2019s making waffles!\n\nThis will be the first time fans are welcomed into Shrek\u2019s humble abode and in true ogre fashion, the toilet, sink and shower facilities will be located off-site, approximately 20 meters away from Shrek\u2019s Swamp.\n\nShrek House Air Bnb, Outhouse. Alix McIntosh\n\n\u201cShrek\u2019s Swamp is lovely. Just beautiful. The perfect place to entertain guests,\u201d Donkey said. \u201cYou know what I like about it? Everything. The overgrown landscaping, the modest interiors, the nice boulders, all of it. I can\u2019t wait for guests to experience this muddy slice of paradise for themselves.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that staying at Shrek\u2019s Swamp isn\u2019t a contest! Any fan of the ogre can stay for just \u00a30 a night \u2014 a nod to the priceless refuge he has provided fairytale creatures of all kinds!\n\nHowever, those interested will have to abide by a few simple rules.\n\nGuests at Shrek\u2019s Swamp must have an active Airbnb profile with a good track record on the platform, own a government-issued ID, and be at least 5 years of age, in addition to several other terms and conditions.\n\nSince this isn\u2019t a contest, guests are responsible for their own travel to and from Scotland.\n\nThe wildly popular franchise featured Mike Myers as the voice of Shrek, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona.\n\nTo honor good childhood memories that last a lifetime, Airbnb will make a one-time donation to HopScotch Children\u2019s Charity, which provides some of Scotland\u2019s most vulnerable and disadvantaged children with respite breaks through nurturing and dynamic holiday trips.\n\nOnion and ogre enthusiasts can request to book Shrek\u2019s Swamp beginning Oct. 13 at 6 p.m. BST at airbnb.com/shrek.\n\nShrek\u2019s Swamp isn\u2019t the only mega movie mansion that\u2019s been up for grabs as of late.\n\nEarlier this year, Airbnb reopened the doors to the Barbie Dream House in Malibu ahead of the iconic doll\u2019s July 21 feature film release!\n\nBarbie's Malibu Dreamhouse up for rent on Airbnb. Airbnb/Hogwash Studios\n\nIn stark contrast to the ogre\u2019s unique stay, visitors of Barbie\u2019s multilevel pink home enjoyed a disco dance floor, a roller rink, a gym, a bar and grill, and an infinity pool (adorned with floats that spell out Ken\u2019s name, of course).\n\nHowever, like Shrek\u2019s Swamp, those staying at the Malibu mansion were also able to do so at no cost to them \u201cbecause Ken couldn\u2019t figure out how to put a price on Barbie\u2019s Malibu Dream House \u2014 after all, Ken\u2019s thing is beach, not math!\u201d"
