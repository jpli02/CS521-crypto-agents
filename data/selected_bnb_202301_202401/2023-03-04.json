        "content": "Binance Chain\u2019s daily transactions recorded a year-to-date growth of 229%.\n\nThe network\u2019s NFT trading volume declined sharply in February.\n\nBinance Chain [BNB] recorded a big jump in its daily transaction volume over the week, rising from 3.5 million to over 5 million at the time of writing.\n\nWhile this amounted to a nearly 47% rise, a closer look at the data revealed that the chain\u2019s year-to-date (YTD) growth was also impressive.

This indicated that BNB faced increased selling pressure and could sink further.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggested a bearish outcome for the coin as well while the On Balance Volume (OBV) showed a marginal drop.\n\nThese indicators sounded a warning alarm for BNB and the support at $289 might not hold for good."

        "content": "Yikes! Sister Wives star Meri Brown has been slammed by critics for her expensive Lizzie\u2019s Heritage Inn retreats. Most of the time, her bed-and-breakfast was criticized for its prices. During season 12 of the hit TLC reality series, Meri first revealed that she wanted to take over the Parowan, Utah, inn. Although her former husband, Kody Brown, wasn\u2019t initially keen on the idea, the plural family later warmed up to it, and Meri has proudly promoted her bed-and-breakfast ever since then. The reality TV star\u2019s inn has received accolades in the past, including the Official Best of America\u2019s \u201cBest Country Inn\u201d award in 2018 and 2019. Meri even added a personal touch to the location, including beautiful antiques and a simplistic, country theme for guests to enjoy. However, her inn quickly faced the wrath from fans after she promoted the hotel\u2019s first-ever retreat in November 2022, which offered a package that ranged in price from \u201c$4,500 to $6,400 depending on if you want the VIP treatment or not,\u201d she said in a Facebook video at the time. The four-day retreat\u2019s packages included breakfast, lunch and dinner, with Meri explaining that the occasion would offer a \u201cweekend of adventure.\u201d She elaborated that the getaway was intended to focus on \u201cinspiration\u201d and \u201cconnection.\u201d Upon noticing the sky-high costs, fans took to the comments section under Meri\u2019s video to weigh in about the expenses. \u201cWow! That pricing is absolutely insane! You have officially lost my respect,\u201d one person wrote, whereas another pointed out, \u201cYikes. I can go to Disney World for that price.\u201d Nevertheless, the former sister wife kept her head up and reflected on the backlash in an Instagram post following the retreat. \u201cInner peace and self-reflection is something many of us forget about, as we go along our day to day being busy, taking care of all the daily tasks, and serving others,\u201d Meri captioned her post at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to take time to tune out the noise and distractions so you can figure out what is most important to YOU. \u2026 Don\u2019t let yourself get distracted by the voices of others, voices that have no part in your story. Live your life with passion and joy! Remember, you\u2019re worthy of having all you want in your life. You deserve it, and you\u2019re worth it!\u201d However, this wasn\u2019t the last time that the Sister Wives cast member has encountered backlash from fans for her bed-and-breakfast. She was slammed by countless online users once again in January 2023 for boasting about a similar excursion with exorbitant prices.

        "title": "Financial institutions and corporate offices \u201chollowing out\u201d - Kuensel, Buhutan's National Newspaper",
        "content": "\u2026 employees are having to deal with fatigue\n\nRinzin Wangchuk\n\nThe high rate of attrition is \u201chollowing out\u201d financial institutions and corporate offices of their human resources even as some of these agencies are moving their services online.\n\nAmong the financial institutions (FIs), Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan Limited\u2019s (RICBL) head office in Thimphu never had so many of its cubicles vacant. \u201cWe have been hollowed out due to a high attrition rate, RICBL\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Karma said. \u201cThis happens with key people resigning for better opportunities.\u201d\n\nRICBL, which has about 450 employees across the country, saw a total of 80 employees exit from 2022 to date. The company\u2019s office in Thimphu alone lost 60 employees, mostly key people. RICBL has a regional office in Phuentsholing and 25 branch offices spread across the country.\n\nThe insurance company has announced 60 vacancies to fill up the human resource gap.\n\n\u201cWe will not replace all of them since we are moving our services and products online such as our mobile application, MyRICBL, through which one can pay loan instalments, insurance and avail of other services,\u201d RICBL Chief Executive Officer Karma said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will reskill and upskill existing staff to assume the vacant posts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be multitasking.\u201d\n\nKarma said that the management is also aware of the risk of employees becoming fatigued. \u201cAs they multitask for a long duration, their productivity will drop and there will be the risk of making errors. So in as many areas as possible, we will use technology,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that since the organisations in Bhutan cannot stop people from leaving, the smart way to manage is to invest in increasing the productivity of those who remain. \u201cResource management is crucial in ensuring productivity.\u201d\n\nRICBL, the second oldest financial institution in the country, is the only multi-faceted financial service provider in Bhutan catering life insurance, general insurance, credit facilities and other social security schemes. Incorporated on January 7, 1975, under the Royal Charter, RICBL is a public limited company with 39 percent of the total shares held by the government and the rest 61 percent by the public and private organisations and individuals.\n\nWhile Bhutan Development Bank Corporation Limited (BDBL) lost a significant number of staff over one year, the bank officials said that there was not much impact on the human resource capacity. \u201cThe moratorium imposed on loans by the central bank in May last year had reduced the workload of employees. The bank caters services to in rural communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the total 576 employees, 105 employees excluding five general managers left BDBL. \u201cIf the loans were not suspended, we have to recruit the same number of employees who left the bank,\u201d an official said.\n\nFollowing a directive from the Royal Monetary Authority, BDBL suspended sanctioning loans because of high non-performing loans (NPL). NPL are loans with payments that are overdue by 90 days or more.\n\nThe attrition rate in Bhutan National Bank (BNB) is also not as high as other FIs are facing today. As of December 2022, only 23 staff resigned from the total human resource strength of 521. However, the bank lost eight employees and another eight took extraordinary leave (EOL) in January and February this year, according to BNB officials.\n\n\u201cAs of now, the employees are multitasked to cater services and we don\u2019t face a major challenge,\u201d an official said.\n\nThe country\u2019s oldest financial institution, Bank of Bhutan Limited (BoBL) saw 49 employees exit in 2022 and 21 staff in the past two months. The bank officials said that it is a bit early to comment on recruitment since the organisational development exercise (OD) hasn\u2019t been completed.\n\nOther agencies\n\nPeople migrating to Australia, Canada and other countries have also equally impacted other corporate agencies and employees are fatigued with multiple responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, National Housing Corporation Limited (NHDCL) is facing serious challenges of not being able to do succession planning given the current trend of employees leaving in large numbers and in an ad-hoc manner.\n\n\u201cUnless there are some policy level interventions, it will be next to impossible to encourage people to stay back,\u201d NHDCL\u2019s CEO Rinchen Wangdi said.\n\nNHDCL has a total staff strength of 147 as of March 2 this year. In 2022, the company saw 20 employees including engineers and architects leave the company and another five resigned in the past two months.\n\nThe overall impact due to staff resigning in large numbers to the organisation, according to Rinchen Wangdi, is the additional work for those who are left behind and the difficulty in maintaining the continuity of the ongoing work especially when it is an important project.\n\nHe said that employees leaving suddenly with one month\u2019s notice period and some even shorter periods create great inconvenience to the office.\n\n\u201cWhen those who are looking after important and complex projects leave suddenly are the worst cases since it takes time for the new one to understand the complexity and background of the project,\u201d Rinchen Wangdi said. \u201cThere are chances of lapses that might happen due to short overlap or no overlap between the two.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also said that those who agree to take up the additional work are not able to focus on their work at hand and end up working extra time on a daily basis and even sacrificing their weekends.\n\n\u201cThis affects their mental health,\u201d he said adding that there are many who are contemplating resigning due to the stress from additional work.\n\nThe CEO also said that even the division heads including the head of organisation had to step in to fill the human resources gap since those leaving are mostly mid-level professionals with substantial experience.\n\n\u201cManagement is not able to concentrate on bigger issues and at the strategy level since they are bogged down with the minor issues,\u201d he said.\n\nSome agencies also find it difficult to get replacements from the open market. \u201cIt takes time and resources for the new recruit to learn,\u201d an official said. \u201cThere are no candidates even in the market for some of the key positions like finance and project management.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany new employees who join the office, according to one of the corporate officials, are also in transit mode since there is no guarantee these people will not leave. There are many instances where new recruits also left the company not long after joining the office. \u201cUnless there are some policy level interventions, it will be next to impossible to encourage people to stay back,\u201d he said.\n\nBhutan Power Corporation (BPC) saw its highest attrition rate of 12.14 percent in 2022, according to an official from the human resource department. Of the total 2,415 employees in January 2022, 282 resigned and the company recruited 99 employees in the same year.\n\nThe attrition rate in January and February this year stands at 11.12 percent. 41 employees separated in just two months. As of February 28, BPC has a total staff strength of 2,191.\n\nBPC officials said that one department lost seven engineers in one year. \u201cBecause of the loss of engineers, we are facing problems in the office to solve technical issues,\u201d the official said."

        "title": "Airbnb SWOT Analysis - Business Model Analyst",
        "content": "Airbnb is a name that has become almost synonymous with the rental industry. The company rose to prominence after it disrupted the traditional hotel industry and has since attempted to dominate other sectors within the travel and hospitality industry. Let\u2019s take a look at the Airbnb SWOT analysis to fully understand just how the company was able to achieve this.\n\nA Brief Look at Airbnb\n\nAirbnb is a major player in the rental and booking sector and has introduced an innovative model when it comes to rental services. The company is well known for its effective branding, and marketing itself as more than just a company that provides houses, but one which also provides the experience of home.\n\nThrough the use of strategic partnerships and acquisitions, the brand has quickly built itself to be one of the strongest and most rounded players in the market. It is involved in various areas, such as luxury rentals, food technology, home listings, and so on.\n\nThe company has been seeing strong growth over the last few years and has cemented its position as a dominant player in the market with a quarter of the market share. Let\u2019s take a look at the strings, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to this highly successful business.\n\nAirbnb Strengths\n\nHere are some of the competitive advantages enjoyed by Airbnb.\n\nAirbnb Enjoys First-Mover Advantage\n\nAirbnb was undoubtedly not the first company to attempt to introduce a novel business model into the hospitality industry, it was the first to do it successfully and at scale. The beneficial phenomenon associated with being the first popularly successful business in an industry is known as a first-mover advantage. As its name suggests, it comes with several perks.\n\nFirst of all, first-movers enjoy a great deal of brand awareness, customer loyalty, and a positive brand association. This is because, initially, being the sole product on the market naturally creates a strong relationship between customers and the brand. It also gives the brand more time to build vital supply chain structures and partnerships, which gives them an advantage over future competition.\n\nWhile these advantages typically do not last forever, by the time other significant players in the industry may have appeared, a first-mover company like Airbnb must have carved out a significant part of the market share as well as positioned its brand favorably.\n\nIt Takes Advantage of the Network Effect\n\nThe network effect is another helpful phenomenon within the business world. It describes a situation where the value and quality of a product or service increase when an increasing number of people utilize it. Airbnb is also a company that takes advantage of this phenomenon. This is because an increasing number of renters will attract more hosts to the platform, which in turn increases the available listings and attracts more renters.\n\nAlso, if enough people have positive experiences while using the platform, this will act as free marketing since they would recommend it to others. This eventually encourages hosts to put more effort into ensuring that customers have a positive experience with their services and, by extension, give positive reviews. All these eventually form positive feedback loops where growth promotes further escalation of the platform.\n\nInnovative Business Model\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of the Airbnb company is the innovative business model which it introduced into the hospitality and rental industry. Airbnb is designed as a community-based, two-sided platform that helps facilitate listings and bookings between hosts and renters. The company does not own or manage any of the properties which it advertises, merely acting as a middleman in the rental process (while charging them a fee for this service).\n\nThere are several advantages to their business model. Firstly, their system allows the company to advertise a much wider range of properties than other traditional traveling agencies and hotel chains. Hosts are also not charged a fee for listing the property, only when the location is rented out. Hosts are also able to set their prices, allowing them to undercut the hotels since they do not have to worry about expensive overhead costs like maintenance, wages, booking fees, and hotel taxes. These cheaper prices are passed along to customers, thereby incentivizing them to choose Airbnb over travel agencies.\n\nCustomers, on the other hand, also have greater flexibility when it comes to renting options. Airbnb offers a range of listing options ranging from high-end luxurious locations to cozy one-bedroom listings depending on what the customer desires. This exposes renters to a broader range of experiences rather than being stuck with the stereotypical hotel experience, thereby enhancing customer experience.\n\nStrong Branding and Effective Marketing\n\nIn the last few years, Airbnb has focused on promoting a new marketing campaign headlined\u201cBelong Anywhere,\u201d which is targeted toward creating a more inclusive and community-driven brand. The company explained that the primary motivation behind this campaign was to push the public\u2019s perception of the company away from being merely a rental site to one that provides an authentic home-like experience.\n\nThis rebranding effort included a new logo (named the \u201cB\u00e9lo,\u201d which represents people, place, love, and the \u201ca\u201d of Airbnb), as well as a greater degree of customer interaction through their revamped distribution channels. The platform also added a \u201cDiscover\u201d feature, which allowed renters to explore exotic listing locations through a collage of locations and rentals.\n\nThey Offer a Unique Traveling Experience\n\nA vital part of the Airbnb brand identity is its ability to offer customers a unique traveling experience. Many times, hotels have been accused of offering stereotypical and artificial guest experiences. However, by using the services of Airbnb, guests can immerse themselves in the local culture by choosing to list options that are more deeply embedded within the community. This allows them to enjoy authentic holiday experiences as well as widens their worldview.\n\nAirbnb promotes this in several ways. We have already mentioned their \u201cDiscover\u201d feature, which exposes renters to potential locations in listing options, but they also have several other valuable features such as \u201cExperiences\u201d and \u201cPlaces\u201d pages. The \u201cExperiences\u201d page allows users to explore fun local activities which are available around the rental area, such as pottery, hiking, and camping. \u201cPlaces,\u201d on the other hand, inform renters of iconic locations such as amusement parks, monuments, and scenic restaurants.\n\nThe Company Is Publicly Traded\n\nAirbnb is a publicly traded company and therefore enjoys the advantages that come with this. For example, when the company went public in 2020, its shares gained 112% in just the first day of training. This IPO allowed the company to raise significant amounts of risk-free capital rather quickly, as well as improve its attractiveness to investors. Another advantage of this is that stock options are an excellent way for companies to compete in the labor market and hire the best talent.\n\nAside from the favorable media coverage offered by such public offerings, customers also have more confidence in publicly traded companies. Publicly traded companies are also audited more frequently and closely than private firms, allowing for greater transparency, credibility, and investor confidence as well.\n\nGlobal Expansion\n\nFrom its humble beginnings in San Francisco, Airbnb has grown into an international brand with over 6 million listings, 4 million hosts, and 150 million users, who have booked over 1 billion stays in more than 100, 000 cities in over 220 countries. This level of global reach gives the company a significant competitive advantage over its closest rivals as well as the ability to cater to the needs of a wide range of customers through cheaper prices and more options.\n\nDual Rating System\n\nThe booking and hospitality industry is built on reputation and customer experience. Therefore, Airbnb introduced a dual rating system, which allows both renters and hosts to make mutual assessments of their experience.\n\nThis creates an incentive for both renters and hosts to be on their best behavior. This is because hosts with higher ratings will see their listings being utilized more often. On the other hand, notoriously troublesome renters will be rated poorly by the platform and may even be barred from using their services.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions\n\nAirbnb is a company well known for its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, with the company spending well over $700 million on building a strong network that allows you to capitalize on various supply chains within the hospitality industry. These investments include areas such as social platforms, online travel, and even food technology.\n\nSome of the key purchases made by the company include HotelTonight (a travel agency and metasearch engine acquired by the company for $450 million in 2019), Luxury Retreats (a rental service that specializes in luxury rentals which the company purchased in 2017 for $200-$300 million), Accomable (a London-based holiday booking platform which the company acquired in 2017 for an undisclosed amount), and so on.\n\nHealthy Balance Sheet and Gross Margin\n\nDespite its not-so-distant struggles or profitability, Airbnb, for most of its history, has maintained a healthy balance sheet and large gross revenue. This is quite encouraging to investors and suggests that the company has strong potential for future growth due to its strong financial position. Also, the company has been posting steadily increasing revenues over the last few years, generating revenues of over $8.4 billion in 2022, a 40% YoY increase, and its first fully profitable year with a net profit of $1.9 billion that same year.\n\nAirbnb Weaknesses\n\nHere are some of the weaknesses of the company.\n\nThe Company Initially Struggled With Profitability\n\nAlthough Airbnb was launched in 2008 and has raked in billions of dollars in revenue over the past few years, for an extended period, the company struggled with profitability and first managed to achieve an annual net profit in 2017, before briefly lapsing back into net losses the following year.\n\nWhile this may be considered a normal part of the business\u2019s development plan, with many businesses focusing on growth and achieving a significant market share even at the expense of profitability, it may be worrisome to investors. This is especially true because the company operates within a sector famous for its volatility and unpredictable nature, as evidenced by the downturn experienced in the industry during the pandemic.\n\nEver-Changing Legal Regulations\n\nAirbnb introduced a relatively new business model into the hospitality and tourism industry. As expected, there was a prolonged period of confusion and lack of regulation due to the inexperience of the law with such a system. However, over time, new regulations have sprung up as lawmakers and other stakeholders within the industry have become familiar with both the direct and indirect consequences of such a business model.\n\nWhile not all of these regulations may be detrimental to the success of Airbnb, uncertain future regulations create an unfavorable business environment that may scare off investors. For example, some cities have created legal frameworks burning the use of short-term rentals, such as Airbnb listings. While they may have credible reasons for this, it negatively affects Airbnb rentals in these regions.\n\nTheir Business Model Is Easy to Imitate\n\nEven though Airbnb was the first company to introduce its business model into the hospitality and rental industry, it did not remain alone for long. The Airbnb business model is relatively easy to imitate, and it is cheaper for competitors to build on a business model which has already been designed. Therefore, the company now faces greater market share competition.\n\nSome Hosts Charge Inflated Prices\n\nDespite their focus on offering cheaper alternatives to the hotel industry, because Airbnb does not directly interfere with how the hosts price their properties, some hosts have been known to offer inflated prices when compared with the services offered. This affects customer experience negatively and creates a poor brand image for the company.\n\nClaims of Fraudulent Activities\n\nAirbnb\u2019s rentals have been accused of being a part of several fraudulent activities. A popular example is what is known as bait and switch scams, in which a particular rental property will be listed for a price. Still, upon choosing the property, the renter will be redirected to a more expensive property listed elsewhere.\n\nOther types of scams the company has been involved in include multiple listings, inaccurate descriptions of property, account hacking, the use of doctored images, fake customer reviews, and illegal payments made outside the platform. Also, some authorities have claimed that Airbnb\u2019s are popular among criminal elements due to the reduced amount of scrutiny that hosts may put on their guests.\n\nAccusations of Racial Discrimination\n\nAirbnb has long been the subject of controversy surrounding accusations of racial discrimination against people of color and other minorities. A 2015 study from Harvard showed that individuals with names that sound like they may belong to a minority have a more difficult time booking on the platform. This caused significant controversy within the company and further encouraged them to tighten the non-discrimination policy when it comes to hosts. However, the stain of the scandal is still yet to fully fade, especially with more instances of hosts discriminating against ethnic minorities and people of color.\n\nPoor Search Engine Optimization\n\nOne complaint that many users have had is difficulty in finding Airbnb listings from a search engine. The top listings are more likely to be hotel reservations or travel agencies, with relevant Airbnb listings only being shown if the Airbnb keyword is inserted. This may suggest that the company needs to invest more in search engine optimization to ensure that its listings rank highly.\n\nLack of Quality Control\n\nSince Airbnb does not own the properties which it advertises, you can only do so much to ensure quality control amongst its listings. The company has made some efforts to make sure that guests enjoy the very best experience. This includes things such as host identity verification, personally inspecting listings when possible, their dual rating system, enforcing accurate descriptions of the available amenities as well as providing 24/7 customer care services to travelers. However, despite all their efforts, there are still significant complaints about the quality of listings by hosts.\n\nAirbnb Opportunities\n\nLet\u2019s look at some helpful ideas which could drive further growth and development for Airbnb.\n\nExpansion Into New Markets\n\nWhile Airbnb is officially available in over 220 countries and 100,000 cities, its prominence within these regions differs significantly. As expected, most of its revenue is generated from its North American market. However, this exposes the brand to significant downturns in the economy of its major market.\n\nThe brand can make significant efforts to expand its markets in developing economies such as Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Also, even though the brand has a significant presence in Europe, especially the major cities like London, Paris, Rome, and Madrid, it is much less popular in other parts of Europe. This is unfortunate because Airbnb listings are some of the best ways to enjoy an authentic local travel experience.\n\nAcquiring Further Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions\n\nEven though the company is well-known for its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, it can further invest in this area, allowing it to reduce competition and increase its competitive advantage within the market. This includes diversifying into other areas associated with the rental and hospitality industry as well.\n\nChanges In How People Want To Experience Leisure Travel\n\nPreviously, when people spoke about leisure travel, they mainly meant prepackaged tours to well-known locations and staying at traditional hotel chains. However, a good number of people now want an authentic local experience that allows them to interact with natives and better understand the culture of the area they are visiting.\n\nTo do this, they will need an accommodation option that immerses them right in the midst of the natives and makes local attractions more accessible. Interacting with native hosts is also a great way to learn about the culture they are visiting instead of being subjected to prepackaged tours.\n\nIncreased Focus on Luxury Rentals\n\nJust as some travelers are looking for more cozy and immersive rentals to enjoy an authentic travel experience, some renters would instead enjoy an exotic, luxurious holiday. By increasing the number of luxury listings the platform offers, Airbnb will be able to attract more potential renters from this niche as well as increase their revenue.\n\nInvest In a Seamless Mobile Experience\n\nMany users now make bookings directly from mobile devices. Therefore, by investing in a seamless mobile experience, Airbnb can enhance customer experience and boost bookings.\n\nAirbnb Threats\n\nLet\u2019s explore some of the potential threats to the Airbnb business model.\n\nIncreased Competition\n\nDue to the success of Airbnb, many other businesses within the hospitality industry are trying to copy their business model. This will lead to increased competition from rental services, rental agencies, and hotel chains. This competition reduces the market share of the company, driving down profits and eventually constituting a significant threat to its continued success.\n\nEconomic Downturns\n\nThe travel industry is one which is strongly dependent on the situation of the economy. The struggles faced by various sectors associated with travel and hospitality, such as aviation, rentals, and entertainment, expose the vulnerability of the industry. Airbnb relies on strong positive economic indicators to promote growth and significant downturns such as those caused by pandemics, recessions or war, or a threat to business.\n\nDecreasing Acceptance of Home-Sharing\n\nThe aftermath of the Covid pandemic has left a visible mark on the home-sharing culture. Certain people are now reluctant to rent out their properties on Airbnb due to health and safety reasons. Hopefully, as more people around the world are fully vaccinated, and this stigma and fear associated with COVID-19 die down, this trend may also reduce.\n\nNegative Guest Experiences\n\nThe hospitality industry is built on positive experiences. Therefore, negative experiences both on behalf of travelers and hosts are a significant threat to the success of the Airbnb business model. Include altercations between hosts and renters, posts canceling reservations, fraudulent listings, overpricing, and so on.\n\nUser Data Security Leaks\n\nAirbnb maintains a vast database of user information such as credit card details, rental details, and background verification information. Therefore, a leak would be catastrophic to the reputation of the company as well as expose them to potential lawsuits. Also, user data privacy is one of the most critical contemporary issues within the business world today. There have been accusations that companies such as Airbnb, which maintains such large databases of personal information, could potentially use this information to profit off of their customers.\n\nConclusion\n\nAirbnb is more than just a rental company. They are major disruptors within the industry and changed how we view leisure vacations, rental accommodations, and the meaning of an authentic holiday experience. The business is showing no signs of slowing growth with strong financial indicators as well as successful marketing, and is well poised to remain a dominant figure in the industry for years to come."
