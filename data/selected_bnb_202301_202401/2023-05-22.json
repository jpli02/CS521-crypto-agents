        "content": "Scarborough bed and breakfast named best in the world for third time\n\nThe Toulson Court has retained the title\n\nAuthor: Karen Liu Published 23rd May 2023\n\nLast updated 23rd May 2023\n\nA bed and breakfast in Scarborough has been named the best in the world for a third time in a row.\n\nTripadvisor has announced the winners of its 2023 Travellers' Choice Best of the Best Hotel Awards.\n\nIt analysed 12-months of review data (1st January 2022 - 31st December 2022) from over 1.5 million hotels, revealing people's favourite accommodations across 10 categories.\n\nThe Toulson Court has over 2,000 'excellent' reviews on the site, with guests praising the B & B for offering a warm welcome, excellent service and little extras - including the singing chef.\n\nOne Tripadvisor reviewer claimed they would have given 10 stars if they could, but it still would not have been enough.\n\nThe Toulson Court is run by Angela and James Rusden, who said: \"It's absolutely amazing. I mean we were amazed when we won it for the first time but to do it three times it's just unbelievable. Nobody has ever won it three times as well so it was a sort of a little challenge at the beginning of the year 'oh, shall we go for a third time?' But it's an amazing feeling and it's fantastic. It's down the guests that come and visits us and what Scarborough has to offer everybody.\n\n\"To be fair when we first moved here we had no intentions of anything and we were one of the top ones in Scarborough on Tripadvisor then all of a sudden we became number one in Scarborough, then North Yorkshire, England and now best B & B in the world.\n\n\"I think you'll find with bed and breakfasts that you have to have a nice comfortable bed, a nice clean room and a fantastic breakfast. They're the main requirements that people need to meet and then the extras are the things you put into the room like the fridges or the Alexas but then it's being able to help people as well.\n\n\"We go the extra mile. We're a service industry and that's what we were from originally. I think by providing a nice service and make everybody's stay nice, luxurious, happy, fun and telling them where to eat and this place and that place, it works for them. They become more friends than guests and that's why they come back.\n\n\"We're just an every day, normal bed and breakfast in Scarborough. Yes, we offer fantastic services and everything like that but we're in a Victorian house with small rooms and small bathrooms. We're not the Ritz. We're not the Savoy. We are what we are but we love what we do.\"\n\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Greatest Hits Radio app."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Monday, drifting downward after recent recovery over the weekend. During the last month, bitcoin has primarily been in consolidation mode. Health of the global economy is likely to guide the investors' sentiments in the near term.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was drifting downward once again after weekend recovery as the largest crypto token dropped 2 per cent to remain below $27,000-mark. Its largest peer Ethereum was also down about a per cent but managed to hold $1,800-levels. Other altcoins were in deep red.\n\n\n\nBitcoin traded at the $27,000 level over the weekend, however, it has since been down as the market prepares for a news-heavy week in the US Investors and traders should closely monitor these events as they could potentially influence the market sentiment. We might see some volatility in the market this week, said Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin is currently trading at the $26,650 level, with its support at $26,200 and resistance at $27,000. On the other hand, Ethereum is trading at the $1,800 level. If buyers can hold the price above the current level, there is a possibility to see a short rise,\" he added.\n\n\n\nAll the top crypto tokens, including stablecoins, were trading lower on Monday. Solana dropped over 3 per cent, while Tron, Dogecoin and Polygon posted similar cuts during the early hours. Shiba Inu, XRP, Avalanche and Polkadot declined 2 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower, falling down to $1.12 trillion-mark as it dropped almost 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes jumped more than 22 per cent to $21.30 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin miners sold 2,000 coins worth $55 million in 24 hours as investors focus on a key support level for a potential bounce, said Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO at Unocoin.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nBNB (BNB), has declined by almost 1.5% over the last 24 hours. Despite the continued fall over the last few days, BNB may not have found the local bottom yet, at $300. The asset is trading in an \u2018Descending Channel\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price has continued to hold above the 200-day MA, but has failed to breach the 100-day MA at $315 which acts as a pivotal resistance point and a break above this could lead towards $330 levels. On the other hand, $290 serves as a support level with the $265 zone providing the final line of defence, beyond which BNB might experience a sharp decline. The RSI slope continues to slump towards the oversold zone reflecting an increase in the underlying bearishness.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $290, $265\n\nResistance: $315, $330\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Microsoft & Goldman Sachs Partner In Blockchain, XRP (XRP) And BNB (BNB) Outpaced By The Rapid Growth of TMS ... - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "It is a widely acknowledged fact that the blockchain industry is an ever-expanding industry because of its versatility and relevance across industries. Exploring this potential, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs have announced a partnership within the blockchain industry where they hope to utilize the benefits to meet the growing needs of their communities.\n\nA synergy such as this is expected to improve the general outlook of the crypto market. However, XRP (XRP) and BNB (BNB) have failed to thrive despite this partnership, and TMS Network (TMSN) has outpaced the duo in the market.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN)\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) is a layer 2 network built on Ethereum. As a user-centric platform, TMS Network (TMSN) addresses the problems users experience with other networks. On TMS Network (TMSN), users are privileged to trade different commodities, including cryptocurrencies, CFDs, FX, and equities.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAdditionally, to assist traders in making savvy trading decisions, TMS Network (TMSN) will offer social trading options where traders can imitate the trade of other successful and experienced traders. Complementing this on the TMS Network (TMSN) is the availability of trading bots that automate and execute trading strategies.\n\nSince the start of its presale in 2023, TMS Network (TMSN) has thrived and recorded groundbreaking numbers. At the commencement of its presale, TMS Network (TMSN) traded at $0.0038, from which it made a stunning move to $0.046. Currently, TMS Network (TMSN) is trading at $0.088, a 1700% increase alongside $5.6 million in profit.\n\nXRP (XRP)\n\nXRP (XRP), an open-source permission less and decentralized network launched in 2021. As part of its offerings, XRP (XRP) offers cheap transactions, speedy transactions, and scalability. The purpose of XRP (XRP) is to operate as a settlement layer for the Ripple network, making transactions easier.\n\nExamining XRP\u2019s (XRP) price movement, XRP (XRP) has consistently fluctuated in the market. XRP (XRP) started the year trading as low as $0.36, from which it stunned the crypto space by going as high as $0.56. XRP (XRP) declined from this point to trade at $0.44, its current price.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAlthough currently trading higher than its year-opening price, XRP (XRP) has been unable to record a significant increase in the value of its token. Comparing TMS Network (TMSN) to XRP (XRP), the latter has greatly been outpaced by the former\u2019s 1700% increase, with the latter struggling to muster a 50% increase.\n\nBNB (BNB)\n\nLaunched on the BSC Network, BNB (BNB) is the native token of the A-list cryptocurrency exchange Binance. BNB (BNB) debuted on the Ethereum blockchain until it created its L1 blockchain. In a bid to improve its price, BNB (BNB) has been made deflationary with a quarterly scheduled coin burn. One of the focuses of the Binance network via BNB (BNB) is to provide a cheap and seamless transaction experience.\n\nTaking a look at BNB\u2019s (BNB) price stat, although it has appreciated, it is still unable to make a statement in the market. At the beginning of 2023, BNB (BNB) traded around $270, from which it began to climb steadily, going as high as $345. However, BNB (BNB) could not sustain this price which saw BNB (BNB) drop to $312.\n\nAlthough trading at a higher value compared to its year-opening value, BNB (BNB) has been outperformed by TMS Network (TMSN). Within this period, TMS Network (TMSN) broke a new price recording $ 5.6 million in profit while BNB (BNB) noted an insignificant push as it could not benefit from Microsoft and Goldman Sach\u2019s entry into the blockchain world.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile BNB (BNB) and XRP (XRP) may benefit from Microsoft\u2019s partnership with Goldman Sachs in the future, it is not a given. TMS Network (TMSN), on the other hand, seems to be pulling far ahead of its peers, even during its presale event. Savvy investors should purchase tokens during TMS Network\u2019s (TMSN) presale to get what could be the best token prices ever for this up-and-coming platform.\n\nYou can find out more about TMS Network\u2019s presale at the following links:\n\nPresale\n\nWhitepaper\n\nWebsite\n\nTelegram\n\nDiscord"

        "title": "Pepe The Frog ($PEPE) surpasses Dogecoin - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The memecoin inspired by Pepe The Frog is performing better than Dogecoin, the meme crypto par excellence.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, PEPE has recorded $227K in volumes against DOGE\u2019s $168K.\n\nPepe the Frog surpasses DOGE\u2019s doggie in trading volumes\n\nThe current 68th crypto by market capitalization is Pepe The Frog \u2013 $PEPE \u2013 the frog meme coin that has been climbing CoinMarketCap\u2019s rankings since its market launch.\n\nAnd indeed, PEPE is giving its investors some considerable gains. PEPE\u2019s price went from an all-time low of $0.000002764 on 17 April 2023, to an all-time high of $0.000004354 on 5 May 2023. At the time of writing, PEPE has fallen to $0.000001544.\n\nIts market cap also had the same surges, remaining at the time of writing at $605,000, up 560% from a month ago.\n\nSeeing these results of PEPE, it is easy to compare it with the meme crypto par excellence, Dogecoin (DOGE), in 8th position by market capitalization.\n\nDOGE has experienced a dump in its price over the past month of almost 10%, from $0.079 to the current $0.071. At the time of writing, DOGE\u2019s market cap is $9.9 million.\n\nJust like price and market cap, the trading volume of the two crypto memes over the past 24 hours also sees Pepe The Frog perform better than DOGE. And indeed, while PEPE records $227 thousand in volume, DOGE only $168 thousand.\n\nPepe The Frog: Elon Musk puts Dogecoin aside\n\nEven Elon Musk, who is a strong supporter of DOGE to the point that in early April he replaced Twitter\u2019s logo, the little blue bird, with Dogecoin\u2019s dog, now appreciates Pepe The Frog.\n\nIn fact, Musk wanted to use frog memes to joke about the expressions that come up when constitutional amendments are shared.\n\nExplaining Constitutional Amendments pic.twitter.com/oYkMPBe9Zi \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2023\n\nThis tweet doesn\u2019t mean much on a crypto level, except that the big DOGE influencer is free to use as many memes as he wants on his Twitter profile, which is followed by more than 140 million followers.\n\nIn any case, this remark by Musk underscores how much Pepe The Frog is riding the wave of the moment for so many investors.\n\nThe Pepe The Frog memecoin featured on Ethereum, BNB Chain and Arbitrum\n\nOn Friday, Pepe announced that he is present on three blockchains: Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum.\n\nOmnipresent Pepe\n\n\n\nintroducing our new bridge, powered by @layerzero_labs\n\n\n\nyou can now freely transfer your $pepe across the Ethereum, BNB, and Arbitrum networks pic.twitter.com/VMKI8yFmYj \u2014 Pepe (@pepecoineth) May 18, 2023\n\nThe new bridge that enables PEPE transfer across the three blockchains is powered by LayerZero\u2018s omnichain interoperability protocol.\n\nNot only that, in addition to traveling across multiple blockchains, Pepe The Frog also continues to conquer more and more crypto-exchanges. The latest on the list was Kraken last Tuesday. Here\u2019s the announcement on Twitter:\n\nThe project behind the crypto meme of the moment\n\nPepe The Frog is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum launched in the market on 14 April 2023, which aims to be the answer to dog coin memes.\n\nIn essence, Pepe is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. Moreover, the project has no formal team or development roadmap. Most importantly, Pepe has no whitepaper to support it, only its smart contract and official website.\n\nThis suggests that the only motive that has won so many people to invest in PEPE is entirely speculative. And indeed, the token is the very project of Pepe, and there are no other uses for it.\n\nIts tokenomics present nothing special, except that there are 420.690 billion PEPE tokens, almost all of which have been put in the LP on Uniswap, except for a 6.9% that is in the hands of the central wallet to pay for any listings on exchanges.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s allegations have not fazed investors\n\nRecently, crypto-exchange Coinbase wanted to inform its customers in a newsletter its thoughts about Pepe, calling him a \u201csymbol of hate.\u201d\n\nThis action was met with much controversy from the crypto-community, so much so that some supporters and holders of the meme coin, asked the crypto-exchange to apologize.\n\nNot only that, some of them were outraged to the point of transferring their funds from Coinbase to other crypto-trading platforms.\n\nThen, for a limited time, the hashtag #deletecoinbase also circulated, which within 2 hours of its creation, had seen over 14,000 tweets generated.\n\nThis event supported Uniswap\u2019s DEX, which, by supporting PEPE, is performing better than Coinbase in terms of daily trading volumes."

        "title": "Ethlas: Redefining Web3 Gaming with an Integrated Ecosystem | KrASIA - KrASIA",
        "content": "Most gamers can attest to the grind of building up enough experience points, currency, and unique items in a game \u2014 one that takes hours, if not days, of your time. When you decide to try out a new game, however, you\u2019ll have to start all over again as a beginner. But what if it were possible to transfer over all of this progress that you\u2019ve worked so hard to obtain?\n\nThis is just one of the pain points of Web2 gaming that Ethlas wants to solve with its integrated ecosystem. With a track record of developing over 30 games across various genres and accumulating over 15 million gameplays, Ethlas possesses the expertise to shape the future of gaming.\n\nLaying the foundation for a new gaming experience\n\nEthlas has a core team of members hailing from companies like Grab and Google, and they bring their experience in scaling apps and understanding user preferences to the Web3 space. Their CEO and co-founder, Wui Ngiap Foo, was the former head of technology at Grab Holdings. He now leads a team of 20 passionate game builders spanning Singapore, the Philippines and the United States.\n\nEthlas aims to build a comprehensive ecosystem by leveraging the shared infrastructure elements across its existing portfolio of games. Eventually, they want to be the platform of choice for both gamers and developers to create and explore a wide variety of immersive experiences, while seamlessly integrating with the blockchain technology and the benefits it offers.\n\nThe company has also garnered support from venture capital firms that see the value and growth potential of Web3 gaming, having raised a total of USD 8.7 million in seed funding from lead investors like Sequoia, Dragonfly Capital, Makers Fund, and executives from CoinMarketCap and Coinbase.\n\nMaking Web3 games more accessible\n\nOne of the major barriers to entry for any Web3 game is the need for a non-custodial wallet like MetaMask to create an account and save the gamer\u2019s progress. Ethlas has developed a Hybrid Authentication Infrastructure that provides users with the familiarity oftraditional social logins like Google or Facebook and combines it with the security and interoperability of blockchain technology, without needing to own a non-custodial wallet.\n\nThis innovative approach makes the onboarding process seamless and user-friendly, ensuring that everyone can dive into the Web3 gaming realm.\n\nAnother common problem with Web3 games is that users need to pay gas fees to the blockchain for every in-game action, and depending on the congestion of the network, these transactions may be costly and take time to process. Both of these factors could lead to a frustrating user experience.\n\nZero-knowledge (zk) rollups have gained traction by offering cheaper transactions via the bundling of transactions outside the main chain. Adopting similar architecture, EthlasPay \u2014 a cloud-powered blockchain payment solution \u2014 aggregates transactions on the cloud and then reconciles them on the blockchain, making the gaming experience much smoother.\n\nProviding games across more than one crypto network\n\nEthlas has expanded beyond the Polygon network through its partnership with LayerZero, a cross-chain communication protocol. This enables them to integrate games that are native to other EVM-compatible networks, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and the BNB Smart Chain.\n\nMoreover, they have found a novel method of facilitating the interaction of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from different collections. By partnering with prominent projects like Doodles and DeFi Kingdoms, Ethlas offers users the opportunity to utilize their NFTs as playable characters within the Battle Showdown game. This player versus player (PvP) mode combines elements from MapleStory and Super Mario Smash Bros. and allows players from different communities to engage with one another.\n\nMaking Web3 gaming more secure\n\nWith the ever-present risk of hacks in the Web3 landscape, new users may fear that their funds can get stolen at any time. Liquidity pools are a prime target due to the huge amount of funds that are locked up, and hackers draining these pools could result in the loss in value of gamers\u2019 Web3 assets.\n\nEthlas provides a multi-layered approach to monitor and detect any bots or fraudulent users that attempt any malicious transactions. This robust security approach is further enhanced through their close collaboration with GrabDefence, which adds proactive measures to prevent unauthorized cashouts by these users.\n\nGamifying experiences for mass adoption\n\nEthlas has transformed the topic of options trading \u2014 which can sometimes be really technical \u2014 into a gamified educational experience with their PokPok DeFi infrastructure. This empowers gamers of any skill level to learn more about the DeFi space and be more comfortable with using the ecosystem.\n\nAs more gamers transition from Web2 to Web3, the entire industry is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Ethlas is set to take advantage of this by providing a user-friendly route to the world of Web3 gaming for both gamers and developers.\n\nThis article was brought to you in partnership with Ethlas. To learn more about Ethlas and their vision for the future of Web3 gaming, follow them on Twitter and Discord, or visit their website for more information."
