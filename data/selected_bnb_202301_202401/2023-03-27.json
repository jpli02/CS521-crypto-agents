        "title": "Decentralized Stablecoins: Introducing HAY and Why It's a Great Asset for the Crypto Landscape - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "BNB\n\nRecent industry events have once more highlighted why the industry needs decentralized stablecoins.\n\nStablecoins have emerged as a popular tool for traders and investors in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Often pegged to a stable asset, usually the US dollar, they are designed to maintain a stable value as they allow crypto investors to trade in and out of different coins quickly without the need to convert to fiat. Stablecoins have gained immense popularity as they offer a stable alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, recent events in the DeFi space have once more highlighted the need for decentralization in stablecoins.\n\nEarlier in February, Paxos ceased the issuance of new BUSD tokens as directed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), causing an uproar as investors rushed to redeem their BUSD for other stablecoins. In addition, the recent Silicon Valley Bank collapse resulted in a temporary USDC depeg below $0.90.\n\nThese incidents highlighted the risks associated with centralized stablecoins, as they are subject to the regulations and restrictions imposed by central authorities.\n\nDecentralized stablecoins, on the other hand, are designed to be free from centralized control. They are built on blockchain networks and operate through a decentralized system, which allows for greater transparency and security.\n\nBuilt on BNB Chain, Helio Protocol's HAY (BEP-20) solves the stablecoin trilemma of decentralization, capital efficiency, and safety. HAY is an overcollateralized \u201cdestablecoin\u201d backed by liquid staked BNB and is redeemable for 1 USD value of cryptocurrency.\n\nHelio Protocol\u2019s notion of \u201cDestablecoin\u201d represents a new asset class within the crypto space that seeks to appropriately label a new model in the current stablecoin landscape. The prefix \u201cde\u201d could often be misconstrued for price volatility as seen in regular cryptocurrencies. However, it stands for decentralized, clearly distinguishing products like HAY from legacy stablecoins such as USDC and BUSD which have centralized custodians. Destablecoins do not aim to achieve total price stability with the backing of fiat currencies, rather they utilize decentralized, liquid-staked crypto-assets as collateral. This helps mark the progression of the DeFi industry, as stablecoins progress from centralized to decentralized.\n\nHAY Use Cases\n\n1. Borrowing of HAY\n\nUsers who have deposited BNB on the Helio Protocol (CeVault) are eligible to borrow HAY.\n\nThe operations of borrowing HAY, repaying the loan (with interest), and withdrawing the original collaterals are all governed by a set of smart contracts.\n\n2. Liquidity Mining: Via 3rd party LPs on DEXes\n\n3. Payment: As means to transfer value and purchase goods & services.\n\nWhat is Helio Protocol?\u200b\n\nHelio Protocol is an open-source liquidity protocol for borrowing and earning yield on HAY - a new BNB-backed, over-collateralized destablecoin. Built on the BNB Chain, Helio Protocol consists of a dual-token model and mechanisms that support instant conversions, asset collateralization, borrowing, yield farming, and destablecoin staking. Helio Protocol aims to deliver an improved version of already successful stablecoin projects by further optimizing safety and capital efficiency. The protocol aims to achieve this by leveraging Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards, liquid staking, and yield-bearing assets.\n\nHelio smart contracts have notably undergone multiple external audits and security assessments from industry-leading security firms such as CertiK, SlowMist, PeckShield, and Veridise.\n\nHAY represents a significant step forward in the evolution of decentralized stablecoins. With its unique destablecoin model, overcollateralization, and liquid staking, HAY offers capital efficiency, safety, and decentralization in a single package. As the recent incidents involving centralized stablecoins demonstrate, decentralized stablecoins like HAY offer a more resilient and transparent alternative to traditional stablecoins. By prioritizing decentralization, transparency, and security, HAY is helping to create a more trustworthy and robust financial system in the crypto landscape.\n\nLearn more about Helio Protocol and HAY via the following links:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram | Medium"
