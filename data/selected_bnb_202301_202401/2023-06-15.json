        "content": "The layer-1 blockchain BNB Chain by the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange Binance on Thursday teases a major announcement coming on June 19.\n\nThe move comes after BNB Chain successfully implemented the Luban hard fork upgrade introducing fast finality, and enhancing security and transaction reliability.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBNB Chain Teases Layer-2 Blockchain Solution\n\nBNB Chain on its official Twitter account on June 15 posted a teaser video about the future of BNB Chain, unlocking the power of the chain.\n\nThe teaser video shows many clues, with a major hint of \u201cLayer 2 Blockchain Solution.\u201d The latest innovation is a high-performance Layer-2 Ecosystem, with high capacity and low-cost transaction processing. It also hints at a gas per second of 100 million.\n\nThe social media bio is also changed to \u201ca brand-new way to scale your project with BNB Chain.\u201d BNB Chain has asked users to make guesses about the reveal on June 19, as few clues are already mentioned in the teaser video.\n\nIt follows after BNB Chain completed the Luban network upgrade and hard fork. Luban hard fork incorporates three different Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Evolution Proposals (BEPs): BEP-126, BEP-174, and BEP-221. These aim to make the network faster and more secure.\n\nBEP-126 introduces Fast Finality, making block reorganizations almost impossible. In addition, it enhanced security against double-spend and MEV reorg attacks, irreversible transactions after confirmation, and efficient operations for crypto exchanges and DeFi protocols.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Community Alleges Prometheum\u2019s US SEC And FINRA Approval Is Controversial\n\nBNB Price Falls\n\nBNB price fell 6% in the last 24 hours and 12% in a week. The price is currently trading at $233, with the 24-hour low and high of $231 and $249, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has declined by 30% in the last 24hrs, indicating a decrease in interest.\n\nBNB price has been under pressure after the US SEC filed lawsuits against Binance, Binance.US, and CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao for fraud and violating securities laws. The BNB price is down 25% since then.\n\nAccording to a price analysis published by CoinGape Markets, BNB price is at risk of further fall.\n\nAlso Read: Tether (USDT) Depegs After Curve-Aave Loan Saga; Spooks Crypto Market"

(Photo: WWAY)\n\nWILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) \u2013A fire broke out overnight Wednesday at the historic Graystone Bed and Breakfast on the corner of south third and dock streets in downtown Wilmington.\n\nCrews blocked off 3rd street in downtown Wilmington from Market to Orange Streets as eyewitnesses watched one of Wilmington\u2019s oldest buildings go up in smoke.\n\nWilmington fire battalion Chief Patrick Campbell said they got the call around 10:30 p.m. Wednesday evening. After arriving at The Graystone Inn, crews could not identify the source of the smoke. Thinking it was an electrical short, multiple units left the scene. But shortly after, crews found a fire in the wall, and it quickly spread.\n\nThe building was then evacuated.\n\n\u201cWe ended up calling the second alarm in, and a third after that, \u201cChief Campbell said. \u201cEventually we got it put out, but it was on the edge of backing out and going to a defensive fire fight.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chief Campbell, the historic architecture of the building played a roll in the spread as the building has a \u2018balloon frame.\u2019 This type of construction doesn\u2019t have fire blocking between studs like modern construction does.\n\nTwo firefighters were injured, with one having burns on his leg that will need testing, and the other only minor burns. Both firefights are expected to make a full recovery.\n\nAs for the building, Chief Campbell says it\u2019s condition is unknown, but it look bleak.\n\n\u201cWell it doesn\u2019t feel good tonight, I can tell you that.\u201d\n\nWWAY can confirm that firefighters saved the original blueprint of the historic building, but the condition of the rest of the artifacts inside the building is still unknown.\n\n10:41 a.m. Update:\n\nThree firefighters were injured during the response, and were transported to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Fire crews cleared the scene around 9:00 a.m. Thursday morning.\n\nThe Fire Marshal\u2019s Office determined the fire started accidentally in the kitchen area.\n\nThe Preston Restaurant posted to its website Thursday, thanking the community for its support. The post states the restaurant is \u201cReopening Soon.\u201d"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nLatest on-chain data shows the Ripple network is expanding as the number of new XRP addresses increases.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these increases in addresses usually signal a potentially significant price growth.\n\nNetwork Growth (XRP). Source: Santiment\n\nIs XRP preparing for its next rally?\n\nAs reported by ZyCrypto, the surge in new addresses helped drive the price of XRP above the psychological resistance of $0.50, reaching a peak of $0.056 on Tuesday as the XRP Army continue to envison the $10 price point.\n\nAlthough the increase in addresses could be a bullish signal suggesting the next XRP rally, it\u2019s not a completely reliable indicator.\n\nInvestors focus on the outcome of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that XRP is a Security. Recently, District Judge Annalisa Torres ordered the inclusion of former SEC director William Hinman\u2019s speech in the case documents, where he stated that Ether is not a Security token.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of these documents is crucial for Ripple in the case, as it could help the company demonstrate that, like ETH, XRP is not a security token.\n\nAdditionally, a victory in the Ripple lawsuit could have significant implications for the price of XRP and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. According to several experts, Ripple and its token are undervalued, considering the company\u2019s reserves exceed four times its market value. Furthermore, Ripple has expressed its desire to go public, generating significant interest from institutional investors.\n\nXRP retreats 7.4%\n\nToday, the price of XRP experienced a 5.4% retreat, according to CoinGecko data, following the recent SEC lawsuit against Binance.US, Binance International, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. The lawsuit alleges that the exchange allowed North American users to use the international platform without regulatory permission to operate an unauthorized security token.\n\nFurthermore, they were accused of using unauthorised user funds, transferring them to other international entities, thus evading federal laws.\n\nHowever, despite the current decline of XRP, several indicators, such as moving averages, VPVP, and ADX, among others, continue to project a bullish trend on daily timeframes.\n\nTherefore, XRP needs to respect the support zone to maintain its bullish movement above $0.45. If it stays above that zone in the coming days, it could likely target the next resistance at $0.60 in the short term."

        "content": "Binance\u2019s native token, BNB, experienced a significant price drop, falling about 25% from June 5 to 12, reaching its lowest level since 2022.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Zhao Changpeng, accusing them of mismanaging client funds, misleading investors and regulators, and violating securities regulations. Binance pledged to defend its platform against these allegations.\n\nBinance CEO CZ denied allegations of market manipulation, including claims of selling bitcoin to stabilize the price of BNB. These allegations arose from market pundits and a technical analysis platform accusing Binance of manipulating the market through trades involving BTC, BNB, and Tether.\n\nThe price of the native token of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, has dropped, fueling fears among digital asset investors.\n\nBNB is up about 14% to $251 over the past two days, but the index of the top 100 coins is up significantly compared to Binance Token.\n\nThe token fell about 25% from June 5 to 12, its lowest level since 2022, trailing only U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Binance Holdings. It sued its founder, Zhao Changpeng, for violating rules.\n\nUS regulators have previously said BNB is one of many unregistered securities in the digital asset space. According to CoinGecko, the token has a market capitalization of $39 billion making him the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Users receive discounted transaction fees, and the success of the coin and Binance are believed to go hand in hand.\n\nBut while Binance\u2019s response to the SEC lawsuit helped stabilize BNB, it also poses risks the US Department of Justice may file charges\n\nRegulatory Challenges and Defence of Binance\n\nThe SEC has accused Binance and Zhao of mismanaging client funds, misleading investors and regulators, and violating securities regulations. Binance called the move \u201cdisappointing\u201d and said it would \u201cstrongly\u201d defend its platform.\n\nAfter the collapse of the FTT, investors are turning to native tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges. It is the token of FTX that contributed to the collapse of FTT. The cleanup also left the sector worried about the resilience of the exchange.\n\nIn addition, Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Chao denied allegations that Binance secretly sold bitcoin to artificially stabilize the price of the BNB token (BNB). The rumour comes from multiple market pundits, including analyst Dylan LeClair and Swan Bitcoin CEO Corey Cristen, who believe Binance intends to artificially inflate the value of BNB accused of manipulating the market.\n\nIn a tweet on June 13, CZ said Binance did not sell itself or BNB, saying that the crypto exchange still has a \u201cbag of FTX tokens\u201d (the native token of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX). \u2018, he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that from a price list with millions of distributors, you can see exactly who sold it. FUD,\u201d he added.\n\nCZ\u2019s post was a direct response to a June 14 post from technical analysis platform Skew, which accused Binance of manipulating the market through a series of trades involving BTC, BNB, and Tether.\n\nSince BNB\u2019s launch, the world\u2019s most popular crypto exchange has benefited from growing investor interest in the coin. BNB experienced a significant price surge in early 2021, attracting the attention of corporate investors.\n\nMeasures like BEP-95 have upgraded an already deflationary tokenomics to further deflate the BNB.\n\nAccording to the proposal, gas prices on Binance Smart Chain will be even cheaper as the network will consume a portion of the charges for further decentralization. Users prefer it because of the low fees and the abundance of lucrative meme coins in the ecosystem"
