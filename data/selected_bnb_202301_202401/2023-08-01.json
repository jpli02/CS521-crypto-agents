        "content": "The Binance coin price in four-time frame charts shows a bullish upswing under the influence of a rising channel pattern. For nearly two months, the coin price has been wobbling between the two parallel walking trendlines acting as dynamic resistance and support. The BNB price close to the bottom trendline shows a sign of a bullish reversal and potential for a sharp rally.\n\nAlso Read: BNB Price Trade Idea As Binance Bags Dubai\u2019s Major Exchange License\n\nadvertisement\n\nBinance Price Daily Chart\n\nA bullish crossover between the 20 and 100 EMA should lure more buyers into the market.\n\nA bullish pattern sets the BNB price for a 10% upswing\n\nThe intraday trading volume in the BNB coin is $596.5 Million, indicating a 17.5% loss\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nAmid the recent uncertainty in the crypto market, the BNB price showed a sideways action limited between the range of $245 to $234. This two weeks consolidation showed the formation of a bullish reversal pattern called inverted head and shoulder. With an intraday game of 1.62%, the altcoin price gave a bullish breakout from the pattern\u2019s neckline resistance.\n\nBy the press time, the Binance coin trades at $244 and tries to sustain above the breached trendline. If the buyers manage to hold this flipped support, the altcoin could prolong the recovery by 10% and reach the overhead trendline of the channel pattern.\n\nUntil the two trendlines remain intact, the Binance coin may linger in a sideways or slightly ascending trend.\n\nIs BNB Price Still Under Correction Threat?\n\nA look at the daily time frame chart shows the channel pattern is part of an inverted flag. This chart pattern is known to extend the downward trend upon the breakdown of its supported line. This crackdown will intensify the selling momentum and may plunge Binance coin to $220, followed by $200.\n\nExponential Moving Average: with the recent breakout, the BNB price also reclaimed a 200-day EMA obtaining an extra boost for the long traders.\n\nRelatives strength index: the daily RSI slope above 60% strong bullish momentum in action"

        "title": "Earn Sei (SEI) Tokens on Binance by Staking BNB, TUSD, and FDUSD - CoinCodex",
        "content": "The Binance cryptocurrency exchange has announced that Sei (SEI) will be the 36th project featured on its Launchpool platform. This means that eligible users (KYC is required) will be able to earn SEI tokens by staking BNB, TUSD, and/or FDUSD tokens.\n\nThe SEI farming period will begin on August 2, 2023, at 00:00 UTC and will last for a period of 30 days. The farming period will end on August 31 at 23:59 UTC. Sei will be listed on Binance on August 15 in trading pairs with BTC, USDT, and BNB.\n\nFarm SEI Tokens on Binance\n\nBinance plans to distribute 300 million SEI tokens through the Launchpool program. This allocation corresponds to 3% of the SEI token supply (10 billion tokens).\n\n240 million SEI tokens will be distributed to BNB stakers, 45,000,000 will go to TUSD stakers, and the remaining 15,000,000 will go to FDUSD stakers. The amount of SEI each user will receive will depend on two factors: the size of their stake in proportion to the size of the respective staking pool, as well as the staking duration.\n\nIn addition to revealing the SEI farming program on its Launchpool platform, Binance has also announced that it will list the SEI token in trading pairs against Bitcoin, USDT, and BNB. The exchange shared the announcement on X (formerly Twitter) as well.\n\nIt is worth noting that Sei is not the only Launchpool project Binance announced today. The exchange has started a 30-day-long Launchpool campaign for CyberConnect (CYBER) as well.\n\nWhat is Sei (SEI)?\n\nSei is a Layer 1 blockchain designed for the efficient trading of digital assets, operating as an open-source, versatile platform. The native utility token, SEI, serves various purposes, including paying for network fees, staking for providing network security, participating in governance, and acting as collateral for applications on the Sei blockchain.\n\nThe protocol's key components ensure high performance and user-friendly experiences. Twin-Turbo Consensus achieves rapid 400ms finality, outpacing other high-performance blockchains like Solana. Intelligent block propagation and optimistic block processing enhance response times. Single-slot finality and parallelization guarantee reorg resistance and lower transaction costs, respectively. Front-running prevention and native price oracles contribute to a more reliable trading environment.\n\nSei enables permissionless smart contracts deployment in Rust. The project has raised $35 million from three equity investment rounds, with 2 billion SEI tokens allocated to equity investors. As of August 1st, 2023, the total SEI supply is 10 billion, with 18% reserved for the token\u2019s circulating supply upon listing.\n\nHow to farm SEI tokens on Binance?\n\nIf you want to farm Sei tokens, you\u2019ll need to register an exchange account on Binance.\n\nCreate Binance Account\n\nPlease keep in mind that only users who complete an identity verification process with Binance are eligible to participate in Sei token farming on the Binance Launchpool platform.\n\nOnce your account is ready, you\u2019ll need some BNB, TUSD, and/or FDUSD tokens to participate. If you already own these tokens, you can deposit some to your Binance account. Otherwise, Binance offers different methods of buying these tokens with either crypto or fiat.\n\nAfter your account is verified and you have access to some BNB, TUSD, and/or FDUSD, navigate to the menu on the top side of the Binance interface and select \"Earn\". Then, go to \"Launchpad\".\n\nThen, scroll down to the \"Launchpool\" section, and you\u2019ll be able to find the available SEI farming pools. Depending on which tokens you want to stake, select the TUSD Pool, FDUSD Pool, or BNB Pool. Then, follow the instructions provided by the exchange. The following screenshot shows pools from a previous Launchpool project, as the pools for Sei are not available yet.\n\nBNB price jumps after the Launchpool announcements\n\nFollowing the Launchpool announcements for Sei and CyberConnect, the price of BNB, Binance\u2019s native crypto asset, grew from $239.1 to $245.7, a price increase of nearly +3% in the span of just a few hours."

The exchange shared the announcement on X (formerly Twitter) as well.\n\nBinance Launchpool is a great way to farm new tokens while taking on minimal risk. This is because users can choose to unstake their tokens at any time with no strings attached. However, keep in mind that the duration of the staking period determines the amount of tokens a user participating in a Launchpool program ultimately receives.\n\nIt is worth noting that CyberConnect is not the only Launchpool project Binance announced today. The exchange has started a 30-day long Sei (SEI) Launchpool campaign as well.\n\nWhat is CyberConnect (CYBER)?\n\nCyberConnect is a web3 social network that empowers developers to create social applications, giving users full control over their digital identity, content, connections, and interactions. CyberConnect seeks to challenge the profit-driven approach of traditional social media platforms by establishing a community-owned social network. It introduces the CYBER token for governance, voting on protocol improvements, and as a means of payment for CyberID and gas fees.\n\nThe platform comprises several essential components, including CyberAccount, a gasless user onboarding system; CyberGraph, a censorship-resistant contract for content and connections; and CyberNetwork, an efficient and scalable layer 2 network. With $25 million raised from private token sales and an additional $5.4 million from a public sale, the total CYBER token supply is 100 million, with approximately 11.04% expected to be in circulation upon listing.\n\nAccording to the team behind the project, CyberConnect aims to usher in the next era of hyper scalability for web3 social dApps while providing users with a familiar web2 social networking experience. It seeks to break free from centralized tech and offer users true ownership and control over their digital lives.\n\nHow to farm CYBER tokens on Binance?\n\nIf you want to farm CyberConnect tokens, the first thing you\u2019ll need is a Binance account.\n\nCreate Binance Account\n\nPlease keep in mind that only users who complete an identity verification process with Binance are eligible to participate in CyberConnect token farming on Binance Launchpool.\n\nOnce your account is ready, you\u2019ll need some BNB, TUSD or FDUSD tokens to stake.
