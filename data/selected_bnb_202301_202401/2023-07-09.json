However, over the last week, its price has dropped by 2.72%.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nA similar situation is on the daily time frame of Ethereum (ETH). As neither side has seized the initiative, ongoing consolidation in the narrow range of $1,850-$1,900 is the more likely scenario for the next week.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,868 at press time.\n\nBNB/USD\n\nThe rate of Binance Coin (BNB) has declined by 0.89% over the past 24 hours.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nOn the daily time frame, the rate of Binance Coin (BNB) is more bearish than bullish as the price is on the way to the support level at $228.4.

        "title": "Crypto Analyst Predicts Short Squeeze for Binance Coin (BNB) \u2013 But There\u2019s a Big Catch - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist is predicting a quick burst to the upside for Binance Coin (BNB), likely driven by bears who are betting that the utility token will see sustained downside price action.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Jack tells his 243,100 Twitter followers that BNB is likely due for a bounce as it trades close to its support at $230.\n\nAccording to the crypto strategist, BNB bears are piling into the fourth-largest altcoin by market cap, and they will likely serve as fuel for a short squeeze.\n\n\u201cRejection of supply yesterday, at range low, squeezes are opportunities for positioning so far, and shorting range low puts you at risk of getting squeezed. Lots of open interest piled up overnight with shorts paying a premium.\u201d\n\nA short squeeze happens when traders who borrow an asset at a certain price in hopes of selling it for lower to pocket the difference are forced to buy back the assets they borrowed as momentum moves against them, triggering further rallies.\n\nLooking at Jack\u2019s chart, he appears to predict that BNB will surge to $250 before correcting all the way back down to $230.\n\nThe chart also shows that BNB bulls will likely ignite several bounces at the support level before it eventually crumbles by July 17th.\n\nJack adds that BNB is likely setting up for a massive collapse toward the $120 level as it faces multiple issues across the globe.\n\n\u201cConsidering Binance regulatory pressure, withdrawal from a lengthening list of western countries, changes to rewards and card perks and/or discontinuation in a bunch of countries, legal costs and whatnot, how realistic does this feel to you?\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, BNB is trading for $236, suggesting a potential decrease of nearly 50% should it hit Jack\u2019s downside target.\n\nThe crypto analyst is also keeping a close watch on Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL). According to Jack, the Solana/Bitcoin pair (SOL/BTC) is likely due for a correction after respecting resistance at 0.0006936 BTC ($21.06).\n\n\u201cI think SOL vs. BTC has some retracing to do here to green. Retest that to see if that DeFi (decentralized finance) season everyone has been speaking about for a long time actually gets some legs.\u201d\n\nBased on the trader\u2019s chart, SOL/BTC could drop to its diagonal support at around 0.00056 BTC ($17), where it could either bounce or plunge all the way down to 0.0003858 BTC worth $11.71.\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $22.21.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The city with the biggest decline was Sevierville, Tennessee, which suffered a drop of 47.6%.
