        "content": "Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, recently finished its 7th batch of the LUNC burn by eliminating roughly 8.9 billion LUNC tokens from circulation. This event finally marked the formal reintroduction of Binance\u2019s LUNC burn mechanism to the Terra Classic community.\n\nBinance\u2019s Next LUNC Burn\n\nThe amount of tokens that were incinerated was based on the fees that were accumulated between November 30, 2022 and February 27, 2023. Prior to the burn, Binance exchanged all fees that had been collected in USDT, BUSD, or BNB into LUNC. To improve the burn implementation and to cut costs, the cryptocurrency exchange switched from weekly burn to monthly burn back in November. Currently, with a contribution of more than 50%, Binance is the largest burner of LUNC tokens in the crypto market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead More: Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023\n\nThe Terra community is now looking forward to the next major burn after the success of the first Binance LUNC burn, and judging by Binance\u2019s official announcement, the next burn might happen as early as April 2. This was first brought to light by prominent Terra Classic validator ClassyCrypto.\n\nTerra Classic (LUNC) Price Action\n\nThe overall amount of LUNC that has been burned up to this point is 48.5 billion tokens, however, the total amount of LUNC that is still in circulation is an enormous 5.9 trillion. The community\u2019s dire attempt to reduce the circulating supply has been met with much enthusiasm by other top exchanges as well, including the likes of KuCoin and OKX.\n\nMoreover, the recent LUNC burn performed by Binance not only reduced the supply but also resulted in a modest price increase of the token. According to market data, LUNC recorded gains of over 4% in light of the news and therefore a continuation of this trend is being anticipated with the second burn scheduled on April 2.\n\nAs things currently stand, the price of LUNC is trading at $0.00014522 which represents a decrease of 3.99% over the past 24 hours, in contrast to a drop of 9.12% over the last seven days, according to Coingape\u2019s crypto market tracker.\n\nAlso Read: Popular Analyst Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) Price Might Hit $19K Soon"

However, Fountain Cottage Caf\u00e9 and Bed and Breakfast in Bellingham hasn't had the easiest start, it opened in January 2020 and was closed again in a matter of months due to the national lockdown - and with the cost of living and energy crises, Danielle says that they \"haven't had a normal year yet.\"\n\nDespite that, they've won Caf\u00e9 of the Year for Northumberland and Tyne and Wear at England's Business Awards for the past two years, and have been nominated this year too. And an appearance on Channel 4 daytime hit Four in a Bed could give a further boost in helping them to capitalise on the increasing number of tourists who visit Northumberland National Park.\n\nRead more: Gateshead hotel to feature in Four In A Bed from Monday and it promises to be a laugh\n\nAs well as the National Park on the doorstep, the village is home to a woodland walk that leads to a waterfall named one of the most beautiful in the UK, Hareshaw Linn. Danielle said: \"We love the location, especially in summer, as it's a lot busier than the winter.\n\n\"We get a lot of different kinds of customers coming through, there are walkers, cyclists and families coming through on their holidays, and day trippers coming to the village too. We've made quite a few friends of regular customers who keep coming back once or twice a year too.\"\n\n(Image: Daniel Hall/Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nIt's not the first time this corner of England's most northerly county has been showcased on the popular daytime TV show. Guest house Crackin' View in Tarset just three miles from Bellingham saw its bookings rocket after it appeared on the show in February 2022, despite host Steve Turnbull dropping a \"clanger with a banger\" at breakfast.\n\nHowever, the Bellingham couple are remaining tight-lipped on any memorable moments that may occur. Danielle said: \"It depends what they edit, we don't know what they're going to put in.\"\n\nMichael echoed that, saying: \"There's that much you do over the two week process, it's trying to nail down something specific. We had a great time though, travelling to different parts of the country was really interesting, but it's really hard to pick out anything that we know will make the final cut.\"\n\nAnd with long and strenuous days of filming during the Easter holidays in 2022 condensed into five 30-minute episodes almost one year on, it's no wonder the couple are unsure of what will make it onto the show. Danielle said: \"The filming was very strenuous, it was tiring.\n\n\"But it was a good laugh, a lot of fun. The days are a lot longer than people realise!\"\n\n(Image: Handout - Fountain Cottage Cafe and B and B)\n\nDanielle and Michael can't reveal too much about the other guests, such as the names and locations of the other sites, but say that they got on with the other guests. Michael added: \"They were all just nervous like us, we didn't know what to anticipate at the start.\n\n\"Everybody thinks their own B and B is the best and that's why the show's a great success because you get everyone coming together with that.\"\n\nThough it's just the couple who appear on the show, they say they couldn't run Fountain Cottage without an \"excellent\" team. The six-room B and B was closed to guests during filming but said staff run it while Michael and Danielle were away at other sites.\n\nThe couple are planning a watch party when the show airs, with Michael saying: \"We're going to watch it altogether because as much as we're on the show, it's a massive team effort at the Fountain. We really love our team and hopefully that comes across in the show, so they're watching it with us so we can all have a laugh together.\"\n\n(Image: Handout - Fountain Cottage Cafe and B and B)\n\nNeither Michael nor Danielle have been on TV before, and Michael admits that they are feeling a little bit anxious at seeing themselves on screen. He finished: \"You know you've said a thousand things but you don't know what ten are going to make it on the screen.\n\n\"It's the unknown that makes me anxious! But we know that we had fun when we were doing it, we were happy with the process, and hopefully it'll be something that the viewers enjoy too.\"\n\nThe first episode of Four In A Bed, which features Fountain Cottage, will air on Monday March 13 and the remaining episodes will follow each evening until Friday March 17.
