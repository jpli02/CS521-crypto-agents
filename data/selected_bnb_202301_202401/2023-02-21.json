        "content": "A safe multi-chain bridge is an ideal solution to connect Arbitrum and Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain). Users can utilize MetaMask or a similar Web3 wallet with this approach. Using a web3 wallet, users can transfer stablecoins like USDC, USDT, or DAI from BNB to the Arbitrum network.\n\nRead more: How to Add Arbitrum to MetaMask In 2023\n\nArbitrum is an Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 scaling solution. The network uses Rollups to improve scalability. The project seeks to lower transaction costs while increasing the efficiency of smart contracts. Moreover, the network has several additional privacy-related features.\n\nHow to bridge Binance Smart Chain to Arbitrum?\n\nA secure multi-chain DEX like Synapse or Stargate Finance is an easy way to bridge BNB to Arbitrum. Additionally, Stargate Finance is more cost-effective and slippage-free for moving stable currencies from Binance to the Arbitrum network.\n\nThe steps to bridge the two networks are relatively simple.\n\nThe first step is to find a secure bridge. Once a bridge has been selected, users need to connect their MetaMask, or equivalent web3 wallet, to the bridge. Then, users must decide which token they wish to send from BNB Chain to Arbitrum. Put in the number of tokens to be transferred. Wait for a few minutes for tokens to appear on the Arbitrum Layer 2 network after confirming the transfer.\n\nSource: BuyBitcoinBank\n\nThe typical cost to bridge from Binance Smart Chain to Arbitrum using Stargate Finance is $10 (one way) for less than $1,000. Depending on network demand on the BSC chain, you might anticipate paying up to $25 per transaction for amounts exceeding $1,000. Nonetheless, this is far less expensive than competing solutions like the Synapse Protocol, which levies a 0.2% cost, or $25 for each $1,000 exchanged.\n\nBridging Binance Smart Chain to Arbitrum can help users take advantage of the inexpensive transaction costs, quick transaction times, and extensive ecosystem of the DeFi and NFT protocols on both chains."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nPooky, a gamified Web3 risk-free prediction app, announced via a press release that its Genesis NFT Collection is ready for minting starting on 28 February. The Genesis NFT collection will come with various levels of rarity, which correspond to the value of the NFTs.\n\nThe most valuable NFTs are scarce and have higher attributes that boost players\u2019 prediction strategies.\n\nApart from the in-game value of the non-fungible tokens, the 1,000 Genesis NFT collection will be counting on the experience and popularity of its collection designer to build additional momentum. The 3D studio designed the collection Serial Cut, whose impressive portfolio of high-profile clients includes Nike, Spotify, RedBull, Adobe, Diesel, Converse, and Facebook.\n\nA case of proper NFT timing\n\nAn interesting point to note is the impeccable timing of the minting period. A recent report shows that the NFT market is recovering as the trading volume in January hit a 7-month high.\n\nThe sales volume of NFTs increased by nearly 41% from the previous month, with the dollar value hitting approximately $997.5 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe soaring NFT sales volume is buoyed by the bullish momentum that engulfed the crypto market since the turn of the year.\n\nWith the market conditions as ripe as they are, this may be the right time for NFT collectors or Pooky\u2019s players to get in on the app\u2019s Genesis NFT collection.\n\nIn the future, the value of the Genesis NFT collection may be tied to Pooky\u2019s value proposition as a risk-free sports prediction app.\n\nBuilding the future of sports predictions\n\nThe crypto industry is keen on revolutionizing several, including sports predictions and betting.\n\nAccording to Pooky, \u201cpredicting on sports should be fun and rewarding not the reason to lose all your savings.\u201d The traditional sports prediction and betting industry is a multi-billion industry though the majority of regular punters lose their money.\n\nWith Pooky, the risk of losing money is very low while the upside potential is huge. It aims to attract a community of players through this offering. This also raises questions about how Pooky sustains its business if it focuses more on player rewards.\n\nThe Web3 prediction app has a business model consisting of two revenue streams. The first one is primary sales. Pooky issues collectible digital assets that can be traded freely. Secondly, Pooky is entitled to a 5% creator fee whenever its NFTs are traded.\n\nWhen it comes to player rewards, Pooky adopted a multi-token system. Players earn rewards in $POK, the app\u2019s native token, as well as MATIC, one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the world with a market cap of $12.8 billion at its current price of $1.47.\n\nPooky plans to launch another token \u2013 $TPK \u2013 in the future. The app\u2019s roadmap includes extending the sports its supports.\n\nCurrently, players can only bet on football, one of the most popular sports in the world. For reference, about 1.5 billion people around the world watched the FIFA 2022 World Cup Final match between Argentina and France.\n\nCan Pooky pull it off?\n\nThe big question is whether Pooky can pull it off in the long run. This is a legitimate concern given that more than 3,000 cryptocurrency projects that were listed on Coingecko in 2021 have failed.\n\nPooky will argue that it has what it takes to reach its goals as Claudio and Stefano Riff founded it, two brothers with extensive knowledge of current sports betting platforms and their shortcomings.\n\nMoreover, the project raised \u20ac3 million ($3.21 million) from pre-seed investors, including Claster Investments VC. And for the culture, Pooky can take pride in launching in November 2022, at the deep end of the brutal crypto winter. It takes great conviction to do so."
