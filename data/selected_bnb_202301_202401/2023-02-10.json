        "content": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 The rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock is just one sound that brings out the charm and ambiance inside a Tampa bed-and-breakfast.\n\nAptly named the Phantom History House, it is a home that partners Steve Blanchard and Tim Hinton have turned into a one-of-a-kind bed-and-breakfast experience.\n\nWhat You Need To Know Partners Steve Blanchard and Tim Hinton have opened a one-of-a-kind bed-and-breakfast experience in Tampa\n\n\n\nCalled the Phantom History House, they say the property is dedicated to all things mysterious and paranormal\n\n\n\nFor more information, visit the Phantom History House website\n\n\u201cWhen I was old enough to travel on my own, I would always go on a ghost tour to learn the history of wherever I was, because I absolutely love history,\u201d Blanchard said.\n\nThat love of history and the paranormal has sent him on more than a dozen ghosts tours around the United States, and even two in Ireland.\n\nHe later hosted several tours in the Tampa Bay area and even started his very own podcast in 2018, dedicated to all things mysterious and paranormal.\n\nBlanchard says that\u2019s what led to his and his partner\u2019s newest venture: Opening the Phantom History House Bed and Breakfast experience.\n\n\u201cI told my partner Tim that I always wanted to do a bed-and-breakfast with this paranormal theme, so then we started looking for the right location and we found it and here we are,\u201d Blanchard said.\n\nThe two transformed the house into what it is today, with no detail ignored. Most of the pieces in the house are items Steve and Tim found at antique stores.\n\nThey dedicated each room to something unique or paranormal.\n\nThe library room contains classic horror novels and ghost tales, while the sunroom offers guests a chance to try out a ouija board coffee table. Upstairs, they\u2019ve carefully crafted the rooms around spooky themes.\n\n\u201cWe want people to come here, and if they enjoy Halloween, if they enjoy the creepy factor, we want them to enjoy that,\u201d Blanchard said. \u201cBut we also want folks who may not be into that stuff to know we are a very comfortable stay. We like to say it\u2019s as creepy as you want it to be and we like everyone to be in on the fun.\u201d\n\nThe Phantom History House Bed and Breakfast experience is currently open and taking bookings. They\u2019re also working on setting up special events that will take place throughout the year. For more information, head to the Phantom History House website."

        "content": "Important information: This is a sponsored story. Please remember that the value of investments, and any income from them, can fall as well as rise so you could get back less than you invest. If you are unsure of the suitability of your investment please seek advice. Tax rules can change and the value of any benefits depends on individual circumstances. The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the sponsor\n\nThe Anti-Sandwich tool by DeFi security provider, Hackless, is offering a safe way of swapping crypto assets and avoiding them being \u2018sandwiched\u2019. The solution is available for both individual users and DeFi platforms that run on Ethereum or BNB Chain and wish to enhance their security level. Anti-Sandwich has already proved effective for a play-to-earn platform and is now open to a wider audience.\n\nWhat does Anti-Sandwich protect from?\n\nDecentralized exchanges are gaining momentum since they allow users to stay in control of their funds. Yet, this doesn\u2019t mean that these platforms are not vulnerable and face no risks of losing the funds of their users. Quite the opposite \u2013 recent data shows that they are still prone to hacks and exploits of different kinds. In 2022, the 10 largest exploits have seen $2.1B being stolen from crypto protocols.\n\nBoth DeFi protocols and individual users keep falling victim to skilful hackers who continuously invent sophisticated attacks and use new tactics to steal funds. Sandwich attacks are among such hacks. While this type of attack does not come up in the news too often, collective data shows quite alarming results of damage caused to unfortunate victims.\n\nBetween May 2020 and April 2022, a total of 457,691 sandwich attacks were detected with an average ROI above 4%, as calculated by a TarLogic report.\n\nThe newly introduced Anti-Sandwich tool helps fight these sandwich attacks on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain by avoiding public mempools through directly submitting transactions to miners. In reference to DEX, a mempool is a waiting area for transactions that haven\u2019t been added to a block and are still unconfirmed. These transactions are placed in a mempool that are then picked up by a miner who packages them into a block. It is also in a mempool that an exploiter can \u2018look\u2019 for transactions that need to be executed soon.\n\nEvery sandwich attack is performed in a few steps, which are as follows:\n\nAn attacker monitors the mempool to detect a high-value transaction.\n\nAn attacker buys a certain amount of the same token before a user\u2019s transaction is executed to pump the price.\n\nA user purchases the token at a higher price.\n\nAn attacker sells purchased assets at a higher price, pocketing the difference.\n\nIt takes only two transactions for an exploiter to earn quite a significant profit, stealing from unaware users.\n\nAnti-Sandwich for DeFi protocols\n\nThe first client of the Anti-Sandwich solution \u2013 a play-to-earn project \u2013 has already integrated the Hackless customized widget on their platform offering their users a few benefits already:\n\nImproved user experience, without the user ever leaving the platform for swapping a project token. Additionally, it averts any confusion with similar tokens among a myriad of currencies on DEXs.\n\nBoosted security while averting potential sandwich attacks during swaps.\n\nThe Anti-Sandwich tool boasts of fast and easy integration via the NPM library, as well as offers brand customization.\n\nAnti-Sandwich for every DeFi user\n\nIf you are a DeFi investor who wishes to avoid falling prey to sandwich attacks, you can make use of Anti-Sandwich by Hackless for individual users. The swapping widget is available on the project\u2019s website and is pretty straight-forward to use. It allows you to easily and safely swap cryptocurrencies in Ethereum and BSC networks by sending your transactions directly to miners. Since your transaction doesn\u2019t reach the mempool, it never becomes visible to hackers and as a result, has no risk of becoming a target.\n\nTo protect your transaction from being sandwiched, you simply need to:\n\nConnect your Metamask wallet.\n\nSelect the network and token that you wish to swap.\n\nSign the transaction. Once signed, it will automatically be submitted to private miners, avoiding the public mempool.\n\nAnti-Sandwich widget by Hackless\n\nDuring its beta version, Anti-Sandwich is completely free of charge to use and works for Ethereum and BNB Chain."

        "title": "Fawlty Towers: Torquay's real life Basil Fawlty can't wait for sitcom's return - Devon Live",
        "content": "Meet the 'real-life Basil Fawlty' running a bed and breakfast in Torquay who can't wait for the classic sitcom's return - and hopes it will significantly boost trade. Peter Bland, 55, has long been compared to the iconic John Cleese character and believes the revival of the iconic show could led to an influx of fresh bookings and a welcome boost in tourism for the seaside town.\n\nThe hospitality boss manages The Somerville with his wife Helen, also 55, in the same Devon coastal town where Fawlty Towers, which first hit screens in 1975, is set. And he says his \u201canti-woke\u201d views and mannerisms as a host have led many to describe him as a \"dead ringer for Basil.\"\n\nHe said: \u201cI think I do see myself as a Basil Fawlty character, not to the extent where Basil was rude to guests. But I like to think of myself as a bit of a character, anti-woke and all that sort of stuff. And I absolutely think the reboot will bring a few more people down to Torquay.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a demise of bed and breakfasts to Airbnb\u2019s, which to me are soleless holiday lets, and Torquay is swamped with holiday lets. But there is nothing nicer than being welcomed by the patron and his wife \u2013 although I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m allowed to say that anymore.\u201d\n\nRead More - Fawlty Towers set for revival with John Cleese and his daughter\n\nPeter became the owner of The Somerville seven years ago, after spending decades managing a pub with his wife Helen, who he met in culinary school. He said the reboot could only be a \u201cpositive\u201d for Torquay. And Peter said as an independent guest house owner, his life seemed to sometimes closely imitate sketches from the hilarious show, which also stared Connie Booth.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have a room that sort of looks out onto a wall, so what I actually did is have this great big mural printed of Torquay and had it glued on the wall opposite. There\u2019s that episode where an old and deaf lady walks into one of Fawlty\u2019s rooms and says, \u201cI booked a room with a view.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasil says, \u2018This does have a view of Torquay! What would you like to see from the room? Would you like to see wildebeest running over the plains?\u201d So when guests check in for that room, I always joke, \u2018Of course, you do have a sea view.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Brits get it, but some of my overseas guests from over Europe perhaps don\u2019t. Maybe that\u2019s just British humour.\"\n\nPeter says he\u2019s also happy to act as \u201ca private concierge\u201d to his patrons, who equally seem to suit the roles of guests in the BBC series thanks to their quirky personalities. And he said he was also particularly careful to roll out the red carpet for solo travellers in case they're hotel inspectors, just like Basil in the hit series.\n\nHe went on: \"When I first arrived, I had this absolute phobia that every single-person guest that came was the hotel inspector. I did exactly the same as Basil, and still do to this day, because it\u2019s a secret visit. The next morning, they'll show you a card and say, 'Hello, I\u2019m the AA hotel inspector.'\"\n\nHe added: \u201cI hate a breakfast room that is silent. So I like to get people speaking to each other and having a chat \u2013 and we speak about the world. Whether that\u2019s like Basil Fawlty, I don\u2019t know. Maybe it's just being a very good host.\u201d\n\nPeter said his guests also sometimes imitated the characters in the sitcom, recalling one particular lady who demanded silver service, which he was happy to provide. He said: \u201cShe was this lady from Surrey, and insisted on everybody knowing she was from Surrey to the extent that she asked another guest to move their car because it was \u2018her spot\u2019. But as the owner, I absolutely love that. Every afternoon she had tea up on the terrace, and I had to make it.\n\n\u201cNobody else was allowed to make it, and it had to be with this special tea that I was serving her. But it wasn\u2019t special tea at all. It was the tea that I served to all my guests. She was like a female 'colonel', but I thrive on that.\"\n\nPeter said the service he offered stood out from holiday lets as he and Helen were able to offer expert insights into what to do in their resort town. And he said he was still proud that his five-star rated establishment, which has eight art-deco-inspired rooms, was branded as a bed and breakfast, not a hotel.\n\nHe said: \u201cEssentially, I\u2019m a five-star hotel here. My rooms are outstanding. My public area is outstanding. But there\u2019s nowhere on any of my information that says this is a hotel \u2013 this is a bed and breakfast that looks after people.\n\n\u201cPeople come back from their day out, and I say \u2018How was your day? Do you fancy a glass of wine?\u2019 I hate a breakfast room that is silent. So I like to get people speaking to each other and having a chat \u2013 and we speak about the world. Whether that\u2019s like Basil Fawlty, I don\u2019t know. Maybe it's just being a very good host.\u201d\n\nRead next:"
