        "title": "Airbnb hosts will need planning permission to turn properties into short-term lets - Daily Mail",
        "content": "Airbnb hosts will have to obtain planning permission to turn their properties into short-term lets under plans to crack down on nuisance holiday rentals.\n\nThe problem has pushed local people out of \u2018cherished\u2019 towns and villages, said Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove.\n\nMinisters are deciding whether properties would need to be rented out in excess of 30, 60 or 90 days before they are considered to be holiday lets.\n\nIt is hoped the measures, if adopted, would stop individuals buying second homes with the primary intention of using them for short-term lets.\n\nThe changes would see a planning use class created for lets not used as a sole or main home.\n\nPictured: The Essex Stays retreat in Great Baddow. Residents in the village complained that they couldn't sleep because the guests were blaring music from a karaoke room. Rishi Sunak was forced to apologise for the inconvenience caused to pensioner Jeff Jones\n\nPictured: Interior of the Essex Stays retreat. The pub-turned-Airbnb comes complete with its own cocktail bar, where up to 20 people can stay for \u00a32,100-a-night\n\nLocal authorities would be able to opt out of using such controls, but councils in tourist hot spots such as Cornwall and Whitby are expected to take full advantage to stop residents being squeezed out of holiday towns. Mr Gove today publishes a consultation proposing the introduction of planning permission for an existing home to be used as an Airbnb or other short-term let.\n\nIt comes weeks after Rishi Sunak promised he would look at preventing Airbnbs being used as party houses and hubs of anti-social behaviour.\n\nThe changes would not apply retrospectively, meaning only hosts looking to enter the holiday let market would be affected, although privately ministers have not ruled out a future crackdown on all properties. Mr Gove said: \u2018Tourism brings many benefits to our economy but in too many communities we have seen local people pushed out of cherished towns, cities and villages by huge numbers of short-term lets.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m determined that we ensure more people have access to local homes at affordable prices and that we prioritise families desperate to rent or buy a home of their own close to where they work.\u2019\n\nPictured: Jacuzzi at the Essex Stays retreat. The owners pledged to a local newspaper in January this year that they wanted to 'minimise noise disturbance'\n\nSeparately, the Department for Culture has proposed a new registration scheme for such properties so ministers can get a full database of existing Airbnbs.\n\nCulture Secretary Lucy Frazer said: \u2018This new world of ultra-flexible short-term lets gives tourists more choice than ever before, but it should not come at the expense of local people being able to own their own home and stay local. The Government wants to help areas get the balance right and today we have an incomplete picture of the size and spread of our short-term lets market.\n\n\u2018This consultation on a national registration scheme will give us the data we need to assess the position and enable us to address the concerns communities face.\u2019\n\nThe changes are aimed at Airbnbs, meaning they would not hit hotels, hostels or B&Bs.\n\nThe number of holiday lets has soared since 2019, with listings in beauty spots such as the Lake District more than doubling in the past few years. Of the 30 neighbourhoods with the highest density of holiday rentals, analysis by The Times found 17 were in areas of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nLast month, residents in a village in Chelmsford, Essex, complained that they could not sleep because the guests were blaring out music from a karaoke room and soaking themselves in a hot tub late into the night.\n\nThe Essex Stays retreat in Great Baddow is a pub-turned-Airbnb, complete with its own cocktail bar, where up to 20 people can stay for \u00a32,100-a-night.\n\nMr Sunak was forced to apologise for the inconvenience caused to pensioner Jeff Jones, who confronted the Prime Minister about this noisy 'party house'.\n\nThe owners of Essex Stays did not respond to requests from MailOnline for comment last month.\n\nHowever, they pledged to a local newspaper in January this year that they wanted to 'minimise noise disturbance'."

        "title": "Binance Coin Price Prediction: Is BNB Next To Pump? - InvestingCube",
        "content": "Binance (BNB) coin price has shown a lot of strength in the ongoing crypto bear market. While other major altcoins are 70%-90% from their 2021 all-time highs, BNB price is only down 52.74%. This shows that the investor\u2019s faith in the Binance Exchange and Binance Smart Chain\u2019s ecosystem is still intact.\n\nBNB price is having a great week as it is up 3.84%. The recent breakout in Bitcoin price is one of the major catalysts behind the positive price action in altcoins. BTC price has broken above $30,000 in this week for the first time since June 2022. This has led to a rally in most cryptocurrencies, including Binance coin.\n\nBNB Price Remains Unfazed By The Fud\n\nUnlike most other crypto ecosystems with their own coins, Binance dedicates a portion of its profits to buying back and burning BNB every quarter. This leaves a positive effect on the Binance coin price by increasing its demand. The price of the cryptocurrency often increases close to its quarterly burn. The 23rd quarterly burn is bound to happen very soon, where around 2.2 million BNB will be taken off the markets.\n\nIn the past few months, there have been many controversies surrounding Binance involving regulatory issues and accusations against its CEO. Nevertheless, BNB has remained resilient amid all the FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). A major reason behind a loyal community of holders is the tranparancy efforts by the Binance CEO Chengpeng Zhao.\n\nBinance Coin Price Retests Major Resistance\n\nThe BNB price chart shows that the price has been trading within the $215-$336 accumulation range since May 2022. The bottom of this range acts as a support, and the top of this support acts as a resistance for the price. It is evident from the following chart that the price is currently on its way to retesting the range highs.\n\nBinance coin price prediction will flip extremely bullish if the price breaks above its $336 resistance. This might lead to a bigger push toward $400 level or even a higher price target. However, the broader market sentiment and the BTC price action will play a key role in this regard.\n\nI\u2019ll also keep posting my updated Binance Coin (BNB) analysis in my free Telegram group, which you\u2019re welcome to join."
