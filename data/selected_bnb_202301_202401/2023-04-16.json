        "title": "Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain: A month on, examining performance and metrics - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "-Uniswap v3 launched on the BNB chain generating high expectations.\n\n-TVL and active addresses showed an uptrend after launch, but MVRV has declined.\n\nExactly a month ago, the Uniswap V3 debuted on the BNB chain, generating high expectations for the decentralized exchange (DEX). But the question is- How has the platform performed since then, and what is its current state?\n\nRead Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nUniswap v3 lands on BNB chain\n\nIn February, a controversial proposal by 0x Plasma Labs to bring Uniswap version 3 (v3) to BNB Chain was approved by more than 55 million UNI token holders.\n\n0xPlasma Labs, a DeFi platform, first presented their plan to launch v3 on BNB Chain in December 2022. Uniswap governance approved the proposal on 22 January with 80% support.\n\n0xPlasma estimated that deploying v3 on BNB Chain would increase Uniswap\u2019s TVL by $1B. After months of internal conflict, the leading decentralized exchange went live on BNB Chain on 15 March.\n\nUniswap\u2019s v3 version introduced concentrated liquidity, a feature that greatly enhanced the efficiency of capital usage for DEXes.\n\nIn Uniswap v3, liquidity providers\u2019 positions are no longer interchangeable because they can now provide liquidity within specific price ranges.\n\nThis means that LP holdings in Uniswap v3 cannot be represented in the underlying protocol as ERC20 tokens, unlike in Uniswap v2.\n\nUniswap v3 volume and TVL post-BNB launch\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, an analysis of the Total Value Locked (TVL) and trading volume on Uniswap v3 revealed a surge in volume and a decrease in TVL leading up to the launch on BNB.\n\nOn 11 March, trading volume spiked to over $13 billion, while the TVL was around $2.5 billion. However, following the launch on the BNB chain, the TVL has been steadily increasing and was over $3 billion, at press time.\n\nActive user surges as MVRV declines\n\nExamining another on-chain metric of Uniswap v3, an upward trend was observed. The DefiLlama active user metric revealed that the number of active users on the platform had steadily grown.\n\nThe metric surpassed 155,000, which marked a substantial increase from the 50,000 figure recorded earlier in April.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 UNIs worth today\n\nOn the other hand, the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV) for UNI suggested that despite the positive on-chain metrics, the asset had not been performing well.\n\nAs of this writing, the MVRV was over -19.2%. The current state indicated that UNI was significantly undervalued at its present price range. However, it also suggested a possibility of a price correction to the upside."

        "title": "BNB Price prediction - Cardano (ADA) poised for major breakout, Collateral Network (COLT) surges 40% in - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) broke above $29,000, signaling altcoins have real room to run in the coming weeks. Analysts weigh in on Binance Coin (BNB) with bullish price predictions after it recovers from FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). They highlight signs of strength in Cardano (ADA) and call attention to a new lending protocol in Collateral Network (COLT), leading the charge in real-world assets in DeFi with a 35x growth prediction.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) Price Prediction\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) suffered massive FUD last week due to an encrypted tweet by Cobie- a famous online crypto personality. However, CZ, CEO of Binance, shrugged it off with his typical response \u20184\u2019.\n\nPrice predictions for Binance Coin (BNB) look strong, with a predicted range of $580 and $691 in 2024. A decent upwards move from Binance Coin\u2019s (BNB) price, at the time of writing, of $314.\n\nAnalysts remain confident in Binance Coin (BNB), stating its importance to the Binance Smart Chain, the second-largest DeFi ecosystem. The Binance Smart Chain executes millions of transactions daily, all requiring a gas fee payable in Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) launched in 2017 and has become vital to the ecosystem. Long-term holders of Binance Coin (BNB) have seen enormous profits from its ICO price of just $0.15, but investors who want to realize gains similar to the early days of Binance Coin (BNB) need to look to newer protocols such as Collateral Network (COLT).\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCardano (ADA) Shows Signs of Strength\n\nCardano (ADA) has been in a steady uptrend since early March, and on-chain data shows that Cardano (ADA) whales have been accumulating aggressively. A potential reason for this may be that Cardano (ADA) is regulatory compliant, and more institutional money is moving into crypto.\n\nCardano (ADA) was designed by Charles Hoskinson and launched in 2017. Cardano (ADA) recently launched its Blockchain Education Alpha Program, which has been circulating on Crypto Twitter, bringing attention back to this layer one.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish and forecast that Cardano (ADA) would trade between $0.71 and $0.86 in 2024, meaning a 2X from Cardano\u2019s (ADA) price, at the time of writing, of $0.39.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) Continues its Rally\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) has garnered attention across the crypto universe because it allows borrowers to unlock liquidity from real-world assets. The integration of real-world assets into DeFi has been highlighted as a critical growth area. It will enable DeFi to expand its utility offering to a broader market whilst bringing vast amounts of capital on-chain.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is a challenger lender disrupting the status quo and pushing the entire DeFi lending paradigm forwards. It is the world\u2019s first decentralized lending protocol for tangible off-chain assets.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) leverages a hybrid infrastructure model. It lets borrowers use assets like real estate, supercars and luxury watches on-chain through the use of 100% asset-backed NFTs, which are fractionalized to facilitate crowdlending\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) joins lenders, borrowers, tangible assets, and blockchain. Lenders can earn passive income by supplying liquidity. Borrowers can access capital from their assets without selling them, allowing them to take advantage of price appreciation. And all of this is powered by the COLT token which grants holders benefits like staking, governance rights and more.\n\nAnalysts have already forecast a 3,500% gain for the COLT token by the time the presale closes. This is likely only the preliminary rally before COLT launches on centralized exchanges, and early investors may see 100X on their initial investments.\n\n\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "How can investing in stablecoins mitigate market volatility? - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the popularity of cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed, with many investors looking to capitalize on the potential gains that come with investing in this asset class. However, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies can sometimes make them a risky investment, particularly during market turbulence. As a result, some investors have also started to turn to stablecoins during such times.Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a stable asset such as the US dollar . Investing in stablecoin can help mitigate market volatility because they are less susceptible to price fluctuations than other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum or any other.Stablecoins can mitigate market volatility to some extent.1.Investing in these can be a way for investors to hedge against volatility and reduce their risk exposure. By holding stablecoins, investors can protect their portfolios from sudden drops in the value of other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets, providing a haven during market turbulence.As stablecoins like Tether or USDC are pegged to a stable asset, their value remains stable. Therefore, if the value of Bitcoin or Ethereum drops suddenly, investors can move their funds into stablecoins to protect their portfolio from further losses. This strategy is known as \"hedging,\" which involves offsetting potential losses in one asset by investing in another asset that is expected to hold its value or appreciate.For instance, during the global pandemic in 2020, traditional markets experienced significant volatility, and investors turned to stablecoins to safeguard their investments. As a result, the demand for stablecoins surged, with Tether's market capitalization reaching $10 billion in 2020.Furthermore, stablecoins offer greater flexibility and convenience compared to traditional fiat currencies. Since stablecoins are digital assets, they can be quickly and easily transferred between wallets and exchanges, making them ideal for cross-border transactions. This is particularly useful for investors who want to take advantage of opportunities in other markets or avoid currency exchange fees and delays.Suppose you are an investor based in India who wants to invest in a startup based in Singapore. Traditionally, you would need to go through a lengthy process of converting your Indian Rupees to Singaporean Dollars, which can be expensive and time-consuming due to currency exchange fees and delays.However, with stablecoins such as USDC or Tether, you can easily transfer your funds to the Singaporean startup without going through the hassle of currency conversions. Since stablecoins are digital assets, you can quickly and easily transfer them between wallets and exchanges, providing greater flexibility and convenience.Moreover, using stablecoins can also help you take advantage of investment opportunities in other markets. For instance, if you see a promising investment opportunity in the United States, you can quickly transfer your funds to a US-based exchange using stablecoins and invest in the opportunity without having to worry about currency exchange fees and delays.Stablecoins can also be used for arbitrage trading, which is buying an asset in one market and selling it in another market for a higher price. Let's say that the price of Bitcoin is higher on Exchange A than it is on Exchange B. As an investor, you can buy Bitcoin on Exchange B using stablecoins and then transfer the Bitcoin to Exchange A to sell it at a higher price. Since stablecoins are pegged to a stable asset, you can quickly move funds between exchanges without worrying about price fluctuations.Despite the benefits of stablecoins, there are some risks associated with investing in them. For instance, stablecoins rely on the stability of the asset they are pegged to, and if that asset's value drops, it can have a ripple effect on the stability. Additionally, there have been concerns over the transparency and regulation of stablecoin issuers, which could lead to a loss of trust in the stablecoin and a subsequent drop in its value.While stablecoins can mitigate volatility to some extent and provide a safe haven for investors, it is important to carefully consider the potential risks before investing. Investors should also conduct due diligence and choose a reputable stablecoin issuer to minimize the risks associated with stablecoin investments."

Usually the congenial owner lives on the property.\n\nFor those interested in a first-time experience at an inn, or for people who prefer a stay at an inn, here are several scattered throughout Missouri and Illinois worth a visit. Each has been highly rated on the internet.\n\nRoom rates shown are the lowest offered throughout the year, but vary by type of room, day of the week and season.\n\nSchoolhouse Bed and Breakfast\n\nRocheport, Missouri\n\nOnce the school for students in the Missouri River port of Rocheport, the 1914-era building located midway between St. Louis and Kansas City is now a bed-and-breakfast inn.\n\nAs a result of the history of the inn, owners and innkeepers Chandrika Collins and Andy Hickman have adopted an appropriate motto for guests: \u201cStay in Class!\u201d\n\nNow listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the original schoolhouse was four classrooms for grades one through 12 through 1972.

Why not convert a few into bedrooms and invite guests!\n\nThat was the creative solution Wendy and Doug Needy took to open their very unusual bed-and-breakfast on their 14-acre farm near Sedalia. \u201cWe had eight silos when we purchased the farm,\u201d Wendy says. \u201cFive are still used for storing grain, but the others now have front doors, kitchenettes, living rooms and a second-story bedroom with a balcony railing made from hay rake wheels used to gather hay.\u201d\n\nAdd a herd of cattle, goats, chickens, sheep and other farm animals, and the unusual stay is almost complete. But, if that is not enough, fishing poles can be borrowed to fish in the pond outside the front door of the silos, and the wrap-around front porch on the main house is available for sitting and chatting with the Needys in the evening or before or after the hot country breakfast is served.\n\nMore info \u2022 thesilosatprairievale.com\n\nRates \u2022 From $135\n\nNearby \u2022 In addition to being the site of the yearly Missouri state fair, the nearby town of Sedalia offers a lot to see.\n\nThe Cottage Bed and Breakfast\n\nHermann, Missouri\n\nGuests sleep \u201clike a log\u201d in the three treehouses on the inn property, each perched in the forest canopy.

As a result, the five-suite Makanda Inn and three cabins were developed as an eco-friendly retreat in the heart of the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois. Tucked deep in the woods, the retreat is surrounded by nature, and includes a creek that gurgles through the property.\n\nBoth high- and low-tech methods for minimizing the impact on the environment were used in construction of the inn and cottages. Straw bales for sound and energy efficiency fill the walls, and earthen plaster, recycled plastic roofing materials and reclaimed wood for doors and roofing are all integrated throughout the inn. One cottage even features a living roof of native growing plants.\n\nAll rooms in the lodge and the cottages were designed from the bed outward, with views of the woods a paramount consideration.\n\nThe resort also features the work of several area artisans who handcrafted much of the furniture, created an enormous copper sun sculpture, and made custom-crafted doors and woodwork. Two cottages feature backsplashes made by Shauna Wellman from scrap tile, old broken dishes and whatever else she found for inspiration.\n\nBreakfasts are included in the room rates for the inn, and specially made dinners can be ordered.\n\nMore info \u2022 makandainn.com\n\nRates \u2022 From $149\n\nNearby \u2022 Dating to the late 1800s, the Makanda Boardwalk contains an eclectic collection of boutiques and artisan shops. Giant City State Park and the Cache River State Natural Area offer opportunities for hiking and horseback riding.\n\nHarpole\u2019s Heartland Lodge\n\nNebo, Illinois\n\nGary Harpole\u2019s happy recollections of visiting his Centennial family farm led to him returning to the acreage after college. \u201cHe wanted to have dogs, horses and the freedom found in the country,\u201d says Gary\u2019s mother, Wanda.\n\nThen Gary had the idea to develop the land into a retreat for others to enjoy. \u201cIf Colorado can use its mountains and Florida its beaches, we can use the resources that we have in Pike County,\u201d he said, and he proceeded to build.\n\nA 9,500 square foot Heartland Lodge was constructed in 1995 on 1,200 acres, and the 10,000 square foot Prairie Ridge Lodge was added in 2005. The 10,100 square foot Sunset Valley Lodge was constructed in 2014, followed by the Heavenly View Cabin in 2015.

Tucked deep in the woods, the retreat is surrounded by nature, and includes a creek that gurgles through the property.\n\nBoth high- and low-tech methods for minimizing the impact on the environment were used in construction of the inn and cottages. Straw bales for sound and energy efficiency fill the walls, and earthen plaster, recycled plastic roofing materials and reclaimed wood for doors and roofing are all integrated throughout the inn. One cottage even features a living roof of native growing plants.\n\nAll rooms in the lodge and the cottages were designed from the bed outward, with views of the woods a paramount consideration.\n\nThe resort also features the work of several area artisans who handcrafted much of the furniture, created an enormous copper sun sculpture, and made custom-crafted doors and woodwork.
