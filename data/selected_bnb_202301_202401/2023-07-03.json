        "title": "Binance Coin is Forming a Fake 'Bullish Pattern': Here's How - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "With the current market dynamics still somewhat bullish, altcoin investors are keeping a close eye on assets like Binance Coin. Now, long-term charts like the 12-hourly or daily time frame, usually conform to better trend direction. However, in this article, we will be looking at a present example, identifying a long-term trend, which lacks substance. Detecting such false setups is essential while dealing with a choppy market.\n\nAlso read: AI, Crypto Represents an \u2018Important\u2019 Opportunity for Web3: Coinbase\n\nBinance Coin\u2019s \u2018double bottom\u2019 underwater?\n\nDouble bottom is a technical setup representing a possible bullish scenario. The pattern observed on a long-term chart usually allows recovery of market sentiment for that particular asset. At press time, Binance Coin had a similar conundrum.\n\nAs observed, BNB confirmed the formation of a double bottom pattern on the 12-hourly chart. With a common resistance at around $255, the current scenario may lead to a 12% upswing to $285. However, before making those bullish bets, a further look into the micro picture illustrates the origin or completion of the pattern. It is also important to note that the pattern did not close above 50-EMA, which is bearish from a trend shift perspective.\n\n1-minute anomaly\n\nWhile minute charts are the least confirmatory time frames for any asset, it plays a critical role in understanding breakouts and trend deviation. For BNB, its 12-hour bullish pattern was invalidated in the 1-minute chart.\n\nWhen the micro time frame chart is analyzed, it is observed that the price candle which confirmed the pattern in the 12-hour chart, was a flash spike. Almost immediately, Binance Coin lost its valuation and it is currently threading under the initial value. While these are common during liquidity gaps or manipulation, the occurrence may have led to an illusion of a bullish structure.\n\nAlso read: Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval by SEC \u2018Fairly High\u2019: Bernstein\n\nTakeaway\n\nAt the moment, Binance Coin is the worst performer among the top 20 tokens, so its \u2018bullish signal\u2019 is fairly dismissive. However, the major takeaway from this event is that investors need to analyze all aspects of a trend shift before placing bullish or bearish bets. This is a prime example of fakeouts during turbulent periods, which often lead to massive futures contract liquidation."

        "content": "OnlyFans star Anna Paul made a shocking discovery in her Amsterdam bed and breakfast. Photo / TikTok, Anna Paul\n\nAn Australian OnlyFans star claims to have made an unpleasant discovery in her bed that made her skin crawl.\n\nContent creator Anna Paul was enjoying a trip around Europe with her mother who complained of a strange sensation, crawling along her neck and through the bedding.\n\nRecently checked into their bedsit on a trip to Amsterdam, the model took to TikTok to document their discovery. What she found in the sheets shocked and disgusted them.\n\nThe influencer said she thought \u201cshe was tripping\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen my mama lay down in bed last night, little bugs started crawling up her neck, they were crawling up her legs,\u201d said the 24-year-old influencer from Queensland.\n\nPaul went on to share a clip of the tiny, brown insects recorded on her mother\u2019s phone as they crawled over the white sheets.\n\n\u201cHopefully we get a refund.\u201d\n\nTaking to social media she asked followers what she can do to get rid of the little blighters.\n\nShe stripped the bed but wasn\u2019t sure they were gone, she said in the clip that has gained over 3 million views.\n\nWorried that they might have got into their luggage, which was open next to the bed, she despaired she may never get rid of the stowaways.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many of them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe BnB host, however, was nowhere to be seen. In the caption she claims to have been \u201cghosted\u201d.\n\nWhat to do about bed bugs in your hotel room\n\nBed bugs are able to hide in tiny crevices and fabric in luggage, clothing and linen. Arriving (and spreading) in the clothing of travellers, they are the number 1 enemy of hotels for their ability to cause an infestation, apparently out of nowhere.\n\nThe tiny, brown wingless insects normally only come out at night to feed and leave painful red bites on victims, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\u201cBed bug bites usually clear up without treatment in a week or two\u201d and \u201caren\u2019t known to spread disease, but they can cause an allergic reaction or a severe skin reaction in some people.\u201d\n\nBed bugs were reported by multiple passengers on Air India flights out of Newark, New Jersey. Photo / 123RF\n\nProfessional extermination is recommended.\n\nTravellers who suspect they have stayed in a room with bed bugs are advised to wash their clothes and luggage in hot water and, where possible, to tumble dry clothes on the hottest setting.\n\nThose who suspect bed bugs have gotten into their clothes or linen are urged to wash all of their potentially infected items in hot water and to dry on the hottest setting to kill the bugs.\n\n\u201cYou should have left,\u201d one comment advised Paul. \u201cIf the bed has bed bugs then the couch does too and your things probably have them now as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to throw your clothes away wash and dry with high heat and steam everything,\u201d wrote another.\n\nAnother comment claimed it took a year to be sure they had rid their belongings of the bugs."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSweden, G\u00f6taland, July 3rd, 2023, Chainwire\n\nOnyx Protocol is today announcing an exciting new partnership with MyCointainer and Earn Network. Through the initiative, Earn Network will offer enhanced staking opportunities on BNB Smart Chain and cheaper transaction fees for the XCN token. XCN holders can potentially get up to 40% APY on their tokens when staked.\n\nThe partnership with Earn Network will see Onyx launch dedicated decentralized staking pools for XCN on BNB Smart Chain. Each user will have the opportunity to stake their XCN tokens using two formal staking processes, Flexible or Locked.\n\nFlexible Staking describes a staking pool in which users can deposit and withdraw tokens at any time without any restrictions or lock-up periods. It offers flexibility and liquidity, with rewards distributed on a regular basis. Users can choose to compound their earnings by leaving their rewards in the pool or withdraw them.\n\nLocked staking, also known as fixed-term or time-locked staking, involves staking tokens for a specific lock-up period. Onyx will offer two options here: 15-day and 30-day set staking periods. Users cannot withdraw their staked tokens until the lock-up period expires. In return for committing their tokens for a longer duration, participants typically receive higher staking rewards compared to flexible staking.\n\nAll of the ETH fees collected for bridging XCN from ERC20 to BEP20 will be refunded as part of the ongoing gas refund initiative. Onyx recently published an in-depth bridging article and will presently share further details regarding the staking process via Earn Network.\n\nOnyx\u2019s partnership with MyCointainer will also see a dedicated profile dashboard launched. This will serve as a central hub for all Onyx-related products on the platform. Other products under development include wallet integration, facilitating deposits and withdrawals of XCN processed on BNB Smart Chain, and a staking mechanism based on smart contracts operated by Earn. This will enable XCN rewards on the platform for thousands of potential users.\n\nOnyx also intends to introduce 'Buy XCN with card' functionality, providing a MasterCard and Visa onramp for XCN, an XCN trading service offering pairs in EUR, USDT, and BTC, and extensive marketing activities. Keep an eye on the Onyx's socials for the latest updates!\n\nAbout Onyx Protocol\n\nOnyx Protocol represents a decentralized liquidity protocol that supports multiple token types with aggregated and unified capital access. This protocol solves the capital efficiency trilemma and eliminates the single points of failure inherent in centralized protocols. Unlike other lending protocols, Onyx Protocol offers transparency and trustless lending, making it a better choice for digital asset holders to access and earn liquidity.\n\nOfficial Website | Twitter | Discord | Telegram | Medium\n\nAbout Earn Network and MyCointainer\n\nEarn Network provides smart contract infrastructure to connect liquidity providers and pool creators in a completely non-custodial manner. MyCointainer's goal is to enable easy access to various rewarding crypto mechanisms for all. They want everyone to equally benefit from a changing financial landscape and speed up global crypto adoption.\n\nContact\n\nMr\n\nPaul Smith\n\nOnyx Protocol\n\ninfo@onyx.org\n\nDisclaimer: Press release sponsored by our commercial partners."
