Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe world's leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, announced the removal of several spot trading pairs from its platform, with 10 of these involving Binance Coin (BNB). The action comes amid an increasingly uncertain environment for the exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the announcement on June 12, 2023, the removal process will be executed in three waves on June 14, 2023. The first wave at 3:00 a.m. (UTC) includes pairs like DASH/BNB and ILV/BNB. The second wave at 6:00 a.m. (UTC) sees pairs like MC/BNB and MINA/BNB among the delisted. The third wave, scheduled for 8:00 a.m. (UTC), will wrap up the process with the removal of pairs, including PEOPLE/BNB and ZEC/BNB.\n\nThe decision to remove these trading pairs is particularly significant for BNB, the native token of Binance. This action comes on the heels of Binance's controversial update to its Terms of Service, which declared the exchange's authority to convert delisted cryptocurrencies to a different type at their discretion without notifying users in advance.\n\nBinance has assured users that they can still trade the affected assets using other available trading pairs on the platform. Nonetheless, this move raises questions about the future trading prospects for BNB on its home turf.\n\nSimultaneously, Binance has also alerted users of the cessation of its trading bots services for the aforementioned spot trading pairs. The exchange has advised users to update or cancel their trading bots to avoid potential losses.\n\nThis development is one among several recent changes in Binance's modus operandi. The company's tussle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of operating as an unauthorized exchange in the U.S. has only amplified the ambiguity around the exchange's operations."

        "title": "Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin slips below $26000; Ethereum holds $1700; Shiba Inu & BNB fall 5% each - Business Today",
        "content": "After the weekend hammering, Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were resilient on Monday amid regulatory challenges and liquidity issues. US regulators are on a warpath, going after major crypto exchanges and declaring a handful of major altcoins securities \u2013 a scarlet letter in crypto terms.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to remain under pressure as the largest crypto token was mildly up after the weekend jitters and traded below the $26,000 mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was down in red and dropped another per cent to remain below $1,750 levels. Action in the altcoin was majorly mixed.\n\n\n\nCrypto markets observed brisk selling pressure over the weekend amid the ongoing lawsuits by the SEC against Binance and Coinbase, which has led to a mass exodus of deposits in these exchanges, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"Amidst regulatory challenges and liquidity issues in the market, Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown some resilience. Bitcoin is trading around $25,700, continuing to hold its $25,000 psychological support as its dominance is nearing the 50 per cent mark for the first time since April 2021,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTop crypto tokens were trading mixed on Monday, but the move was majorly seen on the downside. Shiba Inu and BNB were down 5 per cent, each, while Solana declined more than 4 per cent. Avalanche shed 3 per cent. Among the gainers, Polygon gained 3 per cent, while Cardano and XRP were up over a per cent, each, after weekend dents.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower, falling to the $1.05 trillion mark as it shed less than half-a-per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes almost halved, falling more than 49 per cent to $26.6 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)is currently stressed after dropping below the $0.07 resistance level. It has declined by 15% on the weekly and is now trading near $0.06. DOGE has to break the 14-day moving average at $0.068, which could be a good sign for its mid-term trend and could signal a potential trend reversal.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the 14-day RSI (28.8 per cent) indicates an oversold sentiment. These values suggest a potential consolidation in the near term if the price continues to hold the $0.055 support level. If DOGE is unable to break through the $0.07 barrier, the price may continue to fall. Especially if altcoins continue to bleed post-US SEC action.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.055, $0.050\n\nResistance: $0.070, $0.080\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "The dump of the crypto Binance Coin (BNB) - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Binance Coin (BNB), the industry\u2019s most popular crypto exchange, has seen a -25% price dump in the past 7 days.\n\nA week in which it has been under indictment by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) and the 25% crypto price dump\n\nIt has been exactly since Sunday 4 June that Binance Coin (BNB), the cryptocurrency of the most popular crypto exchange in the industry, has been experiencing a price dump.\n\nSpecifically, in the past 7 days, the dump has been -25%, with the price of BNB dropping from $300 to the current $225.\n\nThis is a big loss for Binance\u2019s crypto, which with its more than $35 billion market capitalization (at the time of writing), continues to remain in fourth place in the overall rankings.\n\nBNB\u2019s present price is still lower than its price in November 2022, a time when the collapse of the FTX crypto-exchange had influenced the overall crypto market collapse.\n\nHowever, this is also due to the fact that now the main player, at least in the US, is Binance itself and its founder and CEO Changpeng CZ Zhao, who have been charged by the SEC with serious malfeasance and legal violations.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) and the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against the crypto-exchange\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint to Binance cited 13 different wrongdoings and included allegations very similar to those aimed at failed crypto-exchange FTX and its trading company Alameda Research.\n\nThese include commingling of corporate and customer activities, the misuse of customer funds, and the possible manipulation of the native token market.\n\nIn addition, regulators also said that Binance allegedly attracted US customers, despite the fact that it operated outside the country and was not registered in the US.\n\nThe SEC then allegedly asked the court for an order for \u201cverified\u201d hearings of the finances of Binance and Binance.US and then also for the freezing and repatriation of assets, preservation of relevant documents, and the appointment of a receiver for Binance\u2019s assets.\n\nHowever, these SEC allegations listed in a 136-page document do not convince the crypto community, which has also gathered on Twitter to defend and fight the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt) created by the US agency.\n\nBinance.US and the notice of suspension of USD deposits and withdrawals\n\nA few days ago, Binance.US also warned its crypto-community that it would have to suspend USD deposits, informing that starting tomorrow, withdrawals in US dollars will have to be suspended.\n\nThe SEC has taken to using extremely aggressive and intimidating tactics in its pursuit of an ideological campaign against the American digital asset industry. https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS and our business partners have not been spared in the use of these tactics, which has created\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rlIe6swIoY \u2014 Binance.US \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@BinanceUS) June 9, 2023\n\nIn that message, Binance.US called the SEC complaint and lawsuit its extremely aggressive and intimidating tactic in pursuing its ideological campaign against the US digital asset industry.\n\nIt then added that the two suspensions of deposits and withdrawals, only serve to protect its customers.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is not the only crypto experiencing price dumps: so are ADA, SOL, and MATIC\n\nLooking at the top 11 crypto assets by market capitalization, Binance Coin (BNB) does not appear to be the only one to record a -25% price dump in the past 7 days.\n\nAnd indeed, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) follow closely behind with these results, probably because they have been defined by the SEC as securities.\n\nIn essence, the SEC allegedly accused Brian Armstrong\u2019s company, Coinbase, of never registering its \u201cstaking-as-a-service,\u201d offering investors sales of unauthorized securities.\n\nPopping up on the list are SOL, ADA, and MATIC, along with FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO.\n\nIn this regard, the price of ADA, the seventh-largest crypto by market capitalization, fell from $0.37 to $0.22 last Saturday, while at the time of writing it is worth $0.27, a dump of -27% over the past 7 days.\n\nSOL and MATIC, on the other hand, recorded a -29% price dump in the last week. At the time of writing, SOL is worth $15.12 compared to $21.54 seven days ago, and MATIC has moved to be worth $0.63, up from $0.88 last week."

        "title": "BNB Whale Took Profit after Holding for Two Years - Tekedia",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrency, a whale is a term used to describe an individual or an entity that holds a large amount of a certain coin or token. Whales can have a significant impact on the market, as their actions can cause price movements, liquidity fluctuations and market sentiment shifts.\n\nIn a surprising move, a BNB whale who had been holding more than 1 million BNB tokens for over two years decided to sell them on June 10th, 2023. The whale, whose identity is unknown, dumped his entire stash on Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange and the issuer of BNB.\n\nAccording to data from Etherscan, the whale transferred 1,001,000 BNB from his wallet to Binance on June 10th at 12:34 UTC. At that time, the price of BNB was below $300, meaning that the whale cashed out over $300 million in one transaction. The whale\u2019s wallet address was first spotted by Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, on April 18, 2021. At that time, the whale had received 1 million BNB from Binance in a single transaction. Since then, he had only made two small transfers of 1,000 BNB each, one in May 2021 and another in January 2022.\n\nOne of the most prominent whales in the BNB ecosystem is the address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead, which is also known as the BNB burn address. This address is where Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange and the creator of BNB, sends a portion of its profits every quarter to reduce the total supply of BNB and increase its scarcity.\n\nThe sell-off caused a sharp drop in the price of BNB, which fell by more than 10% in a matter of minutes. The price recovered slightly after the initial shock but remained below $300 for the rest of the day. The whale\u2019s motive for selling his BNB is unclear, but some speculate that he might have been waiting for a peak in the market cycle to take profit. BNB had reached an all-time high of $686 on May 10th, 2021, but since then it had been fluctuating between $300 and $500.\n\nBNB is the native token of Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain, two blockchain platforms that support decentralized applications and smart contracts. BNB is also used to pay for fees and services on Binance, as well as to participate in various initiatives such as token sales and governance.\n\nThe whale\u2019s exit could have a significant impact on the BNB ecosystem, as it reduces the supply and demand of the token. It could also affect the confidence and sentiment of other BNB holders, who might follow suit and sell their tokens as well. The whale\u2019s decision to sell his BNB tokens after holding them for more than two years is puzzling, given that BNB has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the past year.\n\nBNB has risen by more than 1,000% since June 2020, when it was trading at around $4. It reached an all-time high of $686.31 on April 12, 2021, before correcting to its current level of $48.76. However, some analysts believe that the whale\u2019s sell-off could also create an opportunity for new investors to enter the market at a lower price. They argue that BNB still has a strong value proposition and growth potential, especially with the upcoming launch of Binance NFT, a platform for non-fungible tokens that will use BNB as its main currency.\n\nRelatively, Binance US, the American affiliate of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, has seen a significant drop in its trading volumes in recent months. According to data from CryptoCompare, spot trading volume on Binance US fell by 26% to $212 billion in June, the lowest level since November 2020. Derivatives trading volume also declined by 16.5% to $1.10 trillion, the lowest since December 2022. This trend reflects the overall decline in crypto trading activity across the industry, as well as the rising regulatory pressure on Binance in several jurisdictions.\n\nOne of the possible reasons for this decline is the increased regulatory scrutiny that Binance and its affiliates are facing in various jurisdictions. In June, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, accusing them of operating a \u201cweb of deception\u201d and violating U.S. securities laws. The SEC also asked a federal court to freeze Binance US\u2019s assets and appoint a receiver to oversee its operations.\n\nBinance US is not the only entity under fire from regulators. Binance itself has received warnings or notices from authorities in the UK, Japan, Canada, Thailand, Cayman Islands, and Singapore, among others, for offering unregisted digital assets on its platforms. The situation currently happening in the United States will determine how, what and where crypto assets can be traded within the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin inched up but continued to trade below US$26,000 on Monday afternoon in Asia, while all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, as investors brace for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) clampdown on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong legislator encourages Coinbase to set up shop in city under new crypto rules\n\nCryptos trade mixed\n\nBitcoin rose 0.21% to US$25,812 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost 3.82% in the last seven days following the U.S. SEC\u2019s lawsuits against two of the biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.\n\nEther, the second biggest cryptocurrency, fell 0.97% to US$1,736, after losing 7.31% over the past week.\n\nBNB, the native token of world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Binance, was the biggest loser in the last 24 hours, dropping 5.5% to US$224, and losing 25.59% on the week. Last week, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance, its U.S. branch, and Zhao with charges related to securities violations. Binance faces 13 charges in the lawsuit, including the unregistered offer and sale of the BNB and BUSD tokens and unregistered activity related to its Simple Earn and BNB Vault products and its staking program.\n\n\u201cThe SEC appears to have given no consideration to the drastic and cascading negative impact its actions may have on users and the industry,\u201d a Binance spokesperson said last week. \u201cWe now join a number of other crypto projects facing similarly misguided actions from the SEC and we will vigorously defend our business and the industry.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has also sued Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., on similar charges.\n\n\u201cWe are in this environment of regulation by enforcement. I don\u2019t feel like there is a clear rulebook. The only high-level statement they have made is that everything other than Bitcoin is a security, [and] that\u2019s just not what it says in the law, and by the way, that would also kind of mean like the end of the crypto industry in the U.S\u2026we have to go to court to challenge that and we are proud to do it for the industry and for America,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s co-founder and chief executive Brian Armstrong told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA and Polygon\u2019s Matic were the biggest gainers in the last 24 hours. Cardano rose 6.11% to US$0.2788, although it lost 25.72% on the week. Polygon increased 4.59% to US$0.6292 but declined 29.13% in the last seven days.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.25% to US$1.05 trillion and the total market volume fell 21.12% to US$27.29 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nNFT sales on Bitcoin network surge\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.71% to 2,999.94 in the 24 hours to 6.40 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 9.16%.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite lost 1.34% to 1,056.57 and declined 5.19% on the week.\n\nEthereum NFT sales dropped 11.75% to US$13.04 million in 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data. Bored Ape Yacht Club recorded the highest sales volume among NFTs in the Ethereum blockchain, rising 3.57% to US$1.46 million in 24 hours.\n\n\u201cThis has been an extremely rough week for crypto and NFTs due to the U.S. SEC filing lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase,\u201d according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cDuring this new phase of scrutiny on, well, everything on the blockchain, the NFT community has really banded together to support the builders.\u201d\n\nNFT sales on the Bitcoin network gained 42.14% to US$6.73 million. The Derps gained the most sales volume among NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, climbing 52.67% to US$4.61 million in 24 hours.\n\n\u201cBitcoin still holds onto number two and seems to be on auto-pilot. More traders are being onboarded into the Ordinals ecosystem as the appeal of taking part in the early days of the historic chain\u2019s NFT scene becomes too big to miss,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nAsian, European markets gain; U.S. futures rise\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equity markets mostly gained on Monday as investors await policy decisions this week from major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite dropped 0.08% and the Shenzhen Component Index rose 0.74%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index gained 0.07% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened 0.52%.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose as of 7.30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 0.09% and S&P 500 futures rose 0.28%. Nasdaq 100 Futures also gained 0.52%.\n\nThe U.S. is scheduled to release its latest consumer price index (CPI) data on Tuesday, a key inflation indicator. Annual inflation in the world\u2019s biggest economy is expected to fall to 4.1% in May, from 4.9% in April and 5% in March, mainly due to lower energy prices, according to Trading Economics.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to hold any increase in interest rates at its next meeting on June 13 and 14. Current interest rates in the U.S. are between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006, after 10 consecutive hikes that started in March 2022.\n\nEuropean bourses also strengthened on Monday. The benchmark STOXX 600 rose 0.31% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 gained 0.73%.\n\nThe European Central Bank is expected to raise its key interest rates by 25 basis points on June 15 and again in July, due to lingering inflation, according to a poll of 59 economists by Reuters.\n\n\u201cFixed income investors have experienced a period of very low interest rates over the past decade. Going forward, we are likely to see higher interest rates kept in place by central banks to control lingering inflation. In this new environment, corporate bonds can play a useful role in portfolios because different types of credit can be used at different stages of the economic cycle,\u201d Elizabeth Murphy, investment director of credit at Schroders, said in a note on Monday."
