        "title": "We Asked ChatGPT Which 5 Cryptos Will Survive in 10 Years: The Answer Might Surprise You - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Many crypto naysayers are heard arguing that most of the existing projects won\u2019t stand the test of time. And it\u2019s true that a lot of them haven\u2019t been existing for a long period. In the grand scheme of things, even Bitcoin is a baby.\n\nWith that said, we took the opportunity to talk to no other but ChatGPT itself \u2013 the AI language model that took the world by storm in the past few months.\n\nWe decided to ask which five cryptocurrencies will survive in the coming decade. The answer is somewhat interesting.\n\nBitcoin is no Surprise\n\nTo anyone following the cryptocurrency industry, it shouldn\u2019t come much as a surprise that Bitcoin took the first spot. ChatGPT argued that it\u2019s the first and most well-known cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin has established itself as a store of value and a medium of exchange. It has a significant network effect, widespread adoption, and strong brand recognition.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that there\u2019s a massive debate within the community about whether BTC serves as a good medium of exchange or an even better store of value. Both sides of it seem to be rather polarized, and it\u2019s a topic debated for a long while. ChatGPT seems to consider it to be both. That\u2019s cool.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s worth noting that the response also included a disclaimer:\n\nI can\u2019t predict the future with certainty, especially when it comes to the volatile cryptocurrency market.\n\nIt also clarified that its knowledge cutoff was in September 2021. This is what the top 10 (by market cap) looked like back then:\n\nNumber Two and Three Also Expected\n\nChatGPT argued that ETH and BNB will also stand the test of time. Commenting on Ethereum, it explained:\n\nEthereum\u2019s robust ecosystem and ongoing development make it a prominent player in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Ethereum\u2019s merge had not taken place at the time of ChatGPT\u2019s knowledge cutoff on this topic.\n\nAt number three came BNB \u2013 the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange. The AI explained:\n\nBinance\u2019s strong market position and innovative offerings contribute to BNB\u2019s potential longevity.\n\nCardano Also Made the Cut\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, ADA has a unique approach and a growing community, and this makes it a cryptocurrency to watch.\n\nNow, to those of you who have been following the industry for a while, this probably doesn\u2019t come much as a surprise since Cardano has been amongst the frontrunners for quite some time.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, Cardano\u2019s founder, is also one of the founding members of Ethereum.\n\nBut this is where things get a bit interesting and, quite frankly, surprising.\n\nTether or Ripple? ChatGPT Thinks Neither\n\nTether\u2019s USDT and Ripple\u2019s XRP have been some of the veteran cryptocurrencies that almost always made their cut in the top 10. Both of them are backed by major companies with considerable funding and a ton of talent.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT thinks that Polkadot (DOT) is the fifth cryptocurrency from our question that will make the cut and survive in the next decade.\n\nIt argued that:\n\nPolakdot\u2019s interoperability features and growing ecosystem position it as a potential long-term player in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nNow, does the above mean other cryptocurrencies will collapse? Probably not. Of course, none of this should be construed as financial advice. The content is for educational and entertainment purposes only, and you should always make your own research and consult a professional on the matter. However, it is quite interesting to poke the digital brains of an AI language model that seems to have an answer different than what many would think."

        "content": "Rebecca Martin, founder of Safe BnB. (Credit: Courtesy of Safe BnB)\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Safe BnB has been named to The Story Exchange\u2019s 2023 list of 10 Brilliant Business Ideas.\n\nDuring Covid lockdowns, Airbnb \u201csuperhost\u201d Rebecca Martin saw numerous requests asking hosts to donate stays to Mexican migrants and Ukrainian refugees. Edwards was touched by how Airbnb hosts were able to help those in need \u2013 but also began to wonder why such a resource wasn\u2019t available for women needing emergency short-term housing solutions. She knew she had to act \u2013 especially since, according to the National Network to End Domestic Violence\u2019s 2020 Census, the most commonly requested unmet need is shelter. Edwards, of Dallas, is in the process of launching Safe BnB, which will provide such housing for women escaping abusive situations, keeping them secure as they get back on their feet.\n\nHere\u2019s our lightly edited Q&A with Martin.\n\nTell us more about why you started your business.\n\nIn many cases, women escaping abusive situations have nowhere else to go. Often, they are lucky to get a spot on a shelter waiting list. Safe BnB will provide a much-needed service for these women by offering a secure place to stay.\n\nAlso, I am also a survivor of domestic violence. That\u2019s the main driving force behind my decision to start up, and definitely an important \u2013 if not the most important \u2013 component when it comes to my \u201cwhy.\u201d\n\nTell us about your biggest success so far.\n\nBecoming a successful Airbnb \u201csuperhost,\u201d which is a program that rewards the company\u2019s highest-rated and most dependable hosts. Hosting was my first attempt at supporting myself after leaving my abusive relationship. I was proud of myself because it was an astonishing success from the first day. And I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.\n\nWhat is your top challenge and how have you addressed it?\n\nFinding the courage to speak about my personal ties to this business idea publicly. Not knowing where to go for startup guidance. This idea involves reaching out to well-established programs and government agencies, all of which have specific protocols that I am not familiar with \u2013 yet! But I am learning and extremely determined. I\u2019m a fighter, and quite smart.\n\nHave you experienced any significant personal situations that have affected your business decisions?\n\nEverything about this process is significantly personal. I am learning to appropriately summon the inner strength I thought I\u2019d lost, in order to give a voice to what needs to be said and a business around what needs to be done.\n\nWhat is your biggest tip for other startup entrepreneurs?\n\nI have learned that every market has their own unique \u201cbarriers to entry.\u201d My advice is to learn and understand, as best as you can, all the ins and outs and strategic best practices required to your specific industry \u2013 especially when it comes to seeking funding. And, seek the guidance of a mentor or coach.\n\nHow do you find inspiration on your darkest days?\n\nIt\u2019s just feeling \u2013 or \u201cknowing\u201d \u2013 that the universe isn\u2019t out to get me or make me miserable. It never was, and it never will be. I feel confident that the universe offers us an abundance of support. On hard days, it\u2019s about slowing down and doing what I can to allow conflict or confusion to remain unsolved. It\u2019s helpful to simply acknowledge that problems exist, and to be with them for the moment \u2013 which means surrendering to them sometimes.\n\nWhat is your go-to song to get motivated on tough days?\n\n\u201cMr Rager\u201d by Kid Cudi, \u201cGirl Anachronism,\u201d by The Dresden Dolls, or some Bob Dylan.\n\nWho is your most important role model?\n\nBren\u00e9 Brown. I believe her theories surrounding the human condition are incredible. How she brings to light the commonality we all share with regards to vulnerability and shame is beyond insightful. She is an amazing researcher and academic. \u25fc\n\nCheck out our Advice + Tips for entrepreneurs starting-up\n\nWatch our latest videos\n\nSubscribe to our podcast"

        "title": "Has the crypto bubble burst? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The year 2021 was marked by the swelling of a colossal speculative bubble in the crypto markets.\n\nHowever, it was not the first crypto bubble ever, because there had been two others before, one in 2013 and one in 2017.\n\nBy analyzing what happened after the previous bubbles burst, we can get an idea of what might be happening right now.\n\nThe years leading up to the crypto bubble\n\nAll three bubbles inflated in the year following Bitcoin\u2019s halving.\n\nThe first was characterized by a resounding rise in the price of BTC, partly because there actually wasn\u2019t much else in the crypto markets. Just after the burst, in 2014, the Ethereum project was born.\n\nThe second was characterized by a high growth of BTC, but more importantly by a resounding growth in the price of some altcoins, including in particular ETH and XRP.\n\nIt was actually already in 2017 itself that many interesting projects were launched, including Binance, and after the bubble burst, between 2018 and 2019, the interest of some large companies and institutional investors began to grow.\n\nIn particular, 2019 was the year of Facebook\u2019s resounding announcement about its Libra project, later to become Diem and finally aborted, through which the famous social network wanted to establish a stablecoin.\n\nIn truth, it was 2020 that was the key year, because after the collapse of the global financial markets due to the onset of the pandemic, Bitcoin and the crypto market reacted with a quick pre-halving recovery that made it clear to virtually everyone that these were assets not destined to disappear.\n\nSo although the largest number of births of new crypto projects were concentrated during the last two bubbles, even after they burst, the crypto market continued to innovate.\n\nThe analysis of DeFi by Forbes\n\nIn this regard, yesterday Forbes published an in-depth analysis of the DeFi world in the aftermath of the bursting of the last major speculative bubble.\n\nThe article begins by saying that by now the irrational exuberance of the 2020-2022 bullish cycle in the crypto market has subsided, but then focuses on the outlook for DeFi protocols.\n\nIn fact, he points out that in the past 12 months, which is after the implosion of the Terra/Luna ecosystem, the major DeFi protocols have largely continued to run smoothly, despite the failures of crypto exchanges and regulatory actions in the US.\n\nIndeed, it reveals that the very regulatory uncertainty in the US actually seems to bring more interest in DeFi services.\n\nIn particular, the article examines the insurance industry in the DeFi world, stating that so far none of DeFi\u2019s insurance protocols have achieved similar success and scale as the major DeFi protocols.\n\nBut despite this, it argues that as long as the crypto ecosystem continues to grow, DeFi insurance is likely to grow to an attractive size.\n\nHe emphasizes the fact that it may still take some time, partly because at this time it is not yet clear whether DeFi protocols will be able to compete with traditional insurers.\n\nThe new post-bubble projects in the crypto market\n\nPerhaps even more interesting is imagining what might happen if new successful projects emerge.\n\nIn fact, it must be said that during the quiet post-bubble phases of the past, that is, after the end of the following bear-markets, the thing that proved most interesting was precisely the emergence of new projects.\n\nThe crypto industry evolves so fast that often a project ages within a few years.\n\nThere are quite a few projects that really boomed during the period when there was a speculative bubble inflating, later surviving its bursting but never returning to success.\n\nWhen analyzing the major cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, it becomes apparent that only Bitcoin is a first-generation cryptocurrency, and among the second-generation ones, only Ethereum is continuing to achieve success.\n\nThe main first-generation altcoin is Litecoin, but it capitalizes just over one hundredth of Bitcoin, and less than 3% of Ethereum.\n\nThe main second-generation cryptocurrency, besides Ethereum, is XRP, which capitalizes less than one-tenth of ETH.\n\nAmong the world\u2019s major existing cryptocurrencies, there is only one other second-generation cryptocurrency, namely Dogecoin, which capitalizes less than half of XRP.\n\nFor example, the third major cryptocurrency, BNB, is a third-generation crypto, along with Cardano\u2019s ADA. BNB however capitalizes less than a tenth of Bitcoin, and a little over twice as much as XRP.\n\nMoreover, among the top ten are also two fourth-generation ones, namely Solana and Polygon, in addition to Tron which is third-generation.\n\nThus, it seems that over time, as the speculative bubbles burst in the crypto markets, many cryptocurrencies survive, but the older ones tend to lose the propulsive momentum that made them take off during the bubble.\n\nInstead, they are often overtaken by new crypto projects, which then perhaps in the long run end up doing the same.\n\nThe exceptions\n\nTo date, only two cryptocurrencies have shown themselves capable of achieving major new successes even after a speculative bubble burst, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHowever, it should not be forgotten that some of the major altcoins, such as BNB and Dogecoin, made a splash during the last speculative bubble, that of 2021. BNB was born in 2017, and at that time it failed to achieve what BTC and ETH were achieving, while DOGE in 2017 did not make resounding gains.\n\nIn fact, even ADA achieved its great success in 2021, while XRP achieved it in 2017 and has not been able to replicate it since.\n\nTherefore, it seems that after an eventual boom due to a colossal speculative bubble, only Bitcoin and Ethereum so far have shown not only that they can withstand it, but that they still have ample room for growth.\n\nAt this point, it will be very interesting to observe the behavior of BNB and DOGE in the event of a new big speculative bubble, because as of today they seem to be the two biggest candidates to be on the very short list of crypto assets capable of replicating booms due to speculative bubbles several times over."
