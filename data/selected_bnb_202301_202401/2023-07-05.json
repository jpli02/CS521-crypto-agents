These include the US SEC lawsuit, early bull market, BNB Chain, decentralization, and scammer entity Binance Nigeria, as well as the upcoming sixth anniversary of the crypto exchange.\n\nBinance CEO \u201cCZ\u201d AMA and Sixth Anniversary\n\nThe crypto community congratulated Binance and Binance CEO CZ for the crypto exchange\u2019s upcoming sixth anniversary during a Twitter Space AMA session on July 5.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe session has many questions regarding Binance\u2019s developments in Africa including peer-to-peer services, a ban on scammer entity Binance Nigeria, and efforts to make crypto grow in Africa. However, Binance can work with regulators on crypto regulatory frameworks and supervision or help with any other issue.\n\nRegarding a question on the US SEC lawsuit against Binance and ongoing negotiations or settlement discussions, CZ said he can\u2019t get into a lot of detail but is looking for reasonable and mutually agreeable solutions.\n\nAlso Read: Twitter CEO Officially Discloses Reasons For \u201cRate Limits\u201d And Other Policy Changes\n\nHe thanked the community for their support during these times and promised to continue building for the crypto space. Also, he pointed out that Binance not only promotes its BNB Chain and other products but also promote Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as other blockchain and projects.\n\nBinance CEO believes in decentralization and wants to see developments in the DeFi space. He said Binance is often accused wrongly of being too centralized. Teams in Binance work independently on multiple projects and let projects grow on their own.\n\nBinance CEO also answered questions on investing in crypto and new projects, listings, and the upcoming bull market. He recommends doing deep research before investing and supporting them fully. Regarding the bull market, CZ said he is not sure whether historical patterns will repeat this time, as \u201cnobody can predict the market.\u201d However, he is bullish on crypto and Bitcoin as the market is in an early stage and will only grow in the future.\n\nAlso Read: Massive 5292 Bitcoin (BTC) Linked To Terra Founder Do Kwon And LFG On The Move"

While a lack of liquidity made it harder to sell some of these coins, on-chain researchers from De.Fi found that the hacker managed to cash out $10 million so far.\n\nOn Wednesday, analysts at Spot On Chain found that the Poly Network exploiter had sent 8.88 million stolen METIS to four middle wallets and then swapped 5.62 million METIS to the BNB Chain, selling these tokens on decentralized exchange PancakeSwap. This led to significant price arbitrage for METIS due to the limited liquidity available.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 PolyNetwork exploiter is selling $METIS on #Pancakeswap and causes a big arbitrage in the price of $METIS.

        "content": "Metis, an Ethereum layer-2 platform, warns users not to buy METIS on the BNB Blockchain days after the PolyNetwork was hacked and $5.5 million of assets stolen. In a tweet shared on July 5, Metis said they took a snapshot of all addresses holding METIS on the BNB Chain at the time of the PolyNetwork hack and when exploiters began selling stolen METIS.\n\nBecause of this, the layer-2 protocol said all addresses that seek to buy METIS from the BNB Chain wouldn\u2019t be recognized. At the same time, they are asking community members to pull liquidity from PancakeSwap, a popular decentralized exchange on the BNB Chain.\n\nAlready, Metis said all METIS minted via the PolyNetwork bridge had been locked on BNB Chain by the PolyNetwork team and had limited liquidity.\n\nThe PolyNetwork Hack And Impact On Metis\n\n\n\nOn July 2, the PolyNetwork, a cross-chain protocol that enables the transfer of tokens between various blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and others, was hacked, and $5.5 million worth of assets stolen. The hacker exploited a protocol weakness to create billions of dollars worth of METIS, BNB, and BUSD tokens on the Metis platform.\n\nThrough this flaw, the hacker minted tokens out of thin air and transferred them to external addresses. A few hours after the hack was flagged, Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, said they weren\u2019t accepting deposits from the PolyNetwork.\n\nThe hacker attempted to mint extra tokens from other blockchains besides Metis. However, the hacker couldn\u2019t proceed with their actions because of insufficient liquidity. At one point, observers note, the hacker held $42 billion worth of tokens but couldn\u2019t pull out all assets because of thin liquidity in some platforms. 57 assets on ten platforms, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Metis, were affected.\n\nSlow Response?\n\nStill, analysts blame PolyNetwork for losing assets, claiming that their \u201cslow\u201d response cost token holders millions of dollars. Specifically, a team of web3 security experts claims PolyNetwork waited seven hours before pausing the protocol.\n\nAt the same time, they noted that the hack wasn\u2019t \u201ccomplex\u201d since PolyNetwork\u2019s logic wasn\u2019t exploited. Instead, their analysis reveals that the protocol used a \u201csimple 3 of 4 multisig arrangement over two years.\u201d\n\nAs a mitigation measure, the PolyNetwork team has suspended the bridge. It is also offering $10 million for anyone leading to the arrest of the hacker. In a tweet, they urged the community to \u201cremain calm and trust\u201d them as they are \u201ccommitted to safeguarding their assets.\u201d\n\nWhen writing, METIS, the native token of the Metis platform, remains under pressure and edging lower, tracking toward January 2023 lows. At spot rates, METIS is down 60% from April 2023 highs.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Bitcoin dips to trade flat; Solana gains; Polygon, BNB lead losers - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether traded little changed on Wednesday morning in Asia, while the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. Bitcoin fell back under US$31,000, but its dominance in total crypto market cap is gaining, a sign of market recovery. Solana added to its gains this week, while Polygon\u2019s Matic and the BNB tokens led the daily losers list. Bitcoin Cash has taken the number 12 spot in the list of top tokens by market cap after its listing on the new EDX Markets exchange.\n\nCrypto price pause\n\nBitcoin fell 1.0% over the last 24 hours to US$30,801 at 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, shaving its weekly gain down to 0.39%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. On Tuesday, the price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, on the back of optimism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications by a raft of Wall Street heavyweights, including Blackrock.\n\nThe level of Bitcoin dominance sits near 50%, which is the highest since April 2021. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, says this price uptrend in Bitcoin is a typical market recovery pattern in which the most significant asset in the sector attracts buyers first.\n\n\u201cIt will probably take about a year of Bitcoin price recovery before crypto enthusiasts start looking for one with higher risk, pushing altcoins higher and leading to a new wave of capitalisation swell,\u201d said Kuptsikevich, in an email statement. He said he doesn\u2019t see altcoins rallying before November.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent price recovery was sparked by Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, filing an application last month to launch a Bitcoin ETF and refiling it again after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated it lacked details.\n\nSeveral other U.S.-based asset managers, such as Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree, have filed their own Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting mainstream finance recognizes the Bitcoin opportunity and wants to offer clients the access to its price movements without actually owning the token.\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, looked to be on a run to break US$2,000 this week, but fell back 0.81% to US$1,941 today after a gain of 2.64% for the past seven days.\n\nThe other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization traded mixed to flat, with Solana leading gainers with a 2.0% rise to US$19.45. The token has surged 15.35% in the past week.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic and Binance\u2019s BNB token were amongst the losers \u2014 Matic lost 1.99% to US$0.6981, though it\u2019s still up 4.29% for the week. BNB lost 1.68% to US$242.83, cutting its weekly gain to 1.81%.\n\nAltcoins have suffered from the SEC\u2019s crackdown on tokens that they deem financial securities. Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB were among those that the regulator named as unregistered securities in its lawsuits filed against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges in early June.\n\nWhile these altcoins have partially recovered after an initial plunge following the SEC suits, several trading platforms including California-based Robinhood Markets Inc., Israel-based eToro and UK\u2019s Revolut ceased support or limited access to some of these tokens for their U.S.-based customers.\n\nBitcoin Cash climbed to become the twelfth largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap at US$53.8 billion. The Bitcoin spin-off is one of the four cryptocurrencies listed on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed, compliance-focused crypto exchange that launched on June 20 in the U.S.\n\nBitcoin Cash had a market capitalization of US$20.6 billion and was valued at US$106.34 on June 19. It has since surged 160% to US$276.87. It dipped 1.70% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 0.80% to US$1.21 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 22.22% to US$31.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAzuki dents NFT sentiment\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.28% in the 24 hours to 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,783.58, but logged a loss of 3.17% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets rose.\n\nHowever, despite moderate gains in the indexes on Wednesday morning, the NFT market overall remains in a downtrend, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects declining sales prices across collections on all chains, but it\u2019s Ethereum that\u2019s really dragging the market down with it,\u201d said Petscher, pointing to the recent problems with the Azuki NFT collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki\u2019s struggles exasperated the already struggling market \u2026 Azuki\u2019s new Elementals mint was supposed to be a boom for NFTs and instead was a bust, becoming a catalyst that drove NFT collections down to all-time lows.\u201d\n\nAzuki NFT creator Chiru Labs debuted its latest Elementals collection last Tuesday, to much negative response from the community, who deemed it almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nWhile the team behind Azuki posted an public apology to buyers on Twitter, dissatisfied Azuki holders formed the Azuki DAO last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO.\n\nLegalDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization formed in 2020 by a group of legal professionals, said Tuesday that it will help Azuki DAO in the effort to claim the 20,000 ETH.\n\nBy NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the trading volume rankings on Cryptoslam with US$3 million, but the volume was down 18.97% on the day. Mutant Ape Yacht Club, another Yuga Labs\u2019 Ethereum-based collection, saw its volume grow 11.94% to US$2.39 million to place second in the rankings.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 9.24% to US$31.5 million. Volume on Ethereum fell 9.17% to US$22.7 million according to Cryptoslam data. Volume on the Bitcoin network gained 3.73% to US$3.19 million, while volumes on Polygon, Solana and BNB all plunged.\n\nU.S. equity futures drop during holiday\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures dipped as of 10:45 a.m. in Hong Kong ahead of the restart of trading in the U.S. following the July 4 public holiday.\n\nFutures on all three indexes \u2013 Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq \u2013 declined but by less than 1%.\n\nAsian equities opened lower Wednesday morning. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.5%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dipped 1.3%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index edged down 0.3%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi also lost 0.08%.\n\nThe Caixin China General Composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2014 a measure of the performance of both the manufacturing and services sectors in China \u2014 dropped to 52.5 in June from 55.6 the previous month. This marks the sixth consecutive month of expansion for China\u2019s private sector. However, the growth rate was the slowest since January.\n\nEmployment in China also returned to growth, as the service sector created more jobs following a drop in manufacturing payrolls, according to Trading Economics.\n\nIn the U.S., New York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. The Fed will also release its June meeting minutes on Wednesday, where it decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, down from 89.9% on Tuesday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 12.6%.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"
