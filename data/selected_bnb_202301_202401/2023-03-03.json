        "content": "Content Sponsored by Truck Parking Club\n\nFinding a parking spot is often one of the toughest, most time-consuming, and most stressful parts of any trucker\u2019s driving day.\n\nThat\u2019s why one Georgia-based company has made it their mission to help truckers across the country find parking solutions by connecting them with property owners with room available for large trucks.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nMarietta, Georgia-headquartered Truck Parking Club uses an \u201cAir BnB\u201d-style concept to connect truck drivers in need of parking with property owners who are looking to make extra money off of an unused space. The website allows truckers to book daily and monthly truck parking at any of their available locations.\n\nTruck Parking Club founders Evan Shelley and Keith Cristal created the platform to allow truckers to easily search for available truck parking across the U.S. and then to book the spot online within minutes. The properties and property providers are vetted by the company to ensure that the parking space is convenient and reasonable for truckers to use.\n\nMany truck parking spaces are available on the company website for less than $20 per day, and the listings feature images of the space or maps to give drivers a clearer picture of what to expect when they arrive. The listing also shows how many spots are currently available at the facility so that drivers can book available truck parking in real time.\n\nThe Truck Parking Club model also provides a good opportunity for trucking companies, CDL schools, trailer leasing companies, truck parking operators, and others to make money from unused property while also providing a vital resource for the men and women of the trucking community. Owners set their own rates and can easily turn parking listings on and off using the online platform.\n\nThe Truck Parking Club website also allows both drivers and parking \u201chosts\u201d to share reviews in order to provide other users with the best possible experience.\n\nWhat Are Truckers Saying?\n\nTruckers are already responding positively to the easy-to-use Trucking Parking Club experience.\n\nSee a recent review left by a driver below.\n\nWatch and Learn More\n\nCheck out the video below to learn more about the Truck Parking Club concept.\n\nJoin The Club Today\n\nWhether you\u2019re a trucker in need of parking or a property owner interested in monetizing a space, partnering with Truck Parking Club is a smart solution.

        "content": "BNB\n\nNew PancakeSwap feature lowers costs for swaps involving $BNB and $ETH.\n\nGearing Up for the Battle of the DEXes on BNB Chain\n\nPancakeSwap is fortifying its position as the dominant Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on BNB Chain by integrating a feature to lower trading fees and moving forward with the launch of version 3 swap and liquidity.\n\nThe chefs at PancakeSwap are facing serious competition with the anticipated deployment of Uniswap v3, the arrival of Trader Joe, the presence of BiSwap and DODO, and the emergence of native protocols such as Thena, Baby Doge Swap, Wombat Exchange.\n\nFollowing a successful deployment on Ethereum, PancakeSwap\u2019s Market Maker Integration is now live on BNB Chain. The feature provides additional liquidity for swaps involving two major coins, $BNB and $ETH, resulting in reduced slippage and lower costs for traders.\n\n\u201cPancakeSwap will not charge any trading fees for the BNB Smart Chain Market Maker Integration, providing users with the lowest trading fees on the platform,\u201d according to a Medium post.\n\nIn even bigger news, the DEX is teasing the launch of PancakeSwap v3 for the first week of April. In preparation for the upgrade, the dev team said there will be an airdrop, and suggested that users \u201cAdd liquidity on BSC PCS now.\u201d\n\nPancakeSwap is the largest of many projects based on a fork from Uniswap v2. The \u201cbusiness source license\u201d for Uniswap v3 is set to expire in April. Right now, the features of PancakeSwap v3 and Uniswap v4 remain more in the realm of possibilities rather than hard answers.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhat is BNB Chain:\n\nPreviously known as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BNB Chain is a community-driven, decentralized, and censorship-resistant blockchain that is powered by Binance. It consists of BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain, EVM compatible and facilitating a multi-chain ecosystem. Through the concept of MetaFI, BNB Chain aims to build the infrastructure to power the world\u2019s parallel virtual ecosystem.\n\nFind more about BNB Chain here:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Discord | Telegram | GitHub |\n\nWhat is PancakeSwap:\n\nPancakeSwap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on BNB Chain and available multichain on Ethereum and Aptos. It offers users various features such as Liquidity Pools (LPs), swapping, yield farming, Syrup Pools, an Automated Market Maker, Initial Farm Offerings (IFOs), an NFT profile system, and other tools. In addition, the protocol helps users make the most out of their crypto assets by trading, earning through yield farming, and winning via lottery, prediction, and NFT collectibles. With the highest trading volumes in the market, PancakeSwap is the leading DEX on BNB Chain.\n\nWhere to find PancakeSwap:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Medium | GitHub |\n\nWhat is Uniswap:\n\nUniswap was launched in November 2018 and has grown to become the largest decentralized exchange in its category. It was built open-source on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the AMM model to facilitate Ethereum ERC-20 token swaps. Uniswap\n\nMuch of the progress made in Ethereum-based DeFi expansion is attributable to Uniswap as it provided the market-making utility for Web3 apps to function in a decentralized environment. The platform consistently records daily trade volumes of over half a billion dollars and has a total volume locked (TVL) of more than $3 billion. The platform has traded over $1 trillion since it launched via over 129 million transactions.\n\nWhere to find Uniswap:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Discord |"
