        "title": "We reviewed The Queen's Head Askham in the Lake District | Bradford Telegraph and Argus - Telegraph and Argus",
        "content": "The Queen\u2019s Head in Askham is a cosy 17th Century bed and breakfast with its own restaurant.\n\nThe kitchen has been taken over by talented Sous Chef Anthony Amos, who serves up a tasting menu worthy of a Michelin star.\n\nSurrounded by fields and a small village shop, it is the perfect getaway for those searching for a moment of peace and quiet.\n\nA corner of the cosy room at The Queens Head (Image: Newsquest)\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Head feels like a relaxing crackly, warm fire - and I just wish I knew about it sooner.\n\nThe attention to detail does not go unnoticed, whether it\u2019s the generous food portions, candle-lit dinner tables, or traditional design with a modern twist.\n\nI love visiting the Lakes for its natural sense of calm and relaxation and I felt like I could breathe from the moment I arrived.\n\nAfter a scenic drive past the rugged mountains and quick stop off in Penrith, the Queen\u2019s Head was the cherry on top.\n\nThe bathroom was topped up with beautiful scents - including bubble bath - and it wasn\u2019t long before I filled the tiny tea pot up.\n\nThe restaurant at The Queens Head (Image: Newsquest)\n\nAdorned with artwork and little extras like an illuminated mirror, the room was a spacious, clean and truly special experience.\n\nWe sat outside in the evening sun with a tipple from bar before sitting down for our meal.\n\nIt was clear just how popular this place is with food lovers - booking is essential - there was not a single table left for a family of walk-ins.\n\nWe didn\u2019t expect to eat quite so much food, so swiftly. Chefs put the stunning plates together delicately whilst making sure we had plenty to indulge in.\n\nHors d'oeuvres at The Queen's Head (Image: Newsquest)\n\nThe tasting menu offers three options per course as well as Canap\u00e9s, a sweet, and tea or coffee.\n\nThe hors d'oeuvres included light, crispy monkfish fritters with tartar sauce, beer bread and butter, and parmesan-sprinkled goats cheese bruschetta with sweet pepper ketchup.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the St Andrews cheddar cheese souffle with summer truffle and soy glazed home reared saddleback pork fillet with turnip, chard, and cider sauce.\n\nThe souffle was fluffy with a generous serving of cheese sauce and truffle. Meanwhile the pork fillet was so tender it almost melted in the mouth.\n\nWye Valley asparagus, courgette, basil pesto, polenta and parmesan (Image: Newsquest)\n\nThe mains arrived shortly after our plates were cleared - Wye Valley asparagus, courgette, basil pesto, polenta and parmesan on one plate, Gigha halibut, shrimp potato salad, peas, samphire, and mace hollandaise on another.\n\nThe fish dish was so fresh and light while the vegetarian dish was something unique and a little unusual.\n\nBut the star of the show was the divine Lowther Honey tart with nectarine and vanilla ice cream.\n\nIt was out of this world, extremely refreshing to the taste buds, and perfect for summery adventures in the Lakes.\n\nLowther Honey tart with nectarine and vanilla ice cream (Image: Newsquest)\n\nWe also tucked into the Casa Luka organic chocolate, hazelnut and frangelico. It was a cooling ice cream dessert hidden underneath an outer layer of chocolate with crunchy peanut brittle.\n\nBy the time we\u2019d finished the matcha macarons and a cup of tea and coffee, so began the heavenly hazy feeling that constitutes a food coma.\n\nThe menu has been expertly crafted by the new head chef, formerly the sous chef at the Michelin-starred \u2018Allium at Askham Hall\u2019.\n\nAnthony Amos\u2019s culinary career began at just 13 years old before he perfected his talents as a sous chef.\n\nHis impressive CV includes cooking for the Italian senate and, in most recent years, working alongside Allium\u2019s Head Chef Richard Swale.\n\nHailed as bringing an international flavour to his dishes, his creations were made even more special by making use of seasonal, local produce.\n\nBreakfast time at The Queen's Head (Image: Newsquest)\n\nWe spent the night exploring the nearby village but it is possible to walk to Askham Fell which provides views of Ullswater and Lowther Castle.\n\nI highly enjoyed our day trip to nearby Penrith, where we meandered through the historic town centre and spent time visiting independent shops filled with little treasures.\n\nIt was impossible not to buy a treat or two in the beautiful James & John Graham artisan bakery and deli.\n\nFull and sleepy, we headed back to our room to enjoy a hot drink and fall into a peaceful slumber.\n\nIt felt like being in the candle-lit, warm world of Pride & Prejudice or Bridgerton with windows overlooking cottages, tree-lined meadows, and a mountain\u2019s silhouette.\n\nBreakfast was just as delightful to the senses as we were guided to our table past pastries and glass jars filled with yoghurt and fruit. Our meal of choice was the full English breakfast.\n\nIt is hard to describe just how special staff at The Queen\u2019s Head made us feel - perhaps you\u2019ll simply have to experience it for yourself.\n\nI'd never heard of Askham until our trip, but for those searching for a new Lakes destination and sense of inner peace, this charming pit stop is worthy of your next adventure."
