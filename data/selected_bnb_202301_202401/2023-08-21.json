        "content": "For the second time in a matter of days, liquidators have stepped in to restore the health of a notorious DeFi lending position.\n\nA whitelisted liquidator address controlled by core Binance Coin (BNB) team members seized $32.6 million worth of BNB on Monday morning from a notorious Venus Protocol lending position in order to liquidate $29 million worth of stablecoins. The position still has $94 million outstanding.\n\nThe position was created in October 2022 following a Binance Smart Chain bridge hack, one of the largest in crypto history. The attacker, believed to be the North Korean-funded Lazarus Group, stole $560 million worth of BNB.\n\nUnable to sell all of it efficiently, they opted to deposit a major sum into Venus, using the BNB as collateral to take a stablecoin loan of $150 million that was then largely bridged to different chains.\n\nOn lending protocols such as Venus, \u201cliquidators\u201d are often bots that seize collateral to sell and repay a delinquent user\u2019s position if it falls below a certain collateralization rate. Because of the size of Lazarus Group\u2019s BNB position, liquidation could send the price spiraling and put the protocol at risk of bad debt \u2014 and the entire ecosystem at risk of cascading liquidations.\n\nAs a result, BNB core team members proposed becoming the sole whitelisted liquidator of the position in November 2022. The team would take on the BNB and refrain from selling it, and instead pay down the debt to prevent systemic risk.\n\nThe team finally had to step in on Friday, using half of a $60 million stablecoin fund deposited into the liquidator address to pay off $30 million in debt across three transactions.\n\nEarlier today, they spent the remainder of the fund and paid off an additional $30 million.\n\nThe position currently remains unhealthy and is poised for another liquidation at a BNB price of $198. While it initially appeared that the liquidator address was out of stablecoins, an additional $30 million in USDT has been added to the address from Binance.\n\nIn an interview with Blockworks, pseudonymous Venus BD & Community Lead \u201cDanny\u201d said that \u201cBNB Chain will continue to monitor and manage the health of the account as necessary.\u201d\n\nBNB currently sits at $210.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Binance Coin price triggered a breakdown from its multi-year descending triangle setup.\n\nThis move works in favor of Binance and against the BNB bridge hacker and his open position on Veenus Protocol.\n\nBinance co-founder Ye-Hi said that the exchange will be responsible for burning the additional BNB\n\nA breakdown of $221 followed by a flip of the $186 support level will add confirmation to this bearish outlook and trigger a potential 36% crash to $118.\n\nBinance Coin price has produced a weekly candlestick close below the key support level at $221. This development has two major ramifications. The first being that a breakdown of $221 barrier confirms the start of a downtrend for BNB. Additionally, the sudden down move has caused liquidation of BNB bridge hacker's position on the Venus Protocol.\n\nAlso read: Binance files court order seeking protection against SEC, cites unduly burdensome requests\n\nVenus Protocol liquidtes BNB bridge hacker's position\n\nIn October 2022, the Binance Coin chain bridge was compromised that led to the bad actor doing away with 2 million BNB tokens. The hacker then used multiple cross-chain platforms to send money to different DeFi protocols. The borrowed tokens were then used to open several trades on the Venus Protocol. After Bitcoin price crashed suddenly between August 17 and 18, some of the hacker's positions were under threat. There was a partial liqudation of the bad actor's position on August 18, lead to the liquidation of 1.104 million BNB position worth $5.5 million at the time.\n\nAs Binance Coin price fell below $220 on August 21, the hacker's positions were liquidated once again. Currently, the hacker's wallet has nearly $258 million worth of tokens as seen on DeBank platform.\n\nBNB Bridge Hacker\n\nBinance co-founder He-Yi said,\n\nThe BNB collateral of Venus is covered by Binance. When the price of BNB falls, Binance will liquidate it in time. These BNB will not affect the secondary market price, and Binance will be responsible for burning these additional BNB.\"\n\nBinance Coin price action puts investors in a precarious position\n\nBinance Coin price has produced three distinctive lower highs and nearly five equal lows at $221 since February 2021. As BNB prolongs this sideways movement, it gets squeezed between two converging trend lines, signaling a squeeze in volatility.\n\nIf such development continues, Binance Coin price could trigger a steep correction to the downside. But the $221 support level is key, a weekly close below this barrier could initially result in a 14% crash to $186. A breakdown of this critical barrier would indicate an exodus for bulls and bears\u2019 reign.\n\nThis development could trigger Binance Coin price to crash 36% to the next key support levels at $118 and 75. In total, a move to $118 from the current position would amount to a 66% loss for holders but gains for short-sellers.\n\nBNB/USDT 1-week chart\n\nWhile the bearish outlook for Binance Coin price on the weekly chart looks logical, investors need to note that Binance has been under regulatory threat for a long time. If the exchange manages to come out of this ordeal unscathed, that would call for celebration. Additionally, if Bitcoin\u2019s situation has also improved by then, a recovery rally would have a higher chance.\n\nIn such a case, if BNB overcomes the $356 hurdle and flips into a support floor, it would not only also produce a higher high but also signal a breakout from the consolidative structure.\n\nIn such a case, Binance Coin price could attempt to retest the $400 psychological level."

        "content": "Bitcoin slumps on low trading volume. BNB risks testing 2022 lows. Akash Network surges after a hackathon. Conflux tumbles on China concerns.\n\nBTC\n\nThe price of Bitcoin was hit by selling last week with the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency losing 12% of its value.\n\nInvestors liquidated US$1 billion in cryptocurrencies during the bearish selling, bringing the total market capitalization to the edge of the psychologically important US$1 trillion mark.\n\nXRP led the losing coins after a U.S. judge granted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval to file a motion to appeal the recent ruling for Ripple Labs regarding retail sales of XRP. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped but transactions continued to rise. The release of minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting continues to fuel concerns of more monetary tightening ahead, while the week ahead has the annual Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers.\n\nAnalyst Markus Thielen said:\n\nRealized volatility had hit 18%; the last time volatility was this low, in November 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day realized volatility spiked to over 100% as prices crashed by 46%. In Bitcoin, sharp price declines have often followed low volatility periods. We are not predicting such a significant decline but expected, at least, a -13% decline.\n\nThe price of BTC traded below $26k on Monday with lows at $24,825. The market has to hold this level or risk a sell-off to $20,000.\n\nBNB\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) fell 13% on the week and now trades at $208 with the coin dangerously close to its 2022 lows of $183.\n\nThe company filed for court protection against the SEC last week, alleging that the regulator is on a \"fishing expedition\" with extensive discovery demands. Binance said in a court document that it complies with a court directive from June.\n\nHowever, the SEC has made \"excessive\" discovery demands, Binance said. Regulators are essentially asking for \"every single document in Binance\u2019s possession related to customer assets,\" the filing states.\n\n\"BAM has worked in good faith, but the SEC has been steadfast in its belief that the Consent Order gives it carte blanche to investigate every aspect of BAM\u2019s asset custody practices without any discernible limitation whatsoever,\" the filing states.\n\nThe company is also seeking to limit the number of depositions in the case as it seeks to protect its CEO Changpeng Zhao and its CFO from providing testimony.\n\nThe move follows an effort from the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange to have a lawsuit from the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission thrown out. The company said that it is not a U.S. company and therefore the suit is unwarranted.\n\nThe price of Binance Coin could put pressure on the company if it breaches the 2022 lows. It was a sharp drop in the native token of FTX that brought the rival exchange down. Binance has been able to learn from that company\u2019s demise but a drop in the coin could affect the company\u2019s collateral.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance appears to be working with Venus Protocol with An infamous wallet that borrowed over $150 million worth of stablecoins being liquidated for over $30 million.\n\nAn attacker was able to steal $100 million in bnb tokens by exploiting a bridge on the BNB Chain. The coins were then deposited on the Venus lending protocol to borrow $150 million worth of stablecoins. Coin Desk speculated that the two projects were working to prevent a sharp sell-off in BNB.\n\nAKT\n\nA jump in the price of Akash Network (AKT) saw its coin up 20% for the week after a recent breakout.\n\nThe coin's trading volume jumped to approximately $5.4 million, which represents 32% growth.\n\nAkash Network is a relatively new protocol that is seeking to compete with big tech in cloud-related offerings. The protocol has been able to see strong growth in its ecosystem since its inception.\n\nThe project is open source and has published it Cloudmos code base for the public to view. Investors are taking advantage of recent lows in AKT to grab a potential contender in the decentralized cloud computing world.\n\nLike other protocols such as Solana (SOL), Akash is targeting a large ecosystem growth initiative with a recent hackathon. The Akashathon opened up submissions until September, as it hopes to attract developers into its growing network.\n\nAkash Network saw its price jump to $1.53 with a potential near-term target of $2.75.\n\nCFX\n\nConflux Network was the largest loser this week with a drop of -35%.\n\nConflux gained earlier in the year when it announced a partnership with China Telecom on a blockchain sim card (BSIM).\n\nDr. Ming Wu, CTO of Conflux Network said \"The BSIM card significantly improves the user experience and lowers the barriers to entry for Web3 and the Metaverse world for users. It is key to allowing Conflux to take its ecosystem to the next level. Collaborating with such a strong partner like China Telecom and initiating it from Hong Kong will allow us to enter the market in the near future, both in China and globally.\"\n\nThe Chinese blockchain company is now struggling with the downturn in the economy and the recent problems with the property sector. Further stock turmoil could impact investment and the company\u2019s outlook.\n\nThe price of Conflux trades at $0.1246 but is at risk of further lows from here."
