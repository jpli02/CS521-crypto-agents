The average cost of a Kijiji rental unit was $1,561 for the month of Sept, while the average cost per bedroom on Kijiji was $999 for the month.\n\nAirBnb had 13 units available on its site, having by far the highest rental prices.

The average unit is going for $2,150, while the average bedroom price is $1,340.\n\nWhile this data gives a good picture of the rental market in Prince Rupert, it is certainly not all-encompassing. Some rentals are posted on other sites, while extra fees such as utilities might not be represented in the advertisement costs.\n\nAnonymous posts on the \u201cPrince Rupert Rentals\u201d were not included in the dataset, as they were deemed unverifiable by The Northern View."

        "content": "In recent times, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed an intense and pivotal period for Binance Coin (BNB). The digital asset has found itself in the midst of a crucial phase, characterized by significant price fluctuations revolving around the pivotal $220 mark. This juncture has unfolded into a fierce battleground where opposing bullish and bearish forces are locked in a relentless struggle, each vying for supremacy within the market.\n\nThe price trajectory of BNB has undergone a notable retracement, encountering a formidable zone of selling pressure right at the key threshold of $220. This level assumes paramount importance as it marks a critical breakdown point, where bears have intensified their efforts to transform it into an unyielding resistance barrier. This intriguing price action is emblematic of the ongoing and fierce tug-of-war between those seeking to exert downward pressure on the asset\u2019s value and those diligently endeavoring to propel it to greater heights.\n\nOn the bullish front, however, there emerges a glimmer of hope that underscores the resilience of buyers amidst the recent pullback from the pivotal $220 mark. This phenomenon suggests that buyers have not capitulated much ground following the retracement, indicating a steadfast commitment to sustaining their influence and staving off any further descent. The tenacious resolve exhibited by the bullish players under such challenging circumstances is a testament to their determination and unwavering confidence.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has long been characterized by its inherent volatility, and BNB\u2019s current predicament is no exception. The battle around the $220 level is a microcosm of the broader crypto landscape, where price fluctuations can be swift and dramatic, often defying conventional market expectations. As BNB navigates this critical phase, analysts and investors alike are keeping a keen eye on the developments, seeking to discern the underlying dynamics that will ultimately shape the coin\u2019s trajectory.\n\nMarket experts are divided in their interpretations of the ongoing tussle between the bulls and bears. Some anticipate that the bears\u2019 stronghold around the $220 level could potentially lead to a prolonged period of downward pressure. They posit that if the resistance barrier holds, it might embolden bearish sentiment, potentially leading to a cascading effect on the asset\u2019s value. Conversely, optimists in the market view the situation as an opportunity for a decisive bullish breakout. They highlight the resilience demonstrated by the buyers, suggesting that the repeated tests of the $220 level might ultimately pave the way for a breakthrough, catalyzing an upward surge in the coin\u2019s value.\n\nMarket sentiment can be a powerful driving force in the cryptocurrency realm, often swaying price movements based on the prevailing perception of market players. As the battle around the $220 level continues, sentiments are shifting with each price oscillation, further contributing to the overall volatility. Traders and investors are closely monitoring market sentiment indicators, as shifts from bearish to bullish and vice versa can potentially foreshadow significant market movements.\n\nTechnical indicators are also being closely scrutinized to gain insights into BNB\u2019s future trajectory. Chart patterns, moving averages, and trading volumes are all under the microscope as analysts seek to decipher the underlying trends that might dictate the coin\u2019s near-term course. These technical tools provide valuable information to market participants, aiding in decision-making and risk management.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the cryptocurrency market\u2019s inherent unpredictability is part of what both attracts and challenges investors. While the battle at the $220 level unfolds, the larger macroeconomic backdrop also plays a role in shaping BNB\u2019s journey. Factors such as regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, and technological advancements can all have ripple effects on the market, potentially amplifying the ongoing clash between the bulls and bears.\n\nIn conclusion, Binance Coin (BNB) finds itself at a pivotal crossroads, grappling with significant price movements revolving around the critical $220 level. This battleground reflects the intense struggle between bullish and bearish forces, each vying for dominance within the market. The ongoing tug-of-war underscores the cryptocurrency market\u2019s inherent volatility and unpredictability. As both sides strive for control, market sentiment, technical indicators, and broader macroeconomic factors will all contribute to shaping the coin\u2019s trajectory in the days and weeks to come. Investors and analysts remain watchful, aware that the outcome of this battle could hold profound implications for BNB\u2019s future."
