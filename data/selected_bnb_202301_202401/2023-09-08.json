        "content": "PancakeSwap\u2019s 30-day revenue was higher than BNB Chain, thanks to numerous integrations.\n\nThe project\u2019s network growth and active addresses decreased from July highs.\n\nPancakeSwap\u2019s [CAKE] monthly revenue surpassed that of BNB Chain in the last 30 days, according to a post by glebk.eth. From the post shared by the research analyst, BNB Chain\u2019s 30-day revenue was $931.700 on 7 September. PancakeSwap\u2019s revenue was higher, however, with $970,800 during the same period.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s CAKE\u2019s market cap in BNB\u2019s terms\n\nIn the blockchain business model, projects gain revenue in different ways. But most make money from fees paid by users to the protocol. And to put it to use, validators who help run the network get paid.\n\nThere are others, like the token holders, who get a piece of the pie for burning tokens.\n\nMore integration, more fees\n\nInterestingly, PancakeSwap operates on the BNB Chain since the latter offers lower transaction costs to enable users to swap tokens, unlike the fees of Ethereum [ETH].\n\nAccording to Token Terminal, fees generated by PancakeSwap, as of 6 September, was $96,237. This was much higher than the value the day before, meaning there was an increase in user transactions.\n\nHowever, that is not the only factor that has helped PancakeSwap surpass BNB Chain. In August, the projects partnered and integrated with others, which experienced a surge in network activity.\n\nFirst, PancakeSwap integrated with Linea, the Ethereum optimistic rollup and L2 project. A few days later, the popular Automated Market Maker (AMM) announced its collaboration with Coinbase\u2019s L2 network Base.\n\nThe Base integration seemed to be the icing on the cake, especially as the project enjoyed a considerable increase in utility and hype.\n\nSome Pancakes are down the drain\n\nDespite the hike in DEX volume and revenue, PancakeSwap\u2019s network growth has not been impressive.\n\nNetwork growth measures the number of new addresses interacting with a network. When the metric increases, it means the adoption of the project has increased. However, a decrease in the network growth suggests a loss in traction.\n\nTherefore, PancakeSwap\u2019s network growth condition suggested that new addresses have refrained from making transfers or swapping tokens on the network. Active addresses on the network were not better either.\n\nUnlike network growth, active addresses indicate the daily level of crowd interaction. So, an increase in the metric suggested that a lot of distinct addresses participated in transfers on the network.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 CAKEs worth today?\n\nA decrease in active addresses meant that speculation around assets on the network had reduced at press time.\n\nAt the time of writing, PancakeSwap\u2019s 30-day active addresses were down to 63,900. This means that there were fewer users who either sent or received tokens on the chain compared to July."

        "content": "Crypto exchange Binance will no longer allow users to buy or list NFTs linked to the Polygon network from the end of this month.\n\nCrypto exchange Binance is stopping support for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) linked to the Polygon Network, less than a year after launching support for the network.\n\nUsers will no longer be able to buy, deposit or list NFTs linked to the Polygon Network from the end of this month, according to a blog post from the company. Users will have until the end of this year to withdraw their Polygon NFTs from Binance\u2019s NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201cThis decision was made after careful consideration and evaluation, and it is part of our ongoing efforts to streamline product offerings on Binance NFT Marketplace,\u201d said the company in the blog post.\n\nThe company is also streamlining its product offerings by shuttering a staking program linked to NFTs from the Web3 gaming platform The Sandbox, which was hosted on the Polygon Network.\n\nBinance introduced Polygon NFTs onto its marketplace in March of this year as part of a strategy that \u201celevates Binance NFT to a multi-chain, open marketplace ecosystem.\u201d\n\nHowever, the exchange has faced several headwinds this year including charges from the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Binance has said it intends to defend itself \u201cvigorously\u201d against the lawsuits.\n\nTop level executives have also left the company in recent months including chief strategy officer Patrick Hillmann and general counsel Han Ng. Bloomberg reported this week that several more regional heads had left the exchange.\n\nBinance\u2019s CEO Changpeng Zhao pushed back on recent reports in a post on X on Sep. 7.\n\n\u201cBinance probably also have the lowest founding team turnover of any tech startup of our size and age, in the world,\u201d said Zhao in the post.\n\nSaw some debates in the community. When you do the right thing, and there is FUD, you don't have to do anything. The community defends you. Let me summarize. There have been a lot of negative news/rumors, bank runs, lawsuits, closing of fiat channels, product wind downs,\u2026 \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 BNB (@cz_binance) September 7, 2023\n\nThe decision to stop support for Polygon NFTs comes as the exchange winds down several other offerings. The exchange recently made the decision to phase out support for its native stablecoin BUSD, after its partner for the stablecoin, Paxos, halted minting. It also ended its crypto card partnerships with Visa and Mastercard in select countries.\n\nBinance\u2019s NFT marketplace now supports three blockchains: BNB Chain, Ethereum and Bitcoin. Binance, Polygon and The Sandbox did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
