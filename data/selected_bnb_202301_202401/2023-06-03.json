        "content": "Lynda Hong, Chen Xinyi and BNB Diviyadhaarshini\n\nThe Straits Times\n\nJune 1, 2023\n\nAt least one person received a written warning on Thursday, when the National Environment Agency (NEA) tightened enforcement measures against those who do not return their trays at hawker centres, foodcourts and coffee shops.\n\nSpeaking in Mandarin, the elderly diner, who was at Chinatown Complex Food Centre, said he seldom visits the food centre and had gone there after his doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nClaiming to be unfamiliar with the location of the tray return shelves and that the signs to them were not visible to him, the 80-year-old man, who wished to be known only as Mr Huang, alleged that the previous diner had also left behind a tray and crockery at his table.\n\n\u201cHence, I had the impression that there was no need to return the tray,\u201d he told reporters who were accompanying plain-clothes NEA officers on their rounds at the food centre.\n\nEarlier, at Kebun Baru Food Centre, three groups of diners were seen wandering around with their used trays looking for the tray return station.\n\nWhile posters to encourage diners to return their trays were put up, there were no signs to direct them to the tray return shelves, which were located in a corner away from the dining area.\n\nHowever, only one table was seen with uncleared trays.\n\nA diner, who wished to be known only as Ms Tan, told The Straits Times that she began clearing and returning her trays after the regulations were first imposed in May 2021, as she did not want to be fined. Thus, the tightened regulations did not make a difference to her.\n\nThe NEA had announced that from Thursday, NEA and Singapore Food Agency enforcement officers will record the particulars of diners who do not return their used trays, crockery and other litter, instead of first reminding them to do so before issuing a written warning for non-compliance.\n\nFirst-time offenders will be issued a written warning, while second-time offenders face a $300 composition fine. Subsequent offenders may face court fines of up to $2,000 for the first conviction.\n\nAt the Koufu foodcourt at Toa Payoh HDB Hub, the crowd picked up in the late morning.\n\nWhile most tables were occupied, at least four with leftover crockery and litter on them were conspicuously vacant.\n\nA cleaner who spoke to ST said some customers mistakenly assume they do not need to clear their tables because they see her clearing the plates and tray return shelves.\n\n\u201cUsually I do that quite fast, so I think some people who see me doing it think I\u2019ll do it for them, and they just leave without cleaning up,\u201d said the cleaner, who declined to be named.\n\nMr Suhaizat Aizat, 21, a cleaner at Telok Blangah Food Centre, said many diners clear and return their plates only after reminders from the cleaners to do so.\n\n\u201cWe have to tell customers many times each day to return their plates,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough most customers return their plates, sometimes the diners coming in will still complain to us that the tables are not clean.\u201d\n\nA cleaner at a coffee shop at Block 226D Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, who did not want to be named, said diners do ask her to clear left-behind trays at tables.\n\nThe 62-year-old said: \u201cThe people who want to sit at the table come to me to ask me to clean it, but that is not their fault. I don\u2019t expect them to clean other people\u2019s mess.\u201d"

        "title": "The Memecoin Hype: How Social Media Drives Frenzies and Price Surges - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "WEB3\n\nUncovering the rise of memecoins, their reliance on social media platforms like Reddit and TikTok, and the cautionary factors investors need to consider.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nMemecoins, cryptocurrencies based on memes, have gained massive attention and generated price surges.\n\nSocial media platforms like Reddit and TikTok are crucial in promoting memecoins and creating frenzies.\n\nFOMO drives retail investors to rush into memecoins, but they often lack fundamental value and carry high risks.\n\nWhile price surges can occur, memecoins are volatile, and investors should approach them with caution, conducting thorough research and diversifying their portfolios.\n\nMemecoins have taken the world by storm, drawing massive attention and generating unprecedented price surges. What sets them apart from traditional cryptocurrencies is their reliance on social media platforms for promotion and the subsequent frenzies they create.\n\nThis article explores the memecoin hype and how social media plays a pivotal role in driving these frenzies and price surges.\n\nThe Rise of Memecoins\n\nMemecoins, as the name suggests, are cryptocurrencies primarily based on memes or internet culture. They typically gain popularity through viral internet trends and memes, which are shared and spread rapidly across various social media platforms.\n\nOne of the earliest and most well-known memecoins is Dogecoin, which started as a joke in 2013 but has since gained a dedicated following and achieved substantial market capitalization.\n\nThe Power of Social Media\n\nSocial media platforms like Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have been breeding grounds for memecoin hype. These platforms allow users to share ideas, content, and investment tips with a vast audience. When a memecoin catches the attention of influential individuals or gains traction within online communities, it can rapidly snowball into a social media frenzy.\n\nThe influence of social media platforms on memecoins cannot be understated. They create an environment where trends can be born and spread rapidly, leading to a surge in demand and subsequent price appreciation.\n\nThe Frenzy Begins\n\nWhen a memecoin gains traction on social media, it often leads to a frenzy among retail investors. FOMO, or the Fear Of Missing Out, kicks in as individuals witness others making substantial gains quickly. As a result, people rush to buy into the memecoin, hoping to ride the wave of hype and turn a quick profit.\n\nThis behaviour is not without risks. Memecoins often lack fundamental value and are driven solely by speculative demand. Investors can easily get caught up in the excitement, disregarding traditional investment principles and the potential risks. In contrast, some individuals manage to make significant profits.\n\nPrice Surges and Volatility\n\nThe frenzies created by social media can lead to massive price surges for memecoins. These price spikes are often irrational and detached from any underlying fundamentals. The combination of high demand, limited supply, and speculative trading can create a perfect storm that drives prices to unprecedented levels.\n\nHowever, the volatility of memecoins is a double-edged sword. While some investors benefit from the price surges, others suffer significant losses when the bubble eventually bursts. Moreover, the market corrections following such surges can be swift and severe, leaving investors scrambling to exit their positions.\n\nInvesting in Memecoins: Proceed with Caution\n\nFor those considering investing in memecoins, it's crucial to approach the market with caution and a healthy dose of skepticism. While some individuals have made significant profits during the hype, it's essential to understand the risks and speculative nature of these assets.\n\nHere are a few factors to consider before diving into memecoins:\n\n1. Do Your Research: Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including memecoins, thoroughly research the project, its underlying technology, and the team behind it. Understand the tokenomics and assess the potential long-term value.\n\n2. Be Mindful of Hype: Don't let FOMO drive your investment decisions. Just because a memecoin is gaining attention on social media doesn't guarantee its long-term success or value. Separate genuine potential from mere hype.\n\n3. Diversify Your Portfolio: Investing solely in memecoins is highly risky. Instead, diversify your investment portfolio by including established cryptocurrencies with solid fundamentals and other traditional assets.\n\n4. Set Realistic Expectations: Memecoins can experience extreme volatility, so it's essential to set realistic expectations and not invest more than you can afford to lose. Avoid investing your life savings or funds meant for essential expenses.\n\n5. Stay Informed: Keep up with the latest news, market trends, and regulatory developments. Then, stay vigilant and be prepared to adapt your investment strategy accordingly.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe memecoin hype driven by social media has undeniably captured the attention of the cryptocurrency world. These assets, often born out of internet culture and viral trends, have witnessed meteoric price rises, creating excitement and concerns. However, while the social media-driven frenzy can offer opportunities for profits, it also carries significant risks and ethical implications.\n\nInvestors must exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and approach memecoins with a level-headed mindset. The memecoin phenomenon serves as a reminder that, in the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, critical thinking and due diligence are paramount to navigating the market's ever-changing tides.\n\n\u200d"

        "title": "MetaMask Wallet Review: Is MetaMask A Good Wallet? - Milk Road",
        "content": "Expert Review: MetaMask Wallet In Transactions\n\nCrypto wallets are serious business, but MetaMask makes it fun. When you first install the extension, the fox icon follows your cursor movements. The well-known fox icon represents an anonymous identity. Your wallet becomes your sign-in for web3 apps rather than a username and password.\n\nI tested the MetaMask extension as well as the mobile app, looking for undiscovered features and evaluating everyday usability.\n\nMetaMask Wallet Chrome Extension Review\n\nWallet\n\nSending crypto on MetaMask is intuitive. To receive crypto, you\u2019ll need to copy the wallet address to the clipboard or click on the three-dot menu to get a scannable QR code from the account details screen.\n\nWhen sending crypto using the extension, I was offered the option to change the gas fee. Higher fees typically provide faster transfers. Lower-fee transactions can get stuck for a while if the network is busy.\n\nI did encounter one problem with the wallet: A token I sent to the wallet wasn\u2019t detected. I had to add the token manually, which can be done from the home screen (import tokens).\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nMetaMask lets you buy crypto through several providers:\n\nCoinbase Pay (not available on Polygon)\n\nMoonPay\n\nTransak\n\nCoinbase Pay connects your Coinbase account and some (but not all) payment methods you have saved in Coinbase. You can send ETH from your Coinbase exchange wallet or buy ETH with your bank account or cash you have on the exchange. I didn\u2019t find an option to send other tokens, just ETH.\n\nMoonPay, another crypto provider, offers six tokens, including ETH and three stablecoins. The minimum purchase is $30 with a $3.99 minimum fee.\n\nSwaps\n\nMetaMask provides a swap feature, which works like an aggregator and compares exchange rates from liquidity pools, including:\n\nUniswap\n\n1inch\n\nParaSwap\n\nand others\n\nSwap fees are 0.875% and help fund MetaMask\u2019s development.\n\ndApp Connections\n\nMetaMask\u2019s Chrome extension doesn\u2019t include an app browser, but it runs in a browser \u2013 so everything is just a new tab away.\n\nSupport\n\nMetaMask offers support through two channels: a chatbot and a community support forum.\n\nThe chatbot was able to point me in the right direction but didn\u2019t answer the question directly. The linked article I selected from the suggested list didn\u2019t answer the question directly either but was helpful in that it discussed using trusted bridges.\n\nIf the chatbot can\u2019t help, you\u2019ll be able to speak with an agent. In my case, I spoke with Danny, who was very helpful and did answer my question: To bridge tokens from one block to another, you can connect your MetaMask wallet to the portfolio site dApp linked on the main page of the extension.\n\nPortfolio Site\n\nAn easily overlooked link on the main page of MetaMask\u2019s extension points to the portfolio site dApp, from which you can see an overview of your assets on all blockchains you added to MetaMask. (Assets locked in smart contracts won\u2019t show, however.)\n\nFrom the dApp, you can also make swaps or use a bridge to move assets from one blockchain to another. A watchlist lets you track token prices.\n\nI used the bridge, still marked as Beta, to move MATIC from the Ethereum blockchain to Polygon.\n\nThe actual cost of the transaction was $1.33 compared to the quoted fee of $8.53. Thanks, MetaMask!\n\nMetaMask Wallet Mobile App Review\n\nMetaMask ran poorly at startup on my octa-core Android phone. Once up and running, the app worked smoothly.\n\nThe mobile app supports fingerprint authentication or password authentication for login, protecting your crypto from phone thieves and snooping phone fiddlers.\n\nI synced the mobile wallet with the Chrome extension using the 12-word recovery phrase to explore its features.\n\nWallet\n\nSending and receiving worked as expected on mobile. However, I didn\u2019t find a setting to enable adjustable gas fees like on the extension.\n\nSwitching networks just takes a click but can only be done from the network listing on the wallet home screen. This is something to keep in mind if you wander off to explore dApps on a network not supported by the dApp (like I did).\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nMetaMask mobile offered fewer options for buying compared to the extension. Notably, Coinbase Pay was missing in my region.\n\nOther options include:\n\nMoonPay\n\nTransak\n\ndApp Browser\n\nConnecting blockchain apps with crypto wallets can be a challenge on mobile devices, so MetaMask includes a dApp browser. Coinbase wallet offers a similar feature.\n\nApps are sorted by category, including decentralized finance, decentralized exchanges, collectibles, etc.\n\nPopular dApp Browser Apps:\n\nUsing the MetaMask app browser, I stopped by Uniswap to check on my liquidity pool. Uniswap didn\u2019t see my MetaMask Polygon wallet, instead suggesting I connect with my Coinbase wallet.\n\nI\u2019ll stick to the MetaMask browser extension for dApps, but the mobile app is great for sending and receiving on the go.\n\nWhat Is MetaMask Wallet?\n\nMetaMask is a DeFi cryptocurrency wallet initially built by ConsenSys for the Ethereum network. Since its inception in 2016, support for additional networks has been added, including Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche C-Chain, and many others \u2013 all just a click away.\n\nThe growth of decentralized applications (dApps) helps fuel MetaMask\u2019s popularity; ETH-compatible dApps commonly offer MetaMask as the top option to connect a wallet.\n\nWith decentralized apps, MetaMask acts as both a wallet and a signing key to approve smart contracts. When an app needs permission to perform actions, the app passes a request over to your wallet. MetaMask then shows you the details, prompting you to accept or reject the request.\n\nAbove, the decentralized exchange Uniswap is asking MetaMask\u2019s Chrome extension to sign a smart contract I initiated. MetaMask also provides a mobile app for Android and iOS.\n\nHow Does MetaMask Wallet Work?\n\nMetaMask is a hot wallet, meaning it\u2019s connected to the internet, and the private keys are generated on an online device. Most wallets use two keys: a public key and a private key. The latter is what lets you spend or transfer crypto and approve transactions.\n\nNothing leaves your MetaMask wallet unless the transaction is signed with the private key generated when you set up your wallet for the first time.\n\nThe private key is a long string of numbers and letters that\u2019s nearly impossible to memorize, so most wallets use a recovery phrase of 12 to 24 words that lets your wallet re-generate the private key if needed. MetaMask uses 12 words. You\u2019ll also secure your wallet with a (required) password.\n\nMetaMask uses Ethereum as the default network, but the wallet supports multiple Ethereum-compatible networks, such as Polygon and Optimism. While visible in the same wallet app, assets on each blockchain remain separate. You\u2019ll have to switch networks to access the assets on each chain.\n\nMetaMask lets you connect to popular dApps like Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange, or games and metaverse projects like Axie Infinity or Decentraland.\n\nThe alternative to hot wallets like MetaMask is cold wallets, typically hardware wallets \u2013 devices that store your private keys offline and can connect to a computer or phone when needed. MetaMask can pair with hardware wallets like Ledger, adding an extra permission layer if an app wants to access your wallet. This step can help protect against scams and allows you to confirm each transaction on your hardware device.\n\nMetaMask provides a near-perfect solution if you\u2019re exploring the ETH-based world of crypto. But if you need to store Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Cardano, you\u2019ll need a separate wallet.\n\nMetaMask Wallet Notable Features\n\nFeature Explanation Enhanced token detection MetaMask can automatically detect new tokens added to your wallet. You can also add support for new tokens manually. Support for hardware wallets Pair MetaMask with Ledger or Trezor devices. Your hardware wallet provides a second signature for transactions. Multiple blockchain support Easily add support for Polygon or other lower-cost ETH-compatible networks. Adjustable gas fees Adjust transaction costs with a slider to match the transaction\u2019s priority. Swaps Use MetaMask\u2019s smart transactions to reduce costs when swapping tokens within the wallet app.\n\nMetaMask starts out with a simple feature set, but you can add more functionality in the settings. Enhanced token detection, additional blockchains, and a gas fee UI based on EIP-1559 are just a few clicks away.\n\nMulti-Asset Support\n\nMetaMask supports ERC-20 tokens, including the tokens listed below, as well as ERC-721 NFTs.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nTether (USDT)\n\nBinance (BNB)\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nAave (AAVE)\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)\n\nMatic (MATIC)\n\nAnd many more.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s token detection attempts to identify new tokens you add to your wallet. Most of the time, it works. You can add the token manually in the rare case where MetaMask misses one.\n\nSecurity\n\nMetaMask asks you to set up a password as a first step. After that, the wallet generates a private key and provides you with a 12-word recovery phrase so you can restore your wallet if needed. This is standard fare for hot wallets. The 12-word passphrase can also be used with other wallets, such as Coinbase wallet or Brave wallet, so guard it carefully. Anyone who finds your recovery phrase won\u2019t need MetaMask to access your wallet.\n\nI connected my MetaMask wallet to my Ledger hardware wallet, a simple process that creates up to five new accounts in your MetaMask wallet.\n\nFunds in these new accounts can only be accessed with the hardware wallet but other accounts in MetaMask won\u2019t require your hardware device.\n\nHow To Set Up Your MetaMask Wallet\n\nMetaMask offers a Chrome extension and mobile app. Here\u2019s how to set up the Chrome extension.\n\nStep 1: Download And Install MetaMask.\n\nGo to MetaMask to get the official download link for the extension. MetaMask is open-source software, so it\u2019s easy to make a copy of the app modified for nefarious purposes. Get the real thing.\n\nStep 2: Open MetaMask And Agree To The Terms.\n\nThe Chrome extension should open automatically after it\u2019s installed. You can also find the extension in the extension manager at the top right of Chrome or Chromium-based browsers.\n\nAgree to the terms to get started\n\nStep 3: Create A New Wallet.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to MetaMask, choose the option on the right to create a new wallet. You can use the (recovery phrase) option on the left to add your wallet to additional devices later.\n\nAs a first step, MetaMask will ask you to create a password (write it down). The next screen provides a helpful video explaining how MetaMask works and the role of your secret (recovery) phrase.\n\nStep 4: Write Down Your Secret Recovery Phrase.\n\nMetaMask automatically generates a 12-word recovery phrase. You\u2019ll need this phrase to use your wallet on another device or if you need to restore your wallet. Keep your recovery phrase somewhere safe. If someone finds it, they can access the funds in your wallet.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to verify the 12-word phrase in the extension.\n\nStep 5: Add Networks (If Needed) And Add Funds.\n\nMetaMask defaults to the Ethereum network. You can add networks by clicking on the Ethereum Mainnet dropdown menu.\n\nAfter adding the networks you want, you can transfer ETH-compatible tokens from another wallet or from an exchange like Coinbase. Be sure to use the correct network when making transfers and only transfer compatible tokens.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nMetaMask offers powerful functionality in a fun-to-use browser extension with plenty of customization options available in settings. The mobile app may be better suited to simple transactions, like sending some crypto to a friend when you\u2019re splitting the cost of a pizza.\n\nHot wallets bring risks, such as bugs or hacks, that can expose your private key. But Ledger integration can make MetaMask a safer choice.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs MetaMask Wallet Safe? MetaMask is a hot wallet, which can expose your private key due to exploits or coding bugs. However, you can pair MetaMask with a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor to add another layer of security. Is MetaMask Better Than Coinbase Wallet? Each wallet has its advantages and disadvantages. Coinbase\u2019s mobile wallet can hold Bitcoin as well as ETH tokens, whereas MetaMask is easier to use. Many people use both wallets. Does MetaMask Charge Monthly Fees? MetaMask is free to use, but some activities within the wallet come at a cost. Sending crypto or signing smart contracts both cost fees. Additionally, buying or swapping crypto in the wallet comes with fees. Why Is MetaMask So Popular? MetaMask was started in 2016, so the wallet has had a lot of time to gain acceptance and refine features. It\u2019s also easy to use, supports several ETH-compatible networks, and automatically detects new tokens in your wallet. Can I Link My Bank Account To MetaMask? When buying crypto through MetaMask, you can use your bank account in some cases. But there is no way to withdraw crypto or USD from MetaMask to your bank account.\n\nStaff Writer Eric Huffman Eric Huffman is a staff writer for MilkRoad.com.

The minimum purchase is $30 with a $3.99 minimum fee.\n\nSwaps\n\nMetaMask provides a swap feature, which works like an aggregator and compares exchange rates from liquidity pools, including:\n\nUniswap\n\n1inch\n\nParaSwap\n\nand others\n\nSwap fees are 0.875% and help fund MetaMask\u2019s development.\n\ndApp Connections\n\nMetaMask\u2019s Chrome extension doesn\u2019t include an app browser, but it runs in a browser \u2013 so everything is just a new tab away.\n\nSupport\n\nMetaMask offers support through two channels: a chatbot and a community support forum.\n\nThe chatbot was able to point me in the right direction but didn\u2019t answer the question directly. The linked article I selected from the suggested list didn\u2019t answer the question directly either but was helpful in that it discussed using trusted bridges.\n\nIf the chatbot can\u2019t help, you\u2019ll be able to speak with an agent. In my case, I spoke with Danny, who was very helpful and did answer my question: To bridge tokens from one block to another, you can connect your MetaMask wallet to the portfolio site dApp linked on the main page of the extension.\n\nPortfolio Site\n\nAn easily overlooked link on the main page of MetaMask\u2019s extension points to the portfolio site dApp, from which you can see an overview of your assets on all blockchains you added to MetaMask. (Assets locked in smart contracts won\u2019t show, however.)\n\nFrom the dApp, you can also make swaps or use a bridge to move assets from one blockchain to another. A watchlist lets you track token prices.\n\nI used the bridge, still marked as Beta, to move MATIC from the Ethereum blockchain to Polygon.\n\nThe actual cost of the transaction was $1.33 compared to the quoted fee of $8.53. Thanks, MetaMask!\n\nMetaMask Wallet Mobile App Review\n\nMetaMask ran poorly at startup on my octa-core Android phone. Once up and running, the app worked smoothly.\n\nThe mobile app supports fingerprint authentication or password authentication for login, protecting your crypto from phone thieves and snooping phone fiddlers.\n\nI synced the mobile wallet with the Chrome extension using the 12-word recovery phrase to explore its features.\n\nWallet\n\nSending and receiving worked as expected on mobile. However, I didn\u2019t find a setting to enable adjustable gas fees like on the extension.\n\nSwitching networks just takes a click but can only be done from the network listing on the wallet home screen. This is something to keep in mind if you wander off to explore dApps on a network not supported by the dApp (like I did).\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nMetaMask mobile offered fewer options for buying compared to the extension. Notably, Coinbase Pay was missing in my region.\n\nOther options include:\n\nMoonPay\n\nTransak\n\ndApp Browser\n\nConnecting blockchain apps with crypto wallets can be a challenge on mobile devices, so MetaMask includes a dApp browser. Coinbase wallet offers a similar feature.\n\nApps are sorted by category, including decentralized finance, decentralized exchanges, collectibles, etc.\n\nPopular dApp Browser Apps:\n\nUsing the MetaMask app browser, I stopped by Uniswap to check on my liquidity pool. Uniswap didn\u2019t see my MetaMask Polygon wallet, instead suggesting I connect with my Coinbase wallet.\n\nI\u2019ll stick to the MetaMask browser extension for dApps, but the mobile app is great for sending and receiving on the go.\n\nWhat Is MetaMask Wallet?\n\nMetaMask is a DeFi cryptocurrency wallet initially built by ConsenSys for the Ethereum network. Since its inception in 2016, support for additional networks has been added, including Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche C-Chain, and many others \u2013 all just a click away.\n\nThe growth of decentralized applications (dApps) helps fuel MetaMask\u2019s popularity; ETH-compatible dApps commonly offer MetaMask as the top option to connect a wallet.\n\nWith decentralized apps, MetaMask acts as both a wallet and a signing key to approve smart contracts. When an app needs permission to perform actions, the app passes a request over to your wallet. MetaMask then shows you the details, prompting you to accept or reject the request.\n\nAbove, the decentralized exchange Uniswap is asking MetaMask\u2019s Chrome extension to sign a smart contract I initiated. MetaMask also provides a mobile app for Android and iOS.\n\nHow Does MetaMask Wallet Work?\n\nMetaMask is a hot wallet, meaning it\u2019s connected to the internet, and the private keys are generated on an online device. Most wallets use two keys: a public key and a private key. The latter is what lets you spend or transfer crypto and approve transactions.\n\nNothing leaves your MetaMask wallet unless the transaction is signed with the private key generated when you set up your wallet for the first time.\n\nThe private key is a long string of numbers and letters that\u2019s nearly impossible to memorize, so most wallets use a recovery phrase of 12 to 24 words that lets your wallet re-generate the private key if needed. MetaMask uses 12 words. You\u2019ll also secure your wallet with a (required) password.\n\nMetaMask uses Ethereum as the default network, but the wallet supports multiple Ethereum-compatible networks, such as Polygon and Optimism. While visible in the same wallet app, assets on each blockchain remain separate. You\u2019ll have to switch networks to access the assets on each chain.\n\nMetaMask lets you connect to popular dApps like Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange, or games and metaverse projects like Axie Infinity or Decentraland.\n\nThe alternative to hot wallets like MetaMask is cold wallets, typically hardware wallets \u2013 devices that store your private keys offline and can connect to a computer or phone when needed. MetaMask can pair with hardware wallets like Ledger, adding an extra permission layer if an app wants to access your wallet. This step can help protect against scams and allows you to confirm each transaction on your hardware device.\n\nMetaMask provides a near-perfect solution if you\u2019re exploring the ETH-based world of crypto. But if you need to store Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Cardano, you\u2019ll need a separate wallet.\n\nMetaMask Wallet Notable Features\n\nFeature Explanation Enhanced token detection MetaMask can automatically detect new tokens added to your wallet. You can also add support for new tokens manually. Support for hardware wallets Pair MetaMask with Ledger or Trezor devices. Your hardware wallet provides a second signature for transactions. Multiple blockchain support Easily add support for Polygon or other lower-cost ETH-compatible networks. Adjustable gas fees Adjust transaction costs with a slider to match the transaction\u2019s priority. Swaps Use MetaMask\u2019s smart transactions to reduce costs when swapping tokens within the wallet app.\n\nMetaMask starts out with a simple feature set, but you can add more functionality in the settings. Enhanced token detection, additional blockchains, and a gas fee UI based on EIP-1559 are just a few clicks away.\n\nMulti-Asset Support\n\nMetaMask supports ERC-20 tokens, including the tokens listed below, as well as ERC-721 NFTs.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nTether (USDT)\n\nBinance (BNB)\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nAave (AAVE)\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)\n\nMatic (MATIC)\n\nAnd many more.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s token detection attempts to identify new tokens you add to your wallet. Most of the time, it works. You can add the token manually in the rare case where MetaMask misses one.\n\nSecurity\n\nMetaMask asks you to set up a password as a first step. After that, the wallet generates a private key and provides you with a 12-word recovery phrase so you can restore your wallet if needed. This is standard fare for hot wallets. The 12-word passphrase can also be used with other wallets, such as Coinbase wallet or Brave wallet, so guard it carefully. Anyone who finds your recovery phrase won\u2019t need MetaMask to access your wallet.\n\nI connected my MetaMask wallet to my Ledger hardware wallet, a simple process that creates up to five new accounts in your MetaMask wallet.\n\nFunds in these new accounts can only be accessed with the hardware wallet but other accounts in MetaMask won\u2019t require your hardware device.\n\nHow To Set Up Your MetaMask Wallet\n\nMetaMask offers a Chrome extension and mobile app. Here\u2019s how to set up the Chrome extension.\n\nStep 1: Download And Install MetaMask.\n\nGo to MetaMask to get the official download link for the extension. MetaMask is open-source software, so it\u2019s easy to make a copy of the app modified for nefarious purposes. Get the real thing.\n\nStep 2: Open MetaMask And Agree To The Terms.\n\nThe Chrome extension should open automatically after it\u2019s installed. You can also find the extension in the extension manager at the top right of Chrome or Chromium-based browsers.\n\nAgree to the terms to get started\n\nStep 3: Create A New Wallet.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to MetaMask, choose the option on the right to create a new wallet. You can use the (recovery phrase) option on the left to add your wallet to additional devices later.\n\nAs a first step, MetaMask will ask you to create a password (write it down). The next screen provides a helpful video explaining how MetaMask works and the role of your secret (recovery) phrase.\n\nStep 4: Write Down Your Secret Recovery Phrase.\n\nMetaMask automatically generates a 12-word recovery phrase. You\u2019ll need this phrase to use your wallet on another device or if you need to restore your wallet. Keep your recovery phrase somewhere safe. If someone finds it, they can access the funds in your wallet.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to verify the 12-word phrase in the extension.\n\nStep 5: Add Networks (If Needed) And Add Funds.\n\nMetaMask defaults to the Ethereum network. You can add networks by clicking on the Ethereum Mainnet dropdown menu.\n\nAfter adding the networks you want, you can transfer ETH-compatible tokens from another wallet or from an exchange like Coinbase. Be sure to use the correct network when making transfers and only transfer compatible tokens.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nMetaMask offers powerful functionality in a fun-to-use browser extension with plenty of customization options available in settings. The mobile app may be better suited to simple transactions, like sending some crypto to a friend when you\u2019re splitting the cost of a pizza.\n\nHot wallets bring risks, such as bugs or hacks, that can expose your private key. But Ledger integration can make MetaMask a safer choice.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs MetaMask Wallet Safe? MetaMask is a hot wallet, which can expose your private key due to exploits or coding bugs. However, you can pair MetaMask with a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor to add another layer of security. Is MetaMask Better Than Coinbase Wallet? Each wallet has its advantages and disadvantages. Coinbase\u2019s mobile wallet can hold Bitcoin as well as ETH tokens, whereas MetaMask is easier to use. Many people use both wallets. Does MetaMask Charge Monthly Fees? MetaMask is free to use, but some activities within the wallet come at a cost. Sending crypto or signing smart contracts both cost fees. Additionally, buying or swapping crypto in the wallet comes with fees. Why Is MetaMask So Popular? MetaMask was started in 2016, so the wallet has had a lot of time to gain acceptance and refine features. It\u2019s also easy to use, supports several ETH-compatible networks, and automatically detects new tokens in your wallet. Can I Link My Bank Account To MetaMask? When buying crypto through MetaMask, you can use your bank account in some cases. But there is no way to withdraw crypto or USD from MetaMask to your bank account.\n\nStaff Writer Eric Huffman Eric Huffman is a staff writer for MilkRoad.com.
