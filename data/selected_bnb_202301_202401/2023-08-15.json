        "title": "Can I Legally Stay in an NYC Airbnb? Here's How the New Registration System Will Work - THE CITY",
        "content": "The era of unregulated Airbnb-ing in New York is coming to a close. What\u2019s a visitor in the city to do?\n\nCity lawmakers passed legislation in January 2022 to register and rein in short-term rentals like the ones listed on the booking giant Airbnb and other sites like it. The company and some hosts sued to stop the policy, but a judge threw out those cases in early August. That means, come Sept. 5, the landscape of who can rent out a room will change.\n\nMeanwhile, THE CITY has found that at least one New York company peddling \u201cmedium-term\u201d rentals \u2014 designed for people staying in the city between three and six months \u2014 has been leasing apartments that were recently rent-stabilized and questionably deregulated. Several tenants told THE CITY that the advertised amenities did not match the reality they encountered.\n\nSo, where are you supposed to stay? What\u2019s allowed, and will you end up with hassles for staying in a not-kosher spot?\n\nFinding a safe, affordable place to stay in the five boroughs is a very NYC predicament \u2014 and harder if you\u2019re doing it from afar, especially if you want to steer clear of illegal offerings. Here\u2019s a guide on how to navigate the accommodation landscape.\n\nCan I legally book a place in New York through Airbnb?\n\nYes, you can, but there are a few things to watch for as you\u2019re looking at listings.\n\nThe situation on sites like Airbnb is in flux with the Sept. 5 start of enforcement of New York\u2019s new short-term rental registration system under Local Law 18.\n\nFirst, you should know that property owners are barred from renting out a whole apartment to short-term guests staying for fewer than 30 days. They are supposed to rent only to people sharing their space, while the owner is there. And rentals can only house one or two guests, no more than that.\n\n\u201cEntire apartments are illegal unless it says, \u2018the host lives here and you have access and you\u2019re sharing,\u2019\u201d said Reena Rani, partner at Singh & Rani, LLP, a Manhattan law firm that has represented hundreds of clients in short-term rental cases. \u201cIt\u2019s really sharing your apartment which is permitted \u2014 and with only two guests.\u201d\n\nA notable exception is buildings classified as hotels and other short-term residences, including furnished apartments run by companies such as Sonder.\n\nRentals of 30 days or more are aboveboard, and not affected by Local Law 18.\n\nThe new law requires property owners to register with the city Office of Special Enforcement (OSE) before renting out rooms or whole apartments on a platform such as Airbnb or VRBO for under 30 days.\n\nAs of Sept. 5, such listings must include a registration number from OSE. However, it will take some time for the new system to be fully implemented \u2014 and for property owners to apply for and receive those numbers from OSE. As of late July, Crain\u2019s reported, OSE had approved only 141 registration applicants out of tens of thousands of short-term rental units in the city.\n\nCould I be penalized for staying in an illegal short-term rental?\n\nNo, you shouldn\u2019t be punished for that, according to the Office of Special Enforcement. Property owners and the listing sites themselves will be the targets, said Christian Klossner, executive director of OSE.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never issued penalties to a guest,\u201d Klossner told THE CITY. \u201cIn general, we view the guests as deceived consumers.\u201d\n\nHis office has only ever had to remove a guest from an apartment on rare occasions when an inspection determines a property is unsafe, he said.\n\nTenants, too, do not have to worry about fines or punishment for illegal activity related to Local Law 18 that may happen in their buildings, lawyer Rani said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the tenant that\u2019s liable for the violations that are issued, it\u2019s the landlord,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, any tenants who rent out their apartment without the landlord\u2019s permission could be violating their lease and subject to eviction.\n\nIf you want to report an apartment you think is incorrectly or illegally listed, do so through the city\u2019s 311 complaint system here.\n\nThe new law is \u201cmore something that a building owner should be focused on, rather than a traveler,\u201d said Vijay Dandapani, president of the Hotel Association of New York City.\n\nIs there a catch to staying with family or friends?\n\nLocal Law 18 does not bar visitors from staying with family or friends in their New York City homes. The law only regulates short-term rentals \u2014 places being rented out for a fee, for less than 30 days. If you are staying with a friend free of charge, the law does not apply.\n\nIs staying at a traditional hotel a better option?\n\nThat depends on what you want. Hotels, by and large, are located in the densest, busiest parts of the city, like in Manhattan, Downtown Brooklyn and western Queens. They tend to be pricier than the average apartment rental, but come with perks like 24-hour security, daily cleaning and concierge services.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get a bit more space from an apartment-based, short-term rental, said Dandapani from the Hotel Association, as the square footage of those listings is larger on average than hotel rooms. But there are \u201ca variety of issues\u201d with Airbnb-like places, he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting your key from sometimes just a box, with non-human contact. So, if something is amiss, who do you go to? Who do you call?\u201d\n\nBe warned: You may think hotels in New York are easy to come by since the pandemic wrecked the hospitality sector in the city. But that\u2019s not the case in 2023. Many hotels closed, and among those that have reopened, thousands of rooms are in use as housing for migrants.\n\nAccording to THE CITY\u2019s economic recovery tracker, as of June demand for hotel rooms was about 89% of what it was before COVID.\n\nAre hostels a good alternative in New York City?\n\nUnlike in many global cities, New York does not have a big network of hostels. In fact, the city outlawed the creation of newly built hostels in 2010 and there are just a handful left, including the large Hostelling International residence on the Upper West Side.\n\nTwo City Council members sponsored a new bill to legalize hostels again in 2019, but the legislation has not moved forward.\n\nWhen booking, what are the red flags to look out for?\n\nExperts say to watch out for:\n\nSeparate locks on individual rooms within an apartment, individually named or numbered rooms, or separate access codes. Those usually indicate an illegal short-term rental.\n\nwithin an apartment, individually named or numbered rooms, or separate access codes. Those usually indicate an illegal short-term rental. If your host will not meet you , or if they say \u201cThis is my building, I\u2019m just in the other unit.\u201d That\u2019s a clue that it won\u2019t be an owner-occupied place to stay, which is illegal.\n\n, or if they say \u201cThis is my building, I\u2019m just in the other unit.\u201d That\u2019s a clue that it won\u2019t be an owner-occupied place to stay, which is illegal.

This could be evidence they are trying to hide illegal listings from law enforcement or a listing site."

        "content": "It was late when we first arrived at Sakura Ridge, but Chef Lia was cheerful and happy to greet us, despite the hour. She promptly poured us a glass of their non-alcoholic D\u2019Anjou Perry, grown from the very orchard the property sits on. She was eager to show us around and we quickly settled into our cozy, thoughtfully appointed River Room. We went to bed anticipating what Sakura Ridge would be like in daylight.\n\n\n\nSet on 22 acres in the shadow of Oregon's Mt. Hood, is a five-room eco-luxury bed and breakfast, working farm and orchard, all-in-one! The inn is open to guests seasonally from April to October and is the source of fruit for Nashi's award-winning perry and ciders. Guests are encouraged to meander around the farm, gardens and orchards, enjoy the breathtaking scenery of Hood River and soak in the blue sky days. With a maximum of 10 guests at any point, you are almost guaranteed to feel like you have the place to yourselves.\n\nEarly the next morning, sunshine streaked across our faces and prompted us to rise early and enjoy the tub with a view. It's not every day you can bathe while enjoying views of Mt. Hood, let alone appreciate the smell of roses wafting into your room on a warm summer breeze.\n\n\n\nSince we had pre-ordered breakfast, we were excited to try our fresh farm omelet and biscuits and gravy. Surprisingly, it wasn't the fresh flowers on the table or the lively conversation that started my morning off on such a high note, but the wonderful grapefruit and turmeric juice shot that instantly gave me a bolt of energy and reminded me how the simplest things can make your day. Between the freshly picked marinated strawberries from the garden to the gorgeous pottery our food was plated on, no item was too small to not be worthy of meticulous selection.\n\nAnd so our stay consisted of lovely surprises at every turn, from beautifully packaged tea bags and thoughtfully placed water bottles to minimal yet chic bedside sconces. At every turn and interaction at Sakura Ridge, it was a treat for the senses. From locally made and beautifully packaged bath bombs to luxuriously rich and aromatic Aesop products and plush towels and robes, we were reminded that everyday rituals like bathing should be a delight and not just reserved for when you are on vacation.\n\n\n\nWe started each morning of our stay with house-made baked goods, seasonal fruit, freshly squeezed juice and our choice of entree. During the day, you can request a cider and perry tasting or order a picnic to be enjoyed on the property, accompanied with a bottle of Nashi Orchards cider or perry to pair with delicious snacks.\n\nIn one weekend, you can barely scratch the surface of all the fun to be had around Hood River. You can visit a variety of farms like the Gorge White House, where you can sip cider and pick raspberries and cherries, go stand-up paddling on Lost Lake, go on a hike to Wahtum Lake, visit a waterfall or two, pop into a few fantastic stores downtown or dine at an innovative and flavorful restaurant like Henni's.\n\n\n\nSakura Ridge was an experience in heightening the everyday moments - from a glass of perry to a cup of tea, from a sit on the porch to a soak in the tub; we were reminded to take time to surround ourselves with beauty. We are all worthy of rest and rejuvenation and Sakura Ridge is our new favorite spot for both.\n\nSakura Ridge is conveniently located near the Fruit Loop, downtown Hood River, White Salmon and a variety of lakes, waterfalls and hikes.\n\nLearn more about .\n\nLisette Wolter-McKinney is a freelance writer for Seattle Refined.
