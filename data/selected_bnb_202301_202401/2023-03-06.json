        "content": "Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange PancakeSwap announced the \u201cPancakeSwap V3,\u201d which will be accessible on BNB Smart Chain and is all set to launch in the first week of April.\n\n\ud83d\ude80PancakeSwap V3 is launching on the 1st week of April!\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf81Early supporters will receive an exclusive NFT and a share of the $135K airdrop\n\n\n\n\u23f0Don't miss out on this opportunity and join us now by adding liquidity on BSC PancakeSwap\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcd5Full details here: https://t.co/5QjGWOxd3g pic.twitter.com/2dpFKZwcms \u2014 PancakeSwap\ud83e\udd5eEveryone's Favorite DEX (@PancakeSwap) March 4, 2023\n\nAccording to PancakeSwap head chef Mochi, \u201cPancakeSwap V3 will come with a variety of exciting features, including competitive trading fees, trading incentives, improved liquidity provisioning, and yield farming experience.\u201d\n\nThey launched PancakeSwap V3 early Supporter campaign. The campaign contains two parts that include exclusive PancakeSwap V3 NFTs and CAKE token airdrops.\n\nIn Part one, the $105K worth of CAKE airdrop is open to existing users with a minimum of $500 liquidity staked in BUSD/WBNB, USDT/WBNB, BTCB/WBNB, or ETH/WBNB liquidity pools on PancakeSwap\u2019s Masterchef v2.\n\nUsers who staked liquidity on PancakeSwap Masterchef v2\u2019s selected liquidity pools before March 5, 2023, at 13:00 UTC and maintain that liquidity until April 3, 2023, at 12:00 UTC are eligible for CAKE airdrop; otherwise, they will lose their eligibility.\n\nIn order to participate in Part 2 of this campaign, and be eligible for a slice of the $30k worth of CAKE airdrop, users must add an extra $500 to $20,000 in liquidity to the BUSD/WBNB, USDT/WBNB, BTCB/WBNB, or ETH/WBNB liquidity pools on PancakeSwap\u2019s Masterchef v2 platform.\n\nAll this need to be done before March 18th, 2023 at 12:00 UTC and kept until April 3rd, 2023 at 12:00 UTC. It\u2019s crucial to remember that customers must add more liquidity using the same wallet they used in Part 1.\n\nTo be eligible for a portion of the $30k CAKE airdrop, \u201cnew users\u201d must add at least $500 to $20,000 in BUSD/WBNB, USDT/WBNB, BTCB/WBNB, or ETH/WBNB liquidity pools on v2 between March 5 at 13:00 UTC and March 18 at 12:00 UTC, and maintain it until April 3 at 12:00 UTC.\n\nThe PancakeSwap team will take a snapshot on March 5th at 13:00 UTC, and March 18th at 12:00 UTC to calculate the value of the liquidity added for the Part 1 and Part 2 campaigns respectively.\n\n\u201cThe airdrop pool will be shared and distributed among all qualified users in the various tiers\u201d, the team noted.\n\nAs a token of loyalty and support for PancakeSwap, if the user qualifies for Part 1 or Part 2 of this campaign, they will also receive an exclusive PancakeSwap V3 Legend NFT and Early Supporter NFT respectively, in addition to the airdrop. These NFTs are non-transferable and are only intended for the campaign, and cannot be sold or moved to another wallet.\n\nWithin 30 days of the campaign\u2019s conclusion, PancakeSwap will announce the winners and the distribution strategy. It reserves the right to revoke the campaign or change its mechanics or rules at any moment."

        "content": "Important crypto updates regarding the prices and news of the cryptocurrencies Avalanche (AVAX), Binance Coin (BNB) and Cosmos (ATOM).\n\nCrypto analysis of Avalanche (AVAX), Binance Coin (BNB) and Cosmos (ATOM)\n\nBelow are details and an in-depth analysis of the three cryptocurrencies.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX): is crypto\u2019s recovery sustainable? Comparison with BNB and ATOM\n\nSince 21 February, Avalanche (AVAX) has retraced 27% after facing price rejection at $21.68. The support level of $15.75 has prevented the decline twice.\n\nHowever, the rebound and potential strong recovery also faced headwinds that bullish traders should consider.\n\nOn the three-hour chart, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) has remained below the 50 threshold for the past two weeks. Likewise, the OBV (On Balance Volume) has decreased significantly over the same period, showing that buying pressure has also decreased and the AVAX market structure has weakened.\n\nHowever, bullish sellers secured support at $15.75 and anticipated a recovery before the block at the descending (white) line level of $16.84.\n\nTherefore, short sellers could seek profits at the $15.75 support if AVAX\u2019s price fails to break through the descending line hurdle ($16.49). A breach below the support may reach $14.89 or $14.36.\n\nConversely, short-term bullish traders could look for gains at the 23.60% Fib ($17.15) or 38.20% Fib ($18.02) level if AVAX closes above the descending line again.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) surge above $22.60k could accelerate the recovery and push bullish traders to the 50% Fibonacci level ($18.72) as well.\n\nAccording to Token Terminal, AVAX experienced a spike in daily active users on 3 March. Specifically, active users doubled from about 15 to 30 on Friday, showing that more addresses traded the token, increasing trading volume and buying pressure over the weekend.\n\nIt aided recovery after AVAX secured support at $15.75, but rejection on the descending line blocked bullish efforts. In addition, AVAX experienced an increase in revenue due to a spike in daily active users.\n\nAny increase in daily active users during the week ahead could aid recovery and the ability to overcome obstacles. However, a decline in daily active users could push the bears to bring down the price of AVAX.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB): focus on crypto price and DeFi hack\n\n5 March has been neither bullish nor bearish given that prices of some coins are rising while others continue to fall. In particular, Binance Coin (BNB) gained the most yesterday, rising 0.30%.\n\nDespite the slight increase, Binance Coin (BNB) remains more bearish than bullish as the price remains close to support at $281.1. Therefore, selling volume is low, confirming the absence of buyers.\n\nIf bulls want to take the initiative, they need to bring the rate back above the vital $300 zone. BNB is trading around $290.5 at the moment. In any case, as is well known, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, was at the center of a sensational $570 million hack in October last year.\n\nHackers exploited a bug in the smart contract of the BNB chain and transferred about 2 million tokens into their wallets. As a result of the hack, Binance had to immediately suspend withdrawals and deposits.\n\nOne of the largest breaches in the crypto space, the incident raised questions about the security of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nReason why, on 5 March, Binance announced that it will work with law enforcement agencies around the world to combat cryptocurrency-related scams.\n\nThe exchange said it has launched the Joint Anti-Scam Campaign, which will include sending alerts, crime prevention messages, and other useful tips whenever users initiate a withdrawal on Binance.\n\nThe exchange added that it started this campaign first with Hong Kong and the project has shown good results.\n\nCosmos (ATOM): a look at the March price predictions\n\nThe price of Cosmos (ATOM), on the other hand, shows signs of a complete correction that could lead to a sustained upward movement. In fact, the chart for ATOM shows that the price is trading in a long-term range of $8.90 to $15.60.\n\nThe range has been in effect since ATOM broke above $8.90 in early July 2022. Since then, the high and low of the range have been validated a sufficient number of times.\n\nCurrently, the price ATOM is very close to the resistance area of $15.60 after it was rejected by it (red icon). Despite the rejection, the weekly RSI is bullish. This has broken out of a descending resistance line and is above 50. Both are considered bullish signals.\n\nIf a breakout occurs, the ATOM coin price could rise to the next resistance at an average price of $22. However, if it fails to do so, ATOM price could fall to the support area of $8.60.\n\nIn any case, technical analysis from the short-term six-hour chart shows that the ATOM token fell from an ascending support line. Subsequently, it started a relief rally before falling again.\n\nWhen combining this with the wave count, it is possible that the price completed a five-wave upward movement, which was confirmed by the breakout from the support line. In that case, price is currently in wave C of an ABC correction.\n\nThe most likely level for the end of the wave would be between $11.95 and $12. This confluence of supports is created by the 0.5 Fib retracement support level and giving the A:C waves a 1:1 ratio.\n\nThus, the correction could be complete. In this case, the price of Cosmos should rise above $15.45 and move toward $22. However, since corrections usually end above the 0.618 Fib retracement support level, a closing below $11.12 would jeopardize the bullish count.\n\nAlso, a drop below the $8.43 low would permanently invalidate the long bullish term of the Cosmos price prediction and could send the ATOM price toward $5."
