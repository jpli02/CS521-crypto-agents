The owners say a tree feel through the bed and breakfast after it was struck by lightning twice.\n\nCo-owner Diane Dube described, \"it was just the sound of it, it sounded like a huge explosion. And for it to do it twice was even more frightening. Lightning does strike twice in the same spot, so don't believe that old wives tale that it does not.\"\n\nThe owners say they've been canceling appointments for this week and next because of the fire system being fried by the lightning.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "The Bankless Guide to BNB Chain - Bankless",
        "content": "Developed by cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance, BNB Chain \u2014 a.k.a. \u201cBuild N Build Chain\u201d \u2014 is a blockchain for facilitating apps powered by smart contracts. Binance has fostered the network to function as a gateway between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) for its global user base.\n\nAs for its fundamental parts, BNB Chain consists of two interconnected blockchains: the BNB Beacon Chain (BC) and BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The former facilitates staking and governance processes, while the latter is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and supports the smart contracts that underpin Binance\u2019s DeFi scene.\n\nWhile the development around BNB Chain has been fairly centralized to date, that hasn\u2019t stopped the network from taking on a life of its own and becoming one of the most popular blockchains in the world.\n\nThe history of BNB Chain\n\nThe roots of BNB Chain can be traced back to Binance Chain, Binance\u2019s original blockchain that the company launched in 2019.\n\nThat first chain was released to underpin two flagship offerings, namely the BNB token and Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange. It was focused on high-speed trading and wasn\u2019t designed to support smart contracts, a dynamic that led to the launch of BNB Chain in 2020 and the blossoming of Binance\u2019s DeFi scene thereafter.\n\nThe pulse of BNB Chain\n\nAt the time of writing, the total value locked (TVL) in the BNB Chain DeFi ecosystem was worth approximately $2.81 billion USD according to DefiLlama.\n\nThat stat currently makes BNB Chain the third-largest DeFi network by size, although it\u2019s down significantly from its May 2021 all-time high TVL of ~$22B. With regard to its number of protocols, though, it currently boasts the most in all of DeFi (648) after Ethereum (912).\n\nAs for BNB Chain\u2019s NFT ecosystem, the network has facilitated over $264M worth of all-time NFT sales and attracted over 800k buyers to date per CryptoSlam.\n\nThe BNB token\n\nBNB is the native utility token of the BNB Chain network, serving purposes like paying for transaction fees and offering access to participating in the blockchain\u2019s on-chain governance system. BNB is also used for trading pairs on Binance and other platforms within the BNB Chain ecosystem.\n\nAt the time of writing, BNB was trading around the $239.08 USD mark with a $36.8B market capitalization, making it the fourth-largest crypto in the cryptoeconomy at the time. Its circulating supply was just over 153.8k out of a 200k max supply.\n\nWhat you need to use BNB Chain\n\n\ud83d\udc5b A wallet \u2014 since BNB Chain is EVM-compatible, you can use any Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, etc.) to create a BNB address \ud83c\udf10 Network support \u2014 use the Chainlist tool to add the BNB Chain network to your wallet, the network ID is 56 \ud83e\ude99 Starter BNB \u2014 like you need ETH for gas on Ethereum, you need BNB tokens to pay for transactions on BNB Chain; e.g. if you acquire BNB on Ethereum you can then bridge the tokens over to use on the network\n\nHow to bridge to BNB Chain\n\nTo bridge crypto to BNB Chain, the most popular methods are Binance\u2019s native exchange-based bridging services on Binance.com and Binance.US. You can learn more on the basics of these processes by visiting www.bnbchain.org/en/bridge.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t Binance users, there are third-party bridging solutions like the Celer cBridge that can be used for migrating funds.\n\nWhat to do on BNB Chain\n\nPancakeSwap is the biggest app and decentralized exchange on BNB Chain. Users can quickly swap crypto tokens without registering an account on the platform, while earning opportunities include staking CAKE tokens in \u201cSyrup Pools\u201d and staking liquidity provider (LP) tokens through the \u201cFarms\u201d dashboard.\n\nPancakeSwap also offers other interesting features like trading competitions, lotto-style games, NFT collectibles, and beyond.\n\nA de facto blend of Compound and Maker\u2019s designs, Venus is currently the leading borrowing and lending protocol active on BNB Chain. Users can mint the platform's native synthetic stablecoin (VAI) via setting up over-collateralized positions, while the interest rates for lending and borrowing are set by the protocol and can be influenced by the community through the project\u2019s native governance token, XVS.\n\nAdditional BNB Chain apps\n\nEager to discover more about the BNB Chain app ecosystem? If you're prepared to dive in, consider exploring some of the other projects on BNB Chain that have gained popularity:\n\n\ud83e\udd99 Alpaca Finance \u2014 Lending \ud83d\udd04 BiSwap \u2014 DEX \ud83c\udf1f Radiant \u2014 Lending\n\nAdditional BNB Chain resources\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into the world of BNB Chain, there's an array of additional resources at your disposal. Here are a few options to help you immerse yourself:\n\nZooming out\n\nBNB Chain has emerged as a teeming network in the DeFi and NFT spaces, boasting a large number of protocols and facilitating significant trading volume. Despite its relatively centralized development so far, the platform continues to have considerable traction in the cryptoeconomy. The L1\u2019s team also just launched its first layer-two (L2) scaling solution, opBNB, which can enhance BNB\u2019s transaction capabilities considerably. Love it or hate it, Binance\u2019s chain ecosystem is here to stay for now."
