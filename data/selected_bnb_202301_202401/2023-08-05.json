        "title": "InQubeta backed by its team, outperforms Cardano in key metric - CryptoNewsZ",
        "content": "The InQubeta (QUBE) presale continues to generate sales thanks to the excellent token economics designed by its world-class team, including investment specialist Burak Basara, marketing lead Valeriy Nemyrov, and blockchain development consultant Dexola. The presale price structure raises the costs of tokens during each of the event\u2019s ten stages. It allows investors to grow their investment by up to 400%, depending on how early they join the presale.\n\nInQubeta offers one of the most profitable opportunities currently in the cryptocurrency space, and it\u2019s already generated over $1.9 million in token sales during its early stages. The project aims to provide an alternative to traditional investment avenues that don\u2019t force investors to meet ridiculous income requirements or minimum investment amounts that exceed the average yearly salary in the U.S.\n\nCardano (ADA) is one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) main rivals, and its blockchain provides faster transactions and lower fees while allowing developers to create decentralized applications and smart contracts. One of Cardano\u2019s biggest advantages over Ethereum is its proof-of-stake protocol which is significantly more efficient than the proof-of-work protocols the latter\u2019s older blockchain used. However, the Ethereum network has since moved to a proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) is set to outperform Cardano thanks to improved token economics\n\nThe InQubeta project aims to open up investment opportunities in AI while directing capital to startups. Its solution-based approach has been a huge hit with investors, and its link to AI has also boosted its presale as investor interest in the sector grows.\n\nThe detailed design of the InQubeta Ethereum-based network and its token economics are almost as impressive as the AI investment opportunities the platform provides.\n\n$QUBE is the platform\u2019s native token and powers all transactions on the InQubeta blockchain. The token supply is limited at 1.5 billion compared to Cardano\u2019s 45 billion token cap. The model creates scarcity, and InQubeta takes things a step further by adding burn taxes that cut the token supply down further. These protocols virtually ensure the long-term price growth of InQubeta tokens since basic economics tells us a reduced supply of $QUBE increases demand.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s token economics and the pricing structure selected for the presale keeps tokens grossly undervalued during the event. $QUBE tokens are currently selling for less than a penny but have the potential to be worth a few dollars in a couple of years.\n\nMeme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) don\u2019t provide much utility besides serving as a digital currency, and it\u2019s not even a good store of money since its token supply is unlimited. Dogecoin currently has a market capitalization of over $10 billion despite not providing anywhere close to InQubeta\u2019s utility and its prices declining for over a year.\n\nIf InQubeta\u2019s market capitalization ever reaches $1.5 billion (which it likely will in the next few years), $QUBE tokens will be priced around a dollar. That gives InQubeta more growth potential than most tokens in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAn alternative to traditional investment mediums\n\nAI startups fundraise on the QUBE network by selling equity-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the marketplace. Investors buy these tokens with $QUBE, acquiring part ownership and, sometimes, other bonuses like discounts on products created.\n\nCardano\u2019s (ADA) struggle continues\n\n2022 was extremely rough for Cardano holders as prices shrunk by over 300%, and Ethereum moved to a proof-of-stake protocol, taking away its main edge against its rival. Cardano prices have struggled to grow ever since, and many investors are dumping their holdings in favor of altcoins like InQubeta, which promise significant returns.\n\nSummary\n\nThe InQubeta presale has taken over the crypto space by providing the most profitable available opportunity. $QUBE prices increase 4x during the presale and are expected to skyrocket when the project is launched on exchanges. Some cryptocurrency analysts anticipate $QUBE will grow by over 10,000% in 2023 and much more in the coming years.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"
