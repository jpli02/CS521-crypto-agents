Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA police investigation that began after a woman believed she\u2019d found a hidden camera in the Airbnb she was renting has found that the offending item was simply a plug socket.\n\nKennedy Calwell and 14 others were staying near Vancouver, Canada, to celebrate a 30th birthday when their \u201cparanoid\u201d friend said she had a feeling that there were cameras watching them, reported Stuff.\n\nIn a now-deleted TikTok video, Ms Calwell said that they initially thought her friend was \u201cjust being dramatic\u201d but proceeded to check \u201cevery single showerhead, all the picture frames, doorknobs, everywhere in the house for a camera\u201d. After finding what they considered a strange outlet that wouldn\u2019t fit any appliance, they took it apart with a butter knife. She said the wall socket \u201cfaced directly to the shower\u201d, and the group thought they\u2019d discovered a surveillance device.\n\n\"You can see in the top here there\u2019s nothing, looks totally normal. And then the bottom one, look at that little camera,\" she said in the video. The group contacted the police, who according to messages shown by Ms Calwell in the video, appeared to confirm that there were multiple cameras in the property \u2013 but this turned out not to be the case.\n\nThe Sunshine Coast Royal Mountain Police confirmed that they\u2019d received a report from the group of friends and engaged a specialised unit as \u201cit was noted that the outlets did look suspicious.\u201d The items were removed and sent to a laboratory for forensic and functional examination.\n\n\u201cOn 30 June, Sunshine Coast RCMP were advised that after examination of the electrical outlets, it was confirmed that they were in fact electrical outlets and did not contain cameras, lenses or any type of storage/recording devices. The complainants, the homeowner and Airbnb have all been notified of this finding,\u201d the police said in a statement.\n\nAt the time, a spokesperson for Airbnb told The Independent: \u201cWe ban hidden cameras and previously refunded the guest as we investigate this allegation.\u201d\n\nIn a new statement, the accommodation platform said: \u201cAirbnb is thankful to the Sunshine Coast RCMP for their investigation, and our hope is that the guests are reassured by their findings. Following their investigation, we have also reinstated the host.\u201d\n\nBefore the TikTok was taken down, it had been viewed more than 6.5 million times.\n\nThis article was amended on 27 July 2023 following the conclusion of the police investigation to reflect the fact that no camera was found."
