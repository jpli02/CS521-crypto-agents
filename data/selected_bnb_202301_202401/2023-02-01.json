        "content": "Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has seen one of the biggest presale events the crypto market has witnessed in the past two years. The presale event will come to a close in 2023, and Big Eyes Coin will offer its last-ever promo code for its presale. The code is LAUNCHBIGEYES200 and entitles you to 200% bonus tokens with each order!\n\nThis token will look to challenge Avalanche (AVAX) and BNB (BNB) in the crypto market. Both Avalanche and BNB are two crypto giants that have shown dominance over their existence. Big Eyes Coin looks to join them at the top and challenge their dominance when it finishes its presale.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Hits $20 Million!\n\nBig Eyes Coin has hit $20 million in its highly-anticipated presale, showcasing the support surrounding the platform. While Big Eyes Coin is committed to making DeFi accessible to crypto enthusiasts, the platform is also prioritising sustainability in the blockchain industry.\n\nThe main way Big Eyes Coin is prioritising sustainability is through its charity wallet containing 5% of its tokens. The tokens will be held for ocean conservation charities, thwarting many threats to marine life, including plastic pollution and overfishing.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has plans to release a vibrant NFT collection that experts predict will reach the top ten projects. If Big Eyes Coin achieves this goal, holding a Big Eyes NFT would prove extremely beneficial to your portfolio.\n\nAvalanche Surges 16%\n\nAvalanche is one of the fastest blockchains in the crypto market. The platform utilises a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, allowing it to achieve one of the fastest time-to-finality transaction rates in the blockchain industry.\n\nDue to Avalanche\u2019s PoS consensus, the blockchain can limit the amount of energy needed to confirm transactions. In 2021, Avalanche announced that the blockchain had achieved carbon neutrality, showcasing that even crypto giants could limit energy usage.\n\nAs mentioned above, Avalanche has surged in value. The platform has increased its market capitalisation by 16.08% in the past seven days at the time of writing. If Avalanche continues this trend, holding the coin could boost your portfolio.\n\nCan BNB Continue Its Dominance?\n\nBNB is hailed as one of the most expansive crypto platforms in the blockchain space. The platform hosts multiple tools and services from which its users can earn income. Most notably, the NFT marketplace, DEX, and CEX.\n\nWhile BNB can help its users earn income, the platform is also dedicated to helping those in need. BNB hosts a charity that focuses on several important issues in the world. Some of these include climate change, child poverty, and a Ukraine emergency relief fund.\n\nBNB has been one of the most consistent performers in the crypto market thus far. The platform has created a loyal community that supports the platform through both bear markets and bull markets.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAlthough Avalanche and BNB have dominated the crypto market with their expansive platforms and dedicated teams, Big Eyes Coin could surpass them when it launches. The platform has shown its worth to the crypto market through its highly-successful presale event and innovative features.\n\nAdditionally, Big Eyes Coin is offering its last-ever bonus code before it expires on the 3rd of February. Type the \u2018LAUNCHBIGEYES200\u2019 promo code at the checkout to receive 200% bonus tokens with your Big Eyes Coin purchase before it runs out!\n\nFor more information on Big Eyes Coin (BIG), please visit the following links:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL"

        "content": "Calmness is slowly streaming in as cryptocurrencies bottom out and post double-digit percentage gains after a turbulent 2022. Helium (HNT) is one of the coins spearheading the resurgence, rallying by more than 35% as Binance (BNB) also consolidates after bottoming out early in the year.\n\nNevertheless, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is worth paying attention to if a 1400% plus rally in stage 5 of its pre-sale is anything to go by.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nHelium (HNT) IoT Prospects\n\nHNT is the native token powering the Helium (HNT) ecosystem. Helium (HNT) has more than doubled since the start of the year as it continues to recoup some of the losses accrued last year. The rally does not come as a surprise. Helium (HNT) has set out to revolutionize the world of connectivity by facilitating communications and connectivity in the internet of things.\n\nThe project makes it easy for people to earn Helium (HNT) by providing connectivity through hot spots and helium routers. While connecting to cellular Wi-Fi can be expensive and impractical while looking to connect through business WIFI, Helium (HNT) aims to enhance connectivity while leveraging internet of things enabled devices. Helium (HNT) is already providing a long-range form of Wi-Fi dubbed LongFi, able to reach 200 times farther than conventional Wi-Fi connections.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nBinance (BNB) Soaring Trading Volumes\n\nBinance (BNB) is another coin on the move and well poised to rally in 2023 as the overall cryptocurrency sector bottoms out. Binance (BNB) is already up by more than 20% for the year. The rally comes at the backdrop of increased trading volume in the Binance (BNB) cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAs investors look for investment opportunities in highly battered coins, the Binance (BNB) exchange remains the go-to platform for tapping into such opportunities. Likewise, demand for the Binance (BNB) coin will likely soar as the overall cryptocurrency sector rallies.\n\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) Decentralizing Crowdfunding\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) is the project attracting whales\u2019 interest from other coins on moving to make it easy for anyone to invest in the most promising and exciting early-stage businesses. For the longest time, venture capitalists and angel investors have enjoyed preferential treatment when investing in highly prospective and early startups such as Uber and Facebook.\n\nThe preferential treatment and edge is poised to change with Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) unveiling a decentralized investment platform. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is to level the playing field, allowing average investors to invest in early startups and projects through fractional stakes. In addition, the decentralized investment platform will allow startups to raise funds and engage the community by offering rewards and equity-based NFTs.\n\nThe platform is to make it easy for businesses and startups to target a wider investment pool through fractional stakes. In this case, they will no longer rely on venture capitalists or angel investors to draw big investments. Instead, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is to allow startups to raise funds quicker and cheaper while engaging the community.\n\nORBN is the native token that will make everything possible in the ecosystem. In addition to acting as a medium of exchange, it will also enable staking, allowing users to stake their holdings to earn some passive income. Additionally, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) holders will also have the right to vote on key decisions and upcoming projects while also enjoying discounts and trading fees on the network.\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a little-known gem that is already drawing interest from whales, given its prospect and potential in revolutionizing the crowdfunding and venture capitalist space. The 1400% ORBN token rally in pre-sale underscores the coin acceptance in the industry. Likewise, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is well-positioned to replicate the success that Helium (HNT) and Binance (BNB) tokens have enjoyed over the years.\n\nFind Out More About The Orbeon Protocol Presale\n\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\n\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/OrbeonProtocol"
