        "content": "Binance\u2019s BNB ecosystem would face a $200 million liquidation if its price were to fall below $220, according to DeFiLlama data.\n\nOver the past week, BNB has experienced a significant sell-off as crypto traders reduced their exposure to the token amid regulatory woes. On June 5, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed against Binance, alleging the firm had violated federal securities laws.\n\nAmong the allegations, it was claimed the BNB coin and the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin were securities \u2013 a charge Binance has disputed.\n\nBNB has crashed more than 15% to $260 as of press time from $310 on June 4, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\n$200M liquidation\n\nIf BNB\u2019s price continues its descent, $204.2 million would be liquidated on the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, Venus.\n\nDeFi researcher Ignas characterized the current situation as \u201cthe single largest potential liquidation in all DeFi that cannot be closed.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the potential liquidation event was due to an exploit in October 2022 in which the attacker utilized a vulnerability on the BNB cross-chain bridge to mint 2 million BNB tokens.\n\n900,000 stolen BNB tokens were deposited on Venus as collateral, which was used to borrow other assets from the protocol \u2013 effectively laundering a significant proportion of the stolen funds.\n\nBinance halted the BNB Chain and upgraded the network to mitigate the impact of the exploit.\n\nBlockchain analytical firm Messari pointed out that the liquidation could potentially cause cascading negative effects on the BNB price and BNB Chain users. Due to this, VenusDAO has whitelisted BNB Chain as the sole liquidator of the position.\n\nIgnas explained that this move would stabilize the market as \u201cBNB Chain will use their own money to liquidate (close) the position.\u201d\n\nBinance regulatory troubles\n\nOn June 6, the SEC moved to freeze the assets of its U.S. subsidiary, Binance US.\n\nIn addition, Binance US recently announced plans to transition to a crypto-only exchange after its banking partners decided to halt its USD payment channels.\n\nThe platform has stated it would defend itself in court.\n\nMentioned in this article"
