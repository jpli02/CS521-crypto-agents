        "title": "$0.001 SHIB Price Not In Doubt As Shiba Inu\u2019s Strong Potential Is Spotlighted Amid Shibarium Boom - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has faced some turbulence recently, with its journey over the past month or so marked mostly by lacklustre price movements. As Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuates, SHIB\u2019s performance has increasingly become closely watched by investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nIt shall be recalled that in the lead-up to the launch of its mainnet Shibarium, SHIB displayed promising signs as holders continue to envision a $0.001 price. The SHIB price saw a significant uptick, rising to a relevant level in the medium term. However, this rally was short-lived, and the \u201cBuy the Rumor, Sell the News\u201d adage came into play.\n\nJust before the mainnet\u2019s launch, profit-taking took centre stage, causing a sharp decline in the SHIB price. The meme coin lost over 30% of its value, struggling to recover from the subsequent sell-off.\n\nShibarium\u2019s Activity Soars\n\nHowever, on a more positive note, Shiba Inu\u2019s Layer 2 network, Shibarium, has experienced rapid growth since its launch on August 28th. The network recently surpassed the one-million-wallet mark, indicating increased user adoption and engagement.\n\nAt press time on Tuesday, that number stood at 1.25 million, according to data from Shibariumscam. Transaction activity on the network has also increased, with approximately 3.3 million transactions being processed since the Layer 2 protocol launched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, while Shibarium\u2019s activity has been on the upswing, it has had a limited impact on the prices of tokens within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Over the last month, SHIB\u2019s price has seen a 6% decline, with other tokens in the ecosystem, like BONE, experiencing double-digit losses.\n\nLUCIE\u2019s Strong Belief in SHIB\n\nNevertheless, amid these developments, LUCIE, Shiba Inu\u2019s lead marketing strategist, expressed unwavering confidence in SHIB\u2019s potential. In a Monday tweet, LUCIE shared a vision for the market, suggesting that significant fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price could be a catalyst for altcoins like SHIB.\n\n\u201cMy personal vision of the market is that we first need to witness significant $BTC price fluctuations. Once the fear of missing out (FOMO) sets in and new investors and money start flowing back, we will gradually see altcoins gaining momentum. $SHIB is one of the most listed altcoins, and I have no fear or concerns about its potential.\u201d She wrote.\n\nNotably, SHIB\u2019s price has continued to maintain stability above $0.000007. While a brief weekend spike occurred, breaking through the key resistance at $0.0000075 remains challenging. Meanwhile, the MACD hints at a potential buy signal, with the 10 and 20 Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) converging as they trend upward.\n\nAt the time of reporting, SHIB was trading at $0.00000728 after a 3.27% drop over the past 24 hours."

        "title": "Uber driver arrested for Durban B&B owner's death is denied bail - TimesLIVE",
        "content": "An Uber driver who is charged alongside two accomplices for murdering a Durban bed and breakfast owner last year telephoned his victim to get onto the Umbilo property.\n\nThis emerged during a bail application in the Durban magistrate\u2019s court on Tuesday in which Manelisi Jali, 25, applied for bail. Jali and two co-accused, Mdumiseni Gumede and Bernard Langa, are charged with premeditated murder and robbery of a 70-year-old woman, Jackie Needham, on August 10 last year.\n\nJali, who was arrested during a covert intelligence operation together with the members of the eThekwini district trio crime tracing team in Mayville last year, had previously abandoned his bid for bail.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday he made an about-turn, opting to mount a bail plea. Jali's Legal Aid attorney, Ntando Cele, told the court his client did not have any previous or pending cases.\n\n\u201cJali also has a five-year-old child who is solely dependent on him. He would also not evade trial as he has no passport,\u201d said Cele.\n\nHowever, state prosecutor Calvin Govender opposed bail.\n\nNeedham was last seen by her employees on August 10 last year around 6pm. They found her bedroom in a mess, the safe was missing from a wall as were her bag, cellphones and car.\n\nA postmortem revealed she had been strangled and had multiple injuries on her body.\n\nEmployees later found her body, wrapped in a white sheet, in a vacant room.\n\nHer white KIA sedan was found abandoned in the uMkhumbane area of Cato Manor.\n\nGovender relied on an affidavit from investigating officer Sgt Nkosikhona Phetha, who is also attached to the eThekwini district trio crime task team, to support his objection to bail.\n\n\u201cIt must be taken into account that the accused has serious disregard for the law as can be seen from the circumstances surrounding the case. He knew exactly what he was doing but had a blatant disregard for human life or the consequences of his actions,\u201d said Govender.\n\nHe said it appeared from video footage that one of the accused made a call, the gates of the bed and breakfast open remotely and two men entered the premises.\n\nA short while later, a third man entered.\n\nPhetha\u2019s affidavit reveals that Jali\u2019s cellphone was used to make a call to Needham who then opened the gates.\n\nVideo footage taken at the B&B and later near where the car was recovered revealed a silver grey Toyota Etios sedan, which Jali reported missing during a \u201chijacking\u201d near the crime scene.\n\nJali was also captured on CCTV footage drawing money using Needham\u2019s bank cards. The pair of shorts he was using at the time of drawing money was recovered at the accused's home.\n\nGovender said Needham was killed during Women\u2019s month, highlighting the disregard Jali had for the rights of women.\n\n\u201cJali was overcome with greed so that human life and the impact he had on the innocent victim meant nothing. We cannot allow people like the accused to roam the streets,\u201d said Govender.\n\nMagistrate Sicelo Zuma said there were no exceptional reasons to release Jali on bail.\n\nNeedham's brother, Oscar Swanlund, said he was happy Jali had been denied bail.\n\n\u201cI supplied the footage to the police. I know what was going on from the beginning. Once I handed over the footage I left it to the police and they have done a fantastic job while working with the private investigator,\u201d said Swanlund.\n\nSharing Oscar's sentiments was Needham's boyfriend, Collin Reed.\n\n\u201cIt's undeniable that Jali was there when the matter was committed. He was part of the murder. They placed him there. I am happy that the magistrate has not taken heed of his assertion that he is a first offender. He committed a serious offence so he is a threat to society,\u201d said Reed.\n\nHe said Needham's death had left a deep void in his life.\n\n\u201cJackie was loving and giving. You can ask her staff. At times we would drive with her through large parts of Mayville and Folweni where we would give,\u201d said Needham. She was eight years his senior.\n\nHe said her pleasant disposition had drawn her to people, mostly underprivileged and who would fall over themselves to greet her.\n\nThe matter has been adjourned to October 23, allowing co-accused Langa to deal with pending matters in the Newcastle magisterial district.\n\nTimesLIVE"

        "content": "Heceta Head Lighthouse Holds Ghost Tours at Keepers Quarters: Florence, Oregon Coast\n\nPublished 10/03/23 at 3:37 p.m.\n\nBy Oregon Coast Beach Connection staff\n\n(Florence, Oregon) \u2013 You'll never think of one famous Florence-area attraction the same. A puff of smoke that appears and is gone, maybe something moves in the corner of your eye, or a faint noise somewhere in another room that you know is not occupied. (Photo Neil Elfrink)\n\nOr maybe there's broken glass that has mysteriously swept itself up.\n\nIt's a history lesson with a touch of the paranormal. These are some of the tales that surround one Oregon coast lighthouse area, and on October 28 and 29 you can tour the lighthouse keepers quarters and maybe spot the spirit yourself. Those two days are the 2023 Ghost Story Tour of the Keepers House at Heceta Head Lightstation, once the home of the men who took care of the lighthouse and their families.\n\nThe Keepers House at Heceta Lighthouse Bed & Breakfast is the only such former living quarters on the Oregon coast that is a BnB, boasting not just incredible views but insanely exquisite cuisine and some interesting tales.\n\nThe Ghost Story tours happen 11 a.m. through 2:30 p.m., allowing you to experience the history of the place as well as that which is not entirely tangible. You'll get to hear what past guests have said and what staff at the BnB have seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach tour runs about 20 to 30 minutes and there's a limit of 15 people per session. Advance reservations of $10 per person are required: you won't get to just show up and pay a door cover, so to speak.\n\nHeceta Head Lighthouse is the only one on the Oregon coast that still has its keepers quarters, and it's the only lighthouse where there's actual evidence of hauntings and not just marketing talk. Tales of ectoplasmic visitations go back decades here, with the family that runs the BnB saying it's a friendly ghost, and they even consider her part of the family.\n\nShe's known as the Gray Lady or Rue, often showing up as an elderly lady or a vague, smoke-like figure that quickly disappears. Some long-ago tales claim she's the remnant of a secret grave nearby while others have it she is the mother of a baby whose grave sits close to the lighthouse.\n\nOne infamous incident was a group of men working on the building, and one of them encountered the ghost and ran screaming from the house. Afterwards, he would not step foot in the famed Oregon coast construct.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nOregon Coast Beach Connection interviewed a famous photographer way back in 2001 (when editor Andre' Hagestedt was working for another paper). Steve Terrill, who passed away in 2021, told the future Oregon Coast Beach Connection founder that he was staying at the BnB back in the '90s, along with another famed Oregon photographer, Larry Geddis.\n\nHe and Geddis both caught a glimpse of something in the shape of a woman in the attic of the keeper's quarters while on a shoot.\n\n\"We both saw it,\" Terrill said. \"You could just barely make out the outline. And then it just disappeared. Steve got spooked and said, 'No, I don't want to think about it.' And later on, when we found out it was the attic we were looking at, I realized it was right above the room he was staying in.\"\n\nLater on, Geddis was quite disturbed when the pair found out no one had been home when they had the sighting.\n\nThe Heceta Lighthouse Gift Shop is open 10 \u2013 6 daily through September and 11 - 5 daily through October. The park is located off of Hwy 101 just 13 miles north. Parking is available at the Heceta Head Lighthouse State Scenic View Point and parking is $5 per vehicle.

Is Binance Visa card worth it? How does it compare to other crypto cards on the market? In this comprehensive review, we embark on a journey to answer these inquiries and more, equipping you with the knowledge needed to make a well-informed decision.\n\nWhat is a Binance Card?\n\nThe Binance Visa Card is a cryptocurrency debit card that offers a convenient way for users to spend their digital assets in the real world, just like they would with a traditional debit or credit card. It is powered by Binance, one of the largest and most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges globally, and it\u2019s designed to bridge the gap between the world of cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat currencies.\n\nWith the Binance Visa Card, users can convert their digital assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB), into fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR) and use the card for everyday purchases.\n\nBinance Card Quick Summary\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Availability Available in US (Not available in Europe) \ud83d\udcb3 Features A Visa debit card linked to your Binance account, available in physical and virtual cards for online and in-store purchases. \ud83d\udcb2 Cryptos Binance Card supports the conversion and spending of BNB, BUSD, USDT, BTC, SXP, ETH, EUR, ADA, DOT, XRP, AVAX, SHIB, LAZIO, PORTO, and SANTOS. \ud83d\udcb0 Fees Transaction fees can be up to 0.9%. No monthly card fees or minimum balance requirements. \ud83e\udd11 Cashback Cashback rewards between 0% to 8% depending in the average BNB balance you hold in your Binance wallet \ud83d\udd12 Security Requires 3D Secure Verification for online transactions. \ud83d\udcf1 App The Binance Card comes with a mobile app for reviewing transactions and daily transfers. How Binance Debit Card Works? The Binance crypto card is a crypto debit card that works much like a regular bank card in some ways. The Binance debit card is connected to a user\u2019s Binance account. Binance cards can be funded with 14 cryptocurrencies, offering flexibility for users who hold different digital assets. To use the Binance card, you simply add crypto into your \u201cfunding wallet\u201d (which can be found within your Binance account). You can either do this by transferring crypto from your \u201cspot\u201d \u201cmargin\u201d or \u201cearn\u201d wallet, or by directly depositing cryptocurrencies from external wallets. If you use the card to pay for 50 EUR worth of groceries, for example, Binance sells 50 EUR worth of crypto (for example BTC) and uses the 50 EUR worth of fiat to pay for the groceries. The process takes the same amount of time as paying with a regular debit card. Users can also withdraw crypto as cash from any ATM. The card is compatible with popular digital wallets like Google Pay and Samsung Pay, enhancing its flexibility and ease of use. However, the Binance Visa Card is not compatible with Apple Pay.\n\nBinance Card Fees\n\nFirst, let\u2019s dive straight into the fees associated with the Binance card. Here\u2019s a breakdown\n\nTransaction fees (within Europe) 0.9% Foreign transaction fee (outside of Europe) 2% per transaction Card issue fee (first) 0 Reissuance of the physical card 25 EUR Inactive account (12 months) 0 Account closure 0 ATM withdrawal fee (within Europe) 0.9% per withdrawal ATM withdrawal fee (outside of Europe) 2% per withdrawal\n\nPlease note that Binance claims to have ZERO transaction fees (within Europe), however, there is a hidden fee on crypto conversion that contributes to the overall transaction costs. When you use your Binance card for payments, your cryptocurrencies are converted into fiat currency. This conversion incurs a crypto conversion rate (or hidden markup), which can be as high as 0.9%. Transaction fees may be much higher if third-party fees are applied.\n\nBinance Card Limits\n\nLet\u2019s quickly break down the daily spending limits associated with the Binance Crypto Card\n\nVirtual Card (EEA) 870 EUR Physical Card (EEA) 8,700 EUR ATM withdrawal 290 EUR Amount per contactless transaction 50 EUR (across Europe) Total contactless payments limit 150 EUR Please take a look at the Binance card fees section to learn about the cost of transactions.\n\nThe spending limits are much higher if you use the Binance physical card rather than the Binance virtual card which is understandable.\n\nBinance Debit Card Cashback\n\nThe Binance crypto card offers cashback for every purchase made with the card. By holding sums of Binance\u2019s native BNB token, users can increase the amount of cashback they receive from 0.1% all the way to 8%.\n\nCard Level BNB Monthly Average Balance* Cashback on Your Purchases 1 0 0.1% 2 1 2% 3 10 3% 4 40 4% 5 100 5% 6 250 6% 7 600 8%\n\nThe sum of the average BNB held per month required to receive 8% cashback is worth around 125,000 EUR at the time of writing.\n\nSupported Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe lack of supported cryptos is a significant drawback for Binance.\n\nBinance Card supports 14 cryptos, namely: Binance (BNB), Binance USD (BUSD), Tether (USDT), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Swipe (SXP), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Ripple (XRP), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Lazio (LAZIO), Porto (PORTO), and Santos (SANTOS). Additionally, the Binance debit card accommodates fiat currency (EUR).\n\nThis is a very limited selection, which may be a turnoff for users with big portfolios or altcoin holders and miners looking to cash out gains.\n\nIn contrast, the CryptoWallet.com Card sets itself apart by supporting an extensive list of over 800 cryptocurrencies, surpassing the offerings of any other crypto card available in the market.\n\nBinance Card Supported Countries\n\nBinance has announced its intention to terminate debit card services within the European Economic Area (EEA) on December 20, 2023. This official decision was disclosed in a statement by Binance on 20th October. However, it will have no impact on Binance accounts.\n\nBinance crypto card is not accessible to residents of the United Kingdom (UK).\n\nThe card is still available in the US along with other supported countries.\n\nHow to Order Binance Card?\n\nGetting your hands on a Binance debit card is a straightforward process, but it does require a few steps to ensure a smooth experience. Whether you\u2019re new to Binance or an existing user, here\u2019s how you can order your very own Binance Visa Card:\n\nIf you\u2019re not already a Binance user, you\u2019ll need to create an account first.\n\nBegin by applying for the Binance Visa Card on the official website.\n\nYou\u2019ll be redirected to the Binance Debit Card\u2019s order page, where you can select how your name will appear on the card. Once you\u2019ve made your choice, click \u201cNext\u201d to proceed.\n\nThe next step involves creating a PIN for your Binance Crypto Card. Keep in mind two important security guidelines: Avoid using four consecutive numbers like 1234 or 6789, and refrain from using sequences such as 7777. If you choose to skip this step, your PIN will be auto-generated, but you can later modify it using an ATM.\n\nAfter generating your PIN, you\u2019ll need to confirm the delivery address for the card. Binance typically pre-fills the address with the one you provided during registration on the exchange\u2019s website. Make sure to review the details carefully and add any missing information if necessary.\n\nConfirm all your details and agree to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Cardholder Agreement, and KYC consent.\n\nTo finalize the process, click \u201cOrder.\u201d\n\nDepending on your country of residence, the Binance Visa Card typically takes about 1-3 weeks to be delivered. However, if you\u2019re eager to start using your Binance Card, you can link it to Google Pay and Samsung Pay for added convenience.\n\nBinance Card Alternatives\n\nWith the card unavailable for new orders and major card issuers cutting ties, it might be time to look into new alternatives for the Binance debit card. No Binance card review would be complete without an alternative product, and we\u2019re going to suggest our own: The CryptoWallet.com crypto card.\n\nThe CW Crypto Card is due to launch in Q4 2023, and where Binance supports 15 cryptos, our card supports 800 digital assets. This is by far the widest selection of cryptos on the market, and we\u2019re offering the lowest fees on the market to go along with it.\n\nThe CW Crypto Card has cashback of up to 3%,\n\nLike the Binance card, the CW card supports direct spending of crypto with no conversion necessary on the user end. Users can also freeze native SPEND tokens for rewards and to unlock higher tiers of card service.\n\nOur whitelist is open for business \u2013 if you want the crypto card with the most cryptos and lowest fees on the market, sign up now and get ready to order your card!\n\nBinance Card FAQs"

However, the Binance Visa Card is not compatible with Apple Pay.\n\nBinance Card Fees\n\nFirst, let\u2019s dive straight into the fees associated with the Binance card. Here\u2019s a breakdown\n\nTransaction fees (within Europe) 0.9% Foreign transaction fee (outside of Europe) 2% per transaction Card issue fee (first) 0 Reissuance of the physical card 25 EUR Inactive account (12 months) 0 Account closure 0 ATM withdrawal fee (within Europe) 0.9% per withdrawal ATM withdrawal fee (outside of Europe) 2% per withdrawal\n\nPlease note that Binance claims to have ZERO transaction fees (within Europe), however, there is a hidden fee on crypto conversion that contributes to the overall transaction costs. When you use your Binance card for payments, your cryptocurrencies are converted into fiat currency. This conversion incurs a crypto conversion rate (or hidden markup), which can be as high as 0.9%. Transaction fees may be much higher if third-party fees are applied.\n\nBinance Card Limits\n\nLet\u2019s quickly break down the daily spending limits associated with the Binance Crypto Card\n\nVirtual Card (EEA) 870 EUR Physical Card (EEA) 8,700 EUR ATM withdrawal 290 EUR Amount per contactless transaction 50 EUR (across Europe) Total contactless payments limit 150 EUR Please take a look at the Binance card fees section to learn about the cost of transactions.\n\nThe spending limits are much higher if you use the Binance physical card rather than the Binance virtual card which is understandable.\n\nBinance Debit Card Cashback\n\nThe Binance crypto card offers cashback for every purchase made with the card. By holding sums of Binance\u2019s native BNB token, users can increase the amount of cashback they receive from 0.1% all the way to 8%.\n\nCard Level BNB Monthly Average Balance* Cashback on Your Purchases 1 0 0.1% 2 1 2% 3 10 3% 4 40 4% 5 100 5% 6 250 6% 7 600 8%\n\nThe sum of the average BNB held per month required to receive 8% cashback is worth around 125,000 EUR at the time of writing.\n\nSupported Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe lack of supported cryptos is a significant drawback for Binance.\n\nBinance Card supports 14 cryptos, namely: Binance (BNB), Binance USD (BUSD), Tether (USDT), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Swipe (SXP), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Ripple (XRP), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Lazio (LAZIO), Porto (PORTO), and Santos (SANTOS). Additionally, the Binance debit card accommodates fiat currency (EUR).\n\nThis is a very limited selection, which may be a turnoff for users with big portfolios or altcoin holders and miners looking to cash out gains.\n\nIn contrast, the CryptoWallet.com Card sets itself apart by supporting an extensive list of over 800 cryptocurrencies, surpassing the offerings of any other crypto card available in the market.\n\nBinance Card Supported Countries\n\nBinance has announced its intention to terminate debit card services within the European Economic Area (EEA) on December 20, 2023. This official decision was disclosed in a statement by Binance on 20th October. However, it will have no impact on Binance accounts.\n\nBinance crypto card is not accessible to residents of the United Kingdom (UK).\n\nThe card is still available in the US along with other supported countries.\n\nHow to Order Binance Card?\n\nGetting your hands on a Binance debit card is a straightforward process, but it does require a few steps to ensure a smooth experience. Whether you\u2019re new to Binance or an existing user, here\u2019s how you can order your very own Binance Visa Card:\n\nIf you\u2019re not already a Binance user, you\u2019ll need to create an account first.\n\nBegin by applying for the Binance Visa Card on the official website.\n\nYou\u2019ll be redirected to the Binance Debit Card\u2019s order page, where you can select how your name will appear on the card. Once you\u2019ve made your choice, click \u201cNext\u201d to proceed.\n\nThe next step involves creating a PIN for your Binance Crypto Card. Keep in mind two important security guidelines: Avoid using four consecutive numbers like 1234 or 6789, and refrain from using sequences such as 7777. If you choose to skip this step, your PIN will be auto-generated, but you can later modify it using an ATM.\n\nAfter generating your PIN, you\u2019ll need to confirm the delivery address for the card. Binance typically pre-fills the address with the one you provided during registration on the exchange\u2019s website. Make sure to review the details carefully and add any missing information if necessary.\n\nConfirm all your details and agree to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Cardholder Agreement, and KYC consent.\n\nTo finalize the process, click \u201cOrder.\u201d\n\nDepending on your country of residence, the Binance Visa Card typically takes about 1-3 weeks to be delivered. However, if you\u2019re eager to start using your Binance Card, you can link it to Google Pay and Samsung Pay for added convenience.\n\nBinance Card Alternatives\n\nWith the card unavailable for new orders and major card issuers cutting ties, it might be time to look into new alternatives for the Binance debit card.
