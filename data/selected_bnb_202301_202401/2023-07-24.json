        "content": "\"The Governing Council of the Bulgarian National Bank has united around the idea of reproducing the design of the current exchange coins, which will ensure continuity in the monetary signs used and will facilitate the recognition of the new currency by Bulgarian citizens, namely: the Madara Rider - on the small coins; St. John of Rila - on the 1 euro coin; and Paisius of Hilendar - on the 2 euro coin,\" reported BNB Governor Dimitar Radev in an interview with BTA.\n\nOn the national side of the Bulgarian euro coins, the word \"Bulgaria\" will be written in Cyrillic (\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f), as well as the word \"euro\" (\u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e) - (for the 1 and 2 euro coins) and \"stotinka\", respectively \"\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430\" (for the 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 euro cent coins).\n\nOn the face of the largest 2-euro coin, it is planned to write a text in Cyrillic \"GOD, PROTECT BULGARIA\" (\u0411\u041e\u0416\u0415, \u041f\u0410\u0417\u0418 \u0411\u042a\u041b\u0413\u0410\u0420\u0418\u042f), which is in accordance with the Bulgarian historical traditions in coinage, added Radev.\n\nThe development of the artistic projects that will be submitted to the Coordination Council for the preparation of Bulgaria for membership in the Eurozone is pending. After their final approval, the projects will be presented to the Council of the European Union, the European Commission and the member states of the Eurozone.\n\nRadev is convinced that January 1, 2025 remains a realistic date for Bulgaria's admission to the Eurozone, \"if we do the right things and fulfill the necessary conditions with a focus on inflation.\" The BNB banking sector will be ready for the introduction of the euro far before the deadline - he assures.\n\nThe governor points to inflation and economic growth as macroeconomic risks facing the country, which are influenced not only by external factors, but also internal ones, more specifically - the development of monetary and fiscal conditions in the country.\n\n\"The BNB is conducting a systematic and consistent policy of tightening monetary conditions. The latest step in this regard, effective from July 1 of this year, is the 12% increase in the mandatory minimum reserves that banks must keep in the BNB. In practice, this means withdrawing several billion leva from commercial banks. The goal is to reduce banks' credit expansion, primarily in the segment of housing loans. This will push down demand and consumption, and therefore inflation.\" said Radev.\n\nThe rates of credit expansion are decreasing - his observations indicate.\n\n\"We are influencing the process through three groups of measures. First, using the available monetary policy instruments - for example, the already indicated decision to increase the minimum reserve requirements. Second, using the supervisory and macroprudential policy instruments - for example, the increase in the countercyclical capital buffer. And third, accelerating the transmission of the ECB's monetary policy, which pursues the same goal. We are closely monitoring the process and are ready to activate additional measures if this is necessary.\"\n\nAccording to him, an increase in interest rates on both loans and deposits can be more clearly defined towards the end of this year and next year.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\n\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 - Novinite.bg"

Photo Courtesy: https://bnb.bt/rupay-card/\n\nThe BNBL RuPay debit cards are accepted at more than 265,994 ATMs and 7.9 million PoS terminals deployed by the member banks of NPCI for cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, and purchases in India.\n\nRuPay is first-of-its-kind global card payment network from India, that is innovative, secure and packed with features.\n\nRuPay Phase \u2013 II was launched in November 2020.\n\n\n\nThis cross-border payment initiative between India and Bhutan was aimed at promoting the use of low-cost digital payment solutions and advancing digital financial inclusion. It allows Bhutanese citizens to withdraw cash and make payments through all ATM and PoS terminals in India.\n\nCurrently, Bhutan National Bank is the only bank in Bhutan that issues RuPay cards.\n\nNIPL\u2019s strategic association with BNBL ensured a robust acceptance infrastructure of RuPay in Bhutan.\n\nThe card is gaining popularity in the Bhutan market owing to RuPay\u2019s customized solutions for its users. NIPL is also venturing into new international markets to widen the reach of RuPay.\n\n\n\nRina Penkar, Deputy Chief \u2013 Product Development, NIPL said, \u201cWe are glad to witness RuPay achieving the milestone of 10K issuance in Bhutan. We would also like to extend our gratitude to Bhutan National Bank for encouraging the widespread adoption of RuPay in Bhutan \u2013 the first country to issue as well as accept RuPay cards.\"\n\n\"We look forward to making RuPay the most preferred card for the residents of Bhutan and achieving many more milestones in the future.

A major chunk of the cards were issued after restrictions were lifted towards the middle of 2022, and we look forward to an exponential increase in the number of customers using this card, by introducing more features, like acceptance of the card for online transactions, for payment of FastTag road toll transactions, etc, in the future,\u201d Acharya said.\n\nKesang Jigme, Officiating Director of Payment and Settlement Systems, stated, \"The introduction of RuPay in Bhutan has played a pivotal role in bridging the gap in cross-border payments, representing a significant stride towards promoting a robust digital payment system with India.\"\n\n\"We extend our heartfelt appreciation to Bhutan National Bank for their invaluable support in reaching the 10k RuPay Card issuance milestone. Furthermore, we are actively collaborating with our member banks and NPCI International Payment Limited to enable the issuance of RuPay cards by member banks across the country,\" he said.\n\nHe said the interconnection between Bhutan's Financial Switch network and the RuPay network has not only introduced secure and convenient banking services but has also fostered cost-effective and cashless transactions by streamlining payment flows into mainstream banking systems.\n\n\"This synergy has significantly enhanced cross-border digital payments between our two nations, reinforcing economic cooperation and facilitating seamless financial transactions,\" he added."

Liquidity pools: If you need to make a portfolio change in a hurry, you can swap your liquid staking tokens through decentralized exchange liquidity pools linked directly from the app.\n\nOur Expert Review Of Stader Labs\n\nI\u2019m a sucker for a clean UI, so Stader was love at first sight. The intuitive design makes the protocol a great fit for people new to staking, but who know some of the basics (like how to fund a crypto wallet).\n\nLet\u2019s face it. Staking can get complicated on some platforms. Stader makes it much easier to get started and provides liquid staking tokens for top cryptos like ETH and MATIC. In short, you\u2019re not locked into a long commitment but you can still earn a healthy yield. And it\u2019s easy.\n\nIs Stader perfect? No. Fees come to mind, but Stader\u2019s protocol fees are competitive with the rest of the sector at this time.\n\nIn this Stader Labs review, I\u2019ll walk you through the basics, discuss protocol security, and share my overall experience with the platform.\n\nStader Supported Assets\n\nStader supports liquid staking for seven types of crypto, with the most recent addition being ETH. When staking through Stader, you\u2019ll get a new token that represents your staked token. You can then use these liquid tokens in other DeFi protocols (more on this later), or swap them for other tokens if you need to make a quick exit.\n\nAsset Stader Liquid Staking Token Current Yield Total Value Locked (TVL) ETH ETHx 3.04% (50% promo boost paid in SD) $389,568,020 MATIC MATICx 5.15% $128,396,524 BNB BNBx 2.75% $20,262,829 HBAR HBARx 1.01% $35,328,193 All data as of February 21, 2024\n\nThere\u2019s also a governance token for the Stader protocol (SD). Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t need the Stader token to transact on the platform. The SD token can be used for voting on governance and in DeFi liquidity pools.\n\nThe SD token is also used by Stader as an incentive token when staking certain assets. For example, staked ETH currently earns about 2% in boosted SD rewards. This won\u2019t last forever.\n\nConnecting To Stader\n\nYou\u2019ll find support for top wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet (and several others), if you need to stake ETH, MATIC, BNB, or FTM. Assets like LUNA, NEAR, and HBAR that aren\u2019t EVM-compatible can use wallets for those blockchains, i.e. Blade or Hashpack for HBAR.\n\nIf you\u2019re staking ETH, as an example, it\u2019s likely you\u2019re already using one of the supported wallets.\n\nI was able to connect MetaMask, which was unsurprising, but also with Frame Wallet, which isn\u2019t explicitly supported.\n\nStaking (And Unstaking) With Stader\n\nStaking is just as easy as getting connected. And there\u2019s no minimum staking amount \u2014 as a technical matter. But transaction costs play a role. Staking smaller amounts probably won\u2019t be viable on pricier blockchains like Ethereum. It may cost more than you\u2019ll earn.\n\nStader\u2019s UI clearly displays the cost of the transaction as well as the exchange rate for the crypto you\u2019re staking.\n\nThe transaction cost is the blockchain fee for using the smart contract. Stader doesn\u2019t mark this up; it\u2019s market-driven and based on the complexity of the contract as well as network demand.\n\nIt\u2019s also not driven by how much you stake. You\u2019ll pay the same amount if you stake 0.001 ETH or 100 ETH: $7.21 in the example below.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this transaction cost is currently lower than both Lido and RocketPool, two other popular liquid staking protocols. I checked at different times of day with the same result: Stader had lower gas fees.\n\nThe savings suggest more efficient smart contracts are at work with Stader.\n\nLido\u2019s transaction cost, seen below, is higher. However, Lido gives you the option to use lower-cost Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Polygon, or Optimism if you hold ETH on those blockchains.\n\nLido also displays the reward fee, which is 10% on both Lido and Stader. In the interest of transparency, Stader should add that to the UI.\n\nThe reward fee isn\u2019t a secret, but it\u2019s also not as obvious as it could be on Stader.\n\nThe math is simple: If you earn $50 in staking rewards, Stader keeps $5, some of which they use to improve the protocol (per their documentation). You get the remaining $45, reflected in the annual staking rewards earnings.\n\nUnstaking is easy too, but pay attention to the transaction costs and wait times. The waiting period is determined by each blockchain. The transaction cost is just the fee for using the network to run the smart contract. But it can add considerable cost to the round-trip staking adventure.\n\nYou\u2019ll pay coming and going. And much like trying to leave NJ, where I live, the tolls are higher on the way out.\n\nAn Example\n\nIf you were to stake $1,000 worth of ETH, your annual yield would be about $57 dollars. If, after a year, you decide to unstake, the total transaction cost, including both staking and unstaking, would be about $40. This makes your effective yield about $17, or 1.7%.\n\nWorth it? Maybe. It depends on the amount you stake (and for how long).\n\nIf you\u2019re staking larger amounts, the transaction cost becomes a smaller factor relative to the yield, but it\u2019s something to consider when staking on Stader or other platforms.\n\nAlso, consider making your moves when network traffic is lower, which can help reduce gas fees.\n\nYou also have the option of swapping other assets for the staked tokens on a decentralized exchange, which may be a cheaper way to go. The liquidity pool isn\u2019t live yet, but soon you\u2019ll be able to swap ETH for ETHx on Uniswap.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the good news: If you\u2019re looking for a place to stake MATIC, Stader offers a superior solution. More on that in a bit.\n\nDeFi Integrations\n\nOne of the big advantages of liquid staking is that you can exit your position quickly through swaps on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap.\n\nThe other theoretical advantage is that you can use your liquid tokens on other protocols. Stader makes this more than just theory, providing links to other protocols and pools where you can put your liquid tokens to work immediately.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s what\u2019s available now for Polygon MATIC (MATICx) staking.\n\nLeveraged Staking: CIAN integration brings leverage to MATIC staking, resulting in a yield of 7% to 10%.\n\nCIAN integration brings leverage to MATIC staking, resulting in a yield of 7% to 10%.

The result: currently over 7% APY. Vaults: Olive provides a DeFi vault (basically a time-locked contract) that currently lets you earn almost 33% APY on your MATICx with automated options trades.\n\nFor ETHx, users can deposit into a vault with Sommerlier Finance (currently offering over 50% APY!), or a yield optimizer such as Pendle. Just to name a couple of examples. Stader Labs offers a selection of defi connections for all of their supported tokens, with a number of options for users to choose from.\n\nStader ETH Node Operators\n\nFor people who hold larger amounts of ETH (4 ETH minimum), Stader lets you get started as a node operator with a much lower commitment compared to solo staking.\n\nTypically, you need 32 ETH to go it alone, and current yields for solo staking are about 5%. With Stader, you can outperform solo yields with a low 4 ETH bond commitment. Stader node operators earn nearly 15% per year based on current incentives. A little over half of the yield is paid in SD, the Stader protocol token, which we\u2019ll discuss in a bit.\n\nAs the commitments get bigger, it\u2019s even more important to do your own research. Stader\u2019s ETH docs are a good starting point.\n\nStader\u2019s Hidden Gem (MATICx)\n\nIf you\u2019re a Polygon fan, you probably have a stack or two of MATIC you\u2019d like to put to work.\n\nThe problem: MATIC staking must be done on the Ethereum blockchain, which makes staking cost-prohibitive unless those stacks are pretty tall.\n\nStader fixes this. Now, you can stake MATIC on the Polygon network, dropping the transaction cost to nearly zero. Stader still takes a 10% cut of your staking rewards, but for many MATIC holders, this is a small price to pay. Currently, the yield is 5.1%.\n\nMATICx token\n\nAnd, as detailed in the section above, there are plenty of ways to boost your yields by deploying your MATICx in leveraged staking protocols, liquidity pools, or yield optimizers.\n\nSome of us are aspiring crypto whales, but we\u2019re not there just yet. Stader\u2019s MATIC liquid staking makes room for investors with small-but-growing stacks to earn a yield too.\n\nHow Stader\u2019s Liquid Tokens Work\n\nWhen you stake on Stader, you get \u201cx\u201d tokens in exchange for the tokens you stake.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll notice immediately is that this is not a 1-for-1 exchange.\n\nThat\u2019s because Stader\u2019s liquid staking tokens represent the yield on the tokens in addition to the value of the underlying token, like MATIC or ETH.\n\nOver time, the exchange rate changes as the tokens accumulate more earnings from yields. When it comes time to unstake, you\u2019ll get a larger amount of the base token than when you started.\n\nBy comparison to MATIC/MATICx, the exchange rate for the newly launched ETH token is much closer to 1:1. One ETH = 0.999 ETHx.\n\nThe number of liquid tokens you have won\u2019t change. Just the exchange rate changes. In effect, the yield is paid in price appreciation \u2014 a better exchange rate \u2014 for the liquid token.\n\nWith traditional staking, you\u2019ll typically earn more of the same token. So, if you staked $1,000 of ETH with a 5% yield, at the end of the year, you\u2019d have $1,050 worth of ETH. The dollar value assumes the price of ETH stays the same. (It won\u2019t.)\n\nThe benefit of liquid staking is that you can use the liquid tokens to earn additional yields in DeFi, sell them, use them as collateral, or just HODL. With traditional staking \u2014 which locks your tokens, the last option is really all you have: HODL.\n\nStader Token (SD)\n\nAs a decentralized protocol, Stader is run by the community. Holding SD tokens gives you the ability to vote on governance proposals for the project.\n\nThe tokens don\u2019t currently offer a yield unless you supply liquidity in a pool, but if you bought at the end of 2022, you\u2019ve already made a mint. SD traded at under $0.27 on December 31, 2022. By April 2023, SD reached $1.77. At press time, the SD token trades at over $0.82.\n\nThe total supply of the Stader token is fixed at 150 million. This gives a bit more weight to the token when used as an incentive, as seen in ETH staking. At least we know there won\u2019t be an endless river of SD tokens overflowing demand.\n\nStader Support\n\nStader is a decentralized protocol, so there\u2019s no toll-free number to call. If you have questions, the docs are usually the best place to start. If you\u2019ve read the docs and you\u2019re still stuck, there are several ways to reach out to the community and the team.\n\nWho\u2019s Stader For?\n\nInstitutions that hold crypto: Businesses and institutions that have a crypto investment can earn a yield without needing to trust a custodian. Stader\u2019s audits, on-chain monitoring, and bug bounty program all help ensure safer self-custody staking.\n\nBusinesses and institutions that have a crypto investment can earn a yield without needing to trust a custodian.

People who want to stake small amounts of ETH: The transaction cost to stake ETH through smart contracts like Stader, Lido, and others makes it cost-prohibitive to stake small amounts. As alternatives, you can consider staking MATIC on Stader or swap ETH for a liquid staking token.\n\nStader Alternatives\n\nStader Vs. Lido\n\nLido is still the leader in liquid staking, boasting about 75% market share. This dominance also leads to more DeFi opportunities, with Lido\u2019s stETH token in particular. However, Stader offers staking for more tokens, and the DeFi ecosystem for Stader\u2019s liquid staking tokens is growing.\n\nProtocol Liquid Staking Tokens Yields (Varies) Availability Integrations Top Features Stader ETH, MATIC, HBAR, BNB, NEAR, FTM, LUNA 3.5% to 15+%, depending on asset and network supply & demand Worldwide, except for sanctioned regions Curve, Balancer, Uniswap, Aave, Beefy, and more Wide range of assets offered across multiple chains + ability for leveraged yield\n\nLido ETH, MATIC, SOL 3.9% to 5.8%, depending on asset and network supply & demand Worldwide, except for sanctioned regions 1inch, Aave, Balancer, Beefy, Curve, MakerDAO, and more Massive ecosystem for stETHIntegrated aggregators to purchase stETH\n\nStader Vs. Coinbase\n\nStaking is big business for centralized exchanges like Coinbase. And it\u2019s easy. But it comes with some caveats, including higher staking fees (estimated at 20% on Coinbase) and the need to use Coinbase for custody rather than your own crypto wallet.\n\nProtocol Liquid Staking Tokens Yields (Varies) Availability Integrations Top Features Stader ETH, MATIC, HBAR, BNB, NEAR, FTM, LUNA 3.5% to 15+%, depending on asset and network supply & demand Worldwide, except for sanctioned regions Curve, Balancer, Uniswap, Aave, Beefy, and more SD token incentive for ETHSupport for liquidity pools\n\nCoinbase ETH, SOL, ADA, DOT, ATOM, XTZ 2% to 17.66%, depending on asset and network supply & demand Worldwide, except for sanctioned regions and certain US states Aave, Uniswap, Balancer, Beefy, and more Easy conversion from ETH to cbETHAvailable tax reports for staking earnings\n\nStader Vs. RocketPool\n\nUnlike Stader, which offers a variety of staking options, RocketPool is laser-focused on ETH staking. RocketPool came to popularity with its ability to run a node using only 8 ETH. Stader optimizes this further with a low 4 ETH bind requirement. Both offer liquid staking for ETH as well.\n\nProtocol Liquid Staking Tokens Yields (Varies) Availability Integrations Top Features Stader ETH, MATIC, HBAR, BNB, NEAR, FTM, LUNA 3.5% to 15+%, depending on asset and network supply & demand Worldwide, except for sanctioned regions Curve, Balancer, Uniswap, Aave, Beefy, and more SD token incentive for ETHSupport for liquidity pools\n\nRocketPool ETH 3.3% Worldwide, except for sanctioned regions Beefy, Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, Yearn, and more Socialized penalties to minimize single-user risk\n\nIs StaderLabs Safe To Use?\n\nStader\u2019s protocol centers on smart contracts, so that\u2019s probably the area that deserves the most consideration. Here\u2019s some background on the founders, audits, bounties, and the protocol\u2019s history.\n\nEngaging with any protocol, you take on smart contract risk. This is a risk for every protocol, not just Stader. And while they have a long list of audits and bug bounties live, there is still a small risk of their protocol being hacked. However, they have done a good job overall of covering their bases.\n\nFinal Thoughts On Stader\n\nStader\u2019s liquid staking has all the hallmarks of a future powerhouse in the space. Newer staking options, like ETH, currently offer fewer DeFi opportunities. But if you look at what Stader has done with MATIC, the future for ETH staking and whatever comes next (SOL?) could be bright with Stader.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Does Stader Do?
