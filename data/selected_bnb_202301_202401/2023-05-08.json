        "content": "Binance is one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges. In 2017, the exchange began offering services. It has more than 30 million users worldwide. The exchange is straightforward for customers and has a low transaction fee.\n\nUnlike other trading platforms, Binance expanded and created jobs during the weak and falling market of 2022. However, the exchange has been under scrutiny recently for numerous reasons.\n\nAlso read: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: May 2023\n\nBinance\u2019s official coin is BNB. Following the tribulations of the collapsing crypto market, it has fluctuated decently into 2022. If you are looking to stake your BNB and earn passive staking rewards while you sleep, here is how you can do it. Before that, let us look at BNB.\n\nBNB in a Nutshell\n\nBNB fulfills several functions inside the Binance ecosystem. It can be used to pay for Changpeng Zhao\u2019s exchange trading fees, engage in token sales via Binance Launchpad, gain access to premium features and services on the Binance platform, and more. Because of its link with Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, and its value within the Binance ecosystem, BNB has acquired substantial attention and appeal.\n\nAlso read: How to Mine Dogecoin (DOGE)?\n\nFurthermore, BNB has been built on its own blockchain, Binance Chain, which enables the production and issuance of tokens. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is yet another blockchain created by Binance that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts with BNB as the native currency. Binance has also launched BNB burning, helping to remove coins from the circulating supply.\n\nHow to Stake BNB?\n\nStaking is a straightforward process. You choose your validators, delegate, and stake your tokens, and you are good to go. Basically, you have to choose the right validator before staking your coins. You can check out the list of several validators and their performance and rewards from BSCscan.\n\nFor this guide, we will use the Trust Wallet app for staking purposes. There are different staking options, but let us look at how you can stake using the Trust Wallet app. Please ensure that you buy BNB before you proceed with the actions."

        "content": "If you are following the news of the crypto world, you would have heard about Collateral Network (COLT), which has stunned analysts with its presale performance. The market value of Collateral Network (COLT) is poised to jump by 100x in 2023. Meanwhile, Cosmos (ATOM) and Binance (BNB) are running out of fuel.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCosmos (ATOM) sees a decline in trading volume\n\nAlthough the Cosmos (ATOM) network has announced new developments in recent months, its volume has stayed the same.\n\nThe price of Cosmos (ATOM) has fallen by 11% in the past three months. Cosmos (ATOM) social metrics also look gloomy as bullish sentiments around the network have plummeted by 19%, while bearish sentiments have increased by 10% during the same period. Currently, Cosmos (ATOM) is available at $11.72.\n\nTo rebuild the hype around its network and reignite its bulls, Cosmos (ATOM) recently announced that its IBC-Solidity will expand to new blockchains in 2023. The deployment of IBC-Solidity will connect Cosmos (ATOM) and Ethereum, and facilitate the transfer of tokens, messages and data among different blockchains. However, experts believe that Cosmos (ATOM) needs to push on its development activity quickly before losing a significant market share.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBinance (BNB) eyes the Argentinian market\n\nAs Binance (BNB) and the U.S. authorities are getting hostile towards each other, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange has started targeting new countries to increase its footprint. Recently, Binance (BNB) expanded its services in Argentina, where the exchange will allow users to sell or buy digital currencies directly using pesos.\n\nAccording to analysts, Binance (BNB) can benefit from its expansion in Argentina, which is one of the best countries for crypto adoption. Interestingly, Argentina is the second South American country where Binance (BNB) seeks expansion. Earlier, Binance (BNB) partnered with the Brazilian Football Confederation to launch sports NFTs. Meanwhile, the market value of Binance (BNB) has plunged by 4% in the past month. Binance (BNB) is currently trading at $324.14.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) identified as the new Crypto king\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is the world\u2019s first platform that facilitates physical-assed-NTF-based crowdlending. Collateral Network (COLT) tokens are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, and the token contract is fully audited. Collateral Network (COLT) empowers people to borrow cash using tangible assets.\n\nWhile other Web3-based lending platforms accept only digital assets for giving loans, Collateral Network (COLT) gives loans on off-chain assets. Collateral Network (COLT) uses borrowers\u2019 physical assets to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs); thus, their value remains stable and immune to any negative market speculations. Then, the platform fractionalizes the NFT in pieces. Investors can buy these NFTs pieces to fund loans and become fractional lenders on Collateral Network (COLT).\n\nIf a borrower defaults to repay the loan, Collateral Network (COLT) will auction the physical asset, stored in one of its vaults for the duration of the loan, so the platform returns the investments to lenders.\n\nCOLT tokens offer several discounts and privileges to their holders, including discounts on transaction fees, staking rewards and access to auctions of distressed assets.\n\nThe presale price of COLT tokens started at $0.01 and has increased to $0.014. Analysts expect the project to jump by at least 35x during the presale round. COLT tokens are predicted to surge by 100x after they go live on crypto exchanges.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"

        "content": "Maximize Your BNB Holdings: A Step-by-Step Guide on How to Stake BNB on Metamask\n\nWelcome to the world of BNB staking! This guide will teach you how to stake BNB on Metamask to earn more tokens and make passive income.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s go over some basics.\n\nBNB, or Binance Coin, is a cryptocurrency created by Binance Exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nBNB was first an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain but migrated to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain developed by Binance.\n\nStaking is when users lock up their tokens to support the blockchain network and, in return, earn staking rewards.\n\nBy staking BNB on Metamask, you can earn rewards without actively trading or participating in the day-to-day operations of Binance Exchange.\n\nStocking BNB on Metamask can also help reduce your trading and transaction fees on the Binance platform.\n\nReady to learn more? Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nSource: Nexo.io\n\nWhat is a Metamask and what is its role in BNB staking?\n\nMetamask is a popular Ethereum-based wallet and browser extension that allows users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and manage their crypto assets.\n\nAlthough Metamask was initially designed for Ethereum, it now supports multiple blockchains, including the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nThis means you can hold and stake BNB on Metamask, making it an ideal platform for users who want to stake BNB without using Binance Exchange or for those who prefer an alternative to other wallets, such as Trust Wallet.\n\nBenefits of staking BNB on Metamask\n\nStaking BNB on Metamask offers several benefits.\n\nFirst, you can earn rewards in the form of BNB tokens. The amount of BNB you can earn depends on factors such as the number of tokens you stake, the duration of your staking period, and the current staking reward rates.\n\nSecond, another benefit of staking BNB on Metamask is that it reduces your reliance on centralized crypto exchanges. Some users prefer keeping their assets in a non-custodial wallet like Metamask for added security and control over their funds.\n\nMoreover, staking BNB on Metamask can also help you save on trading and transaction fees on the Binance platform. By holding BNB in your wallet, you can use it to pay for fees at a discounted rate, making your trading experience more cost-effective.\n\nSource: Liputan6\n\nHow do you stake BNB? A step-by-step guide\n\nReady to stake your BNB on Metamask? Follow this step-by-step guide to get started:\n\nInstall Metamask\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, install the Metamask browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Brave. You can download it from the official Metamask website.\n\nCreate or import a wallet.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to Metamask, create a new wallet by following the on-screen instructions. If you already have a wallet, import it using your seed phrase or private key.\n\nAdd Binance Smart Chain to Metamask.\n\nBy default, Metamask supports the Ethereum network. To stake BNB, you need to add the Binance Smart Chain to your Metamask wallet.\n\nTo do this, click on the network dropdown at the top of the Metamask interface, select \u201cCustom RPC,\u201d and enter the following details:\n\nNetwork name: Binance Smart Chain\n\nNew RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/\n\nChainID: 56\n\nSymbol: BNB\n\nBlock Explorer URL: https://bscscan.com/\n\nTransfer BNB to your Metamask wallet.\n\nYou must transfer some from another wallet or exchange if you don\u2019t already have BNB in your Metamask wallet. To do this, copy your Metamask wallet address and use it as the destination address for your BNB transfer.\n\nVisit a BNB staking platform.\n\nThere are several platforms where you can stake BNB using your Metamask wallet. Some popular options include Binance Staking, Pancake Swap, and Beefy Finance. Choose a platform that suits your needs and preferences.\n\nConnect your Metamask wallet.\n\nOn your chosen staking platform, click \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d and select \u201cMetamask\u201d from the list of available wallets. Grant the necessary permissions to link your Metamask wallet to the staking platform.\n\nSource: Coincu News\n\nStake your BNB\n\nOnce your wallet is connected, you can stake your BNB by following the platform-specific instructions. This usually involves selecting the BNB staking pool, entering the amount of BNB you want to stake, and clicking \u201cStake\u201d or a similar button.\n\nMonitor your staking rewards.\n\nAfter staking your BNB, you can monitor your rewards and track your earnings on the staking platform. Some platforms also offer additional features, such as auto-compounding or claiming rewards in other tokens.\n\nHow much can you make from staking BNB?\n\nThe amount you can make from staking BNB depends on several factors, including the number of tokens you stake, the duration of your staking period, and the current staking reward rates. In general, the more BNB you stake and the longer you hold it, the higher your potential rewards.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to research the specific staking platform you plan to use, as each platform has its reward structure and terms. Some platforms offer higher rewards for users who stake for longer periods, while others may provide additional incentives, such as governance tokens, referral bonuses, or access to exclusive features.\n\nHow to Unstake and Withdraw BNB\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to unstake and withdraw your BNB from Metamask, follow these steps:\n\nVisit the staking platform.\n\nReturn to the platform where you initially staked your BNB.\n\nConnect your wallet\n\nIf your wallet isn\u2019t connected already, click \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d and select \u201cMetamask\u201d from the list of available wallets.\n\nUnstake your BNB.\n\nNavigate to the BNB staking pool and click \u201cUnstake\u201d or a similar button. Depending on the platform, you may need to specify the amount of BNB you wish to unstake or confirm the transaction in Metamask.\n\nWithdraw your rewards.\n\nIf your staking rewards haven\u2019t been automatically claimed, you may need to withdraw them manually. Follow the platform-specific instructions to claim your rewards and transfer them to your Metamask wallet.\n\nTransfer your BNB\n\nIf you want to move your BNB to another wallet or exchange, simply initiate a transfer from your Metamask wallet to the desired destination address.\n\nHow does BNB staking work?\n\nBNB staking is when people lock up their BNB tokens to help the Binance Smart Chain network work better. By doing this, users help ensure transactions go smoothly and the network stays secure.\n\nWhen users stake their BNB, they receive rewards through more BNB tokens. The amount of reward they get depends on how much BNB they stake and how long they keep it staked. The rewards usually range from 5% to 20% each year. Some platforms even give extra rewards, like special features or tokens that let users vote on changes to the network.\n\nBNB staking is an easy way to make money from crypto without actively trading. It also helps support the Binance Smart Chain network, so it\u2019s a win-win situation for everyone.\n\nConclusion\n\nStaking BNB on Metamask is a great way to earn extra income and grow your BNB holdings. Follow the simple steps in this guide to start staking your BNB and earning rewards today. Just make sure to do your research before choosing a staking platform.\n\nStaking BNB on Metamask also has other benefits, such as lower fees, more control over your funds, and the potential for higher returns. Plus, you\u2019ll be helping make the Binance Smart Chain network stronger and more secure.\n\nSo don\u2019t wait any longer. Stake your BNB on Metamask and start earning rewards now!"
