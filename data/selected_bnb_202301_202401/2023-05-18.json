Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBinance\u2019s Australian branch today announced that it is \u201cunable to facilitate PayID deposits\u201d for its users.\n\nThe crypto exchange attributed the loss of the onramp \u201cto a decision made by our third-party payment service provider\u201d and says bank transfer withdrawals have also been affected.\n\nCuscal is reportedly the service provider in question. \"At Cuscal we are focussed on supporting the industry in protecting Australians from financial crimes and scams,\" a Cuscal spokesperson told Decrypt. \"We don\u2019t have a comment on any other parties at this point.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPayID is a domestic payments organization that lets users give a memorable piece of information to receive payments\u2013like mobile numbers or email addresses\u2013instead of bank account numbers.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard to find an alternative provider to continue offering AUD deposits and withdrawals to our users,\u201d the announcement read.\n\nThe news comes over a month after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) canceled the exchange\u2019s license for its derivatives business following a request from the exchange itself, which will use the winding down to \u201cpursue a more focused approach.\u201d\n\nBinance and PayID did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nChoppy waters for Binance\n\nThe world\u2019s busiest exchange is currently the subject of investigations by at least four different U.S. government agencies, including the SEC, DOJ, IRS and, most recently, the CFTC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in March, the leading derivatives regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), filed a lawsuit with a Chicago federal court accusing Binance of unauthorized derivatives trading by offering futures, swaps, and options on leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe suit also accuses the exchange of having insufficient anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) controls and allegedly evading or helping U.S. clients evade regulators.\n\nAt the end of April, reports emerged that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has hired lawyers to defend himself against the multiple legal threats.\n\nAround then, bankrupt crypto lender Voyager said Binance.US axed a deal to acquire the company\u2019s assets. Voyager was one of the high-profile casualties of Terra\u2019s collapse last May.\n\nIn a statement to Decrypt at the time, Binance cited \u201cthe hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States\u201d as the main reason behind the decision to back out."
