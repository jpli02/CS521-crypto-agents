        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSocial media platform Twitter has suspended the popular Dogecoin tipping bot that allowed users to tip creators in the leading meme-inspired cryptocurrency. Some fervent members of the DOGE community are now urging Twitter\u2019s new owner, Elon Musk, to check into it. The billionaire entrepreneur and Tesla/SpaceX CEO has been a major advocate for the coin.\n\nDogecoin Tipping Bot Suspended\n\nAn account created for a bot that facilitated Twitter-native tipping using Dogecoin has been suspended. A Twitter user going by the name Dogecoin Designer observed that Twitter had suspended the DOGE tipping bot \u201cfor no reason\u201d.\n\nThe user tagged Elon Musk while noting that the bot was a great way to circulate the token across the community. In particular, this bot let users send DOGE-denominated tips to their favourite content creators.\n\nAnother Dogecoin enthusiast, MyDogeCTO, posited that since Twitter has discontinued the only tool that allowed sending DOGE seamlessly to other users, the social media giant \u201cbetter be building something AWESOME for dogecoin.\u201d If the company does not add DOGE micropayments and tipping features, he further suggested, it would be a massive slap in the face for the DogeArmy.\n\nNotably, tips introduce Dogecoin to Twitter\u2019s ecosystem. Dogecoiners have remained hopeful that with Musk being the new owner of Twitter, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the microblogging platform begins to adopt the meme coin in one capacity or the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost recently, news emerged that Elon Musk plans to accommodate crypto in an upcoming Twitter payments system. The company has already started the application process for state-based regulatory licenses across the United States, which would allow it to introduce payments to the platform. Many Dogecoin superfans speculate that DOGE will be involved in some way.\n\nStill, whether Musk implements Dogecoin payments on Twitter in the near future is anybody\u2019s guess."

        "title": "Explained: Floki and why it could be the next victim of a cross-chain bridge attack - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Cross-chain bridges allow for the safe and secure transfer of tokens between different blockchains. As such, they are an essential part of the web3 ecosystem. However, these inter-chain communication protocols have also become easy targets for hackers, with billions of dollars being drained from crypto bridges over the last couple of years.In fact, a report by TRM Labs states that, as of November 2022, nearly $2 billion have been syphoned from 13 different cross-chain bridges. Now, another cross-chain bridge that could fall into the crosshairs of hackers is Floki Inu\u2019s Ethereum-BNB chain bridge. But what is Floki Inu and why is it a potential target for hackers? Tag along to find out.Floki Inu (FLOKI) is a meme coin named after Elon Musk\u2019s pet Shiba Inu (named Floki). However, unlike most other meme coin ecosystems, Floki aims to provide utility to its users. Therefore, instead of just being a means to store and transfer value, Floki Inu offers its users a staking interface, metaverse platform, NFT marketplace and a learning portal.The platform also partakes heavily in charity, with a vision to build schools in underdeveloped nations. Ironically, Floki Inu has also tied up with the Million Garden Campaign, which is an initiative by Elon Musk\u2019s brother, Kimbal Musk.The platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency, FLOKI, is a multichain token that is compatible with Ethereum and the BNB chain. Floki Inu uses a bridge to allow users to transfer assets on a 1:1 basis between the two chains. Users on Ethereum need to deposit their tokens into the bridge to receive an equal amount of tokens on BNB and vice versa.On January 30, the Floki DAO passed the proposal to take down the project\u2019s Ethereum-BNB bridge. In addition, the protocol will also burn over $100 million worth of FLOKI currently deposited on the bridge.As mentioned earlier, users need to submit their FLOKI on the bridge to receive an equal amount of tokens on the corresponding blockchain. Therefore, there are currently 3.8 FLOKI trillion locked on the BNB Chain, and 1.77 trillion Floki tokens are locked on Ethereum, adding up to 5.57 trillion FLOKI.However, 600 million of these tokens are funds deposited by the Floki Treasury to kick-start the bridge. These tokens will be returned to the treasury, while the remaining 4.97 trillion tokens, worth around $117 million, will be burned.The simple answer? To ensure they are not stolen by hackers. The 4.97 trillion tokens are not really worth anything. This is because, once they are deposited on the bridge, they are taken out of circulation and simply mirrored on the opposite chain. This keeps Floki\u2019s combined supply on both chains at 10 trillion tokens.However, simply taking down the bridge without burning these tokens could leave the protocol open to attack. Bad actors who manage to access these tokens may take them off the bridge and use them on either Ethereum or the BNB chain. This would also result in the maximum circulating supply of FLOKI swelling well beyond its stipulated 10 trillion tokens, causing its price to plummet.As per the project\u2019s proposal to take down the bridge, \"FLOKI has had more of a balance in the distribution of tokens between the ETH and BNB chain [\u2026.]. As a result of this, while the majority of the supply is still on the ETH chain there is now such a balance that the absence of a bridge would not threaten the stability of the project.\"Therefore, keeping the bridge up could result in a hack at some point in time. As such, the project has voted to take down the bridge and burn the tokens that are deposited on it. The burn is scheduled for 9th February and news of the tokens being taken out of circulation has resulted in 130 percent gains for Floki over the last week. This has pushed the token\u2019s YTD growth to 223 percent.Back in February 2022, Floki disabled its cross-chain bridge after it discovered an exploit that could put users at risk. Almost exactly a year later, the project is looking to permanently take down the bridge. This is because the project has established a balance of tokens on Ethereum and BNB. Therefore, keeping the bridge up could leave it susceptible to hacks which could lead to significant losses for the Floki Network. However, as long as the bridge is still up, there is always the real risk of an attack.At the time of writing FLOKI was trading at $0.00002612, up a further 9.3 percent over the last 24 hours. Its price could propel further once the tokens are burned. However, the crypto market is highly volatile, and tokens can defy even the strongest indicators. Therefore, it is important to do your own research and invest only as much as you can afford to lose completely."
