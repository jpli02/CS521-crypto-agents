        "content": "How to Invest in the Space ID (ID) IEO on Binance?\n\nBinance has announced that Space ID (ID) will be the next project featured on the Binance Launchpad platform. To become eligible for participating in the token sale, users need to hold BNB tokens on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. Binance will start recording BNB balances on March 2, and will be doing so until March 9. The Space ID team is looking to raise $2.5 million by selling 5% of the token's total supply. The ID tokens will be sold at the equivalent of $0.0025 each (the price will be set in BNB).\n\nSpace ID is a project that\u2019s focused on digital identities and domains for the web3 space. The Space ID platform allows users to register, trade and manage web3 domains, which are human-readable identities that are much more convenient to use than standard cryptocurrency addresses. The Space ID ecosystem supports web3 name services such as .eth, .bnb and .arb and boasts integrations with notable projects including BSCScan, Trust Wallet and others.\n\nHere's a quick recap of the timeline for the Space ID sale:\n\nStart End Preparation period March 17 (00:00 AM UTC) March 22 (06:00 AM UTC) Subscription period March 22 (06:00 AM UTC) March 22 (09:00 AM UTC) Calculation period March 22 (09:00 AM UTC) March 22 (10:00 AM UTC) Final token distribution March 22 (10:00 AM UTC) n/a\n\nHow to invest in the Space ID IEO on Binance Launchpad?\n\nThe Space ID sale on Binance Launchpad is available to users from supported countries. You will also have to hold some BNB and verify your BNB account if you want to participate.\n\n1. Create an account on Binance\n\nThe first step for participating in the token sale is to create an account on Binance.\n\nSign up to Binance\n\nHow to buy Binance Coin (BNB) on Binance?\n\nAfter you successfully register, go to the Launchpad section of the navigation menu. Now, you can see all the completed and upcoming IEOs on Binance.\n\n2. Verify your account\n\nIn order to participate in Binance Launchpad IEOs, you have to pass a know your customer (KYC) process. This is done to verify your identity and location, as residents of some countries are prohibited from buying tokens on Binance Launchpad.\n\nWe have already covered Binance\u2019s identity verification process in another guide. If you have any questions about the KYC process on Binance, you can find a step-by-step guide on the link below:\n\nHow and Why you Should do KYC on Binance?\n\n3. Select the Space ID IEO\n\nAfter you're verified, select Space ID from the list of upcoming and completed Binance Launchpad token sales.\n\n4. Space ID IEO requirements\n\nBinance introduced a new Launchpad subscription format that allows BNB holders to commit an amount of BNB towards a token sale, where their final allocation of the new token is determined by the ratio of their committed BNB against the total committed BNB by all participating users. To ensure a fair allocation for all participants, we will be setting a max cap of token allocation per user.\n\nIn order to be eligible for the Space ID IEO, you have to complete the identity verification process, accept the token purchase agreement, and be a resident of a supported country. Residents of these countries are not allowed to participate in the Space ID IEO:\n\nBelarus, People's Republic of China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Singapore, Sudan, Syria, United States of America and its territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), Zimbabwe.\n\nIf you pass all of these requirements, you can participate in the Space ID IEO and acquire ID tokens at the token sale price.\n\n5. Space ID IEO Subscription Timeline\n\nHere's how the timeline for the ID token sale on Binance Launchpad will work, as explained by Binance:\n\nMarch 17 (00:00 AM UTC) - March 22 (06:00 AM UTC) - Preparation period: In this phase, Binance takes hourly snapshots of the BNB holdings of each user. A user's average balance across these snapshots is used to determine how much BNB they can commit to the ID token sale.\n\nIn this phase, Binance takes hourly snapshots of the BNB holdings of each user.

If users do decide to commit BNB to the sale, they must sign the Token Purchase Agreement.\n\nImportant:\n\nPlease note that once committed, your BNB will be locked and you will not be able to redeem or access any other functions such as transfers, withdrawals or trading until final token distribution.\n\nMarch 22 (09:00 AM UTC) - March 22 (10:00 AM UTC) - Calculation Period: Subscriptions are closed, and the exchange calculates how many tokens will be distributed to each user.\n\nSubscriptions are closed, and the exchange calculates how many tokens will be distributed to each user. March 22 (10:00 AM UTC) - Final Token Distribution: The appropriate amount of BNB is deducted from the user's committed BNB and the user receives ID tokens.\n\nSign up to Binance\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nBinance announced that the subscription format will not be limited to Launchpad sessions going forward. It may be used for new listings, allowing users to purchase already-circulating tokens at a discount prior to the start of trading. For that reason, Binance may use average BNB balances calculated for a period prior to the time an announcement is made.
