        "title": "Inn of Saugatuck lists for $2.2M as owner plans to retire - Grand Rapids Business Journal",
        "content": "The Inn of Saugatuck has lived many lives in its 119 years, and its longtime owner Jane Verplank is ready for someone else to usher the place into a new era.\n\nVerplank listed the property in the 400 block of Butler Street for $2.2 million on Aug. 31 through her Realtor Kami Kennedy, with the Vis Realty Group of HomeRealty in Grand Haven.\n\nThe approximately 4,000-square-foot building currently is a bed-and-breakfast that features a main-floor half-bathroom; seven guest rooms, each with their own attached full bathroom; a third-floor owner\u2019s suite with a full bathroom; and a basement with another full bathroom.\n\nVerplank is well-known in the town of fewer than 900 year-round occupants situated on the Kalamazoo River and Lake Michigan. She served as Saugatuck\u2019s mayor from 2010-12, as a city council member for 14 years before that, and currently sits on the Fire District Board.\n\nKeep up with all things West Michigan business. Sign up for our free newsletters today.\n\nShe lives in the owner\u2019s suite and oversees the downtown B&B with the help of one other person who cleans on Sundays.\n\nDecades of commitment\n\nVerplank and her late husband, Bob, bought the building for $80,000 in 1979 when it was a funeral home. They ran Bob & Jane Verplank\u2019s Highbanks Art Gallery in the place for many years, then converted it to Saugatuck\u2019s Victorian Inn alongside the art gallery for several years.\n\nThey later closed the gallery and continued operating it solely as a B&B. Verplank rebranded it as The Inn of Saugatuck in 2017.\n\nAfter almost 45 years of owning the property and 28 years of running the inn, Verplank, 76, is ready to retire.\n\n\u201c(My husband) passed away about nine years ago, so I do it by myself now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have no idea how hard it is to retire until you have to do it. Selling the house is just gut-wrenching at times. But you have to move on, and you have to go to the next step in life.\u201d\n\nVerplank is selling the inn completely furnished, with the furniture included in the list price.\n\nCutting-edge for its time\n\nThe Saugatuck-Douglas History Center provided Crain\u2019s Grand Rapids Business with scans of a book called \u201cRaising the Roof: A History of the Buildings and Architecture in the Saugatuck and Douglas Area,\u201d by James Schmiechen (second edition, 2006).\n\nSchmiechen wrote that town merchant and local politician John Koning (1858-1927) built the Victorian Queen Anne-style house that\u2019s now the B&B in 1904 from a Sears-Roebuck mail-order kit.\n\nIt stood next door to his store, John Koning Hardware, which Koning acquired in 1894 from former owner John Nies, who opened it in 1868.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Koning\u2019s 1927 obituary, which also states Koning was a pillar of his community. He worked as a longtime director of the local Fruit Growers State Bank, was a school board member for 20 years and served several terms on the village council, including as village president in 1902.\n\nHis hardware store burned to the ground in the winter of 1903, partly because the fire department\u2019s hoses froze, Schmiechen wrote.\n\nWhen Koning rebuilt the hardware store in 1904, he decided to build a house for himself next door.\n\nThe former hardware store still stands beside the inn and now contains a gourmet kitchen provisions store called The Butler Pantry.\n\nThe home, which was one of the earliest Sears-Roebuck catalog prototypes, was shipped in pieces from Chicago by steamer. Like the 100,000 others who would go on to buy Sears-Roebuck kit homes over the next 40 years, Koning hired a local builder to assemble the house.\n\n\u201cEverything was included: lumber, lath, fireplace, kitchen cabinets, nails, flooring, and hardware, white paint for the exterior and red shingles for the roof!\u201d Schmiechen wrote.\n\nInvesting in updates\n\nVerplank said she loves the original features of the home, like the first-floor fireplace, bay windows, built-in sideboard and all the pocket doors.\n\nAround six or seven years ago, when she rebranded the inn, Verplank had all the carpets removed on a hunch she\u2019d find original hardwood floors underneath. She was right. The floors are made of quarter-sawn oak, a rarity these days which she had refinished.\n\n\u201cSince we did the floors, that\u2019s when the house really came to life,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just beautiful, and everybody that walks in the door always finds the floors beautiful.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Verplank estimates she and her husband spent hundreds of thousands of dollars restoring and renovating the home.\n\nThe crown moldings were crumbling, so they took a chunk to a business in Zeeland that restored the moldings based on that original piece. They freshened it up by re-staining all the trim. They added a beautiful glass extension on the kitchen that houses the long communal table where guests now eat breakfast. As well, Verplank recently replaced the roof to the tune of about $35,000.\n\nVerplank said she adores the \u201cbig, sweeping front porch,\u201d which she feels is the main selling point for a B&B. She also loves the location, one block from the river and one block from the heart of downtown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right across from the post office and kitty-corner from the Wickwood Inn,\u201d she said.\n\nA hub for regulars\n\nVerplank estimates she still hosts several hundred guests a year, even after shortening her B&B availability to three seasons because winter traffic wasn\u2019t as dependable with the warming climate and less snowfall for cross-country skiers.\n\nShe said it\u2019s been \u201cvery educational\u201d running a lodging house that draws people from so many backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of really, really nice people,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes, we have U.N. meetings. There\u2019s people from all over the world. Sometimes, rivalries, as far as Michigan and Michigan State goes. One time, I had two doctors from the same office stay here, and neither one of them knew the other was coming.\u201d\n\nVerplank said she has about a 75% return booking rate, acknowledging that she didn\u2019t know just how integral the inn was to her customers until she put it up for sale.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t realize how much they liked to come here, because now I\u2019m receiving gifts, and they\u2019re going, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re not really going to sell. We\u2019re not going to come to Saugatuck anymore if you\u2019re not here.\u2019 Or, \u2018Where can we stay in Saugatuck that\u2019s like this?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThe next chapter\n\nVerplank said she would like to see the inn carry on as a bed-and-breakfast, or be converted back to a single-family home.\n\n\u201cIt would be a cool vacation spot for a family,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d hate to see it turn into a seasonal rental because they seem to have taken over Saugatuck in force. \u2026 You don\u2019t see kids in the neighborhood anymore, so it\u2019s kind of sad. I would love to see the house come alive with laughter and family gatherings.\u201d\n\nEither way, since the home is in a historic district, the buyer will need to preserve the exterior as it is, she said.\n\nVerplank added if the buyer decides to keep it a B&B, her competitors at other lodging establishments in town would like to see the prices raised from their current range of $185-$275 a night, to be on par with the going rates for their rooms.\n\n\u201cLast year, I raised everything at least $50 and a few of them more than that. And nobody even blinked an eye. I was quite surprised,\u201d she said.\n\nFor the buyers\n\nKennedy, the seller\u2019s agent, said she set the list price at $544 per square foot based on comparable sales of similar-sized homes built around the same time, combined with the amenities and location.\n\nThe property listed right around back-to-school time, which she acknowledged is a challenging time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a little bit of a lull right now, and this always happens this time of year in real estate,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite that, the property had garnered several calls from interested parties and thousands of views and saves on Zillow as of Sept. 21. Kennedy has not yet scheduled any showings or received any offers.\n\nShe said it\u2019s likely that if it doesn\u2019t sell by winter, they\u2019ll leave the listing up and see what happens when the weather changes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re marketing to a lot of investors \u2026 out-of-state, in-state, Realtors all over the state of Michigan, (and) we have some different tools that we use to get newsletters in the hands of people,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe\u2019re just continuing the marketing efforts and hoping for that perfect person.\n\n\u201cThat location downtown is prime, prime real estate.\u201d\n\nMore from Crain\u2019s Grand Rapids Business:\n\nBagel shop plans second location on Grand Rapids\u2019 west side\n\nCaledonia health care products maker acquires N.Y. firm\n\nFamily Promise of West Michigan acquires two mobile home parks for affordable housing"

        "title": "Could Microsoft revolutionize the crypto market? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The latest speculation about Microsoft speaks volumes: a crypto leak reveals the tech giant\u2019s possible impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and BNB.\n\nSpecifically, details have emerged about Microsoft\u2019s alleged intention to integrate the blockchain segment into its future Xbox.\n\nSee below for all the details.\n\nThe role of Microsoft in the evolving crypto market: what is happening?\n\nBased on the latest data, we see that the major cryptos, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and BNB, are currently in a sideways trading period as the market prepares for the upcoming $17.7 trillion Wall Street earthquake and is growing rapidly.\n\nThis situation was triggered by the Federal Reserve starting its financial tightening cycle at the end of 2021.\n\nNow, there is a risk that this could negatively impact not only the price of Bitcoin but also the broader cryptocurrency market, valued at $1 trillion, including Ethereum, XRP, BNB and others.\n\nMeanwhile, a sudden reversal in Bitcoin\u2019s fortunes is keeping traders in suspense as Elon Musk prepares to make a surprising move.\n\nAt the same time, some speculations have come in which reveal that Microsoft, the tech giant, is planning to incorporate support for cryptocurrencies in its upcoming Xbox console.\n\nThis news has emerged thanks to internal Microsoft documents that were posted this week on Resetera, a gaming forum. These documents show a roadmap for Xbox dated May 2022, which includes the integration of crypto wallets.\n\nThe massive leak was attributed to documents related to the lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission, which aims to block Microsoft\u2019s $69 billion bid to acquire Activision Blizzard, before the transaction is formalized.\n\nWhat do documents related to Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard say\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Xbox chief Phil Spencer reported that several documents related to the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard were accidentally leaked. Spencer pointed out that while this is disappointing, many of these documents are over a year old and that the company\u2019s plans have evolved in the meantime.\n\nThe new \u201cecosystem generation,\u201d which includes consoles, phones, web browsers, a handheld system, PCs and a \u201ccloud console,\u201d as well as support for artificial intelligence and machine learning, is scheduled for release no earlier than 2028 and may undergo further changes.\n\nSpencer expressed his frustration at seeing his team\u2019s work made public in this way, as many things have changed and there are exciting developments both in the present and in the future.\n\nHe also promised that the actual plans will be shared when they are ready.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors and speculation have been circulating about the interest of high-profile companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, Alphabet, and Meta (ex-Facebook) in implementing support for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile large Wall Street financial institutions such as BlackRock and JPMorgan have been cautious in the crypto world, Silicon Valley companies appear to have been swayed by Facebook\u2019s failure to launch its own Bitcoin-based stablecoin.\n\nIn 2019, global regulators and central banks collaborated to block Meta\u2019s plans for a private global cryptocurrency, fearing that the company could compete with the Federal Reserve\u2019s economic power if it was allowed to issue a currency for its more than 3 billion users worldwide.\n\nMicrosoft reduces investment in AI chips, why?\n\nRecently, Microsoft announced that it would reduce its investment in research and development of artificial intelligence chips, news that jolted the entire technology community.\n\nA question then arises: does this move signal broader problems in the artificial intelligence industry?\n\nAs we know, the artificial intelligence chip market has seen explosive growth, with companies rushing to create specialized hardware to meet the growing demand.\n\nIn this context, Microsoft\u2019s decision to cut investment in this direction seems counter-cultural. However, it is important to understand that market dynamics are not homogeneous, and each player has its own unique strategy.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft\u2019s choice may not necessarily signal a crisis in the industry, rather it may represent a strategic move. On the other hand, the tech giant is known for its ability to adapt and diversify.\n\nWith this in mind, scaling back investment in artificial intelligence chips could be interpreted as a redirection of resources to other promising technology areas, such as cloud computing and software development.\n\nIn this regard, The Motley Fool, famous for its shrewd analysis of the stock market, recently shared its assessment of Microsoft\u2019s current position. Interestingly, Stock Advisor\u2018s prestigious team of analysts did not list Microsoft among the top ten stocks recommended for investors at this time.\n\nAlthough Microsoft\u2019s choice arouses curiosity, it is essential to avoid looking at the entire artificial intelligence sector solely in relation to a single company\u2019s strategy.\n\nThe artificial intelligence landscape remains dynamic, with numerous players making significant investments and progress.\n\nIndeed, companies such as NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD continue to be at the forefront of innovation and growing presence in the artificial intelligence chip market."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIf you are about to infuse in the crypto world, this article may help you in the venture. A new project, Pomerdoge, has been dominating the crypto world with its immense profitability.\n\nHence, holders of ApeCoin (APE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) have also started moving to the side of this new project.\n\nSummary\n\nThe market price of ApeCoin (APE) has declined by 28%.\n\nFloki Inu (FLOKI) is 95% down from its all-time high value.\n\nPomerdoge\u2019s presale price has increased to $0.0165.\n\nBAYC\u2019s NFT Downfall Hurts ApeCoin\u2019s (APE) Prospects\n\nA severe downfall of Board Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs has caused a steep decline in the value of ApeCoin (APE). The latest on-chain data suggests that the floor price of BAYC, an NFT collection in the ApeCoin (APE) ecosystem, has dropped by 21% in the past week.\n\nThis has caused an increase in the bearish sentiments around ApeCoin (APE). Subsequently, as Santiment\u2019s data suggests, the number of ApeCoin (APE) users has also plummeted. Besides, it has led to a significant drop in the price of ApeCoin (APE).\n\nOver the past 30 days, ApeCoin\u2019s (APE) market value has declined by 28%. Thus, the current trading price of an ApeCoin (APE) token has come down to $1.42.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFloki Inu (FLOKI) Loses Confidence\n\nAmid the overall bearish market conditions, nothing seems to be working in favor of Floki Inu (FLOKI). The market standing of Floki Inu (FLOKI) is constantly following a declining trend. In the past 30 days, the market value of Floki Inu (FLOKI) has plummeted by 24%.\n\nSubsequently, the price of a Floki Inu (FLOKI) token has come down to $0.0000172. With this, Floki Inu (FLOKI) is trading 95% below its all-time high of $0.00033651.\n\nAn absence of development activity has been a primary reason behind the recent fall of Floki Inu (FLOKI). The last update Floki Inu (FLOKI) took to expand its ecosystem was to collaborate with BitGo, many weeks ago. Hence, investors are losing interest in Floki Inu (FLOKI).\n\nPomerdoge (POMD) Records Exceptional Presale Success\n\nPomerdoge is a new P2E (play-to-earn) crypto project that has made the blockchain gaming market more accessible and profitable. This new meme coin boasts a unique business roadmap and market viability and can soon outrun Pepe, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin in growth. Some reports have shown that the global blockchain gaming industry can reach more than $1,020 billion by 2032.\n\nAn experienced team has designed this P2E meme coin. The platform will combine the impressive features of play-to-earn tokens and meme coins. Moreover, the three elements that will make up its ecosystem are Pomergame, Pomerplace, and a collection of NFTs. In Pomerplace, players from across the world will get a chance to play and earn together.\n\nUsers can also create and level their avatars through customized in-game items. Pomerplace has been unveiled to facilitate the trade of in-game assets between players. It will provide players with an ecosystem to buy, sell, and trade their customized assets.\n\nPOMD is the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency. This P2E gaming platform has raked in more than $4.80 million during its ongoing presale phase. According to market gurus, the platform\u2019s price can jump by 1,700% before the end of the presale phase. Currently, the presale tokens are selling out fast, and the price of a POMD is $0.0165, a surge of over 120% from its starting price of $0.007.\n\nWebsite: https://pomerdoge.com/\n\nTelegram Community: https://t.me/pomerdoge\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.
