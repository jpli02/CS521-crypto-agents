        "content": "This may shock you \u2013 but in the wintertime, New England used to get snow.\n\nYes, we\u2019ve gotten some flurries this winter. But they stayed on the ground about as long as Mac Jones will wind up staying in Foxboro.\n\nBack in the old days, when winter was winter, New Englanders would partake in this activity known as \u201cbuilding snowmen\u201d \u2013 or, snowwomen! It all depends on your placement of the carrot.\n\nIn fact, there was once so much snow, Mainers were able to build some really, really tall snowpeople \u2013 so large, they wound up in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nBuilt in Bethel in 1999, Maine's Angus, King of the Mountain measured 113 feet, seven inches \u2013 or 10 stories \u2013 or, almost as tall as Maine Red Claws legend Tacko Fall. The Snowman was comprised of 8 million pounds of snow.\n\nNamed for Maine\u2019s then-Governor, Angus King (he's a person, not a burger at McDonald\u2019s), Angus the Snowman lived on until he melted away that June.\n\nBut as is the case with a certain New England-shot movie franchise that Stephen Spielberg now apparently regrets\u2026you never stop at one when you can go for a sequel.\n\nIn 2008, Bethel introduced the world to Olympia SnowWoman\u2026\n\nBethel Area Chamber of Commerce via Facebook. Bethel Area Chamber of Commerce via Facebook. loading...\n\nHeight really does increase with every generation, as Olympia stood 122 feet, one inch (or, 11 stories). That\u2019s 13 million pounds of snow (but nothing some Spanx can\u2019t take care of). And, a new Guinness World Record.\n\nNamed after then-Maine Senator Olympia Snowe (because you kind of have to), Olympia SnowWoman lasted until July 30, 2008. Happy Frost of July!\n\nBut like snowmen, records don\u2019t stand forever. In 2020, Austria earned that distinction when it unleashed Riesi (which translates to \u201cgiant\u201d in English), reaching just under 125 feet. (But if what they say about Arnold Schwarzenegger wearing lifts is true, you have a right to be skeptical about the height of a guy from Austria.)\n\nIt could be difficult to build such a large snowman or snowwoman or snowperson, as the region could be on the verge of making history with its mild 2022-23 winter.\n\nBut, as veteran meteorologist Mark Rosenthal cautions, that could just mean Mother Nature gets even with us in the spring. Could we see a back-to-school snowman??\n\nAnd what if it came to life? Sounds like a great idea for Maine's most reclusive novelist, the mysterious Richard Bachmann.\n\nThis Maine Home for Sale is 2 Houses Down the Street from Stephen King"

        "content": "No one may have told you life was gonna be this way, but these two one-of-a-kind Cincinnati apartments you can rent may make up for it.\n\nFans of \u201890s sitcoms Friends and Seinfeld will love these themed rentals. Retro Retreats, formerly The Sitcom Suites, aren\u2019t just full of memorabilia, but instead resemble real-life set replicas, making you feel like you\u2019re a star in the show.\n\nBrenda and Otto Baum are behind the nostalgia-fueled apartments. Brenda told CityBeat via email that being stuck at home during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic sparked the idea.\n\n\u201cAbout three years ago, COVID lockdowns had just begun. Sports, which is my husband's passion, had officially been canceled and we found ourselves with a whole lot of time. We started rewatching a lot of old television. Otto is an owner in a property development company and thought, \u2018How cool would it be to recreate an actual set?\u2019\" said Brenda. \u201cWith love of old TV, architecture, eye for design and drive for a new date night spot, the [Retro Retreats] idea was born.\u201d\n\nThe apartments are located in the Baums\u2019 neighborhood, Pleasant Ridge. Brenda said the proximity to them would make it easier to manage the listings, and Pleasant Ridge has a lot to offer guests.\n\n\u201cPleasant Ridge has bars, restaurants, coffee shops, comic book and record stores and is also central to everything else the city has to offer,\u201d Brenda told CityBeat.\n\nBoth units are located in a four-family apartment. The Friends-themed one, The Purple Suite, mimics characters Monica\u2019s and Rachel\u2019s New York City apartment, complete with the kitchen\u2019s turquoise cabinetry, purple living room and the large picture window with views of \u201cNYC.\u201d The Seinfeld-themed one, The New York Suite, likewise looks like Jerry\u2019s New York City apartment with a bike on the wall, a toy basketball hoop on the door, a New York state license plate reading \u201cASSMAN\u201d and a cutout of neighbor Cosmo Kramer.\n\nBrenda said bringing Otto\u2019s idea to reality was the fun part in creating Retro Retreats.\n\n\u201cThe current apartment layouts are far from similar to those on the shows, so \u2018set\u2019 walls were built to block windows, faux doors were brought in and the light fixtures were chosen to replicate set camera lights. While Otto and his team are building the units, I have been hunting down the exact furniture and fixtures which have taken me all over the country and have some crazy stories. These units are truly unlike anything else,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth apartments are one-bedrooms with king-sized beds, pull-out couches in the living rooms and fully equipped kitchens. For parents staying with kids, there is a rec center with a playground, pool and splash pad across the street from the building.\n\nRetro Retreats also now has rooms based on the motel rooms in Schitt's Creek and The Golden Girls' Miami home. All rentals start at $185 a night.\n\n\n\nMore info: retroretreatscincy.com."

        "title": "Le Chateau Bed & Breakfast's new owners hope to honor legacy - Wisconsin Rapids Tribune",
        "content": "WISCONSIN RAPIDS \u2013 A new family is adding to the 134-year-old legacy of the Arpin house on First Street North in Wisconsin Rapids.\n\nMike and Rachel Stormoen are the new owners of the house and have continued operating Le Chateau Bed & Breakfast at 840 First St. N. in Wisconsin Rapids. The previous owners \u2013 Bill and Faye Collier \u2013 owned the house since 2015 and opened its doors as a bed and breakfast in 2016.\n\nWhile both Mike and Rachel grew up in Wisconsin Rapids, Rachel was always drawn to the historic three-story house with a wrap-around porch that stands along the river. But it wasn\u2019t always the brown-and-tan house that people recognize today.\n\nRachel said she grew up in the neighborhood and would go for walks with her mother. She said she remembers walking by the house that had been painted \"an ugly green color\" with a huge teddy bear looking out a third-floor window, and she told her mom, \u201cI\u2019m going to own that someday.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a conversation Rachel\u2019s mom reminded her of when she and Mike bought the house in August.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever let someone tell you your dreams are silly,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cBut then don\u2019t sit in that dream state. Do it.\u201d\n\nMore:Wisconsin Rapids' top business stories of 2022: Shopko, Kwik Trip and paper industry\n\nMore:Wisconsin Rapids development projects to watch in 2023: Shopko building, hospital, jail\n\nAll roads led back home.\n\nRachel said she and Mike were a little nervous to run the bed and breakfast out of that home, but it felt like everything up to that point led the whole family toward that opportunity.\n\nA study abroad opportunity in school sparked interest in travel and international studies in Rachel, leading her to work on a five-star cruise ship. There, she learned how to serve meals, set tables and make beds to a high standard \u2013 all skills beneficial in running a bed and breakfast. Later, a job at a chocolate company in Madison gave her experience planning events. An entrepreneur class taught her how to build a business plan, and an assignment for that class led to Rachel opening a wedding planning business.\n\nWhile living in Madison, Rachel said she felt a pull to be closer to home. The Stormoen family, with three children at the time, moved back to Grand Rapids. Mike and Rachel began looking into running a rental home with Airbnb and talked about starting that opportunity in 2023 when Le Chateau came up for sale.\n\nAs soon as she saw the listing, Rachel said she felt she and her family had to go for it. It was not quite what she and her husband had planned, and it was sooner than they expected, but she felt it was a great opportunity that might not come up again anytime soon. She said she prayed about the decision when she saw the listing, and then told her husband, hoping he\u2019d be open to considering it. He agreed, and they closed on the sale in August and moved in at the beginning of October.\n\nRachel said her husband has always been her foundation and rock, working with her to make her dreams come true. She said there were a lot of bumps in the road that led to running Le Chateau, but it\u2019s all been worth it to be able to raise their family there.\n\nIt\u2019s all about community, connections and memories.\n\nRachel said she has always had a passion for community, no matter where she\u2019s lived. She said she wants to actively add value to wherever she\u2019s living, especially as she and her husband are raising four children.\n\nThat sense of community means that much more to Rachel as she and Mike are raising their kids where they themselves grew up. Rachel said she had a great childhood, and she\u2019s looking forward to raising her kids in the same way she was, just down the street from where she spent her youth. The family lives at the Le Chateau home, with their family quarters on the third floor with a view of Rachel's childhood home.\n\nRachel said they want to bring the community together and offer events and experiences for people to build memories.\n\n\u201cThe Stormoen family wants you to come in and make memories here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I can use my house to do so, welcome. Come on in.\u201d\n\n\u2018This house is made for memories.\u2019\n\nLe Chateau builds on the legacy of John Arpin\u2019s home. John Arpin, whose family owned the John Arpin Lumber Company in Arpin, had the house built for his wife, Clarice, in 1889. She named it Le Chateau, and it was one of the first modern homes in the area to have electricity, running water and a telephone at the time.\n\nThroughout the years, the home stood as multiple apartments and was sold multiple times before it was refurbished from 2004 to 2008. When Bill and Faye bought the home, they wanted to honor the history as they opened the bed and breakfast. The Stormoen family wants to continue honoring the history of the home, as well as some of the newer bed and breakfast traditions.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right to buy it and shut the doors,\u201d Rachel said.\n\nShe said she wanted to continue to give guests and community members what they\u2019ve loved over the past few years, while also finding ways to make their experiences even better. Rachel brought her knowledge from wedding planning to the bed and breakfast, offering it as a venue for intimate weddings, as well as a space for events, luncheons and more. Rachel said she wants to be accessible to the community, too, offering monthly events for the public to enjoy.\n\n\u201cThis house is made for memories,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat can you expect?\n\nOne tradition Le Chateau started as the bed and breakfast was its Christmas tree tours. People could take tours through the home and see dozens of Christmas trees decorated in various themes.\n\nIt\u2019s a tradition Rachel said will continue. This year, the family set up 67 trees and told stories of the home\u2019s history as they led tours through the home. In the future, Rachel wants to create more experiences, pairing tours with weekly events.\n\nBreakfast is a special event at Le Chateau, as well. Mike runs breakfasts and comes up with a different menu each day. Food is set up on the table family-style, allowing guests to pick whichever foods they want. Rachel said they try to offer something savory, something sweet and something in between during those breakfasts. Mike and Rachel wanted breakfast to feel like a family affair, like going to Grandma\u2019s house for a homemade breakfast.\n\nBeyond the bed and breakfast stays, Le Chateau will host monthly events open to the community, like a Murder Mystery Dinner, Valentine Date Dinner or a Paint and Snack event. Rachel said she\u2019s also planning a Hollywood-themed event with a red carpet and glamor for later this summer. The bed and breakfast partners with Derrie\u2019s Foodworks Catering Co. for some events, as well.\n\nPeople can find events on Le Chateau\u2019s Facebook page or website, or through the Wisconsin Rapids Area Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nFor more information, visit themanorwisconsin.org or find Le Chateau Bed & Breakfast/The Manor on Facebook.\n\nContact Caitlin at cshuda@gannett.com or follow her on Twitter @CaitlinShuda."
