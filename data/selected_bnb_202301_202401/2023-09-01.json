        "content": "BTC\n\nRecent hours have seen major cryptocurrency assets, including ETH and BTC, retracing upward moves made in the wake of Grayscale\u2019s victory over the SEC.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are down 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively, over the 24-hour, at time of writing, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nOther major cryptocurrencies such as BNB Chain (BNB) and Ripple (XRP) have also experienced sudden and sharp declines.\n\nCryptocurrency prices are falling once again. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\n\u200dRecent Bullish News Not Enough?\n\nRecent updates regarding Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit victory over the SEC, as well as additional news that involved both a Uniswap lawsuit being dismissed, as well as a US judge hinting at Ethereum\u2019s commodity-type nature, has failed to prevent the cryptocurrency markets from slipping back into the red.\n\nSome analysts have pointed to September as a historically bearish month for the digital asset markets, but hope remained prevalent among many pundits. The sudden drop is a stark reminder of just how treacherous and risky the cryptocurrency markets can be."

        "title": "Top Crypto Analyst Says Binance Coin (BNB) Flashing \u2018Savage\u2019 Bearish Signal \u2013 Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto trader is warning that Binance Coin (BNB) is on the verge of collapsing against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nBluntz tells his 224,500 followers on the social media platform X that the BNB/BTC trading pair has formed a bearish swing failure pattern (SFP).\n\nA swing failure pattern in an uptrend typically occurs when price makes a series of higher highs and higher lows, but at some point fails to make new highs and sell-side pressure begins to mount, hinting at a bearish reversal.\n\nSays Bluntz,\n\n\u201cBNB is still top of the priority list for shorts. [There was a] savage SFP on BNB/BTC yesterday and the USD pair simply looks like an A-B-C [correction] up still.\n\nAlso, [BNB] has the most horrendous high timeframe chart in my opinion.\u201d\n\nAn ABC correction, part of Elliot Wave theory, is a simple three wave move in the opposite direction of the trend. In this case, Bluntz thinks BNB\u2019s strength in late August was a correction upward in its longer term downtrend.\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he suggests that BNB could decline below the key $200 level around September 2nd, retest the $210 level near September 4th and then decline to about $196 by September 6th.\n\nThe trader\u2019s bearish BNB prediction dates back more than eight months ago.\n\nHe previously said,\n\n\u201cI think the five-year uptrend in BNB/BTC has come to an end. IMO it comes down at minimum another 40%-50% from here. [I] genuinely don\u2019t even know where that would put the BNB/USD price but I\u2019ll be avoiding this coin like the plague from here. GL (good luck) if you hold it.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested months ago that BNB could decline to as low as $80, which would be a more than 63% decline from its current value.\n\n\u201cIf I had to guess, USD pair is heading to between $80-$100.\u201d\n\nBNB is trading for $217 at time of writing, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Here are the possible reasons:\n\nDelayed from block confirmation\n\nYou can check if you've input the correct deposit information and your transaction status on the blockchain. If your transaction is on the blockchain, you can check if your transaction reaches the required confirmation numbers. You will receive your deposit amount once it reaches the required confirmation numbers.\n\nIf your deposit can't be found on the blockchain, you can reach out to your corresponding platform's customer support for assistance.\n\nDeposit different cryptos\n\nBefore you submit a deposit request, make sure that you've selected the crypto supported by the corresponding platform. Otherwise, it could lead to deposit failure.\n\nIncorrect address and network\n\nBefore you submit a deposit request, make sure that you've selected the network supported by the corresponding platform. Otherwise, it could lead to deposit failure.\n\nFor example, you would like to deposit ETH to a BTC address that is not compatible. This can lead to deposit failure.\n\nIn such a case, you can reach out to our customer support for assistance.\n\nThe crypto that you want to deposit might require filling in a memo/tag/comment. You can find it on the OKX deposit page.\n\nIf you find a tag, enter the tag in the Tag field on the corresponding platform's withdrawal page. If you can't find the Tag field on the corresponding platform, you can reach out to the corresponding platform's customer support for assistance.\n\nNote: If you enter an incorrect/missing tag, it could lead to deposit failure. In such a case, you can reach out to our customer support for assistance.\n\nDeposit to smart contract addresses\n\nBefore you submit a deposit request, make sure that you've selected the deposit contract address supported by the corresponding platform. Otherwise, it could lead to deposit failure.\n\nBlockchain reward deposits\n\nThe profit from mining can only be deposited into your wallet. You can only deposit the rewards into the OKX account once it is deposited into your wallet, as OKX doesn't support blockchain reward deposits.\n\nCombined deposits\n\nWhen you want to do a deposit, make sure you submit only one deposit request each time. If you submit multiple requests into a single deposit transaction, you'll not receive your deposit. In such a case, you can reach out to our customer support for assistance.\n\nFail to reach the minimum deposit amount\n\nBefore you submit a deposit request, make sure that you deposit at least the minimum amount which you could find on our OKX deposit page. Otherwise, it could lead to deposit failure."
