Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA woman who has refused to leave a Los Angeles-area Airbnb is now demanding to be paid $100,000 to get out, according to a settlement offer reviewed by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe host, Sascha Jovanovic, said the woman\u2019s stay was scheduled to end in April 2022, but she then refused to move out. Elizabeth Hirschhorn, dubbed as the \u201ctenant from hell\u201d, has been living rent-free ever since.\n\nMr Jovanovic, who owns the estate where the homestay is located in the hills of Brentwood, told the Times he cannot go into his home and \u201cknow that I\u2019m safe when a potentially hostile person is living there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it at all times,\u201d he added.\n\nHirschhorn declined to speak to the outlet to share her side of the story; however, her attorney, Colin Walshok, argued that she was not required to pay rent.\n\n\u201cThe landlord broke the law and tried to make money by renting out an illegal bootleg unit,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cAfter he was caught, instead of doing the right thing, he has resorted to bullying, harassment and the filing of frivolous lawsuits containing elaborate false stories, all in attempt to cover his tracks.\u201d\n\nAfter deciding to put out his small guesthouse for rent, Mr Jovanovic approved a long-term stay for Ms Hirschhorn in September of 2021.\n\nThe space was rented for six months at a rate of $105 per night, which with fees brought the total to $20,793 for 187 nights.\n\nThe pair got on well in the beginning, sharing tea and small talk, but there were some warning signs that Mr Jovanovic said he should have listened to.\n\nAnother Airbnb host had put out a review on Ms Hirschhorn\u2019s profile that said \u201cshe had a lot of particular needs that I eventually could not accommodate.\u201d\n\nAnd then, Mr Jovanovic claims, he went into the guesthouse to check on electric blinds that had stopped working and noticed there was water damage and signs of mould around the sink, problems he says were not there before Hirschhorn arrived.\n\nWanting to repair the sink and stop the spread of mould, the landlord said he offered to pay his guest to stay at a hotel for a few days and also offered $1,000 toward a hotel of her choice, according to Airbnb messages and emails exchanged between the two.\n\nHowever, Ms Hirschhorn declined, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe being forced to vacate with a housing disability and the high risks of Covid-19 complications.\u201d She then quoted L.A. County\u2019s Covid-19 Tenant Protections Resolution and showed a 2011 doctor\u2019s note pointing out chemical sensitivities.\n\nIn addition, the emails showed he had also offered her to stay in his home, which she declined.\n\nMs Hirschhorn is now counter-suing Mr Jovanovic and claims that he \u201cinappropriately invited\u201d her to move into his house with him.\n\nMs Hirschhorn\u2019s Airbnb stay was scheduled to end on 19 March; however, Mr Jovanovic offered her a month\u2019s extension in order to find somewhere else to live, something that backfired on him because Airbnb was then free from getting involved in the dispute.\n\n\u201cOnce everything went to hell, Airbnb was out,\u201d said Sebastian Rucci, an attorney representing Mr Jovanovic, according to the Times.\n\nThen came the new deadline and Ms Hirschhorn stayed put. In an email, she said: \u201cI can\u2019t leave on Apr. 12 as relocation and funding plan is not in place, it would be unsafe. If you want to work something out I am willing to do that.\u201d\n\nSince then, she has not paid any rent and she still remains \u2014 over 540 days later \u2014 having claimed in a May 2022 email that \u201cYour actions and alleged repairs are made knowing that of my disability requiring accommodation, I believe it was made to harass and scare me.\u201d\n\nMr Jovanovic tried serving multiple eviction notices, but a housing department investigator, Pedro Gonzalez, said Mr Jovanovic had to withdraw his eviction notices as the building did not comply with the city\u2019s building-safety rules.\n\nBut Ms Hirschhorn refused to let the host inside the property so it could be updated to comply with the city\u2019s building codes.\n\nMr Jovanovic is incredulous, telling the Times: \u201cHow can you stay in someone\u2019s home for a year and a half and not have any feeling of embarrassment or responsibility?\u201d\n\nThe Independent has contacted Airbnb for a comment."

        "content": "Academics: Dr Ben Richards\n\nPostdoctoral Fellows : Dr Marcus O'Flaherty\n\nStudents: Mr Rory Edwards\n\nThe Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE) is a 26-ton water-based neutrino detector at Fermilab on the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB), small by particle physics standards but with big ambitions. The goal of the effort is to develop a next-generation neutrino detector using advanced photosensors and new experimental techniques, all while making important progress in understanding how neutrinos interact with matter. Measurements of final-state neutron multiplicity from neutrino-nucleus interactions will improve our understanding of the complex, many-body dynamics of neutrino-nucleus interactions and thus help to reduce dominant systematics on future long-baseline neutrino oscillation measurements.\n\nIdentifying and counting final state neutrons also provides a useful experimental handle for signal-background separation in future neutrino experiments. Two enabling technologies make this measurement possible: (1) the first application of Large Area Picosecond Photodetectors (LAPPDs), which will allow detailed timing-based reconstruction of the primary neutrino interaction, and (2) the first use of gadolinium-enhanced water on a high energy neutrino beam to efficiently count final-state neutrons. Phase I of ANNIE, designed to provide a measurement of critical neutron backgrounds, was successfully completed in 2017. Phase II detector for the full physics program of the experiment was installed in July 2019 and currently, it is under commissioning. The collaboration plans to start taking neutrino beam data in December 2019."

        "content": "In a dramatic and unexpected turn of events, BNB Chain, formerly known as Binance Smart Chain, has witnessed a staggering departure of funds from its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. As the crypto world grapples with mounting global regulatory scrutiny aimed at centralized crypto finance (CeFi) service providers, close to $2 billion worth of cryptocurrencies have flowed out of the platform this year alone. This significant shift has left industry observers pondering the implications for BNB Chain\u2019s sustainability and the broader crypto industry.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of DeFi on BNB Chain\n\nDecentralized finance, or DeFi, has been hailed as a revolutionary movement within the world of cryptocurrencies. Its primary goal is to create a more inclusive and open financial system by eliminating intermediaries and facilitating peer-to-peer transactions. BNB Chain, an offshoot of the renowned cryptocurrency exchange Binance, was once a thriving epicenter for DeFi projects. However, recent developments have cast a shadow over its prospects.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with DeFi, it represents a paradigm shift in the financial sector, where traditional financial intermediaries are replaced by smart contracts and blockchain technology. Users can access a wide array of financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, without relying on banks or other traditional financial institutions. This disruptive innovation has garnered immense attention and investment within the crypto space.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s DeFi ecosystem was a shining example of this disruptive force. It attracted a plethora of projects, users, and developers who sought to harness the power of blockchain to create a decentralized financial infrastructure. Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, had thrown its considerable weight behind the BNB Chain, which further bolstered its appeal.\n\nRegulatory Storm Clouds Gather\n\nHowever, the crypto landscape has not been without its challenges. In recent times, the industry has faced increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Concerns over money laundering, fraud, and investor protection have led governments and financial watchdogs to take a closer look at cryptocurrencies and their associated services.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s woes are intrinsically tied to this global regulatory crackdown. As governments seek to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms, many investors and projects have grown wary. The recent outflow of funds from BNB Chain can be seen as a response to these concerns.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Binance, the parent company of BNB Chain, has faced regulatory heat in various jurisdictions. Authorities in several countries, including the United States, have raised questions about Binance\u2019s compliance with local laws. This has created uncertainty among BNB Chain users, prompting some to reconsider their involvement in the ecosystem.\n\nThe $2 Billion Exodus\n\nThe exodus of funds from BNB Chain has raised eyebrows across the crypto industry. In the span of just one year, nearly $2 billion worth of cryptocurrencies have left the platform. This sizable shift in assets is not only a blow to BNB Chain but also a stark reminder of the volatility and unpredictability of the crypto market.\n\nThe reasons behind this mass departure are multifaceted. First and foremost, the regulatory environment has become increasingly unpredictable, leading many participants to seek safer havens for their crypto assets. Additionally, concerns about the sustainability and security of DeFi projects on BNB Chain have played a role. Smart contract vulnerabilities, hacks, and rug pulls have plagued the ecosystem, eroding confidence in its long-term viability.\n\nFurthermore, the very essence of DeFi\u2019s ethos\u2014a trustless and decentralized financial system\u2014has been called into question as centralized exchanges like Binance continue to exert influence and control over their affiliated chains. Some argue that this defeats the purpose of DeFi and undermines its core principles.\n\nImplications for the Crypto Industry\n\nThe departure of funds from BNB Chain carries significant implications for the broader crypto industry. It underscores the delicate balance that DeFi projects must strike between decentralization and regulatory compliance. While DeFi aims to empower users and create a more equitable financial system, it cannot operate in a vacuum, immune to the laws and regulations that govern traditional finance.\n\nMoreover, the BNB Chain case highlights the importance of security and transparency within the DeFi space. Investors and users are becoming increasingly discerning, demanding greater scrutiny of smart contracts, project audits, and transparent governance mechanisms. To thrive in this evolving landscape, DeFi platforms must prioritize these aspects to regain trust and confidence.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThe substantial outflow of funds from BNB Chain serves as a cautionary tale for the crypto industry. It demonstrates the vulnerability of even well-established DeFi ecosystems in the face of regulatory pressures and security concerns. As the crypto world grapples with evolving challenges, it is crucial for participants to adapt, innovate, and find sustainable solutions that can navigate the complex regulatory landscape while staying true to the principles of decentralization.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s future remains uncertain, and its fate will be closely watched by industry insiders and enthusiasts alike. Regardless of the outcome, the lessons learned from this episode will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of DeFi and the broader cryptocurrency industry for years to come."
