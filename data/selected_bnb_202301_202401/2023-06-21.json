This convergence adds an exciting dimension to the investment landscape, with APYs adjusting based on the demand for each pool.\n\nThe ecosystem offers four staking options, each with different earning potential. Users can stake SEC:FOUR-BNB to earn SEC or FOUR, stake FOUR to earn SEC, or stake SEC to earn FOUR.\n\nThe Showdown Phase\n\nOn June 22nd, the real battle starts and it\u2019s time for the user to choose their side and stake their tokens! Two new pools will be set up (stake SEC, earn SEC, stake FOUR, earn FOUR), and to discourage frequent pool switching, these pools have a 1% deposit fee and a 2% withdrawal fee, and withdrawals are locked 2 hours before the countdown ends.
