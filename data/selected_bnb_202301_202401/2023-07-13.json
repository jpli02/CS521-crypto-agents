        "content": "\"The Court has found Ripple to be in violation of securities laws, specifically in relation to direct sales to institutional investors. As such, XRP is not only deemed a security, but questions have arisen regarding the legality of its offering. In regards to these sales, the Court has confirmed that the law was indeed violated, marking a considerable victory for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and setting a precedent for its legal actions against other cryptocurrencies,\" Langsing said in an email."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist is bullish on two popular altcoins amid relatively calm price action for the markets.\n\nStarting with Binance Coin (BNB), the pseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 593,300 Twitters followers that the native token of the Binance Smart Chain is a bargain at a price of below $250.\n\nAccording to Kaleo\u2019s charts, BNB could revisit the $300 price level and potentially hit the April high of slightly above $340 sometime in the last four months of 2023.\n\n\u201cBNB back to $300\n\nBut you wouldn\u2019t \u2018bullieve\u2019 it.\u201d\n\nBNB is trading at $248 at time of writing.\n\nThe pseudonymous crypto strategist says that Binance is currently receiving little attention but that will change once it surges.\n\n\u201cThe funny thing is \u2013 no one is talking about BNB right now \u2013 but, when it finally does take off here in a bit it\u2019s big enough that EVERYONE will be.\n\nAnd everyone will talk about how obvious it was in hindsight.\n\nBut\u2026 somehow it isn\u2019t obvious now.\u201d\n\nNext up is Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Kaleo says that when paired against Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash possesses more upside potential.\n\n\u201cAfter sitting on the sidelines for a few days, I punted another BCH long.\n\nReally like the way it\u2019s looking vs. BTC here for the potential of seeing one last leg higher.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Cash is trading for 0.00926000 BTC ($218.19) at time of writing.

        "content": "On July 12, BNB Chain announced that the mainnet blockchain is expected to have a scheduled hard fork upgrade at block height 328,088,888.\n\nConsidering the current speed of block generation, the hard fork is forecast to occur on July 19, it added. BNB Chain was formerly known as Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nThe hard fork has been dubbed Zhang Heng after a Chinese polymathic scientist and statesman who lived during the Han dynasty.\n\nImportant information about our latest upgrade \u2935\ufe0fhttps://t.co/4sJkTJbGeZ \u2014 BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) July 12, 2023\n\nBNB Chain Security Improvements\n\nThe upgrade will introduce BEP-255, which proposes \u201cimplementing on-chain asset reconciliation on BNB Beacon Chain to improve security.\u201d\n\nIt explained that \u201cuser balance changes are tracked in each block and will be reconciled to identify issues\u201d before adding:\n\n\u201cWhen there are reconciliation errors, the blockchain will panic and stop producing new blocks.\u201d\n\nThere is also a bug fix for a security issue called \u201cRogue Key Attack,\u201d it noted.\n\nThe team explained that no action needs to be taken by BNB holders, but full node operators need to switch to v0.10.16.\n\nLast month BNB Chain went through another hard fork called Luban which introduced three evolution proposals (BEPs).\n\nAccording to DeFiLlama, BNB Chain is the third largest in terms of total value locked with $3.3 billion. There are 626 protocols running on the network, which has around 1.38 million active users, it added.\n\nHowever, BNB Chain TVL has declined by almost 30% since the beginning of this year. Additionally, it is down 85% from its all-time high of $22 billion in May 2021.\n\nThe largest protocol on the network is the PancakeSwap DEX which has almost half of the total value locked.\n\nBNB Price Outlook\n\nBNB prices are down 2.3% on the day to trade at $243 at the time of writing. The asset surged 6% on July 10 as users loaded up on BNB to partake in the Arkham token sale, which begins on Binance Launchpad on July 17.\n\nHowever, BNB has lost 21% since the SEC sued Binance in early June. The exchange token, which the regulator alleges is a security, is also down 64.5% from its May 2021 all-time high of $686."

        "content": "Amid the ongoing consolidation of the majority of the cryptocurrency market, XRP is recording increased daily trading activity, pushing the cryptocurrency toward the very top of the list of the most traded crypto assets, even overtaking some with a higher market capitalization.\n\nSpecifically, crypto traders and investors have transferred 1,489,500,834 XRP tokens worth around $729 million in the last 24 hours, indicating an increase of over 15%, according to the latest information retrieved by Finbold from the crypto monitoring platform CoinMarketCap on July 13.\n\nTop cryptocurrencies by market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nNotably, the daily amount of traded XRP is higher than that of Binance Coin (BNB), which is a larger cryptocurrency than XRP by market capitalization but has recorded a volume of $449 million worth of BNB (1,825,919 BNB) transacted across crypto exchanges during the same time.\n\nWhat it means\n\nAll things considered, the trading volume of a crypto asset does not directly influence its price but rather refers to the activity of traders in buying and selling it. For instance, in the case of XRP, it could indicate whales are selling it as the cryptocurrency continues to trade sideways.\n\nOn the other hand, its price remaining above the critical $0.47 level might suggest that whales are in the \u2018hodl\u2019 mode, taking the chance to accumulate more XRP before its price rallies again \u2013 considering its 4-hour relative strength index (RSI) has risen above 50, according to the data from the finance and crypto analytics platform TradingView.\n\nXRP relative strength index versus price. Source: TradingView\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, XRP was at press time changing hands at the price of $0.4733, recording a decline of 0.12% on the day and dropping 0.24% across the previous week, as well as losing 12.07% to its value in the last month, as the latest charts indicate.\n\nXRP 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIndeed, XRP could improve its price in connection with the developments surrounding the lawsuit that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed against blockchain company Ripple, the outcome of which could set the course for both XRP and the rest of the industry.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
