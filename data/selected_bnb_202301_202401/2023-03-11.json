        "content": "The company that owns the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Yuga Labs, has released new details about the second test of its gamified Otherside metaverse platform.\n\nThe company says that the \u201csecond trip\u201d will happen on March 25 and will be a two-hour story told by four team captains from Otherside. People who own Otherdeed non-fungible tokens (NFTs), tied to real estate in the unreleased Otherside metaverse can go on the second trip. Each owner, called a \u201cvoyager,\u201d can invite a friend to join them.\n\nThe company says the live experience can fit up to 10,000 people based on a first-come, first-served basis. On the company\u2019s YouTube channel, non-holders can also view a live stream of the event.\n\nIn July 2022, Yuga Labs held its \u201cfirst trip,\u201d and more than 4,600 people went. This caused a lot of traffic on the Ethereum network. Participants of the second voyage who also participated in the first voyage will be eligible to obtain a unique Obelisk Piece tied to the overarching Otherside narrative.\n\nWe came, we saw, we made fart noises. Here, a look back at our unforgettable inaugural First Trip together. 4,620 players, 2,560 live-stream views, and Koda booty for DAYS. Can\u2019t wait for the next one. pic.twitter.com/t3un1xmorZ \u2014 Othersidemeta (@OthersideMeta) August 4, 2022\n\nAccording to Wylie Aronow and Greg Solano, who helped start Yuga Labs, \u201cThe Otherside\u201d is where all the company\u2019s projects come together. In April 2022, the company first hinted that it wanted to make a metaverse where users could own land and turn their NFTs into playable characters. At first, Yuga Labs sold 55,000 Otherdeed NFTs tied to virtual land ownership. This brought in about $330 million.\n\nAccording to OpenSea, Otherdeed NFTs have sold 524,130 ETH (approximately $806 million). At the time of publication, the floor price for an Otherdeed NFT is 1.9 ETH, or roughly $2,920."
