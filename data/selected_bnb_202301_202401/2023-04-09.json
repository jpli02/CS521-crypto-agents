        "content": "BNB\n\nThe zkBNB NFT Marketplace aims to bridge the gap between Web2 scale and Web3 monetisation, unlocking true ownership for the next billion gamers.\n\nBNB Chain's Layer 2 Scaling Solution\n\nBNB Chain has launched the zkBNB NFT Marketplace on BNB Chain's Layer 2 scaling solution.\n\nThe marketplace aims to bridge the gap between Web2 scale and Web3 monetisation, unlocking true ownership for the next billion gamers. The zkBNB marketplace allows users to create collections, buy and sell NFTs, make offers, and create their own marketplace using the API.\n\nWith a one million-strong gaming community, NFT transactions are a popular use case among BNB Chain users. Moreover, the similarities between BNB Chain's and Ethereum's EVM should enable Ethereum zkEVM development teams to efficiently port their scaling solution to BNB Chain.\n\nThe move marks an important development in BNB Chain's progress.\n\nSince its launch in September, zkBNB Testnet has garnered a lot of attention, with over ten projects exploring to deploy on it to increase scalability and improve dApp performance. With a whopping 5,000 TPS, it's paving the way for a smoother user experience and lower fees.\n\nNFT-based games revolutionise the approach of the gaming industry, as the decentralised nature of the blockchain ensures no single entity controls the ownership or trade of in-game items, which greatly appeals to gamers. Web3-based games offer more than just unique ownership. Players can earn in-game currency through various activities, creating a deeper connection between the players and the game, enhancing the immersive experience.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to merge the scale of Web2 with the incentive alignment capabilities of Web3, granting the next billion gamers true ownership of their in-game assets. With the introduction of the zkBNB NFT Marketplace, BNB Chain is taking a step forward towards this goal.\n\nWhat is BNB Chain:\n\nPreviously known as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BNB Chain is a community-driven, decentralized, and censorship-resistant blockchain that is powered by Binance. It consists of BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain, EVM compatible and facilitating a multi-chain ecosystem. Through the concept of MetaFI, BNB Chain aims to build the infrastructure to power the world\u2019s parallel virtual ecosystem.\n\nFind more about BNB Chain here:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Discord | Telegram | GitHub |"

Kinda sucks.\"\n\nFANS MISS FRANK\n\nAnother demanded: \"Bring back Frank. We miss him.\"\n\nAnd Mike has agreed with fans - he recently said in an Instagram video: Nothing will ever replace Frank. We miss him very much like y\u2019all do.\"\n\nDanielle, meanwhile, has been showing off her body while she has been slowly recovering from a hysterectomy in October 2022 after suffering from painful uterine fibroids.\n\nDuring her difficult road to recovery, she spent about 14 days unable to eat solid food and confessed to feeling \"exhausted and down.\"\n\nFRANK'S BACK?\n\nMike even recently gave hope that fan-favorite star Frank could return to the show.\n\nWhile visiting Washington, DC, in December, Mike was asked by Capital Paparazzi if he would be willing to make amends with Frank.\n\nHe revealed: \u201cFrank and I are friends, he was just at my brother\u2019s graduation for his kids right before he got his stroke.\n\n\u201cIf anybody\u2019s thinking about Frank, they should be praying for him.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he would ever make a return to the popular History series, Mike shared: \u201cI would hope that he\u2019s gonna be back on the show, but right now he needs to get healthier.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely hope - 100 percent.\u201d\n\nHe laughed off his rumored rift with Frank, saying \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely not true.\u201d\n\n5 The new guesthouse will seemingly be an added income for Mike Credit: Instagram"

Harry and I are both entrepreneurs and so we just decided to differ into this interesting market\n\n\"Harry has a background in boating and as Manchester's got a lot of heritage with canals, we decided that a canal boat would tie in with the whole idea.\n\n\"I personally had no experience with any rentals before, so it started off on a bit of a whim as a fun side business for us.\"\n\nThe pair designed the wide beam canal boat from scratch with help from interior designer Claudia Chez to give it the utmost luxury feel.\n\nAccommodating up to six people, the canal boat has a range of guests from couples enjoying a romantic break to hen dos and birthday parties.\n\nErin continued: \"We went for the largest size at 70 foot, that's the biggest size you can physically put on the water.\n\n\"We went to look at lots of boats that people lived on and and then we started adapting things to make it the best version of a narrow boat that we could.\n\n\"It's a kind of modern take on a traditional boat and I would say we completely turned what a canal boat is meant to be on its head.\"\n\nThe whole process from designing it to completion took almost nine months and the total cost was around \u00a3220,000.\n\nAnd their popular staycation spot is now been valued at around \u00a3300,000.\n\nThere are some incredible hotels in Manchester but we stand out because we\u2019re that bit different.\" Erin Short, 28\n\n\"We spent three months negotiating and getting all of the design elements together and then we started with the build, which took probably six months to get right,\" Erin added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got around \u00a33,000 worth of flowers on the boat, the kitchen top cost around \u00a35,000, the beds are almost \u00a31,000 each and the linen is around \u00a31,000, so everything we kitted the boat out with was expensive and done to a high standard.\n\n\"When I think of how it went from building the shell to what it is now, it\u2019s amazing.\"\n\nThe boat boasts two luxury king-sized bedrooms and a spacious open plan kitchen, living and a VIP outdoor area.\n\nGiving a tour around the boat, Erin described: \"We find that guests expect it to be a lot smaller than it is, but it\u2019s huge.\n\n\u201cWhen you first step onto the boat you have the outdoor deck with some seating which is lovely for drinking cocktails in the summer or hot chocolates in the winter.\n\n\"When you go down into the boat you\u2019ve got a living kitchen area which has a large pull-out sofa bed and a smart TV. Then we have a big kitchen island which is great for socialising and celebrating.\n\nErin added: \"You really do forget that you are on a boat when you\u2019re on it.

        "title": "Who Cares For The Caregivers? The Iris Respite House In Moon Now Offers Them Self Care - Pittsburgh Magazine",
        "content": "Annie Ross of Monroeville has been the sole caregiver for her husband, Joe, for the past six years.\n\nWatching her high school sweetheart and best friend change before her eyes by a form of dementia has taken its toll. He has behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration, which changes a person\u2019s behaviors and leads to apathy and a progressive decline in socially appropriate behavior, judgment, self-control and empathy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heart-wrenching,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was the most gentle, kind, giving, loving and humble man. He was raised to take care of his family. Now, he can\u2019t do that for me anymore. I can see how it crushes him, how it guilts him to see me struggling to do what we used to do together to maintain everything. After all that, I\u2019m just too tired to take care of myself.\u201d\n\n\n\nRoss, 63, has sought solace in Hope Grows, a Moon nonprofit started by Lisa Story 12 years ago to provide counseling and phone and virtual support to caregivers.\n\nIn the nonprofit\u2019s latest project, Lisa and her husband, Charles, recently opened their home and healing gardens at 183 Shafer Road to start the Iris Respite House bed and breakfast to give caregivers a much-needed break.\n\nIt\u2019s the first of its kind in the region, and possibly the country, says Dr. David Nace, chief medical officer, UPMC Senior Communities and assistant professor of medicine, University of Pittsburgh Division of Geriatric Medicine.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a need that\u2019s unmet,\u201d he says. \u201cCaregivers might not have the income they had previously or have diverted funds, so taking a vacation may not be possible. This is a chance for them to step out, get out of the environment they were in and give their mind a break from the stressors to allow their creativity to come back.\u201d\n\nRoss agrees.\n\n\u201cI could go to a spa or hotel, but it won\u2019t be the same,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the same as being with people of a like mind. It also gives me more juice so I can be there for him.\u201d\n\nRoots of Support\n\nLisa, a certified horticultural therapist, licensed professional counselor and certified thanatologist with experience working in hospice and grief, started her nonprofit after experiencing her own life challenges.\n\n\u201cWhen my father passed away in 2005, I had never really grieved the death of my mother, who died 20 years prior,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I was grieving them both at the same time. I was looking to heal, so I retreated to nature. That\u2019s when I was starting to heal.\u201d\n\nCreating the beautiful gardens around her home, each with a different theme, were the result of her healing process.\n\nOnce she developed the mission for Hope Grows she began researching what was lacking in the Pittsburgh region in the healing process. She discovered that caregiver support is not common in the area. She also notes 1 in 5 Americans is an unpaid family caregiver. Hope Grows now serves 1,300 caregivers in nine states.\n\nThe idea for the respite house bed and breakfast was planted in 2011.\n\n\u201cI went to my husband and said, \u2018What do you think about turning this place into an overnight bed and breakfast for caregivers?\u2019 He said, \u2018Have you lost your mind!?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cHe eventually came around, and I couldn\u2019t do any of this without him.\u201d\n\nThey waited until their children were grown and had left the house, then learned their property was already zoned for a bed and breakfast.\n\nThe Storys received the greenlight from Moon officials to renovate their home and opened in March. The blue-bearded iris is the theme of the b&b because it is the flower that represents caregiving.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to inspire hope through nature while empowering caregivers to seek wellness of mind, body and spirit,\u201d Lisa says.\n\nWhat it Offers\n\nThe Iris Respite House currently has two bedrooms, each with a private bathroom, ready for caregivers to rent for a night or two. The house will eventually have four bedrooms when renovations are complete. The Storys plan to build a smaller home on their property so the b&b can be its own entity, run by a house manager.\n\nThe b&b also has a chef and their horticulturist, Jessica Giannotta, tends the gardens.\n\n\n\nA room at Iris House costs $150 a night. Family Hospice, a 42-year-old organization that is now part of UPMC, has applied for a grant to help offset the cost for caregivers staying in the b&b.\n\nThe house offers breakfast, the eight healing and restorative gardens \u2014 The Garden of Hope, The Garden of the Inner Child, The Garden of Harmony and Peace, The Pollinator Garden, The Garden of Faith, Pap\u2019s Garden, The Garden of Intent and The Garden of Rest \u2014 a trail on 2.5 acres and access to mental and emotional counseling from a clinical team of mental health professionals.\n\nOther features include a large enclosed sun porch, an indoor pool, the skylight-flanked living room and kitchen. The Storys also are hoping to add spa and salon facilities downstairs so guests can schedule a massage or get a haircut. Future plans also include a labyrinth, pond, chapel area and forest garden.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for them to get to the store, let alone get a haircut. It\u2019s an opportunity to give them a break,\u201d Lisa says about caregivers. \u201cWe will also offer weekly activities, integrative therapies and more. It will basically be a retreat that\u2019s geared toward caregiving.\u201d\n\nLisa notes it is tough for caregivers to let go of guilt long enough to understand the crucial need for self care.\n\n\u201cPart of what we work on is guilt, loss and regret. We strive to do this through a positive, mindful, holistic approach. It\u2019s important for you to take care of yourself.\u201d\n\nRoss refers to Hope Grows as her \u201csafe space\u201d and touts its support groups.\n\n\u201cIt brings me such deep joy to know that we can be ourselves and not have to explain, explain, explain,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople who aren\u2019t caregivers just don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s so nice that I can go there and be myself; the energy that we carry in that moment is ours.\u201d\n\nNeed Continues to Grow\n\nNace of UPMC says the Iris Respite House comes at a time when it\u2019s most needed.\n\n\u201cWe have a shortage of caregivers and health care workers,\u201d he explains. \u201cBaby boomers are retiring and that workforce is shrinking. We knew this was a crisis before the pandemic, and since the pandemic, it\u2019s blown up. We need to preserve the population of caregivers we have.\u201d\n\nLisa says Hope Grows has grown exponentially since the pandemic began in 2020. She expects operations at the b&b to cost around $250,000 a year, with a portion offset by donations.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with helping caregivers is that the issue does not tug at the heartstrings of the general public,\u201d says Lisa. \u201cPeople ask why insurance can\u2019t pay for it, or they wonder what a tired caregiver is.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand it if you aren\u2019t in it. Our biggest contributors are those who have gone through it.\u201d"

        "title": "ETH vs Alts: Which is better?. Alt-coin gambling is a $379B market\u2026 | by Tin Money - DataDrivenInvestor",
        "content": "ETH vs Alts: Which is better? Tin Money \u00b7 Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor \u00b7 7 min read \u00b7 Apr 9, 2023 -- 2 Listen Share\n\nAlt-coin gambling is a $379B market. Question being: Is it worth it?\n\nImage: ImgFlip\n\nAlt-coin moon units\n\nAs I\u2019ve said in the past, for the vast majority of people that want to invest in digital assets, their best bet is Bitcoin.\n\nThe reason being, in dollar terms, alt-coins can outperform BTC on short time horizons. But expand the time out a bit, and it is almost always better to hold BTC.\n\nThe one odd exception (at least among the majors) has been BNB. I used to be a fan of the token for that very reason.\n\nHave a look:\n\nImage: TradingView\n\nThat is the BNB (Binance) chart, priced in BTC. The orange line is BTC/USDT and the teal line is BNB/USDT.\n\nAs you can see, from early 2021 until late 2022, BNB appreciated rapidly in BTC terms. It\u2019s since fallen off a bit, but that\u2019s unsurprising given the scrutiny Binance has been receiving lately.\n\nI\u2019ve since abandoned BNB as an investment. There was an article floating around that suggested BNB price was being manipulated via under-collateralised BUSD.\n\nWhether it\u2019s true or not is irrelevant.\n\nThe fact that it might be true is enough for me to steer clear. There\u2019s plenty of shitecoins out there to speculate on. I certainly don\u2019t need to be wrapped up in a narrative that might go sour.\n\nNot to mention this:\n\nImage: TradingView\n\nThat is BNB priced in ETH. Teal is BNB/USDT, red is ETH/USDT. Notice anything strange?\n\nLike how closely correlated BNB price action (in USDT) is to ETH? That does not look like natural market movement.\n\nThat looks intentional, which means manipulated.\n\nIs it evidence? Nope. Does it strengthen the notion that something is rotten in BNB-land?\n\nIt does for me.\n\nAlt-coin gambling\n\nEnough about BNB though.\n\nThe real question we\u2019re going to answer here is: Will your [fill-in-the-blank] shitecoin outperform ETH?\n\nOr, would it have been better to just buy ETH in the first place? Did you guess the answer? It\u2019s ETH.\n\n100%.\n\nJust look at the charts. I picked these coins because they have sufficient history to be relevant. Things like Aptos haven\u2019t been around long enough to determine price performance.\n\nWhat these charts DO show is shitecoins might outperform ETH for a short time. But, sooner or later, the rocket comes back to earth, and the shitecoin will bleed.\n\nMeaning, you would have been better off just buying ETH.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look. The blue line on all charts is ETH/USDT. Prices are in ETH.\n\nAAVE/ETH\n\nImage: TradingView\n\nAs you can see, this chart is just like I said earlier. AAVE had a brief couple of months in early 2021 where it outperformed ETH. Meaning, AAVE got more expensive in ETH terms.\n\nBut, then AAVE slowly bleeds against ETH until today. Meaning, AAVE gets cheaper and cheaper in ETH terms.\n\nOr, in other words, you would have been better off buying and holding ETH. If you\u2019re clever, you buy AAVE with ETH when it\u2019s cheap and sell AAVE for ETH when it\u2019s expensive.\n\nThus, you stack more ETH. Make sense?\n\nI\u2019ll warn you now, it\u2019s easier said than done. Which takes me back to my first point \u2014 for most people, they should probably just stick with ETH.\n\nDOT/ETH\n\nImage: TradingView\n\nDo you know the music they used to play in old sitcoms like I Love Lucy. They\u2019d play it when something went wrong.\n\nWah-Waah.\n\nIf this chart could make a sound, that\u2019s the one it would make. If you bought the absolute pico-bottom of when the ETH/DOT pair launched on Binance and then sold the absolute pico-top the same day, you did great!\n\nOtherwise, you should have just bought ETH.\n\nGMX/ETH\n\nImage: TradingView\n\nNow, here\u2019s a chart worth paying attention to. I had no idea what GMX was. The first I heard about it was on CryptoBanter.\n\nI didn\u2019t do any research. I poked around on the GMX dashboard a little bit, but that was it.\n\nI just aped-in really.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t much money and it took a second to figure out how to bridge to Arbitrum. A couple nice things have come from this:\n\nI received the ARB airdrop; I\u2019m earning legit yield in ETH on a token that is appreciating steadily against ETH.\n\nThat\u2019s a double-rainbow my friends! The tokenomics for GMX are actually pretty good. It\u2019s a gamble that seems to be paying off for me so far.\n\nI\u2019m NOT recommending it. I\u2019m pointing out that there are some tokens that can outperform ETH, but it\u2019s RARE.\n\nOr, at least, it has been rare in the past. Maybe crypto is finally growing up?\n\nLINK/ETH\n\nImage: TradingView\n\nSpeaking of outperforming ETH, this chart is what I\u2019m afraid GMX/ETH will eventually end up looking like.\n\nAs you can see, on a long enough time horizon, ETH tends to outperform ALTs. And, LINK is a great example. For over two-years, LINK bigly outperformed ETH.\n\nBut, sure enough, given enough time, the bleed began and hasn\u2019t stopped since. If you had been clever enough to swing into LINK early and swing out in 2021, you could have really stacked a lot of ETH doing so.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t quite that clever, you just round tripped and probably should have bought ETH to begin with.\n\nSeeing a pattern here?\n\nSOL/ETH\n\nImage: TradingView\n\nHere\u2019s a chart for the venture capital hype-driven dumpster fire that is Solana. ETH killer?\n\nOkay buddy.\n\nIf by \u201cETH killer\u201d, you mean down only bleed-out into oblivion, then sure. Make no mistake, for the venture capitalists that bought Solana for pennies and then dumped on your head, they did GREAT.\n\nFor all the folks that bought the 2021 top, they got REKT. Bad. Narratives sell tokens. If you\u2019re not part of CREATING the narrative, you\u2019re probably someone\u2019s exit liquidity.\n\nOr, you could just buy ETH.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe boring truth about crypto is, for the overwhelming majority of retail investors, there are really only two projects worth looking at:\n\nBitcoin; and Ethereum.\n\nIf you are collecting shitecoins during the project\u2019s fund-raise or presale, then ALTs make a lot of sense. If you\u2019re buying retail, you\u2019re buying a narrative designed to entice YOU.\n\nYou can capitalise on that, but it\u2019s tricky. Even for someone like me that has the weird combination of a tech and finance background, I\u2019m probably going to be wrong more than I am right.\n\nNot to mention, one of the best performing ALTs I have in my bags right now, I had never heard of until seeing it on a show. I just blindly aped and got lucky.\n\nMy ultimate goal in crypto is to stack BTC. I don\u2019t like ETH and I don\u2019t hold it.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of ALT projects I do speculate on, why I do, and the allocation.\n\nAxelar \u2014 AXL: Cross-chain protocol; \u201clikely\u201d strong narrative in next cycle; tokenomics suck, BUT was available just above presale price; 2.5% (future) allocation, closed long in profit in February. Planet Finance \u2014 AQUA: fair launch; investor friendly tokenomics, but they\u2019re struggling against \u201creal\u201d yield protocols like GMX; 2.5% allocation. Constellation \u2014 DAG: legit potential game-changing tech stack; token is right around presale prices from 2018; 5% allocation. FraxFinance \u2014 FXS: fair launch; next-level innovation and devs; yield generating; 10% allocation. GMX \u2014 GMX/GLP: good tokenomics (for the GMX token); real yield paid in ETH; 10% allocation. Fantom \u2014 FTM: I use the protocol more than all others combined; solid and evolving tech; inexpensive; long dev runway; 10% allocation. NEAR Protocol \u2014 NEAR: legit tech; easy dev on-board; simplified UX; bought at roughly 3x launch price; 2.5% allocation. Stargate \u2014 STG: Same as AXL basically; 2.5% allocation.\n\nAnd, that\u2019s it. Roughly 45% of my crypto budget is in those ALTs. The rest is dedicated to big daddy BTC.\n\nTo be clear, I am NOT recommending you buy ANY of these. The overwhelming likelihood is that I\u2019m wrong about some, if not all of them, and their potential to outperform BTC or ETH.\n\nIt\u2019s just something to give you a little food for thought before you ape into whatever shitecoin narrative you might be considering.\n\nBut, if someone in real life asks me about getting into crypto, my answer is always:\n\n\u201cJust buy BTC and don\u2019t worry about that other crap.\u201d\n\nThese are just my opinions. I\u2019m not a financial advisor, this isn\u2019t financial advice, and always DYOR. Following any of these ideas might cause you to lose all of your money. I am 100% serious about that. I like tinkering with this stuff, but I\u2019m on record acting like a total baboon. Invest accordingly.\n\nUntil next time, be safe, be smart and be sure to tie the camel."
