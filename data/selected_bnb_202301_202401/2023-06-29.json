        "title": "PEPE token will be launched on the BNB Chain - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "PRESS RELEASE*\n\nA new PEPE memecoin is launching, following hot on the heels of its Ethereum namesake. Issued as a BEP20 on BNB Chain, PEPE is a novel memecoin with a number of unique mechanisms programmed into its tokenomics.\n\nLike the original PEPE token, which has proven a runaway success in 2023, the BEP20 PEPE draws its cues from the mischievous frog of the same name, whose design was derived from the webcomic \u201cBoy\u2019s Club.\u201d\n\nThe market capitalization of the original PEPE token, which debuted on Ethereum in April, exceeded $1 billion on May 5th, prompting a new wave of memecoins, including a number of frog-themed efforts. Unlike subsequent memecoins, the PEPE (BEP20) has several unusual features programmed in including a syndication system designed to support price stabilization.\n\nThe team behind the BNB Chain PEPE aren\u2019t settling for just one memecoin either: they plan to launch multiple PEPE projects, all based on the loveable frog. 13 such launches have been cued up for 2023 alone.\n\nAlthough each PEPE project will operate independently, the introduction of a \u201cBurn & Drop\u201d system will govern the consortium. Burn & Drop is a first-of-its-kind system in which burning one token leads to the airdrop of another.\n\nTo initiate a Burn & Drop, two types of tokens are required. For example, this could involve a scenario in which Token A is priced at $1 and PEPE (BEP20) is also priced at $1. However, if the price of Token A were to drop to $0.8, Token A holders would have the option to burn their tokens on the Burn & Drop platform, automatically receiving PEPE (BEP20) through an airdrop, and with Token A having been burned, its total supply would decrease.\n\nBy initiating the Burn & Drop process between tokens, excess volatility can be reduced while possibly providing trading opportunities for arbitrage and intra-token trading. This logic is a fundamental component of PEPE (BEP20), and one which users can engage with directly within the platform.\n\nIn addition, PEPE (BEP20) has plans to introduce numerous services that will further extend the token\u2019s utility. To further increase interest in the project, PEPE (BEP20) is currently running an airdrop campaign on Twitter that\u2019s open to everyone.\n\nAbout PEPEBEP20\n\nPEPE is a project launched on the Binance Smart Chain, taking the form of a BEP20 token. The Pepe Syndicate and the unique \u201cBurn&Drop\u201d mechanism of Pepe are designed to manage the token\u2019s price volatility. This is not a guarantee of price stability, but a mechanism to potentially mitigate price fluctuations. Furthermore, various projects that participate in the \u201cBurn&Drop\u201d system collaborate with each other, fostering a robust Pepe Syndicate network.\n\nFor more information regarding the campaign, please visit\n\nPEPE BEP20\u2019s Twitter (@pepecoinbep20),\n\nJoin PEPE BEP20\u2019s Telegram,\n\nWebsite: https://pepe.markets/"

        "title": "opBNB Explained: What is opBNB \u2013 The New Layer-2 By Binance And Why Does It Matter? - Blockmanity",
        "content": "OpBNB is a new layer-2 solution for the BNB Chain (BSC chain) based on Optimism Rollups. It was announced on June 19, to solve the growing network congestion problem on the main BNB Chain .\n\nWhat is opBNB?\n\nopBNB is a solution for the growing congestion issues on the BNB Chain. It is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer-2 solution based on Optimism Rollups Stack and optimized to enhance the scalability on the BNB Chain while maintaining security and preserving low transaction fees.\n\nOptimism-based Rollups had been proposed to go live on the BNB Chain as a way to reduce the computational load on the chain via the execution of transactions off-chain and only posting the transaction data on-chain as call data. This solution would drastically improve the scalability of the network by bundling multiple transactions together before their submission to the main chain, which reduces the memory space used.\n\nThe introduction of opBNB to BNB Chain will bring new features, thus making the chain more efficient. These features and new abilities include making data access easier, improving the cache system of the network, and adjusting the submission process algorithm to allow simultaneous operations (also known as batcher).\n\nAdjusting the submission process algorithm to support simultaneous operations allows OpBNB to push the gas limit to 100M, higher than Optimism\u2019s supported 30M. As such, OpBNB will be able to handle over 4000 transactions per second while maintaining an average transaction cost of below $0.005. This integration will improve the existing 2000 transactions per second, making the network double as fast.\n\nopBNB can support over 4000 transfer transactions per second and an average transaction cost lower than 0.005 USD. \u2014 BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) June 19, 2023\n\nWhat are Optimistic rollups?\n\nAn optimistic rollup is an layer-2 scaling solution designed for Ethereum ( or EVM ). It works by moving computation, state storage and execute transactions outside Ethereum but post the data to the mainnet as calldata.\n\nOptimistic rollups also use compression techniques to reduce the data size posted on the layer-1. They are named \u201coptimistic\u201d because they assume off-chain transactions are valid and thus do not need to publish proofs of validity for transaction batches posted on-chain. As such, they are set apart from zero knowledge rollups that publish cryptographic proofs of validity for off-chain transactions. They instead have a time window where anyone can challenge the results of a rollup transaction via computing a fraud-proof. If the fraud-proof succeeds, the roll-up protocol re-executes the transacts and updates the rollup\u2019s state accordingly.\n\nIf the rollup batch stays unchallenged after challenge time ellipses, it is deemed valid and expected. Others are allowed to continue building on an unconfirmed rollup block but with a caveat: transaction results will be reversed if based on an incorrectly executed transaction that has been published previously.\n\nHow will optimistic rollups interact with BNB Chain?\n\nTransaction and aggregation\n\nUsers will submit transactions to \u201coperators\u201d, nodes responsible for processing transactions. They are also known as validators or aggregators. They aggregate transactions, compress underlying data and publish it on opBNB.\n\nUnlike BNB Chain, where anyone can be a validator, optimistic rollup validators for opBNB will have to provide a bond before producing a block, similar to what is in a proof of stake system. In case of bad acting, the bond can be slashed to prevent dishonest acts from validators.\n\nSubmitting roll-up blocks on opBNB\n\nThe operator of an optimistic rollup bundle off-chain transactions into a batch and then send it to opBNB for notarization. This process involves compression of the data and publishing it as calldata.\n\nCalldata is a non-modifiable, non-persistent area in a smart contract that behaves like a memory. Calldata sends compressed transaction data to the on-chain contract, where the rollup operator adds a new batch by calling the required function in the contract and passing compressed data as function arguments. This process reduces user fees as most of the fees spent come from storing data on-chain.\n\nState commitments\n\nThe optimistic rollup\u2019s state (accounts, balances, contract code, etc.) is organized as a Merkle tree called a \u201cstate tree\u201d. The root of this Merkle tree (state route), which references the rollup\u2019s latest state, is then hashed and stored in the contract. Every state transition on the chain produces a new roll-up state that an operator commits to by computing a new state root.\n\nWhen posting batches, the operator must submit old and new state roots. If they match, the new state root is used. The operator must also commit a Merkle root for the transaction batch to allow anyone to prove the inclusion of a transaction in the batch by presenting Merkle proof.\n\nFraud Proving\n\nOptimistic rollups allow anyone to publish blocks without providing proof of validity. However, ensuring the chains are safe allows for a specific time window where anyone can dispute a state transaction (assertion). If someone disputes an assertion, the roll-up protocol initiates the fraud-proof computation, an interactive process requiring someone to post an assertion before another person challenges it.\n\nSingle-round interactive fraud-proof schemes replay disputed transactions on L1 to detect invalid assertions. The roll-up protocol then emulates the re-execution of the disputed transaction on opBNB via a verifier contract with the computed state root showing who won the challenge. The operator is penalized by slashing their bond if the challenger is correct about mistakes.\n\nMulti-round interactive proving\n\nMulti-round interactive proving involves a back-and-forth protocol between the asserter and the challenger overseen by an L1 verifier contract that ultimately decides who lies. After an L2 node challenges an assertion, the asserter divides the disputed assertion into two halves(bisection protocol). Each assertion will contain as many steps as the other.\n\nThe challenger then chooses the assertion that they want to challenge. It continues till both parties are disputing an assertion about a single step of execution. This is when L1 contracts resolve the dispute by evaluating the instruction and its result to catch the fraudulent party.\n\nThe asserter must then provide a \u201cone-step proof\u201d verifying the validity of the disputed single-step computation. If the asserter fails to provide the on-step proof or the L1 verifier contract deems the proof invalid, they lose the challenge.\n\nFeatures of opBNB\n\nEnhanced scalability\n\nopBNB supports over 4000 transactions per second, double the available transaction speed on BNB Chain. This capability gives it a boost clear of BNB Chain current abilities making it ideal for applications that have large daily active users.\n\nEVM compatibility\n\nopBNB presents an accessible platform for developers familiar with Ethereum\u2019s tooling and dApps as it is Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible. That means it will be easier for developers seeking to migrate or introduce extensions of their Ethereum applications to the BNB Chain. That also creates a chance for the developers to take advantage of both Ethereum and BNB Chain ecosystems.\n\nImproved security and trust\n\nWhen it comes to blockchain technology, security and trust are very crucial. opBNB provides a fraud-proving scheme that can be pursued by anyone who notices discrepancies. As such, the transaction(s) in question will be redone, which adds a layer of trust in developers and users alike.\n\nThe improved transparency and verifiability of transactions on opBNB will also encourage a healthier and safer environment for building blockchain ecosystems.\n\nRich ecosystem integration\n\nopBNB was built to make it a part of a broader ecosystem. It is optimized as an integration to the broader BNB Chain ecosystem to provide developers and projects the chance to interact with various other projects and tokens, including but not limited to ERC-20 and its derivative standards.\n\nAs such, opBNB has the potential to foster the growth of a diverse array of blockchain applications ranging from gaming dApps to social networks and Decentralized Finance.\n\nFuture-proof development\n\nBlockchain technology is growing rapidly, necessitating long-lasting solutions to stay competitive. opBNB does just this. It comes with improved security, better efficiency, and compatibility with other projects, making it robust and flexible. As a result, developers can adapt to changes more easily, introduce new features and experiment with new ideas making it a solution that will push BNB Chain forward for many years.\n\nConclusion\n\nBlockchain technology is a revolutionary innovation of our time. It has introduced easier and trustless data communication ways. As a result, it has found a place in sensitive industries like finance and data management. While all is said and done, some problems remain, like the scalability and affordability of networks.\n\nExisting layer 1 networks that allow the building of applications face congestion issues arising from lacking scalability. BNB Chain is easily one such network working to evade the problem by introducing scaling solutions like opBNB. This solution will help the network remain resilient for a longer time.\n\nHowever, nothing is promised regarding the future demands that the network may face. Therefore, do your research on opBNB and use it wisely. Keep watching Blockmanity for updates on the crypto and blockchain industries.\n\nDiscuss this news on our Telegram Community.
