Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBinance users flooded the exchange with over $4 billion to farm the highly-anticipated SUI token launch.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest exchange by trading volume added support for the SUI token through its Launchpad for BNB and TUSD holders on Monday with the event ending on Tuesday.\n\nUsers staked tokens worth over $4 billion to farm SUI tokens. Due to the crowding of the pools, however, an average of one dollar invested in the launchpad only reaped 0.016 SUI.\n\nBinance Launchpad is a bootstrapping portal on the exchange, where the exchange sells or enables liquidity farming of tokens of new cryptocurrency projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSUI is the native gas and governance token of the Move-based Layer-1 blockchain platform, Sui. The project was developed by several former senior executives and architects for Meta\u2019s now-defunct digital wallet program, Novi. Its mainnet is expected to launch today at 8 am ET with the exchange indicating it will open trading shortly after.\n\nBinance will distribute 40 million SUI tokens, with 80% going toward BNB stakers and the rest toward TUSD stakers. The rewards were calculated on an hourly basis, with snapshots of staked balances taken each hour.\n\nThe total amount deposited in the pool officially surpassed $4.02 billion, with $770 million in the TUSD pool and BNB worth $3.2 billion.\n\nBinance isn\u2019t the only exchange that\u2019s partnered to dole out SUI tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKucoin and OKX were also tapped to launch to sell tokens, too, both of which concluded last month. The two platforms raised a total of $45 million via a public sale."

        "content": "WEB3\n\nDevelopers can now access the blockchain's resources and build the next big projects with unique utilities in the industry.\n\nSui Network Goes Live\n\nSui Network has finally announced its highly anticipated mainnet launch, allowing users to interact with its blockchain fully. In addition to the launch, the Layer-1 blockchain protocol\u2019s secure token bridge is now available for users.\n\nSui\u2019s mainnet went live on May 3 at 12:00 UTC, after devnet and multiple testnets. The launch represents a significant milestone for the blockchain protocol, coupled with its innovative token bridge. Now, developers can build on the fast, secure, and accessible blockchain. On the other hand, the bridge would allow users to seamlessly transfer assets between supported chains, including BNB Chain and Ethereum.\n\nFollowing the mainnet launch, the smart contracts platform could power the next generation of GameFi, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and commercial Decentralized Applications (dApps) in the industry. Thus, users can expect numerous protocols which support digital asset ownership, transaction capabilities, and more in the coming weeks and months. Director of Sui Foundation, Greg Siourounis, promised support for developers in the long run.\n\n\u201cI am deeply honored to help the Foundation support developers and proliferate the advancement of technology that is truly accessible and relevant to all facets of life, safe to use, and built by developers for developers,\u201d Greg stated.\n\nSiu\u2019s mainnet launch coincides with its native $SIU token launch on Binance exchange. As of writing, the coin is up over 1500% from its listing price, with huge potential to continue its bullish trend in the crypto market.\n\nWhat is Sui Network:\n\nSui is a layer-1 chain with low latency and high throughput. Sui's instant transaction finality makes it an excellent choice for on-chain use cases like DeFi and GameFi. Rust, a programming language focused on fast and secure transaction execution, creates the blockchain. Solana, another high-speed blockchain, also uses Rust as its programming language.\n\nLearn more about Sui Network:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Discord\n\n\u200d"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSolana, one of the largest \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d, has surpassed the latter to become the network with the most transactions.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nansen shared a tweet comparing April\u2019s most active on-chain addresses. According to the firm, Solana came in second after BNB Chain, becoming the network with the most active address by chain at 5.1 million in April.\n\nAnd despite that figure dropping by around 12% from March, the cryptocurrency network still managed to outdo Ethereum, which had 4.9 million active addresses in April.\n\nSolana also surpassed Ethereum by non-vote transactions last month. Non-vote transactions are transactions that do not involve any voting or decision-making by token holders. They typically involve the transfer of cryptocurrency between wallets or accounts and are the most common type of transaction on most blockchain networks due to their simplicity. According to Nansen data, as of April 30, Solana\u2019s total non-vote transactions stood at 24.3 million compared to Ethereum\u2019s 974,972.\n\nSolana\u2019s attractive growth can be attributed to various factors, including a surge in developers and users due to its attractive transaction speeds and costs. Apart from announcing various developments that go into improving the network, including a Chat GPT plugin and a web3 phone, Solana\u2019s ballooning transactions have also been propelled by NFTs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, Mad Lads, a new project launched on Solana, became the most traded collection generating $17 million compared with $11 million for Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club collection during the last week of April. This is despite the Solana facing a major setback following the exit of y00ts and DeGods, two of its most popular collections, earlier this year.\n\nLaunched roughly a month ago, Mad Lads is a unique type of NFT that falls in a category called xNFTs. Ideally, xNFTs combine the features of traditional NFTs and executable code, meaning users can use them to conduct other activities such as gaming and chatting.\n\nThat said, Solana\u2019s native token SOL has also performed well, soaring by over 116% since January 1. This is compared to Bitcoin, up 70%, and Ether, up just over 50% year-to-date.\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $21.47, down 3.36% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. On the other hand, Ether rose by 1.66% in the same period and was exchanging hands at $1,851."
