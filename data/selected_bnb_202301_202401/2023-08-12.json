        "content": "Airbnb has revolutionised the short-stay industry.\n\nLaunched in 2008, it now eclipses the world's biggest hotel chains.\n\nIn Australia alone there are about 100,000 listed properties.\n\nAirbnb has revolutionised the short-stay industry. (Nine)\n\nBut in dealing with both a digital platform and a private owner (or \"host\", in Airbnb-speak), your legal rights as a renter (or \"guest\") can be unclear \u2013 at least without reading lengthy terms and conditions.\n\nThis article answers six very common questions about using Airbnb in Australia.\n\nPlease note that your legal rights may differ in other countries.\n\nEven if Airbnb's terms and conditions are near identical \u2013 and they generally are \u2013 there may be differences in consumer laws.\n\nWhat if an Airbnb property doesn't match its description?\n\nAirbnb's terms and conditions require the host to provide \"complete and accurate information\" about their property.\n\nContent, including photos, must be \"up-to-date and accurate at all times\".\n\nAirbnb's Host Ground Rules state that listings \"should accurately describe the home and reflect the features and amenities that will be available\".\n\nIf a property does not match its description or photos, report this to Airbnb .\n\nFalse advertising will also likely breach the Australian Consumer Law, which prohibits (Section 18) commercial conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.\n\nReport to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission here .\n\nAirbnb listings must provide \"complete and accurate information\" about the property.\n\nThere are no specific provisions to claim a refund or a discount for misleading listings.\n\nYour only recourse would seem to be to initiate the cancellation policy that applies to your booking.\n\nREAD MORE: Virgin Galactic launches first space tourists flight\n\nSo when can I get a refund?\n\nIf you cancel your booking or leave the property early, your refund rights are determined by your cancellation policy (see \"show trip details\").\n\nThere are various policies (from which a host selects when listing).\n\nMost allow full refunds if you cancel one to five days prior to check-in, while others require up to 30 days' notice or only provide partial refunds.\n\nIf the host cancels on you, they may be penalised by Airbnb.\n\nIf you cancel your booking or leave the property early, your refund rights are determined by your cancellation policy. (LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nCan an Airbnb host impose harsh and unreasonable 'house rules'?\n\nIf an owner wants to make rules against visitors without their permission or how many times you can use the washing machine, they generally can.\n\nWhen you rent a property through Airbnb, you are entering into a private agreement with the owner.\n\nUnder contract law, they can stipulate whatever terms they like, so long as those rules aren't illegal.\n\nA Reddit user posted this list of \"additional rules\" they say they say was stuck on the door of their Airbnb accommodation.\n\nA Reddit user posted this photo of \"additional rules\" they say they say was stuck on the door of their Airbnb accommodation. (Reddit)\n\nWhat Australian Consumer Law does prohibit are unfair terms in standard form \"consumer contracts\" \u2013 which an Airbnb contract likely qualifies as.\n\nAn unfair term is one that:\n\n\u2022 causes a significant imbalance in your rights and obligations\n\n\u2022 is not reasonably necessary to protect the host's interests\n\n\u2022 would cause you detriment (financial or otherwise) if it was enforced.\n\nThe problem is that you will need to sue the host (that is, initiate civil litigation) to prove this.\n\nYour best option is to carefully review the rules before you confirm your reservation.\n\nOnce you confirm, you are legally agreeing to all of the host's terms whether you've read and understood them or not.\n\nIf you disagree with a rule, ask the host to waive or amend it.\n\nIf they won't budge, your choice is to book or not.\n\nDanger list: Humankind's greatest monuments at risk of being lost View Gallery\n\nWhat are the boundaries for an Airbnb host/owner?\n\nHosts are required to ensure every property is secure and safe.\n\nAirbnb's Community Policy states properties must be properly lockable and free of hazards, and hosts must be responsive and willing to answer guest queries within a reasonable time.\n\nAccording to Airbnb, a host cannot physically intrude or interfere with your stay.\n\nThey can only re-enter their property (or a guest's room in a shared stay) if there is an emergency or with express permission.\n\nIn a shared stay, the host must not enter the bathrooms or guest bedrooms when the guests are inside.\n\nThe host is also forbidden from sharing private details, photos, or videos of you without consent.\n\nWhere your safety is threatened, you should contact law enforcement and notify Airbnb.\n\nIf you decide to leave, you may be entitled to a partial refund.\n\nYour rights depend on the cancellation policy applying to your booking (discussed further below).\n\nAn Airbnb host is forbidden from sharing private details, photos or videos of you without consent.\n\nAirbnb's Community Policy states properties must be properly lockable and free of hazards, and hosts must be responsive and willing to answer guest queries within a reasonable time. (9News)\n\nIf I am injured in or get sick because of an Airbnb property, can I claim compensation?\n\nClause 4.2 of Airbnb's terms and conditions states that, by staying at a listed property, you acknowledge and \"freely and willfully\" accept the risk of \"illness, bodily injury, disability, or death\".\n\nFurther, clause 19 contains a broad disclaimer absolving Airbnb of any liability for \"personal or bodily injury or emotional distress\" incurred in using its services.\n\nClause 20 also contains an indemnity preventing you from making any claim against Airbnb in relation to your stay.\n\nThis gives Airbnb legal protection.\n\nBut you may make a claim against the host.\n\nThe first step would be to formally write to the host outlining your claim.\n\nAirbnb may also assist with any disputes.\n\nIf this fails, you can sue the host but whether the cost and effort are worth it will depend on the extent of your injury or illness.\n\nIf you do make any claim against the host, they will likely rely on Airbnb's insurance.\n\nEvery Airbnb host is insured up to about $1.5 million through Airbnb's Host Liability Insurance Programme.\n\nThis covers any bodily injuries incurred by guests (or others) and damage to or theft of any property belonging to a guest (or others).\n\nStaying at a listed Airbnb property means \"freely and willfully\" accepting the risk of \"illness, bodily injury, disability, or death\".\n\nThere are some exceptions to what Airbnb's insurance will cover, such as intentional violence, mould and communicable disease.\n\nIf you want compensation for something the host is personally liable for, you are more likely to have to take legal action, using a lawyer.\n\nConsider the costs carefully.\n\nStaying at a listed Airbnb property means \"freely and willfully\" accepting the risk of \"illness, bodily injury, disability, or death\". (CNN)\n\nWhat's the maximum cleaning/damages fee an Airbnb host can charge?\n\nCleaning fees are set by the host. Airbnb provides a pricing tool to help them calculate a reasonable fee \u2013 generally based on size and facilities \u2013 but there is no maximum, presumably on the rationale that market forces (and reviews) will deter hosts from charging too much.\n\nNor is there a maximum damages fee. You can formally dispute the amount with Airbnb, which will determine if it is reasonable, relying on information provided by both parties.\n\nCharging exorbitant prices is not illegal though Australian Consumer Law does prohibit \"unconscionable conduct\".\n\nBut, again, you need to initiate legal proceedings and have a court agree you deserve compensation.\n\nSign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox.\n\nWhere to go for help and advice\n\nYou can contact Airbnb for any account, listing, or reservation-related questions.\n\nOnline forums can also be useful for advice and support.\n\nYou can report consumer complaints to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission but the federal regulator does not resolve individual complaints or provide legal advice on your rights and obligations.\n\nFor preliminary advice go to the following state and territory consumer advice agencies:"
