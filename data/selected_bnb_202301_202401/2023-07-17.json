In early June, the SEC charged Binance and Coinbase for offering unregistered securities over their platforms."

        "content": "On July 17, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, announced the launch of the arkham (ARKM) token sale on its launchpad, making it the 35th project on the platform.\n\nHowever, ARKM\u2019s launch will be different since there will be mechanisms to \u201cprotect investors from volatility.\u201d At the same time, Binance said the launch of the ARKM will be set at $0.50 \u2014 10 times the public sale price \u2014 for the first five minutes.\n\nAfter the five-minute deadline, the asset\u2019s price will return to normal, and \u201cthere will be no restrictions, and trading will continue as normal.\u201d\n\nYou might also like: Crypto Twitter discusses US XRP ruling, citing possible Binance implications\n\nAccording to Binance, this is the first time the 10X price mechanism has been trialed. However, the exchange did not clarify whether the same will be employed in the future.\n\nMoreover, Binance added that the subscription deadline is set to July 18 at 06:00 UTC. Users can commit BNB based on the average past six-day balance and only use BNB from their spot wallets.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the final results of the ARKM allocation will be publicly available just one hour after the deadline is reached.\n\nThe details of the ARKM launchpad come a few hours after the exchange said they had integrated the Bitcoin Lightening Network.\n\nStill, Arkham\u2019s marketplace launch faced mixed reactions from the crypto community. The blockchain intelligence platform has been accused of collecting private user data."

        "title": "Binance Coin (BNB) price forms a bearish flag as the plot thickens - CoinJournal",
        "content": "BNB coin has become heavily shorted in the perpetual futures market.\n\nIt has also formed a bearish flag pattern on the daily chart.\n\nBinance Coin has come under intense pressure in the past few weeks as short bets in the futures market increased. BNB token was trading at $244 on Monday, lower than last week\u2019s high of $261. In all, it has dropped by over 31% from the highest level this year.\n\nBNB loses momentum\n\nMost cryptocurrencies jumped sharply last week after the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC case. BNB coin, on the other hand, remained in a tight range. It jumped to a high of $261.40 and then erased most of those gains.\n\nBinance Coin has remained under pressure mostly because of the ongoing case, which was brought about by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC accused Binance of committing over 10 crimes, including operating a broker-dealer in the United States without following the law.\n\nIt is too early to predict how the lawsuit will develop and how long it will take. Legal experts I have talked to say that the SEC has a relatively solid case against Binance.\n\nAnother reason why BNB price is struggling is a recent report that Binance had fired over 1,000 employees recently. Like other crypto companies, Binance has gone through major challenges because of the crypto winter.\n\nDespite this, there is a likelihood that the company\u2019s finances are improving as cryptocurrencies recover. Binane has also seen inflows in the past few weeks. According to DeFi Llama, it has had over $2.9 billion in inflows in the past 30 days. Its assets now stands at over $64 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, data shows that many players in the perpetual futures market are short the BNB coin. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that open interest is weighted heavily towards the short-sellers. In a note, an analyst told Coindesk:\n\n\u201cThe sentiment has worsened due to the recent high-profile staff exits, inconsistencies related to BCH withdrawals from Binance.US and the pending Department of Justice case against Binance\u2019s CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao.\u201d\n\nBNB price prediction\n\nThe daily chart shows that the BNB crypto price has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few months. Most recently, the coin has formed what looks like a bearish flag pattern. In price action analysis, this pattern is usually a bearish sign.\n\nBNB coin has moved below the 50-day and 25-day moving averages. Therefore, because of the descending flag pattern, the coin will likely have a bearish breakout in the near term. If this happens, the next level to watch will be at $220.\n\nHow to buy Binance Coin"

        "title": "Bearish Signal: BNB Open Interest Skyrockets To New Highs - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Crypto exchange Binance has been the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny over the last few months and BNB has suffered as a result. Even now, as it seems the crypto exchange is beginning to find its footing once more amid regulatory wolves circling, its native token is still under immense selling pressure. This is evidenced by the BNB open interest, which has now skyrocketed to new all-time highs.\n\nBNB Open Interest Reaches New All-Time High\n\nIn an interesting turn of events, BNB shorts are ramping up even at a time when the crypto market seems to be on a recovery trend. According to a Twitter post by analyst Dylan LeClair, this has caused the open interest in the digital asset to rise exponentially.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCrypto Liquidations Cross $300 Million Amid Massive Market Recovery 10 months ago\n\nThe chart shared by LeClair shows that BNB\u2019s open interest is now sitting at $400 million. This is over four times higher than the previous all-time high for the digital asset which was $50 million back in 2020. And unlike then, the surge in open interest right now is more bearish than it is bullish.\n\nHmmm, some interesting flow in $BNB futures: \u2013 Perpetual futures open interest is seeing new highs as funding rates have gone deeply negative (-200% APR for next funding period) (Chart #1) \u2013 looks as if someone is getting ahead of some bad news flow. \u2013 The last time BNB\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1B27OkjvPx \u2014 Dylan LeClair \ud83d\udfe0 (@DylanLeClair_) July 17, 2023\n\nThis current increase has seen funding rates move above negative 200% and yet traders continue to short the altcoin. The fact that traders are choosing this route despite the high cost to do so points to the expectations of a massive crash coming for the digital asset.\n\nAs LeClair points out, this could mean that the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) is finally leveling charges against the crypto exchange. \u201cAnd people in the know are positioning accordingly.\u201d\n\nWill The Altcoin Survive a DoJ Lawsuit?\n\nAs already demonstrated by the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) lawsuit against the Binance crypto exchange, a lawsuit from regulators would have an adverse impact on the price of BNB. When the SEC sued the exchange in early June, the price of BNB plummeted by over 20% over a few days period.\n\nBNB price continues to hold above $240 | Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com\n\nGiven such a response, a lawsuit from the DoJ would be even worse because of its implications. And if this were to happen this week, then another 20% decline from here would see the digital asset lose its footing above $200.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nPolygon Upgrade Proposal Pushes Price Over 5%, Is It Too Late To Buy? 10 months ago\n\nFor right now, the price of BNB is still holding up nicely above $240. One reason for this could be the Arkham sale being carried out on the Binance launchpad. As this sale requires BNB for subscriptions to participate, it has provided temporary buy pressure for investors to participate. However, once the sale ends on July 18, this temporary plug would be eliminated and the cryptocurrency will likely fall back to the $230 territory."

        "title": "What Is Binance Smart Chain? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "You may have heard about BNB Chain, created by the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The chain, which is the result of a merger of Binance Chain and BNB Smart Chain, has won kudos for its ability to swiftly process transactions while charging low fees. The company, however, currently faces a number of legal and regulatory issues. Read on to learn more about this important player in the world of blockchains.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWhat is BNB Chain? What is BNB Chain? BNB Chain is a blockchain created by Binance (BNB -1.78%), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. The blockchain is fueled by BNB, formerly known as Binance coin. It\u2019s a decentralized, open-source ecosystem that helps users create, store, and exchange data. It supports smart contracts, or programs on a blockchain that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. BNB Chain has its roots in the 2017 founding of Binance by Changpeng Zhao, a Chinese-Canadian software developer, and Yi He, a Chinese businesswoman. The BNB Chain was created by the 2022 merger of Binance Chain, which handled staking and governance, and BNB Smart Chain, an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform. The blockchain uses a proof-of-stake system to validate transactions and govern the network, and it was designed as a high-performance blockchain for smart contracts that would be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nHow is BNB Chain used? How is BNB Chain used? BNB Chain claims to be among the most popular blockchains in the world, recording 4 million daily transactions and more than 1.4 million contracts, according to BSCScan and Solidus Labs. It\u2019s thought to be a low-cost, fast alternative to Ethereum (ETH 0.22%). The BNB Chain\u2019s native cryptocurrency, BNB, has a market cap of almost $50 billion, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC 0.45%), Ethereum, and Tether (USDT). There\u2019s a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps) available on the platform; the applications are programs that operate on peer-to-peer networks and blockchains rather than central servers. BNB claimed more than 4,700 dApps on the blockchain as of mid-2023. Although decentralized apps are often used for social media and gaming purposes, some of the most attractive uses are made in finance. Investors who loan money on a dApp, for example, generally get higher interest rates than if they loan money to a bank since there aren\u2019t any intermediaries. Borrowers also can negotiate rates with lenders, which isn\u2019t always the case for people shopping for a loan. Finally, a smart contract can allow the transaction to take place immediately since no lawyers or other third parties are involved. Getting started on the BNB Chain is an easy, three-step process: Download a crypto wallet to connect to BNB Chain and manage funds;\n\nGet BNB, the BNB Chain currency; and\n\nFind a dApp that you want to use, a game you want to play, or another application that looks interesting.\n\nPros and cons of BNB Chain Pros and cons of BNB Chain Like any other blockchain ecosystem, there are advantages and disadvantages to BNB Chain. And while we generally like to present the pros first, the BNB Chain had some big cons in mid-2023. First and foremost, its parent company Binance Holdings has been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with failing to register its tokens and failing to register its platform before its 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). The SEC investigation isn\u2019t unique to Binance. Ripple Labs (XRP 0.98%), for example, has been fighting with the SEC over whether its token should be considered a security. But the SEC also has charged Binance with a number of securities violations, citing co-founder Zhao\u2019s control of Sigma Chain AG and Merit Peak Ltd., trading firms that act as market makers on the Binance platform. The SEC claims the two firms received unfair speed and access advantages, and it alleges Binance commingled billions of investor assets, sending them to the two firms owned by Zhao. The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission also has weighed in, alleging that Binance traded on its own platform using 300 \u201chouse accounts\u201d without disclosing the information to its customers. Zhao described the CFTC filing as \u201cunexpected and disappointing,\u201d noting that the company had been cooperating with the regulator for more than two years. Finally, there\u2019s the question of security. Although Binance notes that no investor lost money, an October 2022 exploit prompted the company to pause its BNB Smart Chain after hackers made off with more than $100 million. The company promised to alter its governance to prevent further exploits. To be sure, BNB Chain has some advantages. It supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and other protocols so users from other blockchains can easily migrate their dApps. The blockchain also has cross-chain bridging that allows Tether and Ethereum developers to use it. It supports most popular programming languages and has extensive documentation. The BNB Chain also uses the proof-of-stake method to validate blocks. The method leads to faster transactions, lower gas fees, and a much smaller carbon footprint.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nExample of BNB Chain use Example of BNB Chain use PancakeSwap (CAKE -1.65%) is one of the best-known decentralized exchanges (DEX) on the BNB Chain. It allows users to swap coins without having to pay an intermediary. PancakeSwap focuses on BEP-20 tokens developed by Binance, which announced a \u201cstrategic investment\u201d in the exchange in June 2022 for an undisclosed amount. The exchange has been the network\u2019s largest dApp, with more than 400,000 daily active users and almost $5 billion in total value locked (TVL). PancakeSwap users can also buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs), participate in lotteries, and earn rewards by depositing tokens with PancakeSwap. Despite its promise, the dApp wasn\u2019t doing so well midway through 2023. In 2021, PancakeSwap was offering rates that topped 100% to investors who staked their native crypto token, CAKE. Prices for the token, however, began plunging in April 2023 after the company proposed slowing the rate of inflation for the token from rates that topped 20% to a range between 3% and 5%. Its market capitalization has fallen from $6.75 billion in April 2021 to about $323 million midway through 2023. While you can\u2019t draw a straight line from PancakeSwap\u2019s troubles to its location on the BNB Chain, it\u2019s not a good sign when the value of one of a blockchain\u2019s flagship dApps tanks as hard as PancakeSwap. As with any other investment involving cryptocurrency, investors should only spend money that they\u2019re prepared to lose."
