Since then, its stock has soared more than 3,000%, fueled not by software sales or product innovation, but the price of bitcoin. That was true for Classover and GD Culture, both of which proposed multi-hundred-million-dollar allocations despite being worth a fraction of that.It\u2019s unclear whether these companies will actually make their proposed purchases or how they plan to raise the funds. It now holds 3,634 BTC on its balance sheet, reflecting a strategy that mirrors MicroStrategy\u2019s playbook rather than simply borrowing its headlines.Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards."

Once a top 20 cryptocurrency, ICON\u2019s ICX token crashed nearly 99% from its all-time highs by late 2018, and has since not recovered, according to CoinGecko data, as investors moved toward platforms better able to capitalize on the rise of DeFi and NFTs.\u201cLayer-1 infrastructure just doesn't make sense for most projects,\u201d Kim argued. There's been a misguided premium investors placed on Layer-1 projects, thinking an ecosystem would naturally build itself. While Sonic and SODAX\u2019s tokens remain distinct, Kim emphasized that Sonic\u2019s fee-monetization mechanisms will channel transaction fees back to SODA holders.\u201cSonic allows 90% of transaction fees to flow back to SODA token holders,\u201d Kim noted, underscoring the economic incentive of their strategic pivot.Asked if this outsourcing model represents a broader trend, Kim predicted that many projects currently running Layer-1s will likely reconsider as market cycles shift.\u201cEthereum and Solana are great examples as they\u2019re fully focused on validators and network security,\" he said."

The token, launched in late 2023, saw a rapid growth in its early months to $150 million supply, coinciding with a reward program, but then declined to $50 million, per RWA.xyz data.Mountain Protocol said in a blog post that it will phase out its USDM token in an \"an orderly wind-down process\" as part of the acquisition.UPDATE (May 12, 21:13 UTC): Adds Mountain Protocol decision to phase out USDM."

Meanwhile, ETH, SOL, DOGE and LINK remained below the average, data from TradingView show.That's an improvement from the end of April, when only XRP, BTC and TRX traded above their 200-day SMAS, and four weeks ago, when only XRP and TRX held above the average.The data indicates the bull market is fast expanding beyond a select few coins to signal growing investor confidence."

The Florida-based company now holds 595,988 SOL, worth nearly $105 million at current prices.The company said the tokens will be held long-term and staked with a range of validators, including its own, to earn staking yield. SOL advanced over 20% over the past week, touching $180 for the first time since February.The move reflects a growing trend of public companies buying cryptocurrencies for their balance sheets, mimicking the playbook of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR).While many companies are following Saylor's lead and focusing on bitcoin BTC, the largest cryptocurrency, others are looking at alternatives. Last month, Janover was taken over by a group of former executives of crypto exchange Kraken and pivoted to focus on the Solana blockchain, accumulating the network's native token and operating validators to earn a staking yield."

Meanwhile, dips near $25 have consistently found support, keeping the price within a narrow range.On Sunday, buyers finally managed to chew through the long-held supply zone of $40-$43, hitting a high of $45.80 on crypto exchange HTX, the level last seen on Jan. 26, according to data source TradingView.The so-called range breakout is like a spring uncoiling bullishly after building up demand during consolidation. In ZEC's case, the measured move method points to a rally toward $60.Price moves through long-held resistance levels, as in ZEC's case, often draws bids from breakout traders. Readers should note that chart patterns do not always work as intended."
