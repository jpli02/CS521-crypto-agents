Since then, its stock has soared more than 3,000%, fueled not by software sales or product innovation, but the price of bitcoin. That was true for Classover and GD Culture, both of which proposed multi-hundred-million-dollar allocations despite being worth a fraction of that.It\u2019s unclear whether these companies will actually make their proposed purchases or how they plan to raise the funds.

The process, especially for proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin, is energy intensive, providing an incentive for unscrupulous miners to steal, rather than pay, for the electricity they use while reaping the reward in the form of new tokens for completing the process.The largest leap in numbers occurred after 2020. Between 2020 and 2024, the average number of crypto-related electricity theft cases was 2,303 per year, TNB told The Star. The number of public complaints also rose due to increased awareness of how to report the illicit crypto mining TNB added.Crypto mining is not banned in Malaysia, but anyone who tampers with electrical installations is liable to a fine of 1 million ringgit ($232,720.50) and up to 10 years imprisonment.CoinDesk reached out to Tenaga Nasional Berhad for a comment."
