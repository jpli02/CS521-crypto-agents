        "summary": "Education tech firm Classover Holdings (KIDZ) said in early May that it would sell $400 million worth of shares to buy solana. Since then, its stock has soared more than 3,000%, fueled not by software sales or product innovation, but the price of bitcoin. That was true for Classover and GD Culture, both of which proposed multi-hundred-million-dollar allocations despite being worth a fraction of that.It\u2019s unclear whether these companies will actually make their proposed purchases or how they plan to raise the funds. It now holds 3,634 BTC on its balance sheet, reflecting a strategy that mirrors MicroStrategy\u2019s playbook rather than simply borrowing its headlines.Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards."

        "summary": "NEW YORK, NY \u2014 New York Mayor Eric Adams is making a pitch to crypto companies returning to the U.S. or expanding their presence in the country: set up shop in New York City.\u201cThis is the Empire State,\u201d Adams said at a press briefing at Gracie Mansion on Monday. \u201cWe should be looking forward to building empires, particularly in the crypto space.\u201dAdams, who is running for reelection, reiterated his commitment to making New York City a crypto hub, telling reporters that he would work with tech and crypto companies, both big and small, to create a friendly environment to attract them and help them succeed.\u201cMy goal remains the same as it was on day one as mayor: making New York City the crypto capital of the globe,\u201d Adams said. His remarks echo similar pledges from President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet.\u201dAdams is also taking inspiration from Trump in another way: next week, he\u2019s hosting New York City\u2019s first-ever Crypto Summit, which he said will bring together city officials and representatives from the crypto industry to discuss ways the city can benefit from crypto \u2014\u00a0and vice versa. In the past, Adams has been critical of the Bitlicense, claiming that it stifled regulation and advocating for scrapping it shortly after taking office as mayor in 2022.When asked about New York\u2019s regulatory environment on Monday, however, Adams seemed to strike a more conciliatory tone towards NYDFS, saying that \u201cit\u2019s good to know that the city is going to have safe regulations in place for those who are investing, and there\u2019s not going to be any abuses.\u201d\u201cBut at the same time, we can overregulate and prevent growth,\u201d Adams added."

        "summary": "Outsourcing to Sonic allows us to focus on innovation and delivering products that people actually want.\u201dKim also highlighted the risk reduction benefits, noting that ICON\u2019s DeFi layer can remain unaffected by infrastructure issues at Sonic, creating a valuable risk separation.\u201cThere's de-risking,\u201d he explained. Once a top 20 cryptocurrency, ICON\u2019s ICX token crashed nearly 99% from its all-time highs by late 2018, and has since not recovered, according to CoinGecko data, as investors moved toward platforms better able to capitalize on the rise of DeFi and NFTs.\u201cLayer-1 infrastructure just doesn't make sense for most projects,\u201d Kim argued. There's been a misguided premium investors placed on Layer-1 projects, thinking an ecosystem would naturally build itself. While Sonic and SODAX\u2019s tokens remain distinct, Kim emphasized that Sonic\u2019s fee-monetization mechanisms will channel transaction fees back to SODA holders.\u201cSonic allows 90% of transaction fees to flow back to SODA token holders,\u201d Kim noted, underscoring the economic incentive of their strategic pivot.Asked if this outsourcing model represents a broader trend, Kim predicted that many projects currently running Layer-1s will likely reconsider as market cycles shift.\u201cEthereum and Solana are great examples as they\u2019re fully focused on validators and network security,\" he said."

Blobs, introduced during the Dencun upgrade, are dedicated spaces for large chunks of data related to transactions. They are stored off-chain, which reduces congestion on the Ethereum blockchain and lowers gas fees. \u201cPeerDAS is super important since we want to help layer-2s scale,\u201d said Parithosh Jayanti, a devops engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, to CoinDesk over Telegram."

Meanwhile, ETH, SOL, DOGE and LINK remained below the average, data from TradingView show.That's an improvement from the end of April, when only XRP, BTC and TRX traded above their 200-day SMAS, and four weeks ago, when only XRP and TRX held above the average.The data indicates the bull market is fast expanding beyond a select few coins to signal growing investor confidence."

The Florida-based company now holds 595,988 SOL, worth nearly $105 million at current prices.The company said the tokens will be held long-term and staked with a range of validators, including its own, to earn staking yield. SOL advanced over 20% over the past week, touching $180 for the first time since February.The move reflects a growing trend of public companies buying cryptocurrencies for their balance sheets, mimicking the playbook of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR).While many companies are following Saylor's lead and focusing on bitcoin BTC, the largest cryptocurrency, others are looking at alternatives. Last month, Janover was taken over by a group of former executives of crypto exchange Kraken and pivoted to focus on the Solana blockchain, accumulating the network's native token and operating validators to earn a staking yield."

Meanwhile, dips near $25 have consistently found support, keeping the price within a narrow range.On Sunday, buyers finally managed to chew through the long-held supply zone of $40-$43, hitting a high of $45.80 on crypto exchange HTX, the level last seen on Jan. 26, according to data source TradingView.The so-called range breakout is like a spring uncoiling bullishly after building up demand during consolidation. In ZEC's case, the measured move method points to a rally toward $60.Price moves through long-held resistance levels, as in ZEC's case, often draws bids from breakout traders. Readers should note that chart patterns do not always work as intended."
