        "title": "Solana Price May Fall To $21 Before It Stages Another Recovery - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Over the last week, the price of Solana has risen. During the same time frame, SOL surged close to 17%. Although the bulls were in the market, SOL was not entirely out of the woods. The price was dragged to the $21 mark recently after the bears attempted to drag the price down.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nNew Proposal Wants To Burn All Coins In LUNC Oracle Pool, Will This Help The Price? 1 year ago\n\nThe technical outlook of Solana depicted that the bulls were present on the one-day chart. Buying strength registered an increase as demand also moved up. With demand going north, accumulation also noted a positive change.\n\nThe asset\u2019s price must remain above the $21 support level; otherwise, a fall through that price mark will bring the bears back in full force. As Bitcoin tries to break past the $28,500 level, other altcoins also attempt to target their immediate price ceiling.\n\nThe movement of the king coin will determine the price direction of other altcoins. The volatility of the SOL price will start declining once the demand for the altcoin stabilizes over the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nSolana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart\n\nSOL was trading at $22.50 at the time of writing. Over the past trading sessions, however, the bears dragged the price to the crucial support line of $21.50. The local support level for the coin was $21.\n\nThe $21 price level has acted as a propelling point for the altcoin, so another dip to this level might shoot the price to $23 or above. The inability to sustain a price above $21 will bring SOL to $20.\n\nOn the other hand, overhead resistance for SOL was at $23.40; breaching past that will push the price to $24. This level may act as strict resistance for the altcoin.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nSOL has depicted a recovery in buying strength over the last trading session. The Relative Strength Index noted an uptick and moved near the 60-mark, meaning the buyers were in charge of the market. Similarly, with increased demand, SOL moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line.\n\nThis indicated that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. SOL price is standing at a crucial point because a slight push from buyers will take the altcoin above the 50-SMA and 200-SMA lines, respectively. That would be a sign of increased bullishness.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence depicts the price momentum, which turned positive. The green histograms were related to buy signals for the altcoin. Buyers\u2019 interest also grew as SOL remained bullish in the past few days.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCardano Has To Trade Above This Level To Breach The $0.40 Mark 1 year ago\n\nThis usually means that there could be an upward increase in price over the next trading session. The Chaikin Money Flow reads the capital inflows and outflows at a given time. The indicator noted a small uptick pushing the capital inflows into the positive zone.\n\nFeatured Image From UnSplash, Charts From TradingView.com"

Bitcoin's value dropped below $27,000 after the decision but has since risen to $27,300. On Wednesday, BTC's price surged to $28,700, its highest point since June, as some investors hoped that the Fed would cease its hawkish interest rate hikes in light of recent bank failures.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cThe price of Bitcoin experienced a significant pullback following the release of a statement from the US Federal Reserve regarding interest rates. The Fed announced that while they are committed to supporting the economic recovery, they believe that raising interest rates aggressively may not be appropriate at this time. This caused some uncertainty and volatility in the market, leading to Bitcoin's price briefly dropping by over 7 percent to now stabilizing in the $27,300 range.\"\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cBitcoin and most major cryptos saw a price decline after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points, prioritising inflation over recent banking crises. Investors hoped for a more dovish approach from the Fed after the banking crisis, but the central bank chose to raise interest rates, causing Bitcoin to dip below $27,000 and Ether to fall to $1,737.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cThe US Federal Reserve announced a quarter percentage point hike in key interest rates at its latest meeting on Wednesday. The federal funds rate is now 4.75 percent - 5 percent. However, in light of the recent turmoil in the financial sector following the collapse of two banks, the Fed has signalled that it will hold off on further rate hikes. As a result, the market saw prices drop, with BTC falling from $28,900 to $27,300, ETH to $1,740, ADA down 20 cents to around $0.35, and BNB trading at $320.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe Bitcoin rally was interrupted by the interest rate hike of 25 basis points announced by the Fed in the latest FOMC meeting. BTC and ETH dropped by 2.48 percent and 3.11 percent, respectively, while other digital assets followed a similar trend. The evolving banking situation in the US is making investors jittery and markets are expected to remain choppy in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
