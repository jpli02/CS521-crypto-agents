        "title": "Rowe teachers request salary boost, culture shift - Rancho Santa Fe Review",
        "content": "As contract negotiations continue between the Rancho Santa Fe School District and the Rancho Santa Fe School Faculty Association, teachers marched along the R. Roger Rowe School morning drop-off line on May 26. Signs toted by staff included \u201cTeachers united for quality pay\u201d and \u201cOur working conditions are their learning conditions\u201d.\n\nAccording to a representative from the faculty association (RSFA), negotiation sessions so far have been \u201cpromising\u201d and they have plans to come to the table again with their proposal on May 30. As the district looks to restructure the salary schedule this year, the RSFA is looking for increased wages and healthcare benefits and for the district to consider master\u2019s degree and longevity stipends, which the district has never offered its teachers.\n\nMembers of the RSFA\u2019s negotiating team most recently spoke out to the board during public comment at an April board meeting, advocating for a fair wage that would allow the district to retain and attract talented teachers.\n\n\u201cOur impressive test scores and the students\u2019 excitement when they arrive to school each day are a testament to the incredible environment the staff has cultivated over the years,\u201d said fourth grade teacher Haley Bradford said. \u201cThis educational experience would not be possible without the amazing teachers we have here at R. Roger Rowe.\u201d\n\nThe teachers are looking to be compensated similarly to educators in surrounding districts. Bradford said previously the average salary difference between RSF and districts like San Dieguito and Solana Beach used to be 9% but the gap has widened to 13.72%. Teacher Janel Maud said that Rowe teachers are paid far less for providing an above-average educational experience.\n\n\u201cThe Rancho Santa Fe School District expects to have the best teachers on the cheap,\u201d Maud said. \u201cWe have the opportunity to change the culture of our learning community in order to reflect what is most important to our school: an amazing experience for our students.\u201d\n\nTeachers received a 4% salary increase in 2021 for the 2020-22 school years. The board approved a budget for this school year with slight deficit spending, reflecting its commitment to set aside funding to replace the gym roof this summer. Looking ahead, the district is proposing to deficit spend for the next two years but maintains a reserve level of 22.7% or $3.3 million, above the state\u2019s required 3% reserve.\n\nThe board will adopt its budget for the 2023-24 school year in June\u2014the annual budget hearing will be held on Friday, June 9 at 8:30 a.m."
