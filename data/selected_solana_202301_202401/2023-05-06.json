        "title": "Sui Is Built for Games\u2014Here's Why Developers Are Bullish - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLayer-1 blockchain network Sui has already positioned itself as one of the most appealing destinations for Web3 game developers\u2014despite being the newest to the game so far.\n\nPolygon, Immutable, Avalanche, and Solana have growing Web3 gaming ecosystems with a wide variety of games in all stages of development. But Sui, which just launched its mainnet on Wednesday, offers unique technical specifications and a different approach to on-chain assets that\u2019s made it a compelling alternative for budding game makers.\n\nPart of what makes Sui unique is its ability to process transactions in parallel, as well as scale horizontally by adding more nodes to keep up with demand\u2014two features designed to keep its transaction fees very low as more and more games and decentralized apps (dapps) come online. Dynamically-updated NFTs and an \"object-based\" model may also prove appealing to game designers, Sui creator Mysten Labs claims.\n\nSui is not Ethereum-compatible via the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which sets it apart from some of the established Web3 gaming networks out there, but Mysten believes that the network\u2019s innate gaming appeal will allow it to onboard mainstream gamers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGame-first approach\n\nMysten Labs\u2019 Head of Gaming Partnerships Anthony Palma told Decrypt in an interview that over 40 games are building on Sui so far\u2014even though the mainnet has only been live for a few days.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to go after not \u2018blockchain games\u2019 or \u2018crypto games,\u2019\u201d Palma said, \u201cbut to go after great games built by great game developers that want to leverage Web3 to enhance their player experience, and provide more engagement and agency.\u201d\n\nPalma echoed a growing sentiment about Web3 games putting gameplay before any crypto elements\u2014a take that leaders at firms like Magic Eden, Ava Labs, Solana Foundation, Gala Games, and others have expressed in recent months.\n\nWhen it comes to Sui\u2019s technical appeal, Palma shared that Sui is an \u201cobject-based\u201d chain. Broadly, what that means is that the network is well-optimized for games, which consist of hundreds if not thousands of in-game objects created in game engines like Unreal Engine 5 or Unity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\ud83d\udca5Get ready to play on @SuiNetwork! \ud83d\udcfaWatch real gameplay footage of these incredible Mysten Labs' partners: pic.twitter.com/66qlt5n68Y \u2014 Mysten Labs (@Mysten_Labs) May 1, 2023\n\nPalma believes that Sui allows game developers to more easily and seamlessly evolve in-game asset NFTs over time, because Sui\u2019s on-chain assets can change dynamically in real-time as players are leveling up items like a sword, for example.\n\nEvolving game assets\n\nRival player kills and achievements secured with specific items can be added to that item\u2019s metadata\u2014or the data that describes the unique attributes of an NFT\u2014automatically, allowing players to \u201cwrite\u201d their own histories with each item as they play.\n\n\u201cIf somebody sees there's a sword with 10,000 kills, versus the same sword with 100 kills, the 10,000-kill sword is just gonna inherently carry more value,\u201d Palma argued.\n\n\u201cBut it also allows you to do things like upgrading the NFT based on its metadata,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou could do something like have a sword go from \u2018gold\u2019 to \u2018legendary\u2019 to \u2018mythic,\u2019 if you have a system like that.\"\n\nAbyss World. Image: Metagame Industries / Steam.\n\nSuch dynamic items are possible on Sui without having to burn and reissue items to reflect the new data, as developers might on other blockchain networks. When tokens are burned and re-minted on other chains, their histories are typically lost unless developers make a point of manually adding an item\u2019s previous data to the new one.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to do this on another chain, you would either be doing a ton of syncing between your central database\u2014where this info usually exists\u2014and the on-chain transaction history,\u201d Palma said, \u201cor you would be burning the NFTs and re-minting new ones to go from 'gold' to 'mythic.'\"\n\n\u201cSui\u2019s dynamic model allows you to keep all of that provenance, which should drive the value of these items over time\u2014both for players and for the ecosystem,\u201d he added. \u201cSo it's just a really cool new feature that you can bake into your games that wasn't really possible on-chain before.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSui developers speak\n\nMysten Labs has been working closely with game developers\u2014the startup behind Sui won\u2019t be taking a hands-off approach, said Palma. Over the next month, numerous games will launch on Sui, including a \"Walking Dead\" game and Final Stardust from Orange Comet, Project Eluune from Arrivant, and Run Legends from Talofa Games, as well as metaverse game Worlds Beyond plus the Overwatch-esque Bushi.\n\nBut what do game developers building on Sui think about the network, and what\u2019s drawn them to build on it?\n\nGhost Ivy, a Web3 game studio building a first-person shooter (FPS) game called Haven\u2019s Compass for PC and mobile, chose Sui because of its \u201cusability\u201d for gaming.\n\nA still from FPS Haven's Compass. Image: Ghost Ivy on YouTube.\n\n\u201cIt was a hard decision,\u201d Ghost Ivy CEO Fares Alu-Taleb told Decrypt about choosing Sui. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s important that the game can stay online nonstop, and that the players won\u2019t need any interaction with the blockchain. Sui makes this easier for us as developers.\u201d\n\nAbyss World is another Web3 game in development from Metagame Industries that will leverage Sui in a number of ways. Its developers want Abyss World to be a high-end, \u201cAAA\u201d role-playing game (RPG) that offers both player vs. player (PVP) and player vs. environment (PVE) game experiences, as well as an auto-battler mode through cloud gaming\u2014which means the game can be played on either a phone or PC without having to download any files.\n\nThere will be in-game items that can be earned on-chain through gameplay in Abyss World, as well as via in-game \u201cminting factories\u201d where players can put existing items on-chain.\n\n\u201cThe transaction speed is super fast,\u201d Metagame President Kinson Hou told Decrypt about Sui. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the only blockchains that can go to the internet\u2019s scale.\u201d\n\nAbyss World. Image: Metagame Industries / Steam.\n\nAbyss World also wants players to be able to launch their own private servers. Hou sees that as an important part of its community-driven model, in which all game events impact other players and gamers get to create a collective \u201cplayer-driven history\u201d in a singular timeline.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe want to build the infinite game,\u201d Hou said."
