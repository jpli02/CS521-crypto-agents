        "content": "Gamers Cough up Huge Sums to Get Ahead in Dookey Dash\n\nThe recently launched Dookey Dash game by Yuga Labs has experienced a growing number of cheaters looking to boost their overall scores. Ranking first on the leaderboard is the ultimate goal, as this will guarantee an individual the top prize.\n\nYuga Labs launched Dookey Dash, an endless runner game, three weeks ago with the promise of presenting the top scorer with a mysterious reward. In an effort to maximize their scores, some players have used \u201cboosters.\u201d These are hired players who will log into an account and frequently use cheats and exploits to record the highest possible score. However, these services are not cheap.\n\nOne such boosting service revealed that it charges players a minimum of 0.25 ETH, or $420 to record a score of over 250,000, with higher scores costing even more. For example, a score of over 700,000 will set gamers back an eye-popping 2.5 ETH, or $3,880 as of press time.\n\nAnother booster service claims to charge 0.2 ETH, or $330, for scores over 200,000.\n\nWhat Was Dookey Dash All About?\n\nPlaying Dookey Dash began on January 18 and ended on February 8. Gamers required a Sewer Pass to participate, with the passes initially available only to Bored Ape Yacht Club or Mutant Ape NFT holders. Then, they could play the endless runner game, with the score rising the longer they last without hitting obstacles. Eventually, the pass could evolve into different rewards, depending on how well gamers did in the game.\n\nNow the scores will be frozen, with Yuga Labs set to \u201csummon\u201d the Sewer Passes on February 15. After which, valid Sewer Passes will transform into something else, most likely a limited edition NFT that will evolve throughout the year.\n\nWhether Or Not Dookey Dash Cheaters Will Be Caught Is Debatable\n\nHowever, those who spent money to boost their scores might be in for a rude awakening. Yuga Labs will still have to validate them, and those found cheating will be dismissed. Adam Hollander, who owns BAYC #3987, notes that \u201cwhen Yuga runs their audits, those passes will be disqualified & become worthless. \u201c\n\nOthers, however, are skeptical that Yuga Labs will be able to nab all cheaters. A hacker who goes by the name ClearHat tweeted that \u201cDookey Dash was widely botted. Our team soon discovered that it was possible to plug in a \u2018course seed\u2019 and generate the exact architecture/map of the course, down to the very last obstacle, at the start of every game, and it is 100% undetectable.\u201d\n\nBefore adding, \u201cIf they invalidate any of the scores, it would have to be based on their subjective assessment of whether it \u2018looks\u2019 like a bot or not, and that\u2019s not a good strategy.\u201d\n\nWant more?

        "content": "TORONTO, Feb. 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- As the Web3 ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, The first new Layer 1 blockchains like Solana, Near, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain have emerged as formidable competitors to the established Ethereum network. These new blockchains are leveraging their own unique features and capabilities to carve out a space for themselves in the market.\n\nAccording to blockchain technology expert Pardeep Narwal, new blockchains like Solana, Near, Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain offer faster speeds and better scalability than Ethereum network due to their use of different algorithms. These new blockchains also have unique use cases, such as proof of stake, proof of time and space, proof of location, and proof of history, which have real-world applications and make them exciting.\n\nThe emergence of new Layer 1 blockchains like Solana, Near, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain was built during the downtime of the previous cycle around 2018 to 2020 and challenged the dominance of Ethereum by offering faster speeds, better scalability, and unique use cases. These new blockchains are proving to be a formidable force in the rapidly expanding Web3 ecosystem but it's not enough and not a final chance for investors.\n\nThe second chance for investors\n\nThese are the returns on investment (ROI) for Solana, Avalanche, and Near Protocol from the last bear market to the present day. The ROI is measured by comparing average prices during the bear market to current prices during the bull market.\n\nHowever, there is a growing interest in blockchain technology that focuses on building super Dapps (decentralized applications) and integrating artificial intelligence (AI). This is because super Dapps are expected to have a wider range of functionality and capabilities than traditional Dapps, and the integration of AI can enable them to perform more complex tasks and provide more advanced services.\n\nFor investors, this could represent a new opportunity to invest in blockchain projects that have the potential to create innovative and valuable solutions for various industries. These projects may have a higher chance of success and generate higher returns for investors compared to traditional Dapps or blockchain projects that do not incorporate AI.\n\nUnicorn Ultra (U2U) is a blockchain focus to AI and Super Dapps\n\nOne blockchain that supports both AI and super Dapps is Unicorn Ultra (U2U). Unicorn Ultra (U2U) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that aims to provide a new infrastructure for building and deploying super Dapps. The platform uses a unique consensus mechanism called \"smart ledgers\" which combines elements of HyperLedger technologies. This allows for faster and more efficient transactions, which is crucial for the deployment of super Dapps.\n\nUnicorn Ultra (U2U) has integrated AI capabilities into its platform, allowing for the deployment of AI-powered Dapps and services. The platform uses a virtual machine called the \"U2U Machine\" which is designed to support AI and machine learning applications. This allows for the deployment of advanced AI-powered Dapps such as autonomous agents, which are self-executing programs that can perform tasks and make decisions on their own.\n\nUnicorn Ultra (U2U)'s super Dapps and AI capabilities can be used in a variety of industries such as finance, transportation, and energy. For example, in finance, the platform can be used to create decentralized financial markets and exchanges. In transportation, the platform can be used to create decentralized ride-sharing services and autonomous vehicles.
