        "title": "\u2018Absolutely Feasible\u2019 for Solana To Explode by Over 220% Going Forward, Says InvestAnswers - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that another rise of over 3x is in the cards for one red-hot altcoin that has already skyrocketed about 1,000% since the start of the year.\n\nIn a new video update, the anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 461,000 YouTube subscribers that the smart contract platform Solana (SOL) could still see a significant price rise going forward.\n\nAccording to the strategist, he sees Solana\u2019s dominance rising to 3% and the total market cap of crypto ascending to $5 trillion. SOL dominance is a metric that tracks how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to the Ethereum (ETH) rival.\n\nThe analyst notes that Solana\u2019s growing dominance combined with the rising total crypto market cap could mean that SOL may hit a price tag well above $300.\n\n\u201cSOL dominance it\u2019s already at like 2.4%, 2.5%. Could it hit 3%? Yes \u2013 if that\u2019s the case, 3% of 5 trillion is $150 billion, which takes the price of Solana to $363.\n\nWell, I\u2019m going to back that number with another metric as well. If you asked me a year ago when SOL was at $8 [if] would it hit $363, [I\u2019d have] said you\u2019re crazy. Now, it\u2019s absolutely feasible.\u201d\n\nLooking at another metric, the analyst says that if SOL\u2019s share of Ethereum\u2019s market cap rises to just 20%, it would translate to a price target of $366 for Solana.\n\n\u201c$366 is very similar to $363 which is based on 3% of crypto market dominance at a $5 trillion total valuation. So it\u2019s interesting how those two are almost bang on. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always been there in my calculations since 2021 as an easy hurdle to achieve.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $110.40, a decrease of more than 2.60% in the last 24 hours. A move toward the analyst\u2019s price target suggests an upside potential of more than 228% for SOL.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Every crypto trader is asking the same question: will Solana keep going up?\n\nWell without a crystal ball handy, let\u2019s look at some technical analysis and sentiment for Solana.\n\nSolana is working on massive gains after climbing more than 109% over the past 30 days.\n\nJust how long will this run go for?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOL/USD \u2013 SWING BUY OPPORTUNITY on TradingView.com\n\nAccording to some trade ideas on TradingView, it looks like there\u2019s still some buying opportunity in the short term to accumulate more SOL.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to advocate for opening a big position after such gains, it still looks like SOL has some room to run.\n\nZooming out a bit \u2014 a critical level for SOL to reach was $113 \u2014 which it had no problem smashing through.\n\nThe rapid rise in price has caused some crypto traders to lock in profits, which is never a bad idea.\n\nIn your opinion, what\u2019s this cycle\u2019s $AVAX, $LUNA, or $SOL? In other words, a token that has huge upside potential. And yes, $SOL could still do a 10x from here\u2026but I\u2019m thinking about something more undiscovered. \u2014 Route 2 FI (@Route2FI) December 25, 2023\n\nOne counter point to the tweet above is that for long-term investors, holding the bag may be more fruitful than aggressively searching for the next token to rise.\n\nWill Solana reach $250 in 2024?\n\nOur current Solana analysis forecast shows marks $143 as the key resistance area.\n\nTraders can expect some sell offs along the way. Especially around areas of price resistance.\n\nBesides, if we\u2019ve learned anything from the latest crypto winter, it\u2019s that pullbacks are to be expected.\n\n$250 seems like more of a realistic number to hit in 2025 or 2026 (conservatively).\n\nWill Solana crash soon?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s define \u2018crash\u2019 in crypto terms.\n\nTraders and investors alike are used to drawdowns across the crypto landscape.\n\nBut a full-blown crash seems unlikely here. If you\u2019re looking for another buying opportunity, levels around the $100 mark could be appealing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLANA RESISTANCE AND SUPPORT by laganicapobeda99 on TradingView.com\n\nAnother trading idea from the TradingView community presents a short-term bear case with support around the $60-70 range.\n\nWhile it would be surprising to see $SOL hitting that level any time soon, it\u2019s always smart to DYOR (do your own research) and understand the risks involved with crypto.\n\nWill the Bitcoin Spot ETF affect SOL?\n\nArguably the biggest storyline in crypto right now is the anticipation of BlackRock\u2019s BTC spot ETF.\n\nRecent reports suggest that the BTC spot ETF will be funded with $10,000,000 on Jan. 3, 2024.\n\nThe $10M figure is significant because it\u2019s a large bump up from the initial seeding of $100,000 in Oct. \u201923.\n\nPending approval, this could mark the sign of true institutional adoption within the crypto space.\n\nThis, by in large, should prompt good tailwinds for a crypto bull run in 2024.\n\nNow, what does this have to do with Solana?\n\nIf institutions are seeing the value in crypto \u2014 it could benefit the landscape as a whole, which includes Solana as a prominent name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOL \u2013 Trading in nice Executed Head and Shoulders End Pattern ! by TiDu1981 on TradingView.com\n\nSummary\n\nWe\u2019d expect a minor drawdown when the hype of the BTC spot ETF wears off, but we have 2024 forecasted for a big year in crypto.\n\nSolana remains one of the most intriguing names in blockchain, and if they continue to execute on their project, we expect investor sentiment to remain high throughout 2024.\n\n$250 is certainly in sight for Solana, but we wouldn\u2019t expect this price target to be hit until 2025.\n\nFor more detailed follow ups, but also for top crypto tips, we recommend to follow our premium crypto charting alerts in which we share much more details across 35 tokens, with timely insights combined with perfectly timed buy alerts.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not financial advice.

        "title": "MKBHD's \"Bust of the Year\" Award Goes to Solana Mobile's Sold-Out Saga Phone - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Saga, a smartphone developed by Solana Mobile for the crypto community, has been named the \u201cBust of the Year\u201d by Marques Brownlee (MKBHD), a prominent tech reviewer.\n\nSolana Mobile, a branch of Solana Labs, ventured into the smartphone industry with the launch of the Saga in April 2023.\n\nPriced initially at $1,000, the phone saw a price reduction in August to broaden its user base.\n\nNow is the perfect time to switch to Saga.\n\n\n\nOrder Saga here: https://t.co/4ZIEs6Z0D7 \u2014 Solana Mobile \ud83c\udf31 (@solanamobile) August 9, 2023\n\nThe Saga, developed with OSOM\u2019s expertise, aims to revolutionize Web3 interactions on mobile devices, focusing on secure cryptocurrency and NFT transactions.\n\nThe Saga boasts a 6.67-inch OLED screen, 12 GB RAM, and 512 GB storage, powered by the Snapdragon\u00ae 8+ Gen 1 Mobile Platform. Its standout feature is the Solana Mobile Stack (SMS), integrating crypto functionalities into the phone\u2019s hardware and software. The \u201cseed vault\u201d securely stores private keys, and the phone offers a unique dapp store, free from the high fees typical of Apple and Google\u2019s app stores.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, envisioned the Saga as a benchmark for mobile Web3 experiences. However, MKBHD\u2019s review in September painted a different picture. He traced the Saga\u2019s origins to the Essential Phone team, now part of OSOM. While praising its build quality, including a matte stainless steel frame and ceramic back, he noted its hefty weight and average specifications, such as a 1080p display and mediocre cameras. These factors, coupled with its initial high price, contributed to its later price reduction.\n\nMarques Brownlee, also known as MKBHD, is a well-known American YouTuber, best recognized for his technology-focused content. He produces in-depth reviews, discussions, and analyses of various consumer electronics, including smartphones, computers, and other gadgets. Brownlee is highly regarded in the tech community for his insightful and detailed approach to tech reviews, offering viewers a comprehensive understanding of the latest technological advancements and products. His channel has garnered widespread popularity for its quality content and Brownlee\u2019s expertise in the tech field.\n\nBack in September, MKBHD reviewed the Saga, highlighting its crypto-centric features: the SMS, Seed Vault, and Dapp store. However, he critiqued the SMS for its exclusive focus on the Solana blockchain, limiting its appeal. The Seed Vault, while secure, and the Dapp store, though unique, did not fully justify the phone\u2019s price, even after the reduction.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the Saga saw a sales surge in mid-December 2023, driven by the crypto community\u2019s enthusiasm. Each Saga owner was entitled to an airdrop of 30 million Bonk (BONK) tokens, potentially equating to a $1,000 return on a $599 investment. This led to the phone selling out, as announced by Solana Mobile on social media platform X.\n\nThe Saga is SOLD OUT!\n\n\n\nWords cannot describe how much we appreciate your support. We are nothing without this amazing community \ud83e\udec2\n\n\n\nWhile these past few days will be cemented in our history, we\u2019re excited for the future \ud83e\udee1\n\n\n\nStay tuned \u2728 pic.twitter.com/KJje8lBDLL \u2014 Solana Mobile \ud83c\udf31 (@solanamobile) December 16, 2023\n\nHowever, following the sell-out, Solana Mobile faced challenges. An inventory management issue with their third-party distributor led to an overestimation of available devices, resulting in unfulfillable orders and subsequent cancellations for suspicious activities. Affected customers were promised refunds, but this did little to alleviate the disappointment and confusion in the community.\n\nLast week, we saw an overwhelming demand for Saga, with sellouts in both the US & EU on our limited inventory of 20,000 devices produced globally.\n\n\n\nIn working to fulfill orders, we learned of an inventory management issue with our third-party distributor that resulted in an\u2026 \u2014 Solana Mobile \ud83c\udf31 (@solanamobile) December 22, 2023\n\nMKBHD\u2019s recent thread on X about the MKBHD Smartphone Awards 2023 further solidified the Saga\u2019s controversial status. He labeled the Saga as the \u201cBust of the Year,\u201d criticizing its underwhelming camera, display, and battery. He argued that its appeal is limited to Solana enthusiasts, overshadowing its high-quality build.\n\nIn contrast, other smartphones received more favorable recognition. The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra was named the \u201cBest Big Phone,\u201d while the Asus Zenfone 10 took the title of \u201cBest Compact Phone.\u201d The iPhone 15 Pro won for the best camera, and the Samsung Galaxy A54 was celebrated for its value. The iPhone 15 Plus received the Battery Award, the Honor Magic V2 was lauded for its design, and the OnePlus Open was recognized as the best foldable. The \u201cMost Improved\u201d award went to the Nothing Phone 2, and the \u201cPhone of the Year\u201d award went to the Google Pixel 8.\n\nFeatured Image via MKBHD\u2019s YouTube Channel"
