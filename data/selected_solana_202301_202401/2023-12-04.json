        "content": "BONK BONK/USD, the dog-themed meme coin on the Solana SOL/USD network, reached a new all-time high of $0.0000066 on Monday.\n\nWhat Happened: At the time of writing, BONK was trading an impressive $0.0000061, representing a 24-hour increase of 12%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD were up 2-4% each.\n\nIn the last 30 days, BONK witnessed a 750% increase. This growth can be attributed to the heightened investor interest in Solana, the blockchain platform underpinning BONK\u2019s operations.\n\nThe surge also comes as KuCoin, a crypto exchange, also listed BONK via the BONK/USDT trading pair. In the last 24 hours, BONK's trading volume has jumped over 270% reaching $182 million.\n\nParallel to BONK\u2019s success, Solana has ascended to become the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. SOL is still recovering from its fall from an all-time high of nearly $260 recorded in late 2021\u2014a peak period for cryptocurrencies, including frontrunners Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD. Even with its tumble to a low near $8 in late 2022, SOL has since made a comeback.\n\nSee More: Dogecoin HODLERs Are Beating Shiba Inu With 57% Landing In Profits, IntoTheBlock Data Reveals\n\nWhy It Matters: Meme coins are typically born from internet memes or humorous concepts. However, certain meme coins, such as Dogecoin and its competitor Shiba Inu, have secured their spots as the 10th and 19th largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively.\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe stories that matter on money and politics in the race for the White House\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nSome cryptocurrency funds run by the world\u2019s largest crypto manager are trading at as much as eight times their underlying value amid an unprecedented buying frenzy.\n\nThe sharp price gains are the latest sign of the passing of the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d. The price of bitcoin has jumped to a 20-month high of $42,000 amid expectation of the imminent launch of US exchange traded funds directly tracking the world\u2019s largest digital token.\n\nThe mania has spread to a host of private trusts operated by Grayscale. The company\u2019s Filecoin Trust is trading at $34.25, 721 per cent above its net asset value of $4.17, having hit a premium of more than 1,000 per cent in November.\n\nIts trust tracking solana, the third-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and ether, is at a premium of 302 per cent, while those investing in chainlink, livepeer, lumens and Decentraland\u2019s mana token are priced at between twice and four times their NAV.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd. I feel the investor doesn\u2019t really understand what they are getting into,\u201d said Bradley Duke, chief strategist of ETC Group, which runs more than $1bn in European-listed crypto exchange traded products.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what [investors] could be thinking buying at these prices,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America, at Morningstar. \u201cA lack of understanding can easily be part of it.\u201d\n\nThe funds can only be traded via OTC Markets Group, formerly known as the \u201cpink sheets\u201d market, where over-the-counter secondary trading in pre-existing shares takes place. Shares cannot be redeemed, while new shares can only be created if Grayscale carries out a private placement exercise, meaning there is no arbitrage mechanism to bring prices back in line with the underlying holdings.\n\nHowever, most of the premiums only emerged, or widened sharply, in November, coinciding with a rally in the price of many cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThere is a very strong appetite for crypto products at the moment as the crypto winter has melted. Investors are allocating to crypto in larger allocations and also diversifying from bitcoin and ethereum,\u201d said Michael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale.\n\nHe believed some investors may be willing to pay well over the odds for Grayscale\u2019s trusts in order to access cryptocurrencies \u201cthrough a product wrapper that is known to them, is familiar and gives them added protections that they are used to seeing when they invest in any other asset\u201d. The alternative is to trade via an unregulated crypto exchange.\n\nFor many of these tokens, Grayscale\u2019s funds are the only regulated products available to US retail investors.\n\n\u201cBecause there are so few regulated products out there, the investors who don\u2019t want to, or can\u2019t, invest directly in these assets have little choice,\u201d said Duke. \u201cAs a result, these products end up trading at these huge premiums. It\u2019s a function of the structure of the products.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s down to accessibility,\u201d said Armour, although he added that cryptocurrencies \u201chave such high volatility it might be [that investors] don\u2019t even care\u201d at what price they are buying.\n\nAnother contributory factor may be limited liquidity, given the small size of some of the trusts. The Filecoin Trust has assets of just $464,000 and the solana vehicle, the largest currently trading at a significant premium, at $10.8mn.\n\n\u201cThese are fairly illiquid products and, as solana spot has seen, these illiquid products are seen as proxies by those who can\u2019t buy solana directly in their funds or prefer not to,\u201d said Gautam Chhugani, senior analyst, global digital assets at AB Bernstein.\n\nDuke argued that the large departures from net asset value showed the benefit of the European model. According to this, in contrast, scores of exchange traded products that invest directly in a rich array of cryptocurrencies \u2014 including those operated by ETC Group \u2014 \u201ctrack the underlying almost perfectly\u201d.\n\nThey are analogous to ETFs in the US but need to call themselves ETPs because they fail to meet European Ucits regulations on portfolio diversification.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has so far not permitted any such \u201cspot\u201d cryptocurrency ETFs in the US. Instead it only allows ETFs that invest in the futures market. Expectation is widespread that BlackRock and rival operators will be given the green light early next year.\n\n\u201cWithout regulated products these kinds of [price] anomalies are likely to exist,\u201d Duke said. \u201cI think we are very lucky in Europe . . . the ETP wrapper is far more efficient with the ETPs trading at or very close to NAV.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the US private trust structure \u201cis problematic. And Grayscale recognise it\u2019s problematic,\u201d he added.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\nGrayscale has fought a long battle with the SEC to allow it to convert its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), at $24.1bn the world\u2019s largest bitcoin fund, into an ETF. In August, a federal appeals court in Washington DC ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale\u2019s application to convert GBTC.\n\nAlthough this trust still trades at a discount to NAV, this discount has narrowed to a 28-month low of 8.7 per cent \u2014 from a nadir of almost 50 per cent in December 2022 \u2014 in anticipation of the likelihood of Grayscale being given the go-ahead to convert it into an ETF.\n\nThe company has also filed with the SEC to transform its $6.2bn Ethereum Trust (ETHE), again the largest such vehicle in the world, into an ETF. This trades at a discount of 14.6 per cent, a far cry from the near-60 per cent level seen at the turn of the year.\n\nSonnenshein said that, in the fullness of time, he would like to see the rest of Grayscale\u2019s 17-strong product suite follow suit. \u201cThe goal would be to uplift all these products to ETFs,\u201d he said."
