        "title": "Solana (SOL) Price Rally Continues as TVL Soars to Levels Not Seen Since 2021 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSolana\u2019s Growth: Solana\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) surges to $465 million, a significant increase from $300 million in early October, indicating strong growth in its DeFi sector.\n\nSOL Price Surge: The SOL token price jumps over 114%, from $21 to over $45, showing substantial market appreciation but still remains 80% below its all-time high of $260.\n\nCommunity Resilience: Despite concerns over FTX token sales, Solana shows a robust 300% growth this year, underscoring the importance of community support in crypto ecosystems.\n\nMany coins and tokens in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector are blowing up while their respective networks and projects see the value locked in them explode in growth. Solana has had both, as its Total Value Locked (TVL) and SOL\u2019s price reached a new ATH this Thursday.\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, the TVL of Solana ecosystem projects has surged to $465 million \u2014a substantial increase from $300 million in early October.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Solana\u2019s TVL of $465 million is a significant milestone. However, it still has room for expansion, considering the current TVL value is just a fraction of its all-time high in November 2021, when it peaked at approximately $10B.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nAs the graph above shows, Solana\u2019s TVL plateaued throughout 2023, breaking the $300M barrier in July. In late October, the network\u2019s TVL skyrocketed explosively, reaching $400 by early November.\n\nThis explosive growth can be attributed to several factors, including over $74 million in institutional investment inflows \u2014with Coinbase being one of the net buyers of the crypto asset\u2014 and a surge in network activity as the top protocols hit positive monthly changes. Two of the largest growing categories in Solana are liquid staking and DEXs, as shown below.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nMeanwhile, the SOL token has also seen tremendous price appreciation in the last few weeks. The coin went from $21 in mid-October to north of $45 this week \u2014a 114.2% increase. However, despite being the most popular altcoin this year, the token remains 80% below its all-time high of nearly $260 from November 2021, which suggests there\u2019s still room for growth in the next bull run.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nSolana has had a tremendous performance in the 30 days despite the ongoing concern of FTX selling a large amount of FTX tokens. This suggests the community has moved beyond the FTX overhang and has gained over 300% this year. This goes back to the importance of communities in crypto ecosystems over a project\u2019s fundamentals and market cycles."

        "title": "Why Solana, Chainlink, and Cronos Jumped This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto market was on fire this week.\n\nThe crypto industry came to life this week as investors poured into everything from the biggest token to the smallest. But there were some notable movers for the week.\n\nAccording to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Solana (SOL 1.41%) is up 38.6% in the past week as of 3 p.m. ET Friday, Chainlink (LINK 1.30%) has jumped 36.8%, and Cronos (CRO 0.67%) is up 37.6%.\n\nBehind the pop in crypto this week\n\nThe biggest news in crypto is BlackRock saying it wants to launch an Ethereum ETF. That's leading to speculation that smaller tokens like Solana or Chainlink could eventually get their own ETFs.\n\nWhile you can own any cryptocurrency outside of an ETF, many investors see ETFs as the cheapest and easiest way to own assets, and one theory is that more ETFs will lead to more money coming into the industry.\n\nDevelopment on Solana has been some of the most notable despite the bear market and the drop in value related to FTX's collapse. Companies like Shopify and Visa are now building products and payment systems on Solana.\n\nChainlink is seeing developments like a project with Vodafone earlier this year. Cronos would like to join that development cycle, having announced a $100 million accelerator program in September.\n\nThe hype cycle of crypto died down over the past few years, but the momentum appears to be back, and it's a virtuous cycle when it gets going. Higher values attract more attention, which leads to higher values, and that's what's going on at the moment. It's not clear yet if this trend will last, but bringing more investors into the space and having more economic activity on the blockchain could only be a good thing for valuations.\n\nMore answers are needed\n\nThe moves this week are driven by volatility and hype, so there may not be a lot of staying power if the market turns south.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in the next few months will be answers to regulatory questions like when ETFs will be allowed, and when the Securities and Exchange Commission or U.S. Congress will outline clear rules for trading and development on the blockchain. If those two things get answered, we could see more investment in businesses building and innovating on the blockchain.\n\nI do think Solana and Chainlink are two of the leaders when it comes to utility blockchains, so if companies start using these products, these tokens could be winners.\n\nInvestors considering cryptocurrencies today should be aware that volatility is going to be high for tokens, and there's still regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. We have seen both the positives and the negatives of that volatility in the past three years, and while that's working for investors right now, that could flip very quickly."

        "content": "The Solana Beach School District is beginning the process to start serving the district\u2019s youngest learners, aiming to craft its own transitional kindergarten program tailored to the needs of local district students.\n\nTransitional kindergarten (TK) refers to a program that uses a modified kindergarten curriculum that is developmentally and age-appropriate. By 2025-26, Universal TK in California is expected to be fully phased in for all 4-year-old children statewide at no cost to families, in districts that receive funding through the Local Control Funding Formula.\n\nAs a community-funded basic aid school district supported by property taxes, Solana Beach does not receive state funding for TK. Of the 133 districts that are TK-eligible in the state, eight don\u2019t offer TK and five are in San Diego County including Del Mar, Rancho Santa Fe, Encinitas and Cardiff.\n\nSBSD Superintendent Jodee Brentlinger said that while they are not required to implement Universal TK, there is nothing precluding them from looking at a locally-created TK program.\n\n\u201cThis school board regularly demonstrates their commitment to the success of each and every student,\u201d Brentlinger said at the board\u2019s Nov. 8 meeting. \u201cWe recognize that we do have students across the district\u2019s schools who would accelerate their learning by having an opportunity to experience a locally-developed district program.\u201d\n\nKim Pinkerton, executive director of special education programs and services, said a steering committee will begin exploring a two-year TK/kindergarten program that could be implemented in the 2024-25 school year.\n\nThe steering committee will work to identify facilities (likely up to three classrooms at district schools), student eligibility, program needs and a funding mechanism, as well as gathering public input. The committee will work toward presenting an update to the board in January and providing a recommendation for board approval in February.\n\nWith a locally-created program, Brentlinger said they will have flexibility in class sizes, staffing, rolling date ages and the structure of the instructional day.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is look at the needs of our students and what is the best programmatic recommendation,\u201d she said. There will be a focus on developing the program from an \u201cequity lens\u201d\u2014to help break down barriers to ensure every student receives what they need to reach high expectations, such as getting English language learners prepped for kindergarten.\n\n\u201cThere are students who could truly benefit from this,\u201d said board President Debra Schade. \u201cI wish our governor would stop saying \u2018Universal TK\u2019 because it\u2019s not universal, not everybody gets money for it. But I do believe this is a very creative and front-forward thinking about how we still serve the need and ultimately benefit a child\u2019s trajectory all the way through.\u201d\n\n"

        "content": "Parent volunteer Katie S\u00fcel has been appointed as the newest trustee on the Solana Beach School District board, filling the vacancy left by Vicki King who resigned after 17 years of service. S\u00fcel currently serves as the president of the Solana Beach Schools Education Foundation and has been a substitute teacher in many district classrooms.\n\nNewly appointed Solana Beach School District trustee Katie S\u00fcel. (Solana Beach Schools Education Foundation)\n\nThe board had only one candidate apply for the Area 3 seat, which represents Carmel Valley and portions of Rancho Santa Fe. S\u00fcel will take the official oath of office before the board\u2019s Dec. 5 special board meeting and get to work right away as the board continues its search for the next superintendent. She will take a ceremonial oath at the board\u2019s regular Dec. 14 meeting.\n\nAs King was only one year into a new four-year term, S\u00fcel will serve until the November 2024 election. At that time, she could choose to run for a shortened two-year term through 2026.\n\n\u201cI want to be voice for each and every student in the district and an advocate for public education,\u201d S\u00fcel said during her interview with the board on Nov. 9. \u201cPublic education is a vital right, not only for the individual student but our society as a whole.\u201d\n\nA Carmel Valley resident for 10 years, S\u00fcel and her family moved to the community for the schools and her children have thrived in the Solana Beach district\u2014her son is a fourth grader at Solana Highlands Elementary and her daughter is now in seventh grade.\n\nTeacher Neva Ayn Megalnick said S\u00fcel got involved in the Solana Highlands PTA right away, volunteering in her STREAM lab: \u201cHer approach with the students, her ability to find joy in the work we were doing and to just dive in was wonderful,\u201d said Magalnick, who noted S\u00fcel also advocated for getting female astronaut LEGOs to join the male crew in the lab\u2019s collection.\n\nS\u00fcel has a PhD in molecular biology but stepped away from her career 10 years ago to care for her children.\n\n\u201cWhile I was thinking about returning to work, Superintendent Jodee Brentlinger mentioned that the district was in desperate need for substitute teachers,\u201d S\u00fcel said. \u201cSince I enjoyed the many hours I spent volunteering at my children\u2019s schools, applying to substitute teach felt like a natural next step in re-entering the workforce.\u201d\n\nShe got her 30-day credential in spring 2021 and in the 2021-22 school year, she completely set up and taught Solana Highlands\u2019 art discovery lab for 10 weeks, deepening her commitment to the school and getting to know all the kids.\n\n\u201cWhen they see me they say \u2018You\u2019re our old art teacher!\u2019 and I say \u2019No, I\u2019m your former art teacher!\u2019\u201d\n\nS\u00fcel has volunteered for the Solana Beach Education Foundation for five years and is in her second year as president of the board, helping to raise funds to enhance students\u2019 educational experience and building connections with parent leaders from across the district.\n\nMegalnick said S\u00fcel\u2019s \u201clayers of perspective\u201d in viewing the district as a parent, teacher and foundation member will be beneficial for the board.\n\n\u201cI genuinely really love this district and I care about the wellbeing of each and every child and that is what drives my desire to serve on this board,\u201d S\u00fcel said.\n\nAt the Nov. 9 meeting, the board interviewed Suel in public. While she was the only candidate, Vice President Dana King said it was still the board\u2019s responsibility to make sure she was the very best candidate.\n\n\u201cWe have a very qualified candidate \u2026there\u2019s a very clear philosophy that I think is consistent with what we\u2019ve had, which is that it\u2019s all about the kids,\u201d King said.\n\nSBSD President Debra Schade said S\u00fcel\u2019s application was a \u201cslam dunk\u201d and showed a strong desire to serve at this level. She also said it was also exciting to have a member join the board who will have students in the district again.\n\nKing honored at last board meeting\n\nAt the board\u2019s regular meeting the day before on Nov. 8, the district paid tribute to the departing Vicki King. After a slide show of 17 years worth of students and smiles, the big screen showed a word cloud, a collection of King\u2019s best characteristics and qualities: intelligent, warm, caring, poised, student-centered, thoughtful, curious and dedicated.\n\nKing was presented with a plaque to recognize her years of service and fellow board members spoke about how she was a valuable mentor and a thoughtful leader.\n\n\u201cYour absence will be felt and we will miss you in that seat and your legacy will certainly endure for our school district,\u201d Schade said.\n\nKing, an attorney, small business owner and executive coach, was first elected to the board in 2006 and last fall ran unopposed for her fifth term. Her two children attended Carmel Creek and Solana Pacific and before joining the board, she got her start in the district taking leadership roles on the PTA and site council.\n\n\u201cShe entered this role 17 years ago with a desire fueled by passion to give all students the very best full-child educational experience possible,\u201d Superintendent Jodee Brentlinger said.\n\nDuring her tenure, King was a strong advocate for the nutrition program, for each school to have its own self-sufficient kitchen to prepare scratch-made meals. Her term saw the building of the new Solana Ranch School, passing the Measure JJ general obligation bond to modernize all campuses, and she was involved in the hiring of three superintendents. She served as board president during the pandemic, leading the district as they worked to re-open schools.\n\n\u201cBeing a board member is not easy...there are many demands which have only magnified over the last three to five years,\u201d Brentlinger said. \u201cBut through all of my interactions with Ms. King, she has never lost sight of the students.\u201d\n\nKing has said it was a difficult decision to step away\u2014she will be pursuing a new position as an education consultant. She said she was emotional thinking about what to say on her last day after 17 years and grew tearful thanking her supportive husband Marty and \u201cthe most professional high performing team\u201d she has ever worked with.\n\n\u201cIt has really been the honor of a lifetime to be a part of this board, this district and this community,\u201d King said. \u201cI just hope that I\u2019ve given this district as much as this district has given me.\u201d\n\n"

        "title": "David's Takes: What I Learned at Solana Breakpoint - Bankless",
        "content": "Solana's Breakpoint conference has always come at a key point for the ecosystem. This year, I was there soaking it in.\n\nI just returned from my last conference of 2024. Meeting cool people and encountering new ideas in crypto takes me to some pretty interesting places all over the world, but this last tour was a little different than my typical crypto conference endeavors!\n\nFor the first time, I went to a non-Ethereum conference \ud83d\ude32\n\nI'm not talking about a generalist conference either, like Permissionless. I went to Solana Breakpoint, put on by the Solana Foundation.\n\nIt's hard to get a sense of reality these days. As someone with deep ties to the Ethereum community, my only perception of Solana is through Twitter, which is a terrible lens for viewing anything these days, especially in crypto, where tribes continually fight in the area of crypto-twitter to distort perception to their favor.\n\nSo, my Ethereum circles are left viewing Solana from the outside.\n\nIf Crypto Twitter can't provide a true reality of Solana, what is there left to do besides go to Breakpoint myself and get the vibes straight from the source?\n\nBankless Nation, here's everything I learned at Solana Breakpoint \ud83d\udc47\n\nWho is the Solana Community?\n\nMy central quest at this event was understanding the makeup of the Solana community. Who does this ecosystem attract, and why?\n\nSolana has attracted a community of engineers that Ethereum was not able to nerd-snipe. These are ex-Apple, ex-Tesla, ex-SpaceX type engineers who are familiar with the relationship between hardware and software. These are highly technical optimizers. Solana provides them the clay to work within a capacity that makes sense to them and in ways that Ethereum did not.\n\nIn fact, some of the priorities of the Ethereum community likely appear nonsensical and a waste of time to these types of engineers. This feature is likely why Chris Burniske distinguishes the Ethereum community as 'optimists' or 'ideologically motivated' and the Solana community as 'pragmatists.'\n\nTo me, it makes sense that the 'pragmatists' of crypto would find a cozy home in the space between hardware and software where crypto networks operate, while the ideologically motivated focus more exclusively on the open-source software realm, where values, governance, and identity can be codified.\n\nIf someone whose perception of the world was dominated through the lens of Crypto Twitter heard that I was going to Solana Breakpoint, they would probably grab their popcorn, thinking, \"Ooo, David's going behind enemy lines!!\" \ud83c\udf7f\n\nIn reality, the Solana community is just another crypto community. The average person here isn't thinking in tribal terms. Hackers go to both Ethereum and Solana hackathons\u2026 and then they go to StarkNet and Near and Chainlink hackathons, too. Some builders choose to stay cause they found a problem they'd like to commit to.\n\nI met the team from Marinade, a Solana staking automation platform, and I met Anoushk and Harsh, the dev-duo behind Tinydancer, a Solana light-client. Both teams expressed their appreciation for the content Bankless has been putting out over the years, with the Tinydancer duo saying it had pushed them to get into crypto in the first place.\n\nThese types of interactions at crypto conferences are always gratifying \u2013 and endlessly motivating! Every time I get back from one of these events, I immediately node-sync with Ryan about all of these interactions, because I love sharing the immense amount of positivity and good vibes that exist in the IRL context of Crypto.\n\nThis is all to say that the IRL Solana community is not that different from the IRL Ethereum community, and it's the more extreme internet leaders of both communities that define the internet-native identities of these ecosystems.\n\nWhat was the Vibe?\n\nThis was the third-ever Solana Breakpoint, the first coming at the absolute froth of the 2021 market, when SOL was drenched in the ecstasy of its $250+ pico-top, and the 2nd being the week before FTX crashed. \ud83d\ude26\n\nIt's safe to say that Solana Breakpoint has never been hosted under stable conditions, until now. In my opinion, it's the first time Solana has been able to get a true signal from the community that Breakpoint attracts since, in prior years, it was drowned out by the short-term tourists (and scammers) that Solana attracted during the bull. I wasn't at the first two Breakpoints, so I'm shooting from the hip a bit here. These are takes I've generated after talking to those who did go to these Breakpoints.\n\nCongrats to @SolanaConf for being the only conference that caused a pump instead of a dump \u2014 \ud83e\ude78DavidHoffman.eth\ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@TrustlessState) November 1, 2023\n\nThe vibe of Solana Breakpoint had notes that I was well familiar with from my early days in Ethereum, but with some unique flavorings as well.\n\nFirst, there was a pretty clear sense that the Solana community feels like they're sitting on gold. They know that they've got something that the world will one day want, and that sense of \"pre-rich conviction\" was definitely present. I wouldn't say this vibe was ubiquitous\u2026 it was definitely expressed by a minority. The rest of the conference attendees were more indifferent to that aspect, but it was present nonetheless. This vibe naturally brought a nascent sense of optimism and excitement, which I definitely remember feeling during the novelty of my early Ethereum days, especially during my early years at ETH Denver 2018 and 2019.\n\nSolana & Ethereum\n\nThe content featured on the mainstage was all about \ud83d\udc4f scaling \ud83d\udc4f scaling \ud83d\udc4f scaling \ud83d\udc4f. If there's one bit of Solana Breakpoint content to consume to catch the vibe, it's the 90min opening presentation by various Solana leaders. (It was hosted on Halloween, hence Anatoly is in a green dragon costume)\n\nIt was pretty funny to hear direct jabs at Ethereum during the keynote presentation. Jokes about \"not needing any layers\" and \"Ethereum alignment\" are actually a pretty core part of the Solana DNA at this point. Here, Crypto Twitter has clearly bled into Solana culture, and it's the part that I find least resonant.\n\nSolana's identity has largely been shaped by having to survive post-FTX collapse, all while the Ethereum community twists the knife over the rampant extraction culture in the Solana app-layer and the claimed incoherence of the monolithic scaling strategy. The Ethereum community was not nice to Solana in the time in which Solana was down bad the most.\n\nAnd it was at this moment when the Solana community grit its teeth, dug in, chewed glass, and dug itself out of the narrative shithole it found itself in. The narrative around Solana was so bad that it became existential.\n\nVCs stopped funding Solana-based projects just because they were building on Solana. $SOL market cap was at $4B, less than half of the 2018-2019 $ETH market cap bottom of $10, during which Ethereum also was faced with existential concerns about its ability to fund itself.\n\nI'm pretty sure that this is when Solana leadership took a direct, hands-on approach to fixing the Solana narrative before it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. This was when the Mert reply-guy ratio army started to kick in, and when you would find Anatoly replying to every single tweet about Solana, good or bad. This was when Solana started developing narratives and memes that could revitalize the community around it.\n\nAnd to their credit, it totally worked. The narrative around Solana has found new meaning, new heights, and an insane level of engagement on Twitter. And to our fault, by attempting to \"finish off\" Solana by conflating it with FTX as much as possible, the Ethereum community held a large role in creating the negative environment that Solana had to rebuild itself in.\n\nNow, Solana has emerged from the bear market, still intact. The entire Solana project now understands Ethereum to be no friend of it, and as a result, we find jabs and shade thrown at Ethereum on the mainstage of Solana's annual conference.\n\nI'm likely focusing too much on this! But, the collective psychology of crypto tribes is one of the things that fascinates me most about this industry, and while I often find myself playing tribal games just like everyone else, it's always a reminder of how we can all be better, even if our L1s are fundamentally in direct competition with each other.\n\nWhat is Solana excited about?\n\nThere was plenty of excitement around rebirth and being early, but on a technical level, the one thing that nearly every attendee at Breakpoint seemed most jazzed about was Firedancer.\n\nFiredancer is a new Solana client built by the Jump Crypto team. The original Solana client, built by the Solana Foundation, is overloaded with tech debt and isn't optimized. The Firedancer client is promised to bring massive improvements to Solana network performance.\n\nThe Firedancer client can be considered as a big network upgrade to Solana, a Solana 2.0 if you will. It's akin to the Ethereum excitement around something like EIP1559 or the Merge, except it's focused on performance.\n\nThe Firedancer testnet was announced at Breakpoint, much to the excitement of the entire community. Exploring what this all means for Solana and validator economics is something a bit outside of my knowledge and is perhaps something we will explore on Bankless in the future. \ud83d\udc40\n\nFiredancer also unlocks a critical property of Solana, which is becoming a multi-client network. Single-client networks are fragile and prone to downtime. With Firedancer, Solana gets a second client, meaningfully increasing its robustness.\n\nGranted, having a network that is one part Firedancer and one part the older Solana client from the Foundation is not going to work since the whole network will be bottlenecked by the older client, but in my conversations with Austin, he said the suggested architecture is that Firedancer client operators run the older Solana client as a fallback, with Firedancer as the primary. Apparently, this gets you the best of both worlds, which is neat.\n\nAnother thing that caught my eye is Solana's Token22 software package. Token22 is a token software enhancement package that brings a ton of additional functionality to Solana tokens, including custom permissions and confidential transactions, aka privacy.\n\nFor further rabbit holes on what is exciting the Solana community, listen to the latter half of my conversation with Austin and Anatoly at Breakpoint!\n\nSo, am I bullish Solana?\n\nSolana has certainly captured more of my attention lately. So, what's the deal? Is Bankless finally bullish Solana? Or is David's attention being truly captured by the Solana community engagement-attacking him inside of the arena of Twitter narrative warfare campaigns? Is it something else?\n\nTo be honest, I don't have an answer here. Chris Burniske recently attempted to try and shoehorn me into either bullish or bearish SOL on Twitter, which I felt frustrated by.\n\nHow I intend to engage with the Solana community, I will let the future decide. I do know that I vibe with the Ethereum community at a very deep level, and that part of that Ethereum community spirit still feels meaningfully absent in the Solana community.\n\nIt was disheartening to see a fully packed room during a panel conversation on Solana validator economics, and then when the next panel came on to discuss the future of Solana community governance, the completely full room emptied out.\n\nAnd then @TrustlessState being one of the few of us left in the audience. \ud83d\ude05 The irony was overwhelming. \ud83e\udd72 \u2014 ZenLlama \ud83e\uddec (@zen_llama) November 5, 2023\n\nPutting on my Solana-bear hat, this is the obvious outcome of a network which went-to-mark by compromising on decentralization in the hopes of decentralizing the network over time. This attracted a certain community that does not value decentralization as much as the rest of the industry, and the supply of community attention towards efforts like community ownership and decentralization is reflected as such.\n\nOr maybe these conversations are just getting started, and I'm selling this part of Solana short \u2013 time will tell!\n\nFor now, that's everything I learned at Solana Breakpoint!"
