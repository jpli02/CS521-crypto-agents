        "content": "Solana on April 6 announced the introduction of state compression, a new feature that will significantly reduce the cost of minting NFTs.\n\nAccording to Solana, state compression can be used to store any type of on-chain data, but is typically used with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at present.\n\nThe approach involves modifying an existing Merkle tree on the Solana blockchain instead of carrying out a standard transaction, allowing for \u201cdrastically cheaper\u201d NFTs.\n\nThe cost of minting and storing compressed NFTs scales with the number of items in question. In one estimate, Solana said that it costs 5.35 SOL ($113) to mint and store one million compressed NFTs. By comparison, it would cost 12,000 SOL ($253,680) to mint the same amount of NFTs on Solana without the benefits of state compression.\n\nSolana also said that it costs just 0.000005 SOL (less than one cent) to mint a single compressed NFT. A complete price scale is shown in the project\u2019s blog post.\n\nSolana said that at least five projects are already using the feature.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "If a black cat could work anywhere, where would it work? Of course, we know cats don't work, but if we had to take a guess, I would say that Hot Topic would be perfect for black cats! At least, that's how it happened to one particularly mischievous kitty in El Paso.\n\nThis is Soot Sprite, named after the pitch-black and fuzzy-haired beings straight out of a Studio Ghibli movie, and she's quite the character.\n\nSoot Sprite is the resident cat at Sun City Kitty, El Paso's first and only cat caf\u00e9 located inside Sunland Park Mall.\n\nSprite is there to help the other kitties get acquainted with the space and, most importantly, she's there to welcome everyone to the kitty caf\u00e9. But, recently, Sprite has been getting into some hijinks.\n\nEnter your number to get our free mobile app\n\nIt all started when the workers at Sun City Kitty discovered, to their horror, that Sprite could get out of the gate and wander about the mall on her own! One morning, they found her atop the Hot Topic sign.\n\nBecause of this incident, procedures had to be put in place to avoid a repeat of Sprite's jailbreak!\n\nThe employees of Sun City Kitty were concerned for her safety, but they also didn't want to restrict her of going on adventures, so- Sprite got her very own chauffer.\n\nWith her outgoing and can-do attitude, the employees of Hot Topic decided that Soot Sprite would make the purrfect sales associate, and in turn made her an honorary employee! Because, where else would a black cat work?\n\nSprite got her very own work badge, and while she won't be on the prowl anymore, she most certainly fits the Hot Topic aesthetic, where I'm sure she's welcome anytime! Good job, Soot Sprite!\n\nYou can find out more about Sun City Kitty, including how to apply to adopt, here."
