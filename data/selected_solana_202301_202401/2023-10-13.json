        "content": "The Solana Foundation is offering a reward of $400,000 for anyone who can discover the code that could potentially \u201cturn off Solana.\u201d\n\nThis development comes while SOL\u2019s price has dipped by 8.4% in the past week following several mentions in Sam-Bankman Friend\u2019s trial.\n\nJacob Creech Announces $400,000 Bounty\n\nJacob Creech, the Head of Developer Relations for the foundation, recently took to X to announce a $400,000 bounty for anyone who can discover the code that could turn Solana off.\n\nFyi there\u2019s a $400k reward for anyone that can find code that can turn off Solana Please go ahead and find ithttps://t.co/2oxcB0EEyx \u2014 Jacob Creech (@jacobvcreech) October 12, 2023\n\nThis offer is a part of the Solana Foundation\u2019s broader security bug bounty program, which actively encourages white hat hackers to scrutinize the blockchain for vulnerabilities, with various rewards up for grabs.\n\nAmong these bounties is $2 million in locked SOL tokens, set aside for a 12-month lockup period, awaiting those who can uncover vulnerabilities such as theft of funds without user signatures, unauthorized fund transfers, or vote program exploits that drain delegated stakes.\n\nOne standout bounty worth $1 million is reserved for those who can expose the Solana network\u2019s consensus violations or safety issues. This includes the recently publicized $400,000 reward, which incentivizes hackers to identify vulnerabilities that could lead to remote attacks capable of partitioning the Solana network.\n\nAs a blockchain hailed as an \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d Solana acknowledges that no network is immune to vulnerabilities and is determined to address these issues proactively.\n\nSOL\u2019s Decline Tied to Bankman-Fried Trial Mentions\n\nMeanwhile, Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal trial has caused a negative impact on SOL, which is the eighth-largest cryptocurrency. SOL\u2019s performance has been poor recently, with its current price at $21.36, down by 8.4% in the past week, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThis decline may be linked to its frequent mentions in Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial, in which his lawyer, Mark S. Cohen, discussed his interest in this cryptocurrency during the trial.\n\nSOL serves as the currency for transactions on the Solana blockchain, which developers use to create decentralized apps like DeFi lending platforms. Additionally, it was favored by FTX, with its former CEO Bankman-Fried supporting Solana, launching a Solana NFT marketplace, and investing in various native projects."

        "content": "A fake post claimed that Alameda Research could turn Solana \u201con and off\u201d to liquidate longs.\n\nSolana Foundation head of developer relations Jacob Creech said there was a $400,000 bounty for \u201canyone that can find code that can turn off Solana.\u201d\n\nThe explosive testimony of Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison this past week did more than make things extremely difficult for the defence of her ex-boyfriend Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nIt also gave rise to numerous memes, including a fake Ellison quote claiming Alameda could turn Solana \u201con and off\u201d to affect long positions \u2014 bullish bets on the direction of Solana\u2019s native currency, SOL. The fake post was shared over X, formerly Twitter, and spread like wildfire.\n\n\u201cGeesh, as the leader of the Solana Soldiers, this hurts my heart,\u201d disgraced crypto influencer Ben Armstrong tweeted, asking if the quotes were legitimate.\n\n\u201cImagine building on top of this garbage,\u201d Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow added, reposting the fake post.\n\nIf the fake post was able to gain traction, it\u2019s because of the close relationship Solana and Bankman-Fried used to have.\n\nFTX overhang\n\nAt its peak, \u201cSam\u2019s [SOL] stash was worth maybe $12 billion,\u201d writes Michael Lewis in his new book, \u201cGoing Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Lewis writes that Bankman-Fried owned anywhere between 10% and 15% of the entire SOL supply through Alameda and FTX. Solana ecosystem tokens became casually known as \u201cSam coins\u201d in the crypto space.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons crypto investors panicked when in September the FTX bankruptcy team obtained court approval to liquidate $3.4 billion worth of crypto assets \u2014 including over $1 billion in SOL tokens.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut Bankman-Fried\u2019s downfall didn\u2019t spell the end for Solana development.\n\n\u201cNone of the builders I know viewed FTX as an existential catastrophe,\u201d Rooter, the pseudonymous co-founder of lending protocol Solend, told DL News in August. \u201cAll of the fundamentals that brought us here \u2014 cheap fees, fast transactions, a strong ecosystem \u2014 were still there.\n\n\u201cJust lost a very good exchange with Solana support, but there were others,\u201d they said.\n\n$400,000 bug bounty\n\nThe fake Ellison post also referenced an issue that has recurrently plagued Solana \u2014 system shutdowns. It also suggested a potential vulnerability within the network, a claim that could have serious implications if true.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a $400,000 reward for anyone that can find code that can turn off Solana,\u201d wrote Solana Foundation head of developer relations Jacob Creech on Thursday in response to the fake Ellison post. \u201cPlease go ahead and find it.\u201d\n\nThe reward was launched last month \u2014 alongside bounties for potential consensus violations or potential loss of funds \u2014 to encourage hackers to report network vulnerabilities to the Solana development team.\n\nThe bug bounty would be awarded for demonstrations of instances where the consensus comes to a halt and requires human intervention, according to the description. Additionally, vulnerabilities pertaining to eclipse attacks and remote attacks that result in network partitioning are also eligible for the reward.\n\nThe bounty fee would be paid in Solana\u2019s native token SOL and would be locked for a year.\n\nSolana hasn\u2019t experienced any outages since February \u2014 its longest period of uninterrupted uptime since March 2021.\n\nThe company behind Solana has attributed the improved performance to a series of upgrades meant to address its outage problem, including Ethereum-like fee markets that allow users to pay higher transaction fees in exchange for priority in the transaction queue.\n\nEkin Gen\u00e7 is the managing editor of DL News.

        "content": "The Arendsen Braddock personal injury law firm, which launched in 2016, has been making inroads in the community since moving into its new building on the 101 in Solana Beach \u2013 now the firm\u2019s main headquarters.\n\nJoshua Braddock, a founding partner of Arendsen Braddock\n\n(Hannah Claire Photography(@hannah_claire_photography)\n\nThe firm specializes in handling cases involving bicycle and e-bike collisions along the north coastal corridor, which passes right by the front of their 101 offices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always handled bicycle accidents, but recently there has been a higher occurrence of them since e-bikes have come onto the scene,\u201d said Joshua Braddock, an Encinitas resident and founding partner of the law firm who has focused on personal injury throughout his career.\n\nTraffic safety has been a top priority for local leaders in San Diego\u2019s north coastal communities, spurred by the rise in e-bike usage over the past several years. The cities of Carlsbad and Encinitas declared local emergencies over the last year after they each experienced a tragic collision that resulted in the death of an e-biker.\n\nThe Solana Beach City Council has also been discussing the parameters of a citywide ordinance aimed at improving safety for riders on bicycles and e-bikes, as well as other road users.\n\nThe San Diego County Sheriff has also made e-bike enforcement a focal point, especially for the safety of children riding e-bikes to and from school.\n\n\u201cWe feel really drawn to this part of the community,\u201d said Braddock, who lives in Encinitas with his wife Hannah and their two daughters Maggie, 4, and Hazel, 2. \u201cWe feel like this is a part of our community where we, ourselves being cyclists and e-bike commuters, can really provide perspective and value right now.\u201d\n\nThe team at Arendsen Braddock Personal Injury provides clients with a thorough handling of their cases from injury to resolution. They not only deal with the complicated insurance claims process helping to maximize available resources to provide care and support to the injured party, but can also help their clients find care when there is no insurance available or resources to pay for expensive doctor\u2019s appointments and medical procedures.\n\n\u201cBicycle accidents, especially e-bike accidents, can be somewhat nuanced, and there are sometimes just questions of wrong and right that aren\u2019t easy to answer. We\u2019re able to come in and help answer those questions, and we do so by maintaining a team of experienced attorneys, investigators and accident reconstruction experts that we bring whenever we come onto a case.\u201d\n\nWith two daughters ages 4 and 2, Braddock also said it\u2019s important to advocate for safety measures. \u201cAt the end of the day, I think every parent\u2019s purpose in life is to be doing everything we can to make sure our kids come home safe at the end of each day.\u201d\n\nA new state law led to the recent creation of an e-bike safety program. Another proposed law that could be approved next year, AB 530, would create a licensing system that requires e-bike riders to take an online written test and have a state-issued identification. It would also ban children under age 12 from riding e-bikes.\n\n\u201cChildren don\u2019t know all the dangers they need to be aware of, it\u2019s just entirely a matter of exposure and experience,\u201d Braddock said. \u201cIn the early stages of riding, they don\u2019t have enough situational experience to know what dangers to be on the lookout for and can oftentimes think that someone else is going to be looking out for them \u2013 so it is important to supplement this lack of experience with as much training as possible.\u201d\n\nArendsen Braddock Personal Injury is located at 535 N. Highway 101, Suite A, in Solana Beach.\n\nFor more information about Arendsen Braddock Personal Injury, or to ask any questions related to bicycle safety or any other aspects of the work the firm does on personal injury, visit arendsenbraddock.com or call 760-222-7777.\n\n\u2014 Business Spotlight features enterprises that support this publication."
