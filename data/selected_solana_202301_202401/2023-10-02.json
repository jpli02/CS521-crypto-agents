Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) reached $338.82 million this Monday, marking its highest since the start of the year, as per DefiLlama data.\n\nTVL is a metric\u2013arguably a crude one\u2013for measuring how much money is sloshing around a network\u2019s various DeFi apps.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, SOL's TVL saw an increase of roughly 4.15%, jumping from $324.64 million on Sunday to $338.82 million by Monday. Pushing that rise, are popular Solana-based projects like Drift, marginfi, Solend, and others.\n\nThe network\u2019s native SOL token has also reported its strongest week since mid-July. The token experienced a 29% rise over the past week and has surged 39.08% from its September low, per CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSOL is trading hands at $24.42 press time, indicating a 65% jump from its 2023 lowest price.\n\nStill, these numbers remain a shadow of their peak during the bull market.\n\nSolana's TVL had skyrocketed to just above $10 billion in November 2021 before plummeting. It bottomed out at $210 million in January 2023.\n\nFTX estate and SOL liquidation\n\nThe latest recovery isn\u2019t confirmed yet, though\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConcerns arise about the possible effect on SOL's price after the FTX estate has been approved to sell its crypto holdings.\n\nThe estate is said to have about $1.2 billion in SOL. According to market analyst The Tie, of this amount, as much as 22 million SOL tokens (roughly valued at $400 million) are unlocked and can be sold.\n\nThis represents close to 4% of SOL's total supply.\n\nAnother 40 million to 44 million tokens, or approximately $860 million, are currently staked and another $17 million worth of SOL tokens are expected to be unlocked every month for the next four years.\n\nSolana was amongst the projects that were the most severely hit by the FTX collapse.\n\nThe layer.1 blockchain and Bankman-Fried\u2019s companies were heavily intertwined, as the Solana Fondation detailed in a blog post in November 2022.\n\nThe Foundation revealed it had around $1 million in cash or similar assets with FTX until November 6, 2022, before the platform halted customer withdrawals.\n\nThis represents less than 1% of its total funds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Solana Foundation owned roughly 3.24 million shares in FTX Trading LTD, as well as about 3.43 million FTT tokens and 134.54 million SRM tokens from Project Serum, a decentralized exchange on Solana launched by Bankman-Fried in 2020."

        "title": "Solana Beach school board member Vicki King resigns after 17 years - Del Mar Times",
        "content": "Vicki King will resign from the Solana Beach School District Board next month after 17 years serving the community; her last official board meeting will be on Nov 8.\n\nKing stated it was a difficult decision to step away, however, she is excited to pursue a new position as a consultant in education, with an opportunity to make an impact on students not just locally but throughout the state and the country.\n\nVicki King (Courtesy)\n\n\u201cIt has been an honor of a lifetime to work with this dedicated, student-focused board and serve the students, staff, families and community of Solana Beach School District for so many years,\u201d said King in a news release. \u201cMy family and I moved to Carmel Valley to become part of the SBSD and I am proud of the work we have accomplished together, and the work that will continue on behalf of SBSD students. I look forward to attending events and continuing to support SBSD schools as a community member.\u201d\n\nKing, who is an attorney, small business owner and executive coach and consultant, was first elected to the board in 2006. Last fall, she ran unopposed for her fifth term in Area 3, which includes portions of Carmel Valley and Rancho Santa Fe.\n\nMoving to the community for the schools, her children attended Carmel Creek and Solana Pacific where she took on leadership roles on the PTA and site council. Wanting to impact students at the district level, she decided to run for the school board: \u201cI saw the district\u2019s vision and I wanted to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nServing on the board has been something she has enjoyed so much: \u201cIt\u2019s been a tremendous experience.\u201d\n\nShe was part of the building of Solana Ranch, Skyline and Solana Vista schools, as well as the difficult decision not to build the district\u2019s eighth school in Pacific Highlands Ranch. Looking back she said it is proving to be the right decision and she is proud of the way that the board and district ensured that the community felt heard in the process and ultimately supported the district as they moved forward.\n\nDuring her tenure, King worked with four superintendents and was involved in hiring three of them, the most important job that a school board member has. She served as the board\u2019s president through the pandemic, which she said was a lot of work, dealing with making tough decisions and facing challenges with divisiveness in the community.\n\n\u201cIn the end, it just brought us together and made us stronger,\u201d King said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the work we did as an entire district.\u201d\n\nAs a board member King has always been thoughtful and intentional in the decisions she makes. She said she is grateful for the experience of being part of such a \u201chigh performing, high functioning\u201d team, from the board to the superintendent and leadership cabinet to the principals, teachers and every single staff member whom she truly believes are there to do what\u2019s best for students.\n\n\u201cIt has truly been my honor and privilege to work alongside Member King as part of SBSD\u2019s governance team,\u201d said Superintendent Jodee Brentlinger in the news release. \u201cHer legacy will continue through the dedication she has shown to the SBSD community throughout her tenure.\u201d\n\nKing will file her resignation with the San Diego County Office of Education effective Nov. 15. When a vacancy occurs, the board is required to fill the vacancy within 60 days, which in this case is by Jan. 13, 2024.\n\nAt a Sept. 28 special board meeting, the board voted to go with the provisional appointment process to fill the vacancy, rather than take on the cost of a special election. Neighboring San Dieguito\u2019s 2021 special election for Area 5 cost $187,428.\n\nSolana Beach previously used the appointment process in March 2020 to appoint Dana King, now the board\u2019s vice president.\n\nThe district is now accepting potential candidates and applications are due back by Nov. 1 at noon. The board plans to interview candidates in public on Nov. 9, with a swearing-in held the following month on Dec. 14.\n\nMuch like the Del Mar Union School District\u2019s provisional appointment earlier this year, due to the length remaining in King\u2019s term, the new trustee will serve until the next regularly scheduled general election in 2024. At that time, the appointed member could choose to run for a shortened two-year term through 2026.\n\nFor more information about the appointment process and timeline, including the application packet on the Solana Beach School District website, visit sbsd.k12.ca.us/\n\n"
