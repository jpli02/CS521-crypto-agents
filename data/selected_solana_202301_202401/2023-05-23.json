        "content": "Former Goldman Sachs executive and macro expert Raoul Pal is bullish on Solana (SOL) based on his interpretation of the technical analysis.\n\nPal says in this week\u2019s Global Macro Investor (GMI) newsletter that the Ethereum (ETH) competitor and 11th-largest crypto asset by market cap is \u201cgetting ready\u201d for an upward move.\n\nThe macro guru says that Solana has undergone consolidation after completing a pattern that indicates a reversal from a bearish to a bullish trend.\n\n\u201cSolana looks like it\u2019s getting ready to make its next move higher after a period of consolidation following the inverse head and shoulders breakout in April. Solana was a big bet at GMI this year and is up nearly 150% year-to-date\u2026\u201d\n\nSolana is trading at $19.88 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to stocks, the macro guru says that it appears that global equities are on the verge of rallying amid the formation of a bullish pattern.\n\nAccording to the macro guru, global equities could hit a new high if a key resistance level on the All Country World Index (ACWI) index is breached. The ACWI index measures the performance of large and mid-cap equities in both developed and emerging markets.\n\n\u201cGlobal equities just look like the mirror image of the DXY [US dollar index] and appear to be forming a large head-and-shoulders bottom. We\u2019re very close to a potential breakout now and the small bullish pennant that has formed on the right shoulder looks like just the boost needed to get us over the line.

        "content": "Layer 1 Blockchain Looks To Reverse Its Decline With AI Integration\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi\n\nSolana, a Layer 1 blockchain known for its fast and cheap transactions, is embracing the nascent world of artificial intelligence in a bid to reverse its long-standing downtrend and bolster adoption.\n\nOn Tuesday, Solana launched a ChatGPT plugin that lets users purchase NFTs, transfer tokens, and analyze on-chain data. The plugin can be downloaded from Github.\n\n\u201cEvery developer building consumer-oriented apps should be thinking about how their app is going to be interacted with through an AI model because this is a new paradigm for telling computers what to do,\" Anatoly Yakovenko, the CEO of Solana Labs, said in an interview. \u201cAI will make Solana more usable and understandable.\u201d\n\nYakovenko said he expects that future versions of the plugin will be able to write smart contracts and deploy them on-chain.\n\nSolana\u2019s AI offering follows an extended downtrend for the project and its broader ecosystem. The network\u2019s SOL token is up 80% this year but remains 92% below its 2021 highs.\n\nThe move comes as the rapidly growing sophistication of ChatGPT and rival large language models dominate headlines. The technology promises to significantly disrupt the labor market, unlocking new productive capabilities while leaving widespread creative destruction in its wake.\n\nBattered Ecosystem\n\nSolana was an early winner in the Layer 1 boom of 2021 that was kicked off by rising transaction fees on Ethereum.\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) on the network grew 20 times from $500M to $10B between July and November 2021, accompanied by a 600% rally in SOL. However, TVL has steadily cratered to just $266M since then, with SOL also plunging more than 92%.\n\nSolana lost sizable market share to competing low-cost Layer 1s at the end of the previous bull cycle, with critics taking shots at the network\u2019s persistent outages and poor decentralization.\n\nAlready among the web3 ecosystems hardest hit by the 2022 bear trend, Solana suffered yet another massive blow last November when FTX and Alameda Research collapsed, throwing the firms\u2019 founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, into disrepute.\n\nBankman-Fried, a long-time proponent of Solana, made large investments in many ecosystem projects through his now-insolvent trading and investment firms. Several projects have since failed due to the firms holding outsized exposure to their tokens.\n\nGrants Funding\n\nSolana also announced a ten-fold increase in funding allocated to its AI accelerator grants program to $10M on May 23.\n\nThe program aims to foster the development of machine learning models interacting with Solana-based protocols. More than 50 projects have applied for grants since the program was initially announced one month ago. The grants are valued between $5,000 and $25,000.\n\n\u201cI think what would be cool is an AI plugin that you tell, \u2018Hey, I want to do an NFT set with 10,000 images in this style with these traits\u2019, and then stable diffusion generates the whole thing, mints them on-chain, sets up a Discord group, starts answering questions, and starts building out lore and stories. I think there's a lot of interesting, weird things that could happen.\u201d Anatoly Yakovenko\n\nThe Solana ecosystem is already home to several projects utilizing AI specializing in web3.\n\nHivemapper, a decentralized mapping application that distributes tokens to users that contribute to its map using a dashcam, launched an AI tool in April that helps to convert dashcam recordings into a visual map.\n\nAlso in April, MarginFi, a decentralized trading protocol, launched Omni, a chatbot specializing in providing information on Solana and its ecosystem projects. Context also launched a Solana-focused chatbot last month."

        "content": "The Solana Foundation integrates ChatGPT and announces strategic grants and accelerator program focused on AI growth and development on Solana\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, May 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Solana Foundation, a non-profit foundation dedicated to the decentralization, adoption, and security of the Solana network, today announced the Solana blockchain has become the first Layer 1 blockchain to integrate artificial intelligence with a ChatGPT plugin developed by Solana Labs. In addition, the Solana Foundation has announced an AI accelerator program for university students and a strategic grant program to accelerate the usage and integration of AI on Solana.\n\nThe ChatGPT plugin integrated with Solana, the first for a Layer 1 blockchain, is currently available as a download from Github . This integration from Solana Labs serves as a reference for how AI can make it easier to understand Solana data and protocols, or surface data about Solana's computing infrastructure and DeFi projects. The plugin can be used to buy NFTs, transfer tokens, inspect transactions, interpret public account data, and find NFT collections by floor price.\n\n\"Every developer building consumer-oriented apps should be thinking about how their app is going to be interacted with through an AI model because this is a new paradigm for telling computers what to do,\" said Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder and Solana Labs CEO (read more about AI from Anatoly here ). \"AI will make Solana more usable and understandable.\"\n\nThe main characteristics of Solana - fast throughput, near zero costs and ease of use - allow AI models to interact seamlessly and efficiently on the network. While only in its early stages, Solana has become the center of a groundswell of AI activity happening in web3.\n\nThe Solana Foundation also announced today that it has increased the amount available in an AI-focused strategic grants program from the originally announced $1 million to up to $10 million. The grants program is intended to encourage the ecosystem to explore new use cases of machine learning models interacting with Solana protocols in safe and interpretable ways. The rolling grants program has already received 50 applications; new and existing projects can apply here .\n\nThe Solana Foundation also kicked-off a 3-month long accelerator program for university students that has a full cohort dedicated to experimenting with blockchain and AI. The program received hundreds of applications from projects and contributors, and the AI cohort has already resulted in an ask Solana U chatbot , which answers questions about Solana development and helps find the right Solana documentation, as well as Solana Audits AI , which is designed to enhance security for Solana-based programs.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem is also making major strides by leaning into AI and several projects are already utilizing AI technology:\n\nFor more information please visit https://solana.com/AI .\n\nAbout Solana Foundation\n\nThe Solana Foundation is a non-profit foundation based in Zug, Switzerland, dedicated to the decentralization, adoption, and security of the Solana network.

        "title": "Solana launches ChatGPT plug-in to help users interact with its network - TechCrunch",
        "content": "As the artificial intelligence market continues to heat up, a number of crypto players \u2014 big and small \u2014 are diving in.\n\nThe Solana Foundation, the nonprofit organization behind the layer-1 blockchain Solana, has officially integrated AI into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in developed by Solana Labs, the team exclusively told TechCrunch+. (Solana Labs is the team building products and tools for the blockchain.)\n\nThe plug-in, which was teased by Solana Labs in late April, will be geared toward end users initially, with a focus on helping them onboard into the web3 space. It can be used to buy and list NFTs, transfer tokens, check out transactions, interpret data and find NFT collections by floor price, Solana Foundation shared.\n\nSolana is plugging ChatGPT into an RPC node that will read data from multiple sources on-chain and disseminate that information to questioning users, said Tal Tchwella, head of product at Solana Labs.\n\nFor example, users can ask the AI questions about NFT collections, which NFTs they can buy with the SOL tokens they have in their account and so on. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of places this could be useful \u2026 we\u2019re hopeful to see more experimentation by dApps \u2014 and that\u2019ll be the exciting part.\u201d\n\nThe ChatGPT plug-in will initially focus on NFTs and given that Solana\u2019s NFT sales by volume was about $58 million in the past 30 days, the subsector is likely a good choice given that it is already heavily used by the blockchain and its users.\n\nBut there\u2019s also initiatives on the developer front to help accelerate the growth of AI within its ecosystem, too, Tchwella shared.\n\nThe ChatGPT integration offers a new way for Solana users and developers to ask the AI service questions, while \u201cmaking the experience simpler,\u201d Tchwella said. As opposed to reading an 800-page document on a Solana-based project, the AI does it for you and then can share answers to people\u2019s questions.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the blockchain space is way too technical,\u201d Tchwella said. Bringing the popular ChatGPT service to Solana \u201coffers a new opportunity for people to engage with it and understand what\u2019s really happening.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the plug-in, the foundation also announced an AI-focused accelerator program for university-level students in early April and, separately, expanded its grant program for AI-focused projects building on Solana from $1 million in late April to $10 million today. In less than a month, over 50 applications were submitted for grants and a few companies have been awarded grants already, a spokesperson shared.\n\nThe grant program isn\u2019t about coming up with ideas and trying to build them but showing Solana the proof of concept of what\u2019s actually working in the realm of AI and will make using the blockchain easier, Tchwella said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just at the beginning of AI integration,\u201d Tchwella said. \u201cIt\u2019s the early innings of all this.\u201d\n\nEveryone is all-in on AI\n\nBroadly speaking, there are myriad potential applications and use cases for AI in the crypto space, and TechCrunch+ has already observed a number of projects across different chains pop up that are focused on the technology.\n\nLast week, Alliance DAO\u2019s most recent cohort of 16 startups presented their ideas during a demo day \u2014 and three of them were AI-focused. Sure, that\u2019s a small fraction of the larger pool, but it\u2019s up from zero AI/crypto startups in its previous demo day from November, which signals that there\u2019s a shift underway in the crypto industry.\n\nOn Solana, there\u2019s also a handful of crypto projects leaning into AI like Context, which built AI-powered chatbots that focus on training itself to understand over 30 Solana-based projects so users can ask it\u2019s AI interface technical questions without having to sift through documentation, codes and more themselves.\n\nTchwella expects that AI technology will be able to streamline the development process for smart contracts \u2014 a key part of blockchain technology that turns the living databases into programmable systems \u2014 and make it easier to build more accessible experiences more generally. He added that the principal at play in bringing AI to Solana is actually rather general: If we can improve things, why not?"
