        "content": "Solana\u2019s SOL has flipped one of its primary rivals, Polygon\u2019s MATIC, to reclaim a spot in the top 10 market caps.\n\nSOL\u2019s valuation was more than triple that of MATIC\u2019s leading around the time of the Terra debacle last May \u2014 $16.8 million to $5 billion.\n\nBut the FTX disaster crushed Solana. The native token for its layer-1 network collapsed upwards of 70% in the weeks following November\u2019s crisis.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried had been one of the protocol\u2019s loudest proponents (and biggest backers), with his venture capital dollars spread far and wide across Solana\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe market quickly rejected SOL and many other tokens in Bankman-Fried\u2019s orbit once allegations of sweeping fraud came to light \u2014 while MATIC began to outperform the market significantly.\n\nPolygon describes itself as a \u201csidechain solution\u201d that assists Ethereum in running smoothly (read: helps it scale). When Solana flipped number-two dogcoin shiba inu (SHIB) in late January, the obvious question was whether MATIC was next.\n\nSOL did briefly eclipse MATIC around that time, for five days in total.\n\nBut it spent most of the time since valued some $2 billion lower.\n\nSolana now has the edge by about $123 million ($7.93 billion to $7.81 billion).\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is the next most valuable cryptocurrency at nearly $9.9 billion.\n\nSOL is still about 40% below its valuation as the FTX scandal struck\n\nWhy has Solana flipped Polygon?\n\nGranted, SOL is only worth about 1.5% more right now. And it could very well be that Polygon re-flips Solana again sometime soon.\n\nBut Solana has seen some interesting developments of late. Solana Saga, a branded Android phone filled with Web3 apps by default in the same vein as HTC\u2019s Exodus range, is now available for public order. That\u2019s exciting for Solana fans.\n\nHelium, the crypto-powered incentivization system for ad-hoc wireless hotspots, also completed its migration to Solana last month. Its community voted to abandon its own blockchain network last September.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say things aren\u2019t buzzing in Polygon world, what with its major corporate NFT partnerships with the likes of Starbucks and DraftKings.\n\nBut a flippening is a flippening.\n\nIs Dogecoin next?\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Tensor is climbing to the top of the Solana NFT marketplace totem pole - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Just two months ago, NFT trading platform Tensor raised $3 million in a seed round. Fast forward to today, and it is close to regaining its position as the biggest Solana-based NFT marketplace based on market share.\n\n\u201cA lot of momentum came from the announcement,\u201d Tensor co-founder Richard Wu said, speaking about the seed round, which TechCrunch covered exclusively in March. \u201cWhen it comes to a marketplace, liquidity is key to attract users, and it had a snowball effect on itself.\u201d\n\nTensor last week reached 45% of Solana\u2019s NFT market share, surpassing Solana-centric NFT marketplace Magic Eden\u2019s 44% share over a seven-day period, according to data collected by Tiexo. While the 1% difference may seem nominal, it\u2019s a huge jump for a fairly new platform up against a giant with almost 200x the users.\n\nTensor launched a private beta in June 2022 and opened to the public the following month. In March, it had over 30,000 monthly active users, and by April, its MAU was up about 317% to over 125,000, co-founder Ilja Moisejevs said.\n\nCompared to Magic Eden, which has 22 million unique monthly visitors, that makes its share of the market is substantial.\n\nMagic Eden has since regained the top slot for Solana-based NFT volume over the past seven days with 44.2% share, per Tiexo data, and Tensor isn\u2019t far behind at 40.5%. But market share is \u201cnot the top priority\u201d for Tensor, Wu said. \u201cFor us, market share is a proxy for what we\u2019re building, but at the end of the day, our goal is to grow Solana 10x.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people on Twitter like to dramatize things,\u201d Moisejevs said. \u201cThey want to see a battle of marketplaces. There\u2019s healthy competition between us [and Magic Eden], but the point we want to drive home is we\u2019re not here to win 80% of a non-existent market. We want us to win, Solana to win, and we will be a bigger business if Solana as a chain does well.\u201d\n\nSolana is the third-largest blockchain for NFTs by sales volume, with over $3.96 billion in all-time sales, according to data from NFT aggregator CryptoSlam. In the past 30 days, Solana NFT sales volume decreased about 24.4% to $73.3 million, the data showed.\n\nIn general, the Solana ecosystem is getting stronger, at least compared to six months ago, Wu said. One prime example of that is the people and projects like Mad Lads, he said, adding that at one point, it was a top collection by volume ahead of some Ethereum blue chip collections. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done and demonstrated with their launch on Solana is incredible.\u201d\n\nMad Lads, a profile picture-focused collection, also helped push the platform to the top, Moisejevs said. In the past 30 days, Mad Lads was the fourth-largest NFT collection by sales volume across all chains, according to CryptoSlam data. It had over $22.2 million in sales during the same time frame.\n\n\u201cWe try to work with creators to reward users and do interesting things to drive engagement, and that\u2019s something that helps us stand out,\u201d Moisejevs said. \u201cWe have an entire page just for Mad Lads; it\u2019s styled to them and looks and feels different. It\u2019s all about them; not about Tensor.\u201d\n\nTensor offers advanced functionalities for \u201cpro NFT traders\u201d like TradingView integration, collectionwide bids and market-making orders. Users on Tensor can buy in bulk on one screen, filter trades easily, and receive and send transactions quickly.\n\nThe platform also began growing more rapidly after it launched loyalty-like reward programs for traders, similar to what the Ethereum-based NFT marketplace Blur did. In fact, that was among the strategies that helped Blur surpass OpenSea. \u201cObviously, Blur is driving a lot and people draw parallels between us and them,\u201d Moisejevs said. \u201cWe don\u2019t encourage it, but it works in our favor.\u201d\n\nIn the near term, the NFT platform plans to double down on new technology like compressed NFTs, which lets creators create a million NFTs for about $100 or a billion NFTs for $1,000, Wu said. Companies like decentralized wireless network Helium have minted or created almost 1 million compressed NFTs on Solana, with each one representing a hotspot owned by users.\n\nCompressed NFTs are a new Solana-centric feature launched in early April that allows creators to mint massive numbers of NFTs for a relatively low cost compared to other blockchains like Ethereum or even the classic Solana NFT minting procedure.\n\n\u201cIf you think about what a lot of companies and platforms want to do, it\u2019s experimenting with NFTs but at a low cost,\u201d Wu noted. \u201cThis will attract a ton of people outside of Solana because this low cost [from compressed NFTs] is only possible on Solana right now.\u201d\n\nWhile the platform started out with a focus on \u201cpro traders,\u201d its main focus going forward is to grow beyond that definition and build an experience where all Solana-based products could work together on its platform, Moisejevs said.\n\nAbout 80% of users on Tensor use light mode, which is similar to traditional marketplaces, while 20% use its pro mode, which is for the more serious NFT traders, Wu said. \u201cThe market for pro traders is eventually going to taper off and plateau, so we\u2019re really digging into not just the pro trader value proposition but the faster UX and clean UX that people are used to.\u201d\n\nInstead of copying and pasting what\u2019s happening on Ethereum, Tensor wants to focus on what\u2019s only possible on Solana, \u201cwhich is compressed NFTs and being cheap and fast on Solana \u2014 we\u2019re pushing toward those value props,\u201d Wu said.\n\nMoisejevs also envisions Tensor expanding beyond Solana to other chains. \u201cIf we get to the point where we\u2019ve done everything we think is worth doing on Solana, I don\u2019t see why we wouldn\u2019t expand to another chain.\u201d\n\nIn the next five years, Moisejevs predicts Solana will have more use cases where NFTs will have to change and adapt. \u201cNFTs on Solana will become a LEGO-like thing in the future, and we\u2019re thinking about how we can cater to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur vision, broadly speaking, is that we want to enable all sorts of applications built on top of NFTs and digital assets,\u201d Wu said."
