        "content": "Rune Christensen, MakerDAO\u2019s co-founder, suggested that a forthcoming appchain dedicated to the DeFi lending protocol could be built using the codebase of Solana.\n\nThat new appchain is part of the so-called Endgame plan, as previously reported by Blockworks. The plan is intended to improve MakerDAO governance and ensure that the protocol itself becomes more self-sustainable. It\u2019s been in the works since May 2022, with the \u201cMaker Constitution\u201d receiving approval earlier this year.\n\nEndgame itself is split into five phases. The final phase \u2014 Phase 5 \u2014 will deploy a new chain, now known as NewChain, as a hub for the backend tools supporting MakerDAO.\n\nRead more: Takeaways From MakerDAO\u2019s 5-phase Endgame Update\n\n\u201cThe most important reason for why NewChain is needed, is that it will allow the ecosystem to use hard forks to gracefully recover from the most severe form of governance attacks or technical failures,\u201d Christensen wrote in an ecosystem discussion post on Friday.\n\n\u201cAfter having researched all the different options available to act as the foundation for NewChain, I believe that the Solana stack is the most promising codebase to explore further,\u201d Christensen went on to write.\n\nHe argued that the code is \u201cengineered well and benefits from being designed long after the bottlenecks and challenges of blockchains were already well understood.\u201d\n\nIf the MakerDAO community voted in favor of the proposal, Christensen suggested that a \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d be formed between MakerDAO and the existing Solana community.\n\nThis could be achieved through maintaining an independent client or providing funding to the Solana ecosystem, he said.\n\n\u201cIt would be strategically beneficial to ensure there is a Two-Stage Gravity Bridge from NewChain to Solana alongside the bridge from NewChain to Ethereum,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt would also provide a useful boost to the network effect of the entire multichain economy.\u201d\n\nAside from a Solana fork, Christensen argued that the only other contender for launching Maker\u2019s new app chain would be the Cosmos SDK.\n\nThe downside, he said, is that the Cosmos ecosystem is not as efficient as Solana, which may make it more expensive to maintain over time.\n\n\u201cCosmos also doesn\u2019t have a strong central foundation organization like Solana has, which could be either a good or bad thing,\u201d Christensen wrote.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that Solana (SOL) has enormous upside potential in the next bull cycle.\n\nIn a new video update, Coin Bureau host Guy Turner says that Solana could go on a huge rally as other digital asset projects compete against SOL in the crypto space.\n\n\u201cSolana could have serious potential during the next crypto bull market. This is simply because most of the new layer-1s have branded themselves as Solana killers. Consider that the cryptos that did the best during the previous cycle were those that branded themselves Ethereum killers.\n\nIn the end, both ETH and these Ethereum killers saw massive gains. It\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll see a similar scenario play with SOL and all the Solana killers during the next cycle. However, this assumes that Ethereum hasn\u2019t already won the layer-1 competition, which, you\u2019ll recall, seems to be the case.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $19.68 at time of writing, down 5.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Binance Coin (BNB), which is at risk of losing key support at the $200 level.\n\nHe believes that the price action of BNB will largely be determined by regulatory developments in the United States, including what happens with the lawsuit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed against Binance.\n\n\u201cNow whether BNB can bounce from its recent lows fundamentally depends on what happens with Binance. If we suddenly start to see positive regulatory developments such as settlements with US authorities, which are reportedly in the works, BNB could explode to the upside on the news.\n\nAlternatively, if the regulatory crackdown on Binance continues, then BNB could continue to suffer. This is what the charts suggest, but I\u2019ll remind you that technicals don\u2019t work too well with exchange tokens. There could be unforeseen zones of support for BNB if it does break below that $200 level.\u201d\n\nBNB is trading for $216 at time of writing, down 3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A recent study by faculty members of the Medell\u00edn-based Universidad EAFIT has yielded new findings about four spider species discovered last year in the Colombian department of Choc\u00f3 and potentially broadened the science community\u2019s understanding of this type of arachnid category and its diversity in the region.\n\nPhoto: Ummidia solana, one of the new spider species discovered in Choc\u00f3. (Photo credit: Mariana Echeverri, Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez Torres, Nicol\u00e1s Pinel, Carlos Peraf\u00e1n)\n\nThe four new spider species (Ummidia solana, Melloina pacifica, Euthycaelus cunampia, and Neischnocolus mecana) are described as \u201cpredatory animals\u201d and \u201cprimarily terrestrial and relatively sedentary,\u201d which helps explain their ability to elude scientists up until now.\n\nEach belongs to the \u201cmygalomorph\u201d group of spiders that is concentrated in tropical regions and accounts for about 6% of the currently known species, including tarantulas, hairy spiders, trapdoor spiders, funnel-web spiders, millimeter-sized spiders, and bald-legged spiders.\n\nSpeaking to Finance Colombia about their discovery, Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez Torres, a researcher and one of the paper\u2019s co-authors, hopes that the findings will have a \u201cpositive impact\u201d in the scientific community and speculates that these creatures may even have the potential to impact the country\u2019s private sector.\n\n\u201cThese newfound species might harbor chemical compounds, enzymes, or other unique biological characteristics with potential applications in diverse domains, such as medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and industry,\u201d he said.\n\nTorres also hopes for the discovery to help further the development of \u201cstrategies aimed at the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources\u201d while advancing research into the spiders\u2019 roles in the ecosystem.\n\nStudy co-author Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez Torres hopes for the discovery to help further the development of \u201cstrategies aimed at the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources\u201d while advancing research into the spiders\u2019 roles in the ecosystem.\n\nWhile Torres and his co-authors hope to explore more of the region to continuing investigating the species discovered there, a lack of funding has thus far kept them from fulfilling all their research goals.\n\n\u201cAs a consequence of this situation, our intention is to promote collaboration and support from institutions interested in endorsing endeavors of this nature, with the aim of fostering and propelling scientific research within the Colombian context,\u201d he said.\n\nThe authors of the research paper \u2014 Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez Torres, Mariana Echeverri, Nicol\u00e1s Pinel, and Carlos Peraf\u00e1nv \u2014 first collected samples of the species in February 2022 in the Choc\u00f3 Biogeographic Region before transporting them for preservation to the Arachnological Collection at the Instituto de Ciencias Naturales at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.\n\nAs home to the Amazon, other rainforests, the Andes mountains and so many other climates within its borders, Colombia is the second most biodiverse country on earth after Brazil."
