        "content": "A prominent crypto venture capital firm is comparing Ethereum (ETH) to the mobile operating system Android and Solana (SOL) to iOS.\n\nIn a new blog post, Placeholder Capital makes a case for why Ethereum and Solana are comparable to the two different operating systems.\n\n\u201cEthereum and Solana are like Android and iOS. Android values modularity: it runs on many different types of devices made by hundreds of manufacturers worldwide; Google only makes 1-2% of them. This approach made it the world\u2019s most popular mobile operating system, with an estimated 60-75% market share.\n\nAndroid\u2019s flexibility has been a boon for hardware companies making anything from smartphones to televisions, as they can bring new products to market without investing billions into building bespoke operating systems. However, such diversity also makes it more difficult to develop apps that seamlessly work across many devices with different specs, screen sizes, and the various versions of Android these devices run.\u201d\n\nThe venture capital firm says that iOS has significant qualities that Android lacks, including a more consistent user experience.\n\n\u201cBy contrast, because Apple makes all iOS devices, it can provide users and developers with a more integrated and consistent experience. The time saved by not having to optimize across different devices can go into delivering better apps that users are willing to pay a premium for, and it\u2019s not uncommon for companies to launch on iOS first as a result.\n\nSo, while Apple has just about a third of the market in terms of distribution, it does a much better job at capturing the value of its ecosystem with a whopping ~60% of all mobile spend, plus all the hardware revenue.\u201d\n\nAccording to Placeholder Capital, Ethereum\u2019s likeness to Android is helping to boost its layer-2 ecosystem.\n\n\u201cEthereum is similar to Android in that it\u2019s quickly becoming more of a platform for third-party networks than the place where most end-users and developers operate.\u201d\n\nSolana offers developers certain benefits over Ethereum, including speed and cost, according to the firm.\n\n\u201cSolana is similar to iOS in how it values tightly integrated components in the name of throughput and performance. There\u2019s much more to it \u2013 different consensus mechanisms and design principles \u2013 but ultimately, Solana as a single, unified network is much faster and cheaper than Ethereum and many other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Better Buy: Ethereum or Solana? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Solana could finally be fulfilling its early promise as a potential \"Ethereum killer.\" Investors are taking notice.\n\nAfter carrying out The Merge last year, Ethereum (ETH 1.54%) has been one of the top-performing cryptos in 2023. It is up more than 30% over the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, a number of other cryptos with large market caps have turned in an even more impressive performance. For example, Solana (SOL 0.67%), an Ethereum rival, is up a stunning 128% year to date. So, should you be buying Solana instead?\n\nInstitutional asset flows\n\nTo help answer that question, consider what's happening with institutional asset flows in the crypto market right now. According to CoinShares, a digital-asset investment firm that tracks the weekly inflows and outflows of digital assets, Solana has become the altcoin of choice for institutional investors. Based on an analysis of digital asset flows, institutional investors appear to be moving their money out of Ethereum and into Solana.\n\nThe latest weekly numbers from CoinShares are stunning, to say the least. Out of the $78 million in net inflows, Solana received more than $24 million of the total. By way of comparison, Ethereum received $10.2 million and Bitcoin (BTC 1.13%) received $43 million. So, the net inflow of institutional investor funds into Solana was more than twice the amount that went into Ethereum.\n\nBy just about any back-of-the-envelope calculation, this shouldn't be happening. Given that Ethereum accounts for nearly 20% of the total capitalization of the crypto market, and Solana accounts for less than 1%, there's no reason to expect institutional investors to allocate so much of their portfolios to Solana. Still, here we are.\n\nAnd this is not a fluke, either. For the first 32 weeks of the year, Solana has seen net inflows in 28 of them, according to CoinShares. Moreover, net inflows into Solana are at their highest levels since March 2022. All of this suggests that momentum is continuing to build around Solana. At the same time, Ethereum continues to see net outflows and is losing momentum.\n\nSolana's long-term growth prospects\n\nThere are several factors that might explain new investor inflows into Solana. Perhaps institutional investors are behaving just like retail investors and are simply chasing performance. With Solana up 122% for the year, this is a distinct possibility.\n\nMoreover, investors might be seeking out altcoins that provide superior diversification benefits. Ethereum still tends to track Bitcoin's performance, while Solana is less correlated with Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, I think there's a much bigger factor at play here: Investors are finally waking up to the fact that Solana is superior to Ethereum as a blockchain in terms of rapid processing speed, low transaction fees, and massive throughput potential. Even after The Merge, Ethereum can still process only 15 to 20 transactions per second; Solana can theoretically process 65,000 transactions per second. That tremendous gap in speeds might help to explain why Visa recently partnered with Solana (and not Ethereum) on a new stablecoin payment project.\n\nTaking a big-picture view, Solana could finally be fulfilling its potential as a so-called \"Ethereum killer.\" Ethereum is the past, and Solana is the future. There's something to be said for the fact that, even after The Merge, Ethereum is nowhere close to Solana's level of performance.\n\nIs Solana really the next Ethereum?\n\nSuppose you consider institutional investors to be the smart money. In that case, it's highly significant that they have been voting with their portfolios and moving money out of Ethereum and into Solana throughout 2023. Do they know something that we don't?\n\nWhile Ethereum has had a remarkable run since its launch in 2015, just about nobody is expecting it to replicate that type of performance. Since 2015, Ethereum is up 44,576.12%. Institutional investors might be looking for the next Ethereum to generate those types of otherworldly crypto gains, and have determined that Solana might fit the bill.\n\nI'm increasingly bullish on Solana as a long-term investment. If it continues to line up big-ticket partners like Visa, then it has a legitimate chance to turn in some impressive long-term returns."
