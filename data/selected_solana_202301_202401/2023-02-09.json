        "content": "After starting the year on a positive note, the value of Solana (SOL) is exhibiting sideway trading pressure that has resulted in uncertainty regarding the asset\u2019s next move. With Solana still looking for more positive fundamentals, interest remains on how the asset will likely trade in the days ahead.\n\nOn this note, the crypto community on CoinMarketCap, through the Price Estimate feature, is forecasting that SOL will likely trade at an average price of $22.94 on February 28, 2023, representing a minor increase of about 0.23% from the token\u2019s price at the time of publishing, according to data obtained by Finbold on February 9.\n\nThe prediction by the community has emanated from votes from 1,312 members, slightly varies from the value set by the machine learning algorithm at PricePedictions. According to the tool, Solana will likely trade at $24.56 on the last day of February 2023.\n\nSolana community price prediction. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nSolana community\u2019s bullish outlook\n\nFrom the prediction, the Solana community is expressing bullishness, considering that the token slumped to below $10 in the wake of the FTX crypto exchange collapse. Notably, Solana had a strong relationship with FTX, and the collapse cast uncertainty on the blockchain\u2019s sustainability.\n\nAlthough SOL has rallied in tandem with the general market, the asset needs strong fundamentals. In this case, contrary to the previous speculation, the network appears resilient.\n\nThis is after Solana\u2019s founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal published a report on the ecosystem\u2019s future that expressed optimism about at a time developers on the blockchain have increased 83% in a single year to over 20,000. The activity has enabled Solana to rank among projects with the highest development activities.\n\nAt the same time, the network is recording increased adoption activity, with a partnership with Brave Browser emerging as the latest. Under the partnership, Solana dApp is now supported by the browser, allowing users to connect to top Solana applications like Magic Eden and conduct decentralized finance (DeFi)-related transactions.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana is facing bearish pressure that threatens to invalidate the asset\u2019s recent gains. The token is changing hands at $22.90 with daily losses of over 3%.\n\nSolana seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nElsewhere, the one-day technical analysis on TradingView is offering mixed signals. A summary of the gauges is for the neutral sentiment at 9, while moving averages are for \u2018sell\u2019 at 9. On the other hand, oscillators are also neutral at 8.\n\nSolana technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nOverall, bears seem to be dominating SOL\u2019s price, and any selling pressure will see the asset possibly slip to the $20 support zone.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "6 best cross-chain bridges in 2023 - TechTarget",
        "content": "As the demand for different blockchain-based Web 3.0 technologies continues to grow, so too does the need to enable interoperability. This is something that is enabled with cross-chain bridge services.\n\nBlockchain is a distributed ledger technology that uses cryptography to provide assurance and integrity to data and transactions. Blockchain networks enable many types of services, including secured databases, immutable ledgers, decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are many blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies that use different blockchain technologies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Solana and Arbitrum. Enabling interoperability and exchange across different blockchain networks is an area where cross-chain bridges -- sometimes also referred to as blockchain bridges -- play an increasingly important role.\n\nWhat is a cross-chain bridge? A cross-chain bridge enables an exchange of information, cryptocurrency or NFTs from one blockchain network to another. It enables the flow of data and tokens across what would otherwise be siloed sets of data on different blockchains. With fiat currency there are many established ways for individuals and businesses to exchange money, creating a globally available and interoperable system of financial payments. Those systems include financial institutions, banks and credit cards that handle foreign exchange. In the world of blockchains, a cross-chain bridge serves an analogous purpose. Exchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge, but it is expensive and more time-consuming. Without the use of a cross-chain bridge, users must first convert a cryptocurrency token into a fiat currency, which often involves fees. They then use currency to get the other desired type of cryptocurrency, incurring more fees and taking time. One characteristic of a cross-chain bridge is that it enables users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another without first changing it to fiat currency. Cross-chain bridges aren't limited to just cryptocurrency value transfer either. An effective cross-chain bridge can also enable the transfer of smart contracts and NFTs from one blockchain environment to another. There are several approaches to enabling transfers with a cross-chain bridge. One common approach is using a wrapped token issued by the cross-chain bridge provider platform. With a wrapped token, the value of one token from a specific blockchain network can be encapsulated inside another token. Wrapped tokens are typically based on the ERC-20 technical specification for an Ethereum network. For example, WBTC is a Bitcoin token wrapped with an ERC-20 Ethereum smart contract. Another approach to enabling cross-chain bridge transfers is by using a liquidity pool. With a liquidity pool, a cross-chain bridge provider holds inventory -- or pools -- of various coins where one can be exchanged for another. Cross-chain bridges can also be a lucrative target for hackers. One of the largest attacks occurred in February 2022, when cross-chain bridge platform Wormhole was the victim of an attack in which the threat actor stole 120,000 wrapped Ethereum tokens -- worth an estimated $320 million at the time of the theft. BNB Chain, also known as Binance Smart Chain, was the victim of an attack in October 2022 that resulted in losses estimated at $570 million. Blockchain bridge analysis vendor Chainalyis has estimated that 69% of cryptocurrency funds stolen in 2022 have been attributed to attacks on cross-chain bridges.
