Bitcoin, XRP and Dogecoin were trading with gains, while Ethereum, BNB and Solana were trading with cuts.Bitcoin (BTC) rose 1.48% to $30,136, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was below the $2,100 level. BTC volume in the last 24 hours stood at approximately $19.04 billion, rising 11.46% in the last 24 hours.\"Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has bounced back to the US$30,000 level, recuperating from earlier losses. Investors seem to have renewed their interest in assets that hold value, despite fading concerns about the banking industry. To continue its upward trend, BTC will need to overcome its next resistance level at US$30,500, while its support level is at US$29,800,\" Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex, said.The total volume in DeFi is currently 4.14 billion, 9.13% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.

        "content": "Crypto-fueled wireless network Helium has successfully completed its anticipated migration from its own layer-1 blockchain platform to Solana. Helium founders and backers see potential for Solana to unlock additional use cases around the network\u2014which may be facilitated by a mass-scale NFT mint tied to the migration.\n\nAs part of the migration process, an NFT is being minted to represent each physical hotspot node running on the Helium network, ultimately tallying over 991,000 Solana NFTs. Hotspot owners will claim their respective NFT when they log into the wallet tied to the hotspot, and owners can still transfer or update hotspot locations as they please.\n\n\"Helium developers took a snapshot of the existing blockchain and loaded the necessary transactions to the new blockchain,\" Helium Foundation Head of Protocol Engineering Noah Prince told Decrypt. \"The contracts are permissionless and on-chain.\"\n\nMore than 150,00 of the NFTs had been minted as of Wednesday morning, per public blockchain data compiled on analytics platform Flipside Crypto. The process appears to be ongoing, although the data on the platform is slightly delayed.\n\nIs Anyone Using Helium? Nova Labs\u2019 New IoT Push May Provide Answers\n\nIt\u2019s the most prominent test case to date for Solana\u2019s new state compression feature, which lets creators mint potentially enormous amounts of NFTs for relatively low cost compared to other platforms\u2014or even to Solana\u2019s standard NFT minting process.\n\nAccording to the Solana Foundation, the process cuts the estimated cost of minting 1 million NFTs to about $113 worth of SOL (as of April 5). Compare that to an estimated $253,000 worth of SOL using Solana without the compression tech, or about $32,800 worth of MATIC on Ethereum scaling network Polygon.\n\nMinting that many NFTs on the Ethereum mainnet would cost creators an estimated $33.6 million, the Solana Foundation claims. Solana\u2019s NFT compression feature potentially provides creators and brands a way to serve up large amounts of NFTs to a broader audience without a significant cost attached.\n\nWhy mint a Solana NFT to represent each of the nearly 1 million Helium hotspots? According to the Helium Foundation, the token works as a network credential and authenticates the hotspot, all in a decentralized fashion. Furthermore, the NFT enables possible ecosystem-wide integrations, including token-gated benefits and access for hotspot owners.\n\nHelium\u2019s migration to Solana was approved via a community vote in September 2022, beginning the months-long process of bringing the \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d\u2014which incentivizes users to share their wireless service by giving them crypto token rewards\u2014to the public blockchain network used for things like NFT collectibles and DeFi protocols.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe original Helium LoRaWAN network, which provides connectivity for lightweight Internet of Things (IoT) devices like sensors and trackers, makes up almost the vast majority of that hotspot tally. Hotspot operators share their home or business internet bandwidth to power the global network, and earn tokens for participating in the network.\n\nAdditionally, Helium plays host to a growing 5G network that\u2019s more consumer-facing and used for devices like smartphones and laptops. It\u2019s relatively nascent, however: the network counts more than 8,000 total hotspots at present, with the early 5G hotspot nodes costing considerably more than the Helium IoT hotspots.\n\nSolana Saga Review: The Web3 Smartphone Has Arrived\n\nNova Labs, which comprises the original Helium network founders, is launching a Helium Mobile smartphone wireless service in the United States this spring, which pairs Helium 5G connectivity with T-Mobile\u2019s nationwide 5G coverage. Helium Mobile is being marketed in tandem with the newly-launched Solana Saga smartphone, which also works with other carriers."
