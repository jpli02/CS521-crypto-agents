        "title": "Base Beats Solana With 111% Rise in TVL Since August - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Despite the regulatory uncertainties that Coinbase is currently navigating, its layer 2 blockchain, Base, is experiencing significant growth. Base has now become the ninth-largest blockchain in terms of total value locked [TVL]. According to data from Defillama, Base\u2019s TVL stands at $370.29 million. It has managed to surpass Solana, which has a TVL of $310.43 million.\n\nAs seen in the chart, Solana\u2019s performance has remained relatively stagnant, while Base has experienced a notable expansion in its TVL. Over a period of 41 days, the growth of the layer 2 network has been quite remarkable. Back in August, the network had a TVL of $175 million; this number has surged by 111% to reach $370 million.\n\nBase also outperformed the Ethereum network. In the month following its launch, Base recorded 1.84 million daily transactions on Sept. 14, whereas Ethereum handled 1.28 million transactions on the same day. Subsequently, Base has consistently outperformed Ethereum\u2019s transaction volume.\n\nNevertheless, Base\u2019s daily transactions fell below the 1 million mark, letting Ethereum regain its leading position. It should be noted that the increase in activity on Base is mainly attributed to the increased use of friend.tech, a decentralized social media network.\n\nAlso Read: Coinbase\u2019s L2 Base Logs 1.4 Million Transactions Post Recent Outage\n\nWill Base Chain issue native tokens?\n\nAfter its launch, Coinbase\u2019s Base faced criticism for harboring more than 500 fraudulent tokens. This caused scammers to make $2 million in profits. However, the network also accommodates numerous legitimate tokens. In light of these developments, the community has been eagerly anticipating the network\u2019s eventual release of its native token.\n\nIn a recent interview, Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, mentioned that the prospect of Base Chain issuing tokens hasn\u2019t been entirely dismissed. However, they are not currently prioritizing the economic and tokenization aspects of the protocol. This decision is driven by the crucial importance of adhering to clear regulations.\n\nAlso Read: 7 Chainlink Integrations Take Place on Ethereum, Base, Polygon"

        "content": "Eclipse will use Solana\u2019s tech stack for its upcoming mainnet launch, the Ethereum layer-2 network project announced. Eclipse\u2019s mainnet is expected to go live before the end of the year.\n\nBy design, a blockchain stack contains four different layers: execution, settlement, consensus and data availability.\n\nBlockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, carry out all these tasks in a single layer. This means that when a transaction is made, the blockchain executes, settles, reaches consensus, and ensures data availability all within the same layer.\n\nModular blockchains, on the other hand, are designed to focus on specific tasks.\n\nNeel Somani, founder of Eclipse, notes that he believes all layer-2s \u2014 validiums, optimiums and zk-rollups \u2014 should be considered \u201cmodular blockchains.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a minimum, they\u2019ve all separated execution from settlement,\u201d he said.\n\nNotably, Eclipse will use Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for execution on its upcoming mainnet. The execution layer is the blockchain layer that holds the code and rules of a transaction; it enables transaction signing and smart contract execution.\n\nOn Ethereum, for example, transactions are executed sequentially. On Solana, however, there is a parallel execution environment. This means that more transactions can be processed at a lower cost.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the biggest difference,\u201d Somani said. \u201cAnother benefit is the \u2018local fee markets,\u2019 meaning if one application gets a ton of activity, it doesn\u2019t impact fees for other apps. It is a smaller set of \u2018opcodes,\u2019 and it\u2019s register-based which makes [zero-knowledge] proving easier.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Eclipse will use Risc Zero for proving. Settlement, like most rollups today, will take place on Ethereum \u2014 meaning that it will utilize Ethereum\u2019s security properties to validate transactions. Data availability (DA) will be derived from Celestia.\n\nRead More: Why data availability sampling matters for blockchain scaling?\n\nUnlike many rollup solutions today, Celestia\u2019s DA layer utilizes Data Availability Sampling (DAS) over having a Data Availability Committee (DAC), meaning there are fewer trust assumptions.\n\nThat said, the team at Eclipse will continue to keep a close eye on Ethereum\u2019s EIP-4844 upgrade and consider migrating to Ethereum\u2019s DA in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become clear that the single-threaded EVM is not sufficient to scale Ethereum, which is why apps are turning to their own app-specific rollups,\u201d Somani told Blockworks. \u201cYet even the most sophisticated designs like Arbitrum are now seeing fee spikes \u2014 and it\u2019s all because of the lack of parallelism and local fee markets.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
