        "title": "Solana's #1 NFT Marketplace Beats Whole NFT Industry on Ethereum - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nSolana's leading NFT marketplace is making waves, boasting nearly as many daily traders as all Ethereum-based NFT platforms combined. This is not just a fluke; it is a testament to the unique synergy between Solana's user-friendly, cost-effective blockchain and the ever-popular world of NFTs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is this a big deal? Solana's blockchain is not just fast; it is also incredibly accessible. Combine that with NFTs, which have a universal appeal, and you've got a recipe for mass adoption. While Ethereum's NFT marketplaces are still performing well, the sheer volume of activity on Solana's top NFT platform should make anyone sit up and take notice.\n\nNow, let's talk numbers. Solana's current total value locked (TVL) stands at approximately $306.8 million, according to DefiLlama. This robust DeFi landscape adds another layer of allure to Solana's NFT marketplace, making it a one-stop-shop for all things crypto.\n\nAs for Solana's price performance, the latest data shows that one SOL is valued at around $18. While this might not be its all-time high, the coin has shown resilience and potential for growth, especially considering the anti-FUD measures Solana influencers are taking in order to battle the effect of the upcoming FTX liquidation.\n\nBut let's not get carried away. Ethereum has its strengths, and its NFT marketplaces are far from obsolete. However, the rapid rise of Solana's NFT platform is a wake-up call. It is a vivid reminder that the crypto space is ever-evolving, and what's hot today might not be tomorrow.\n\nSo, what is the takeaway? Solana and its NFT marketplace are a force to be reckoned with. They have tapped into a formula that combines speed, low costs and mass appeal. And while Ethereum will continue to be a major player in the NFT scene, it might just have to share the spotlight with Solana for a while."

        "title": "First Celebrities Settle Lawsuits Over FTX Deals - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA trio of celebrities have settled lawsuits against them related to sponsorship deals struck with the failed crypto-exchange FTX before it collapsed last year.\n\nTrevor Lawrence, an NFL quarterback for the Jacksonville Jaguars, reportedly settled a suit that accused him of misleading investors in FTX for an undisclosed sum. Youtubers Tom Nash and Kevin Paffrath also agreed to settlements, but the terms were not disclosed.\n\nThese developments were first reported by Bloomberg News.\n\nBefore FTX collapsed, Lawrence had signed a sponsorship deal with Blockfolio, an FTX subsidiary, in 2021. According to a filing submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on August 31, Lawrence received $205,555.35 from the company.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, FTX's then-COO Sina Nader told Decrypt that sponsorships with Lawrence and other celebrities helped to ensure taboos around cryptocurrency were \"officially shattered.\"\n\n\"When it comes to my crypto portfolio, I wanted a long-term partner in the space that I could trust,\" Lawrence said at the time of the Blockfolio deal. The athlete has not commented on the settlement or the Bloomberg report.\n\nNash, a prominent YouTube influencer with 289,000 subscribers, was also paid by FTX for an endorsement, according to a class-action complaint filed against him and other influencers by the Moskowitz Law Firm in March.\n\nAfter FTX collapsed, the complaint states, Nash and other influencers scrubbed their channels of any content touting the company or its disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNash, who is a citizen of Australia, did not initially respond to the lawsuit, prompting Moskowitz to request a federal judge to allow them to serve the lawsuit through a tweet.\n\nPaffrath, another influencer with a following of 1.88 million subscribers on his \u2018Meet Kevin\u2019 YouTube channel, acknowledged in a video on November 17, 2022 that he was previously sponsored by FTX, something that he called a \"scar\" that he regretted.\n\nIn a second video on March 16, one day after being included in Moskowitz's class-action lawsuit, Paffrath doubled down on blaming SBF for the fraud. He described suggestions that influencers contributed to losses from FTX\u2019s fraud as \"ludicrous.\u201d\n\nThese three are part of a longer list of celebrities who FTX worked to cultivate before its demise. Among others now facing legal action for partnering with the exchange are former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, his ex-wife Gisele Bundchen, former NBA player Shaquille O\u2019Neill, and tennis star Naomi Osaka.\n\nNews of these settlements arrive after FTX was hit by a cyber-attack that briefly shut down an online portal for former clients to submit reimbursement claims. Meanwhile, a federal judge authorized FTX to begin selling off the $3.4 billion in Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin and other assets it held as part of the bankruptcy proceedings."

        "title": "What is Next for Render Token (RNDR) after Noteworthy 50% Price Surge? - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "What is Next for Render Token (RNDR) after Noteworthy 50% Price Surge?\n\nMany cryptocurrencies were bullish during the first half of 2023 as investors anticipated a positive global economic outlook. This post covers the performance of Render Token (RNDR) since its inception.\n\nInterestingly, there were no prominent negative events such as hacks during that period. Instead, there were interesting developments in the crypto sector such as the introduction of BTC NFTs, Bitcoin Ordinals, and the launch of the Shanghai Ethereum upgrade, among others.\n\nThe value of Render Token (RNDR) jumps in 2023\n\nThe Render Token is one of the cryptocurrencies that has posted impressive results so far in 2023. In fact, its price is up by 305% year-to-date. Its performance shows that bulls are in control in the RNDR market.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the specific RNDR price movement since April this year. On 28 April RNDR broke above the $2.10 resistance level as it reached a yearly high of $2.41. From there it seemed to surge towards the next important resistance level, $3.10. Unfortunately, it failed to keep the momentum and its price currently sits around $1.60. Nonetheless, it\u2019s performance is still outstanding so far this year.\n\nAs The Graph indicates, RNDR was in an uptrend for most of this year.\n\nThe Eliot Wave theory also gives a good clue on the direction a cryptocurrency or other investment assets will likely take. In our context, the Render Token completed 5 five-wave upward movement in March before it settled at the 0.5 Fib retracement support level within the territory of wave four. The following graph shows the trajectory which the Render Token experienced during March.\n\n\n\nRNDR/USDT 12-Hour chart \u2013 Tradingview\n\nAs observed, the diagram shows that RNDR was set for another sharp upward movement into a long-term wave three. With that thrust the RNDR looked set to reach the $3.10 support resistance level. However, as the 90-day graph shows, the Render Token did not breach that resistance level. Instead, it reached a high of $2.83 as the next graph indicates.\n\n\n\nRNDR Price Performance \u2013 CoinGecko\n\nWhat is the Render Token (RNDR)?\n\nBefore we take a full analysis of the Render Token\u2019s price history let\u2019s understand what RNDR and RNDR network are. The Render token (RNDR) is the native cryptocurrency of Render Network, a decentralized platform that enables individuals and organizations to access distributed GPU power required for computer graphics.\n\nThus, RNDR is a utility token for the marketplace for renting and purchasing GPU resources necessary for rendering 3D scenes, videos and other graphical tasks. Individuals can rent their unused GPU power which projects that Render visual effects and Motion Graphics may need. Therefore, RNDR functions as a means of exchange within the Render Network.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Jules Urbach and based on the Ethereum blockchain, the Render Network aims to promote computer graphics using the blockchain technology. Currently, there is a plan to use the Solana blockchain as well to make its service reach many individuals and projects.\n\nIt is also important to note that RNDR, launched in 2020, is available on many crypto exchanges including Gate.io. As well, since RNDR is based on the Ethereum blockchain it is a token rather than a coin.\n\nRNDR Price history\n\nWhen RNDR was introduced on the market in June 2020 its price was $0.04677. However, it attained a lower value of $0.2699 in August. For the rest of 2020 RNDR experienced peaks and troughs. Once again, it picked momentum in 2021 when it attained a new all-time-high (ATH) of $2.50 in March 2021. Sadly, in June of the same year its price fell below $0.50 and never recovered until November when it attained a new ATH of $8.76.\n\nNonetheless, the Render Token could not maintain the bullish momentum as it lost value again to close the year at $4.61. Although 2022 started on a good note for RNDR whose value shot to $5.44 on 4 January, it lost steam again, closing at $1.81 on 24 January.\n\nThe pulsating ups and downs of the Render token continued until the end of the year. It usually gained much when there were significant events such as listing on a new exchange. For example, RNDR attained a value of $4.17 when it was listed on Coinbase exchange in 2022.\n\nNevertheless, its price dropped to $0.2984 on 19 June 2022, before it attained a high of $0.7927 on 13 August 2022. From that time until 13 October, its value fluctuated between $0.372 and $0.7927. The news of its listing on the crypto banking app Revolut pushed its value to $1.14 on 6 November 2022. Sadly, the unfortunate collapse of FTX forced the price of the token to nosedive and close the year at $0.4025.\n\nLike most cryptocurrencies, 2023 started on a positive note for RNDR whose value fluctuated between $0.40 on January 1st, to its May high of $2.83 and its current price of around $1.60.\n\n\n\nRNDR Price \u2013 CoinGecko\n\nPrice Prediction of Render Token\n\nNow, let\u2019s analyze the potential performance of RNDR for the next 11 months. First RNDR price predictions come from Gate.io which estimates that the value of RNDR will be around $2.36 by the end of 2023 and $2.16 by close of 2024. It also predicts that the price of Render Token will be $2.42 in August 2025.\n\nNext, CaptainAltCoin estimates that the price of RNDR will be $1.32 in June 2023. However, it contends that it will rise to $3.89 in 2025.\n\nFinally, WalletInvestor indicates that RNDR will face tough times throughout 2023 and 2024. As a result, it estimates that the value of Render Token will drop to around $0.211 by April 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its inception in June 2020, the Render token has been experiencing price peaks and troughs. However, it attained an all-time-high of $8.76 in November 2021. It has a current price of $1.62. Some experts predict that RNDR will have a value of between $2.82 and $3.89 in 2025. Crypto investors can trade Render tokens on Gate.io."
