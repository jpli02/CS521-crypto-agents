        "title": "Solana Price Prediction As Bull Trap Puts $SOL At Risk Of 20% Drop - CoinGape",
        "content": "Solana Price Prediction: For nearly a month, the 4th largest cryptocurrency Solana(SOL) has been under a correction trend partially attributed to the uncertainty surrounding the newly launched Bitcoin ETF. In our previous analysis, we market this downfall as the formation of a Flag pattern, commonly observed in an established uptrend. However, the buyers\u2019 attempt to break out of this pattern failed to sustain amid the market sell-off, positioning the SOL price at risk of further downfall.\n\nFake Breakout Triggers a $19 Million Long Liquidation\n\nA failed breakout from the flag pattern hints at prolonged correction in SOL\n\nThe Bollinger band curved on the downside indicates the sellers are aggressive\n\nThe 24-hour trading volume on the Solana coin is $2.7 Billion, indicating a 4.3% gain.\n\nOn January 17th, the Solana price recovery teased a bullish breakout from the resistance trendline of the Flag pattern. This breakout coincided with Solana Network active addresses hitting a high of 429,162 reflecting a sustainable growth opportunity for coin holders.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, the Solana price reentered the Flag on Thursday with a 7.5% intraday loss as the crypto market witnessed a sudden sell-off. With a 6.4% drop today, altcoin showcased a suitable follow-up to the reversal and confirmation of the failed breakout\n\nIn the last two days, the Solana traders have witnessed nearly $19 Million in long-liquidation as per the derivative data analysis platform Coinglass. This forced exit of long traders intensifies selling pressure on this asset, indicating the continuation of the correction trend.\n\nWith sustained selling, the SOL price may tumble 20% before hitting the crucial support zone created by combining the horizontal level of $68 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nSolana Price Sees Bullish Turnaround from 50% FIB Level\n\nThe short-term outlook for the Solana price appears bearish, yet a retracement to the 50% Fibonacci level is viewed as a healthy correction within an overarching uptrend. Such a pullback may provide an opportunity for buyers to regroup and regain momentum, potentially reigniting the previous recovery trajectory. If buyers successfully breach the flag pattern, it could significantly boost buying interest, setting the stage for a push toward a potential target of $166\n\nBollinger Band: The narrow range of the Bollinger Band indicator projects heightened market volatility\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: A bearish crossover state between MACD and the signal line below the neckline would indicate the sellers are in control.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Solana Price Prediction: Will Market Correction Push $SOL Below $60 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Solana price trends have recently undergone a minor retreat following bearish market influences. Currently pegged at $91.93, SOL manifests a modest intraday depreciation exceeding 3%, hinting at a prevalent selling momentum. Market analyses suggest this minor dip might fuel expectations of an impending price descent.\n\nThe market valuation of SOL presently stands at approximately $39 billion, securing its position as the fifth most substantial cryptocurrency, as per CoinMarketCap data. A notable contraction in the 24-hour trading volume by over 3%, amounting to $2.4 billion, underscores a heightened seller interest within the market sphere.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOver the recent week, Solana price trajectory has declined, oscillating between $100 and $91. This phase is marked by lateral trading dynamics, encapsulated within gradually converging trendlines. Despite a marginal weekly drop of 0.78%, a contrasting monthly upsurge of 18% in SOL\u2019s value has been recorded.\n\nSolana\u2019s price experienced a robust surge in December 2023, breaking through the $121 barrier and marking a yearly peak. Despite this ascent, a gradual descent towards the $90 mark has been observed recently. This subtle decline reflects the ongoing tussle for market dominance between the bears and the bulls.\n\nWill Solana Price Reach $60 By the End of The Year?\n\nCrypto analyst Toni Ghinea predicts a significant downturn for Solana, foreseeing a drop to around $60 by late 2024. His projection marks a notable shift in SOL\u2019s market value, reflecting the inherent unpredictability of digital currencies. This insight garners attention as it challenges the current understanding of Solana\u2019s future market behavior.\n\nThe current market dynamics for Solana (SOL) present a scenario of high volatility and uncertainty. With increasing bearish pressure, there\u2019s a growing speculation that SOL could soon approach the $80 mark. This trend, if sustained, could lead to a further decline, potentially bringing the price down to a critical $60 level. Market analysts closely observe these movements, as the continued bearish dominance could significantly influence Solana\u2019s short-term value trajectory.\n\nConversely, a shift in market sentiment could alter this path. Solana can initiate an upward trend if buyers step in with substantial momentum, potentially breaking through the $110 resistance level. Such a bullish swing could pave the way for SOL to retest its previous high of around $121. This optimistic outlook hinges on the strength and consistency of the buying pressure. As the market remains on edge, the coming days are crucial for determining which paths Solana will tread.\n\nThe daily technical analysis for Solana paints a potentially bearish picture in the upcoming period. Current indicators, including most moving averages and oscillators, are neutral, hinting at a prevailing market uncertainty. The Relative Strength Index, standing at a neutral 47, might lean towards oversold conditions if the anticipated bearish trend takes hold.\n\nThe Average Directional Index, currently at 28, aligns with a bearish forecast. Adding to this outlook, both the 20-EMA and 50 Exponential Moving Averages are trending negatively, further supporting the possibility of a bearish phase for SOL.

        "title": "SOL Now Vulnerable To Further Downside. How Concerning Is It for Solana Investors? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Solana has been a standout performer, drawing the attention and excitement of investors. However, while many crypto enthusiast have been focused on the upside potential, we believe the flipside should be considered as well. We may be very bullish very long term on Solana, even our 2024 SOL outlook is bullish, but we are also cognizant of the medium term cycles.\n\nFundamentals matter don\u2019t matter\n\nWhat does the statement \u2018fundamentals matter don\u2019t matter\u2019 really mean?\n\nIt is inspired by the Oracle of Delphi, obviously.\n\nWe believe that fundamentals matter most of the time, but not always.\n\nHere is one really interesting development for Solana\u2019s ecosystem. It should make every crypto enthusiast excited.\n\nOn Solana, we see Anatoly\u2019s vision of a single atomic state machine as a powerful use case of decentralized blockchains, lowering information asymmetry. And we are impressed by all the activity seen on Solana in Q4 2023\n\n-DePIN\n\n-DeFi\n\n-Meme coins\n\n-NFT innovation\n\n-Firedancer \u2014 Franklin Templeton (@FTI_US) January 17, 2024\n\nHowever, fundamentals are not necessarily driving price, not always. SOL fundamentals mattered when it was trading at $20, hugely undervalued. While fundamentals still matter, long term, we should not forget the context: a 6-fold rise requires a cooling off period, no matter how strong fundamentals may be.\n\nDon\u2019t mix up fundamental readings with chart readings.\n\nSolana chart requires a cooling off period\n\nFrom a humble $21 to a staggering $120 between October and December, Solana\u2019s ascent has been nothing short of impressive. This surge is not just a testament to its market performance but also a response to the SEC\u2019s scrutiny, affirming the value created by the Solana project amid regulatory challenges.\n\nNow, let\u2019s shift our focus to the charts, the heartbeat of crypto analysis. The breaking news here is SOL\u2018s breakdown of the falling trendline, an event that\u2019s on the verge of confirmation. A breakdown isn\u2019t merely a technicality; it unleashes a force of downward pressure, potentially altering the trajectory of Solana\u2019s price.\n\nAs we look at chart specifics, the SOL chart reveals crucial support levels at $80, $72, and $64. These levels act as safety nets, providing some stability amidst the tumultuous world of cryptocurrency. However, our analysis suggests a cooling-off period for Solana, projecting a consolidation phase in the $72-$120 range. This breathing space is essential for any asset that experiences rapid growth, allowing it to recalibrate and find its new equilibrium.\n\nBut, and this is a big but, forecasts come with conditions. Our prediction of Solana\u2019s consolidation is contingent on it staying below $110 in February. If Solana defies our expectations and consistently hovers above this mark, it could signal a different narrative. It could potentially challenging the projected cooling-off phase.\n\nLong term bullish Solana, short term neutral with a slight bearish bias\n\nIn conclusion, Solana\u2019s journey, while remarkable, is not immune to the market\u2019s ebb and flow. The breakdown of the falling trendline adds a layer of complexity. The support levels serve as key indicators for potential shifts.\n\nInvestors should keep a keen eye on the charts, recognizing excitement and caution. As Solana navigates these waters, its future path will likely be shaped by how well it balances the heat of its rapid rise with the necessity of a cool-down period.\n\nCRYPTO PREMIUM SERVICE TIP \u2013 This Cryptocurrency Can Rise Up to 8x, Provided \u2018Narrative Effect\u2019 Kicks In.\n\nReceive our crypto FREE newsletter alerts Download 50 crypto investing tips"

        "content": "Solana Mobile is about to drop a second crypto-ready smartphone, and it has already set a new record for preorders.\n\nMeanwhile, Galaxy Fox, is edging closer to the $3 million mark in its presale.\n\nNext-Gen Crypto Phone on the Horizon\n\nSolana Mobile is pulling out all the stops for their second act in the smartphone saga. The new device will keep the essentials \u2013 an integrated crypto wallet, customized Android software, and a dApp store tailored for crypto applications. However, it\u2019s aiming to be budget-friendly, addressing concerns about the original Saga\u2019s hefty price tag. In a world where everyone\u2019s eyeing the bottom line, this move is bound to turn heads.\n\nSaga, Solana\u2019s first crypto-ready phone, faced a bumpy ride initially. Priced at $1,000, it struggled to find its footing. That is until users realized it came with a bonus \u2013 an allocation of $BONK tokens. Suddenly, Saga phones were flying off the shelves, and the secondary market went bonkers. A factory-sealed Saga is now a hot commodity, attracting bids of $3,200 on eBay. That\u2019s a fivefold increase in value over five weeks! This unexpected turn of events is putting Solana Mobile in the limelight.\n\nWhile all eyes are on the upcoming Solana phone, it\u2019s also worth looking at the prices of $SOL and $BONK. After hitting a peak of $122 in December 2023, $SOL has been doing the sideways shuffle, hanging under $100.\n\nDespite this, there\u2019s brewing potential for a bullish revival. With buyers soaking up supply below $90, the market might be in for a bullish spectacle, with resistance levels at $120 and $150 eagerly waiting for their time in the spotlight.\n\nMeanwhile, $BONK has been on a decline after reaching its all-time high of $0.00002445 on December 15. However, like $SOL, the new Solana phone could be the catalyst that will send $BONK soaring.\n\n$GFOX Nears $3M: Galaxy Fox Takes the Crypto Stage\n\nGalaxy Fox is making waves in the crypto arena. With $2.8 million raised and 90% of tokens allotted for Stage 7 already in the hands of early investors, $GFOX is proving as an interesting project. Investors are diving into the presale, drawn by the promise of an eclectic mix of gaming, DeFi, and NFTs.\n\n$GFOX: More Than Just a Memecoin\n\nGalaxy Fox is not your run-of-the-mill memecoin \u2013 it\u2019s a force to be reckoned with. The Web3 endless runner game at the heart of the ecosystem is turning heads, rewarding top-performing players with prizes that convert into $GFOX tokens. Staking, merchandise, the coolest NFT assets, and a dedicated marketplace are all on the horizon.\n\nIn Galaxy Fox\u2019s universe, NFTs also have a vital role. 3,000 of these valuable assets representing Galaxy Fox characters will be launched during the presale, and they can be collected and traded even on secondary markets. NFTs can also be used to enhance gameplay, increasing players\u2019 chances of reaching the top of the leaderboard and earning more rewards.\n\nPresale Frenzy\n\nAs Stage 7 of the presale nears its end, Galaxy Fox is approaching the $3 million mark. The current token price sits at $0.00198, but with the next stage offering the token at a price of $0.002178, the anticipation is building. The price in the next stage will increase by 10% for subsequent Investors.\n\nUsers can visit the Galaxy Fox site to find out more or join the community on Telegram.\n\nLearn more about $GFOX here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join the Community\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.
