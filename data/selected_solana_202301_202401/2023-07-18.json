        "title": "Neon Labs Launches Neon Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on Solana Mainnet, Facilitating Seamless Deployment of Ethereum Projects - CoinTrust",
        "content": "Neon Labs, a blockchain-focused company, recently announced the mainnet launch of its Neon Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the layer-1 blockchain network Solana. This integration opens up the opportunity for Ethereum developers to effortlessly deploy their projects on the Solana network.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a program that enables developers to create smart contract-enabled decentralized applications (dApps) and deploy them on compatible platforms. Previously, without an EVM, projects seeking to deploy Ethereum-based applications on other blockchains had to modify the code to suit the new ecosystem.\n\nNeon EVM offers a solution that bridges the gap between the Ethereum and Solana networks, representing the first-of-its-kind development on the Solana mainnet. The Neon Labs team emphasized that the necessary tools are now available for Ethereum developers to utilize.\n\nTransitioning to the Solana network presents several benefits for Ethereum-based dApps, including reduced operational costs and the advantage of parallel transaction execution on Solana.\n\nNeon Labs is optimistic that their EVM solution will seamlessly integrate with Solana\u2019s high throughput capabilities. However, the claim of Solana being the fastest EVM-compatible blockchain remains a topic of debate among industry participants, as Neon EVM undergoes extensive testing.\n\nMaina Guryeva, the director of Neon Foundation, expressed excitement over the Neon EVM\u2019s launch on Solana Mainnet. She revealed that real-world data gathered during production tests will be presented to showcase its performance.\n\nInitially scheduled for deployment in December 2022 by the Neon Foundation, the EVM solution faced delays due to challenging market conditions at the time. The new deployment date remained undisclosed until now. With the mainnet launch finally realized, popular Ethereum-based projects like Aave and Curve Finance are expected to make their entry into the Solana ecosystem through the Neon EVM."

        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\nNew innovations and projects are continually developing in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies. TMS Network (TMSN) is one such innovation, offering hope and promising to change the crypto market. As TMS Network penetrates the crypto space, Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT) continue to underperform, upsetting token holders who once had strong hopes for them.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Aptos (APT) Face Competition from TMS Network (TMSN):\n\nSolana (SOL) and Aptos (APT), once prominent cryptocurrencies, are now facing increased competition from the innovative TMS Network. SOL, known for its high-performance blockchain and scalability, has encountered issues like network congestion and rising transaction costs. These concerns have led to uncertainties among investors, making them explore alternatives. On the other hand, Aptos (APT) has struggled to gain widespread adoption and attract significant user attention despite its potential.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Aptos (APT) have both been significant players in the cryptocurrency market. Solana (SOL) gained attention for its high-performance blockchain, offering fast transaction speeds and scalability. It aimed to address the scalability issues other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum (ETH), face and positioned itself as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. However, Solana (SOL) has faced its share of obstacles.\n\nOne of the significant challenges Solana (SOL) has encountered is network congestion. As the network\u2019s popularity increased, the transaction volume surged, resulting in congestion and slower transaction processing times. This congestion led to higher transaction costs, diminishing the cost-effectiveness that Solana (SOL) initially promised. These issues have raised concerns among investors and users. This has led them to explore alternative options that offer similar benefits without the scalability and congestion challenges.\n\nAptos (APT), on the other hand, has struggled to gain adoption despite its potential. The project aimed to provide a decentralized payment solution catering to various industries and sectors. However, it has faced difficulties capturing users\u2019 and investors\u2019 attention and trust. The lack of significant user attention can be attributed to factors such as limited marketing efforts, a lack of partnerships, or a competitive landscape.\n\nWith the emergence of TMS Network (TMSN), Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT) now face increased competition. TMS Network introduces a decentralized trading platform offering various innovative features and benefits for traders. It presents a user-friendly and inclusive trading experience that addresses the challenges traders face, such as price manipulation, high trading fees, and a lack of trading education.\n\nTMS Network\u2019s advanced features, including its trading terminal, social trading infrastructure, strategy builder, on-chain analytics, and compatibility with MT4 and MT5 platforms, offer a comprehensive solution for traders looking for a seamless and enjoyable trading experience. These features give TMS Network (TMSN) a competitive edge over Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT), as they directly address the pain points and limitations experienced by traders on other platforms.\n\nMoreover, TMS Network\u2019s revenue-sharing model, where TMS token holders earn commissions from trading volume across the platform, adds another layer of attractiveness for traders and investors. This revenue-sharing opportunity incentivizes token holders and fosters a sense of community and ownership, distinguishing TMS Network from Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT).\n\nTMS Network (TMSN): A New Era for Crypto Investors:\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) introduces a new era for crypto investors by revolutionizing the trading industry. This Ethereum-based decentralized platform allows users to trade all derivatives via cryptocurrency payments, eliminating the need for traditional fiat currency. With instant transaction processing and a seamless trading experience, TMS Network offers convenience and efficiency to traders.\n\nTMSN\u2019s strong utility value has made it a new favorite among investors looking for huge returns in 2023. The platform\u2019s presale campaign has been one of the most successful, outperforming similar campaigns and the entire crypto market. After launch, TMSN is set for a quick rally to hit $1 by August 2023 and over 100x growth as the market eyes a rally.\n\nFor more information on TMS Network (TMSN):\n\nPresale: https://presale.tmsnetwork.io/\n\nWebsite: https://tmsnetwork.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tmsnetworkio\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tmsnetwork_io\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "title": "'Neopets' Cancels NFT Game After Raising Money From Polygon, Avalanche - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJust a few months ago, Neopets Meta CEO Dominic Law publicly promoted the concept of \u201cplay-and-earn\u201d Web3 gaming and told Forbes that the cutesy Neopets franchise offered \u201call the right ingredients\u201d for an NFT game. But now it\u2019s been abruptly canceled\u2014and it\u2019s not entirely clear why.\n\nNeopets Metaverse, a free-to-play title based on the 1999 virtual pet simulator web game, was in its alpha stage of development and the team had already sold over 9,000 Solana NFTs across multiple collections\u2014plus it raised millions from backers including Polygon Ventures and Avalanche's ecosystem fund.\n\nOn Monday, the Neopets Team\u2014which refers to itself as the acronym TNT\u2014published a blog post explaining the Neopets Metaverse shutdown and its pivot to a non-crypto mobile game in development called World of Neopets.\n\nNeopets Metaverse Transition: A Message from The Neopets Team Greetings, Neopians! Change is in the air, and Neopets is entering a new era! But what exactly does that mean? Well, for one, Neopets has new leadership, which is working as a new, cohesive unit with TNT to ensure\u2026 \u2014 Neopets Metaverse (@NeopetsMeta) July 17, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTNT has taken a close look at every nook and cranny of Neopets, and after doing so, the decision has been made to transition away from the Neopets Metaverse game and redistribute those resources to the development of a game that we feel can better reflect our values and vision,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u201cThis decision was not made lightly,\u201d TNT added, \u201cbut it was made for the best reason: we want to design a game that\u2019s more in line with what the community has been asking for!\u201d\n\nNeopets is now also under \u201ca brand new leadership team,\u201d per the post. Does this mean that Law, its Hong Kong-based Web3 advocate who previously worked at various financial firms, is out?\n\nIt actually appears that he\u2019s staying at the company. Law\u2019s Linkedin profile still shows him at Neopets, and his title shifted this month from \u201cChief Metaverse Officer\u201d to CEO. That said, it\u2019s unclear whether it was his decision to move Neopets away from NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaw has not yet responded to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nHowever, Neopets has secured a \u201cmanagement buyout,\u201d meaning it will become independent for the first time in 18 years. Neopets was bought by Viacom in 2005, who later sold it to Jumpstart, which was then acquired by Japanese gaming firm NetDragon\u2014who then shuttered Jumpstart last month.\n\n\u201cFree from the corporate baggage that existed in the past, the newly united TNT has now been entrusted with the decision-making and overall brand strategy of Neopets,\u201d the blog post reads.\n\nThe new Neopets entity is called World of Neopia, Inc. and promises its fans monthly updates, AMAs, and a brand ambassador program. TNT plans to launch a new homepage for Neopets on July 20 and will use an emulator to update its old Flash games and make them playable again.\n\nUnfinished business\n\nIn response to the news, several Twitter users called the now-canceled NFT game \u201ca rug\u201d or rugpull\u2014referring to a type of scam in which creators sell NFTs with promises of future utility, only to abandon said project before the promises are fulfilled without refunding buyers.\n\nNeopets assured one Twitter user that it \u201cwill continue to support the Web3 community.\u201d The company echoed that sentiment in its blog post as well, noting that it will continue to operate a Discord server for NFT holders.\n\nWhile TNT said it has \u201crepurposed some of the best assets\u201d from the canceled game, it\u2019s unclear whether NFT owners will be able to claim refunds or see any benefits in the new mobile game, which does not use any form of crypto. A Neopets representative told Decrypt that it plans to offer NFT owners \"perks,\" including its digital \"NC\" in-game currency and digital items on the platform.\n\n\"We are so grateful for the support of the community that has sprung up around the Neopets digital collectable lines, and as a sign of our appreciation we will be announcing more details on future perks soon,\" the representative said. \"These may include physical merch, NC items, NC, access to IRL events, and more.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe have repurposed some of the best assets from the Neopets Metaverse game, but we have refocused the core game loop and overall direction. We will continue to support the Web3 community that has embraced ownership of these collections. \u2014 Neopets Metaverse (@NeopetsMeta) July 17, 2023\n\nAsked if Neopets pivoted away from NFTs due to community backlash, a company representative told Decrypt, \"Listening to the voices of the community is paramount to the success of our brand. It\u2019s important to our team to listen to the needs and wants of our fans\u2014this is what\u2019s best for Neopets overall.\u201d\n\nNeopets' crypto push\n\nNeopets has a history of exploring NFT integrations. Back in 2018, it briefly experimented with Ethereum NFTs. But Neopets fansite JellyNeo estimates that only 1,800 NFTs were sold, leading to a meager take of roughly $14,500 at the time.\n\nAfter TNT said it had been running Neopets at a loss for over a decade, it raised $4 million in funding in January from a number of venture capital firms, including notable crypto-centric firms. The list included Polygon Ventures, Avalanche's Blizzard Ecosystem Fund, HashKey Capital, IDG Capital, and NetDragon.\n\nA Neopets representative told Decrypt that its backers remain \"extremely supportive\" of the company despite the current pivot away from NFTs.\n\n\u201cOur investors believe in the team\u2019s ability to execute on building a brighter future for Neopets,\" the representative said. \"They are extremely supportive of our vision for the IP and what we have in the pipeline.\"\n\nIn the January funding announcement, HashKey Investment Director Xiao Xiao said that Neopets had \u201cgreat potential in its NFT and P2E [play-to-earn] features,\u201d and that \u201cfounders like Dominic [Law]\u201d were able to \u201calways execute and deliver.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Law himself told Forbes just a few months later that he believes \u201cplay-to-earn\u201d games resemble Ponzi schemes\u2014and that he prefers a \u201cWeb3 gaming\u201d model that prevents speculators from manipulating markets by focusing on fun gameplay first and foremost.\n\nRepresentatives at Ava Labs, IDG, and HashKey did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment. Polygon Ventures declined to comment.\n\nIn January, Law said that the NFT game \u201cwill capture the spirit of the Neopets community.\u201d But now, the Neopets team is singing a different tune\u2014that moving away from NFTs is ultimately best for its community.\n\nBig backlash\n\nGiven the announcement comment about responding to what the community was asking for, the Neopets Metaverse game may have been canceled in part because of the backlash from fans.\n\nOne angry Neopets fan who started the #NoNeoNFTs campaign previously told gaming publication Polygon in 2021 that he believed that NFT games were \u201clow quality and scammy.\u201d The fan also accused the NFT community as a whole of being \u201chomophobic\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d as reasons why he didn\u2019t want the Neopets brand to associate itself with digital assets.\n\nOther publications also slammed Neopets for its decision to release NFTs. The Verge called Neopets NFTs \u201cthe fracking of your child memories.\u201d Kotaku argued that the Neopets NFTs \u201clook like garbage.\u201d And Game Rant claimed that Neopets was going down a \u201charmful path\u201d by releasing NFTs.\n\nWhile Neopets apologized back in 2021 for the \u201cmassive change\u201d brought on by the creation of the Neopets Metaverse game, it continued to build and support its NFT plans\u2014until now, that is."
