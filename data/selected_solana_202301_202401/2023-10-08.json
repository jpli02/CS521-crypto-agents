As per Nansen, this increasing transaction and TVL demonstrate its potential for active economic activity.\n\nSandra, the Nansen analyst, also mentioned a couple of solutions by Solana. For instance, its fee markets and state compressions have addressed major issues in its technology stack.\n\nThe state compression reduced the cost of NFT minting by more than 2,000 times. Before this state compression, minting a million NFTs on the Solana network would cost the creator about $253,000. The compression led to a dramatic drop in the cost to merely $113.\n\nThe Nansen analyst compared Solana with minting a million NFTs on Ethereum or Polygon, which can cost over $33.6 million and $32.8k, respectively.\n\nThe rapid expansion of liquid staking within the Solana network, led by Marinade Finance, Lido Finance, and Jito_sol, was prominently emphasized in the discussion. Nevertheless, despite the substantial growth in Solana\u2019s liquid staking protocols, the report acknowledges that there is still significant potential for further expansion, as only approximately 3% of staked SOL is currently allocated to these protocols.\n\nFurthermore, the analysts mentioned a growing interest in enterprise adoption and payment rails following Visa\u2019s integration of USDC settlement on the Solana blockchain. The Visa USDC integration mainly aimed to bring faster finality and high throughput at virtually negligible costs to users.\n\nOne of the tweets also mentioned potential growth factors, saying,\n\n\u201cOther potential tailwinds for Solana include increased enterprise adoption, success in implementing the Firedancer vision, and growing consumer-facing applications leveraging Solana\u2019s advantages.\u201d\n\nThe report also notes that Solana has been gaining the attention of consumer-facing apps. It praised Solana\u2019s tech feats, potential partnerships, and infrastructure apps, all indicative of its promise.\n\nPotential Challenges on the Horizon\n\nAfter highlighting some of these positives of Solana, the report noted that there are still challenges, including the uncertainty of FTX/Alameda\u2019s SOL holdings. Negative news on these holdings will be a temporary barrier to the growth of SOL.\n\nStill, about 71.8 million SOL, equal to $1.16 billion, is locked on FTX \u2013 about 17% of SOL\u2019s circulating supply and 13% of its total supply. These SOL tokens\u2019 outcome and eventual release will potentially impact the token\u2019s future.\n\nAs per recent reports, around 9.1 million SOL belonging to Alameda Research were unstaked, causing the current price plunges.\n\nSolana\u2019s price action was also possibly another challenge, with the assets trading in the red for the entire year. However, a look at the price since January suggests that SOL began the year trading at around $10 and currently sits above $20."

        "content": "Amid the growing popularity of digital assets, there is an overwhelming need to understand the regulatory standards. Moreover, this includes knowing whether or not you are able to purchase digital assets with your specific financial institution. With regions differing in how they approach the industry, we break down how to buy crypto with Monzo Bank.\n\nMonzo is an online banking company that provides financial services for a host of customers. The company provides personal banking and financial services to those with a Monzo bank account, which is based in the United Kingdom. Yet, does Monzo even allow the purchase of crypto? Let\u2019s delve a bit deeper.\n\nCan You Buy Crypto With Monzo Bank?\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nAlso Read: Bank of America Predicts the Future of the US Economy\n\nIf you are based in the United Kingdom, then you are likely well aware of Monzo Bank. They are a regulated bank in the region, and they service more than 7.4 million customers as of 2023 data. Subsequently, the bank itself has answered questions regarding the ability of users to purchase cryptocurrency with the bank.\n\nAccording to the bank, you cannot buy crypto directly from Monzo Bank. Specifically, the company states that in order to purchase digital assets as a Monzo Bank customer, \u201cyou can use a range of cryptocurrency exchanges to buy crypto as part of your personal banking with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike all regulated banks, from time to time we may block a small number of transactions based on risks,\u201d the financial institution stated. \u201cThis applies to all transactions, not just those involving cryptocurrencies.\n\nTherefore, the ability to purchase crypto with a Monzo Bank account is certainly a possibility; it just requires an intermediary. Customers who utilize Monzo banking services will be able to purchase assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and more with a Monzo bank card as long as they first sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nHow to Purchase Crypto With Monzo Bank?\n\nSource: Crypto News\n\nAlso Read: Crypto-Friendly Banks in Europe?\n\nAs previously mentioned, the only way to purchase crypto with a Monzo bank account is through a cryptocurrency exchange. However, as we have also stated, regulated exchanges are all dependent on where you are located.\n\nFor the purposes of Monzo Bank users, you would be located in the United Kingdom. Therefore, you must sign up with a cryptocurrency exchange in the UK in order to utilize British Pounds (GBP) for your digital asset purchases. Because Monzo doesn\u2019t directly handle crypto, you will be forced to utilize their banking features alongside an exchange.\n\nThe most popular option for your crypto exchange needs would be eToro. Specifically, this option is most beneficial because it is an FCA-regulated platform that accepts British Pound deposits. Indeed, with eToro, you will be able to make your purchases directly from your Monzo application.\n\nThe platform will allow you to invest in more than 3,000 digital assets and other asset classes. Additionally, the processes are rather simple, as eToro makes it easy to sing up and start trading.\n\nFirst, you will need to conduct any verification requirements with the platform. Secondly, you will navigate to the deposit screen. Then, you would select the British pound as your currency in order to start the transfer process. Finally, you will complete the deposit and start purchasing the digital asset of your choosing.\n\nWhat Are the Fees?\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Faces Inflationary Pressures Amid Plunge in Network Fees\n\nAn important part of investing and working through exchanges is understanding what fees you are in for. This is especially important as you embark on your digital asset investment journey alongside Monzo and a prominent crypto exchange.\n\nThere are a lot of fees that you should come to expect as you start investing. Moreover, these can range from withdrawal fees to transaction fees and pricing spreads. However, something that makes eToro a viable investment option is that it remains one of the most cost-effective platforms on the market.\n\nThe platform gives users the opportunity to invest with affordable deposits, helping Monzo users get into the practice. Moreover, they lead the industry in fees with a 1% spread and no commission cost. Therefore, it is ranked ahead of a platform like Coinbase, which offers spread fees that can surpass the 2% mark.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough Monzo Bank does not directly work with digital assets, you can still purchase crypto with them as your banking provider. The company understands the growing industry and doesn\u2019t shy away from its popularity among its customers. Moreover, recognizing new options that are regulatory-compliant and present as a Monzo customer is a huge plus.\n\nThe bank has a working relationship with regulated companies and is seeking to point its users in the right direction. Subsequently, you can be sure that your digital asset investment journey with Monzo is in good hands."
