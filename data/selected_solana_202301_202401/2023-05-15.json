Although Bitcoin's value has decreased by 10 percent since May 5, it has still experienced a substantial increase of 98 percent since hitting its lowest cycle in January. Bitcoin's immediate resistance levels are at $27,400 and $27,800, with the latter having the potential to trigger a significant increase. Meanwhile, the support level for Bitcoin is at $27,000. In a similar trading pattern, Ethereum has also gained over 1 percent and is currently trading at the $1,825 level.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cBitcoin showed stability following a seven-day slump as the largest crypto by market cap traded up in the past 24 hours. However, it remains over 10 percent down since May 5, attributed to profit-taking, low liquidity, and market uncertainties. Ether is changing hands near $1,800, relatively unchanged since early Saturday. On WazirX, Phala Network (PHA) and Verge (XVG) have been the top gainers in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cCurrently, the price of Bitcoin is $27,100 with a support level of $26,300. A break of the previous support level of $26,800 now acts as a resistance level. RSI and MACD indicators indicate an oversold market. If Bitcoin stays above $26,000, there is a good chance of an upside move towards $27,800 or $27,500. The 50-day EMA at $27,500 indicates a strong resistance level, indicating bearish sentiment. $26,000 is a crucial point for Bitcoin and a hold above it could lead to problems at $27,500 or $28,400. Alternatively, the next support could be at $25,300.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market started the week on a positive note as BTC and ETH are up by 1.50 percent and 1.69 percent, respectively. Bitcoin recovered after a steep fall of around 11 percent last week taking the total crypto market cap to $1.14 trillion. The current uptick in the market is mainly due to encouraging macro factors and under-control inflation.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
