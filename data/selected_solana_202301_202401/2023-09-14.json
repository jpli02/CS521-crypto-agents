        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe crypto community has been buzzing about FTX's supposed \"liquidation\" of Solana (SOL) tokens. But let's set the record straight: this is not a fire sale, and it is definitely not a sign that Solana is crashing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst off, the wallet in question belongs to Alameda and holds a staggering 26,740,743 staked SOL, locked until 2025-2028. What is up for grabs in the FTX liquidation is not these SOL tokens but the keys to this wallet. Only the future key holder will have the ability to unstake these tokens when the time comes.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nNow, you might be wondering about the seven million SOL and Wrapped SOL (WSOL) that FTX/Alameda reportedly holds. Well, those have already been presold to the Solana Foundation. When you hear about transfers happening later this week, do not jump to conclusions. The 26 million SOL remain locked, and the seven million SOL is already spoken for.\n\nA glance at Solana's price trends over the past month shows a range between $19.76 and $24.69. While the price has seen some fluctuations, there is no drastic drop or spike that would indicate impending doom. The market seems to be treating Solana with a level of stability, despite the surrounding chatter.\n\nWhat is the takeaway here? Simple. Do not let the term \"liquidation\" throw you off. FTX is not dumping SOL tokens en masse. The locked SOL tokens are staying put until 2025-2028, and the keys to that treasure will change hands \u2014 not the treasure itself.\n\nIn a market that thrives on speculation, it is crucial to separate the wheat from the chaff. Right now, the chaff is the misconception that Solana is in trouble because of FTX's actions. The reality? Solana is holding its ground, and this \"liquidation\" is more of a key exchange than a token dump."

        "title": "FTX Unable to Sell Over 1 Billion USD of Locked Solana (SOL) Holdings Until 2025 \u2013 Dispelling FUD - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "A new market report has triggered FUD within the SOL community, as it reveals that a whopping $128 million worth of SOL is being held by FTX.\n\nThe aforementioned funds are said to belong to the Alameda firm and will remain locked until the year 2025.\n\nFear, uncertainty, and doubt have plagued the Solana network, as bearish reports stir panic amongst Solana (SOL) investors and traders alike.\n\nAltcoins have not had a smooth run in the past weeks, and have only begun attempting to make a much-needed price correction this September. However, for SOL, the 9th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, this recovery might be short-lived.\n\nAccording to Solscan, a real-time update Scanning Tool for the Solana Ecosystem, FTX currently sits on a staggering $1.162 billion worth of crypto assets. This figure is a result of the combination of the value of three publicly available FTX cold storage wallets.\n\nAn estimated $128 million of the $1.162 billion crypto assets held in the FTX cold storage wallet is held in Solana (SOL). Despite this amount being significantly tiny, in comparison to the funds stored in the cold storage wallet, SOL holders are well within their rights to be concerned for the future.\n\nAccording to reports from SolanaCompass, a platform offering token swaps, guides, and tools for stakers on the Solana more than 42.16 million SOLs (67% of that stash) belong to Alameda, a leading principal trading firm that is now defunct.\n\nFTX sits on a whopping $1.162 billion worth of SOL tokens. But wait, here's the twist: https://t.co/JnOV6DBDbF reports that over 42.16 million SOLs (67% of that stash) belong to Alameda and they're LOCKED until 2025! \ud83d\udcc6 No quick, massive dumping in sight! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udeab #SOL #FTX #Solana pic.twitter.com/OLAvqgiMB6 \u2014 Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) September 13, 2023\n\nMarket players are especially sensitive to the fact that the aforementioned crypto sash held in SOL, has been locked by Alameda until 2025. As such, SOL users can find comfort in the fact that no massive SOL dump will take place anytime soon.\n\nMembers of the Solana community reacts to the new development\n\nHowever, the Solana community is still in a state of fear and uncertainty. Some community members took to X (formerly Twitter), to share their thoughts on the new development.\n\nI saw some influencers shilling Solana some time ago. Not looking great. FTX about to dump $680 mil worth of SOL.\n\nOne user wrote. Another user who seems to think that the anticipated dump will not come to pass, but remains convinced that SOL will go to zero, responded by saying;\n\nI\u2019m no fan of Solana but this is not true. The majority is locked and in vesting till 2025-2027. Solana is still crap though and will take a massive hit.\n\nMeanwhile, at the time of this report, the altcoin market seems to have found stability within the green zone. Although a few altcoin tokens are still nursing losses, the majority are raking in new gains. SOL is dotted with the majority at this time, after raking in mild gains over the week.\n\nThe asset trades at a press time price of $18. However, the market could either go upwards or downwards, depending on the trader\u2019s sentiments. It is worth noting that SOL has already lost more than 13% in trading volume.\n\nRecommended for you:"

If your job isnt giving you a raise this year this is a low commitment and flexible way to make extra money without having to get another job. Pet brands need a lot of videos of dogs enjoying their products so that they can use those videos to drive sales. The pet economy is skyrocketing as most people are now nesting with dogs instead of having children. You also get free products to make the videos so i get some of my dogs vitamins and food for free. This is also a great business idea for women since there is ton of flexibility! #ugctips #petcreator #lazysidehustleideas2023 \u266c original sound \u2013 Anti Work Girlboss\n\nThis content creator revealed how her dog makes her $2,000 per month. @gabrielle_judge\n\nThe brands will pay creators for this content, the outlet reported, as it will go up on the brand\u2019s social media accounts instead of your own.\n\n\u201cEssentially, pet brands need a lot of videos of pets using their product,\u201d Judge explained. \u201cIf you have a pet, you\u2019ve probably had ads before where it\u2019s like a random person just walking their dog showing how a cool a leash is, or a new harness is, right?\u201d\n\nSolana is so popular, the very good girl even has clients on retainer.\n\n\u201cThat means we do like 10 to 15 bulk videos a month, and then the brand can do whatever they want with those videos,\u201d Judge said.\n\n\u201cIf they wanna use them for like paid ads, if they wanna post them directly to their TikTok account, whatever,\u201d she continued.\n\nSolana isn\u2019t particularly famous, but she\u2019s still able to bring home the bacon-flavored dog bones. @gabrielle_judge\n\nIt helps that this particular Frenchie is a bit of a ham, and good at taking direction, Judge told The Post \u2014 not that you need a primetime-ready pup to bring home the bacon-flavored dog bones, she said.\n\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t need your dog to be still because the whole point of UGC videos is to create authentic experiences \u2026 to show other potential customers,\u201d she explained.\n\nStill, she said, \u201cit\u2019s best to make sure your dog has solid basic training skills.\u201d\n\nJudge also shared how affiliate links \u2014 where you link out to an online retailer selling the product being talked about \u2014 can earn you sometimes-valuable commissions, particularly if your pet has a larger following.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really easy way to make money on the side,\u201d she said. \u201cYour dog gets to try new products, you\u2019re not harming the dog, the dog is just doing normal stuff that it would normally do, you\u2019re just videotaping it.\u201d\n\nThe content creator revealed that she uses an agency to make her user-generated content, or UGC videos \u2014 but it\u2019s something you can do on your own, according to Business Insider.\n\nIn the comments section of the video, some users were inspired to do the same for themselves.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ll never be a model,\u201d one person joked. \u201cMy dog though, she gets stopped on the street.\u201d\n\nAnother agreed, typing, \u201cWait a minute \ud83e\udd14 everyone always tells me my dog is beautiful.

        "content": "Bitcoin gained in Thursday afternoon trade in Asia. Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies rose with Solana leading gains. Toncoin was the only token to post a loss in the past 24 hours. Overall market sentiment was positive despite the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), released Wednesday, showing that U.S. inflation rose in August.\n\nSee related article: FTX gets green light to sell US$3.4 billion in crypto assets\n\nCrypto market on positive note\n\nBitcoin rose 1.78% to US$26,364 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The largest cryptocurrency in the world gained 2.37% in the past seven days.\n\nEther strengthened 2.3% to US$1,623 but slipped 0.73% on the week.\n\n\u201cThese positive sentiments came amid more regulatory battles in the United States between regulatory bodies and those working in the field of cryptocurrencies and their various applications,\u201d said Samer Hasn, market analyst at multi-asset brokerage firm XS.com.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) imposed a fine of US$1 million on the makers of Stoner Cats 2 non-fungible tokens (NFT) and its accompanying web series on charges of offering and selling unregistered securities as NFTs.\n\nStoner Cats 2 has accepted the regulator\u2019s cease-and-desist order and agreed to the US$1 million civil penalty.\n\n\u201cA settlement to avoid a crushing SEC process without \u2018admitting or denying\u2019 anything is binding on no one. A cynic would call it a PR stunt. What matters is that when seriously challenged in court, the SEC continues to lose,\u201d Stuart Alderoty, chief legal officer of Ripple, said on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nRipple is also fighting its own battle against the SEC. In July, a summary judgment by Judge Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws, but sales on public exchanges to retail investors did not. However, the SEC submitted a filing last Friday that pushed the court of the Southern District of New York to appeal its ruling on the agency\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple Labs.\n\nThe SEC requested the court review its prior ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, which posed \u201cknotty legal problems,\u201d according to the filing.\n\nAnother SEC filing, another hypocritical pivot\u2026\n\n\n\nAfter years of its chairman saying the \u201crules are clear and must be obeyed\u201d the SEC now cries that an appeal is urgently needed to resolve these \u201cknotty legal problems.\" https://t.co/ige4neIWRD \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) September 8, 2023\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token gained 1.23% to US$0.4816, but weakened 3.72% in the past seven days.\n\nSolana was the day\u2019s biggest gainer, rising 5.02% to US$18.81, but lost 3.86% on the week. Global payments giant Visa wrote in a Tuesday research report that Solana blockchain \u201chas attributes like high transaction throughput and scalability at low cost that help make it a good candidate for payments and Visa\u2019s stablecoin settlement pilot.\u201d It announced a partnership with Solana on Sept. 5 to expand its USDC stablecoin settlement pilot to Solana\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.56% to 1.05 trillion while market volume dropped 12.87% to US$27.96 billion.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club tops NFT collections\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.85% in 24 hours to 6.45 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 5.22%. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Solana indexes also declined while the Polygon index rose 9.44%.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume gained 43.13% to US$14.81 million in the past 24 hours, while the number of buyers increased 5.93%, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nAmong blockchains, Ethereum topped rankings, rising 57.59% to US$8.47 million. Polygon and Mythos networks ranked second and third.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) topped collections as sales volume jumped 465.76% to US$1.41 million in the past 24 hours. At the same time, Mythos-based DMarket and Polygon-based DraftKings ranked second and third.\n\nBored Ape has introduced the Made By Apes (MBA) Bodega which will act as the official directory for all valid and active MBA licenses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible to watch Apes build out their IP over the years. The directory is live pulling from on chain MBA licenses to display all the Bored Ape and Mutant Ape creations in one place. Keep your eyes peeled as more licenses are approved and added to the Bodega,\u201d BAYC tweeted.\n\nU.S. futures, Asian equities rise; European bourses mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equity markets mostly rose on Thursday after the People\u2019s Bank of China announced a 25 basis point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio \u2013 the amount of cash lenders must hold in reserve \u2013 for the second time this year to accelerate China\u2019s economic recovery. The announcement does not apply to those that have already implemented a 5% reserve ratio.\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Composite gained while Shenzhen Component Index dropped. South Korea\u2019s Kospi, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 also strengthened.\n\nIndia\u2019s benchmark index Sensex rose 0.08% at the close of trading hours on Thursday. Fitch Ratings on Thursday retained India\u2019s growth forecast for the current fiscal at 6.3%, and 6.5% for next fiscal, as the world\u2019s most populous nation continues to show resilience despite tighter monetary policy and weak exports.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose as of 7.30 p.m. in Hong Kong on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures were all in the green.\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key inflation indicator, rose 3.7% on year in August, an acceleration from 3.2% in July. The August CPI also booked a monthly gain of 0.6%, the biggest increase since June 2022. Meanwhile, the core CPI \u2014 which excludes the volatile food and energy prices \u2014 rose 4.3% by year in August, a deceleration from 4.7% in July and the smallest reading since September 2021.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady in September, before hiking them again next time, according to Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of financial management group deVere.\n\n\u201cThis latest U.S. CPI data is unlikely to move the needle on the Fed\u2019s highly anticipated move to hold rates steady at their meeting next week \u2013 which has already been priced-in by financial markets,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cBut the uptick in inflation gives the U.S. central bank extra reason to be hawkish moving forward. As such, we also expect the Fed will start to prepare the market for a rate increase at its November meeting,\u201d he added.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.5%. It gives a 58.4% chance for another pause in November, up from 56.8% on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. August producer price index (PPI) is set to be released on Thursday, with analysts expecting the data to rise 1.2% by year, up from 0.8% in July.\n\nEuropean bourses were mixed ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) policy meeting on Thursday, which is expected to indicate whether the central bank will increase interest rates further. Eurozone inflation has persistently remained above 5%, significantly above than the central bank\u2019s 2% target, even after nine consecutive increases in borrowing costs.\n\nThe benchmark STOXX 600 gained while Germany\u2019s DAX 40 dropped in morning trading hours in Europe.\n\n(updates with equities section.)"
