        "title": "Benjamin Cowen Says Solana (SOL) Could Repeat Cardano\u2019s (ADA) 2019 Bear Market Turnaround - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "Top crypto trader Benjamin Cowen thinks Solana (SOL) could be in for some rough days ahead before making a big turnaround.\n\nCowen tells his 784,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana has \u201ca bit more resilient\u201d than some other altcoins because of its heavy capitulation at the end of 2022.\n\nThe analyst notes SOL put in a low earlier this year, then put in a high, then \u201cswept the high.\u201d Cowen compares it to Cardano\u2019s (ADA) price trajectory in 2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering if Solana\u2019s now going to sweep the low. So if it breaks down below that trendline [around $16.50], which is an \u2018if/then\u2019 statement, I don\u2019t know for sure if it would, but if it did break down below that trendline, then it makes me wonder \u2014 does it actually go on to sweep the low [around $11]?\n\nNow I know that might be seen as a fairly bearish view, but I can\u2019t help but remember the last cycle when ADA\u2026 did the exact same thing. It basically capitulated over here, put in a high, we then swept the high, and then we went down, and guess what? We swept the lows.\n\nIt was only after Cardano swept the lows that it then took off into a more sustained run. So I\u2019m still thinking that there is a chance that a lot of these altcoins could fade back down and sweep some of their lows, maybe take those lows out. It could even occur as late as right before the halving.\u201d\n\nSOL is trading at $24.20 at time of writing. The 10th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 5% in the past 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Discover SCENE\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp has announced its decision to \u201cpermanently\u201d suspend trading for several altcoins for its U.S.-based users, effective from August 29, 2023.\n\nThe assets that will be affected by the suspension include Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Decentraland (MANA), Polygon (MATIC), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), The Sandbox (SAND), and Solana (SOL).\n\nEstablished in 2011 and currently headquartered in Luxembourg, Bitstamp is the longest-standing crypto exchange. Over the past 24 hours, it's pushed roughly $175 million in volume, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitstamp indicated that the decision was \"necessary\" due to the current regulatory uncertainty in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"We have taken this decision out of an abundance of caution, which we feel is necessary given continued uncertainty in the U.S. regulatory landscape,\" U.S. CEO and global CCO of Bitstamp Bobby Zagottta told Decrypt. \"We are and have always been supportive of clear and complete regulation in the U.S. and around the globe and remain hopeful that there will be improved clarity in the regulatory environment in the U.S. in the coming months.\"\n\nUpdate for our US users \ud83d\udce2 Starting August 29: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments. Execute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected. More info:\u2026 \u2014 Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) August 8, 2023\n\n\u201cAt Bitstamp, we have a comprehensive framework in place to continuously evaluate the cryptocurrencies we provide, taking into account the dynamic regulatory environment,\u201d the exchange said in its announcement Tuesday. \u201cConsidering recent developments, we are making some changes to our crypto offerings\u2014specifically for our customers residing in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe exchange has clarified that although trading activities for these seven tokens will be halted, users can still hold them in their accounts and withdraw them at any time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSEC cracks down on crypto exchanges\n\nBinance.US, the American subsidiary of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Coinbase, the largest crypto trading platform in the U.S., are facing legal challenges as the SEC alleges that multiple tokens available for trading on these platforms qualify as unregistered securities.\n\nThe SEC also alleges that Coinbase operated as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency for years and \u201celevated its interest in increasing its profits over investors\u2019 interests.\u201d\n\nCoinbase filed a motion to dismiss the SEC\u2019s lawsuit on June 28, arguing that the agency does not have statutory authority over the exchange and that its position regarding its powers is \u201cuntenable as a matter of law.\u201d\n\nThis was followed by a federal filing last week, in which the San Francisco-based company asked a judge to dismiss the SEC\u2019s case\n\nLast month, a Coinbase representative told Decrypt that the crypto exchange is engaged in discussions with the SEC and believes \"that transparent and fair rulemaking and Congressional action [\u2026] represent the best path forward for American crypto users and the companies building the cryptoeconomy in the U.S.\u201d"
