        "content": "Wed 31 May 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Charlotte K.\n\nLaunched only in 2020, Solana is one of those layer 1 blockchains that already enjoys a certain level of recognition in the crypto market. In an interview, its co-founder even goes as far as declaring that Solana has the potential to be the Apple of crypto.\n\n\u201cSolana has everything it takes to be the Apple of crypto,\u201d says Raj Gokal (Source: https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1663199518739906561)\n\nSolana has the potential to achieve Apple\u2019s success\n\nInterviewed by TechCrunch on May 29, Raj Gokal didn\u2019t hesitate to compare Solana to the American multinational company, Apple. According to him, his blockchain could very well rival the success of the hardware specialist. He explains that Apple\u2019s success relies on two things:\n\nuser experience\n\nperformance\n\n\u201cSolana shares these two principles,\u201d he stated during the interview, adding, \u201cCreating a seamless user experience is the secret to the success of any platform, be it a smartphone or a blockchain network.\u201d\n\nAccording to the blockchain\u2019s co-founder, Solana has always strived to create a network \u201cthat resembles the regular internet, even though it\u2019s an entirely new financial internet.\u201d To achieve this, they focus on building a fast, efficient, and scalable network. But that\u2019s not all! The blockchain also aims to develop a user-friendly and accessible network for everyone.\n\nSolana thus offers its users various products and services that facilitate access to platforms and all sorts of crypto applications.\n\nIs the blockchain trying to compete with Apple with its \u201cSaga\u201d?\n\nSaga is a Web3-focused Android smartphone launched in April by the Solana blockchain. Essentially, Saga allows its users to experience decentralized applications in a different way.\n\nAlthough not explicitly expressed, Gokal made it clear that Solana\u2019s Saga smartphone is not afraid to compete with Apple products.\n\nFor many members of the crypto community, this is quite a bold vision. Only time will tell if Solana will live up to its claim. Currently, the SOL token holds the eighth position in terms of market capitalization.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!
