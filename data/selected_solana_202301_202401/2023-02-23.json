        "content": "Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal said Ethereum would emerge as the dominant smart contract protocol \u2014 with all other competing layer 1s falling by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking to Ran Neuner on the Crypto Banter YouTube channel, Nailwal described his future vision of the crypto landscape:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a multi-layer 2 environment. There\u2019ll be a layer 1 environment; there will be one single layer 1, which is Ethereum in my mind.\u201d\n\nUser activity will happen on layer 2s that interact with the Ethereum base layer, said Nailwal.\n\nNeuner said, \u201cthat\u2019s a big statement,\u201d and asked Nailwal to clarify whether if thinks the likes of Solana, Aptos, Avalanche, and Cardano will eventually disappear.\n\nNailwal said that none of the previously mentioned protocols had demonstrated significant traction, nor have their respective layer 2s. With that, he declared that no other chain could compete with Ethereum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any significant traction on any of these chains.\u201d\n\nThe video elicited a wide range of comments \u2014 one user pointed out that layers 2s exist to patch the failings of the base layer and that \u201cnew layer 1s\u201d require no patching.\n\nOthers spoke of Nailwal\u2019s shortsightedness for dismissing the multi-chain future.\n\nPolygon woes\n\nOn Feb. 21, Polygon announced cutting 20% of its workforce due to prevailing macroeconomic conditions.\n\nDespite the reduction in headcount, the company said it remains in a strong financial position \u2014 including cash holdings of over $250 million and a MATIC war chest to the tune of 1.9 billion tokens, valued at approximately $2.7 billion.\n\nUsers mentioned a delay in block production that lasted around two hours on Feb. 22. Nailwal attributed the issue to a problem with the native block explorer and recommended users use OKLink in the meantime.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Rollup provider Eclipse launches software to allow Solana apps to be compatible with Polygon - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Customizable rollup provider Eclipse is launching a Solana-focused scaling solution, which allows applications to be compatible with Polygon, the companies exclusively told TechCrunch.\n\nRollups, a part of the layer-2 blockchain ecosystem, are a scaling solution to help make blockchains faster and cheaper. Rollups work by compiling a number of transactions into one bundle to go onto a layer-1 blockchain like Ethereum or Solana. So basically, instead of sending thousands of individual transactions, it\u2019s one larger one that costs less.\n\nThe Polygon Solana \u2014 or Sealevel \u2014 Virtual Machine (SVM) will be powered by Eclipse and will be able to run smart contracts and tooling compatible with Solana, which will ultimately increase throughput speed and interoperability for crypto subsectors like gaming, DeFi and more, Neel Somani, founder of Eclipse, said to TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cEthereum was obviously still really slow and still very expensive, so it was very obvious rollups were the path to scaling Ethereum,\u201d Somani said. \u201cSo we were thinking, what if we made a highly parallelized rollup, but the difference is that we stick to a standard set of tooling that already exists like the Solana Virtual Machine or Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\u201d\n\nThat was the initial motivation behind Eclipse, but it\u2019s evolved into a customizable rollup provider: People can pick their base level (like Polygon or Solana), choose a virtual machine like EVM or SVM, and make customizations in the application that might include different elements at the core level, Somani said.\n\nApplications, games, projects, protocols and more are still \u201ctoo expensive\u201d in the crypto ecosystem, but rollups can help support different use cases without constraining the blockchain, Somani said.\n\nThrough the launch, decentralized applications (dApps) built for the Solana blockchain can migrate or become multichain through the Polygon SVM, which can open up the doors for both communities using and building on different blockchains.\n\nBetween the two communities, there\u2019s been high demand for a collaborative solution in mainly the gaming and physical infrastructure application spaces, Somani said. \u201cThat\u2019s the big areas we\u2019ve been seeing demand for and it\u2019s the areas where Polygon and Solana have been going after lately.\u201d\n\nIn the long term, Eclipse sees this launch as just the beginning for scaling.\n\n\u201cI think this hinges toward a future proliferation of all kinds of virtual machines across all these different base layers,\u201d Somani said. \u201cThis might be one example of an SVM rollup, but we are likely to see SVM on Ethereum mainnet or SVM on other base layers.\u201d\n\nCorrection: The headline on this story was updated to properly reflect the launch of the scaling solution."

        "content": "DeGods, the most valuable NFT project on Solana, has a history of announcing unexpected twists\u2014from upgrading its artwork to buying majority control of a BIG3 basketball team, and even recently putting some of its previously-burned NFTs on Bitcoin.\n\nBut the project\u2019s creators delivered one hell of a Christmas surprise: DeGods will leave Solana.\n\nOn December 25, DeLabs founder Rohun \u201cFrank\u201d Vora revealed his latest \u201csocial experiment,\u201d announcing that DeGods NFTs would be \u201cbridged\u201d over to Ethereum\u2014the largest and most valuable NFT market, with projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks.\n\nMeanwhile, y00ts will be moved over to Polygon, an Ethereum scaling network that\u2019s recently gained traction with brands like Starbucks, Meta, and Nike. The DUST ecosystem token tied to both projects will also be bridged to both Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nFew concrete details about the migration have been announced since then, but for the first time, Frank and Dust Labs CEO Kevin Henrikson exclusively discussed the motivations behind the move with Decrypt and explained the upcoming process.\n\nNot \u2018if,\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019\n\nWhen DeGods launched in late 2021, Solana was near its all-time high price and its NFT scene was rapidly expanding. By the time it became Solana\u2019s most valuable large-scale NFT project last summer, SOL had lost considerable value and the wider NFT market was in freefall.\n\nIn late December, soon after the move was announced, SOL had fallen about 97% from its peak price. Frank had previously tweeted about a potential migration amid Solana\u2019s late-year struggles and faced considerable backlash from the community. Even so, rumors persisted as DeLabs continued fleshing out its actual plans.\n\nHenrikson told Decrypt that Solana was \u201ca great place\u201d to begin life, given the tooling on the network and the fact that its NFT community wasn\u2019t as established as Ethereum\u2019s. But he said that DeLabs had larger-scale ambitions that the team knew would likely someday lead the 10,000 NFT profile picture (PFP) project to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt wasn't about \u2018if,\u2019 it was just a matter of \u2018when\u2019\u2014and that was even in the earliest days of DeGods,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we're gonna be the biggest, most popular NFT collection in the world, you're gonna have to be on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nDeGods Have Ascended: Solana NFT Project Soars Ahead of Buzzy y00ts Launch\n\nDeGods, which has generated nearly $150 million worth of trading volume on Solana, will soon enter the largest market for high-value NFT collections. Frank reaffirmed his goal of making DeGods the \u201cnumber-one luxury NFT in the world.\u201d\n\nCurrently, a DeGods NFT on Solana starts at about $11,500 worth of SOL on the Magic Eden marketplace, but Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club PFPs on Ethereum start at 10 times that amount. It\u2019ll be a new challenge to try and outshine ETH\u2019s heavyweights, but that\u2019s a big part of the appeal for DeLabs.\n\nWhy Polygon?\n\nAs follow-up project y00ts started making waves last summer, DeLabs received outreach from various blockchain networks about launching the NFT collection elsewhere.\n\nIt ultimately rolled out on Solana, but DeLabs sought an eventual destination that could help that collection reach a broader audience and collaborate with sizable brands. Henrikson cited last year\u2019s litany of brand announcements around Polygon, including NFT initiatives from Reddit, Meta, Starbucks, DraftKings, Disney, and beyond, and described it as an opportunity.\n\nPolygon\u2019s \u2018Secret Sauce\u2019: Why Starbucks, Meta, and Reddit Chose the Ethereum Scaler\n\nHe told Decrypt that moving to Polygon is \u201cthe fastest way to get connected to these companies because they'll be on the same chain.\u201d Frank added that in addition to consumer brand deals, Polygon offers access to a growing slate of metaverse game platforms. Many y00ts visual traits were even left blank \u201cso brands can imprint their logos on there,\u201d Frank said.\n\nThe project\u2019s artwork was also designed to be broadly appealing\u2014or \u201cclean enough that I can sell pacifiers and diapers,\u201d Henrikson explained of potential partnerships or licensing deals, but also \u201cmen's cologne and things that are more degen-centric.\u201d\n\nUltimately, DeLabs accepted a $3 million non-equity grant from Polygon Labs as part of the agreement to move y00ts to the network. Frank said that Polygon was \u201cnowhere near the largest bidder in that regard\u201d and that DeLabs chose the network for other reasons, but admitted that \u201cit felt dumb to not take\u201d the grant when so many networks were offering funds.\n\nDeLabs will use the funds to help grow its team and take some of the public-facing emphasis off of Frank, he said. Furthermore, DeLabs and Dust Labs will develop a Polygon NFT launchpad and help incubate new projects, as Polygon Labs President Ryan Wyatt recently discussed on Decrypt\u2019s gm podcast. It\u2019s a move to grow the network\u2019s NFT scene beyond brand apps.\n\n\u201cThe most powerful thing in crypto is aligned incentives,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI personally want to see y00ts succeed, but part of seeing y00ts succeed is seeing the rest of the ecosystem succeed.\u201d\n\nHow it works\n\nDeLabs has set a March 15 launch target for both the DeGods and y00ts bridges, but Henrikson told Decrypt that late March is more realistic. Up until now, it wasn\u2019t exactly clear how the team planned to have users move NFTs between chains\u2014particularly on the point of whether the NFTs could be moved back and forth between the supported chains.\n\nThe bridging process via Wormhole will be an optional \u201cone-way migration\u201d from Solana to the new chain in both cases, Henrikson said, through a \u201cburn and mint\u201d process. Essentially, the Solana version of the PFP will be destroyed, and an identical version will be minted on the new chain and sent to the holder\u2019s designated wallet. There\u2019s no option to undo the migration.\n\nHolders can choose to keep their existing Solana NFT from either collection, but they will lose access to ongoing incentives and future benefits around the projects. For example, the staking rewards offered to both\u2014the DUST token for DeGods and points for y00ts holders\u2014will only continue to accrue for NFTs that have been bridged to Ethereum and Polygon.\n\n\u201cYou want to do the burn-and-mint,\u201d Frank said, \u201cand you want to have some type of incentive for people to get over there in the first week\u2014so that it's like a proper party.\u201d\n\nHenrikson said that Phantom wallet, which supports Solana and has added Ethereum and Polygon in beta, is ideal for this kind of transition as it can all happen in one interface. But the Wormhole process can work with other wallets, starting with any other Solana wallet and ending with the new NFT in the popular Ethereum wallet MetaMask, for example.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nFrank said that DeLabs has purposefully been quiet about future plans ahead of the shift, but that the migration will herald the start of its next phase for both projects. \u201cDeGods Season starts when we get to ETH, and y00ts Season starts when we get to Polygon,\u201d he affirmed.\n\nMoving the projects from Solana to its new respective networks will also serve as a showcase for Dust Labs\u2019 software and technology, Henrikson said, adding that the firm was founded with the ambition of being \u201call-chain or multi-chain.\u201d\n\n'Bitcoin Is the Best Brand in Crypto': Why DeGods NFTs Are Now on Bitcoin\n\nDust Labs, which raised $7 million last year, will offer up its software across multiple chains for other brands and companies to use. He said that doors to potential new opportunities are opening up at a \u201cmuch faster\u201d rate than ever before, thanks in part to support from Polygon Labs and interest from brands that want to help grow the NFT space on that network.\n\nWhile the announcement agitated many Solana die-hards, Frank emphasized that the migration isn\u2019t meant to be a firm goodbye to the original home of DeGods and y00ts. Any unredeemed y00t t00bs NFTs\u2014which holders burn to spawn a y00ts PFP\u2014will continue to live only on Solana, and Frank said that DeLabs would consider building future projects on the chain.\n\nBlur Overtakes OpenSea as Ethereum NFT Trading Skyrockets\n\n\u201cWe have so much love for Solana,\u201d Frank said. \u201cAt times, it can feel very charged on the internet, but for us, it has nothing to do with that. We are honestly excited to see the mantle quote-unquote \u2018passed off\u2019 from us to another set of builders on Solana.\u201d\n\nBut DeLabs and Dust Labs see their future spanning multiple chains, and believe that the best place for DeGods and y00ts to grow is elsewhere. Frank said he\u2019s never bought into the \u201cYuga [Labs] playbook\u201d that many other NFT projects have tried to copy, and that his plan is to branch out in search of new conquests and potentially broader audiences.\n\n\u201cLet's not get complacent here. Let's keep pushing the boundaries and trying things out that are new,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're trying to take big swings, and we are trying to do it in a way that is going to make it exciting on the upside for people to participate.\u201d"

Even so, rumors persisted as DeLabs continued fleshing out its actual plans.\n\nHenrikson told Decrypt that Solana was \u201ca great place\u201d to begin life, given the tooling on the network and the fact that its NFT community wasn\u2019t as established as Ethereum\u2019s. But he said that DeLabs had larger-scale ambitions that the team knew would likely someday lead the 10,000 NFT profile picture (PFP) project to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt wasn't about \u2018if,\u2019 it was just a matter of \u2018when\u2019\u2014and that was even in the earliest days of DeGods,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we're gonna be the biggest, most popular NFT collection in the world, you're gonna have to be on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nDeGods Have Ascended: Solana NFT Project Soars Ahead of Buzzy y00ts Launch\n\nDeGods, which has generated nearly $150 million worth of trading volume on Solana, will soon enter the largest market for high-value NFT collections. Frank reaffirmed his goal of making DeGods the \u201cnumber-one luxury NFT in the world.\u201d\n\nCurrently, a DeGods NFT on Solana starts at about $11,500 worth of SOL on the Magic Eden marketplace, but Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club PFPs on Ethereum start at 10 times that amount. It\u2019ll be a new challenge to try and outshine ETH\u2019s heavyweights, but that\u2019s a big part of the appeal for DeLabs.\n\nWhy Polygon?\n\nAs follow-up project y00ts started making waves last summer, DeLabs received outreach from various blockchain networks about launching the NFT collection elsewhere.\n\nIt ultimately rolled out on Solana, but DeLabs sought an eventual destination that could help that collection reach a broader audience and collaborate with sizable brands. Henrikson cited last year\u2019s litany of brand announcements around Polygon, including NFT initiatives from Reddit, Meta, Starbucks, DraftKings, Disney, and beyond, and described it as an opportunity.\n\nPolygon\u2019s \u2018Secret Sauce\u2019: Why Starbucks, Meta, and Reddit Chose the Ethereum Scaler\n\nHe told Decrypt that moving to Polygon is \u201cthe fastest way to get connected to these companies because they'll be on the same chain.\u201d Frank added that in addition to consumer brand deals, Polygon offers access to a growing slate of metaverse game platforms. Many y00ts visual traits were even left blank \u201cso brands can imprint their logos on there,\u201d Frank said.\n\nThe project\u2019s artwork was also designed to be broadly appealing\u2014or \u201cclean enough that I can sell pacifiers and diapers,\u201d Henrikson explained of potential partnerships or licensing deals, but also \u201cmen's cologne and things that are more degen-centric.\u201d\n\nUltimately, DeLabs accepted a $3 million non-equity grant from Polygon Labs as part of the agreement to move y00ts to the network. Frank said that Polygon was \u201cnowhere near the largest bidder in that regard\u201d and that DeLabs chose the network for other reasons, but admitted that \u201cit felt dumb to not take\u201d the grant when so many networks were offering funds.\n\nDeLabs will use the funds to help grow its team and take some of the public-facing emphasis off of Frank, he said. Furthermore, DeLabs and Dust Labs will develop a Polygon NFT launchpad and help incubate new projects, as Polygon Labs President Ryan Wyatt recently discussed on Decrypt\u2019s gm podcast. It\u2019s a move to grow the network\u2019s NFT scene beyond brand apps.\n\n\u201cThe most powerful thing in crypto is aligned incentives,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI personally want to see y00ts succeed, but part of seeing y00ts succeed is seeing the rest of the ecosystem succeed.\u201d\n\nHow it works\n\nDeLabs has set a March 15 launch target for both the DeGods and y00ts bridges, but Henrikson told Decrypt that late March is more realistic. Up until now, it wasn\u2019t exactly clear how the team planned to have users move NFTs between chains\u2014particularly on the point of whether the NFTs could be moved back and forth between the supported chains.\n\nThe bridging process via Wormhole will be an optional \u201cone-way migration\u201d from Solana to the new chain in both cases, Henrikson said, through a \u201cburn and mint\u201d process. Essentially, the Solana version of the PFP will be destroyed, and an identical version will be minted on the new chain and sent to the holder\u2019s designated wallet. There\u2019s no option to undo the migration.\n\nHolders can choose to keep their existing Solana NFT from either collection, but they will lose access to ongoing incentives and future benefits around the projects. For example, the staking rewards offered to both\u2014the DUST token for DeGods and points for y00ts holders\u2014will only continue to accrue for NFTs that have been bridged to Ethereum and Polygon.\n\n\u201cYou want to do the burn-and-mint,\u201d Frank said, \u201cand you want to have some type of incentive for people to get over there in the first week\u2014so that it's like a proper party.\u201d\n\nHenrikson said that Phantom wallet, which supports Solana and has added Ethereum and Polygon in beta, is ideal for this kind of transition as it can all happen in one interface. But the Wormhole process can work with other wallets, starting with any other Solana wallet and ending with the new NFT in the popular Ethereum wallet MetaMask, for example.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nFrank said that DeLabs has purposefully been quiet about future plans ahead of the shift, but that the migration will herald the start of its next phase for both projects. \u201cDeGods Season starts when we get to ETH, and y00ts Season starts when we get to Polygon,\u201d he affirmed.\n\nMoving the projects from Solana to its new respective networks will also serve as a showcase for Dust Labs\u2019 software and technology, Henrikson said, adding that the firm was founded with the ambition of being \u201call-chain or multi-chain.\u201d\n\n'Bitcoin Is the Best Brand in Crypto': Why DeGods NFTs Are Now on Bitcoin\n\nDust Labs, which raised $7 million last year, will offer up its software across multiple chains for other brands and companies to use. He said that doors to potential new opportunities are opening up at a \u201cmuch faster\u201d rate than ever before, thanks in part to support from Polygon Labs and interest from brands that want to help grow the NFT space on that network.\n\nWhile the announcement agitated many Solana die-hards, Frank emphasized that the migration isn\u2019t meant to be a firm goodbye to the original home of DeGods and y00ts. Any unredeemed y00t t00bs NFTs\u2014which holders burn to spawn a y00ts PFP\u2014will continue to live only on Solana, and Frank said that DeLabs would consider building future projects on the chain.\n\nBlur Overtakes OpenSea as Ethereum NFT Trading Skyrockets\n\n\u201cWe have so much love for Solana,\u201d Frank said. \u201cAt times, it can feel very charged on the internet, but for us, it has nothing to do with that. We are honestly excited to see the mantle quote-unquote \u2018passed off\u2019 from us to another set of builders on Solana.\u201d\n\nBut DeLabs and Dust Labs see their future spanning multiple chains, and believe that the best place for DeGods and y00ts to grow is elsewhere. Frank said he\u2019s never bought into the \u201cYuga [Labs] playbook\u201d that many other NFT projects have tried to copy, and that his plan is to branch out in search of new conquests and potentially broader audiences.\n\n\u201cLet's not get complacent here. Let's keep pushing the boundaries and trying things out that are new,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're trying to take big swings, and we are trying to do it in a way that is going to make it exciting on the upside for people to participate.\u201d"
