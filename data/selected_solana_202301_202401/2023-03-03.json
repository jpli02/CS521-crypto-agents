        "content": "Since its start, cryptocurrency has shown that it is more than just a craze that will eventually fade away. Digital currency is more vital than ever, thanks to the development of blockchain technology as our lives hurl recklessly into the information era. One could feel intimidated by reading through data, percentages, facts, and figures, given the wide variety of crypto coins available. In order to help you better understand your investment alternatives, today we're going to look at a few emerging stars.\n\nCardano (ADA): Safe, Decentralized Transactions\n\nBased on the Ouroboros blockchain architecture, Cardano takes pleasure in providing its customers with safe, decentralized transactions. Cardano seems to be a smart option for a beginning investor, led by a group of \"scientists, engineers, and thinking leaders,\" according to its self-described staff. With a share in the currency owned by each and every ADA bearer, the coin is rising, and for good reason. Moreover, Cardano has a strong research group that worked nonstop to pore over sociological, philosophical, financial, and game theory data in order to ensure that their coin launched in 2017 off to a strong start.\n\nSolana (SOL): Troubling Times Melting Away\n\nSolana, one of the big boys, is well-known (well, among crypto miners, anyway). Solana was established in late 2017 and based its uniqueness only on speed. This altcoin and its blockchain technology are based on research by its creator, Andrey Yakovenko, and revolve around the idea of forcing unfamiliar computers to communicate in accordance with a dependable clock, keeping them in time with one another. In 2018, Solana reported an incredible 500,000 transactions per second during their testing phase. This is the pinnacle of programming.\n\nSolana now occupies a comfortable spot among the top 20 trending coins worldwide as of 2023. The world of alternative currencies is, however, a volatile one, and anything could be lurking around the corner to change the scene.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG): $30 Million And Still Going\n\nWe've previously talked about two of the biggest names in crypto, and it may all sound a little complicated and technical. Thankfully, there are coins available that are just as concerned with fun and user-friendly accessibility as they are with technology.\n\nBig Eyes Coin is a pre-sale coin that is getting ready to take off into the cryptosphere. This adorable coin has its cat-eyes set on the top spot with 200 billion tokens and a remarkable $11.2 million in pre-launch funding. Not to mention, Big Eyes values NFT culture and recognizes its significance in the digital economy.\n\nBig Eyes is seeking to bring a whole new generation to cryptocurrency, and it's a demographic they're cognizant of and empathic with. Big Eyes is branding itself in a warm and approachable manner with its easily recognizable mascot. In recognition of our shared obligation to safeguard the environment, Big Eyes plans to contribute 5% of its community wallet to organizations dedicated to marine conservation.\n\nThis cute coin offers a crazy opportunity to make huge returns with their new loot box scheme; check it out below.\n\nThere is a crypto coin out there for everyone, whether you're searching for something entertaining and user-friendly, you require speed, or you're a more serious trader with a taste for cutting-edge, thoroughly researched technology. The crypto train has undoubtedly started to move quickly down the track. Each of us must decide whether to board when it passes through our small towns or to remain on the platform, skipping the celebration in favor of a peaceful evening at home.\n\nFor more information on Big Eyes Coin:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL"

        "title": "The Best Restaurants In Boracay - The Culture Trip",
        "content": "After a long day of snorkelling and island-hopping, relax and enjoy yourself at one of the 10 best restaurants that Boracay has to offer.\n\nDid you know \u2013 Culture Trip now does bookable, small-group trips? Pick from authentic, immersive Epic Trips, compact and action-packed Mini Trips and sparkling, expansive Sailing Trips.\n\nDos Mestizos\n\nBistro, Spanish, Filipino, $\n\nStart with a few plates of tapas at Dos Mestizos | \u00a9 Dos Mestizos | \u00a9 Dos Mestizos\n\nThis family-run restaurant serves rustic and unpretentious Filipino-Castilian dishes. Dos Mestizos, meaning \u2018two mixed-raced men\u2019 in Spanish, is the brainchild of Jose Carlos Remedios and his friend, the late Jose Ramon Nieto, both of Filipino-Spanish descent. Established well over a decade ago, it is one of the most successful restaurants in Boracay \u2013 serving a selection of soups, tapas and five types of paella that blend Spanish and Philippine influences flawlessly. Their famed tapas night (which happens every Saturday), offers a hearty sampling of small platter bar chow. Don\u2019t forget to visit their newly opened delicatessen Gusto y Gustos, which serves deli sandwiches using freshly baked breads \u2013 filled with succulent meats, Cubano and smokehouse grills and European cheese, smothered in the best condiments and organically grown vegetables from Remedio\u2019s farm in Aklan.\n\nNonie\u2019s\n\nBistro, Filipino, Vegetarian, Vegan, Contemporary, $\n\nOnly the freshest ingredients are used at Nonie\u2019s | \u00a9 Nonie\u2019s | \u00a9 Nonie's\n\nNonie\u2019s is owned by married couple Patrick and Shria Florencio, who quit their corporate jobs to work with food and the community. The trendy restaurant is named after Patrick\u2019s mom, focusing on carefully crafted healthy Filipino meals. The sustainable enterprise highlights locally-sourced produce and the freshest ingredients from suppliers in the community. Nonie\u2019s has great options for vegetarians and specialize in a wide array of smoothies and pressed juices. Try their elegant pumpkin soup followed by a plate of bao sliders \u2013 which also has a vegan option. End the meal with the guilt-free flourless chocolate cake.\n\nSunny Side Caf\u00e9\n\nCafe, Contemporary, $\n\nBefore exploring the sandy beaches of Boracay, start the day right with breakfast or brunch at Sunny Side Caf\u00e9. The venue offers all-day contemporary breakfast dishes, achieving the perfect fusion of Filipino and American cuisines. The relaxing caf\u00e9 sells delicious artisan coffees that you can pair with fluffy pancakes or a brilliant twist on the grilled cheese sandwich served with bacon and mango. All their breads and pastries are freshly baked each day. Walk along Station 3 in White Beach to find it.\n\nLemoni Caf\u00e9\n\nCafe, Contemporary\n\nThis refreshing open-sided venue inside the D\u2019Mall offers all-day Filipino and American breakfasts, healthy salads, and homemade pastries and breads. The perfect place to recover after a night of debauchery \u2013 order brunch and go for the classic eggs benedict.\n\nSubo\n\nBistro, Filipino, Contemporary\n\nExperience Filipino food with a twist at Subo | \u00a9 Subo | \u00a9 Subo\n\nMeaning \u2018a mouthful\u2019 in Tagalog, Subo is not your typical Filipino restaurant. It steers away from tradition and comes up with creative combinations to give Filipino food a fresh feel. Try the hot and sour broth soup called shrimp sinigang, similar to a Thai tom yung that features prawns, tomato, heaps of vegetables and batwan, a local Visayan fruit which serves as a souring agent instead of tamarind. The restaurant\u2019s interiors feature antique Filipino-Spanish styled furniture, wooden floorboards, and windows made of capiz shells. The massive space can accommodate large groups, who can enjoy their meal while serenaded by local guitar players and traditional folk dances.\n\nPrana\n\nBistro, Filipino, Contemporary, Asian, Vegetarian, Vegan\n\nPrana offers a farm to table dining experience | \u00a9 Prana | \u00a9 Prana\n\nIf there\u2019s such a thing as affordable haute cuisine in Boracay, Prana fits the bill. It is the signature restaurant of the Mandala Bay and Spa, who use local produce from their urban farm. The farm is located approximately 100km from Boracay, which in hand supports local producers. Headed by Executive Chef Peter Montemayor, who lived in Thailand and Bali, the spices and tastes of these two countries have been added to Filipino dishes. Cool off with a refreshing Calamansi mint slushie, made from a local citrus that is plucked straight from the garden. Follow this up with the Asian Tuna Tartare starter, that presents freshly-sourced tuna seasoned with lemongrass, ground toasted rice, bulgogi sauce and dried coconut. The menu stays away from red meat and focuses on fabulously presented healthy dishes, with a few that are also vegan-friendly.\n\nSolana Shangri-la Boracay\n\nHotel Restaurant, Filipino, Contemporary\n\nDine in style at Solana Shangri-la, Boracay | \u00a9 Solana Shangri-la Boracay | \u00a9 Solana Shangri-la Boracay\n\nLooking to impress a date with something a little more glamorous? Splash your cash by pre-booking a table at the Solana Shangri-la, which offers impeccable service, great food and a stunning view of Boracay\u2019s sunset. The resort-restaurant features a large wooden terrace based on a cliff, offering a luxurious view of their private beach, with open-sided cabanas, outdoor lounges and tables that rest around a fire pit. Indulge in a variety of cocktails and international and Filipino-style seafood dishes. Start with a refreshing appetizer, \u2018kinilaw na tanigue\u2019, which is a local version of ceviche. Raw narrow-barred Spanish mackerel is marinated in local vinegar and lemons, chilli and other spices.\n\nD\u2019 Talipapa\n\nFarmers\u2019 Market, Asian, Filipino\n\nHave fresh seafood cooked straight from the market at D\u2019Talipapa | \u00a9 Plato D\u2019 Boracay | \u00a9 Plato D' Boracay\n\nPaluto, meaning \u2018to have someone cook\u2019 in Tagalog, is a standard service offered in well-known seafood markets across the Philippines. The goal at D\u2019Talipapa wet market is to purchase the freshest shrimps, crabs, fish or whatever takes your fancy and have one of the many small, family grill restaurants cook it for you. Check the scales and don\u2019t forget to bargain! Any shellfish stir-fried in butter, garlic, and fresh chillies is a sure hit.\n\nSpice Bird\n\nBistro, Contemporary, Filipino, $\n\nDig in to a selection of piri piri marinated meats at Spice Bird | \u00a9 Spice Bird Piri Piri | \u00a9 Spice Bird Piri Piri\n\nFrom the owners of Sunny Side Caf\u00e9 in Boracay, expect high quality and good times at Spice Bird. Conveniently located inside D\u2019Mall, this BBQ restaurant offers a refreshing change from the wealth of seafood on the island. It offers great value for money with large portions, presenting an array of barbequed pork and chicken, which are soaked for 36 hours in their signature piri piri (bird\u2019s eye chilli) marinade. The mains are served with hearty sides and fiery homemade sauces to elevate your dining experience.\n\nSmoke\n\nRestaurant, Filipino\n\nSavour authentic Filipino cuisine at Smoke | \u00a9 Smoke | \u00a9 Smoke\n\nHands down the best value for money family-style Filipino restaurant on the island. Established in 2004, Smoke has two branches in Boracay: the first located in D\u2019Mall market, while the second sits across a Freestyle Kitesurfing school along Bulabog Beach. Popular with locals and travellers on a budget, this is the place to go if you want to sample authentic no-frills Filipino cuisine. Try their ultimate hangover-curing bulalo beef soup, paired with some freshly grilled fish of the day."
