        "title": "Arbaaz Khan plays Roger Federer for Solana | The Work - Campaign India",
        "content": "Blockchain platform Solana has rolled out a film to promote its online hackathon, the Solana Grizzlython.\n\nThe film has been conceptualised by Devaiah Bopanna and Anirudh More and features actor Arbaaz Khan.\n\nThe film begins with Khan posing as Swiss tennis player Roger Federer. He\u2019s seen on a tennis court, decked up in tennis attire. His voiceover states all the accomplishments that Federer achieved throughout his career - while Khan pretends to do them all. He\u2019s seen messing up the shots and doing everything that a professional player would not do. The film ends with stating that while not everyone can become a tennis legend, they can definitely become a coding legend by signing up for the Solana Grizzlython."

        "content": "Mostly reduced to a \u201cfailed actor\u201d or just \u201cBhai ka bhai\u201d by social media, Arbaaz Khan has stayed relatively distant from pop culture in the past few years. His facial similarities with tennis legend Roger Federer have still made him good meme fodder for the Gen-Z but in the post-Cred era of Indian advertising, it seems like Khan is ready to take the joke on himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust check out his latest ad for public blockchain platform Solana.\n\nActing as Roger Federer, Khan indulges in the most bizarrely hilarious display of court tennis with a melodramatic voiceover. In the end, he says, \u201cMaybe not everyone can be a tennis legend but you know what you can be - a coding legend.\u201d\n\nThe ad is revealed to be around Solana\u2019s new Hackathon event. The jokes don\u2019t end till the very last second as Khan says \u201cROGER-ster now\u201d."

        "content": "Bloomberg\u2019s lead commodity strategist says that scaling solutions on Ethereum (ETH) may be threatening the rise of the alternative layer-1s like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nIn a new report on crypto assets, Mike McGlone says that Ethereum layer-2s are gaining rapid adoption, and are stopping the flow of new users from Ethereum into alternative layer-1s trying to rival the top smart contract platform.\n\n\u201cEven as activity declined on the Ethereum base chain, 2022 was a pivotal year for the asset, as the adoption of NFTs and Web3 applications on Layer-2 chains drove massive network effects. Layer-2s (L2s) is an umbrella term for blockchain-scaling solutions that attempt to address the constraints that Ethereum currently confronts\u2026\n\nSharding in late 2023 is intended to alleviate scalability issues. In the meantime, L2s have stepped in to enhance the user experience and stop the flow of users to alternative layer-1 chains such as Solana, Avalanche.\u201d\n\nMcGlone notes that activity on layer-2s has now eclipsed activity on the base layer. The analyst says Polygon (MATIC) in particular has outshined the rest of the layer-2 ecosystem, and has the stats to prove it.\n\n\u201cAfter averaging 250,000 daily active addresses in the prior months, L2s erupted in October 2022 and overtook the base chain. They now consistently maintain more than 400,000 daily active addresses. Daily active addresses on rollup or L2 chains rose 86% in 2022, versus a 33% decline on Ethereum. Polygon Becomes Beacon for Developers.\n\nNo L2 has created more network effects for Ethereum than Polygon. Polygon started as a sidechain but pivoted to an aggregator of technologies focusing on zero-knowledge (zk) rollups. A blockchain game-changer, Zk proofs, a method of proving the possession of certain information without revealing any of the data itself, enhance privacy and speed up transactions.\u201d\n\nThe commodities strategist also says that some of the corporate partnerships that Polygon has attracted, including from CocaCola, Reddit and Meta, give Polygon an advantage when it comes to adoption and regulatory compliance.\n\n\u201cPutting aside the potential regulatory issues which may arise from a traditional company\u2019s involvement in the issuance of its own token MATIC \u2013 see upcoming Ripple/SEC court case \u2013 the quality of the corporations it has brought on board bodes well for adoption potential. Companies like CocaCola, Starbucks, Reddit, and Meta have launched their NFTs as an introductory Web3 product or integrated with Polygon\u2019s NFT marketplaces.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, MATIC is trading at $1.22.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
