        "title": "Crypto week at glance: How the market moved - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the start of this week, most cryptocurrencies were experiencing losses due to a correction phase that had occurred the previous week. This dip could be attributed to a combination of factors, including unusually large sell orders on Binance and higher-than-expected inflation data from the U.K. As a result, investors and traders were moving away from riskier assets, causing the market to react as expected.During this period, Bitcoin \u2019s value dropped below the $28,000 level. However, on Wednesday, the cryptocurrency saw an increase above this level, which may be because of concerns over banking stability following the announcement of a $100 billion deposit loss by First Republic Bank during its Q1 earnings presentation. Additionally, investors responded positively to the upbeat Q1 earnings reports of Alphabet and Microsoft.As of Friday, BTC was seen changing hands at the $29,400 level, with support at the $29,250 level and resistance at the $29,800 level. Investors and traders may also be anticipating the upcoming FOMC meeting on interest rate decisions, which is scheduled for next week.Meanwhile, Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, is currently trading at the $1,900 level. ETH is consolidating and facing resistance near the $1,925 level, and a close above this level may initiate a fresh rally.In an interesting turn of events, the European Parliament has finally passed MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) legislation after being in the works for over two-and-a-half years. It is one of its kind milestones in the development of the crypto industry. The new legal framework created by MiCA would also increase investor confidence in the crypto industry by promoting transparency, reducing fraud, and preventing money laundering. It would also lead to greater adoption of cryptocurrencies by businesses and individuals.Since March, First Republic Bank has encountered difficulties after being bailed out by JP Morgan, BOA, and other institutions with $30B due to SVB's collapse. In its latest earnings report on Monday, the bank revealed that it would have to lay off over 20% of its workforce. To avoid bankruptcy, the bank is anticipated to enter government receivership. This resulted in a sharp decline of its stock price, which plummeted by almost 50% on Tuesday and another 30% on Wednesday.Solana Labs is taking an intriguing step into the realm of artificial intelligence by introducing a ChatGPT plugin. Through the upcoming plugin, users will be able to explore the Solana blockchain using OpenAI's conversational chatbot technology. Solana Labs envisions that this innovation will simplify users' interaction with the Solana blockchain.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing cryptos over the past week. (The prices are updated as per the pricing of Friday)1. Render Token is up by 36%2. Cronos is up by 18%3. Injective is up by 14%4. MultiversX is up by 13%5. WOO Network is up by 9%1. PancakeSwap is down by 21%2. Zilliqa is down by 10%3. Optimism is down by 10%4. OKB is down by 10%5. Synthetix is down by 8%"

        "title": "Solana (SOL) or Binance Smart Chain (BSC)? Experts Are Recommend Top New Altcoin Collateral Network (COLT) - The Portugal News",
        "content": "SOL and BNB are both native tokens of their own blockchain, and are used as gas to pay for transactions. More than that though, SOL and BNB also represent the people\u2019s sentiment on the Solana (SOL) Chain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nBy Advertiser, in Crypto \u00b7 29 Apr 2023, 09:01 \u00b7 0 Comments\n\nThese chains allow people to access the world of decentralized finance and NFTs. Collateral Network (COLT) also brings DeFi to the people, making it simple for borrowers and lenders around the world to unlock cash from their physical assets, whilst cutting out the bank. COLT is in the second stage of its presale which has witnessed a 40% surge in price to $0.014.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana (SOL) Pay - the next Apple Pay? Or PayPal?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fast speeds of Solana (SOL) make it an ideal candidate to make digital payments seamless and usable in day to day life. As anyone who is familiar with crypto will know, the actual process of doing certain things with crypto or paying for things in the real world, is much more difficult than is required for mass adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\nPayPal changed the online payments world and now a more cost effective solution is needed, as small businesses feel the squeeze of the less than ideal exchange rates, and fees. With this in mind, Solana (SOL) has the potential to make a significant impact, particularly with the launch of Solana Pay approximately a year ago. Solana Pay is a payment service from Solana (SOL) that enables merchants and consumers to transact directly, bypassing the need for expensive intermediaries. It uses the Solana (SOL) native SOL token and fees are tiny.\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless there are drawbacks and risks. Solana (SOL) has regular outages and other problems including a recent unplanned \u2018forking event\u2019. Until Solana (SOL) Labs can sort out its tech, it seems unlikely that Solana (SOL) will become a mainstream payment provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nPancakeSwap V3 to be released on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in April\n\n\n\n\n\nPancakeSwap is one of the oldest DEXes, and the first place that most on-chain newbies come to buy or exchange a new and exciting token. Whilst there may be cheaper DEXes for everyday exchanges, PancakeSwap is easily available through Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and has almost every new coin on the BNB blockchain. With V3 will come increased liquidity provider rewards and exclusive (non tradeable) NFTs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC) invested heavily in PancakeSwap last June, showing their commitment to the most famous of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) DEXes. This launch is likely to get many DeFi lovers back on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and buying and using BNB, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) native gas token. BNB prices are also affected by the amount of trading on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) CEX, since BNB is used to pay for transaction fees on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\n\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) shows promise and is in stage 2 of its presale\n\n\n\n\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is pioneering the concept of creating NFTs backed by physical assets, which can then be divided into fractions through fractionalisation and then sold to the community to finance peer-to-peer loans. These NFTs can be used to represent almost any physical asset, including supercars, fine art and watches to name a few, and provides a quicker route for obtaining loans than traditional institutions through Collateral Network (COLT).\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike banks who reuse your money many times over after you deposit it, and also, bizarrely, get to use the value of your loans to make more money, these NFTs are backed 1-1 by the asset they represent through Collateral Network (COLT). This provides a simple but effective solution for those looking for capital or cash flow in a hurry, as cash is received for the asset within 24 hours. Collateral Network (COLT) also gives the opportunity for ordinary people to make money in the form of interest from lending towards the NFTs in order to raise the money for the loans for borrowers on the Collateral Network (COLT) platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOLT is the native token of the Collateral Network (COLT) platform and allows trading discounts and access to better rates of interest. Presale COLT holders will be given a special bonus that allows them access to auctions of distressed assets - assets which are given a lower valuation due to the need for a quick sale from borrowers defaulting on their loan repayments back to lenders\u2019. Collateral Network (COLT) tokens are purchasable at $0.014 and experts predict a potential 3500% surge from here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\n"
