        "title": "Solana price spikes after the deBridge launch: Beware of low volume - CoinJournal",
        "content": "Solana price went vertical after the launch of deBridge.\n\nThis feature will make it possible for Solana to communicate with EVM.\n\nSolana price staged a strong comeback on Thursday as investors cheered a new bridge in the ecosystem. SOL jumped to a high of $18.21, which was much higher than this month\u2019s low of $13.56. It was among the best-performing cryptocurrencies on Thursday.\n\nSolana and Ethereum bridge\n\nSolana is a leading blockchain platform that was once the biggest players in industries like decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens. At its peak, its DeFi ecosystem had billions of total value locked (TVL). All this came tumbling down following the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research. The two companies were among the biggest contributors to its ecosystem.\n\nThe main reason why Solana price jumped is the launch of deBridge feature that allows Solana to communicate with Ethereum. This is the first time that the two ecosystems can communicate with each other.\n\nThey can also communicate with other Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM) like Arbitrum and Optimism. Without this bridge, the alternative communication process is using wrapped and other derivative tokens. In a note, the founder of deBridge said that:\n\n\u201cUsers and projects that needed to transfer liquidity to Solana have always faced limitations due to the lack of liquidity in Wormhole pools and high slippage during the exchange of the wrapped assets, which often made developers have to deal with non-liquid Wormhole assets.\u201d\n\nSolana price also jumped as signs emerged that the new management will relaunch FTX. As we have written before , the management is speaking with counterparties as it works to relaunch the exchange. It is not clear what this relaunch will mean for Solana and other companies that FTX had invested in like Near Protocol and Serum.\n\nSolana price prediction\n\nThe daily chart shows that the SOL price has been under pressure in the past few months. This trend saw it drop to the January low of $13.35 this month. It has made a modest recovery and is now attempting to move above the 50-day moving average. It has also jumped above the resistance at $16.05.\n\nThe red flag I have with Solana is that this jump has not been accompanied by higher relative volume. Therefore, I suspect that it will be short-lived, which will see it drop to the support at $16. The only caveat for the bearish view is if Bitcoin stages a comeback above its year-to-date high of $31,400.\n\nHow to buy Solana"

        "content": "Solana (SOL) witnessed an unprecedented surge in its price on June 29, with the DeFi asset exhibiting remarkable growth and entering double-digit territory over the last 24 hours.\n\nConsequently, Solana has now positioned itself at the forefront of the cryptocurrency market, surpassing all other assets in the top 100 by market cap in terms of gains, as it steadily advances towards the significant milestone of $20, a level that carries considerable psychological significance.\n\nSOL is changing hands at $17.96, up 10.93% and 6.18% across the week, with a total market worth of $7.1 billion. Over the past 30 days, SOL has enjoyed 19 green days, accounting for approximately 63% of the period.\n\nSOL 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nSolana exhibits notable support and resistance levels, with $15.09 acting as support and $17.87 serving as resistance. Presently, SOL is positioned above the resistance level, and if it can maintain support beyond this threshold following its breakthrough, it could indicate a potential trajectory toward reclaiming the $20 mark.\n\nSolana is currently trading below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and below the 50-day SMA, and this indicator has been signaling SELL for the last 24 days since June 05, 2023.\n\nSolana price prediction\n\n1-month from now, Solana is predicted to trade at $26.71, so although it is over a 60% price increase from its current price, it is not projected to hit over $30 at least within the next six months, according to CoinCodex\u2019s, technical indicators.\n\nSOL 1-month price prediction. Source: CoinCodex\n\nAs things stand, the current Solana sentiment is Bearish, while the Fear & Greed Index is showing 54 (Neutral). Meanwhile, Solana recorded 19/30 (63%) green days with 13.25% price volatility over the last 30 days.\n\nSOL daily active addresses\n\nElsewhere, this week in 48 hours, Solana witnessed a remarkable surge in its daily active addresses, with an impressive jump of 100,000. This surge in active addresses signifies a substantial increase in user engagement and interest in the platform.\n\nNotably, Solana has surpassed Ethereum in this aspect and is steadily approaching Polygon\u2019s popularity and usage levels.\n\nNew: Solana Daily Active Addresses jump 100K in 48 hours, as it surpasses Ethereum and approaches Polygon. pic.twitter.com/gd5V1LW32p \u2014 Step Data Insights (@StepDataInsight) June 27, 2023\n\nFinally, on June 29, the high-performance cross-chain trading between Solana and Ethereum Virtual Machine chains went live. A Solana user can access EVM-based blockchains for the first time without relying on derivative tokens or wrapped tokens.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "It\u2019s been a year since singer, songwriter and producer Lyle Lovett put out his most recent album, \u201c12th of June.\u201d\n\nThe effort is his first album in a decade and the follow up to 2012\u2019s \u201cRelease Me.\u201d In yet another example of the pandemic getting in the way of the best laid plans, Lovett had things all lined up for a much earlier arrival of his latest batch of music. But he\u2019s back out on the road now and looking forward to sharing the songs and messages on tour with his Large Band this summer.\n\nThe crew hits the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach Monday, July 3 and Tuesday, July 4 before heading to The Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on Wednesday, July 5 and the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills on Thursday, July 6.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll play material from across my catalog, but we will definitely feature material from this (new) album,\u201d the 65-year-old Texas native said during a recent phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always fun to have a new record out and it\u2019s always fun to have a reason to play those newly recorded songs.\u201d\n\nCountry singer-songwriter Lyle Lovett will bring His Large Band to Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach on July 3-4; The Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on July 5; and Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills on July 6.

(Photo by Suzanne Cordeiro, AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe album was recorded in November 2019, with the idea of finishing by March of 2020, Lovett shared.\n\n\u201cI did an acoustic group tour that started in January and ended up on the 7th of March that year,\u201d he continued. \u201cI was going to spend the rest of the month working on the record and finishing it for a 2020 release. And of course, that did not happen.\u201d\n\nWhile Lovett did at least get to join his Large Band in the studio and record the basic tracks for \u201c12th of June,\u201d the pandemic had a huge effect on the work required from that point forward to finish the album.\n\n\u201cMy recording process is such that I\u2019m usually in the room for every playback and every change,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of making a record is getting to be in the room and getting to work (in person) with your producer and recording engineer \u2014 and with the musicians, of course, which I got to do on this one. But the post-production is a very important part of the record and a very important part of enjoying making a record. So I hope we don\u2019t ever have to make a record in isolation again.\u201d\n\nSo better late than never, fans of Lovett finally have new music to enjoy. And while Lovett, one of music\u2019s finest and most literate songwriters, has done his share of excellent albums that lean toward country and feature a good bit of acoustic instrumentation (like his second album, 1987\u2019s \u201cPontiac,\u201d 1992\u2019s \u201cJoshua Judges Ruth\u201d or even \u201cRelease Me\u201d), \u201c12th of June\u201d is his third studio album to be billed with his Large Band.\n\nWith this 14-member ensemble of talented musicians, Lovett is able to greatly expand his musical reach. That\u2019s obvious right from the start of the Chuck Ainlay-produced \u201c12th of June,\u201d which opens with a version of jazz great Horace Silver\u2019s \u201cCookin\u2019 at the Continental,\u201d a lively instrumental that lets the Large Band showcase their considerable chops. Three duets with Lovett\u2019s long-time vocal counterpart, Francine Reed, further cement the jazz credentials of all involved as they tackle two songs associated with Nat King Cole, the peppy \u201cStraighten Up & Fly Right,\u201d the bluesy ballad \u201cGee Baby, Ain\u2019t I Good To You,\u201d as well as the David Frishberg-panned standard \u201cPeel Me A Grape.\u201d\n\nLovett\u2019s more country-leaning sound emerges on the ballads \u201cHer Loving Man,\u201d \u201cThe Mocking Ones\u201d and the title track, while \u201cPig Meat Man\u201d puts a bit of soul and blues into the mix and \u201cAre We Dancing\u201d adds a string-laden ballad that is rooted in the pre-rock and roll era.\n\nThe long gap between \u201c12th of June\u201d and Lovett\u2019s previous album was largely the product of being between record deals and needing time to figure out how he wanted to release his next collection of songs, coupled with a major development in Lovett\u2019s personal life \u2013 his marriage to long-time girlfriend April Kimble in 2017, followed by the birth of the couple\u2019s twins, Will and Ella. Along with touring commitments \u2013 Lovett tends to play around 100 concerts during normal years \u2013 these factors absorbed a lot of time over the past decade.\n\nAs someone who always wanted to have kids, Lovett is relishing his life as a husband and father.\n\n\u201cI always imagined having children. Then I got to a point I thought I guess I probably won\u2019t have children,\u201d Lovett said. \u201cI always thought I wanted (kids), but I had no idea, I just had no idea how much I\u2019d enjoy it. It really has been a miraculous experience. I know other people have had children before. I\u2019m not the only one. But it does sort of feel that way when you\u2019re going through it yourself. It\u2019s just something that you have to experience to be able to understand what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nMarriage and fatherhood figure prominently into the lyrics of the original songs on \u201c12th of June.\u201d \u201cHer Loving Man\u201d is a sweet tribute to Kimble and her intelligence, wisdom and warmth. The title song is a touching tune that imagines a father carrying his love for his wife and children into the next life and also the twins\u2019 birthday. Lovett applies his trademark wry humor to \u201cPants is Overrated,\u201d which was inspired one day when his children were resisting the idea of getting dressed, and to \u201cPig Meat Man,\u201d an ode to pork.\n\n\u201cI did focus on these particular songs and wanted it really to represent this part of my life because it really is the main thing going on for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, of (the) subjects I can authentically represent, that (fatherhood) really is the best one right now. And it\u2019s important to me. I hope one day when my children are old enough to understand those songs and understand what they\u2019re about that they will take from that, that their dad loved them. That\u2019s all I really care about.\u201d\n\nLyle Lovett and His Large Band\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Wednesday, July 5\n\nWhere: The Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano Suite C, San Juan Capistrano\n\nTickets: Sold-out; All-ages.
