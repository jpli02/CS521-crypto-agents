        "title": "MATIC Token\u2019s Price Surges Amid Rising Transaction Activity - Coin Culture",
        "content": "The MATIC token, used by the Ethereum scaling tool Polygon, has increased in value by 12% in the previous day, following the year\u2019s upward trend.\n\nA share in MATIC cost about $1.11 as recently as a few days ago. Since December 31, it has increased by 48% as daily transactions have surged, making the blockchain the second largest in terms of DAU, according to Token Terminal.\n\nThe rally coincides with a general uptick in the cryptocurrency market when bitcoin rose over 40%, Aptos\u2019 APT token was up by over 400%, and the FTM token of Fantom surged by around 145% since early this year.\n\nPolygon is the most popular overall platform behind Binance\u2019s BNB chain, beating Solana and Ethereum.\n\nThe price rise may be due to a number of factors, including speculation about the mainnet launch of Polygon\u2019s zero knowledge-EVM and the company\u2019s recently announced collaborations and launches that have raised DAUs over the previous month. The timeline for the mainnet debut is early 2023. It launched its public testnet for zk-EVM in October.\n\nCharles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture, said they were beginning to see users and interest come back to these sorts of networks and see activity again. More action will be added after several companies built on top of Polygon haven\u2019t published their tokens yet do so.\n\nAccording to DeFi Llama, Polygon has a TVL of around $1.1 billion. Bulk TVL increases are occurring for riskier projects and early-stage applications. When prices are low, investors are wary of taking on too much risk, but now that they\u2019ve seen some improvement, they\u2019re willing to try out riskier ecosystems like Polygon.\n\nAs the market improves, more of it will start to trickle down."

Solana, a smaller digital token, has jumped by 145 per cent.\n\nThis rebound has largely been attributed to signs that inflation might have peaked, particularly in the US, potentially allowing global interest rates to peak at lower levels and paving the way for more \u201crisk-on\u201d investment strategies.\n\n\u201cThese were some of, if not the, worst performing ETFs in 2022, so they can bounce back sharply, in part, because bitcoin and other cryptos themselves have bounced back,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi.\n\n\u201cThis is why people invest in crypto,\u201d said Lamont. \u201cFor many of the investors who invest in crypto, it\u2019s effectively high stakes gambling. It\u2019s high risk and potentially high reward.\u201d\n\nWGMI has been the best-performing unleveraged equity ETF globally in the first few weeks of 2023, according to data from Morningstar Direct, although it is still down by two-thirds since inception in February 2022.\n\nIts largest holdings are cryptocurrency miners Bitfarms, Marathon Digital Holdings and Digihost Technology, which have seen their share prices surge by between 148 and 279 per cent since the start of January.\n\nThe VanEck Digital Assets Mining ETF (DAM) is not far off, with holdings such as crypto miners Riot Platforms and CleanSpark and Chinese computer hardware manufacturer Canaan helping to propel it to a 77 per cent gain.

        "title": "Better Buy: Cardano vs. Solana - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Down massively from their highs, which cryptocurrency is the better buy?\n\nCryptocurrency valuations have seen some pronounced recovery lately, but the broader crypto market still remains deep in bear market territory -- and many leading tokens are down precipitously from previous highs. Cardano's (ADA -0.35%) ADA token is trading down roughly 87% from its peak. Meanwhile, Solana's (SOL 0.06%) SOL token is trading off roughly 90% from its high.\n\nWhich of these cryptocurrencies is the better buy for investors gearing up for crypto's next bull phase? Read on for a look at pros and cons of investing in each token and a decision on which crypto stands the best chance of delivering explosive gains from current pricing levels.\n\nKey characteristics of Cardano and Solana\n\nCardano and Solana each provide layer-1 blockchain services and have set up their respective tokens as the fundamental currency for transacting on the networks. To some extent, that puts both projects in competition with Ethereum, which also provides layer-1 blockchain services. It also means that adoption and utilization of Cardano's and Solana's respective networks will likely be a driving force in shaping each cryptocurrency's performance.\n\nThus far, Cardano's Ouroboros proof-of-stake system has proven to be highly secure. Offering top-tier security is of foundation-level importance when it comes to attracting projects and scaling user engagement in the blockchain space. Due to its network structure and heavy emphasis on security, building and running applications on Cardano will typically be slower compared to Solana, which uses a proof-of-history system. Cardano does offer relatively low transaction costs, but transaction costs on the Solana network will usually be even cheaper.\n\nWhile Solana's speed and transaction-cost advantages potentially make its platform better for long-term scalability, those advantages become less significant if people aren't confident in the network's underlying security. Multiple projects on Solana have also suffered significant security breaches, and the network has seen outage periods when it was rendered inaccessible.\n\nWhile Solana can provide faster transaction speeds and lower costs than Cardano in many instances, thus far, the Cardano network has proven to be more secure and reliable. Offering quick and inexpensive transactions is a desirable characteristic for a layer-1 blockchain network, but security and reliability are paramount.\n\nSolana has other problems too\n\nThe implosion of controversial cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the fall from grace of its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried have cast a shadow over Solana. Bankman-Fried had been a major backer of Solana. He purchased large positions in the token through his companies and built projects on its network through his Alameda Research organization. Some have alleged that Bankman-Fried and his companies made moves to artificially increase the price of the SOL token.\n\nThe connection to Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX has already caused some developers and projects to leave the Solana network. At this stage in the game, when attracting developers and building trust is likely very important to building the foundations of long-term success, a resulting lack of confidence could prove to be devastating.\n\nMaking matters worse, much of Solana's previous activity growth had been a result of it gaining favor as a go-to network for non-fungible token (NFT) projects and transactions. But with NFTs having fallen out of favor, network activity has slumped. Ultimately, I don't see the NFT market recovering any time in the near future, and the significance these projects held in terms of overall usage on the Solana network doesn't bode well for the SOL token's pricing trajectory.\n\nCardano looks like the better buy\n\nUltimately, I think that Cardano stands out as the much better buy for investors who are aiming to build positions in anticipation of the next crypto bull market. Cardano's security advantages are the main reason I expect it to be the better performer, but recent events and sentiment shifts surrounding the Solana network also factor into this conclusion.\n\nEven more than equity valuations, crypto valuations are heavily sentiment-based, and Solana's connections to Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX represent a meaningful blemish that could also hurt the project's underlying fundamentals. The connection to the FTX scandal, whether tertiary or not, already appears to have caused some weakening in support for the Solana network.\n\nIt's highly likely that both tokens will continue to see their pricing action shaped by movements for the crypto market at large, but I think that Cardano's ADA token looks like the clear-cut better buy at today's prices."
