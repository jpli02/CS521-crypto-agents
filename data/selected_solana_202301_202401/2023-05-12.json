        "content": "The Shoppes At Solana is adding something new to their list of businesses in the west El Paso mall: Jungle Reef!\n\nJungle Reef is an Interactive Aquarium and it will be the first and only interactive aquarium in El Paso.\n\n\u201cIt will be an interactive aquarium, meaning you will be able to touch and feed and get close and personal with these animals,\u201d said business owners.\n\nThe interactive aquarium will take over the spot where Old Navy once was.\n\nI\u2019ve been to tons of Interactive Aquariums out of El Paso and I have always loved taking my son there so knowing that El Paso will finally have one of its own is exciting to hear! I won't have to travel far away to try something new.\n\nJungle Reef will have sharks, birds, stingrays, otters, reptiles and more. It will definitely be a destination location for families, friends, and school field trips.\n\nThe interactive aquarium is a family owned business. The Hepworth brother\u2019s have been in the construction business for over 20 years and are no stranger to opening up new and exciting businesses in Sunland Park Mall.\n\nMost recently, the brother\u2019s opened \u201cMonkey Rock\u201d which is an entertainment venue that has bowling, arcades, plus a full bar and restaurant.\n\nThey are excited to bring the community back together through the revitalization of an old retail space, and turn it into a destination.\n\n\u201cHaving such an entertaining facility will bring over 150,000 people annually through Sunland Park mall. This foot traffic has proven to bring back life to old empty spaces. We also feel that jobs created from this will help those that would otherwise never have the chance to work in an educational animal environment,\u201d said Jungle Reef owners.\n\nWhen Is Jungle Reef Expected to Open?\n\nJungle Reef will be located at 750 Shoppes At Solana.\n\nUpdates on opening day will all be worked out during construction period, but Jungle Reef owners have a tentative opening date for Jungle Reef during Spring 2024."

        "content": "Render Network (RNDR) announced a new technical roadmap that aims to bring the core of the network into the Solana\u2019s ecosystem, and the partnership with Metaplex is just the start. With an increase of 40% in a month, Collateral Network (COLT) demonstrates enormous potential for investors and with its unique and borderless business model. Collateral Network is set to change the way we lend and borrow forever.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nRender Network\u2019s Move to Solana\n\nRender Network has announced a new technical roadmap to bring the core of the network into the Solana ecosystem, with the partnership with Metaplex being just the start. RNDR goal has been to create a free and open metaverse since the creation of toolsets and infrastructure.\n\nIts core function is to distribute GPU resources across a distributed network of consumers to make it possible to access the computing power to build the metaverse at high scale and speed. Render Network chose Solana for its programmable and secure infrastructure, scalability, and possibilities.\n\nSolana\u2019s high TPS and low latency enable decentralization of core rendering processes, and Render Network is funding the development of open-source Rust GPU cross-compiler tools for the RNDR SDK to enable developers to use the Solana smart contract VM and Render Network GPU nodes.\n\nThis provides transparency into the rendering and computation processes, higher interoperability for computing on the blockchain, and underscores Render Network\u2019s commitment to building an open, freely accessible metaverse that is not threatened by centralized powers.\n\nAs of press time, the RNDR token is trading at $1.75 and has decreased by 8% in the last 24 hours.\n\nCollateral Network: Borderless Lending and Borrowing\n\nCollateral Network allows multiple lenders to earn passive income with a fixed interest rate by offering a decentralized Web3 lending platform that collateralizes real-world assets using NFTs. COLT issues asset-backed NFTs against physical assets such as property, gold, cars, art, jewelry, and more.\n\nBuilt on Ethereum, the blockchain technology ensures the security and transparency of the network and keeps participants in complete control of their investments. Collateral Network offers an easy-to-use and borderless marketplace for everyone, with decent interest rates and fair valuations. It is audited by SolidProof and Interfi Network, and team tokens are locked for 2 years, while liquidity tokens are locked for 33 years.\n\nCOLT is the native token of the ecosystem, and since the presale started in February 2023, COLT has already gained 40%. Collateral Network is the first of its kind and is built on Ethereum and will soon bridge to multiple blockchains to ensure fast TPs, low latency, and affordable network fees for the multi-ecosystem.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nConclusion\n\nRender Network is the go-to address for many of the leading crypto artists, with over $500 million in NFT sales in 2021 alone. Render has collaborations with Marvel and DC, Beeple, and Gene Roddenberry, to archive their work on the blockchain for future generations.\n\nIt enters an untapped market and offers fresh possibilities for would-be lenders and borrowers, by easing the process of lending. For the presale alone, gains of up to 35x are expected, with a possible 100x after listing on major exchanges. COLT is now available in presale at $0.014.\n\nCollateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nDisclaimer: Any information written in this press release or sponsored post does not constitute investment advice.

        "title": "Crypto Rollercoaster: Binance's Bullish Bounce and Solana's Steep Slide in Bearish Blitz - Securities.io",
        "content": "The crypto market continues to lose ground, with Bitcoin falling under $26,200 and Ethereum below $1,750 this week.\n\nThe low liquidity in the market seems to be driving the prices lower. Market depth or liquidity has been worsening even on major exchanges like Binance while two of the biggest institutional liquidity providers, Jane Street and Jump Crypto, dialed back their crypto-trading businesses in the US. This move from the market makers came amidst the country's regulators' continuing their crackdown on the industry. As such, with order books thinner, it now takes less capital to move an asset's price.\n\nAn absence of liquidity, which has been failing to recover since the collapse of FTX, combined with the highly-leveraged nature of the crypto market, can cause a significant increase in volatility. Additionally, if the US equities market takes a dump, then the collapsing market can see an acceleration on the downside.\n\nThese latest losses have the total cryptocurrency market cap down by 3.% in the past 24 hours at $1.14 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nWhile the combined market capitalization of all the coins in the crypto industry is up from the $820 billion low hit in Nov. 2022 as a result of the FTX collapse, it is still far off from the all-time high (ATH) a year prior to that when it surpassed $3 trillion.\n\nThis is because the majority of altcoins are down 80% to 90% from their peaks. And when it comes to majors, Bitcoin and Ether are down about 62% and 64% from their respective ATHs.\n\nBut among the top 20 crypto assets, there is one coin that has managed to do better than even BTC and ETH in sustaining its gains, while others have been hit far more brutally. So, let's take a look at them!\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nWhen it comes to the asset with the least percentage of downside from its ATH, BNB is the clear winner. The 4th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $47.7 billion has only lost about 56% of its value since its ATH of $686 hit on May 10, 2021.\n\nBNB is currently up 24.5% in 2023 so far and 32.3% in the past year while being down 7% in the past week. As of writing, BNB has been exchanging hands at $304.\n\nLately, BNB has been seeing some fresh accumulation among large institutional investors. While a group of whales with balances of 100,000 to one million BNB stopped selling, they added 90,000 BNB coins into their wallet balances.\n\nBNB is the native token of the largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which was founded by Changpeng Zhao, also known as \u201cCZ,\u201d in 2017. BNB holders get access to discounted fees on the platform. As such, demand for the token is linked to the exchange's usage and activity. This is why buying BNB can be seen as a bet on the exchange's success.\n\nIn April, the spot trading volume of Binance plummeted by 48%, marking the second consecutive month of declines and recording its second-lowest monthly trading volume since 2021, as per CCData's latest Exchange Review report.\n\nIn addition, Binance's market share kept on sliding, falling for the second consecutive month to 46.3%, its lowest since October 2022, prior to FTX's collapse. Despite this, Binance is still dominating the industry with a huge lead over its competitors.\n\nBNB was actually created to raise capital through an ICO in 2017, during which Binance sold 100 million BNB at a price of 2,700 BNB for 1 ETH. As per its original whitepaper, Binance proposed spending 20% of its profits every quarter buying and burning BNB, essentially removing coins from circulation, until the volume was brought down to 100 million. As of May 2023, the volume in circulation is around 157 million BNB, according to CoinGecko.\n\nOriginally, BNB was launched on the Ethereum blockchain but later migrated to its own blockchain called BNB Chain, which was launched in April 2019. The old tokens were destroyed and created on the new chain in equivalent numbers during this migration.\n\nBNB Chain is a layer 1 network that allows other applications to be built on top of it. It offers a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum, but it is more centralized. BNB token is also used to pay transaction fees on the blockchain. Besides its primary centralized exchange, Binance also has a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the BNB Chain.\n\nBNB Chain uses a proof-of-stake authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism under which it has a small number of the largest stakers as validators.\n\nBNB's gains in 2021 were the result of the growing popularity and a thriving ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), including DeFi and NFT on BSC.\n\nAt the time, the total value locked (TVL) in BSC went to almost $22 billion, as per DeFi Llama. This activity has since slowed down tremendously, with TVL currently standing at $4.51 billion \u2014 the third largest after Ethereum ($26.54 bln) and Tron ($5.31 bln).\n\nAccording to recent on-chain indicators, the BNB Chain has also been gaining market share. Over the past week, the number of Daily Active Users (DAU) on the network increased by 27%, from 4,068 to 5,148. DAU metric measures the number of unique wallet addresses interacting on a blockchain.\n\nBesides being a utility token, BNB also acts as a governance token for the BNB chain, allowing holders to participate in some of the project's decision-making. It is further in demand for staking on the BNB Chain.\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nOnce a coveted cryptocurrency and one of the top-performing assets of the 2021 crypto bull run, SOL has suffered the most among the top 20 crypto assets, even worse than meme coins. The 10th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $7.96 billion, is currently trading at $20.18, having lost just over 92% of its value since its ATH of almost $260 on Nov. 6, 2021.\n\nHowever, SOL is performing well in 2023 with gains of 102% YTD, the highest among the top 30 coins. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency is down 7.7% in the past week and 54.3% in the past year.\n\nSOL is the native token of the Solana blockchain, which was founded by software engineer Anatoly Yakovenko in 2017. Those who invested in the project include Multicoin Capital, BlockTower Capital, Distributed Global, NEO Global Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange Ventures, Slow Ventures, Rockaway Ventures, and Passport Capital.\n\nLaunched in March 2020, Solana is a layer 1 platform that has fast transaction times and inexpensive fees. The token is used to pay transaction fees as well as to run smart contracts on the network.\n\nIt is an inflationary cryptocurrency with no hard cap on the total number of tokens. As of May 2023, about 395 million SOL tokens are in circulation. SOL has a starting annual inflation rate of 8%, which decreases by 15% every year until it reaches 1.5%, which will be the fixed long-term rate.\n\nSolana is secured through the popular proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where validators are tasked with ensuring transactions are valid. To become a validator and help secure the network, people can stake \u201csome of their SOL. And in exchange for locking their tokens up, holders earn rewards. Validators are chosen based on how many SOL tokens they own.\n\nIn addition to PoS, Solana also uses proof-of-history, which is its core advancement and aims to speed up the process of ordering transactions in a blockchain. This mechanism is used to prove that an event has happened at a particular time.\n\nA competitor to Ethereum, Solana also offers a way to build dApps and currently has $263 million in TVL. This value has fallen considerably since it peaked at just above $10 bln in late 2021 but jumped 23.5% Quarter over Quarter (QoQ) this year.\n\nThe blockchain, which is known for offering users fast, secure, and scalable infrastructure for DeFi and NFT, experienced substantial growth in Q1 of 2023. When it comes to the NFT sector of the ecosystem, daily new NFTs on Solana surged from 2.6 Million to 2.9 Million QoQ, and NFT sales volume in the secondary market denominated in USD increased by almost 36%. Moreover, the network saw 96,000 unique active programs in 1Q23 compared to 58,000 in 1Q22.\n\nMeanwhile, the overall earnings of Solana declined by 17.9% in the last 30 days, according to the token terminal. The number of code commits, however, continued to increase on GitHub. This growth comes after turbulent times during which the blockchain saw a large number of downtimes and various prominent NFTs migrating to other protocols.\n\nWhile Solana has seen the most amount of losses during the last two years of the bear market, some coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot (DOT), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are not far behind with losses of 90.4%, 90.3%, and 90% respectively.\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Solana (SOL)."
