        "title": "SOL would trade at this price if Solana hits its all-time high market cap - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Crypto traders and investors often overlook the tokenomics of cryptocurrencies\u2019 supply inflation. Understanding this offers competitive advantages in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWith that in mind, Finbold looked at Solana (SOL) tokenomics from a different perspective. Public market data from leading indexes can demonstrate the effects of an increased supply inflation. It is possible to calculate the exact price SOL would trade if it ever hits the all-time high market cap.\n\nA token needs more demand to keep its same value, facing an inflationary supply. These two factors influence whether a cryptocurrency\u2019s price rises or falls. Each cryptocurrency, including Solana, has its unique \u2018tokenomics\u2019 structure.\n\nSolana had an all-time high market cap of $80.965 billion on November 8, 2021, according to TradingView\u2019s CRYPTOCAP index.\n\nMeanwhile, the token traded for as high as $260.06 two days before, as registered by CoinMarketCap. An inverse calculation suggests a circulating supply of around 311.332 million SOL at that time.\n\nCRYPTOCAP \u2013 SOL daily market capitalization. Source: TradingView\n\nSolana supply inflation and its economic effects\n\nLet\u2019s explore SOL\u2019s supply inflation and its economic implications. As of this writing, Solana has a circulating supply of 423.139 million SOL. This results in a supply inflation of 111.807 million SOL (36%) in two years, or around 18% a year \u2014 higher than XRP\u2019s yearly inflation.\n\nSolana supply. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe price projection also shows the massive economic effects of this inflation. In case the leading Ethereum competitor reaches its highest speculative demand of $80.965 billion market cap, SOL would trade at a proportionally lower price than the corresponding all-time high.\n\nConsidering the circulating supply on November 23, Solana would be priced at $191.34 per token at its highest capitalization. Interestingly, a loss of $68.72 (26.4%) from the previous price of $260.06 in 2021.\n\nHowever, this still indicates a potential 235% increase from the current price of $57.08.\n\nIt is important to understand that the forecast requires the same demand as 2021 for Solana. In this context, there are no guarantees that this demand will ever be seen again. On the other hand, it is also possible that a higher demand surges in the following years.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Solana Price Prediction: SOL Retesting Lifeline Support To Confirm 17% Breakout? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Solana Price Prediction shines a light on the competitive smart contracts token bowing to selling pressure just like the majority of altcoins amid a strengthening Bitcoin (BTC) dominance \u2014 currently at 51.3%. The recent bullish outlook took another significant setback amid the developments at the largest exchange, Binance.\n\nAs reported, the former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao resigned on Tuesday, paving the way for Richard Teng following the firm\u2019s $4.3 billion settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ).\n\nadvertisement\n\nCZ, as he is commonly referred to in the crypto world, resigned and on top of that pleaded guilty to breaking US anti-money laundering rules. He will no longer hold any executive positions at the company but was allowed to keep his stake.\n\nDue to the uncertainty in the market, Solana price extended the correction to test the support at $54. If successfully tested and a rebound follows, there is a high probability that SOL will make a bigger breakout.\n\nRecommended for you: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Resilient Above $2k After Fed Minutes, Is The Bull Run Intact?\n\nSolana Price Prediction: SOL Prepares For Falling Wedge Breakout\n\nOn top of the immediate support at $54, Solana holds between the 100 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue) and the 50 EMA (red). Consolidation is expected to take place within this range, with movement above the resistance at $56.58 likely to lead to another 17% breakout to $66.\n\nFalling wedges are bullish patterns that allow an asset to consolidate before resuming the uptrend. With the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator about to send a buy signal, traders can consider preparing to long SOL.\n\nTraders like @CryptoBusy believe that Solana could provide more opportunities to profit. This means that those interested in short-term gains should DCA as long as support at $54 holds. While a recovery above $60 to $70 could follow, gains past $70 would be a bonus.\n\n$SOL trade quick take profit has been activated! \u2705 Shared this 24 hours ago. \ud83d\udcb0 Looks like the market just wants us to profit, then it bounces back up from the support!

The RSI, now with a strength of 73, has corrected from highs around 83.\n\nIf this pullback continues, Solana may not be able to immediately resume the uptrend. In such a case, a consolidation could follow with support at $50 coming in handy.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Activity on Solana increased, resulting in higher revenue for the network.\n\nTechnical indicators suggest that SOL may rise above $60.\n\nIn the last 30 days, the Solana [SOL] protocol\u2019s fees have increased by 103%, according to AMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of Token Terminal\u2019s dashboard. For instance, the fees recorded on 22nd November were $131,100.\n\nA few days before that, on 14th November in particular, Solana\u2019s total fees were $99,724.\n\nMore fees, no downside\n\nSolana fees are set by the network, and it depends on congestion and historical throughput. About 50% of each transaction fee is burned while the rest goes to the validators processing the transactions.\n\nDespite having cheaper transaction fees compared to Ethereum, the hike in the amount means that there has been a lot of activity on the Solana network.\n\nThis assumption was confirmed by the number of daily active users, which increased by 132$ within the same period the fees climbed.\n\nWith respect to the SOL price, the broader market recovery helped it reclaim $58.16 in the last 24 hours. But before the hike, MS2 Capital mentioned that the$57.55 level could be decisive for SOL.\n\nAccording to the web3 venture accelerator, Low-Frequency Trading (LFT) could spell doom for the token, with a possible drop to $46.48. The handle also mentioned that High-Frequency Trading (HFT) could help SOL increase its gains.\n\n#Solana Ecosystem Update$SOL/ $USD 2D\ud83d\udcca \ud83d\udcc8 \u2013 SOL reclaiming $57.55 HTF target\ud83c\udfaf(3.618 fib) would signal upside \u26a0\ufe0f \u2013 $57.55 HTF price becomes LTF resistance \u2013 could signal downside to previous MTF\ud83c\udfaf \ud83d\udcc9- SOL is unable to find support at MTF level $46.48 \ud83d\udcb0- $SOL \ud83d\udcc8452.9% YTD https://t.co/4VNiMAejME pic.twitter.com/3ePsakwySV \u2014 MS2 Capital (@ms2capital) November 22, 2023\n\nAs opposed to HFT, LFT means that few trades are taken over a cycle because traders are opening long-term positions.\n\nOn the other hand, HFT signals a surge in the number of large transactions executed in seconds.\n\nSOL looks to the sky\n\nIn the end, SOL chose the HFT as the cryptocurrency was characterized by a high order-to-trade ratio. Furthermore, the SOL/USD 4-hour chart buying pressure has been dominating the scenes since 22nd November.\n\nAlso, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 54.54. RSI reading above 50 is a sign that SOL\u2019s uptrend could continue.\n\nHowever, the potential price increase would depend on increasing buying momentum.\n\nShould the RSI reading continue to rise, then SOL may retest $62. At the time of writing, the Aroon Up (orange) was 85.71% while the Aroon Down (blue) was 42.86%.\n\nThis is a sign that a new uptrend could be underway, and if the Aroon Down falls below 30%, it would confirm that bias.\n\nBut that would only be the case as long as the Aroon Up remains above 70%. If that\u2019s the case, bulls may find potentially profitable entries around $58 to $60 while targeting a mid-term upside.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nGoing forward, the Solana price may continue to build up on its recent recovery.\n\nShould the buying momentum continue to increase, then SOL\u2019s chances of hitting $70 might become more feasible."

        "content": "Solana and Shiba Inu have caught the attention of market analysts with their bullish price movements. Analysts have forecasted more price gains in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, the Everlodge project has caught the attention of investors as many look for ways to invest in real estate properties.\n\nSolana (SOL) DEXs Trading Volume Skyrockets\n\nAccording to DeFi intelligence tracker DeFiLlama, the Solana DEXs experienced a 54% surge in trading volume over the past week. This exceeded $3 billion in total trade volume, a record high for Solana. Leading DEXs on Solana, like Orca and Raydium, grew by 70%.\n\nConsequently, Solana\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) has risen by 42% between November 1st and 20th, as shown by DeFiLlama. Despite this increased activity, Solana\u2019s price has not seen significant gains. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of Solana has dropped from a 7-day high of $67.50 to $54.6\n\nNevertheless, Solana\u2019s price chart still shows gains of 49.3% and 113.0% in the weekly and monthly charts. Analysts forecasted a jump to $72 in the coming weeks.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Has Released a New Feature for Shibarium\n\nThe Shibarium development team introduced the \u201cDonate\u201d feature on November 19th. Ragnar Shib, a well-known figure within the Shiba Inu community, shared this news on the X platform.\n\nThis new feature\u2019s primary purpose is to allow the Shibarium community to make financial contributions to non-profit validators. These validators play a vital role in ensuring the network\u2019s efficiency and security.\n\nShiba Inu coin has been trading between the $0.00000819 to $0.00000908 price range in the past week. Analysts and traders remain bullish about a positive Shiba Inu crypto price prediction.\n\nEverlodge Has Captured Traders\u2019 Interest With Real Estate Properties\n\nWhile Solana and Shiba Inu have caught the attention of analysts, Everlodge (ELDG) has emerged as the go-to project for real estate enthusiasts. Everlodge serves as a marketplace where traders have the opportunity to become fractional or full owners of high-end properties. Examples of such properties are hotels, villas, and luxury homes.\n\nIn practical terms, Everlodge will transform these villas and hotels into NFTs. Then, they will be divided into smaller ownership shares. One unique feature of these NFTs is that they reflect the value of the actual properties. For traders seeking short to medium-term loans, Everlodge has a lending feature.\n\nTraders no longer have to battle with conventional banks for loans. They can easily use their NFTs as collateral to secure fast loans. Everlodge has a native token called ELDG. Its appeal lies in its tangible benefits and usefulness in the real world. By holding ELDG tokens, users gain access to discounts on properties within the Everlodge marketplace.\n\nCurrently, the Everlodge token is priced at $0.025. Many traders are eagerly acquiring ELDG tokens. This enthusiasm is primarily driven by the token\u2019s practical applications. Another factor is its link to the $280 trillion real estate industry.\n\nVisit Everlodge Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Solana is known for its efficiency and scalability. It operates as a layer-1 protocol, allowing the processing of thousands of transactions per second while minimizing fees. This feature addresses the challenges that other blockchain protocols face.\n\nIn 2022, SOL, Solana\u2019s native currency, had a turbulent year due to external factors. However, it has rebounded, rising by 500%. Currently, over 70% of all circulating SOL are staked.\n\nFocus on Solana in 2024\n\nSolana\u2019s commitment to high-throughput, low-latency transactions highlights its significance in 2024.\n\nIts architecture has attracted diverse projects, including decentralized finance (defi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This year, Solana is expected to achieve significant breakthroughs within its ecosystem.\n\nIt\u2019s an opportune time to explore some of the top projects on Solana that are redefining decentralized technologies.\n\nThe below projects showcase Solana\u2019s versatility and role as a catalyst for broader adoption of decentralized technology.\n\n1. Crowny (CRWNY)\n\nCrowny is a web3 loyalty and rewards platform that onboards businesses through e-commerce plugins (e.g., Shopify) and directly onboards their users.\n\nUsers can use Crowny\u2019s native app to earn loyalty points and CRWNY for interacting, purchasing, and engaging with their favorite brands.\n\nThe platform launched in 2021 and was one of the first movers on Solana, receiving early grants from leading ecosystem participants.\n\nCrowny has untapped potential use cases for web3, such as loyalty and SocialFi, which can benefit both B2B and B2C efforts.\n\nThe fully vested CRWNY, currently with a market cap of $4m, has a real utility that helps businesses quickly reach their fans and achieve more through their loyalty solution without the hassle of dealing with crypto.\n\n2. JITO\n\nAs one of Solana\u2019s leading Solana MEV infrastructure providers and liquid staking option, JITO has nearly 6 million staked SOL, over 34,000 holders, 77 validators, and an APY of 6.71%.\n\nYou might also like: Tether whale received $1.1b USDT since October, buoying bullish speculation\n\nJITO is a platform that allows SOL holders to earn a yield on their assets while maintaining flexibility. Users can access liquidity on their staked SOL and use it in defi while controlling their funds completely.\n\nCompared to Ethereum, liquid staking on Solana is relatively tiny.\n\n3. Raydium (RAY)\n\nRaydium, one of the leading defi protocols on Solana, recently announced the launch of Raydium V3 open-beta, an optimized dapp for speed and efficiency.\n\nRaydium\u2019s trading volume has been rising in sync with expanding SOL prices, pointing to growing demand for decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nYou might also like: Lido DAO discovered a security vulnerability in Ethereum protocol\n\nThe platform also has one of the highest total value locked (TVL) on Solana, putting it ahead of competitors such as Jupiter, which has announced airdrop campaigns.\n\nRaydium V3 has improved user flows and enhanced tooling, reflecting the company\u2019s commitment to setting new standards in defi.\n\n4. Solana FM\n\nSolana FM aims to redefine the Solana exploration experience via a user-friendly interface.\n\nThe platform recently announced the upcoming launch of Quantum, a new explorer with an improved interface. Quantum promises to eliminate the frustration of clunky Solana transactions, manual search entries, and endless scrolling.\n\nYou might also like: KyberSwap suffers multichain exploit, resulting in $45m loss\n\nEarly Access slots will allow users to experience features firsthand, reflecting Solana FM\u2019s user-centric approach to exploration on Solana.\n\n5. GenesysGo (SHDW)\n\nGenesysGo provides blockchain developers and operators with a secure infrastructure to enhance performance. It utilizes shdwDrive and the SHDW utility token.\n\nThe platform and underlying smart contract network aim to expand Solana\u2019s infrastructure while increasing decentralization and censorship resistance.\n\nTheir live testnet, D.A.G.G.E.R., focuses on marketing and improved visibility. In 2024, it, shdwDrive, and the SHDW will feature at crypto events.\n\nThe activation of shdwDrive and D.A.G.G.E.R.\u2019s multi-chain capabilities is crucial for the project. shdwDrive\u2019s chain-agnostic design broadens its data storage services to users on various chains, while D.A.G.G.E.R. takes on roles as an Oracle network and a Wormhole.\n\nThe cross-chain liquidity integration with SHDW\u2019s tokenomics can increase the token\u2019s utility.\n\nThe introduction of Auditor Nodes, powered exclusively by mobile devices, allows users to earn SHDW by using smartphones to solve mathematical proofs, transforming them into mobile mining rigs.\n\nThis concept provides a pathway for individuals to join the SHDW ecosystem. The approach positions D.A.G.G.E.R. and shdwDrive as pioneers in functionality and inclusivity in the blockchain.\n\nRead more: UK treasury secretary unveils new law to strengthen digital asset industry"
