Just in time for \u201cSlurpee Day\u201d (July 11, or 7/11), global convenience store franchise 7-Eleven is launching free Slurpee NFTs on the Polygon network.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for new and creative ways to celebrate with our customers on our favorite day of the year,\" Marissa Jarratt, 7-Eleven Executive Vice President, and Chief Marketing & Sustainability Officer, said in a press release.\n\nAvailable only via mobile devices, the sugary collectible game features a virtual 7-Eleven Slurpee cup and four flavors: Cherry, Blue Raspberry, Pina Colada, and Summertime Citrus.\n\n\"Maybe you\u2019ll even give us some inspiration for future flavors,\u201d Jarratt said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCollectors can choose any or all flavors in no particular order and create the Slurpee of their (and their dentist's) dreams.\n\nyou know the drill, go get yours \ud83e\udd64https://t.co/QXyKLVwzCd \u2014 Avery (@avery_akkineni) July 11, 2023\n\nAfter filling the cup to the top, the next screen gives the collector a choice to claim their \"Slurpee Vibe Digital Collectible,\" or to go back to the previous screen to start over.\n\nIf satisfied with their creation, the collector can select \"claim now\" and move to the next screen, which asks for the collector's name, email address, and telephone number. A six-digit code will be emailed to the collector to claim the Slurpee NFT.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe digital collectible and a new wallet on the Polygon blockchain will be created to hold the Slurpee token.\n\nConsidered by some to be a dirty word, NFTs are not mentioned in the Slurpee app. Instead, the term \"digital collectible\" is used. The only reference to non-fungible tokens is in the app\u2019s terms of service.\n\nNon-fungible tokens, better known as NFTs, are cryptographically unique tokens linked to digital (and sometimes physical) content, providing proof of ownership.\n\nUnlike traditional NFTs where the holder is the owner and can do as they please with the collectible, the 7-Eleven 'Find Your Slurpee Vibe' collectibles are merely licensed to the collector, are not stored or transferred, and can not be sold or transferred to a third party, according to the terms of service.\n\nLast month, snack brand Slim Jim launched a collection of NFTs on Polygon, \"GigaJims,\" a collection of 10,000 free digital collectibles. In 2021, both Taco Bell and Burger King experimented in the space. Other brands looking to leverage blockchain technology and NFTs include Chick-Fil-A, Toyota, and drug maker, Pfizer."

        "content": "Thriving in the fast-paced realm of cryptocurrency, trading demands swift decision-making abilities.

By immersing yourself in this detailed analysis, meme coin enthusiasts and investors will gain invaluable insights to inform their investment decisions.\n\nIs It Time To Let Milady Rest?\n\nMilady Meme Coin, symbolised as LADYS, gained initial popularity among meme coin enthusiasts due to its intriguing concept and catchy branding.

In a recent report, Santiment analysts have suggested that holders of SOL pay close attention to a potential rally in the altcoin in the near future. As on-chain indicators slowly shift towards bullish territory and historical patterns reemerge, it\u2019s essential for SOL holders to remain watchful.\n\nCan Big Eyes Coin Continue To Hook Investors\u2019 Attention?\n\nBig Eyes Coin is a newly launched cryptocurrency combining meme coins\u2019 appeal with practical utility.

        "title": "Best Crypto to Buy Now 11 July \u2013 Mina Protocol, Compound, Solana - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Best Crypto to Buy Now 11 July \u2013 Mina Protocol, Compound, Solana\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies are trading with a modestly positive bias on Tuesday, but are still mostly within recent ranges ahead of Wednesday\u2019s key US inflation data.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was last trading up around 1% in the last 24 hours in the $30,600 area, while ether (ETH) was last around $1,870.\n\nPositive reporting in the crypto press regarding BlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application could be acting as a mild tailwind for sentiment.\n\nReports allege that BlackRock\u2019s application goes beyond the surveillance of spot trading to also include an agreement to share exchange user data with regulators, should they so request it.\n\nThis could further boost the likelihood that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the Wall Street giant\u2019s ETF application.\n\nFor crypto investors keen to diversify their holdings away from blue-chip names like bitcoin and ether, here are some of the best coins to consider buying on Tuesday.\n\nMina Protocol (MINA)\n\nMINA, the native token that powers the zk-SNARKs-powered Mina Protocol blockchain, continues to trend to the downside within the confines of a bearish trend channel that has been in play since February.\n\nMINA/USD was last in the $0.45s, reversing back under its 21 and 50-Day Moving Averages after probing multi-week highs in the $0.52 area earlier in the session.\n\nWhilst MINA\u2019s technical outlook remains bearish, if the cryptocurrency is able to break out of its bearish trendline, it could see substantial medium-term gains, hence why it could be a good crypto to buy.\n\nDeeLance (DLANCE)\n\nAn innovative new web3 project called DeeLance is building a crypto and NFT-powered metaverse that, in an industry first, puts the jobs market on the blockchain.\n\nThe project, which is touted as one of 2023\u2019s hottest crypto start-ups, is building a metaverse to unite freelancers and employers and promises to overhaul remote working forever, as well as the $761 billion-dollar recruitment sector.\n\nUsing the decentralization and transparency of the blockchain, DeeLance wants to remove overly powerful middlemen like Fiverr and Upwork that have been abusing freelance workers and employers alike for the last decade.\n\nDeeLance is already generating huge hype in web3 circles and some observers think could upend the still very web2 platform-centric freelance/gig work economy.\n\nThe project has already raised a whopping near $1.5 million in just a few months since the launch of its $DLANCE token presale.\n\nDeeLance also recently secured a huge $1.12 million strategic investment from top venture capital firm Bitgert Ventures, a sign that institutions are increasingly taking note of the project\u2019s potential.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to move quickly to secure tokens, as when the presale hits $1.7 million, the price will rise from its current super-cheap $0.038 level.\n\nGiven that DLANCE will debut on major cryptocurrency exchanges later this year at $0.57, investors who get in now can be sat on gains of around 50%.\n\nAdding to the excitement is a massive $500K $DLANCE token giveaway competition that DeeLance is conducting.\n\nThe top five wallets that buy the most $DLANCE between now and the end of presale stage four will be rewarded with a share of $500K worth of $DLANCE tokens.\n\n$DLANCE can be bought using ETH, BNB and USDT (the ERC-20 and BEP-20 variants).\n\nBuy DLANCE Here\n\nCompound (COMP)\n\nCompound (COMP), the token that powers the Compound Finance decentralized finance (DeFi) lending/borrowing protocol, is pumping again on Tuesday.\n\nCOMP was last up close to 10% on the session above $65 per token as the bulls eye a retest of yearly highs above $70.\n\nA break above this key resistance zone would open the door to a swift rally towards the next major resistance zone at $93, meaning near-term gains in the region of 40% are highly possible.\n\nWall Street Memes (WSM)\n\nWall Street Memes, one of the internet\u2019s hottest retail investing communities, rose to prominence in the meme stock craze of 2021 and has recently been expanding its relevance in the cryptocurrency space with the presale of its new $WSM token.\n\nThe success of the $WSM presale, which has raised more than $14 million in just over one month, isn\u2019t surprising given the size of Wall Street Memes\u2019 community.\n\nNot only are there 523k hyper-engaged community members on its wallstbets Instagram account, there are another 214k on Twitter and more than 100k across its two other Instagram channels, wallstgonewild and wallstbullsnft.\n\nAll told, Wall Street Memes has a 1 million-strong social community of degens, which analysts think all but guarantees that the $WSM token will be listed on tier 1 crypto exchanges like Binance.\n\nWith 30% of the token supply being held back for community rewards, it can reasonably be expected that airdrops to holders will be a big part of the ecosystem.\n\nIndeed, the first $WSM airdrop is open now.\n\nAnalysts are already predicting big things for Wall Street Memes when it lists on exchanges and you can be a part of it.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes Here\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nWith Solana having recovered back to over 66% versus its post-SEC FUD lows around $13 per token to the $22 region, things are looking technically bullish for the cryptocurrency.\n\nSOL, which powers the high-performance smart-contract-enabled Solana layer-1 blockchain, recently broke to the north of a long-term downtrend.\n\nBulls are now targeting a test of key long-term resistance levels around $26-27, $39 and $48.\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto
