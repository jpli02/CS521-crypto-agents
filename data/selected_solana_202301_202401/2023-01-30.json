        "content": "A trader who continues to build a large following with his timely altcoin calls says that one of Ethereum\u2019s biggest competitors may be following ETH\u2018s early stages of growth.\n\nPseudonymous trader Cantering Clark shares a chart with his 159,000 Twitter followers showing uncanny similarities between the price action of Solana (SOL) today and Ethereum\u2019s in 2018.\n\n\u201cEarly ETH vs SOL.\u201d\n\nThe trader\u2019s chart shows both assets bouncing off a support level mutiple times, then collapsing through it before making a lower low and then a rebound.\n\nFrom its 2018 low, Ethereum ultimately rallied 5,777% to its all-time high, from $83 to $4,878. With Solana\u2019s recent low of $8, a similar move for SOL would suggest a rally to roughly to $462 before the next bear market.\n\nLooking at the rest of crypto markets, Cantering Clark says that the \u201cJanuary effect,\u201d referring to cypto\u2019s tendency to rally at the beginning of the year, is likely over. He predicts a correction in the near term, potentially triggered by poor earnings reports or other macroeconomic announcements.\n\n\u201cThe January effect is done. Historically big months like this follow with some mean reversion, and what better way to start the next month with a gamut of events: FOMC and earnings for Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Exxon, Pfizer, Merck\u2026\n\nIf I had to guess.\n\nTake it back to 20k area, and chop people up left and right before continuing.\u201d\n\nThe trader says BTC lacks a lot of liquidity between $23,000 and about $21,000 which could mean price falls rather quickly until the next major level.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care to do anything aggressive while Bitcoin is at the top of the range.\n\nFlipping 25k might change my mind.\n\nThere are some really imbalanced areas that price likes to revisit and could cut through like butter.\n\nEyes on anchored yearly vwap (volume weighted average price) and Jan 23rd low.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
