        "title": "Solana NFT Sales Overtake Ethereum for the First Time Ever in December - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Solana NFT Sales Overtake Ethereum for the First Time Ever in December\n\nSolana's NFT sales volume surpassed that of Ethereum in December 2023, marking the first time this has occurred. According to data from CryptoSlam, Solana's NFT sales reached approximately $366.5 million, while Ethereum's sales totaled $353.2 million.\n\nWhen excluding wash trades, Solana's sales remained strong at $366.5 million, nearly matching its all-time high of $373.5 million set in October 2021. In contrast, Ethereum's sales were relatively flat, with December's total being comparable to November's $350 million.\n\nFurthermore, Solana saw an increased number of unique traders, with around 218,000 unique sellers and 279,000 buyers. That is nearly double the number of unique traders compared to Ethereum.\n\nThe surge in Solana's NFT sales may be attributed to the significant rise in the value of its native token, SOL, which has more than quadrupled in price over the past three months. This has also led to the resurgence of the Solana ecosystem, coupled with a memecoin frenzy led by Bonk (BONK).\n\nThe influx of users and transactions on Solana may be driven by broader momentum around the network and the hype surrounding specific projects offering potential airdrops and other perks. Projects like Tensorians and Mad Lads generated substantial trading volume in December, contributing to Solana's overall success.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin jumps above $45,000 for first time since April 2022; Solana rises 10% - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) surged above the $45,000 mark on Tuesday for the first time since April 2022, fuelled by market expectations for the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs.Bitcoin touched a 21-month peak of $45,488, having gained nearly 155% last year in the strongest performance since 2020. BTC was last up 6.9% at $45,264 but remains far off the record high of $69,000 it touched in November 2021. Meanwhile, the second largest crypto, Ethereum rose 4.9% to $2,386.\"Bitcoin started the new year by surpassing the US$45,000 level, driven by market expectations for the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. A sustained bullish momentum could propel BTC to US$46,300 and subsequently US$47,600; however, if not, the support level is pegged at US$43,700,\" said Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex.Investor focus has been squarely on whether the US securities regulator will soon approve a spot Bitcoin ETF , which would open up the Bitcoin market to millions of investors.Other popular altcoins, such as Solana and Avalanche, rose 9% and 10%, respectively. XRP , Cardano, Dogecoin , Polkadot, Chainlink, and Shiba Inu surged 3-7%.The global cryptocurrency market cap rose 6.02% to around $1.74 trillion in the last 24 hours.The total volume in DeFi is currently $7.43 billion, 12.62% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $50.74 billion, which is 86.21% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.Bitcoin's dominance is currently 50.94%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 56% to $26.3 billion.\"BTC successfully surpassed a significant resistance at $44,500, now aiming for new resistance levels at $45,800 and $48,000. The previous resistance at $44,500 could act as a support, providing confirmation of the bullish trend through a retest,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.\"While ETH has been relatively slow in recent days, it continues to establish new higher highs. The real momentum for ETH is expected to pick up once BTC stabilizes. Technically, ETH needs to clear the resistance level at $2,450 to initiate a strong upward movement,\" it said.Bitcoin's recent rally has placed it at $44,700, breaking above previously discussed resistance levels. The cryptocurrency's positive momentum challenges the bearish outlook presented yesterday and is now trading comfortably above the critical $42,965 level.A break of the resistance points at $43,857, $44,679 and $45,962 signals potential strength in the uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 39 previously indicated caution, but recent price gains add optimism.Despite staying below the 50-day EMA, now at $42,983, Bitcoin's ability to resist a bearish engulfing pattern near $42,985 suggests resilience. The ascending trendline support at $41,750 remains a crucial defence, shaping a more bullish near-term outlook amid evolving market momentum."

        "content": "We do the research, you get the alpha! Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game! Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt\u2019s a new year, but airdrop season is continuing at full force into 2024. The latest: Dymension, a network for deploying app chains called \u201cRollApps,\u201d has revealed a token drop for more than a million crypto users across various chains and projects.\n\nDymension is a layer-1 blockchain built on Cosmos and the inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) to enable connections across various rollup scaling networks. \u201cDymension standardizes rollups with IBC, similar to how tokens were standardized with ERC,\u201d Dymension wrote on Twitter (aka X), referring to Ethereum\u2019s token standards.\n\nThe network lets RollApp creators choose which virtual machine and token to use, and can publish data to external chains like Celestia or Avail. Dymension CEO and co-founder Yishay Harel told Decrypt that the L1 network uses Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) addresses.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dymension revealed its \u201cgenesis rolldrop,\u201d which offers up DYM tokens to eligible users until January 21. United States residents cannot participate in the airdrop. However, a wide array of other crypto users are eligible for the airdrop, with some 70 million DYM tokens (7% of the supply) being offered up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStarting today, over one million addresses have the opportunity to participate in Dymension\u2019s Genesis Rolldrop! Eligible participants can claim up to 70M DYM (7% of total supply), the native asset of Dymension, until 21 January 2024, 12:00 UTC \u2014 Dymension (@dymension) January 2, 2024\n\nFull details are available in this blog post, but eligible users include those who staked the TIA token in Celestia as of December 19, 2023, along with users of Ethereum layer-2 networks Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and the upcoming Blast based on certain criteria.\n\nCosmos Hub and Stride users who meet certain eligibility can also claim DYM tokens, along with users of the Osmosis decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\nMore than 500,000 Solana users are also eligible, according to the post, including addresses that have used protocols like cross-chain bridge Wormhole, leading NFT marketplace Tensor, and NFT distribution platform Drip.Haus.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdditionally, owners of Pudgy Penguins, Mad Lads, Tensorians, and Bad Kids NFTs can also claim an allotment of DYM tokens. Pudgy Penguins is minted on Ethereum, Mad Lads and Tensorians are on Solana, and Bad Kids is on the Cosmos-based Stargaze chain.\n\nLastly, following the genesis airdrop, Dymension has proposed allocating a further 2.5 million DYM to users who bridge funds to the chain from other networks. Eligible tokens include USDC, TIA, USDT, ATOM, ETH, and SOL, with that program expected to begin about a week following the upcoming Dymension airdrop launch.\n\nDymension joins a growing list of networks and projects that are dropping their tokens lately, including recent high-profile airdrops from Jito and Pyth Network and upcoming drops from the likes of Jupiter, Starknet, Portal, Frame, and Blast.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."
