        "title": "Solana stablecoin volume just hit a record $144bn. Or did it? - DLNews",
        "content": "Market makers on a Solana-based exchange are responsible for the blockchain\u2019s soaring stablecoin metric.\n\nA Phoenix contributor says stablecoin transfer volume is \u201cnot a good indicator of economic activity.\u201d\n\nSolana co-founder also calls for clarity in stablecoin data.\n\nAt the start of December, something unexpected started happening on the Solana blockchain. The transfer volume of stablecoins started rising rapidly.\n\nIn less than eight weeks, the metric ballooned from around $33 billion to over $144 billion \u2014 a 336% increase.\n\nThe sudden rise in stablecoin transfers on Solana, unprecedented in the history of DeFi, was lauded by Solana\u2019s community. Blockchain analysts from Sphere used the metric in post comparing stablecoin trading volume to that of Visa transfers.\n\nBut according to Eugene Chen, co-founder of Ellipsis Labs, a core contributor to decentralised exchange Phoenix, the soaring stablecoin transfer metric doesn\u2019t indicate what many people think it does.\n\n\u201cThe metric may be correct, but it is not a good indicator of economic activity,\u201d Chen told DL News.\n\nChen confirmed that the majority of last week\u2019s $144 billion transfer volume came from the Solana-based Phoenix exchange.\n\nPhoenix requires users to deposit assets before placing orders on its markets. These deposits leave a record on the blockchain, and are susceptible to getting lumped in with data showing actual stablecoin trades.\n\nOn the surface, it may appear that the increase in stablecoin transfer volume comes from the creation and cancellation of trade orders \u2014 similar to high-frequency trading in traditional finance.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn this case, however, it is actually market makers depositing funds into specific markets on Phoenix, which is necessary before they can place trade orders on them.\n\nThe result is that as activity on Phoenix grew in recent weeks, so did Solana\u2019s stablecoin transfer volume.\n\nAnalysts who were unaware of how Phoenix worked assumed that Solana\u2019s stablecoin transfer volume equated to its stablecoin trading volume \u2014 real trades between two counterparties \u2014 when it did not.\n\nDefiLlama data shows that Phoenix settled $670 million worth of trades in the week ending January 28.\n\nOnchain stablecoin trading volumes is a widely-watched metric. Analysts view it as a powerful heuristic for quality activity because it represents real dollar equivalents moved around on a blockchain, rather than volatile, unbacked tokens.\n\nThe metric is most useful on blockchains with a substantial transaction fee \u2014 like Ethereum \u2014 because it implies those trades are likely to represent real economic activity.\n\n\u2018A common market-making pattern\u2019\n\nAccording to Chen, the reason Phoenix is responsible for an outsized amount of Solana transfer volume is because of the activity of market makers on the exchange.\n\nHe described \u201ca common market-making pattern\u201d where market makers repeatedly deposit and withdraw assets from different markets on Phoenix in order to place limit orders.\n\n\u201cNone of this is trading volume, but because it happens very frequently it creates a lot of token transfer volume,\u201d Chen said.\n\nSuch market-maker behaviour is not limited to onchain exchanges like Phoenix.\n\nIn markets including stocks, currencies, and commodities, market makers both buy and sell securities at competitive prices \u2014 acting as somewhat of a wholesaler. The market maker profits by exploiting price gaps with laser precision \u2014 hundreds of algorithmic trades that can happen in the blink of an eye. Investors benefit because such trading activity creates lots of counterparties, giving them a greater ability to quickly buy or sell a security, especially in large chunks.\n\nAnd as Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy told DL News in an interview last year, crypto market making activity is similar.\n\n\u201cThese are real USDC token transfers, creating real USDC transfer volume, but with little-to-no economic activity associated with them,\u201d Chen said.\n\nThe confusion arises when analysts, such as those at Sphere, compare Solana\u2019s stablecoin transfer volume \u2014 which includes thousands of onchain transfers from market makers \u2014 with that of other blockchains where such activity isn\u2019t recorded onchain.\n\nThis can give the false impression that Solana users are trading many more stablecoins than they actually are.\n\nFor Solana, making sure people don\u2019t overestimate the blockchain\u2019s activity metrics is important. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko wrote in an X post conversation about the issue:\n\n\u201cPls filter out the [market-maker] transfers.\u201d\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.
