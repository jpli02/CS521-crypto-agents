        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs Surge to Second Place in Sales, Beating Solana! Threatens Ethereum\u2019s Dominance - Blockmanity",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s presence in the NFT market has skyrocketed, claiming the second spot in terms of sales per blockchain, according to data platform CryptoSlam. Despite Bitcoin NFTs being a relatively recent addition, their sales have surged to a remarkable $167 million in the past thirty days, inching closer to Ethereum\u2019s leading position.\n\nBitcoin-based NFTs emerged only after the implementation of Inscriptions on the Bitcoin mainnet in January 2023. Since then, their meteoric rise has exceeded expectations, catapulting them to the forefront of the NFT landscape. In comparison to Ethereum\u2019s near-$397 million, Bitcoin NFT sales still fall short, but the gap is closing rapidly.\n\nCryptoSlam\u2019s data reveals that Bitcoin NFTs have outperformed those on the Solana network by nearly threefold, with sales reaching approximately $57 million. This remarkable growth can be attributed to the Ordinals Protocol, a mechanism allowing the inscription of satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin, with data such as a JPEG. Despite facing criticism within the Bitcoin community, the adoption of this protocol by NFT giant Yuga Labs in February has ignited enthusiasm and investment.\n\nThe leading Bitcoin-based NFT collection, Bitcoin Frogs, has amassed an impressive $6.3 million in sales over the past seven days. Boosted by a surge in popularity, the collection experienced a noteworthy spike, accumulating $2.3 million in sales on May 17 alone. This success further reinforces Bitcoin\u2019s rising prominence in the NFT market.\n\nAs Bitcoin NFTs continue to gain traction and challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominance, the future of the NFT landscape remains uncertain. With innovative protocols and growing investor interest, the battle for supremacy between these blockchain giants is intensifying, offering exciting prospects for the rapidly evolving NFT industry.\n\nDiscuss this news on our Telegram Community.

        "content": "Shaquille O\u2019Neal Faces Trial Over Ties to the \u2018Astrals\u2019 NFT Project\n\nBasketball star, media personality and all-round loveable giant, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, has received a class action complaint over his involvement in the Astrals NFT project. According to the official document, the charges against Mr O\u2019Neal include the \u2018offer and sale of unregistered securities, including tokens and NFTs.\u2019\n\nLaunched on the Solana Network back in the distant realm of March 2022, Astrals dropped 10k NFTs that would act as avatars in the Astralverse. However, as markets turned sour, the floor price cratered, dropping from an all-time high of 16 $SOL in April 2022 to the 1.22 $SOL for the currently lowest priced NFT in the collection.\n\nThrough the complaint, Daniel Harper alleges that Shaq promoted the sale of unregistered securities in the shape of NFTs and the platform\u2019s $GLXY utility token. Essentially, arguing that the assets represented \u2018securities\u2019 rather than colorful, Metaverse-ready jpegs.\n\nShaq got sued today in a class action lawsuit for his Astrals NFT. Why? Plaintiffs claim the Astrals tokens and NFTs (allegedly Shaq\u2019s \u201cbrainchild\u201d) were unregistered securities. It\u2019s truly never a dull day in crypto land. \u2014 Ariel Givner, Esq. (@GivnerAriel) May 24, 2023\n\nSleuths Uncover Plaintiff as an Active Member of the Solana Community\n\nAs a clued-in collection of tech-hardened individuals, the NFT community was quick to track down the wallet address of the plaintiff involved. As a result, seemingly unveiling them as an active NFT collector in the Solana space with assets including a \u2018Not Bored Ape,\u2019 \u2018Okay Gods,\u2019 \u2018DeY00ts,\u2019 and a .SOL domain name. If this is indeed the wallet of the fellow initiating the class action trial, then his continued involvement with \u2018unregistered securities\u2019 could prove a sticking point.\n\nThis is not the first time Shaq\u2019s blockchain dealings have led to him facing a jury. In tandem with the current trial, the former NBA superstar also faces charges for promoting the FTX empire before it famously and spectacularly imploded last year.\n\nWant more?

        "title": "Metaplex's Latest Updates Have Community Members Riled Up - Blockworks",
        "content": "Metaplex, a company that creates NFT tools for creators and developers on the Solana blockchain, introduced protocol update plans for its token metadata program yesterday, drawing community backlash.\n\nThis latest update will introduce immutability to token metadata but will ensure that its key characteristics are preserved. It will also introduce network fees of around 0.01 to 0.001 SOL to the token metadata program on select instructions.\n\nStephen Hess, the CEO of Metaplex, told Blockworks that \u201cthe goal of adding small transaction fees on Token Metadata is to align the protocol with the success of the community it serves and to fund on-going innovation including the completion of the Token Metadata program and continued development of new technology like Compressed NFTs, which we introduced late last year.\u201d\n\nUnlike on the Ethereum blockchain, where ERC (Ethereum request for comment) represents a blueprint of how contracts should function on the network, Solana does not yet have these interfaces, Mert Mumtaz, the co-founder and CEO of Helius, a Solana infrastructure company, told Blockworks.\n\nThis means that a single program owned by a single team will set the standard, Mumtaz said.\n\nAccording to a blog post from November 2022, Metaplex states that it accounts for over 99.9% of the Solana NFT market.\n\nConsidering Metaplex\u2019s importance in the Solana NFT market, Mumtaz notes that program freezing \u2014 the process of permanently locking metadata in decentralized storage so that the information will never go lost or missing \u2014 should be necessary.\n\nThis ensures that users will always have access to their NFTs and that a single for-profit entity does not have control over the entire network\u2019s NFTs, Mumtaz explains.\n\n\u201cI think the problem is it was assumed this was public infrastructure, like roads in a city, and now there\u2019s taxes or tolls being added to the roads in the city,\u201d Mumtaz said.\n\nThe tolls \u2014 or in this case the network fees \u2014 Mumtaz emphasizes, are not the biggest problem.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem is usually, if there\u2019s fees, we can just fork the program and people can choose to use a different program with no fees, but Metroplex changed their license such as their program is not open source anymore and you can\u2019t legally fork it past a certain point,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re essentially forced to pay a tax to use that program.\u201d\n\nMumtaz notes he does not believe the amount of tax that must be paid is the problem but the ethics behind the decision.\n\nIn response to these concerns, Hess highlights that it is important to note that it is still possible for anyone to fork Metaplex programs.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bIt\u2019s acceptable under the license for anyone to fork Metaplex programs even for a competitive use case, provided the fork isn\u2019t removing, replacing or modifying the fees,\u201d Hess said.\n\nThe code can also be forked and fees can be removed under the circumstances that a program or product is non-competitive, he notes.\n\n\u201cWe implemented the license in response to third parties forking our open source code, closing source and making the forks their proprietary businesses\u2026The license aims to strike a balance between protecting our ability to economically benefit from our code while also ensuring transparency, composability and freedom for developers to build on top of it,\u201d he said.\n\nHess confirms that there are no plans for Metaplex Foundation to change its license for now. He notes that important updates in response to the community\u2019s feedback will be published later today.\n\n\u201c[We] are committed to iterating to find the right balance between sustaining protocol innovation long term,\u201d he said.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
