        "content": "A Schenectady man will serve 18 years in prison to having sex with a child under 13 years of age.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, Judge Tatiana Coffinger sentenced Keith Solana, 28, to 18 years determinate with 20 years of post-release supervision. A full stay away order of protection was issued for the victim and the defendant is required to register as a sex offender just prior to his release from prison.\n\nMORE:\n\nSolana's plea fully satisfied a three-count indictment that charged 3 counts of Predatory Sexual Assault of a Child. The plea agreement called for a reduction of the second count of the indictment. The defendant admitted to engaging in sexual intercourse with the child who was 12 years old at the time of the offense. The defendant was known to the victim from the community. On the day of the incident, the victim had been walking with a family friend to a local business. On the way, they encountered the defendant who walked with them to their destination. Once at the business, the family friend went inside while the defendant stayed outside with the 12-year-old female victim. When the family friend came out of the business, the defendant asked if they wanted to go back to his apartment.\n\nThe victim wanted to go to his apartment, so the family friend allowed her to go with him. Once the defendant got the victim back to his apartment, he led her to the basement, where he engaged in oral sexual conduct and sexual intercourse with her on the basement floor. Cameras from the business placed the defendant with the victim at the local business and walking towards his apartment. Schenectady Youth Aid Bureau Detective Peter Verret investigated with the case. The victim was interviewed at the Schenectady Child Advocacy Center where the child disclosed the sexual assault.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto prices dropped sharply during the early trading session on Tuesday after the SEC sued Binance over illegal operations in the US during the overnight trade. The crypto industry\u2019s latest blow rocked digital asset prices on Monday.\n\n\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply on Tuesday as the largest crypto token tanked more than 4 per cent, falling below the $26,000 mark during the early day. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also weak as it dropped more than 3 per cent but remained above $1,800-levels. Majority of altcoins were in deep red, falling in tandem.\n\n\n\nCrypto markets have come under a selling pressure in the last 24 hours. The crypto fear and greed index has fallen by 9 points leading to its entry into the fear zone for the first time in nearly 3 months. This could be attributed to the latest accusations by the SEC against Binance of its failure to comply with US Securities law, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"The SEC\u2019s lawsuit has explicitly called out several popular coins like SOL, ADA, MATIC as securities causing their price to significantly fall as well. Meanwhile, the largest stablecoin provider Tether has decided to invest in renewable crypto mining operations in El Salvador where BTC is an official currency.,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll other top crypto tokens, even the stablecoins, were trading lower on Tuesday. BNB tumbled 8 per cent, while Solana and Dogecoin dropped 7 per cent each. Cardano, Polygon and Litecoin declined 6 per cent each, while Avalanche and XRP were down 5 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply lower, falling to $1.09 trillion-mark as it dropped about 4 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes zoomed about 90 per cent to $46.86 billion.\n\n\n\nNote: Price change in last 24 hours\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazriX Trade Desk\n\nTheta (THETA) is a video streaming network that utilizes blockchain technology. It was introduced in March 2019 and functions as a decentralized network, allowing users to share bandwidth and computing resources with each other on a peer-to-peer (P2P) model.\n\n\n\nOn the weekly time-frame, the THETA/USDT had been on a decline since August, last year. However, the trend is on the verge of a breakout from the descending trendline, with the THETA price gaining nearly 18% in the past week. An immediate support is expected at 0.7 USDT and next resistance is expected at 0.91 USDT\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is closely monitoring several cryptocurrencies including Solana, Polygon, and Cardano as part of its legal case against Binance.\n\nBinance, along with its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, is facing 13 charges. These charges include allegations of commingling customers\u2019 funds and attempting to circumvent U.S. securities laws through the use of \u2018sham controls\u2019 to determine business relationships with the company.\n\nOur response to the SEC's complaint.https://t.co/mgXxGTKr67 \u2014 Binance (@binance) June 5, 2023\n\nIn addition to the charges against Binance, the SEC has stated that cryptocurrencies like Solana, Polygon, Cardano, and others listed on the exchange are considered securities according to their lawsuit. These cryptocurrencies hold significant market value, with multi-billion dollar market caps, while some of them are associated with emerging gaming-focused projects.\n\nThe coins in question include:\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB token\n\nBinance exchange\u2019s stablecoin, BUSD,\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nFilecoin (FIL)\n\nCosmos Hub (ATOM)\n\nThe Sandbox (SAND)\n\nDecentraland (MANA)\n\nAlgorand (ALGO)\n\nAxie Infinity (AXS)\n\nCOTI (COTI)\n\nThe SEC\u2019s charges against Binance and BAM Trading (the operator of Binance.US) are primarily based on the allegation that both entities operated as exchanges without obtaining registration with the SEC. Furthermore, the charges include claims of them functioning as broker-dealers and clearing agencies without appropriate registration. Binance has maintained that Binance.US is a separate company from Binance. Today we charged Binance Holdings Ltd.

The SEC claims that these offerings and sales were conducted without complying with the necessary securities regulations.\n\n\u201cBinance and BAM Trading have unlawfully engaged in unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIn so doing, they have deprived investors of material information, including the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in these securities.\u201d\n\nA security refers to a tradeable financial instrument that holds some form of monetary value and represents an ownership interest or a debt obligation of an individual, organization, or government entity.\n\nSecurities can take various forms, such as stocks, bonds, options, or derivatives. They are typically regulated and governed by specific laws and regulatory bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States, to protect investors and ensure fair and transparent markets.\n\nSEC Chairman, Gary Gensler, previously said that all crypto tokens, besides bitcoin, are securities.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for latest posts and updates _____________________________________ _____________________________________"

        "title": "Solana (SOL) Hits $21, HedgeUp (HDUP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Predicted to Hit $1 Dollar This Year - The Portugal News",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been keeping a keen eye on the market, particularly focusing on Solana (SOL), HedgeUp (HDUP), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). These digital coins have seen remarkable progress in the past few months, with Solana hitting the $21 mark and both HedgeUp (HDUP) , and Shiba Inu (SHIB) predicted to reach $1 within the year.\n\nBy Advertiser, in Crypto \u00b7 06 Jun 2023, 13:31 \u00b7 0 Comments\n\nSolana (SOL): Scaling New Heights\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana (SOL) has been making waves in the crypto world, successfully marking a significant price milestone by reaching $21. Solana's (SOL) high-speed, high-capacity blockchain has been the main driving force behind its success, making it one of the most efficient platforms in the cryptocurrency space.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Solana (SOL) token, which powers the Solana (SOL) ecosystem, has experienced increased demand due to its utility and the network's scalability. As blockchain adoption grows and scalability becomes an essential factor for businesses and developers, Solana's (SOL) innovative architecture has put it in a prime position to capitalize on this trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nHedgeUp (HDUP): The One to Watch\n\n\n\n\n\nHedgeUp's (HDUP) fresh approach to the market, blending non-fungible tokens (NFTs), alternative asset investments, and AI-powered trading, has garnered considerable attention in the crypto space. Despite being a newcomer, its successful presale has positioned HedgeUp (HDUP) for a bright future.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anticipation surrounding HedgeUp's (HDUP) potential has led to predictions of the HedgeUp (HDUP) token reaching the $1 milestone within the year. The integration of multiple asset classes and AI technology offers a unique proposition, contributing to HedgeUp's (HDUP) rapid rise.\n\n\n\n\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Coin Turning Heads\n\n\n\n\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB), inspired by Dogecoin (DOGE), has not only captured the attention of the crypto community but has also been making significant strides. Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained popularity due to its meme coin status but has since evolved to develop its ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe success of ShibaSwap, the project's decentralized exchange, and the team's continuous efforts to build the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem have increased Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) utility. This growth has led to speculation that Shiba Inu (SHIB) will join the $1 club before the year ends.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we delve deeper into 2023, the cryptocurrency landscape continues to fluctuate. Solana's (SOL) steady rise underpins the demand for high-speed, scalable blockchains. At the same time, HedgeUp's (HDUP) unique approach provides a fresh perspective, drawing in investors keen to explore innovative crypto assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nShiba Inu's (SHIB) journey from meme coin to a legitimate contender demonstrates the unpredictable nature of the crypto market. The cryptocurrency's potential to hit the $1 milestone illustrates the possibilities that arise when community backing combines with a dedicated development team.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, these predictions should not overshadow the inherent risks and volatility associated with the crypto market. While Solana (SOL), HedgeUp (HDUP), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) offer promising prospects, it is vital to conduct thorough research and consider all potential risks before making any investment decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the year will undoubtedly provide more twists and turns in the crypto market. Solana's robust platform, HedgeUp's (HDUP) innovative approach, and Shiba Inu's (SHIB) growing ecosystem make them compelling assets to watch. Whether they reach their predicted milestones remains to be seen, but they certainly make for an exciting year ahead in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about HedgeUp (HDUP) presale use the links down below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
