        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that Solana (SOL) will come close to its all-time highs once Ethereum (ETH) kicks off its bull market.\n\nIn a new strategy session, the host of InvestAnswers tells his 446,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana could go up to $250, an increase of more than 870% from its current price of $25.75.\n\nAccording to the pseudonymous analyst, Solana\u2019s rise will likely be triggered by Ethereum\u2019s Cancun upgrade, which is expected to further elevate the leading smart contract platform\u2019s scalability. The InvestAnswers host mentions a prediction made by Blofin, a crypto-financial services firm that sees Ethereum rising to $9,700 following the update.\n\n\u201cPer Blofin, they predict that after the Cancun upgrade of Ethereum, price could exceed $9,700 per ETH in the first quarter of 2024. And of course, that is their most optimistic case\u2026\n\nThe next question is always, \u2018Well if Ethereum goes to $9,700, what\u2019s the price of Solana?\u2019 I calculated it for you. It\u2019s going to be at least $250 if ETH hits $9,700.\n\nRemember $9,700 from where it is now is over a 5x and of course, Solana goes up faster than ETH will at that time.\u201d\n\nWhile the InvestAnswers host believes that Ethereum could rally to $9,700, he doesn\u2019t see the surge happening in the coming months.\n\n\u201cGreat to see $9,700 ETH. Maybe we\u2019ll see in the bull run. I doubt we\u2019ll see it in the first quarter of 2024, but perhaps early 2025.\u201d\n\nLooking at Bitcoin (BTC), the anonymous analyst reiterates his prediction that the flagship crypto asset will soar by over 40% from current levels by early next year.\n\n\u201cI did say many times a few months ago, I would not be surprised if we had a $42,000 Bitcoin target by somewhere between January and April of 2024.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $29,804 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
