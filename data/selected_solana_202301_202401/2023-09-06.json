        "title": "Lido on Solana Seeks $1.5 Million Financial Aid to Continue Operations - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The team behind the Lido on Solana project is struggling to meet its initial objectives and is looking to the community to fund the project with $1.5 million for growth and development.\n\nHowever, its staking solution on the Solana network could cease if the project does not get financial assistance.\n\nA $1.5 Million Budget to Keep Lido on Solana Functional\n\nA proposal by Yuri Mediakov of P2P \u2014 the company managing Lido on Solana \u2014 suggested two different scenarios to the Lido DAO community, with votes either determining the continued operation of Lido on Solana or the sunsetting of the project.\n\nOne of the suggested scenarios requires the Lido DAO community to inject $1.5 million for the next 12 months into Lido on Finance to sustain and grow the project. The budget includes $200,000 dispensed quarterly for development expenses, $600,000 set aside as a marketing budget annually, and $100,000 annually channeled toward customer support.\n\nWithin the 12 months, Mediakov said the P2P team will be able to achieve over 1% of Solana\u2019s staking market share. With this, the team could generate an income of 10,191 SOL annually worth $200,000 at current prices.\n\nThe proposal believed that Lido could play a significant role in the growth of the Solana ecosystem, provided the P2P team has the financial backing of the Lido DAO.\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe in the potential of the Solana ecosystem and are confident that Lido on Solana can play a pivotal role in its growth. The Solana network has shown remarkable promise in scalability, speed, and innovation, making it a fertile ground for DeFi projects and beyond. We are committed to leveraging these advantages to make Lido on Solana a cornerstone in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nLido\u2019s Liquid Staking Solution Failing on Other Blockchains\n\nThe second option, meanwhile, proposes winding down the project in the absence of financial aid. According to Mediakov, the \u2018sunsetting process\u2019 will start in September 2023 and end in February 2024. If the community opts for this scenario, the proposal seeks support of $20,000 monthly from the Lido DAO to cover technical maintenance for five months starting from Sept. 4, 2023.\n\nThe option of Lido on Solana winding down would follow a similar move that saw the winding down of Lido on Kusama and Polkadot. While Lido Finance may be struggling with liquid staking on other networks, the entity has the highest amount of staked Ethereum (ETH), controlling 32.4% of the staking market share, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nP2P acquired the Lido on Solana project from Chorus One in March 2022, and since then, has made some product and business developments, which included growing its total value locked (TVL) by 330% from 954,000 SOL in December 2021 to 4.1 million SOL in October 2022.\n\nHowever, Mediakov stated that an investment of around $700,000 generated a revenue of only $220,000, causing a huge loss of nearly $500,000. Since P2P\u2019s ownership, SOL, Solana\u2019s native token, has dropped more than 92% from its all-time high of nearly $260 in November 2021.\n\nAs stated in the proposal, voting will commence in four weeks, with Mediakov stating:\n\n\u201cWe are at a critical juncture where the decisions we make today will shape the future of Lido on Solana. We are optimistic about what we can achieve together and look forward to your constructive feedback. We aim to bring this proposal to a Snapshot vote as soon as possible, solidifying our shared commitment to the success and longevity of Lido on Solana.\u201d"

        "title": "Visa and Solana (SOL) News Shake Up the Crypto Industry: Is it Real? - YouHodler.com",
        "content": "Every day, massive headlines hit the cryptocurrency industry that many think will change the course of this technology forever. The latest example of this is news surrounding the Solana (SOL) blockchain.\n\nSolana\u2019s price is up significantly after Visa announced a new plan to use the SOL blockchain for USDC payments. As expected, there has been a lot of hype around SOL price recently, which is why we chose it as YouHodler\u2019s \u201ccoin of the week.\u201d We\u2019ll dig into the details later but first, a little introduction.\n\nWhat is Solana (SOL)?\n\nSolana first came to being as a competitor to Ethereum. Software developer Anatoly Yakovenko believed he could make an innovative blockchain that worked similarly to Ethereum but with an improved consensus mechanism called \u201cproof-of-history.\u201d\n\nUnlike proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, proof-of-history uses timestamps to locate and define the next block in Solana\u2019s chain. With this difference, Solana can address two major issues of the Ethereum blockchain: scalability and security.\n\nWhile Solana has not lived up to its \u201cEthereum killer\u201d reputation just yet, its open-source platform is quickly attracting new decentralized apps (dApps) and transaction times are much faster and more affordable than competitors like Ethereum and Cardano.\n\nSolana (SOL) price history\n\nLike the rest of the crypto market, Solana\u2019s most recent massive peak came in 2021 during the last bull market. At that time, SOL reached an all-time high of nearly $260. Since then, SOL prices have seen sharp declines. In 2023, SOL\u2019s price started to stabilize around the low to mid $20 range.\n\nIn July of 2023, SOL price broke out of a descending resistance line that was active for 609 days - potentially signaling a trend reversal. However, this reversal was short-lived and not nearly as extreme as some analysts thought. Currently, $27 is the line of significant resistance for SOL.\n\nWith the latest visa news, all eyes are on SOL\u2019s price chart to see if this is the push it needs to achieve a bullish divergence.\n\nSOL/USDT Chart by TradingView\n\n\u200d\n\nSolana (SOL) and Visa announce new collaborative plan\n\nSOL saw a 7% price increase following recent news from Visa stating the digital payment company has plans to use the Solana blockchain for its payment services. More specifically, it will do so to help scale its USDC stablecoin settlements.\n\nThis announcement comes just two weeks after Shopify integrated Solana into its platform for cryptocurrency payments - putting more eyes on traditional finance to the promising Solana blockchain.\n\nAside from price, the Solana-Visa news also saw a sharp rise in Total Value Locked (TVL) on the blockchain. More than $2 million was added in a matter of hours.\n\nA rise in TVL means that user deposits are increasing - suggesting that there is more interest in the Solana blockchain. More interest, of course, means more users and more users means more buying pressure which could positively impact the price of SOL.\n\nSolana (SOL) price prediction\n\nAs stated before, analysts are keeping a close high on prices above $22. If SOL prices can move with conviction past $25 and $27, then that is bullish. On the other hand, a rejection from that resistance means SOL could go back below $20 to its low support level of around $18. If this happens, any bullish outlook will expire.\n\nRegardless of what happens, trading SOL with MultiHODL opens up numerous opportunities in bullish and bearish directions. Multiply your SOL up to x70 and conduct technical analysis with integrated TradingView charts in Multi HODL.\n\nDisclaimer: The content should not be construed as investment advice and does not constitute an offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

        "content": "Solana led gainers in the top 10 cryptos, after the protocol announced a new partnership with payments giant Visa. Bitcoin and Ether were little changed, even as Bitcoin whales have been steadily accumulating the asset since Aug. 25, market experts told Forkast.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Grayscale\u2019s favorable court verdict, ETF hype fail to lift Bitcoin above US$28,000\n\nSolana leads winners, Bitcoin whales continue buying\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token was the day\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 10 cryptocurrencies, rising 2.38% in the past 24 hours to US$19.81. SOL started gaining yesterday after the protocol announced a partnership with Visa. The payments giant will be using the Solana blockchain as a settlement layer in its pilot program for enterprise-grade throughput at \u201cvirtually no cost\u201d for Visa issuers and merchants.\n\nAdding to the blockchain\u2019s utility, Visa also announced that two additional merchants, Worldpay Global and Nuvei, will be piloting USDC settlement payments on Solana.\n\nIn the wider crypto market, Bitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$25,735 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s sluggish price action, large holders, also known as \u2018whales\u2019, have been steadily accumulating Bitcoin since Aug. 25, according to Mike Ermolaev, founder of blockchain PR firm Outset PR and the author of the interview series \u2018Crypto Opinion with Mike Ermolaev.\u2019\n\n\u201cInstitutional investors who have deep pockets and the ability to hold Bitcoin long-term are key to supporting Bitcoin\u2019s growth. Positive regulatory developments coupled with the upcoming halving event of Bitcoin in 2024 have the potential to lead to a strong price increase for Bitcoin,\u201d wrote Ermolaev, referencing the below chart.\n\nAs for the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether slipped 0.12% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,629 and declined 5.06% during the past week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.15% to US$1.04 trillion while market volume increased 0.04% to US$24.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nMutant Ape Yacht Club sales rise over 200%\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.26% to 2,176.81 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 0.78% during the week.\n\nFollowing yesterday\u2019s 400% sales surge for the Bored Ape Yacht Club, 24-hour sales for it\u2019s twin collection, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, rose 213% to US$762,915, making it the third-largest NFT collection across all blockchains by 24-hour sales volume.\n\nBoosted by the collection, Ethereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token (NFT) sales rose 32.74% to US$6.62 million. Sales for Milady Maker strengthened 596% to US$287,012.\n\nMythos Chain remained the second largest blockchain by 24-hour sales volume, despite sales falling 6% in the past 24 hours to US$1.15 million. Sales for the DMarket collection fell 6.38% to US$1.13 million, remaining the second-largest NFT collection by daily sales volume.\n\nIn the wider NFT space, tokenized real estate platform Roofstock OnChain successfully completed its third property sales through its NFT marketplace, with a property in South Carolina sold for US$204,000 worth of USDC, marking another milestone for tokenized assets.\n\nAsian equities rise despite yuan falling to 10-month low, U.S. equities fall after Cleveland Fed chief hints at more rate hikes\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMost major Asian equities \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shanghai Composite and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 \u2013 rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, except the Shenzhen Component.\n\nChina\u2019s yuan fell to a 10-month low against the U.S. dollar, before the People\u2019s Bank of China stepped in, offering support for the yuan to prevent a further price fall. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that major state-owned banks were actively selling U.S. dollars onshore in early trading, while mopping up yuan liquidity, to slow the yuan\u2019s decline.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures \u2013 Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures \u2013 fell on Wednesday.\n\nThe declines followed hawkish comments from Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester, who said that the central bank may need to raise rates \u201ca bit higher,\u201d but did not mention what officials should do at the next interest rate meeting that is scheduled for Sept. 19-20.\n\nOver in Europe, the benchmark STOXX 600 fell 0.63% while Frankfurt\u2019s DAX 40 fell 0.34%, following hawkish remarks from European Central Bank official Klaas Knot, who cautioned that traders betting against an interest rate increase next week might be underestimating its likelihood. Klaas also emphasized that achieving the central bank\u2019s 2% inflation target by the end of 2025 should be the minimum commitment for policymakers.\n\nAdding to investor concerns, German industrial orders fell 11.7% in July, surpassing the expected 4.3% decline, according to the federal statistics office. This marks the steepest drop since the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak in April 2020.\n\nSee related article: Grayscale wins against SEC as India moves on blockchain; Friend.tech loses friends"

        "content": "More than 70% of Solana\u2019s SOL tokens are staked. Of those, less than 3% are in liquid staking protocols.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity to unlock the other 97% of stake on the network,\u201d one founder told DL News.\n\nThe ease of staking on Solana, as well as the fear that liquid staking comes with non-zero risk, are roadblocks to greater liquid staking adoption.\n\nLiquid staking is Ethereum\u2019s largest sub-industry, accounting for its biggest protocol and a rapidly growing share of the collateral used in the blockchain\u2019s other DeFi protocols.\n\nOn Solana, developers and investors wish that were the case.\n\nEthereum, Solana, and other blockchains that rely on proof-of-stake technology are secured by users who lock up \u2014 or stake \u2014 their tokens in exchange for a modest annual yield.\n\nThose tokens are required for the complex but critical job of ordering and verifying transactions on blockchains that use proof-of-stake technology.\n\nAlthough staked tokens are effectively locked away, liquid staking protocols issue redeemable, derivative tokens on a 1:1 basis, allowing users to take advantage of a blockchain\u2019s staking yield \u2014 5% for Ethereum, 7% for Solana \u2014 while putting them to use in other DeFi protocols for additional profit.\n\nOnce cheekily called liquid staking derivatives, or LSDs, the industry has since distanced itself from the term, potentially fearful of inviting regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMore than 70% of Solana\u2019s SOL tokens have been entrusted to individuals, businesses, and protocols that use them to order and verify transactions.\n\nOf those, however, less than 3% are entrusted to businesses that issue trade-able, derivative tokens known as liquid staking tokens.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nShould that change, it could dramatically change DeFi on Solana.\n\nNOW READ: Solana enjoys post-FTX \u2018renaissance\u2019 on back of network and DeFi upgrades\n\nOnly 3% of the more than $9 billion in staked SOL is in LSTs, Ben Chow, founder of Solana protocols Meteora and Jupiter, told DL News.\n\n\u201cA lot of work has been done to grow LST adoption and unlock this capital which will dramatically improve TVL and volumes.\u201d\n\nLucas Bruder, CEO of Jito Labs, the company behind liquid staking protocol Jito, agreed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity to unlock the other 97% of stake on the network for liquid staking,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cI don\u2019t think any LST protocol has been able to figure out the correct marketing and narrative for that yet, we\u2019re excited to take a swing at it and figure it out.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s easier said than done.\n\nLow stakes\n\nEthereum switched to proof-of-stake technology almost one year ago, and only one in five Ether tokens, or roughly 26 million, have been staked, according to data compiled by pseudonymous data analyst Hildobby, of venture capital firm Dragonfly.\n\nNOW READ: Ether liquid staking soars past $20bn as upgrade sparks rush for yield\n\nIt\u2019s a pittance compared to other blockchains that have used proof-of-stake technology from their inception, such as Solana.\n\nBut the difference is in the liquidity.\n\nOn Ethereum, one in three staked tokens have been entrusted just to liquid staking protocol Lido. Altogether, almost 40% of staked Ether has been deposited in Ethereum\u2019s many liquid staking protocols, according data from Elias Simos of research firm Rated.\n\nMeanwhile, less than 3% of staked SOL has been deposited to Solana\u2019s liquid staking protocols, according to Solana Compass.\n\nAmong Solana\u2019s \u201ctop stakers,\u201d the 1,651 people who have staked at least 5,000 SOL, only 152 hold liquid staking tokens, according to data platform Spire.\n\nIn May, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko took to Twitter, now known as X, to vent his frustration.\n\n\u201cThe percentage of SOL in liquid staking and DeFi is abysmally small,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe need a community-wide effort to change it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Additional risk\u2019\n\nA survey of SOL stakers showed two reasons for the relatively low uptake, according to Alex Cerba, a core contributor at liquid staking protocol Marinade.\n\nMarinade is Solana\u2019s largest protocol and issues the mSOL liquid staking token.\n\nLiquid staking protocol Marinade is Solana's largest as measured by the total value of its crypto deposits.\n\nThe first issue was the potential tax implications of staking, Cerba told DL News. When a user deposits SOL and receives a liquid staking token, is that a taxable event? When exactly do they pay tax on the yield from their staked token?\n\nSecond, Solana was built to make staking easy and effectively risk-free. Stakers don\u2019t always believe the additional yield available in Solana DeFi is worth the effort and risk that comes with entrusting millions of dollars to a protocol built by a third-party, audits be damned.\n\n\u201cSince I don\u2019t get a lot of yield in DeFi, I\u2019m taking additional risk with mSOL,\u201d Cerba said, channelling survey respondents, \u201cjust to get 9% APY when I could get 7% just staking, with no smart contract risk.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: Demand surge for $16b Ether staking raises \u2018mass slashing\u2019 and code bug risks\n\nKel Eleje, a research analyst at Messari, agrees.\n\nThe validators who stake on users\u2019 behalf often do so for free, he said. Moreover, users can withdraw their stake in two days, compared to the two-week period for those who stake ether.\n\n\u201cIt essentially feels like liquid staking at slightly lower risk,\u201d Eleje said.\n\nTo that end, Marinade recently released its own version of Solana\u2019s built-in staking offering, Marinade Native. The hope is that people who have already staked their SOL use that and eventually transition to liquid staking with Marinade.\n\nOver the summer, newer liquid staking protocols Jito and BlazeStake have soared, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nLiquid staking protocol Jito have grown rapidly over the summer.\n\nEleje attributed the growth to airdrop speculation as well as their liquid staking tokens\u2019 popularity on MarginFi, a lending protocol that has also grown in popularity.\n\nBut Bruder said users are likely drawn by innovation.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at jitoSOL usage in DeFi, the usage ratio is way higher than other LSTs,\u201d he said.\n\nWhere Ethereum \u2018is a bit ahead\u2019\n\nLiquid staking protocol BlazeStake have grown rapidly over the summer.\n\nIf another 4% of staked SOL were staked through protocols like Marinade or Jito, it would double the total value of crypto in Solana DeFi.\n\nBut Cerda isn\u2019t sure Solana is ready for that.\n\n\u201cSome people are looking at it a bit naively, because they just look at the opportunity of having this much capital flowing into DeFi,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the places where you can deposit a very large amount of funds in DeFi on Solana right now are quite scarce.\u201d\n\nDeFi on Solana would need to grow in order to handle a massive influx of liquid staking tokens, creating a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\n\u201cYou would also need the DeFi protocols to go and to have more use cases, more volume, to basically take in all that capital,\u201d Cerda said. \u201cThat\u2019s where Ethereum is a bit ahead.\u201d\n\nAleks Gilbert is a DeFi Correspondent for DL News.
