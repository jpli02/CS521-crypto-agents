        "title": "Yakovenko Envisions Solana ($SOL) Handling All of the World's Blockchain Needs - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "In a recent interview, Solana Labs Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko revealed that the Solana (SOL) blockchain is prepared to accommodate hundreds of millions of users.\n\nDuring an interview with YouTube series Token Terminal, Yakovenko stated that the Ethereum (ETH) competitor has the potential to meet global blockchain needs, considering the affordability of the current bandwidth infrastructure.\n\nYakovenko explained that today\u2019s data centers offer one gigabit as the free tier, and egress costs less than a dollar per terabyte, making bandwidth remarkably inexpensive. Despite Solana\u2019s capacity to handle numerous users, he acknowledged that the platform still lacks the applications necessary to attract a larger audience.\n\nYakovenko mentioned that with new generations emerging every two years, Solana has the capacity to support hundreds of millions of users. However, it needs more applications to draw them in. He identified potential growth drivers such as Helium (HNT), a network of IoT devices that successfully migrated to the Solana blockchain earlier this year, and Hivemapper, a decentralized map building tool.\n\nDiscussing Helium, Yakovenko highlighted that the project has created nearly a million IoT hotspots and has the potential for virtual tokens to impact the physical world through cryptography. He also mentioned that Helium plans to achieve similar success with 5G by creating a network of antennas for that technology.\n\nRegarding Hivemapper, Yakovenko stated that the project aims to map the world like Google Street View, covering 60 million kilometers globally. He shared that Hivemapper has already surpassed 2 million kilometers and continues to grow.\n\nAs of 7:40 p.m. UTC on May 7, 2023, TradingView data shows that $SOL is trading at approximately $22.48, experiencing a 1.91% increase within the past 24 hours and a 127.41% rise year-to-date."
