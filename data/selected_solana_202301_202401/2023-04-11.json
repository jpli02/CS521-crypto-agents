Discover SCENE\n\nSolana (SOL) has enjoyed a hefty price surge, outperforming the rest of what is already a bullish market.\n\nSOL has increased by over 10.1% in the past day, reaching a monthly peak of $22.50, per CoinGecko data. The swift rise up also liquidated nearly $2.7 million in trades, with more than 92% of that figure made up of blown short positions, according to Coinglass.\n\nSolana is a speedy, proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network launched in March 2020 by Solana Labs. Like many other popular layer-1 networks, developers can build out various decentralized finance (DeFi) apps and non-fungible token (NFT) projects on the network.\n\nAnother factor prompting excitement around Solana is the release of Saga, an Android smartphone powered by the Solana blockchain, on April 13. The phone is expected to let users mint their own NFTs from anywhere and access the wider Solana-based ecosystem of apps and projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolana's team unveiled the Saga smartphone last year in June 2022. It's expected to cost users $1,000.\n\nEveryone has a story.

        "content": "Bitcoin continued to rally past US$30,000, with Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies gaining in Tuesday afternoon trade in Asia. Solana was the biggest gainer with 11.09%. Asian equity markets mostly rose after traders returned from the Easter holiday and remained positive on soft inflation data from China.\n\nSee related article: Ethereum blockchain upgrade unlocks US$34 billion in Ether, what does it mean for crypto prices?\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin strengthened 6.46% to US$30,128 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, and rose 7.51% in the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. The value of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is at its highest since June 2022, as investors perceive it as a safe haven amid recession and inflation.\n\nEthereum rose 3.36% on the day to US$1,923, and increased 6.13% on the week. The gains come ahead of the blockchain\u2019s Shanghai upgrade scheduled for April 12 at 22:27 UTC (April 13, 6:27 a.m. in Hong Kong). The upgrade is expected to enable the withdrawal of around 18 million staked Ether (US$34.5 billion) \u2014 or about 15% of the total supply.\n\nA survey of 700 ETH traders, investors and developers by crypto exchange OKX showed that 83% of those surveyed expect more ETH to be staked in the next three months, while 63% of respondents predict that ETH will hit a new record high of over US$5,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nSolana gained the most among top 10 cryptos, rising 11.09% in 24 hours to US$22.49, bringing its weekly gains to 9.54%.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization rose 4.75% to US$1.24 trillion, while the total crypto market volume increased 66.11% to US$48.47 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.31% to 3,945.34 points on the day but slipped 1.93% during the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day.\n\nAsian equity markets mostly gained on Tuesday, after China\u2019s annual inflation unexpectedly came in at 0.7% in March, the slowest pace since September 2021, due to gradual economic recovery after removal of zero-Covid policy.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite lost 0.05% while the Shenzhen Component Index rose 0.04%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index gained 0.76% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened 1.05%.\n\nEuropean bourses gained on Tuesday, as markets resumed after the Easter break. The STOXX 600 rose 0.66% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 inched up 0.86% to 15,732 points to its highest since January 2022.\n\nInvestors are anticipating the release of March U.S. inflation report on Wednesday and the start of the corporate earnings season from Friday. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs warned that this could be the worst earnings season in years, as companies grapple with high inflation and rising borrowing costs.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index fell 0.47% to 102.08 points following Friday\u2019s payroll data. The euro rose 0.55% to US$1.09, trading close to its two-month high.\n\nGold rose 0.73% to US$2,004 per ounce on Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar eased ahead of March inflation data.\n\nSee related article: Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade is imminent \u2013 and investors are excited\n\n(Updates to bullets one, two and seven.)"
