        "content": "It is expected to be announced at the upcoming BRICS summit that the alliance will be creating a new trade currency backed by gold. The news sent the entire precious metals complex surging to fresh multi-month highs.\n\nOne question that experts have heard since the news of a new gold-backed currency is regarding investors in Gold.\n\nThere is a way to set up an individual retirement account to hold gold as a qualified retirement investment. This is a Gold IRA, and many investors opt for this type of account to hold physical metals such as bullion or coins, as well as precious metals-related securities within their portfolio.\n\nAlso Read: BRICS Nations Buy Massive Amounts of Gold to Back New Currency\n\nWith curiosity surrounding the new currency, investors are left wondering if the BRICS Summit presents a golden opportunity to consider diversifying their retirement accounts into Gold IRAs.\n\nSource: Dailyfx.com\n\nShould You Invest In Gold IRA Before The 2023 BRICS Summit?\n\nSome experts suggest that with the gold-backed BRICS currency looking imminent, it may be wise to look into a Gold IRA.\n\nFor example, experts assume that gold, being a tangible and historically trusted asset, can serve as a valuable hedge against potential currency fluctuations and devaluation. With the growing de-dollarization globally, Gold may be a prominent, safe asset.\n\nAlso Read: BRICS Confident in New Expansion Criteria Ahead of 2023 Summit\n\nA Gold IRA allows future retirees to diversify their retirement portfolios beyond traditional assets like stocks and bonds. With the BRICS gold currency potentially coming soon, the demand for gold may begin to gain momentum. Hence, its value will only grow.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that starting a Gold IRA involves complying with IRS regulations and understanding rules and procedures. Seeking advice from financial professionals and conducting thorough research is crucial in making informed decisions when starting a Gold IRA. Be sure to do this before deciding to start an account. Additionally, do this research before Gold potentially soars after a BRICS currency announcement is made at the upcoming summit."

        "title": "Intra-annual density fluctuations in tree rings are proxies of air temperature across Europe | Scientific Reports - Nature.com",
        "content": "This study is the first to analyze IADFs frequency across a broad network of sites representing a large range of climatic conditions and diverse woody species in Europe. A previous study29 analyzed IADFs frequency in three Pinus species across Italy and the Iberian Peninsula. The present network includes 89 sites and 11 different species, and it is climatologically representative (in terms of mean annual precipitation and temperature) of 4 cluster groups spanning from semi-arid to temperate. The network over-represents the Mediterranean area, where the occurrence of IADFs has been studied much more intensively, and under-represents the northernmost areas of Europe, where IADF studies are less common17. We took this over- and under-representation into account by applying weight-adjusted analyses in the GAM model and the interpretation of the results. Further, the limited number of angiosperm samples has been considered in the model with species-specific coefficients regarding temperature, precipitation and SPEI, thus our findings are not dependent on the limited number of samples for angiosperm species. Our findings confirm those of previous studies: for all studied species, the predisposition to form IADFs depends on tree age29,30 and tree-ring width17,21,31. In particular, all analyzed species show relatively high IADFs frequencies (> 50%, Fig. 2) in wider rings, which has also been reported in studies on pine species11,29,32,33,34,35. Wide rings are often associated with favorable conditions for tree growth and a longer growing season20,24,29,36. In wider rings, more cells are under differentiation for a longer period, which makes the presence of IADFs more likely as long as the triggering factors occur31,37.\n\nThe uneven spatial distribution of the species in our IADFs network must be taken into account when looking at spatial patterns in IADFs frequency. Nevertheless, the results clearly indicate that some species, such as P. abies, L. decidua, and P. halepensis, are more prone to IADFs formation than others. High IADFs frequencies have already been reported in gymnosperms growing in temperate climates (e.g., L. decidua and P. abies in Poland38,39), where IADFs occurrence is linked to weather fluctuations occurring during the second part of the growing season40,41. IADFs in these species may contribute to safer water transport during climate fluctuations42, allowing those species to be more plastic and responsive to climate39. On the other hand, P. halepensis is the most widely distributed Mediterranean pine species and is well-adapted to growing under xeric conditions43. Several studies have found that P. halepensis experiences a summer reduction in tree growth followed by a reactivation of cambial activity during rainy autumns, which often leads to the formation of IADFs16,27,29,35,44,45,46. Although the occurrence of IADFs is not related to one single environmental factor, since their formation can be influenced by altitude, aspect, tree species, tree state, tree age, and total ring width20,21,29,34,38,47, our network analysis indicates that the formation of IADFs in the majority of species depends primarily on warm growing season temperatures (Fig. 5, Table 1). High temperatures such as those recorded in the last decades can induce stomata closure at all canopy levels, especially when coupled with intense drought events48. Such events might also force trees to adapt their phenology and start growing earlier in spring49,50. In those conditions, trees can anticipate growth onset to take advantage of favorable conditions (i.e., day length, temperature) and maximize growth rates before the start of summer drought51. However, anticipating the onset of the growing season has an associated risk: high temperatures during spring and summer drought events6. Thus, the longer growing seasons observed at several Mediterranean sites are associated with two main growth peaks interrupted by the drought-induced cessation of summer growth44. This bimodal growth pattern is also associated with the formation of IADFs and has been reported in several conifer species (P. halepensis16,44,45,52,53; P. pinaster33,40,54; J. thurifera46,55; P. pinea11) and in several hardwood species (Q. ilex56; A. unedo25,57). In A. unedo, an evergreen broadleaf, and P. abies, an evergreen conifer, total annual precipitation seems to play an important role in IADF formation. Indeed, we found a higher frequency of IADFs when precipitation is low. Evergreen broadleaved trees grow primarily in the very dry and warm areas of the Mediterranean and suffer from water shortage during summer6,25. A. unedo in particular strongly reduces its hydraulic conductivity and photosynthetic activity during dry years, and invests stored carbohydrates in structures that guarantee tree survival6. Thus, IADFs may be produced to guarantee sufficient mechanical strength against cavitation, and hydraulic safety by modifying tracheid dimensions and pit morphology. On the other hand, P. abies is highly dependent on total precipitation58; the formation of IADFs in the earlywood of this species is determined by drought conditions39. The role of precipitation in IADFs formation is also relevant for Q. ilex, P. pinea, and P. pinaster. Rainfall during the growing season and soon after a cambial stop triggered by drought could favor the resumption of cambial activity leading to the formation of IADFs in latewood11,29,32. For instance, in Mediterranean coastal areas, Q. ilex can resume growth in response to autumn precipitation, resulting in an \u201cextra\u201d growth band in the annual ring23. All of those species are drought tolerant and able to benefit from sporadic rain events during drought59. The significant positive correlations between IADFs formation of the three aforementioned species and the multiscale drought index underpins the importance of precipitation for IADF formation60. In addition, increased water availability can support higher cell production rates and thereby induce the formation of wider tree rings and potentially containing IADFs.\n\nOur study presents broad-scale patterns of relationships between IADFs and climate data across sites and different tree species over a wide climatic gradient in Europe. At this scale, clustered distribution patterns seem to be larger and more important than local climate variations. The two functional groups (gymnosperms and angiosperms) show similar overall responses in terms of reaction to climate-related triggering factors, although these are based on different seasonal and physiological mechanisms. In particular, IADFs are more frequent at the southern coastal Mediterranean sites, where growing seasons are generally longer. Indeed, high temperature is the common factor influencing the majority of sites and species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that IADFs can be used as proxies for past air temperatures with intra-annual resolution. Species with bimodal growth patterns are able to reactivate cambial activity and tolerate drought during their growth. It should be noted that our samples are collected predominantly in the Mediterranean area. It is therefore possible that some of the relationships presented here will differ in strength and direction if more samples from temperate and continental climates areas are included. Expanding this study with more data (especially from other regions) will help to understand possible differences between species and sites. It could also help to better identify species that will respond positively to climate change and the impact that increasing temperatures will have on forest ecosystems."
