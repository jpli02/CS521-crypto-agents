Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThis month, more new fungible tokens have been minted on Solana than at any point in the network\u2019s history\u2014by a staggering degree.\n\nIn the last two weeks alone, 72,202 new tokens have popped up on Solana using the SPL token standard, according to data from Solscan. That\u2019s over 71 times the amount of coins created on the network during a comparable period in October.\n\nDaily stats for new token creation on Solana are now consistently about four times higher than they\u2019ve ever been since Solana launched in 2020.\n\nWhile the Solana ecosystem has enjoyed a resounding comeback in the last two months\u2014one that\u2019s boosted SOL, Solana NFTs, Solana meme coins, and even demand for the Solana smartphone\u2014such a dramatic spike in token creation likely cannot be explained by organic increases in network activity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNumbers of new SPL tokens created daily in the last three months. Courtesy: Solscan\n\n\u201cMaybe you can assume a doubling or tripling of [new SPL token creation] because of an uptick in general activity,\u201d Slorg, a pseudonymous blockchain investigator and the project lead of Solana NFT tool Sol Incinerator, told Decrypt. \u201cBut how do you account for the other 6,000 tokens a day?\u201d\n\nSlorg got sucked into the conundrum when a fake token for Sol Incinerator recently popped up on Solana. By tracking on-chain transactions, Slorg and their team discovered that the imposter had created dozens of new SOL coins that same day, pumping and dumping each of them within a matter of minutes, before moving on to the next: PUZZ, RUN, BABY DINO, and DEGEN BOT, just to name a few.\n\nToday our team discovered that someone had launched a fake Incinerator token on Birdeye. As we started to dive into the wallet responsible, things became much more interesting. 16 hours ago he sent himself SOL from Binance, which was the first transaction of the chain of\u2026 pic.twitter.com/LToXpQPEYC \u2014 Slorg (@SlorgoftheSlugs) November 13, 2023\n\n\u201cOf these 7,000 tokens being launched daily, a lot of them are these 30-a-day style churn type tokens to farm people watching the \u2018recent\u2019 tab on Birdeye,\u201d Slorg said, referencing the popular crypto trading data aggregator. Slorg tweeted this week that they \"found wallet trails where one guy launched 300 [tokens] himself in a week.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo be clear, not every hyped Solana meme coin is more than an hour-long rugpull. BONK has stuck to its elaborate roadmap (including launching its BonkBot automated trading bot, which is gaining traction); the token was launched by a team including prominent Solana builders and enjoys broad ecosystem support. And Dogwifhat has remained steadily capitalized since its launch last month.\n\nBut the success of some of those tokens, in the context of Solana\u2019s broader resurgence, appears to have attracted enough deployers who\u2014enticed by the prospects of making even a few dollars each gambit\u2014are willing to flood the ecosystem with sham coins.\n\n\u201cA lot of people tell me, \u2018This is the entire point of crypto,\u2019\u201d Slorg said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of demoralizing, because I think we can be so much more.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Google Trends data suggests that Solana's search interest is set to peak during the week of December 24 to 30, with a score of 100.\n\nUsers searching for Solana also showed interest in terms like \"bonk\" and \"tensor.\" Bonk (BONK) is the leading Solana memecoin that reached a peak market cap of $1.9 billion after being listed on Binance and Coinbase, while Tensor is the leading NFT marketplace on Solana, after surpassing Magic Eden in trading volume.\n\nSolana\u2019s DEX Volumes and NFT Sales Surpassed Ethereum\u2019s\n\nOn December 23, Solana surpassed Ethereum in weekly decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and non-fungible token (NFT) sales.\n\nDEX volume on Solana surged to over $10 billion, surpassing Ethereum's $8.8 billion for that week. Meanwhile, Solana also processed $109 million in NFT sales in that week, eclipsing Ethereum by $30 million.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is leading in terms of DEX volumes, with $10.12 billion compared to Solana\u2019s $8.71 billion. However, Solana\u2019s NFT sales volume is still ahead of Ethereum\u2019s, although Bitcoin is leading due to the recent Ordinals frenzy.\n\nThe current frenzy on Solana is partly driven by memecoins, particularly BONK, which has skyrocketed by 300% in December and has a market cap of over $1 billion. Another Solana-based memecoin, Dogwifhat, has also gained 428% in the past week.\n\nSolana Flipped BNB in Market Cap Momentarily\n\nOn December 22, Solana surged by 18% to overtake BNB (BNB), propelling it to 4th place in terms of market capitalization. SOL traded at a market cap of $41.9 billion, surpassing BNB, which had a market cap of $41.8 billion.\n\nThis surge came after SOL overtook XRP in market cap on December 21. However, BNB has since regained its position after gaining over 17% in the past week. BNB is currently trading at a market cap of $47.8 million, compared to SOL\u2019s market cap of $43.7 million.\n\nSOL gained over 71% in the past month, outperforming many large-cap cryptocurrencies such as ETH, which has only gained 12.4%.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Reason Behind Solana\u2019s Recent Rally?\n\nSolana's recent price surge can be attributed to several factors, including:\n\nIncreased User Activity\n\nActive addresses on Solana have increased by nearly 400% in the last three months, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s in mid-November. This suggests an exceptional increase in retail activity, with crypto users likely migrating to Solana for its lower transaction costs, increased speculative activity, airdrop farming and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirdrops and Memecoins Caused Surge in DEX Volume\n\nRecent airdrops on Solana, particularly the Jito (JTO) airdrop worth five figures, have resulted in more users flocking to other Solana-based protocols in hopes of securing a future airdrop. Furthermore, memecoins trading craze, led by the Bonk memecoin, have boosted speculative user activity, causing the DEX volume on Solana to surpass Ethereum\u2019s for a week. Other memecoins on Solana, like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Silly Dragon (SILLY), also saw millions in daily volume on-chain, contributing to the rise in DEX volumes.\n\nInstitutional Capital Flows Into Solana\n\nSource: CoinShares\n\nSolana-based investment funds attracted $156 million in institutional inflows as of December 16, making it the crypto asset with the highest inflows behind only Bitcoin, suggesting robust institutional interest in Solana."

        "content": "WEB3\n\nGalaxy Fox (GFOX), an innovative project combining memecoin allure with play-to-earn gaming, has continued to gain attention in its presale.\n\nToday's headlines are lighting up with the news of Solana's bold move, reclaiming its spot as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. With an impressive 18% surge recently, Solana ($SOL) has soared to $98, marking a significant comeback and pushing Binance Coin ($BNB) to the fifth position with a market cap of more than $41 billion. While the crypto giants engage in this high-stakes reshuffling, the best cheap crypto to buy right now, Galaxy Fox, is quietly making waves with its innovative approach and nearing a $2.1 million valuation for its native token, $GFOX.\n\n$SOL's Remarkable Comeback\n\nThis resurgence is nothing short of remarkable for Solana, considering its tumultuous journey in recent years. After hitting a market cap high of $75 billion in November 2021, Solana faced a significant downturn, plummeting below $10 by the end of 2022. Contributing factors included its association with the collapsed FTX exchange and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nFast forward to the present, and $SOL has risen from the ashes, posting impressive gains of 711.9% year-to-date and 81% in the last 30 days leading to December 28. However, the journey ahead may not be entirely smooth, as this good crypto to buy could encounter resistance at the psychological $100 level. Additionally, competitors like Polygon and BNB Chain might be gearing up for the chase, aiming to close the market cap gap.\n\n$SOL is priced at $110, with a market cap of $47 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nGalaxy Fox Emerges as the Dark Horse with $2.1 Million Valuation\n\nWhile the crypto giants jockey for position, a dark horse has quietly emerged in the form of Galaxy Fox. This best cheap crypto to buy right now is not your average memecoin token. It's a hybrid model that integrates meme coin allure with the practical utility of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming.\n\nGalaxy Fox has not only captured attention for its innovative approach but has also become the talk of the town with its impressive presale numbers. The project, currently in Stage 6, boasts over 1.9 billion tokens in the hands of early investors, with each $GFOX priced at $0.001749. As the next stage looms on the horizon with a token price of $0.00198, things are heating up fast.\n\nGalaxy Fox has reached a milestone of $2.1 million in its presale! This accomplishment underscores the project's momentum, signaling a promising trajectory toward the $2.5 million mark. The deflationary token model, coupled with a token burn mechanism, positions $GFOX as a standout player in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nWhat sets this best upcoming ICO apart is its holistic approach. Beyond the token's value, the project introduces an exhilarating Web3 endless runner game, offering players the chance to earn $GFOX tokens based on their in-game performance. The real game-changer, however, lies in the limited edition Galaxy Fox NFTs, numbering 3,000, which unlock special abilities and enhance gameplay.\n\nToken holders can also stake their $GFOX in the Stargate module, accruing 2% of all ecosystem transactions and enjoying the perks of residual income. With the potential for a 100X upside, Galaxy Fox is not just a memecoin but a multifaceted investment opportunity.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the crypto landscape witnesses seismic shifts, Solana's ascent and Galaxy Fox's $2 million valuation signify the dynamic nature of this industry. While Solana aims to consolidate its position, Galaxy Fox is gearing up for a stellar run in 2024.\n\nDon't miss out on the action. Join the Galaxy Fox community now! Whether you're a seasoned investor or a crypto enthusiast looking for the best cheap crypto to buy right now, the combination of memecoin charm and gaming utility makes $GFOX a standout choice.
