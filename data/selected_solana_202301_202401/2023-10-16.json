        "content": "Despite this decision, Lido still provides staking services for Polygon ( MATIC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ).\n\nIn September, the Lido P2P validator responsible for the Solana blockchain requested financial support from the Lido DAO or, alternatively, the project\u2019s termination. At the time, the validator emphasized that it would be difficult for the project to achieve its objectives without proper funding.\n\n\u201cAfter much discussion and a vote by Lido DAO members, it was decided that the best course of action would be to wind down Lido on Solana.\u201d\n\nThe team revealed that it came to this decision after an extensive DAO forum discussion and a community vote that favored the sunsetting of Lido on Solana.\n\nLido says it would stop accepting deposits for staking Solana effective immediately.\n\nWhile stSOL holders will continue to receive rewards, the team warned that it would terminate support to its Solana frontend by February 2024. After this date, stakers will have to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to unstake their assets.\n\nMeanwhile, node operators can voluntarily start leaving the platform by November 17.\n\nInformation on the protocol\u2019s website showed that the unstaking process might take as much as three days to complete.\n\nLido is the dominant liquid staking protocol enabling users to earn rewards by staking assets on various protocols and blockchains.\n\nAccording to its website, the protocol has staked over $14 billion worth of digital assets and disbursed more than $700 million in rewards. Its Solana platform has staked over 2.3 million SOL, valued at approximately $55 million.\n\nLido\u2019s decision is coming on the heels of a similar one it made in March to end its staking program on the Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama (KSM) blockchains."

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFTX's bankruptcy estate staked roughly $122 million in Solana (SOL) tokens held in the firm's crypto wallets.\n\nThe transaction was tracked through on-chain data when an FTX-identified wallet transferred the tokens to Figment, a staking validator firm catering to institutional investors.\n\nAround the same time early on Saturday, the FTX estate also staked a total of 3,200 Ethereum (ETH) worth roughly $5 million, on-chain data shows.\n\nA Nansen spokesperson told Decrypt that both crypto wallets are Alameda Research wallets, FTX's sister trading firm.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStaking in the world of cryptocurrencies refers to the process of locking up a specific amount of tokens for a predetermined period. In return, holders who participate in staking receive rewards in the form of additional coins. This process plays a vital role in securing proof-of-stake (PoS) networks, such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\nIn August, the FTX\u2019s current leadership helmed by John J. Ray III, filed a motion seeking authorization and approval of guidelines for the sale of cryptocurrencies recovered during the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n\"Hedging of Bitcoin and Ether\u2014two digital assets for which there is a liquid hedging market\u2014will provide a means to lessen the Debtors\u2019 exposure to adverse price movements in Bitcoin and Ether prior to their sale,\" said the filing.\n\nThe FTX estate's request was approved last month, with Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital appointed as the investment manager overseeing the sale of the assets, valued at a whopping $3.4 billion in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and several other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe original motion outlining FTX\u2019s \u201cDigital Asset Management and Monetization Program,\u201d however, also included the possibility of staking certain cryptocurrencies to generate passive yield\u2014the option the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy estate has now executed.\n\nFTX and Digital Galaxy didn\u2019t immediately reply to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nFTX, Alameda and Solana\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently on trial on fraud charges, was a notable advocate of Solana\u2014through Alameda Research, he invested in the project\u2019s developers Solana Labs, as well as other ecosystem projects.\n\nAdditionally, as the Solana Foundation revealed last year, FTX and Alameda Research purchased over 50.5 million SOL from the Foundation in the period between August 2020 and January 2021, with the larger portion of that amount locked until 2028 with a monthly unlock schedule.\n\nSOL soared to an all-time high of $260 in November 2021, however, is currently trading 91% off that peak\n\n\u201cThere were the Sam coins, including Solano [sic] which he didn't create but played a big role in promoting. It was more liquid than the other Sam coins,\u201d Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX\u2019s sister trading firm Alameda Research and the star witness at the ongoing trial of SBF, said last week in court.\n\nNotably, Solana was also FTX\u2019s largest crypto holding at the time of the September court ruling, with as much as $1.16 billion in SOL sitting in the company\u2019s wallets."

He can often be sighted at tech conferences with a strong coffee in one hand and a laptop in the other. If it's geeky, he\u2019s probably into it. Find him on Twitter (@Gadget_Ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nThe Solana Foundation has joined the DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Centre) \u2013 a world-leading free zone and Dubai\u2019s authority on commodities trade and enterprise \u2013 as an ecosystem partner at its Crypto Centre.\n\nThis strategic partnership is set to enhance DMCC\u2019s existing offerings and collaborations by empowering its members to develop innovative concepts and scale their businesses using Solana, one of the industry\u2019s top blockchain platforms.\n\nThe collaboration entails the Solana Foundation offering crucial technical and business development support to members of the Crypto Centre. Furthermore, the Foundation will extend its existing grant programme to DMCC companies, fostering growth and innovation within Dubai\u2019s crypto community.\n\nOne of the key aspects of this collaboration is Solana\u2019s physical presence at the DMCC Crypto Centre.\n\nBy integrating with the Centre\u2019s ecosystem and collaborating with a diverse network of technology partners, exchanges, government entities, investors, incubators, accelerators, and service providers, Solana aims to make the most of Dubai\u2019s crypto-friendly environment. This move will also enable Solana to engage with the broader community of 23,000 companies operating within DMCC\u2019s bustling business district.\n\nAhmed Bin Sulayem, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of DMCC, said:\n\n\u201cSolana is one of the most prominent blockchains in the world, boasting a market capitalisation of $8 billion, placing it in the top 10 largest crypto projects globally. Through this landmark signing, we will provide complimentary set-up and business licensing for Solana ecosystem projects whilst our members can access a world-class blockchain platform and dedicated Solana engineering teams that can take their businesses to new heights. Providing this type of supportive environment is our core philosophy for the DMCC Crypto Centre. It is through this strategy that we have developed one of the most dynamic and value-creating ecosystems for Web3 firms, offering the largest concentration of crypto, blockchain, and Web3 businesses across the MENA region \u2013 and a central driver behind Dubai\u2019s rise into the biggest global Web3 innovation hub.\u201d\n\nDan Albert, Executive Director of Solana Foundation, echoed these sentiments, emphasising the DMCC\u2019s pro-growth attitude and high density of crypto companies as compelling reasons for this collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with members of the Crypto Centre to onboard them to our chain, as well as introducing our existing ecosystem to DMCC so they can also scale their operations,\u201d commented Albert.\n\nThis partnership marks a significant step towards solidifying Dubai\u2019s position as a global hub for Web3 innovation, in stark contrast to countries like the US. The DMCC Crypto Centre is set to play a central role in fostering collaboration, innovation, and growth within the crypto and blockchain sectors.\n\nSee also: Blockchain Expo Europe: PepsiCo on how Web3 modernises enterprises\n\nWant to learn more about blockchain from industry leaders?

        "title": "Lido Exits Solana Following Community Vote - The Defiant - DeFi News",
        "content": "Lido on Solana wasn't projected to being in enough revenue to offset development costs.\n\nBy: Camila Russo \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi\n\nLido, the largest Ethereum staking network, decided to exit the Solana blockchain as revenue that was expected to come in from the operation didn't offset its development and marketing costs.\n\nLido reached the decision to leave the second-largest chain by value staked after a poll on the decision closed with 92.7% of participants voting to sunset operations on the chain.\n\nP2P Validator, the Lido on Solana development team, had so far invested ~$700,000 primarily in development and support. Their revenue during this period was around $220,000, including developer fees and milestone rewards, resulting in a net loss for Lido of ~$484,000, according to a post on the Lido forum.\n\nP2P Validator put forth a proposal to the Lido community suggesting an estimated cost of $1.5M for the next 12 months. This figure was intended to cover various expenses, including a quarterly development retainer of $200,000, an annual adoption incentive program of $600,000 and $100,000 for customer support.\n\nP2P's Expansion Vision\n\nP2P projected that with the proposed funding, Lido on Solana could grow and secure more than 1% of the Solana staking market share.\n\nThe team estimated that a 1% share of the staking market in Solana would result in treasury income of approximately 10,191 SOL over 12 months. At current prices, this amount translates to approximately $200,000.\n\nTotal staked tokens on Solana are worth about $9.35B, compared with $43.7B on Ethereum, according to stakingrewards.com.\n\nCommunity Decision\n\nDespite the potential upside presented by P2P Validator, the Lido community argued the proposal doesn't make economic sense.\n\n\"Why would DAO treasury have exposure to 1.5m USD invest for potential return of 10k SOL,\" wrote a user under the name Marin in the forum. \"Voters need to be aware that it would require 7.6x increase in SOL price for treasury to be at 0.\"\n\nA forum commenter by the user name of btuck added that the Solana Foundation hasn't been supportive of liquid staking.\n\n\"Solana Foundation isn\u2019t supporting liquid staking with their own SOL yet, and there is also a significant amount of locked SOL (~60M) that is not eligible either,\" they wrote. \"And Solana DeFi needs to be tested further for big accounts to really trust them with size.\"\n\nBlessing for Competitors\n\nWith Lido bowing out of the Solana ecosystem, the competitive landscape clears up for liquid staking projects Marinade Finance and Jito, both of which have incentive programs in place to attract users, analyst DeFi Ignas wrote on X/Twitter.\n\n\"In fact, Jito has been growing faster thanks to the Jito Points airdr0p system where you get points not only for holding JitoSOL but actively using it in DeFi for providing LP or lending,\" DeFi Ignas wrote.\n\nSunsetting Process\n\nstSOL token holders will still receive network rewards during the sunsetting process but will only be able to unstake via the Lido on Solana frontend until Feb. 4, 2024. Afterward, unstaking will need to be done through its command-line interface.\n\nNode operators will be provided voluntary off-boarding instructions via Lido community channels.\n\nThe key dates of the sunsetting process are as follows:\n\nOctober 16, 2023: Lido on Solana staking will be discontinued, and no new stakes will be accepted.\n\nNovember 17, 2023: The voluntary node operator off-boarding process will begin.\n\nFebruary 4, 2024: The Lido on Solana frontend support will be concluded. After this point, unstaking will only feasible via the Command Line Interface (CLI).\n\nLido's discontinuation on Solana marks an end of a significant chapter, though the optimism for Solana's potential remains high amongst the Lido contributors."
