        "content": "00:00\n\nThis year, you know, there's been a lot of excitement again around Solana. Some of it, I think may be due to Bonk, which is a little bit silly, but still fun to talk about. A lot of it due to Saga, which is a new phone that you've come out. Talk to us about what what you make of the price action. Well, I don't really focus on price, but I think the thing that is exciting, as you mentioned, like bomb also and FTSE is these may look like toys to know casual passer by, but they are stress testing, real financial infrastructure that supports very serious use cases like helium that migrated to Salina from its own block chain as a million and a half hot spots around the world that create a decentralized five g network that's much cheaper for your average user to sign up to. And even new applications like high mapper that couldn't exist without Solana's performance. Google API is for maps or one of the most expensive in the world, and this is a decentralized version of that where drivers are populating it and earning money tokens through through dash cams. So, you know, these toys are kind of the most visible and viral thing. They're sort of like the tick tock videos of crypto. But underneath, it's really stress testing the emperor. All right. So in terms of stress testing, you know, we have seen network breakdowns in the past, kind of cast a shadow over the asset. We have seen, you know, frustration over congestion, frustration over gas fees. I mean, on the theory and block chain, I think one user paid like one hundred and sixty thousand dollars for one transaction. What are you seeing as the result of these stress tests on your block chain? Yeah. So it's important to delineate between high fees, which for most users could be considered unavailability or an average. And then, you know, halting a block reduction. So on Solana, the fees never really go up substantially. Nowhere near one hundred fifty six thousand dollars, which is that transaction you on May 8 on Solana? It's about 10 dollars for a million transactions. And it's always been that way at this point. Most performance, high performance kind of next generation block chains have had some outages a lot in the last 70 days. It's had 100 percent uptime even through multiple of these use cases spiking in parallel. So a lot of fun. I went through the gauntlet earlier than most. We saw the largest influxes of hundreds of thousands of users concurrently bot spamming the network. High frequency trading firms really trying to get at these assets and flip them in the last year. And now it's quite battle hardened with things like local fee markets that we see on networks like Miriam. They're having their first outages for the first time in the last week. And in the times that they are working, the larger ones are very, very expensive. So, you know, our thesis is that that has been a big prohibitive factor in onboarding normal users that maybe just have one hundred dollars or three thousand dollars to play with in crypto. And that's one of the issues we're very focused on solving. OK, so that's kind of the average user or the smaller users, I do wonder about your marquee users or clients, because of course we all know about the relationship that did exist between Alameda and FTSE and Solana. In the absence of that, who are your marquee clients now? How are you attracting them? If you had difficulty in that. I think the network effects of Solana have gotten to a point where, you know, I don't have to have a conversation with really impressive builders, investors and participants in the financial ecosystem. Nobody at Solana Foundation really needs to do things like render. It's a very big established render network that's used in Hollywood for opening scenes of things like Game of Thrones. They have a decentralized network of GP use and a marketplace for accessing them. And that community voted to move to Solana on its own volition. Same thing with helium and same thing with builders like I've mapper. What we see with institutionalise is I think across the whole industry there is sort of a pullback and a lot of hesitancy, as you guys discussed with with Nick Carter earlier. That's something that's on is not immune to. But this is why the thesis for Salon has always been a focus on, you know, just an order of magnitude or more of a larger user base and what it takes to build a product that normal people actually can use. And we're seeing that happen now. Salon has got the most daily active addresses of any network at around 500000, which is still low, but it's consistently high for a blocking network. And finally, just looking toward the future, A.I. is now the buzzword of the year. It seems how is the one labs thinking about artificial intelligence? How do you see this fitting fitting into the future? Ultimately. Sure. I think as with most verticals, it's multifaceted. So I mentioned render earlier those Leighton GP you implies people's houses and their computers that are getting activated for the render network. They can be used not just for or jobs, but for also training and inference on on A.I. networks. So a lot of labs also launched a plug in projects CBT for accessing the network. This is just another step in making it that much easier to interact with the brain and feel like you're maybe speaking to an advisor or a co-pilot pilot that's helping you navigate the chain and its assets. I think we're still at very early stages. Some of the most exciting but surprising stuff is what comes out of NAFTA. These are brands that have ambitions to become the next Disney or Marvel. And using AI to populate the characters, the story, the law and even generate some of the art are very early stages.

        "title": "Best Crypto Portfolio Trackers [2023] - Nansen",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nAs the cryptocurrency and DeFi ecosystem continues to expand across multiple blockchains and protocols, tracking your investments becomes increasingly challenging. Investors often use different exchanges, blockchains, and protocols while holding assets on various platforms. Portfolio trackers have become essential for serious cryptocurrency investors. With the right tracker, you can easily monitor your holdings and manage asset allocation across different wallets and chains.\n\nIn this article, we will explore what to look out for when choosing a crypto and DeFi portfolio tracker and provide a curated list of the best trackers available for various use cases.\n\nThings to look out for in a crypto and DeFi portfolio tracker\n\nA good portfolio tracker should have:\n\nComprehensive blockchain and protocol coverage. This ensures that all your assets and DeFi positions are reflected and tracked, allowing you to seamlessly manage asset allocation across multiple chains and protocols. Multi-wallet bundling. If you\u2019re looking for a portfolio tracker, odds are you\u2019re using multiple crypto wallets. The ability to get aggregated overviews of your holdings across multiple wallets becomes vital. Multi-chain transaction history. Helps you monitor and analyze transactions made without having to open countless block explorers. Relevant niche features. Depending on your use case, you might require specific niche features such as tax accounting.\n\nThere are other features that matter as well, but in most cases, the ones mentioned above would be the differentiating factors among the countless trackers available today. Now that you know what to look out for, here's a list of the best crypto portfolio trackers, along with their pros and cons.\n\nNansen Portfolio\n\nNansen Portfolio is the most comprehensive crypto and DeFi portfolio tracker for crypto natives, and it's completely free. You can effortlessly track your crypto holdings and DeFi positions by simply entering your wallet address or ENS domain, without the need for email sign-up or downloading an application. One significant feature it has over the others in the list is the ability to track any crypto wallet, not just your own, allowing you to monitor the on-chain activity of investors or traders that interest you. However, investors who mainly interact with centralized exchanges and aren't into DeFi might find the other trackers on the list more suitable for their use case.\n\nKey features\n\nWide coverage of blockchains and DeFi protocols\n\nNansen Portfolio has coverage of 47 chains and over 400 protocols. The chains covered span both EVM and non-EVM chains such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Cosmos, Solana, Osmosis, and Bitcoin, just to name a few. Alternative trackers such as DeBank and Zapper offer less coverage and might be insufficient if you\u2019re actively investing and yield farming on chains that they don\u2019t support.\n\nThe large number of protocols supported is crucial as a DeFi investor since yield farming positions are typically not easily trackable in an aggregated format. Having a view of all positions in one place is essential for easily monitoring them at once.\n\nMulti-wallet bundling of any group of addresses, not just yours\n\nUsers are able to easily bundle wallet addresses from different chains into a single portfolio and get aggregated views of their token holdings, DeFi positions and even NFTs. There are no limits to the number of portfolios that you can create as well. This allows you to easily monitor and track the crypto portfolios of whales, entities or addresses that you\u2019re interested in, on top of your own crypto portfolio.\n\nMulti-chain transaction history\n\nThe transactions tab shows transactions that the wallets have made across 11 chains. This gives you the ability to monitor transactions made in one single view instead of going to individual block explorers and having multiple tabs open.\n\nList of chains supported in the transactions tab: Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Aurora, Moonbeam, Cronos, Moonriver, Optimism.\n\nNo email required\n\nAnonymity is something that many crypto native investors value. All you have to do to access all of the features mentioned above is to connect your crypto wallet.\n\nCoinGecko/CoinMarketCap\n\nEveryone\u2019s favorite crypto price tracking tools also includes a crypto portfolio tracker. Both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap\u2019s portfolio trackers have similar functionalities but with slight differences between them. If you\u2019re already constantly checking CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap for prices of cryptocurrencies, utilizing their portfolio trackers might be a convenient option for you. However, the trackers aren\u2019t built to track DeFi positions and active DeFi participants would likely require a tracker like Nansen Portfolio to monitor all their positions.\n\nKey Features\n\nManual Entry\n\nBoth trackers largely require you to manually enter the number of tokens purchased and the price of purchase. Although this takes time and can be a hassle, both trackers allow you to add even the most obscure tokens, giving you an accurate way to track your portfolio\u2019s profit and loss in a manner much more convenient than managing your own Excel sheet. You\u2019re able to add notes alongside the transactions to provide context and for niche use cases such as tax reporting.\n\nOne key difference between CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap's trackers is that CoinMarketCap allows you to sign in using certain crypto wallets such as MetaMask and Trust Wallet, while for CoinGecko, you have to use an email to create an account. CoinMarketCap also allows you to sync your Binance account to the tracker.\n\nDelta\n\nDelta allows you to track your holdings across multiple asset classes such as crypto and equities all in one app. It\u2019s suitable for crypto investors who largely trade and invest on centralized exchanges. However, the lack of DeFi portfolio tracking will be a deal breaker for the more crypto-native investors.\n\nKey Features\n\nComprehensive asset overviews\n\nDelta allows you to integrate your exchange accounts, making it simple to keep track of your portfolio holdings across multiple asset classes.\n\nManual entry\n\nIn the event that you\u2019re unable to integrate your wallets or exchange accounts directly with Delta, you\u2019re able to manually enter your holdings and keep track of their performance on the app.\n\nCoinStats\n\nCoinStats is a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker and management app that enables users to monitor their cryptocurrency holdings, track market prices, and analyze portfolio performance. With real-time data on thousands of cryptocurrencies, integration with popular exchanges and wallets, and features like price alerts and news aggregation, CoinStats offers a comprehensive solution for effectively managing and tracking cryptocurrency investments in one place. Its mobile app further allows users to access their portfolios and market data conveniently on iOS and Android devices.\n\nKey features\n\nComprehensive exchange and crypto wallet integration\n\nCoinStats has integrations with over 70 platforms, across centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance and crypto wallets such as MetaMask and WalletConnect. This allows you to easily connect all of your holdings across various platforms into one aggregated dashboard.\n\nHowever, you can only connect up to 10 platforms and view 1,000 historical transactions for free. To get unlimited platform connections and track up to 1 million transactions, you\u2019ll have to subscribe to the premium tier which cost $9.90 a month.\n\nPurchase Cryptocurrencies\n\nOn top of tracking your portfolio on CoinStats, you can directly purchase cryptocurrencies on the platform. Purchases can be done using cryptocurrencies via 1inch\u2019s DEX or using Fiat powered by Ramp or MoonPay.\n\nTax Reports\n\nAlthough not natively done within CoinStats, the platform has partnered with CoinLedger to offer a tax report generation service. Do note that the tax report generation is not free but CoinStats users get a 10% discount.\n\nKoinly\n\nCoinStats is a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker and management app that enables users to monitor their cryptocurrency holdings, track market prices, and analyze portfolio performance. With real-time data on thousands of cryptocurrencies, integration with popular exchanges and wallets, and features like price alerts and news aggregation, CoinStats offers a comprehensive solution for effectively managing and tracking cryptocurrency investments in one place. Its mobile app further allows users to access their portfolios and market data conveniently on iOS and Android devices.\n\nKey Features\n\nComprehensive exchange and crypto wallet integration\n\nKoinly has integrations with over 400 crypto exchanges and over 100 crypto wallets, allowing you to easily import and sync your transactions and holdings. It\u2019s free tier allows you to connect an unlimited number of exchanges and wallets and track up to 10,000 transactions.\n\nCrypto tax reports\n\nBy subscribing to the \u201cNewbie\u201d tier list, which costs $49/year, you get access to automated and highly in-depth tax reports. This allows you to easily fulfil any regulatory requirements relevant to your tax jurisdiction.\n\nWrapping up\n\nTracking your crypto holdings and positions is becoming more complex as the industry expands. The list above provides a comprehensive overview of the top portfolio trackers available in the market today. Ultimately, the value and benefits of each tracker depend on your investing patterns and requirements. Crypto-native investors actively involved in DeFi yield farming or with a majority of their portfolios in self-custody would find Nansen Portfolio highly suitable. Additionally, users interested in monitoring and tracking wallet addresses they do not own will also find significant value in a portfolio tracker like Nansen Portfolio.\n\n\u200d"
