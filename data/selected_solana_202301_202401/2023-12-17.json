        "content": "Aurory purchased the stolen funds back from the hacker on a decentralized exchange\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi\n\nAurory, a Solana-based Pokemon-inspired web3 game, lost around $830,000 worth of its native tokens to a bridge exploit.\n\nOn Dec. 17, the project reported that a hacker had compromised the \u201cbuy endpoint\u201d for its Aurory Marketplace, allowing the attacker to increase their balance of AURY tokens in SyncSpace \u2014 Aurory\u2019s \u201chybrid on-chain/off-chain inventory system\u201d that also facilitates asset bridging between Solana and Arbitrum.\n\nThe perpetrator behind the exploit was able to siphon 600,000 AURY (worth $830,000 at the time) from an Aurory team-controlled wallet. The tokens were moved to Arbitrum for sale via the Camelot decentralized exchange.\n\nAurory responded by taking SyncSpace offline to patch the vulnerability, and used its market maker to purchase all of the stolen AURY. Liquidity for the AURY/USDC pool on Camelot fell 80% from $1.5M amid the incident.\n\n\u201cThe exploiter does not have any more AURY left to sell,\u201d Aurory tweeted. \u201cWe swiftly moved to absorb sell pressure through our market maker and through pool rebalancing.\u201d\n\nAurory emphasized that no user assets were impacted and there is no threat of further losses. The AURY token is down 20% since the exploit began, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAurory said it will restore SyncSwap functionality \u201cin the coming days\u201d after the vulnerability has been patched. The exploit occurred despite Aurory previously engaging Ottersec, a web3 security firm, for code auditing. Aurory integrated support for Arbitrum via SyncSpace in July.\n\nCross-chain bridges have proved to be a pervasive risk within the web3 ecosystem. According to Rekt, four of the five largest DeFi exploits targeted bridges, with Ronin, Poly Network, BNB Bridge, and Wormhole losing more than $2.1B in assets combined."

        "content": "The Solana (SOL)-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter (JUP) will be airdropping a billion of its tokens early next year, according to its founder.\n\nJupiter\u2019s founder, who pseudonymously goes by Meow, says on the social media platform X that out of the 10 billion JUP tokens that will eventually be minted, half of them will go to the community and half to the Jupiter team.\n\nSpecifically, 40% of the 10 billion tokens will be reserved for four rounds of community airdrops, the first of which is expected to take place in January.\n\n\u201cTokenomics reflect the ethos of a project, and our key ethos is as simple as it gets \u2013 for a project like Jupiter, there needs to be an equal weight between a focused entity able to constantly recruit world-class talent, build product, and execute strategy, and a wider community able to fact-check, counterweight, and help to course-correct.\n\nAs such, the 10 billion JUP will be 50% managed by the team, 50% distributed to the community. Perfectly balanced, as all cats should be.\u201d\n\nMeow says the Jupiter team sees itself as a \u201cfull-stack ecosystem push to help the Solana and crypto ecosystem win.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe Solana is the best blockchain for onboarding the next billion users. And when we draw people to using JUP, they also end up using everything else on Solana.\n\nAnd when we have a full set of powerful trading products that work as well as their centralized counterparts, they have no reason to go back to CEXes.\n\nAnd when there is a critical mass of use cases and fun stuff you can do on-chain, there will be increasingly fewer reasons to pull your capital out.\u201d\n\nAccording to the founder, more details on the airdrop and JUP liquidity provision will be revealed in the coming weeks.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a jaw-dropping turn of events, the Solana Saga phone, launched earlier this year at a modest $600, has seen an astonishing 500% price surge on eBay, now commanding a staggering $3,000 and even more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe catalyst behind this unprecedented rise is none other than the Solana-based meme token, BonkInu (BONK), which has witnessed an astronomical 19,103% surge since October.\n\nWhat's the connection between a blockchain phone and a meme token? It turns out that each Solana Saga phone owner is entitled to a whopping 30 million BONKs, turning the device into an unexpected windfall. At the peak of BonkInu's meteoric rise, this translated to a cool $1,000 victory for the lucky phone owners.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING: @solana SAGA phone selling for over $2,000 on the eBay Store. pic.twitter.com/HXUdeRgCSz \u2014 SolanaFloor | Powered by Step Finance (@SolanaFloor) December 17, 2023\n\nAnticipating further gains as Solana and BONK continue their upward trajectory, enthusiasts are snatching up the limited edition phones in the hopes of experiencing a token airdrop similar to the one orchestrated by the BonkInu team earlier this year.\n\nAdding to the craze, Solend, a prominent DeFi platform, and meme token Samoyed Coin (SAMO) have announced exclusive promotions for Saga owners, further fueling the buying spree.\n\nCollector's item\n\nWhat sets the Solana Saga phone apart is its scarcity \u2014 only around 20,000 units were ever produced. This limited run has transformed the Solana Saga into a coveted collector's item, intensifying its allure and, consequently, its price surge.\n\nThis unexpected success story at the intersection of traditional technology and the burgeoning digital economy has left many astonished. Initially dismissed as a whimsical foray by Solana into the smartphone market, the Solana Saga phone has defied expectations, proving that in the crypto market, even the most unconventional ventures can lead to remarkable and profitable outcomes."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nSolana [SOL] has witnessed a surge in value unseen since July-August 2022, thanks to the ongoing rally. In fact, despite bouts of bearish movements, the altcoin has done well over the last few months. It was exchanging hands at $76.41, at the time of writing, and experts are hoping for it to trade closer to $90 in the coming weeks.\n\nEven otherwise, Solana has been in the news a lot recently on the back of BONK doing well and the memecoin being listed on Coinbase. Additionally, not only did SOL hit a new 18-month high, but interest in its NFT ecosystem is peaking too.\n\nOnce notorious for its outages, Solana claimed in July to have not suffered any outages since February. In fact, Solana\u2019s developer Jacob Creech recently announced a $400,000 bounty for anyone who could turn Solana off.\n\nFyi there\u2019s a $400k reward for anyone that can find code that can turn off Solana Please go ahead and find ithttps://t.co/2oxcB0EEyx \u2014 Jacob Creech (@jacobvcreech) October 12, 2023\n\nSolana\u2019s reputation as an \u201cEthereum killer\u201d\n\nEven as SOL is touted to be the \u201cEthereum [ETH] killer,\u201d Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko seems to be in agreement with the idea of using Ethereum as a layer-2 for the Solana blockchain.\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security. In this setup, holders of solana assets on ethereum would have finality guarantees that they can exit back\u2026 https://t.co/XE5ETsxGIW \u2014 toly ?? (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nEven Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is an admirer of the Solana protocol. When the SEC sued Binance [BNB] and Coinbase [COIN] in early June, it labeled several altcoins, including SOL, as securities. Buterin rued the manner in which the regulator is targeting projects like Solana.\n\nThe one comment I\u2019ll make is that I feel bad that @solana and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don\u2019t deserve it, and if ethereum ends up \u201cwinning\u201d through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 30, 2023\n\nHeading into 2023, SOL was hovering around the $10 support zone. It was already in the grips of a downtrend that stretched back to November 2021, back when SOL was trading at $200.\n\nWe asked ChatGPT for its take on the price, network health, and the trajectory of Solana after giving it some relevant data points.\n\nCan we coax ChatGPT into a Solana price prediction?\n\nChatGPT has been a remarkable chatbot, and the updates of the past month have made ChatGPT 4.0 quite impressive. It is a powerful tool for learning and well-trained on a vast array of topics. Yet, we must remember that the bot is engineered to mimic a human, and is not necessarily guaranteed to be factually accurate.\n\nThe jailbreak version of ChatGPT would likely be even more inaccurate, as it is specifically instructed not to say no to anything the user requests.\n\nAnd yet, it is possible to obtain some guesses from the chatbot on what the future might hold if we provide it with details about recent price movements.\n\nSo, what does ChatGPT make of Solana? Does it see a route to recovery after its recent setbacks? Based on transaction fees and transaction speeds, ChatGPT seems to think Solana will be an Ethereum killer.\n\nWe are yet to inform it of the challenges that Solana and SOL investors have faced in recent months. Let\u2019s start with the biggest dent in investor confidence \u2013\n\nFTX\u2014where the free fall began\n\nSam Bankman-Fried \u201cSBF\u201d was one of the most vocal proponents of the Solana network. The community saw him as a credible and smart entrepreneur who was the CEO of one of the largest crypto exchanges, FTX.\n\nEven though Binance reigned supreme in terms of volume and token pairs, FTX was giving it a run for its money. Competition is also good for the industry and serves the customers.\n\nA lot has changed since then as there is a trial going on against SBF. It has been alleged he commingled FTX customer funds with those of Alameda Research to make undisclosed venture investments. He could face years in jail if convicted on all counts.\n\nNot only did the reputation of Solana take a hit, but the foundation also sold a significant amount of SOL to FTX Trading and Alameda Research. This amounted to 58.08 million SOL, or 11% of the circulating supply at the time FTX filed for bankruptcy. It was valued at close to $1.1 billion at the time.\n\nAs expected, the price of Solana nosedived in November and declined by 45% from November 11 to 31 December, falling from $18.08 to $8. With rumors of FTX\u2019s insolvency circulating from November 5, SOL had already lost 50% the previous week, when it was trading near the $38 mark.\n\nThis took SOL\u2019s total losses from 5 November 2022 to 31 December 2022 to 79.4%.\n\nChatGPT certainly sounds optimistic, and early 2023 went extraordinarily well for investors. And yet, some network issues cropped up, just as they had in 2022.\n\nSOL exceeded expectations in January and February 2023\n\nFrom 1 January to 20 February, Solana gained by 179.88% on the price charts and rallied from $9.69 to $27.12. The explosive rally has been credited partially to Bonk; a meme coin introduced within the Solana ecosystem modeled after Shiba Inu.\n\nA part of the total 99 trillion supply was airdropped into the wallets of Solana users in December. The transaction count per day was on a downtrend in the second half of December, but this turned around in early January.\n\nSoon enough, the transactions were picking up pace once more. The introduction of the fun memecoin did much to bring the community away from the dark, depressing shadow the FTX debacle had cast on Solana.\n\nWhen fed with on-chain data and price action in recent months, the jailbroken version of ChatGPT predicted that SOL\u2019s price will reach $800 by the end of Q4.\n\nWe also asked the chatbot about Solana\u2019s outages in the past which might hurt investor confidence.\n\nPredictions aside, what does price analysis tell us about Solana?\n\nA look at Solana\u2019s on-chart metrics\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $76.41, having appreciated by over 135% in just over a month.\n\nSolana\u2019s indicators underlined the said bullishness. While the Parabolic SAR\u2019s dotted markers were under the price candles, the MACD was diverging away from the Signal line after the brief threat of a bearish crossover.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nSimply put, ChatGPT thinks very highly of Solana and expects it to hit new highs in 2024. Even so, let\u2019s not forget that the AI bot is a computer program. Ergo, traders are advised to do their own research before investing in the crypto-asset."
