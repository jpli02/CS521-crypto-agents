        "content": "Since the start of December, Solana\u2019s daily stablecoin transfer volume has grown 600% to $16.6 billion and now outpaces major blockchain networks, according to Artemis, an institutional crypto data platform.\n\nSolana's daily stablecoin transfer volume has risen 600% to $16.6 billion in the month of Dec. 2023.\n\nSolana has taken the lead in daily stablecoin transfer volume for the first time in the layer 1 blockchain\u2019s history.\n\nRead more: Circle\u2019s Euro-Backed Stablecoin $EURC Goes Live on Solana\n\nOn Monday, daily stablecoin transfer volume on Solana had reached $16.6 billion, outpacing other major blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Tron, BNB Chain and Arbitrum, according to Artemis, an institutional crypto data platform. Solana\u2019s stablecoin transfer volume has soared about 600% since the start of the month when it stood at nearly $2.4 billion.\n\n\n\nSolana\u2019s daily stablecoin transfer volume in 2022 ranged from as little as $33 million to as high as $743 million, never exceeding $1 billion. During the bull market of 2021, Solana\u2019s daily stablecoin transfer volume reached $7.1 billion, its previous highest level before this month.\n\n\n\nThe growth in Solana\u2019s stablecoin transfer volume underscores heightened activity and liquidity in the layer 1 blockchain\u2019s ecosystem over the past year. Circle, the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), announced yesterday that decentralized finance applications and digital wallets on Solana can now use Euro Coin (EURC), a stablecoin pegged one-to-one with the euro.\n\nStablecoins are digital assets used on blockchains and pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar to bring stability to the crypto ecosystem, widely known for its price volatility.\n\n\u201cGrowth was kickstarted by the JTO airdrop [on Dec. 7],\u201d wrote Nirmal Krishnan, head of engineering at Artemis, in an email to Unchained. \u201cSOL has flipped Ethereum on both [DEX & NFT trading volume] in the last few days.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAdditionally, the growth of memecoins like BONK and WIF, which have historically never played out on Solana, has created room for more retail activity. Ultimately, I do think the combination of these factors has resulted in significantly more on-chain activity, with Solana reaching its highest daily active address numbers since summer of \u201922.\u201d"

        "content": "Solana (SOL) has undeniably emerged as a standout performer in the recent cryptocurrency landscape, showcasing a remarkable surge in value that has captured the attention of market participants.\n\nIts extraordinary performance, marked by substantial gains, has propelled Solana beyond the ranks of other leading cryptocurrencies, securing a coveted position among the top five by market capitalization.\n\nSolana\u2019s Surge: Outshining Rivals, Proving Dominance\n\nThe impressive rally of Solana stands as a testament to the blockchain\u2019s underlying strength and the growing confidence of investors in its capabilities.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThis bullish momentum has not only allowed SOL to outshine some of the traditionally dominant cryptocurrencies but has also affirmed its relevance and potential within the broader digital asset ecosystem.\n\nThe daily user activity on Solana has increased as a result of this outstanding performance. As the year\u2019s final quarter draws to a close, the most recent statistics reveals a noteworthy growth of about 400%. According to a recent study by on-chain data company Messari, this far outpaced Ethereum\u2019s pitiful 3% gain.\n\nSource: Messari\n\nThe research firm claims that several protocols located within the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain network have completed a series of token airdrops, which is what is responsible for the recent rise in new demand for Solana.\n\nOn December 16th, the trading volume of decentralized exchanges (DEX) on Solana temporarily surpassed that of Ethereum for the first time. This occurred as the smart-contract-enabled blockchain ecosystem continued to expand.\n\nSolana currently trading at $76.7377K territory. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAccording to data from DeFillama, Ethereum\u2019s trading volume during that time was only $1.164 billion, whereas the trading volume of DEXs on the blockchain surpassed $1.5 billion.\n\nBitfinex Cheers Solana\n\nOne of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, Bitfinex, recently tweeted about Solana\u2019s expansion. The tweet claims that in the previous three months alone, SOL\u2019s price has increased by more than 340%.\n\nGood morning, @Solana fam! \u2600\ufe0f Today\u2019s a great day to celebrate the 343% growth of $SOL. From $19.80 per SOL 3 months ago to $67.94 today! Stay bullish.https://t.co/Ltajh1l15C \u2014 Bitfinex (@bitfinex) December 18, 2023\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThree months later, the token\u2019s value had increased to $67.94 from $19.80 at the start of its bull surge.\n\nAs this developed, Jupiter, one of the biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on Solana and a swap aggregator, revealed that its much awaited 4 billion JUP token airdrop would happen in January.\n\n$SOL is on a tear. For the first time since 2021, the SOL/ETH price ratio saw a strong reversal as the Solana network recovers from the devastating collapse of FTX. pic.twitter.com/hAlCC23Yq0 \u2014 Kaiko (@KaikoData) December 19, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, data analytics provider Kaiko said Solana is seeing a sharp increase in price, and the price ratio of SOL to ETH is strongly reversing.\n\nThe Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH) ratio is close to 0.04, according to a post on X published on December 19. Prior highs were around 0.06 in 2021 and lows were at 0.01 in early 2023.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of SOL is currently trading at $77.40, up 3.5% over the last day and rallying 17% over the last week, data from CoinMarketCap shows.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock"
