        "content": "Solana Price Analysis:: Amid the recent correction in the crypto market, the falling Solana price resonated between the two converging trendlines of the falling wedge pattern. In its core concept, this chart setup signals a gradual decrease in bearish momentum, which eventually offers trend control in buyers\u2019 hands. A bullish breakout from this pattern signals the end of the prevailing correction phase or the start of a new recovery rally.\n\nAlso Read: Solana (SOL) Price Sees Strong Performance, While Fantom (FTM) And Collateral Network (COLT) Remain Investor Favorites\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana Price Daily Chart\n\nA bullish breakout from the long-coming resistance trendline signals a shift in market sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips\n\nA potential rally in Solana price may face overhead supply at $21.7 and $24.\n\nThe 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $277.5 Million, indicating a 148% gain.\n\nSource-Tradingview\n\nOn May 25th, the Solana price gave a massive breakout from the resistance trendline of the wedge pattern. After facing multiple rejections from this dynamic resistance in the last five weeks, this breakout signifies the weapon of sellers has been breached the buyers can wrestle to take trend control.\n\nAs of now, the Solana price trades at $20.67 with an intraday gain of $1.17. This follow-up green candle indicates the bullish momentum is aggressive and thus adds more conviction to coin holders.\n\nHowever, the coin price witnessed a minor pullback to retest the breached trendline as potential support. If the buyers manage to sustain above the reclaimed trendline, the potential rally could reach the $26 mark, a projection of a 26% growth potential.\n\nWill Solana Price Reach $26?\n\nThe completion of the wedge pattern has set the Solana price for a massive recovery. However, in the core concept, each swing high during the pattern formation is a valid target for buyers after the breakout. Thus, the SOL price may witness in between hurdles like $21.25 and $24 before hitting the $26 high\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: A bullish crossover between the MACD(blue) and the signal(orange) projects a sign of trend reversal.\n\nExponential Moving Average: The 50-and-100-day EMA moving near the $21.17 mark creates a high supply zone against buyers."

        "content": "As some crypto companies gain mainstream adoption through partnerships, alliances or deals with big brand names, others are operating by the beat of their own drum and not worrying about whether a big label is with them.\n\nSolana, a layer-1 blockchain that launched in 2020, is one of the biggest chains that developers are building on. Excluding stablecoins, Solana is the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at around $7.6 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cSolana has the potential to be the Apple of crypto,\u201d co-founder Raj Gokal told TechCrunch+. For many years, Apple focused on two things: user experience and performance, he said. \u201cI think about Apple, having worked for close to a decade on latency for touchscreens to allow for the iPhone to come out and it just felt like magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of things to be built on top of that platform to get the iPhone and App Store and app ecosystem to where it is today,\u201d Gokal added. \u201cBut it all started with one relentless focus on a simple interaction that had to work perfectly.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s a focus that Solana\u2019s core engineering and ecosystem has, he said. It\u2019s important to create a network \u201cthat feels like the regular internet, when it\u2019s an entirely new financial internet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that Solana may be trying to compete with Apple through its own web3-focused Android smartphone, Saga, which was rolled out to the public in April (I got to test one out). Solana says Saga was launched to make crypto products and services more accessible for users by offering them through a phone instead of the traditional way of accessing crypto platforms and applications: using computers.\n\nThere\u2019s lots that the network is doing to keep itself fresh and competitive. \u201cThe core thesis is going to be [focused on] new businesses, new projects, independent developers,\u201d Gokal said. \u201cWe are still in an ecosystem and a community that is optimistic about what two developers in a garage can do.\u201d\n\nFor example, Tensor, which is one of the largest Solana-focused NFT marketplaces, gained significant traction within the first year of launching.
