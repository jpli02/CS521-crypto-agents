        "content": "Solana (SOL) has emerged as one of the best-performing cryptos in 2023. Since January, the token has risen by over 500%, more than triple Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 124% growth in the same time frame. SOL\u2019s growth this year is especially commendable, given that it was one of the worst-affected projects due to the collapse of FTX in November 2022.\n\nAlso Read: Solana: SOL Continues to See Fund Inflows as Price Spikes 36%\n\nHowever, this might not be the end of SOL\u2019s incredible run. According to OpenAi\u2019s AI (Artificial Intelligence) chatbot, ChatGPT, the token might rise 700% in 2024. According to the chatbot, SOL could hit a price of $500 as early as next year.\n\nWhat will push Solana\u2019s price in 2024?\n\nSource \u2013 Wealth Mastery\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, bullish market trends and widespread adoption of Solana\u2019s blockchain technology will push its price in 2024. Moreover, reaching $500 would mean over 90% growth from SOL\u2019s all-time high of $259, which it attained in November 2021.\n\nAdditionally, investment firm VanEck has predicted a bullish outlook for SOL in the long run. The firm anticipates the crypto to surge by 7600% by the end of this decade. Meanwhile, VanEck expects Ethereum (ETH) to reach a price of $11,800, a growth of about 475% from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Solana (SOL) Could Surge 7600% by 2030: Predicts VanEck.\n\nAdditionally, analysts and experts expect another bull run for the crypto market in early 2024. Bitcoin (BTC) will undergo its next halving cycle in April 2024, which is considered bullish for the market. Moreover, industry experts anticipate that the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) will approve a spot BTC ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) in 2024. Both developments could usher in another bull run, like that of late-2021. BTC and other major cryptos, such as Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), etc., might hit new all-time highs."

        "content": "PYTH announced an airdrop of around 250 million tokens.\n\nThe Solana network saw a surge in the number of new token addresses.\n\nA newly introduced token on the Solana [SOL] network recently conducted an airdrop for eligible users. This event had effects on some key metrics within the Solana ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, it is interesting to see how the network managed this latest development as the number of users increased.\n\nPYTH on Solana\n\nOn 20th November, Pyth, a decentralized finance (DeFi) oracle network, initiated an airdrop for its PYTH token. Notably built on the Solana blockchain, the airdrop attracted attention and interest in the Solana network.\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap, the self-reported circulating supply of the PYTH token was around 1.5 billion, with a total supply of 10 billion.\n\nReportedly, around 250 million tokens were allocated for the airdrop. In light of these developments, how did the Solana network respond to this event?\n\nVolume and fees see uptrends on Solana\n\nAn analysis of the volume chart on DefiLlama revealed a recent rise in Solana\u2019s trading activity. On 20th November, coinciding with the airdrop announcement, the volume rose to around $392 million.\n\nAs of this writing, there has been a continued rise in volume over the last 24 hours, surpassing $490 million. Notably, the highest volume observed in recent months was around $466 million on 11h November.\n\nIn addition to increased trading volume, the network\u2019s fees have also increased in the past few days.\n\nNotably, on 20th November, the total fees reached over $130,000, marking the highest point in the year. As of this writing, fees in the last 24 hours have remained high and were around $123,000.\n\nThe data suggested a remarkable impact on the network. This is considering the increased volume and fees coinciding with the PYTH token airdrop.\n\nNew token addresses surge as network remains stable\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of Solscan showed that the recent developments have had a notable impact on the new token chart.\n\nThe analysis highlighted a substantial increase in the number of new token accounts. Over the past three months, the peak number of new token accounts observed was around 391,000.\n\nHowever, on 20th November, this figure rose to over 593,000, marking the highest count.\n\nAlso, the number of active wallets reached the second-highest point in the last three months, surpassing 438,000 as of the latest data.\n\nFurthermore, a review of Solana\u2019s uptime status revealed consistent stability over the past three months.\n\nRead Solana ( SOL) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe uptime extends the number of months without significant downtimes, reducing concerns previously associated with the network\u2019s performance.\n\nAs of this writing, Solana was experiencing a 5% increase in its value, trading at around $54.5."

Last week alone saw $13.6m inflows, outshining other altcoins as $SOL jumps 115% in 30 days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains dominant with $154.7m. Diversified crypto investments? Up by $7.9m.\u2026 \u2014 BlockVoyager (@BlockVoyagerAIO) November 21, 2023\n\nThis compares favorably to $3.3 million Ethereum received, with only Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 at $154.7 million \u2013 beating it.\n\nAs such, SOL is likely to continue rising healthily once the market regains a more positive outlook.\n\nAt the moment, Binance\u2019s settlement with the DoJ has dampened the mood, pulling SOL down along with most other tokens.\n\nYet the overall picture remains very positive for SOL, which has had an excellent 2023.\n\nTo some extent, its gains are a product of it making for a very poor 2022, during which it suffered a series of outages that damaged its reputation.\n\nsolana has flawlessly sustained 100% uptime for almost nine consecutive months what was once a 'joke' is now hardly a valid argument those hating on $sol will find themselves left behind as it continues to dominate in the bull market pic.twitter.com/qZg8Onm3m3 \u2014 buckets | sandbar.io \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f (@SOLbuckets) November 21, 2023\n\nYet it has now enjoyed 100% uptime for close to nine consecutive months, a sign of how much updates have improved its efficiency and resilience.\n\nBased on this, the Solana price is likely to reach $60 in the next couple of weeks and potentially end the year at around $80.\n\nOther Strong Altcoins\n\n\n\nSOL isn\u2019t the only promising alt in the market right now, with a number of newer coins \u2013 including presale tokens \u2013 looking like they could rally in the next few weeks.\n\nOne prime candidate to do this is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a stake-to-mine platform that has raised over $4.2 million in its ongoing presale.\n\nThis figure stands as a big vote of confidence in Bitcoin Minetrix, which will enable users to mine Bitcoin (BTC) by staking its native BTCMTX token.\n\nStaking BTCMTX provides users with mining credits, which they can spend on actual Bitcoin mining.\n\nDoing this enough will earn them freshly mined BTC, something which is likely to widen and democratize access to Bitcoin mining.\n\nIn addition, staking also earns users newly issued BTCMTX as well, meaning that Bitcoin Minetrix could end up being a highly lucrative platform for users.\n\n#BitcoinMinetrix imagines a renewed cloud mining landscape that merges ownership and cloud mining. Through transparency, independence, and safety, #BitcoinMinetrix aims to lead tokenized cloud mining, providing a reliable $BTC mining path for everyone. \ud83c\udf10\u2692\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/SOETy3de0a \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) November 21, 2023\n\nTo join the presale, investors need simply go to the official Bitcoin Minetrix website and connect their software wallets.\n\nThe sale is currently in its penultimate stage, with 1 BTCMTX costing $0.0118.\n\nThis will move $0.0119 by the sale\u2019s final stage, which begins in just under five days.\n\nAnd once the final stage is over, BTCMTX will list on exchanges, where it could potentially rally big.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Now\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.
