        "title": "Solana DeFi ecosystem rallies amid strong headwinds - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The Solana blockchain achieved a yearly high in the total value of assets locked (TVL) at $335 million on Oct. 2, as reported by DeFillama data.\n\nAs of the latest data available, the TVL has dipped slightly to $329.59 million. However, this increase underscores the recent influx of investors into the network\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nThis surge is a notable departure from the previous year\u2019s trend. In 2022, Solana\u2019s DeFi TVL experienced a gradual decline, influenced by the decreasing value of SOL and the broader market downturn. Concerns regarding the project\u2019s association with bankrupt FTX further exacerbated this decline.\n\nHowever, the network has enjoyed some growth this year and has seen its TVL climb from $210 million to the current levels. This represents an increase of close to 40% on the year-to-date metrics.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, despite this recent growth, Solana\u2019s DeFi TVL remains significantly below its all-time high, which exceeded $10 billion during the peak of the 2021 bull market. During that time, the Solana blockchain was widely touted as a potential \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nSolana still faces major headwinds.\n\nSolana\u2019s ecosystem is enjoying notable growth this year, scoring adoptions from Visa, Shopify, and other major traditional institutions. However, the blockchain network still faces major challenges.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token was one of the numerous digital assets the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) labeled as securities in its legal actions against major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThis classification led to the prompt removal of the asset by several trading platforms like Revolut, Bakkt, and others.\n\nBesides that, the network\u2019s token still faces significant selling pressure ahead as the Court has approved the bankrupt FTX move to sell its substantial digital asset holdings, which includes an over $1 billion position in SOL.\n\nThese issues have contributed significantly to the struggles SOL\u2019s price has faced this year. As of press time, SOL was trading for $23.06, up by more than 133% on the year-to-date metric, per CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nMentioned in this article"

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nSolana (SOL) has been making headlines recently with a 20% gain among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, currently trading at $23.09. But what's driving this impressive performance? Let's delve into the factors contributing to Solana's surge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the main attractions of Solana is its cost-effective access to decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum is notorious for having enormous gas fees at certain periods of time, scaring off some investors.\n\nWhile Solana's total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has seen an increase, the numbers are not as impressive as one might think. The TVL has only risen by about $7 million. In comparison, Ethereum's TVL is much higher, and even a modest growth on its part would easily outperform Solana's current TVL.\n\nThe market sentiment around Solana is generally positive, especially with the ongoing developments in its ecosystem. New projects and partnerships are continually being announced, adding to investor confidence.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Solana has managed to maintain a strong position. The asset has shown resilience in a somewhat volatile market, securing its 25% growth and maintaining above core technical thresholds.\n\nSolana has a robust roadmap with several upcoming upgrades and new features. These developments could further enhance its utility and, by extension, its price.\n\nWhile Solana is experiencing a surge, it is essential to consider the broader context. Its DeFi TVL is not as substantial as it could be, and Ethereum remains a strong competitor. However, Solana offers a cheaper and faster alternative for DeFi enthusiasts, which could be a significant factor in its current price rally. Investors should keep an eye on this asset but also remain cautious of the volatile nature of the crypto market."

        "title": "Crypto: SOL validators receive subsidies from Alameda! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Thu 05 Oct 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nControversy is brewing in the Solana ecosystem, fueled by allegations that the Solana Foundation and Alameda Research are heavily subsidizing the network\u2019s validators. The debate is crystallizing around the impact of these subsidies on the decentralization and sustainability of SOL, Solana\u2019s native crypto.\n\nMassive subsidies to SOL Validators raise questions about crypto-centralization\n\nSolana, a blockchain known for its speed and direct competition with Ethereum, finds itself at the heart of a debate linked to the substantial subsidy of its validators by the Solana Foundation and Alameda Research, the defunct commercial arm associated with FTX.\n\nAccording to analyst arixon.eth, over 90% of Solana\u2019s validators benefit from massive subsidies from the Solana Foundation and Alameda Research. At first glance, these figures are alarming: out of 1,997 validators, 1,818 are said to have received delegations from these two entities. In total, they delegated 106 million SOL, of which 73 million were distributed by the Foundation and 33 million by Alameda Research.\n\nValidators play an essential role in Solana\u2019s blockchain. They are responsible for validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. To ensure the network\u2019s security and decentralization, each node must store SOL, and this amount of SOL determines their voting power.\n\nThe scale of these subsidies raises questions about the centralization of power within the blockchain. Arixon.eth suggests that without these \u201cheavy incentives\u201d, the number of Solana validator nodes would be much lower.\n\nMore worryingly, a notable number of nodes seem to be left behind, without delegations from the standard SOL holders, raising the question of the disproportionate influence of two entities on the network.\n\nIn highlighting these considerable subsidies, arixon.eth warns of the risk of Solana\u2019s centralization under the hegemony of two predominant players. This, it argues, could potentially undermine the long-term value of SOLs and pose a critical dilemma for the decentralized robustness of the network.\n\nFunding for stability or manipulation?\n\nFaced with these allegations, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, stepped in to clarify the situation. According to him, although some 2,000 validators secure the network, it is their votes, and not their respective participation, that are essential to the network\u2019s security and stability.\n\nEvery time a node withdraws from SOL, its voting power diminishes, forcing the network to rely on other validators to maintain decentralization and security.\n\nThe question of centralization is a hot topic in the crypto world. While Solana benefits from substantial funding from two major entities, this raises legitimate questions about the network\u2019s true decentralization.\n\nHowever, one question remains: can the current model, criticized for its tendency towards centralization, ensure the network\u2019s long-term stability and security, or does the Solana blockchain need to revise its delegation strategy to preserve the integrity of its decentralized architecture?\n\nThe revelation of exorbitant subsidies to validators is prompting the crypto community to re-examine blockchain governance structures and business models, and to question the delicate balance between incentives and decentralization.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Key takeaways\n\nSolana (SOL) has become one of the most decentralized blockchain networks in addition to being one of the most scalable after reporting that its Nakamoto Coefficient score beats other leading chains\n\nA second validator client plus the addition of more nodes into the network have helped to improve the resilience of the blockchain following several major outages during its first 2 years\n\nCoinCodex price prediction algorithm expects SOL to surge in 2024\n\nSolana releases Validator Health Report for October showing major improvement to network decentralization\n\nSolana (SOL) has revealed that its Nakamoto Coefficient score now beats several leading blockchains in its Validator Health Report for October 2023. The report shows that Solana has experienced a steady improvement to the health and growth of its blockchain, with several major changes helping to improve the level of decentralization.\n\n1/ The most recent @Solana Validator Health Report is now published.\n\n\n\nSolana remains one of the largest proof-of-stake networks by node count, one of the most distributed by Nakamoto Coefficient, and now, one of the most resilient by validator clients.\n\n\n\n?https://t.co/84tag5MBCO pic.twitter.com/fRQl1Fb5t9 \u2014 Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) October 4, 2023\n\nThe Nakamoto Coefficient measures the least number of nodes required to successfully attack a blockchain. Since a blockchain is a distributed computer network that runs a consensus protocol in order to agree on the correct order of transactions, most blockchains can be successfully attacked if a single party gains control of the majority of nodes in the system.\n\nThe coefficient was designed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan to provide a measure for the level of decentralization, and by extension, the robustness of a given blockchain network. Solana\u2019s announcement that it is now more decentralized when compared against other leading chains follows a series of positive developments for the project.\n\nSolana\u2019s Nakamoto Coefficient score now beats Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Polygon (MATIC), to name a few. The project has shared a detailed breakdown for the health of the Solana network in its recent Validator Report, discussing a range of key developments that have helped the network to improve the health of the network.\n\nPreviously, Solana had been criticized for being less decentralized than its competitors \u2014 a problem that caused several network outages during its first 2 years on mainnet. A new validator client created by Jito Labs was cited as a key reason why this is unlikely to occur again, and there are two additional validator clients currently in development that can further improve network resilience.\n\nMost notably, the Solana network now contains more nodes than many major blockchains, in addition to these nodes being more widely distributed. This has given Solana a Nakamoto Coefficient score of 31, beating out Ethereum\u2019s 25 and Avalanche\u2019s 27 respectively. This news means that Solana is now one of the most decentralized blockchains in addition to being one of the most scalable.\n\nFollowing spree of positive developments, algorithm predicts +343% move for SOL in the next 12 months\n\nSOL has outperformed the rest of the crypto market during 2023, owing to a particularly poor performance in 2022. The SOL token suffered a -78% loss in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, as investors may have lost confidence in a project that was strongly backed by both FTX and Alameda Research.\n\nYear-to-date, SOL has risen 133%, outperforming the total crypto market cap (TCAP) which has risen 41% in the same time frame. The CoinCodex price prediction algorithm expects SOL to continue its recovery over the next 12 months, forecasting a +343.67% move by 4th October 2024.\n\n1-year price prediction for Solana, via CoinCodex\n\nBottom line: Solana continues to optimize its network, improving robustness and decentralization\n\nDecentralized computer systems rely on the trusted nature of the majority of participants, while also providing financial incentives to help ensure the efficacy of the consensus protocol. The more decentralized a network is, the more robust it becomes, and Solana\u2019s recent achievement of becoming one of the most decentralized proof-of-stake networks is another major success for the project."
