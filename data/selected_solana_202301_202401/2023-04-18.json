In the home\u2019s dining room, Solana had set up miniature wooden models of the works she\u2019d made for the occasion. In addition to the large panels and floating dwelling, her installation included a low-to-the-ground bridge \u2014 made to look like a row of columns receding into the distance on one side and a colorful city street on the other \u2014 and a set of standing screens where guests, including the architect India Mahdavi, the artistic director Barnaba Fornasetti and the artist Faye Toogood, posed for photos. The latter scene, arranged near the gates of the estate, also comprised two more small houses, these accented in pink and purple and light enough to be picked up. The creative director Ramdane Touhami was quick to lift one over his head."
