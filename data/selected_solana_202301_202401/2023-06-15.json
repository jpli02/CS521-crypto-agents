        "title": "Solana Beach teen picked as San Diego County Youth of the Year - Del Mar Times",
        "content": "Solana Beach teen Kyra Dominguez was picked as San Diego County Youth of the Year from nine finalists who stood out from all the teens attending the Boys & Girls Clubs in the San Diego area.\n\nKyra, 17, a junior at Torrey Pines High School, was recognized for her leadership, kindness, academic and athletic accomplishments and service to the community.\n\nThe Boys & Girls Clubs of San Dieguito nominates one exemplary teen member annually from each of its programs, including After School, Athletics, Aquatics, Youth Arts Academy and Bulldogs Basketball. Kyra was outstanding in the After School Program.\n\nAfter winning the title of 2022 Youth of the Year at the San Dieguito Boys & Girls Clubs for her exemplary character, leadership and community service, Kyra was nominated by a panel of judges to represent San Diego County at the statewide Boys & Girls Club competition in Sacramento in March.\n\n\u201cKyra is a very kind, sweet, self-driven, goal oriented, young individual. When I first got to know Kyra, I was amazed how mature and focused she was on all aspects of life. Kyra will always finish and reach any goal she sets her mind to. Kyra is a natural leader by example,\u201d said Bosque Leanio, manager of the Boys & Girls Clubs of San Dieguito\u2019s Harper Teen Center, in his nomination letter.\n\n\u201cMy staff and I always know we can count on Kyra to be there for her peers, for our organization and for her community wherever and whenever needed,\u201d Leanio said.\n\nAcademically, Kyra is a high achiever and plans to attend college to study to be a clinical psychologist. She credits her parents for encouraging her to get a good education.\n\n\u201cMy parents have instilled in me that the most important thing is my education. I am working hard every day to repay them for everything they have given me. I know the only way to accomplish this goal is through education,\u201d Kyra wrote in her nomination essay.\n\nAlong with pursuing her studies, Kyra competes on the Torrey Pines women\u2019s rugby team and loves to draw.\n\n\u201cEver since I can remember, I have always been drawing things I admired or blatantly for fun. That was my initial passion, to make art that could make people smile or bring a sense of comfort to them,\u201d Kyra said.\n\nKyra will pass the torch to the seven 2023 nominees for Youth of the Year at the Boys & Girls Clubs of San Dieguito\u2019s Youth of the Year Celebration in July. The event, held during the Greatest Show on Turf at the Del Mar Racetrack, includes entertainment, dinner, music and dancing along with auctions. Registration for the event is at bgcsandieguito.org."

        "title": "Alex Morgan talks World Cup, her new business venture and the future of women's soccer - Del Mar Times",
        "content": "When word got out he was opening a soccer store in Solana Beach, Brian Enge heard from a local soccer enthusiast who said she\u2019d liked to invest in the business.\n\nHer name? Alex Morgan.\n\nKind of like Taylor Swift calling up a local garage band and asking if they needed a singer.\n\nTalk about an easy decision for Enge, who on Wednesday afternoon saw the Alex Morgan effect up close when some 25 lottery-winning girls from five local soccer clubs lined up outside the Soccer Post store, eager to meet the Wave and U.S. national team star whose Instagram account numbers 10 million followers. In tow were a few local TV camera folks and newspaper reporters from San Diego and Los Angeles.\n\nIt didn\u2019t hurt Enge that his daughter Sierra is a rookie midfielder on the Wave, or that Morgan had a prior affiliation with the soccer-store chain.\n\nBut Morgan long ago was keen on inspiring girls, saying she aspires to build upon the opportunities her parents and many others created for her as she grew up in Diamond Bar east of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI just loving seeing the next generation come here today and just feel a little more inspired,\u201d said Morgan, whose San Diego foundation will get some of the store\u2019s proceeds during the upcoming World Cup.\n\nThe 33-year-old striker\u2019s nurturing skills extend as well to the youthful Wave, who are atop the National Women\u2019s Soccer League at the season\u2019s midway point and will face rival Angel City on Saturday at Snapdragon Stadium. And more so than ever, she\u2019ll want to fast-track U.S. teammates this summer \u2014 both before and during the World Cup that opens July 20 in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIf the Americans are to win a third consecutive World Cup, they\u2019ll probably need several first-time Cup participants to perform well and that will entail learning from Morgan. As you\u2019d expect, the veteran spoke highly of the young playmakers, having teamed up with many of them in U.S. exhibitions dating to July.\n\n\u201cYou look at Sophia Smith, Naomi Girma, Trinity Rodman, Ashley Sanchez \u2014 that\u2019s just to name a few,\u201d Morgan said of four NWSL players who are, in order, 22 years old, 23, 21 and 24. \u201cThese players have come in and dominated both at the club and the international level. That is an important piece to us performing well at the World Cup and us having a complete picture.\u201d\n\nElaborating as she often does when discussing women\u2019s soccer, Morgan hit on bigger realities and trends that ultimately shape the outcomes on the soccer field.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been trended as an older team because of the more opportunities in the U.S. to keep playing soccer in comparison to other countries,\u201d she said of the U.S. program. \u201cOther countries have leagues where women are able to compete past 25, 26, 27. They\u2019re making a good living. We need to make sure that we\u2019re looking at everything we can do to be the best. And these young players are going to play a huge part in that.\u201d\n\nAlex Morgan smiles during Wednesday\u2019s announcement. (Soccer Post)\n\nSo when asked why she believes that the competition in this summer\u2019s Cup, her third, will prove tougher than what she has experienced with the U.S. club, Morgan spoke of the economic growth of the women\u2019s game in other countries. She hit on the underlying forces. Economics. Opportunities for girls and women.\n\nMorgan praised the growth of leagues in Europe and also Mexico, though Mexico won\u2019t be one of the 32 countries participating this summer. She noted that in March, England\u2019s top women\u2019s league signed a broadcast rights deal with the BBC and Sky Sports. According to the Guardian newspaper, the payoff of about $10 million per year made it the biggest broadcasting deal for any women\u2019s soccer league.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different things I can point to, to say why this is the most competitive World Cup ever,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cFact of the matter is, female soccer players are being valued, embraced, appreciated in the way that we\u2019ve always fought for. So, I think it\u2019s just going to be a great showing.\u201d\n\nMorgan isn\u2019t the only soccer star with a long reach in the United States. According to Soccer Post\u2019s Blake Sonnek-Schmelz, the 40-store chain sold some 1,000 Lionel Messi jerseys on the recent day the Argentine star signed with Inter Miami of Major League Soccer. Price of the jersey: $90.\n\nIn San Diego, where the soccer ball keeps bouncing higher and higher, Messi could be an opponent come 2025, when an MLS expansion club is to open its first season in the same Mission Valley Stadium where the Wave play."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether, top 10 crypto in red, Fed warning of more rate hikes - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Thursday morning trading in Asia, dropping below US$25,000 at one stage for the first time since mid-March. Ether also retreated with other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies as trading volumes dipped and the U.S. Fed left interest rates unchanged as expected, but warned of more hikes this year to tackle inflation. Ripple\u2019s XRP token fell despite the release of documents this week that were expected to help the company\u2019s defense in an SEC lawsuit.\n\nCrypto in red\n\nBitcoin fell 2.94% over the last 24 hours to US$25,062.60 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 4.69% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about US$490 billion, dipped below the US$25,000 support line to as low as US$24,902 earlier in the morning.\n\nEther fell 4.74% to US$1,652.25, posting a 9.70% loss for the week. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nCardano dropped 4.10% to US$0.2624, losing 18.57% of its value in the past seven days. Solana fell 3.18% to US$14.44 and posted a weekly loss of 22.52%.\n\nThe two tokens have been on a downtrend since being named in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit filed last week against the Binance.US and Coinbase exchanges, where the federal agency categorized the two \u2014 along with many other altcoins \u2014 as financial securities.\n\nBenjamin Stani, the director of business development and sales at crypto trading platform Matrixport, said the declines are mostly the overhang from the SEC suing Binance and Coinbase.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been predominantly the altcoins that have been dropping,\u201d said Stani. \u201cBTC and, to some extent, ETH as well have been holding up better and that I think is mostly attributable to the fact that the SEC named a lot of [altcoins] as securities and that has this chilling effect.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as expected on Wednesday at 5% to 5.25% after ten consecutive hikes to curb inflation.\n\nBut in another negative for investors, Fed chair Jerome Powell said it may take years to get inflation under control, dousing expectations for rate cuts later this year and raising the likelihood of higher interest rates ahead. Stocks ended mixed.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the losers in the crypto top 10 by market capitalization, falling 7.48% to US$0.4793 on the day for a weekly loss of 7.19%.\n\nThe declines came despite the release of the so-called \u201cHinman documents,\u201d this week, a collection of previously sealed emails and pages from former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman. The notes indicate that Ether should not be categorized as a financial security.\n\nRipple Labs Inc. was sued by the SEC in December 2020 on allegations XRP was sold as an illegal unregistered security. Ripple wanted the Hinman documents made public, arguing they show the SEC itself was sending mixed and confused signals over whether cryptocurrencies were securities and failing to offer clear guidance to the industry, which is part of Ripple\u2019s fair notice defense in the case.\n\nHowever, XRP\u2019s price hasn\u2019t benefited from the release of the documents. Gabriel Shapiro, a U.S.-based attorney and the general counsel at blockchain firm Delphi Labs, wrote on Twitter Tuesday \u2014 \u201c\u200b\u200bHinman emails are a nothingburger though great for Ether. No idea why Ripple thinks these emails help Ripple\u2019s case.\u201d\n\nShapiro added that the documents were not the bombshell compared to the \u201chuge hype\u201d given to them.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap lost 2.76% to US$1.02 trillion in the last 24 hours, and the daily crypto trading volume fell 5.37% to US$31.89 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT on downtrend\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 0.86% to 2,912.74 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.64% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions rose 0.13% to US$23.7 million, while sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain by volume, fell 4.78% over the last 24 hours to US$13.52 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nThe Bitcoin network was the second largest NFT network in terms of transactions, rising 6.95% to US$4.1 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe recent buzz in the NFT community is around ERC-6551, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. ERC-6551 is the latest NFT standard for the Ethereum network that went into effect on May 7 this year.\n\n\u201cERC-6551 is introducing a standard for NFTs by unlocking their ability to be a smart wallet that can interact with different decentralized apps in the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cWith ERC-6551, when you transfer an NFT, the wallet and the tokens that the NFT holds also goes with it. Basically wallets within wallets.\u201d\n\nAbout 196 million of Blur tokens worth around US$62 million, 40% of the circulating supply, are being unlocked and distributed to investors and contributors on Wednesday, U.S. time. Blur is the native utility and governance tokens of the Blur NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201c[This] will almost definitely cause a crash in price, which will impact NFT prices,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cBasically, if the token is devalued, will people still want to farm for it via trading NFTs?\u201d\n\nTransactions of Uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 topped sales by collection, selling US$3.14 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum-based BoringPunks marked second with US$1.63 million in sales, with over 20,000 transactions in the past day.\n\nU.S. equity futures edge down\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after a mixed regular trading day on Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.09%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.06% lower and Nasdaq Futures lost 0.09%.\n\nThe U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% after its meeting on Wednesday. The rate is at its highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage last year.\n\nHowever, post-meeting comments from Powell hinted at two more rate hikes by the end of this year, while stating that rate cuts will not happen unless inflation is under control. That didn\u2019t go down well with some business leaders.\n\n\u201cThe battle against inflation is being won. This is now the time for the Fed to stop \u2013 not pause \u2013 interest rate hikes,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an email statement.\n\n\u201cThe time lag for monetary policies is notoriously long \u2014 it typically takes about 18 months to two years for the full effect of rate hikes to filter fully into the economy,\u201d Green said, adding that excessive rate hikes could lead to a recession in the U.S.\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for July 25 to 26.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 30.6% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at July\u2019s meeting, while 69.4% says the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points.\n\n(Updates with equities section)"
