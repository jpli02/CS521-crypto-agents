        "content": "Solana has introduced a limited-time offer for users seeking to transfer assets from their Metamask wallet, reducing the associated fees to 0%. This fee reduction is made possible through a collaboration between the layer 1 blockchain, DeBridgeFinance, and the Solana-based wallet \u2013 Solflare.\n\nAccording to the official announcement, whenever a MetaMask wallet is connected to a Solana app, users will also gain access to a trusted Solflare companion.\n\nThis Solflare widget boasts a range of features, including the ability to manage tokens and NFTs, swap tokens, stake SOL, and monitor activity comprehensively.\n\nEnsuring security with balance change previews and future-spend approval warnings are some of the other features incorporated within the widget, the platform said in a tweet.\n\nThe latest development comes a little over a month after Solana\u2019s Solflare wallet announced its debut on MetaMask Snaps, a feature introduced by Consensys engineers that offers enhanced customization options for the MetaMask wallet, which was primarily an EVM-based platform.\n\nUntil recently, compatibility issues between Solana and MetaMask had forced users to establish separate wallets for managing SOL and NFTs associated with the Solana network.\n\nHowever, the integration enables the seamless management of SOL and Solana-based NFTs directly within MetaMask wallets. Additionally, Solana decentralized applications (dApps) are now readily accessible through the popular Web3 wallet service provider.\n\nSolflare stands alongside 33 other third-party developers who have designed Snaps, providing users with the ability to tailor their notifications, access transaction insights before they finalize them, and customize their user interface."

        "content": "A popular crypto trader is predicting that Solana (SOL) and another altcoin will be top performers in the next bull cycle for one key reason.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 224,800 followers on the social media platform X that the recent rallies by SOL and Chainlink (LINK) indicate the two alts will outperform other cryptos based on history.\n\n\u201cSo it seems of all the \u2018majors,\u2019 SOL and LINK are the two standout outperformers right now that I can see.\n\nIn my experience, the first runners usually continue to outperform all through the bull market.\n\nNaturally, people feel they missed the boat and want to chase other coins instead in hopes they are lagging. I\u2019ve also done this myself from time to time, but it\u2019s worth remembering that there usually isn\u2019t \u2018the next LINK\u2019 or \u2018the next SOL.\u2019\n\nThe next LINK and SOL are going to keep being LINK and SOL IMO (in my opinion).\u201d\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (BTC) and predicts ETH/BTC may be at the start of an uptrend based on several indicators, including an engulfing candle.\n\nTraders watch for a bullish engulfing candle since it may suggest an asset\u2019s downtrend is about to undergo a reversal.\n\n\u201cNot only did ETH manage to close the weekly as an engulfing [candle], but also a confirmed weekly bull divergence.\n\nCouple that with the first test of the weekly 200 MA (moving average) on ETH/BTC and I think it\u2019s setting up for quite a nice move up. A very welcome change after months of chop which feels like it might finally have come to an end.\u201d\n\nA bullish ETH/BTC chart suggests that Ethereum will likely outperform Bitcoin.\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.0511 BTC ($1,753) at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The legwork behind DeFi hacks can be quite sophisticated. But an attacker targeting Synthetify last week only had to vote on \u2014 and pass \u2014 their own proposal to steal some $230,000 worth of crypto.\n\nSynthetify was exploited by an attacker who made and voted for public proposals in the protocol\u2019s decentralized autonomous organization. By the time other DAO members noticed something was amiss, the funds had already been sent to Tornado Cash.\n\nThe situation represents a fresh example of a governance failure resulting in lost funds.\n\nSynthetify is a Solana-native DEX that fell into debt following FTX\u2019s meltdown late last year. In April, the project announced that it has plans to restructure.\n\nTaking advantage of the DAO\u2019s inactivity, the exploiter created ten identical-looking proposals and used their own tokens to reach the voting quorum. Nine of the proposals were empty, but the tenth contained code that sent around $230,000 in USDC, mSOL and stSOL to the attacker\u2019s address, according to an X thread from the security auditing firm Neodyme.\n\n$89,669 remains in the DAO\u2019s treasury, according to available data.\n\nThe attacker\u2019s exploit \u2014 conducted through the token vote-centric governance process, highlights the potential pitfalls facing DAOs that seek to ward off bad actors.\n\nIn the past, attackers have exploited DAO treasuries with so-called flash loans, borrowing large amounts of governance tokens to pass malicious proposals.\n\nSerhii Kravchenko, chief operating officer of the DAO infrastructure provider DeXe DAO Studio, said DAOs should build better notification systems for the proposal process and should invest more heavily in financial incentives that reward DAO members for their participation.\n\nRead more: DeFi security firm Quantstamp pilots hack protection program\n\nSolana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko wrote on X that DAOs should have veto councils that can prevent attacks caused by token voting.\n\n\u201cAny DAO with pure token voting is just waiting to be attacked,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAsked whether a veto council would have prevented Synthetify from being exploited \u2014 given that the attacking proposal went unnoticed until it had already passed through the governance process \u2014 Yakovenko echoed Kravchenko.\n\n\u201cPay the council to pay attention!\u201d Yakovenko wrote.\n\nUpdated Oct. 24, 2023 at 4:08 pm: Clarified for additional context.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Is Solana Dead? A Look at the Data - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "SOL\n\nDespite setbacks, such as the FTX collapse and network performance issues, Solana has demonstrated remarkable endurance, as evidenced by its NFT market resilience, developer activity, and DeFi growth.\n\nSummary:\n\nSolana's groundbreaking features include high throughput, low fees, and scalability, setting it apart in the blockchain realm.\n\nChallenges such as the FTX collapse and network outages shook Solana, impacting its price and active wallets.\n\nDespite setbacks, Solana's NFT market resilience, developer activity, and DeFi growth indicate its survival in the crypto landscape.\n\nNotable milestones, partnerships with major players, and enhanced reliability demonstrate Solana's enduring potential and resilience.\n\nExploring Solana's Ascent\n\nIn 2020, Solana burst onto the blockchain scene with a bold vision\u2014to provide a platform capable of processing over 65,000 transactions per second while upholding the utmost security standards. Its ambitious aim was to address the long-standing scalability issues that had hindered many other blockchain networks. The launch of Solana's Mainnet Beta in March 2020 marked the beginning of its journey as an operational blockchain network. Let's delve into the fundamental features that set Solana apart in the world of blockchain.\n\n1. High Throughput: Solana's exceptional throughput, attributed to its innovative consensus mechanism and Proof of Stake (PoS) system, positions it to manage a staggering number of transactions. This feature makes Solana well-suited for applications ranging from high-frequency trading to decentralized gaming.\n\n2. Low Fees: Unlike many blockchain networks plagued by unpredictable and soaring transaction fees during periods of congestion, Solana offers consistently low fees.\n\n3. Scalability: From its foundational design, Solana emphasizes scalability. It employs unique approaches such as sharding, which divides the network into smaller subnets that process transactions in parallel. This design ensures that block propagation and confirmation times remain steady as the network expands, accommodating a growing user base without compromising performance.\n\n4. Smart Contracts: Solana empowers developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) through smart contracts, opening the door to a wide array of possibilities. These self-executing contracts drive innovation in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.\n\nWhile Solana enjoyed rapid growth and success, it encountered a series of challenges starting with the Luna market incident, which sent shockwaves throughout the crypto market. This tumultuous period had an impact on Solana's price, network activity, and active wallets. However, it was not the end of struggles for Solana in the same year.\n\nSource: Solana Twitter\n\n\u200d\n\nEffect of FTX Collapse on Solana\n\nFTX's Financial Turmoil Shakes Solana's Foundation\n\nThe stunning collapse of FTX, once viewed as an impregnable giant in the crypto space, sent shockwaves through the Solana community. The exchange's mismanagement and subsequent bankruptcy filing not only stirred panic among investors but also raised concerns about the fate of Solana's assets held within the troubled platform.\n\nSolana's Vulnerability Exposed\n\nWith FTX's mounting financial woes, Solana's reputation was pulled into the chaos. Sam Bankman-Fried's vocal advocacy of Solana now seemed to work against the blockchain, as the bankrupt FTX held a significant amount of SOL, creating uncertainty leading to a sell-off.\n\nWhile the Solana Foundation confirmed relatively minimal exposure to FTX's crisis, a report hinted at Alameda Research's considerable holdings of SOL tokens, causing concerns about potential liquidations and their impact on Solana's already turbulent market value.\n\nSolana's Price Plunge Amidst Macroeconomic Headwinds\n\nThe broader macroeconomic conditions took a toll on the entire cryptocurrency space, and Solana was no exception. Escalating inflation and an impending rate hike by the Federal Reserve shattered the notion that cryptocurrencies would act as a reliable hedge against economic volatility.\n\nOther factors adding to the pain of Solana\n\nPerennial Network Outages and Performance Issues\n\nSolana's persistent struggle with network outages and performance glitches has significantly impacted user confidence. Despite attempts to rectify these issues through updates and optimizations, the recurring downtimes have raised concerns about the platform's reliability, potentially deterring users and projects from committing to Solana for critical operations.\n\nRising Competition from Established Blockchain Platforms\n\nSolana faces stiff competition from well-established blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, and Avalanche. Solana hasn\u2019t done well attracting users and projects by showcasing its unique value propositions.\n\nVigilance Against Security Breaches\n\nThe specter of potential security breaches looms over the Solana ecosystem, posing a significant threat to user funds and the overall credibility of the network. The susceptibility of dApps built on the Solana blockchain to security vulnerabilities remains a critical concern, necessitating robust security measures to protect users and maintain trust within the Solana community.\n\nFollowing the collapse of FTX and other factors, prominent Solana-based DeFi projects Serum and Oxygen ceased operations. Moreover, last December, popular NFT projects, DeGods and Y00ts migrated to Ethereum and Polygon, respectively, due to Solana's diminishing activity.\n\nSince then, Solana's number of active wallets has declined.\n\nSolana active wallets all-time chart (Source: Solscan)\n\nMoreover, the total locked volume fell from $945 million on Nov. 4 to $210 million on January 1.\n\nTotal volume locked (TVL) (Source: Artemis)\n\nThe price of Solana also dipped below $10 to $9.65 last December, a 96% fall from its all-time high.\n\nDoes this mean Solana is dead?\n\nIs Solana Dead?\n\nTo answer the questions, let\u2019s look at some of the metrics on the Solana network.\n\nSolana NFT Market\n\nDespite the broader NFT market's downturn, Solana's NFT ecosystem has displayed signs of resilience, with recent stabilization and notable growth observed in key metrics. The Solana NFT Floor Value and Trading Volume, although affected in Q3, 2023, have shown signs of recovery over the last two weeks, pointing to a potential upward trajectory in the coming months.\n\nSolana NFT Index 90-day Chart (Source: Solana Floor)\n\nNoteworthy projects within the Solana NFT market, such as Idle Gaming, The Heist, and Reavers, have demonstrated substantial growth, highlighting the continued vibrancy of the Solana NFT landscape.\n\nCore Developer Activity and On-Chain Transactions\n\nWhile Solana experienced a significant drop in developer activity in the past year, recent data suggests a stabilization in this domain. The network's daily transactions, although trailing behind competitors like Ethereum and Polygon, have shown stability over the last few months.\n\nSolana core developer activity over the past 365 days (Source: Token Terminal)\n\nDespite minor fluctuations, Solana has seen stable daily completed transactions over the last three months, signaling sustained user engagement and network activity.\n\nSolana 3-month daily transactions chart (Source: Artemis)\n\nDeFi Growth and Value Capture\n\nSolana's DeFi sector has witnessed substantial growth, as evidenced by the notable increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) and the rising prominence of top dApps like Sharky, Parrot, and Saber Labs. As of writing, the TVL stands at $1.269 billion, a growth from $421 million on Dec.31, 2022.\n\nSolana TVL (Source: DeFiLlama)\n\nThe platform's upward trajectory was supported by increased fees and overall blockchain revenue.\n\nSAGE Labs Surpasses Expectations\n\nSAGE Labs, the innovative browser-based sci-fi game on Solana's network, achieved remarkable milestones recently, outshining even established networks like Polygon. With over 2.29 million transactions recorded in a single day on Oct. 9, SAGE Labs surpassed Polygon's total transaction count by approximately 256,000.\n\nSolana's immersive 2D space management simulation game, featuring interactive elements tied to the Solana blockchain, has captivated the crypto gaming community, enhancing its gaming credibility.\n\nUptime and Reliability Progress\n\nThe year 2023 has marked an improvement in Solana's reliability and uptime, with only one outage reported, as per the Solana Foundation's report. The network has historically struggled with these issues, with co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko referring to them as a \"curse\" in previous years. Notably, the network's low-cost transactions were identified as a primary cause of these outages, according to a report.\n\nSolana's Lucrative Partnerships Foster Growth\n\nSolana's strategic collaborations with major players like Visa, Shopify, and Google Cloud underscore the platform's growing influence and market relevance. The extension of Visa's stablecoin settlement pilot program to include Solana represents a significant vote of confidence in the network's capabilities, dispelling concerns associated with past downtime issues. Additionally, the integration of Solana Pay with Shopify empowers businesses with enhanced payment solutions, illustrating Solana's commitment to fostering a robust blockchain ecosystem. Google Cloud's efforts to incentivize Web3 startups through grants further reinforce Solana's status as a leading platform for innovative projects.\n\nLooking at the metrics we can clearly say Solana isn\u2019t dead yet. While it has been battered, it has also shown resilience and has been through one of the worst crypto winters.\n\nOver the past 10 months, Solana ($SOL) has grown rapidly. On Oct. 24, it reached $31.7, an increase of 325% from $9.65 on Dec. 30.\n\nSolana 1-month price chart (Source: CoinMarketCap)\n\n\u200d\n\nSolana's Resilience and Growth Potential\n\nDespite recent challenges, Solana's underlying strengths remain robust, making it a key player in the blockchain ecosystem. Its capacity to efficiently host DApps and support NFTs and DeFi protocols illustrates its relevance and potential in the ever-expanding crypto landscape.\n\nWhile Solana has grappled with system downtimes and project migrations, it has an opportunity to address these issues comprehensively.\n\nBy enhancing its infrastructure and bolstering its solutions, Solana can rebuild trust and solidify its position in the market.\n\nConcerns about Solana's sustainability reflect the overall volatility of the cryptocurrency market in its ever-fluctuating world. While challenges persist, Solana's commitment to its vision and innovative approach positions it as a formidable contender in the layer-2 race, ready to embrace the opportunities."
