        "content": "The Solana NFT ecosystem has seen some bumpy rides in the recent time, since the FTX downfall last year, and one of the major reasons was the token pricing where SOL went to a single-digit price before slowly picking itself up to more than double the bottom that it reached. The big positive for the NFT ecosystem was that the holders and Solana community stayed together to see the market hold as it is, even if the prices of NFTs tanked for a while.\n\nWhile all seem a bit settled, Frank, co-founder of DeGods announced that the top collections on Solana, i.e. DeGods and Y00ts would move out of Solana, to Ethereum and Polygon chains respectively. There began the division of the community, with some leaving the Solana space with these two collections, while some chose to stick around and help continue running the space and vibing with the rest of the communities. In 2023, we\u2019ve seen very few good new collections launching on Solana, but with DeGods and Y00ts bridging to other chains, are there any that would replace them to be the leaders and the blue chips of the SOL NFT ecosystem?\n\nHere are the Sol NFT projects that I feel would be taking ahead the NFT ecosystem and defining themselves as the blue chips of Solana.\n\nMad Lads\n\nClaynosaurz\n\nFamous Fox Federation\n\nAssetDash Vanta\n\nDegenerate Ape Academy\n\nSolana Monkey Business\n\noogy\n\nOkay Bears\n\nLILY\n\nSmyths\n\nThe reasoning for each is different, but with how things have been with regard to the community they are building and how people have been bullish on each of them.\n\nClaynosaurz has been building around IP creation and excellent content, and it has one of the best animated NFT collections on any chain. Check out the thread I had done to tell why I am bullish on Claynosaurz and the brand \u2013 Read here.\n\nMad Lads is a collection from Backpack, and ever since the mint, this collection has been called the next DeGods. Mad Lads had minted at 6.9 SOL and for a large collection of 10000, there\u2019s a reason why the floor climbed to over 80 SOL in a matter of few days. Backpack is a Solana wallet that is available for the web as an extension, with mobile wallets coming soon for both Android and iOS. This is more a brand than just a regular NFT project offering utilities.\n\noogy is a community-driven art collection of 10000 NFTs, and they have been building a strong community since the mint. While there are a few things down the roadmap, the art is what will keep it community-front going forward, and oogy does have a good number of influencers who are known well in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nAssetDash is a portfolio tracker app that is available for both, Android devices and iPhones. They recently minted a collection AssetDash Vanta at 5.5 SOL each, which got minted out within minutes for the size of 10000 NFTs, and the floor price went to double the mint price within a couple of days after the mint.\n\nSmyths was earlier called Blocksmith Labs, and they had amazing tools for the Solana ecosystem, where newer minting collections were handling whitelisting of users, and more. Smyths has seen some competition from Subber in recent times, but the new Atlas tool from Smyths has been proving quite good and the holders of Smyths get whitelists pretty easily.\n\nSome of the older collections from my list are Solana Monkey Business, Okay Bears, Degenerate Ape Academy, and Famous Fox Federation. These OG collections should have easily captured the top spots, but they didn\u2019t for many reasons. This shouldn\u2019t make you go against them as they still are good builders and Smyths, and FFF have been developing tools for Solana and for the entire NFT ecosystem.\n\nWhat do you feel are the best SOL collections you are bullish on? Comment and share your thoughts."

        "title": "Magic Eden Review: What To Know About The Pros, Cons, & Features - Milk Road",
        "content": "Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are sweeping the globe, and the demand for unique digital assets is skyrocketing. In 2021, crypto enthusiasts spent nearly $41 billion in the NFT marketplace, which was only $9 billion less than what was spent on traditional art that year.\n\nEvery day, roughly 3,200 NFTs are sold \u2014 and over half of them are priced at under $200. Many of these NFTs are bought or sold on Magic Eden, a decentralized platform that allows users to buy, sell, and trade NFTs. Initially, Magic Eden was limited to the Solano blockchain but recently went multi-chain by integrating Ethereum-based NFTs into the mix.\n\nThat said, Magic Eden is the current leader in Solana-based NFTs, hosting more than 90% of the ecosystem\u2019s trades on its platform. Now that the Ethereum integration is complete, Magic Eden offers the same type of market benefits for Ethereum-based NFTs as it does with Solana-based NFTs, including marketing support, minting tool kit, and white-listing tools. That makes it an even more attractive option for NFT users, but is it the right platform for you? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nMagic Eden NFT platform\n\nMagic Eden Pros And Cons\n\nMagic Eden Pros\n\nThere are a few different perks to using Magic Eden, including:\n\nPlatform Is Easy To Use For Purchasing And Creating\n\nThe Magic Eden platform is both intuitive and extremely easy to navigate, whether you\u2019re looking to purchase NFTs or want to create and launch your own NFT collection. The platform also offers the Launchpad feature to users, which is a revolutionary way to create and sell your own NFTs.\n\nWide Selection Of High-Quality NFTs\n\nIf there is a website with some of the most popular and sought-after NFTs on the market, it\u2019s Magic Eden. The \u2018Popular Collections\u201d feature lets you know which collections are getting the most attention at the moment. This feature can come in handy if you\u2019re an investor who\u2019s looking to make a quick profit. Plus, the Launchpad feature claims to ensure that only the best NFT collections are added to the ecosystem on the marketplace, which may help to cut down on some of the clutter that can overwhelm other NFT marketplaces.\n\nLow Transaction Fees\n\nAny NFT marketplace you use will charge a transaction fee for what you\u2019re buying or selling. However, Magic Eden offers a flat 2% transaction fee, which is one of the lowest on the market. That makes the platform more affordable compared to some of its competitors. It also honors the royalties set by creators, which isn\u2019t always the case on other platforms.\n\nMagic Eden Cons\n\nWhile Magic Eden has a lot of great features, it also has some potential downsides that users should be aware of before diving in.\n\nMobile App Is For Browsing Only\n\nWhile Magic Eden has a mobile app, you can\u2019t create or purchase NFTs on it. That lack of functionality can be frustrating. There\u2019s also no wallet integration available on the app, so personal collections can not be viewed on it.\n\nLeans Toward The Cheaper End Of NFTs\n\nThere are NFT projects on Magic Eden that appear to be copies of popular collections, which is problematic but not surprising. It is, after all, an open platform without much moderation, so anyone can create and potentially copy content.\n\nClosed Source Software\n\nThe platform uses closed source software that can\u2019t be audited by the community. This lack of transparency adds to the potential risks for NFT traders.\n\nWho Magic Eden Is Best For\n\nMagic Eden is worth considering for both collectors and creators of NFTs, as the platform was created to benefit both.\n\nCreators: Digital asset creators will likely benefit from the ease of use related to Magic Eden\u2019s Launchpad. Creating NFTs on Launchpad is a straightforward process that makes minting NFTs safe and secure.\n\nDigital asset creators will likely benefit from the ease of use related to Magic Eden\u2019s Launchpad. Creating NFTs on Launchpad is a straightforward process that makes minting NFTs safe and secure. Collectors: Magic Eden is worth a look for collectors who are looking for the hottest collections or the projects creating buzz. Plus, Magic Eden also has a buy-it-now feature, so you can grab what you want without having to bid for it in an auction.\n\nKey Features Of Magic Eden\n\nThe Magic Eden platform does everything possible to make purchasing and minting NFTs a simple process. Features like Launchpad, along with low fees and a supportive community that allows for user input all help to move the platform forward.\n\nNo Fees For Listing Or Offers: There is no fee for listing NFTs and for making offers; the fees you pay are transaction fees when a sale is made.\n\nThere is no fee for listing NFTs and for making offers; the fees you pay are transaction fees when a sale is made.

Community Mindset: Magic Eden takes into account the feedback and suggestions it receives from users, which means it\u2019s constantly working to improve the platform\n\nWhat Blockchains Does The Magic Eden Platform Support?\n\nMagic Eden was initially built on the Solana blockchain and was, until recently, a one-chain marketplace. However, Magic Eden recently expanded and went multi-chain, so it now also supports the Ethereum blockchain as well. That gives NFT shoppers a couple of different options when using this marketplace.\n\nAnd, Ethereum blockchain users won\u2019t have to give up any of the features or benefits offered by Magic Eden. The benefits when using the Ethereum blockchain are no different than using the Solana blockchain, which means that all users on either blockchain will have access to the minting tools, whitelisting tools, and other types of support.\n\nCan Fiat Currency Be Used To Purchase NFTs On Magic Eden?\n\nThe Magic Eden marketplace allows you to purchase NFTs in a few different ways. In addition to using your SOL or ETH tokens to purchase NFTs, you can use fiat currency to purchase NFTs on Magic Eden by paying with a debit or credit card through a third-party app called Moonpay. The Moonpay option still requires you to convert your fiat to SOL or ETH to complete your purchase, but it\u2019s a more streamlined way to use fiat currency to purchase NFTs on this platform.\n\nFees For Using Magic Eden\n\nLike any NFT platform, there are fees associated with using Magic Eden, including:\n\nMagic Eden Fees\n\nListing Fee Transaction Fee Royalty Fee Offer Fee No fee 2% Determined by NFT creator No fee\n\nAlternatives To Consider\n\nDifferent platforms offer different perks, rates, and payment options. If Magic Eden isn\u2019t the right NFT marketplace for you, here are some alternatives to consider.\n\nOpenSea: Good For Users Looking For An Established Platform\n\nOpenSea is the biggest name in the NFT world. It is the most recognized platform and is considered the king of the NFT platforms. OpenSea has all sorts of digital assets and supports over 150 different payment tokens.\n\nSuperRare: Good Marketplace For Digital Creators\n\nSuperRare offers an excellent platform for digital creators and collectors who are looking to buy or sell NFTs. The platform was built to feature unique, single-edition digital artwork, and it caters to both creators and buyers by enabling artists to create and tokenize their art.\n\nRarible: Good For Beginner NFT Enthusiasts\n\nRarible stands out because its goal is to simplify the process of buying, selling, and creating NFTs, which makes it a smart option for new NFT enthusiasts. The platform is optimized for beginners and offers highly popular collections and single items, and buying or selling NFTs on Rarible doesn\u2019t require any coding knowledge.\n\nIs Magic Eden Right For You?\n\nMagic Eden is an option worth considering for NFT designers and collectors. The process of creating and minting NFTs on Launchpad is straightforward and user-friendly, and it features automatic distribution. All you have to do is upload your file and you\u2019re good to go. Launchpad takes care of the rest.\n\nIf you\u2019re a collector, this platform makes it simple to see what\u2019s trending and purchase either single NFTs or entire collections. Plus, the buy it now option makes the transaction process more streamlined, as there are no other buyers to compete with in a bidding war.\n\nFinal Thoughts On Magic Eden\n\nMagic Eden is a standout in the NFT marketplace thanks to its Launchpad feature, which makes it simple for artists to create and mint NFTs on the platform. That, coupled with other benefits, like low trading fees and royalty fees for NFTs determined by the creators, and the platform is a solid option to consider if you\u2019re looking for an NFT marketplace. Plus, the NFT collections listed on Magic Eden are growing, which means there\u2019s more trading happening on the platform. Whether the goal is to mint your own NFTs or purchase them for your own personal collection, Magic Eden is a great place to get the ball rolling.\n\nMethodology\n\nMilkRoad.com reviews cryptocurrency and Web3 products, services, and companies based on five quantifiable metrics to help crypto users understand how they compare based on similar metrics.
