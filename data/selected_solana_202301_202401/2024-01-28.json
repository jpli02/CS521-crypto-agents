        "content": "Solana-based DEX Jupiter Flips Uniswap in Trading Volume\n\nSolana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter has surpassed the combined trading volume of Uniswap V2 and V3 protocols, reaching $480 million in the last 24 hours. This surge in activity is attributed to the hype surrounding a new memecoin airdrop by Jupiter and heightened stablecoin swaps. Jupiter's trading volume surpassed that of the dominant Ethereum-based Uniswap, which saw a combined volume of $470 million during the same period.\n\nAt the heart of this trading frenzy is the \"Wen\" memecoin, which was airdropped to any Solana user who had interacted with Jupiter in the past six months, as well as owners of Solana's Saga phone. The memecoin was designed as an experiment by Jupiter developers ahead of the eagerly anticipated airdrop of the exchange's native token, JUP, scheduled for January 31.\n\nWhile the Wen memecoin contributed approximately $50 million to Jupiter's daily trading volume, the bulk of the activity stemmed from the trading of Solana (SOL) into Circle's USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT), accounting for $191 million of the total volume.\n\nJupiter's success in attracting trading volume highlights the growing popularity of Solana as a blockchain platform and the increasing adoption of decentralized exchanges. The upcoming JUP airdrop has further fueled interest in the platform, attracting both retail and institutional investors.\n\nThe market excitement surrounding the JUP airdrop is part of a broader trend of airdrop announcements across the crypto ecosystem. Recently, Ethereum scaling solution AltLayer announced a $100 million airdrop to its users, while Layer-2 Manta Network also airdropped its MANTA token to eligible community members."

        "content": "Although Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) currently sits 67% below its all-time high, which was set in November 2021, this cryptocurrency has still skyrocketed 2,700% in the last three years. That gain crushes the rise of the Nasdaq Composite Index.\n\nThe impressive price performance highlights how successful it's been to speculate on this digital token in the past, despite its volatility. Bullish supporters are hoping for this to continue in the years ahead.\n\nHowever, price changes might mask the fact that Solana has potential in the payments market, a lucrative area of the financial services sector. Could this innovative crypto possibly even be the PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) of the future? Let's take a closer look.\n\nSolana Pay\n\nAbout two years ago, Solana Pay was introduced. Launched by Solana Labs, the governing body of this network, Solana Pay allows merchants and consumers to transact directly with one another without the need for an intermediary. There's instant settlement and near-zero fees because transactions are completed on the blockchain.\n\nThe reason Solana is set up to be a potential disruptor in the payments industry is because of its incredibly fast throughput, with a theoretical capacity to process 50,000 transactions per second (TPS). For comparison's sake, Visa's payments network can able to handle about 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nSolana Pay would allow for deeper connections among all parties in the transaction. Instead of a receipt, a customer could receive a non-fungible token (NFT) with embedded features for future use.\n\nFor example, a record shop could give its customers an NFT that notifies them when there's a sale going on or a live band performing. The NFT could be their ticket to the event. Adding customer-loyalty programs is also possible.\n\nSolana Pay had a major win when it was integrated with Shopify. This lets the e-commerce platform's merchants integrate with this innovative payments service.\n\nIt's not hard to figure out why Solana wants to be successful in payments. PayPal is set to generate $4.6 billion of free cash flow this year. And both Visa and Mastercard are some of the most profitable enterprises in the world. This means there's financial upside should Solana Pay gain greater adoption.\n\nNot so fast\n\nBut it's a long way from reaching PayPal. As of Sept. 30, PayPal had 428 million active accounts, a figure that includes 35 million merchants. And the company handled annualized total payment volume of $1.6 trillion in the third quarter last year, indicative of its vast scale. PayPal services are also offered in more than 200 countries.\n\nStory continues\n\nFounded more than two decades ago, PayPal has a first-mover advantage in the online payment market, allowing the business to develop a core competency in facilitating commerce. This has made the PayPal name a trusted brand.\n\nWith Solana, there are always technical and security risks. Its network has had outages in the past. And when it comes to consumers and their crypto holdings, there's always a possibility of hacks wiping them out.\n\nSo despite it's extremely low fees and instant settlement times, Solana Pay has to be compelling enough for both merchants and consumers to want to switch from their current payment methods, which already work seamlessly. I don't see this happening anytime soon.\n\nFor what it's worth, though, Solana Pay is something to pay close attention to in the years ahead. It just might be this crypto's killer use case.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Solana wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 22, 2024\n\nNeil Patel and his clients have no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Mastercard, PayPal, Shopify, Solana, and Visa.
