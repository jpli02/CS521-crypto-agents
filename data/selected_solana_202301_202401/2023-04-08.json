        "title": "Solana presents breakthrough with new NFT feature \u2013 Can it drive SOL price to $25? Report - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Solana attempts to make a comeback, with the introduction of a new promising technology dubbed \u201cState compression.\u201d\n\nThe technology promises to significantly reduce the cost of minting NFTs on the Solana network.\n\nSolana makes up a fair share of the conversations in the crypto community. However, these conversations have mostly been centered around the network\u2019s inconsistency and recurring breakdown. On what looks like a mission to redeem itself, the network has announced a groundbreaking NFT feature poised to shake the entire NFT and Web3 market at large.\n\nIn a recent announcement curated by Jon Wong, the technical lead on the ecosystem engineering team at the Solana Foundation, Wong details the needs that Solana\u2019s latest NFT feature promises to meet.\n\nThe \u201cState Compression\u201d technology as it is called, is designed to reduce the cost of minting NFTs.\n\nThe technology makes use of a data system known as Merkle trees. Merkle trees allow for verifiable off-chain storage on the Solana network. This then leads to the reduction of on-chain storage costs.A segment of the announcement read:\n\nWhen it comes to building web3 experiences at scale, Solana has been the industry leader thanks to its unparalleled speed, minimal environmental impact, composability, and low gas fees. But now, it\u2019s about to cost even less to build user-first web3 projects. Introducing state compression, a new way to store data directly on-chain that cuts down on cost by magnitudes of scale.\n\nState Compression already being used by leading NFT firms\n\nApparently, State Compression is already in use. According to the announcement, teams across the Solana network have already begun utilizing state compression to power massive user-friendly experiences.\n\nCrossmint, an NFT firm using a modular suite of APIs and tools to create, distribute, and custody NFTs at scale. The firm is utilizing state compression to build integrations. These integrations help companies across the globe to power deeper customer loyalty.\n\nSimilarly, Dialect, a smart messaging protocol that powers seamless, on-chain messaging experiences, is using state compression. The firm uses state compression to cover the cost of minting NFT stickers for its large user base.\n\nNotably, Helium, a blockchain-based network that connects IoT devices, NFT distributor DRiP, and Wordcel, an onchain-publisher, all use state compression to push their scalable, user-first experiences to the Solana network. The State Compression technology also has other use cases, outside on-chain data storage, the first being compressed NFTs. The announcement added:\n\nAlthough state compression can be used to store any sort of data on-chain, the first use of this innovative technology is compressed NFTs. Compressed NFTs are just like regular NFTs, only drastically cheaper \u2014 minting 100 million compressed NFTs costs about \u25ce50 to store on-chain, compared to \u25ce1.2mm for their uncompressed counterpart.\n\nAdditionally, due to the fact that every incremental compressed NFT is in fact a modification of a tree that already exists, the cost of an NFT on the Solana network has dropped to as low as\u25ce0.000005, for a single transaction.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "nb The following content is a paid release. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the content provider and does not reflect the views or opinions of CryptoMode.\n\nThe crypto glut of last year has followed certain cryptocurrencies into the new year. While popular cryptos like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are experiencing depletion in market cap and price value, the pessimism that these tokens will continue on the bearish spiral has turned enthusiastic traders into less volatile tokens with potential.\n\nInvestors have piled on interest in innovative tokens like DigiToads (TOADS) that provide users with enticing and profitable advantages on the crypto market. DigiToads (TOADS) has recently seen record-breaking numbers on their presale, topping the list of the top ten cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023.\n\nThis article updates the current price performance of Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) as DigiToads (TOADS) enjoys a record-breaking first presale.\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) Presale Holds Strong Position\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) \u2018s distinctiveness lies in its offers and benefits. It boasts multiple utilities and full use cases as a DeFi token while enticing players with its interactive Play-to-Earn vertical interface and providing income for investors through NFT staking. The platform is feature-rich, and although it\u2019s a new token, it juggles the reality of crypto trading being easy and lucrative.\n\nKnown as one of the top ten cryptocurrencies to invest in this year, the DigiToads (TOADS) presale reigns undisputedly as the most lucrative opportunity for traders to position themselves for massive profits. The presale runs in 10 stages, and the first completed stage primes DigiToads (TOADS) for higher prices. The currently ongoing second phase has already gained huge adoption.\n\nInvestors who bought the token ICO are already 20% up on their investment in less than a month. Analysts are optimistic that investors should be up 450% on their investment at the end of the presale. The presale has soared, putting the sales at well over $760,000.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nCardano (ADA) Sees Value Amid Market Downtown\n\nCardano (ADA) is a promising DeFi token with significant attention in cryptocurrency. The token houses a proof-of-stake network that allows for speed and lower energy consumption than other blockchains. Unfortunately, Cardano (ADA) has struggled to maintain momentum recently.\n\nThis stems from a need for more developers in its decentralized applications (dApps) ecosystem, slow progress in achieving laid-out plans, and criticism of Charles Hoskinson, the founder. Also, the contribution of marketing and community engagement struggles and laid-back efforts in building and developing new initiatives resulted in a price downturn.\n\nThe price of Cardano (ADA) consolidates at $0.309 and has a day trading volume of $308,288.498. Cardano (ADA) has dropped by 0.22% over the past 24 hours.\n\nMarket Chaos Keeping Solana (SOL) Down\n\nSolana (SOL) is a well-known token that aims to provide secure transactions for decentralized applications (dApps). Being the fastest in the crypto space, Solana has gained attention for its low transaction fees, which make it an attractive option for developers and users.\n\nDespite its impressive features, Solana (SOL) has also recently struggled to maintain momentum. One reason for this is the increasing competition in the market. Several other blockchain projects, such as Polygon and Binance Smart Chain, have gained significant traction by offering similar features to Solana at a lower cost. This has made it difficult for Solana to differentiate itself and attract new users and developers.\n\nAlthough Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are good projects, bearish fever isn\u2019t an issue for DigiToads. It keeps skyrocketing in price and interaction with large investors (whales) who plan to hold till the end of the token ICO for the perks it provides holders.\n\nFor More Information on DigiToads visit the website, join the presale or join the community\n\nKeywords: DigiToads, TOADS, Cardano, ADA, Solana, SOL, DeFi token, top ten cryptocurrencies, token ICO"

        "title": "3 Cryptos to Help Hedge Against a Possible Recession - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Don't let the next recession catch you off guard! Learn how a surprising collection of cryptocurrencies can be your secret weapon to protect your wealth.\n\nIs a 2023 recession on the horizon? That's the general consensus of economic experts these days, and investors of all stripes are buckling up to face the inevitable storm.\n\nBut there's a plot twist to this downturn. Traditional stocks and bonds may struggle in the months to come, but a surprising asset class could be the answer to your wealth-guarding concerns. I'm talking about cryptocurrencies.\n\nYep, you heard right. The former paragons of volatility and uncertainty may actually be able to safeguard your portfolio in a downturn nowadays. Let me give you the rundown on a trio of cryptos that fit the bill, including why I think they could be an effective recession hedge.\n\nThese ain't your grandpa's recession-proof cryptos!\n\nAll right, I know Bitcoin (BTC 1.69%) and Ethereum (ETH 0.89%) are the names to beat in the crypto world. Lots of people suggest them as hedges against recessions, inflation, the common cold, and unsalted broccoli. Despite their years and years of unpredictable price changes, the biggest boys on the blockchain have earned that respect.\n\nBut if you want to diversify your portfolio and hedge against a recession, there are some lesser-known cryptos that you should consider. These are cryptos with real-world use cases that can help you make some serious dough over time, even if the economy's in a slump. And don't get me wrong -- Bitcoin and Ethereum are still legitimate options. I'm just saying that there may be even better options out there.\n\nAnd that's where my top pick for a recession hedge comes in. Say hello to the mighty Polkadot (DOT -0.62%). With its unique features and killer potential, you really need to know Polkadot on this threshold of a likely recession.\n\n1. Polkadot: The web3 wonder\n\nHere's why Polkadot could be your secret weapon against a recession.\n\nFirst off, it's more than just a simple cryptocurrency. The Polkadot ecosystem is a decentralized portal to an app developer's nirvana, where its coding platform makes it easy to take full advantage of the best qualities in many different blockchains. Polkadot helps these separate chains communicate with each other. This solves a major challenge facing the crypto industry -- interoperability.\n\nPolkadot is still in its early stages of development but has the potential to be a significant player in the crypto sector. In time, a fully developed Polkadot system could even give the economy a boost in a downturn. Yes, I really believe that this project will reach that level of game-changing power in a few years.\n\nWhy? Well, you may know that Polkadot is part of the web3 ecosystem, the next-gen internet built on decentralized tech. But that's not the whole story. This cryptocurrency was actually created by the Web3 Foundation in order to provide exactly the type of fully functional but also decentralized techno-magic the Foundation envisions. If and when web3 disrupts the social media-era internet as we know it, Polkadot will lead the charge.\n\nFurthermore, Polkadot has a sophisticated and decentralized governance structure that should make it more stable than other cryptos. Plus, it's developer-friendly, making it easy to build innovative applications on top of the platform. That combination points to a long and lucrative future of game-changing innovation.\n\nThat's still not the whole story. Polkadot's investor-friendly qualities are plentiful, and I expect this cryptocurrency to gain lots of value in the next few years, whether the economy gets stuck in a recession quagmire or not. This token is a direct bet on a sea change in online business methods and consumer-level financial services.\n\nAs web3 evolves, I'm pretty sure Polkadot will be worth a lot more than the scrawny $8 billion market cap it sports today. There's no such thing as a guaranteed result in the real world, of course. This one comes close, in my opinion.\n\n2. Solana: The digital math rock drummer\n\nNext up is Solana (SOL 0.12%), a so-called \"Ethereum killer\" that can process transactions and smart contracts at lightning speed. This blockchain offers a unique combination of features that could make it a serious contender in the cryptocurrency industry. I'm not saying that Solana will destroy Ethereum and steal its throne, but this crypto market is big enough to support more than one smart contracts platform -- and Solana is the best non-Ethereum alternative I've seen so far.\n\nYou see, Solana brings together a bunch of benefits that may seem incompatible with each other. Its transaction-processing system is completely decentralized, which may seem to slow things down and invite security problems. However, Solana's hybrid consensus process runs two blockchain ledgers in parallel.\n\nThe unique proof-of-history (PoH) chain keeps ultra-accurate time for the hybrid system, letting Solana's proof-of-stake (PoS) chain complete the security analysis of many pending transactions in seemingly random order. Then, the PoH system's timing signals can put the scrambled puzzle pieces together in the correct order.\n\nIt's like having a top-notch drummer in a chaotic math rock band. The rhythm may not make sense from the outside, but everything just works.\n\nThis clever setup routinely handles thousands of blockchain transactions per second (TPS), with an all-time TPS record of nearly 8,500 and a theoretical limit of around 65,000. Planned platform upgrades should soon lift that ceiling to roughly 600,000 TPS. Ethereum and Bitcoin aren't even playing in the same league, with TPS maximums of 30 and 7, respectively.\n\nSo Solana should find plenty of work to do in fields where instant processing is a top priority. High-frequency trading springs to mind, tightly followed by real-time video games and large-scale supply chain management. Don't forget that Solana runs Ethereum-compatible smart contracts on this greased-lightning platform, opening the door to a large and growing market.\n\nNow, Solana may sound perfect, but it does have some issues. Its blockchain network experienced three multihour outages between September 2021 and April 2022, for example. Like a German sports car, there are many moving parts to this advanced technology, and any failure can bring the whole system to a standstill.\n\nCompared to Polkadot, I'm a little bit less convinced that Solana will set up shop in the cryptocurrency sector for the long term. It can earn my trust by winning more development projects and keeping its transaction flow uninterrupted for years to come. For now, it deserves your attention as a somewhat speculative play on Ethereum alternatives.\n\n3. Litecoin's consumer-friendly spin on Bitcoin's code\n\nFinally, let's take a quick look at Litecoin (LTC -0.08%).\n\nLike Bitcoin, Litecoin is a digital asset that operates outside the control of governments and financial institutions. In fact, it started out as a slightly tweaked clone of Bitcoin's technology. Here's where things get interesting: Litecoin has some key advantages that make it a potential recession hedge.\n\nChiefly, Litecoin's block generation rate is set up to run faster than Bitcoin's or even Ethereum's. The main idea behind Litecoin's creation was to make Bitcoin-style cryptocurrencies more useful as a day-to-day payment system. In a perfect world, you'll soon forget where you put your old-school credit cards because the Litecoin-based money-sending app on your phone does everything they used to do. Bitcoin was never meant to do that.\n\nWe're a long way away from a world full of Litecoin payments, and the Bitcoin clone could very well lose that race to other cryptocurrencies with similar design goals, but Litecoin does have a head start and should be considered a heavy favorite. And this is one of those situations where progress toward a new solution may be accelerated by recessions in the global and American economies.\n\nLike Solana, this idea is somewhat speculative, and you might prefer grabbing some plain old Bitcoin instead. Still, I see promise in Litecoin's consumer-friendly system design, and this name deserves a second look."
