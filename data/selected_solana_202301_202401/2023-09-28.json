        "title": "Solana v.1.16 Update Rolls Out, SOL Reclaims 9th Spot in Crypto Market Cap Rankings - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Key highlights:\n\nVersion 1.16 brings under-the-hood tweaks that should speed up Solana nicely and well.\n\nThings like improved zero-knowledge math, disk space savings, and lighter networking mean users and validators alike get a smoother experience. After nearly a year in development, these changes will help SOL fly like the wind.\n\nWith technical signals flashing green and big hackathons firing up innovation, analysts predict a 25% price pop for SOL this October.\n\nThe Solana network validators have begun adopting the v1.16 update, bringing with it several important upgrades and optimizations under the hood. But SOL's resilience was tested recently as another project briefly surpassed it in the crypto rankings - only for Solana to swiftly reclaim its spot.\n\nWhat's new in the v1.16 update?\n\nAs outlined in the official announcement from Solana Labs, v1.16 includes nearly ten months of development work. Among the notable changes, it improves support for advanced zero-knowledge math that enables technologies like confidential transfers. This paves the way for more privacy-oriented decentralized applications to be built on Solana.\n\nOther performance tweaks optimize how ledger data is cleaned up to reduce disk usage. The peer sampling method for gossip messaging was overhauled as well, lessening the bandwidth needed at startup. Validators will also see reduced memory consumption now that the index of the account resides directly on disk by default.\n\nThorough testing by canaries and volunteers\n\nTo ensure quality, v1.16 underwent vigorous testing. This included months on the public testnet with regular stress testing. Solana Labs also ran \"canary\" nodes on the mainnet to monitor stability in real-world conditions. Plus, volunteers helped validate the update earlier by deploying it months ago - this led to swift fixes for minor issues.\n\nWith robust auditing and review from multiple parties, the update is poised to seamlessly supercharge the Solana blockchain. Its smooth rollout shows how the network prioritizes reliability through open collaboration.\n\nSOL reclaims its rightful spot in the rankings\n\nJust as v1.16 was preparing for launch, another player in the crypto sphere nearly stole Solana's thunder. The TON project briefly overtook SOL as the 9th largest project. But like a sly matador in a bullfight, SOL quickly sidestepped the challenger and retook its spot.\n\nAs explained in the recent CoinCodex article, Solana is in the process of breaking out of its downtrend. With key technical signals flashing green, the analyst projects a 25% price increase for SOL this October. And with big developments like the Hyperdrive Hackathon stoking innovation, SOL's position only looks more secure.\n\nSantana estimates SOL has the potential for a 25% price increase by October based on its technical signals. That bullish forecast is looking prescient as SOL has already bounced up slightly over the last 24 hours to $19.22. As the network shows continued progress like the v1.16 update, optimism around SOL's long-term prospects remains high. Check out Solana's price prediction for 2040-2050.\n\nWhile competition from ambitious projects will surely continue, Solana has proven time after time that it has the fundamental strength, developer mindshare, and ongoing upgrades to stay among the crypto elite."

        "content": "Crypto.com Expands Trading Pairs with Ripple\u2019s XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana\n\nIn a strategic move to diversify its offerings and cater to the evolving needs of the cryptocurrency community, Crypto.com has recently announced the integration of new trading pairs on its platform. Notably, users can now trade Ripple-affiliated XRP, the meme-inspired Dogecoin (DOGE), and the high-performance blockchain Solana (SOL) against PayPal USD (PYUSD), a stablecoin introduced by the financial giant PayPal.\n\nThis development represents a significant milestone for Crypto.com, made possible through a collaboration with PayPal and Paxos, solidifying its position as a preferred exchange for PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. The partnership, unveiled recently, expands the accessibility of PYUSD trading pairs, building upon previous integrations.\n\nCrypto.com\u2019s mission has always been to enhance cryptocurrency accessibility for its extensive user base while also contributing to the broader network of PayPal consumers and merchants. This partnership aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nPayPal\u2019s PYUSD Stablecoin: A New Player in the Stablecoin Arena\n\nPayPal made waves in the cryptocurrency space when it launched its native stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), just last month. The stablecoin\u2019s introduction was met with considerable anticipation, with expectations of it simplifying payments and enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nHowever, a recent report by Bank of America suggests that while PYUSD has promise, it may not gain widespread adoption in the near future. The report highlights the challenges PYUSD might face, including competition from other private stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Nevertheless, PayPal\u2019s entry into the stablecoin realm marks a notable step towards embracing digital currencies within the mainstream financial ecosystem.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP: A Resurgence in the Crypto Market\n\nFollowing Ripple\u2019s legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a noticeable shift in market dynamics concerning XRP has emerged. Several prominent cryptocurrency trading platforms, including Crypto.com, have reactivated XRP trading services, signaling a renewed confidence in the digital asset.\n\nDespite this resurgence, the price of XRP has yet to witness a significant elevation, with values still hovering below the $0.50 mark. This modest price movement suggests that market reservations and prevailing uncertainties in the cryptocurrency sphere continue to influence investor sentiment.\n\nCrypto.com\u2019s commitment to offering XRP trading pairs aligns with the broader trend of renewed interest in the digital asset. As regulatory clarity regarding XRP evolves, market participants closely monitor developments that could potentially impact the cryptocurrency\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nCrypto.com\u2019s Vision: Advancing Cryptocurrency Adoption\n\nCrypto.com\u2019s decision to expand its trading pairs and collaborate with industry giants like PayPal underscores its vision of advancing cryptocurrency adoption. By providing users with a diverse range of trading options, including established digital assets like XRP and emerging favorites like Dogecoin and Solana, Crypto.com aims to cater to the evolving preferences of the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, strategic partnerships and innovative offerings like PYUSD trading pairs contribute to the overall growth and accessibility of digital assets. While challenges may persist, the collective efforts of platforms like Crypto.com and industry leaders like PayPal pave the way for a more inclusive and integrated financial ecosystem that encompasses both traditional and digital finance."

        "title": "Is The Solana Price Headed Down Next? 3 Cryptos That Can Outperform SOL In November - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Following a massive 90% price rally, Solana recently hit a peak of around $45, before pulling back to $43. This explosive upside move was driven by hype surrounding Solana\u2019s annual Breakpoint conference from November 1-4.\n\nHowever, now that the conference euphoria is fading, analysts are questioning whether Solana can sustain its mega rally.\n\nSolana Price Prediction November Week 1\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, the recent 80% monthly gain in SOL appears directly tied to speculative pumping ahead of Breakpoint. Their data shows SOL historically pumps leading into the conference, hitting a peak price around the event dates, before declining afterwards. This pattern seems to be playing out once again.\n\nLookonchain also highlighted potential insider selling activity. Recent reports indicate crypto exchange FTX had been steadily offloading its SOL reserves, transferring 2.14 million SOL worth $94 million over the past 10 days. Speculation is that insiders could be artificially inflating prices before unloading holdings.\n\nFTX currently holds around 4.8 million SOL worth $211 million. With only 850,645 SOL worth $37 million left in their wallet and 3.96 million SOL worth $174 million still staked, it\u2019s clear this major holder has been systematically selling off substantial supply. This selling pressure makes SOL\u2019s rally look increasingly unsustainable.\n\nFollowing the over-extended 90% breakout, Solana is now overbought with an RSI around 70 and the SOL price is stalling near strong resistance at $45. Given the evidence of insider distribution, post-conference exhaustion, and overbought conditions, a sizable pullback seems likely.\n\nWhile the long-term blockchain fundamentals remain strong, SOL\u2019s parabolic move has likely run too far, too fast. Once the hype and insider manipulation recede, gravity will likely bring SOL back down to earth in the near-term.\n\nAs Solana loses momentum, here are 3 ultra-bullish cryptos poised to massively outperform SOL:\n\nBitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)\n\nThe red-hot BTCMTX token has already raised over $3.5 million in its presale and continues surging. With its innovative decentralized cloud mining concept allowing staking for Bitcoin rewards, BTCMTX is positioned to explosively outperform Solana.\n\nBTCMTX lets users stake tokens to earn mining credits redeemable for Bitcoin cloud mining slots. This groundbreaking model makes Bitcoin mining accessible to everyday investors, avoiding high hardware costs and scam risks.\n\nThose buying into the current presale price at bitcoinminetrix.com of just $0.0114 per token are maximizing profits, as each new stage sees a 10% price hike. Already in Stage 5, the window is closing fast on the lowest possible entry point.\n\nWith staking rewards of over 150% APY, BTCMTX backers are further turbocharging returns before mining even activates. BTCMTX\u2019s disruptive technology and ultra-low entry point make it primed to massively outpace both sinking Solana and sideways-trading Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nWhile Solana exploded 90% in its unsustainable hype rally, Bitcoin has seen much tamer 30% monthly gains. Following a decisive breakout over $30K resistance, BTC pushed above $35K before pulling back due to overbought RSI conditions.\n\nThis technical correction seems healthy for Bitcoin to consolidate gains and prepare its next leg up. Investors are looking for a pullback for another swing entry opportunity. Where could the price pull back to? Nearest Fibonacci retracement levels are $33K (23.6%) and $32K (38.80%, according to altFINS.\n\nThe key driver on everyone\u2019s mind is the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval in early 2024. If the SEC greenlights this, analysts foresee an influx of institutional capital that could rocket BTC\u2019s price upwards.\n\nWhile some believe a spot ETF is already priced in, approval would likely still spark significant upside. Without the ETF catalyst, Bitcoin\u2019s price progress may significantly lag. But either way, BTC remains solidly out of its bear market downtrend.\n\nWith less downside risk and more sustainable upside potential, the prudent Bitcoin is poised to decidedly outperform the over-extended Solana in coming months.\n\nMeme Kombat (MK)\n\nThis unique meme-powered crypto gaming platform has raised over $1.25 million at ICO as investors buy in early. Blending staking, gambling, and Play2Earn gaming in a meme battle setting, Meme Kombat leverages proven trends to disrupt both crypto gaming and meme coins.\n\nUsers can bet on meme battle outcomes while staking and earning 112% APY on $MK tokens. The presale price already increased from $0.15 to $0.183, with just 2 days left until the next price round at memekombat.io. With explosive buzz and flawless tokenomics, $MK is projected to ascend the meme coin ranks.\n\nMeme Kombat allows staking MK to bet on meme battles, with chances to win more tokens or prizes. Its meme-powered metaverse creates endless engagement opportunities, while the 112% staking APY enables earnings even before gaming activates.\n\nBy merging high-yield staking with interactive gaming, gambling, and meme culture, Meme Kombat may be primed to generate high returns and outperform other sectors \u2013 already catching the attention of some of the top crypto Twitter traders.\n\nNew presale i am bring some awareness too .. Legends at @Meme_Kombat who are an innovative new gaming platform designed for hardcore gamers. \u2013 Doxxed team \u2705\n\n\u2013 $100,000 raised already \u2705\n\n\u2013 Passive staking \u2705\n\n\u2013 AD / NFA / DYOR \u2705 \u2013 Presale link : https://t.co/TWAEnq5WG0\n\n\u2013 TG :\u2026 pic.twitter.com/r6xtdbBmeX \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) September 28, 2023\n\nConclusion\n\nWith Solana flashing warning signs of an imminent comedown from its overheated rally, savvy investors are eyeing projects equipped to outpace SOL\u2019s gains sustainably. Bitcoin Minetrix, Bitcoin, and Meme Kombat represent three high-upside cryptos ideally positioned to deliver outstanding returns as Solana falters.\n\nTheir rock-solid fundamentals, ideal timing, and tremendous growth trajectories point to huge outperformance potential ahead."

        "title": "Solana NFT Projects: A Comprehensive Guide - CoinGecko Buzz",
        "content": "*This picture is for image illustration purposes and should not be taken as financial or investment advice\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nSolana has its list of blue-chip NFT projects, including DeGods, Taiyo Robotics, Blocksmith Labs (BSL), and Famous Fox Federation.\n\nIf you don't mint your own NFTs, there are secondary marketplaces to purchase Solana NFTs, such as Magic Eden that accounts for around 90% of trading volume.\n\nDYOR with charting tools, unlock liquidity with NFT lending protocols, and snipe coveted NFTs using sniper bots.\n\nSolana NFTs have been making a lot of noise lately. But most, if not all the necessary info on Solana NFTs is gated to Crypto Twitter or Discord. That's why this guide isn't going to be like any other Solana NFT guide you've ever read. That's my promise to you right now. There's no mention of Okay Bears, no Cets on Creck, nada. (I see these more as brand plays, and on Solana, we like to invest in builders.)\n\nBuilders are the meta in the Solana NFT space. That's why all the projects mentioned in this piece have a strong team of builders behind them. Now let's take a look at how you can go from zero to NFT degen mastery by the end of this guide.\n\nFirst, we'll cover a list of blue-chip projects. Afterward, we'll discuss how and where you can buy these Solana NFTs. Then we'll go over a few Solana-specific NFT tools to give you a massive\u2014and I mean, massive\u2014advantage when it comes to collecting NFTs.\n\nAfter that, we'll go over how to mint NFTs for new projects real quick. Then we'll close with some thoughts on where Solana NFTs are going from here, okay? Okay.\n\nLet's get to it then!\n\nA List of Blue-Chip Solana NFT Projects\n\nBelow, we present a list of blue-chip NFT projects. By \"blue chip\", we're referring to OG projects that have cemented their presence in the NFT space. And more often than not, they've also helped lift up the Solana ecosystem as a whole.\n\nDeGods: Still the Holy Grail?\n\nSource: DeGods\n\nThe blue chip of Solana, DeGods is an OG project that recently joined the ranks of the Top 5 NFT projects by market cap. The Top 5 include the likes of Crypto Punks and Bored Ape Yacht Club. In fact, DeGods is the only Solana project featured in the Top 5.\n\nSo what makes DeGods hit different? Is it the marketing? The community vibes? Whatever it is, this project is on a different wave.\n\nMaybe it's got to do with the fact that they never encouraged crypto users to go out and spam for whitelist spots. Instead, DeGods was the first project to offer these spots in the form of bounties.\n\nThe bounties produced a plethora of genius marketing material. From one holder trying to convince his mom to buy DeGods to another holder flying out of a plane dressed as a DeGod, the project quickly went viral.\n\nToday, prominent holders include both Solana co-founders as well as rapper Ice Cube. But that's not the only thing that makes this project special.\n\nDeGods is actually the first deflationary NFT project. Way back when, if anyone tried to sell their DeGod below the floor price, something happened. The sale would trigger what came to be known as the Paper Hands B***H Tax (PHBT).\n\nThat's a 33.3% royalties fee that would be tacked on and redirected to DeDAO. (These royalties have since been removed.) At the time, the sold DeGod would be burned as well, thus decreasing the supply over time.\n\nAnd if you own an original DeGod, it can be transcended for an art upgrade, into a DeadGod. You need 1000 DUST tokens to achieve transcendence. By the way, you can check out the roadmap below.\n\nSource: DeGods\n\nThe founder, Frank, isn't doxxed, but he obviously cares dearly for the community. I mention this because Frank has recently drawn some controversy after the team's decision to drop creator royalties from their collections.\n\nI can't speak for Frank, but I do know a thing or two because I follow the space closely. Marketplaces that have removed creator royalties have been launching on Solana. That's just the way the market's been trending for some time, and the writing was on the wall.\n\nIf you give sellers the option to remove creator royalties, that's what they'll do. After all, royalties aren't enforceable on-chain.\n\ny00ts: Enter the Controversy\n\nSource: y00ts\n\nOnly the DeGods team could have triggered an NFT bull run during a bear market, and they did just that. y00ts, the second project by Frank, was to launch under the newly formed Dust Labs.\n\nThen, once all 15,000 y00ts had been sold pre-reveal, Frank announced that the reveals would be postponed. All the artwork was scrapped, and they announced they would start from scratch.\n\nAt around the same time, Magic Eden (ME), the most popular Solana NFT marketplace by trading volume, reversed their position and announced optional creator royalties.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nOn Crypto Twitter (CT), accusations were thrown around pointing fingers at Frank. Former fans shouted \"Collusion!\" from the rooftops. Some suspected that Frank knew about ME's announcement beforehand. That's why he rushed the y00ts sales to collect all the royalties he could before ME announced it.\n\nIs there any actual evidence? No. It's circumstantial, at best. And if you follow Frank, you know his commitment to his community and to the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nStill, the situation has gotten pretty ugly at times. But I'll be holding onto my DeGod and my y00t. When we're down bad, CT tends to get toxic. Let's see if we're all frens again when we're back up. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nTaiyo Robotics\n\nSource: Taiyo Robotics\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to call Taiyo Robotics an NFT project. It's way more accurate to call Taiyo an ecosystem. What even many fans of the project don't know is that Taiyo... is a de-rug.\n\nStory goes, Solport Tom, the founder, had been offering tech solutions to projects. In the midst of it all, he was also working on launching a marketplace called Solport. But after a battle with ME, they decided that the best way forward would be to focus on launchpad services.\n\nTaiyo Robotics was one of Solport's development clients. Tom's team was commissioned to create a custom marketplace for assets. But unfortunately, they ended up rugging. Not wanting the bad rep for the Solport community, Tom decided to step in and try to provide value to the Taiyo brand.\n\nThe project's rugged token, SCRAP, was repurposed for Taiyo staking. But unlike most stake-and-forget projects, Tom didn't stop building from there. With Taiyo Infants, gen2 Taiyo NFTs were born. To get your hands on one, you had to purchase an incubator and reveal yours, or you had to breed them with two parents (gen1).\n\nNow, Tom's working on something bigger.\n\nSource: Taiyo Pilots\n\nA mint date for the new Taiyo Pilots is imminent. Pilots can consume Taiyo robotics products and get rewarded for engaging in Taiyo activities. These include minting on their minting protocol or buying custom assets from their marketplaces.\n\nIn exchange, Pilots can receive Graphite (GP), in addition to other discounts for participating in the ecosystem. Graphite is a new token that's about to be released. To the best of my knowledge, it's the only token that's undergone extensive reviews. These reviews included investors donning serious suits in massive boardrooms with a pitch deck. Not something you see every day in the NFT space.\n\nYou'll be able to stake your Taiyo Gen1 and Gen2 directly for GP\u2014but with a catch. GP can be earned via milestone staking. This innovative staking method involves staking your NFT to accrue more rewards every x number of days.\n\nFeels like... Another Taiyo Win.\n\nBlocksmith Labs (BSL)\n\nSource: Blocksmith Labs\n\nAlex, the founder of Blocksmith Labs (BSL), is a dev who goes by the handle @cryptonent. By the way, he's the original lead dev for DeGods. BSL has an impressive list of tools they've released. And these tools are used throughout the ecosystem.\n\nBSL has a product suite of four tools that makes life easier for NFT projects:\n\n1. Mercury is a whitelist management tool for NFT projects. It also provides a mint calendar with important mint dates. Mercury also includes sections for raffles, auctions, and rewards.\n\n2. Bifrost is BSL's launchpad. It's one of the most successful NFT launchpads when you consider some of the launches. Prominent projects that have launched with BSL include Sharx (Sharky.fi) and Froots.\n\n3. Shift is an NFT art upgrade tool that makes it super easy for project owners to manage their art upgrades.\n\n4. Raven is a gamified marketing platform for projects to post bounties in exchange for likes and retweets.\n\nAn art upgrade is on the horizon for BSL NFTs. You can upgrade your BSL by paying for the upgrade with FORGE tokens. At present, you can earn 10 FORGE/day by staking your BSL.\n\nFamous Fox Federation\n\nSource: Famous Fox Federation\n\nIf you've heard of the Famous Fox Federation (FFF), you might mistake them for a gamified profile pic (PFP) project. But their founders are actually some of the most innovative in the space.\n\nFoxydev is... you guessed it, a dev. He's also one of the straightest shooters you'll ever meet. You might even think he's rude because, unlike other founders, he won't rub your feet to keep you as a holder. If you want to sell, he'll tell you to sell, dammit.\n\nHere's a short list of stuff the foxes have created:\n\n- A token marketplace\n\n- A raffle house\n\n- An NFT messaging service\n\n- Marmalade, an art commission marketplace\n\n- FoxyList, where you can bulk-list your NFTs\n\n... and many, many more. Seriously. We're only scratching the surface.\n\nBy the way, you can send your foxes on missions. In exchange, your foxes acquire FAME, which can only be earned via missions. Missions also earn you chests rewards. You can also purchase FAME with FOXY tokens. (Currently, staking your FFF NFT earns you 100 FOXY/day.)\n\nRight now, you can level up your foxes to level 40. That's when you can unlock special traits that upgrade the artwork of your NFT. Each trait (e.g., a hat or shirt upgrade) costs 10,000 FOXY tokens.\n\nSource: Famous Fox Federation\n\nYou can use your FOXY tokens throughout the Foxyverse. The Foxyverse also includes adorable pixelated versions of the original FFF NFTs. These guys are known as the Transdimensional Famous Foxes. You can also buy dens for your foxes, and rooms for your dens, as well as some unique 1:1 art pieces.\n\nIt's a fun OG project, and it looks like it isn't going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nHow to Buy NFTs on Solana\n\nThere's no shortage of secondary marketplaces for NFTs on the Solana chain. Let's review a few.\n\nMagic Eden\n\nSource: Magic Eden\n\nYou may have heard of Magic Eden (ME) before this guide. For any Solana NFT newcomer, ME is the most obvious spot to shop for your Solana NFTs. After all, with roughly 90% of the trading volume, ME's got Solana marketplaces on lockdown.\n\nSource: Hellomoon.io\n\nIt hasn't been a smooth ride though. As a rapidly growing company, it's been embroiled in a few controversies outside of the royalty issue. For instance, users have accused the platform of promoting rugs, the most notorious being DegenTown.\n\nHadeSwap\n\nSource: HadeSwap\n\nIf you're familiar with Sudoswap on Ethereum, HadeSwap is Sudoswap's sister on Solana. This means that you can buy into collections over time based on custom bonding curves that you've set. You can also sell out of collections the same way. (If you want to dig deeper into how HadeSwap works, check out my article on Sudoswap here.)\n\nIn other words, HadeSwap gives you a ton of automation control over your digital assets. Specifically, you can set up three types of pools:\n\n1. A buy pool\n\n2. A sell pool\n\n3. A liquidity pool (LP) for earning fees\n\nWhen setting up an LP, you select your NFT/s and deposit an equal amount of the NFT's floor price value into the pool. By providing liquidity to HadeSwap in the form of tokens and NFTs, you're rewarded with platform fees.\n\nHadeswap has an NFT collection, by the way. It's unclear what benefits will accrue to holders of ABC, because apparently it's a secret. (I love secrets.) That's what the documentation says, anyway. We'll just have to wait and see.\n\nABC is worth checking out. Enjoy using HadeSwap and believe it's got a future on Solana? If you like kid drawings, ABC looks like the entire collection was drawn by one. It's a community-driven project, with a fun vibe to boot.\n\nHyperspace.xyz\n\nSource: Hyperspace.xyz\n\nHyperspace is the NFT marketplace aggregator on Solana. All that means is that it pulls data from all the secondary marketplaces, including automated market makers. That way, you get the \"true\" market price, instead of the one displayed on any single marketplace. And you can buy direct from Hyperspace. (Zero redirects!)\n\nHyperspace only charges a reasonable 1% for seller fees. Some users have complained, but come on. The team needs to pay themselves to continue building, right? Another cool thing about the platform is that you never lose custody of your assets. Your NFTs will always remain in your wallet, even after you've listed them, until the point of sale.\n\nThe platform also allows users to post Collection Bids, where you can post any offer for a collection. On the seller's side, anyone who needs immediate liquidity can press a button and accept the offer.\n\nBoom. NFT gone. Liquidity now!\n\nLastly, because Hyperspace is an aggregator, the floor price displayed on the platform is the true floor price. Other platforms, for example, only display the floor price of the NFTs listed on their marketplace.\n\nNot so with Hyperspace.\n\nDid you want to be a janitor growing up? Well, now you can live your dream, baby! Just pick up a broom and start sweepin' \ud83e\uddf9\n\nSo far, we've looked at a handful of promising OG Solana NFT collections. We've also covered marketplaces where you can purchase them. Now let's go over several indispensable Solana-specific NFT tools to make DYOR easy.\n\nHellomoon.io\n\nSource: Hellomoon.io\n\nHellomoon.io is a charting tool for Solana NFTs, but it's got a bit more to offer than just that. For instance, the homepage dashboard is a treasure trove of data. You get a critical snapshot of which projects are experiencing the most smart money inflows and outflows.\n\nClicking on the \"NFT Ecosystem Analysis\" tab below pulls up detailed charts. They include critical metrics like marketplace volume, cumulative unique owners, and weekly buyers vs. sellers.\n\nOnce you connect your crypto wallet, you can browse your Solana portfolio too. What's awesome here is that Hellomoon.io provides you with your P&L percentages, as well as the USD value of your potential earnings and losses.\n\nSniper Bots\n\nSource: Smart Sea Society\n\nSniper bots used to be all the rage in 2021. At one point, it seemed that a different sniper project was launching every week. Rarikeys. Smart Sea Society. (Much more than just a sniper bot project, by the way.) Pengsol. Even smaller projects like Saiba Labs have incorporated snipers directly into the Discord.\n\nHere's how a sniper bot works. Say you want a DeGod, but you don't want to pay 280 SOL for it. You tell yourself, \"Someone out there's got some fat fingers, or is going to want some fast liquidity.\"\n\nSo maybe you set it to 250. Maybe you set it to 28. Either way, as soon as someone lists it, it's gone. If you as a human were watching the listings waiting for it to pop up, you're already too late. The bot is faster than what populates in the graphical user interface.\n\nTraditionally, these sniper bots have been pulling data from secondary markets like ME and the Famous Fox Token Market. But the best sniper would undoubtedly be one that pulls data directly from on-chain.\n\nWho will come out on top with the best sniper bots?\n\nSharky.Fi\n\nSource: Sharky.Fi\n\nSharky is an NFT lending protocol, and it's my favorite tool on this list. If you've got even a small amount of capital, you can grow it considerably here by acting as a lender. (We're talking up to 240% APY for some projects, with weekly to bimonthly payouts!) And as a borrower, you get immediate access to liquidity. Pretty cool, eh?\n\nSo what are the risks?\n\nLike every lending protocol, on the borrower's end, the borrower puts up collateral. But on Sharky.fi, the collateral is NFTs. So let's say the floor price of an NFT project is 150 SOL. Because the borrower must \"over-collateralize\" to take out a loan, the loan amount is lower than the floor price.\n\nOn Sharky.fi, it works like this. The borrower has access to a list of offer amounts proposed by lenders. The borrower picks the amount they want to borrow, and puts up their NFT as collateral.\n\nWhat happens when the borrower defaults on their loan? (In other words, what if they're unable to pay back the full borrowed sum, in addition to the interest, by the deadline?) Then the borrower forfeits their NFT, but they do get to keep the borrowed amount as capital.\n\nIf you're a lender, this is how you play. Once your offer has been accepted, wait until the deadline and collect the sum you've lent out, plus interest. Should the borrower default, you get to keep the collateralized NFT at its full value.\n\nNow that's what I call a win-win.\n\nDAOs: A treasure trove for alpha calls Alpha signals (or alpha calls) are buy/sell signals offered to the community by holders of a specific NFT project. Alpha callers are roles designated for this purpose. Some alpha callers are well known in the space\u2014but be careful when you're listening to calls on CT. These calls tend to be unreliable, and you very well could end up being someone else's Exit Liquidity. The best place to look for alpha callers is in reputable NFT DAOs. These DAOs are run by popular projects like the ones discussed above. Inside these DAOs, NFT traders, some with deep pockets, trade calls and advice.\n\nHow to Mint Solana NFTs\n\nSource: Blocksmith Labs\n\nYou can mint NFTs on Solana in two ways:\n\n1. Use a launchpad\n\n2. Mint directly on the project's website\n\nThere are so many launchpads now. Out of the handful of projects we've mentioned, Taiyo Robotics, BSL, and Saiba Labs all have their own launchpads. Minting on a launchpad is easy\u2014and it can be dirt cheap too, if you're a project holder. Holders can qualify for early mints, as well as discounts.\n\nContrast this to minting directly on a project's website. When you go this route, you should take a few precautions. First, make sure that the project is reliable. Launchpads tend to do their due diligence, although rugs have been known to happen. (Scammers be scammin'.)\n\nSecond, review the website address. I've been burned before by trying to engage with a malicious smart contract on a misspelled website URL. Lastly, use a burner wallet, and make sure it's got enough SOL to cover transaction fees.\n\nIf you don't know how to create a burner wallet, it's easy. Here's how:\n\n1. Open up your Phantom wallet (i.e., the most user-friendly Solana wallet).\n\n2. Click on the top-left icon to reveal a pulldown of your Settings.\n\nSource: Phantom | Unsplash\n\n3. Click on the first option, which is your wallet address.\n\n4. On the \"Your Accounts\" screen, at the bottom of the screen, click on \"Add/Connect Wallet\".\n\nSource: Phantom | Unsplash\n\n5. Click \"Create a new wallet\".\n\nThere you have it. That's your burner wallet.\n\nProtip: It's best if you label your wallets so you never mistake one for another. (Can you imagine the calamity waiting to befall you if you mistook your blue-chip wallet for your burner? You could end up losing all your prized and precious NFTs.)\n\nHere's how you can label your wallet. Repeat the steps above until you reach \"Your Accounts\" again.\n\nSource: Phantom | Unsplash\n\nBut this time, click on the hamburger menu (i.e., the three dots) next to your new wallet address. Once another screen appears, you can click on \"Wallet Name\" and input your new wallet address. That's all, folks!\n\nSolana NFTs: Where do we go from here?\n\nSource: Leyre | Unsplash\n\nWill Solana win the NFT game? No one knows for sure. Just a few weeks ago, it seemed like a sure thing. Today, with all these marketplaces duking it out over creator royalties, things couldn't feel any more bearish.\n\nBut there's light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nWhen marketplaces are vying for control, they're forced to innovate. The game is Adapt or Die. And when the dust settles, the most innovative marketplaces will win, those that treat their users and projects with respect. (Projects deserve to be protected, not just end-users including NFT collectors and traders.)\n\nIn other words, when marketplaces fight over market share via innovation, the consumer wins. Whether the scenario will play out that way is anyone's guess, though.\n\nBut I do know one thing for sure. Regardless of all the toxicity that can permeate the space sometimes, I started out with NFTs on Ethereum, but Solana still feels like home. \u2764\ufe0f"
