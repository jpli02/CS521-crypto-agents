        "content": "According to a blog post by layer 2 blockchain\u2019s organisation, Optimism Collective, Optimism Network launched a token airdrop on Thursday, releasing 11.7 million governance tokens to over 300,000 wallets.\n\nThe airdrop is a part of the blockchain\u2019s plan to distribute 19% of its initial governance token supply as it forges a road to greater acceptance. Optimism delivered 5% of its initial supply of governance tokens, or roughly 200 million tokens, in its first airdrop in May last year.\n\nThe airdrop occurs as Optimism attempts to gain an advantage over its most significant competitor, Arbitrum, a second Ethereum layer without a token. Abritrum presently has more than twice as many active wallets as Optimism, with the difference between the two exchanges\u2019 active wallets expanding over the previous month.\n\nUsers who spent gas on the blockchain to execute transactions qualified for the airdrop, as did those who delegated the voting abilities that governance tokens provide to other users. The Optimism Network acknowledges the distribution of voting privileges as a positive sum action to strengthen the governance system of the blockchain.\n\nThe token dropped 13% upon hearing the circulating supply of Optimism had increased. Despite this, OP has gained approximately 200% over the previous three weeks. The token trades for around $2.35 per unit at the time of publishing.\n\nUnlike Optimism\u2019s initial effort in July 2022, when customers were required to claim their allotments physically, Thursday\u2019s unexpected airdrop ran surprisingly well. In this instance, distribution occurred automatically."

        "title": "6 Web3 Social Media Apps To Keep an Eye On - Blockworks",
        "content": "Big Tech companies have reached high valuations and mammoth user bases, all while collecting personal data of their users. Developers and digital natives are now demanding safer platforms that protect their data and offer them total ownership and creative liberty over everything they post online.\n\nA recent report by consumer intelligence firm Talkwalker shows decentralized social media platforms are shaping up to have the biggest impact on social media channels in 2023. This move toward decentralized networks is expected to grow as users seek greater control over their data and privacy.\n\n\u201cThese startup decentralized networks may not take over in 2023, but they will cause big players to take notice,\u201d the report said.\n\nHere are some Web3 social media apps industry observers are talking about:\n\nLens Protocol\n\nDeFi liquidity protocol Aave\u2019s last year launched Lens Protocol, a Web3 social graph said to give users complete creative and monetary ownership over their data and content. Built on Polygon\u2019s proof-of-stake blockchain, the open-source tech stack allows users to monetize through community-based tools like \u201cmirroring,\u201d its own version of retweets, and portability \u2014 which enables users to \u201cdistribute once, distribute everywhere.\u201d\n\nLens has over 100,000 active profiles and has so far surpassed 12 million gasless transactions. The team is currently working to bring over 100 applications to market, and five of those are already consumer ready, including Web3 Twitter alternative Lenster.\n\nDamus\n\nJack Dorsey-backed Nostr recently launched its own decentralized social media protocol called Damus, which enables end-to-end private messaging between users. The app aims to disrupt traditional social media by creating a censorship-resistant global network where users can\u2019t be identified by their name or user handle, but rather by a public key.\n\nAccording to Nostr band data, the network has over 524,000 profiles with bio attached and more than 30,000 daily new users as of early February.\n\nChingari\n\nOn-chain social network Chingari recently expanded its community by bringing on Aptos as its preferred layer-1, moving on from Solana. Chingari\u2019s user base has sprouted to more than 2.2 million users in 2022 and subscription revenue came to $700,000 in January this year alone, according to the company.\n\nChingari is a video-sharing mobile app on which users can create original videos and use augmented reality filters. It has more than 5 million daily active users and 40 million monthly active users. It is among the top 20 most downloaded apps around the world on Google Play.\n\nThe newer version of the Chingari app, including the migration to Aptos, is expected to go live in the second quarter this year. The app is currently available in India, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkey and the US.\n\nTaki\n\nBuilt on Solana, Taki is a tokenized social network that aims to create a community by rewarding users with an active stake in itself per token. Users can earn social crypto tokens (TAKI) simply by posting content and interacting with others through posts or commenting. TAKI can then be used to purchase user coins, representing the value and influence creators bring to the platform.\n\nThe platform has more than 820,000 users and a similar amount of unique user coins, according to statistics on its website.\n\nDSCVR\n\nLaunched on Internet Computer in 2021, DSCVR (pronounced \u201cdiscover\u201d) was founded by three friends. It describes itself as similar to Reddit, but if its development was governed by a few of its most dedicated users. A Medium blog states that one of its goals is to become an \u201calternative for anyone who uses Reddit.\u201d\n\nIt chose the Internet Computer protocol because the blockchains give it \u201cthe web speed you need to bridge the gap between users who are used to centralized product experiences, yet on decentralized technology.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s estimated to have close to 200,000 users, and all control not just the content, but the platform too.\n\nBison Relay\n\nDecred launched Bison Relay last year, a platform that offers \u201czero knowledge communications\u201d with end-to-end encryption ensuring only intended recipients view the content of messages. Like Nostr, it also aims to be censorship-resistant. And the operators that run the network are unable to see what content users are sharing or which chats they are engaged in, a key effort to combat censorship.\n\nCurrently, its user base consists of only 50 to 70 people.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "What investors need to know about 'staking,' the passive income opportunity at the center of crypto's latest regulation ... - CNBC",
        "content": "Not six months ago, ether led a recovery in cryptocurrency prices ahead of a big tech upgrade that would make something called \"staking\" available to crypto investors.\n\nMost people have hardly wrapped their heads around the concept, but now, the price of ether is falling amid mounting fears that the Securities and Exchange Commission could crack down on it.\n\nOn Thursday, Kraken, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, closed its staking program in a $30 million settlement with the SEC, which said the company failed to register the offer and sale of its crypto staking-as-a-service program.\n\nThe night before, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong warned his Twitter followers that the securities regulator may want more broadly to end staking for U.S. retail customers.\n\n\"This should put everyone on notice in this marketplace,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Friday morning. \"Whether you call it lend, earn, yield, whether you offer an annual percentage yield \u2013 that doesn't matter. If someone is taking [customer] tokens and transferring to their platform, the platform controls it.\"\n\nStaking has widely been seen as a catalyst for mainstream adoption of crypto and a big revenue opportunity for exchanges like Coinbase. A clampdown on staking, and staking services, could have damaging consequences not just for those exchanges, but also Ethereum and other proof-of-stake blockchain networks. To understand why, it helps to have a basic understanding of the activity in question.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWhat is staking?\n\nStaking is a way for investors to earn passive yield on their cryptocurrency holdings by locking tokens up on the network for a period of time. For example, if you decide you want to stake your ether holdings, you would do so on the Ethereum network. The bottom line is it allows investors to put their crypto to work if they're not planning to sell it anytime soon.\n\nHow does staking work?\n\nStaking is sometimes referred to as the crypto version of a high-interest savings account, but there's a major flaw in that comparison: crypto networks are decentralized, and banking institutions are not.\n\nEarning interest through staking is not the same thing as earning interest from a high annual percentage yield offered by a centralized platform like those that ran into trouble last year, like BlockFi and Celsius, or Gemini just last month. Those offerings really were more akin to a savings account: people would deposit their crypto with centralized entities that lent those funds out and promised rewards to the depositors in interest (of up to 20% in some cases). Rewards vary by network but generally, the more you stake, the more you earn.\n\nBy contrast, when you stake your crypto, you are contributing to the proof-of-stake system that keeps decentralized networks like Ethereum running and secure; you become a \"validator\" on the blockchain, meaning you verify and process the transactions as they come through, if chosen by the algorithm. The selection is semi-random \u2013 the more crypto you stake, the more likely you'll be chosen as a validator.\n\nThe lock-up of your funds serves as a sort of collateral that can be destroyed if you as a validator act dishonestly or insincerely.\n\nThis is true only for proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and Cardano. A proof-of-work network like Bitcoin uses a different process to confirm transactions.\n\nStaking as a service\n\nIn most cases, investors won't be staking themselves \u2013 the process of validating network transactions is just impractical on both the retail and institutional levels.\n\nThat's where crypto service providers like Coinbase, and formerly Kraken, come in. Investors can give their crypto to the staking service and the service does the staking on the investors' behalf. When using a staking service, the lock-up period is determined by the networks (like Ethereum or Solana), and not the third party (like Coinbase or Kraken).\n\nIt's also where it gets a little murky with the SEC, which said Thursday that Kraken should have registered the offer and sale of the crypto asset staking-as-a-service program with the securities regulator.\n\nWhile the SEC hasn't given formal guidance on what crypto assets it deems securities, it generally sees a red flag if someone makes an investment with a reasonable expectation of profits that would be derived from the work or effort of others.\n\nCoinbase has about 15% of the market share of Ethereum assets, according to Oppenheimer. The industry's current retail staking participation rate is 13.7% and growing.\n\nProof-of-stake vs. proof-of-work\n\nStaking works only for proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and Cardano. A proof-of-work network, like Bitcoin, uses a different process to confirm transactions.\n\nThe two are simply the protocols used to secure cryptocurrency networks.\n\nProof-of-work requires specialized computing equipment, like high-end graphics cards to validate transactions by solving highly complex math problems. Validators gets rewards for each transaction they confirm. This process requires a ton of energy to complete.\n\nEthereum's big migration to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work improved its energy efficiency almost 100%.\n\nRisks involved\n\nThe source of return in staking is different from traditional markets. There aren't humans on the other side promising returns, but rather the protocol itself paying investors to run the computational network.\n\nDespite how far crypto has come, it's still a young industry filled with technological risks, and potential bugs in the code is a big one. If the system doesn't work as expected, it's possible investors could lose some of their staked coins.\n\nVolatility is and has always been a somewhat attractive feature in crypto but it comes with risks, too. One of the biggest risks investors face in staking is simply a drop in the price. Sometimes a big decline can lead smaller projects to hike their rates to make a potential opportunity more attractive."

        "title": "Super Bowl crypto ads: how much you've lost if you listened to Larry David or Matt Damon last year. - Slate",
        "content": "Happy Super Bowl weekend! Remember last year\u2019s game? More importantly, remember all the cryptocurrency ads? I bet you do, and I bet you\u2019re wondering whether you\u2019ll be deluged with them again. Worry not: A Fox Sports executive has said crypto will have \u201czero representation\u201d during Sunday\u2019s show, with the exceptions of a blockchain-based gaming firm\u2019s ad and an ongoing, but already retro-feeling, partnership between the Super Bowl and Reddit involving NFT avatars\u2014which, to judge from social media interactions, is going about as well as you might expect:\n\nWho here has received their #SBLVII Collectible Avatar? Let\u2019s see our starting lineup below. \ud83c\udfc8\ud83d\udc47 \u2014 Reddit (@Reddit) February 8, 2023\n\nLast year\u2019s game coincided with the peak for the crypto industry, fueled by lockdown-inspired interest in alternative currencies as well as mass hype around nonfungible tokens. Riding that wave into 2022, a bunch of crypto exchanges spent big for that year\u2019s Super Bowl, and the results were pretty weird: an animated QR code offering $15 in Bitcoin from Coinbase, some cross-generational guidance from Crypto.com, and, of course, the now-infamous FTX spots. Those three exchanges, along with the Israeli investment firm eToro, spent a collective total of $54 million on such commercials. (Incidentally, Fox Sports\u2019 parent company, Fox Corporation, was also revealed to be an FTX corporate creditor during the latter\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking back at that digital gold rush a year later, with the cryptoverse shaken by a series of scandals and bankruptcies and much, much lower coin valuations, one can\u2019t help but wonder just what was the ultimate result of those celebrity-endorsed virtual-currency ads. After all, if you took inspiration from Tom Brady or Larry David and invested in the space\u2014whether in the form of Ethereum token purchases, crypto-company stocks, or a high-yield cash stash in an exchange\u2014you have likely fallen underwater on your investment or lost it entirely, and there may be little relief available, despite a small rally in Bitcoin\u2019s price. The new year hasn\u2019t given this sector much relief, and crypto funds aren\u2019t going to rebound in time for another Super Bowl commercial splurge. Not that they\u2019re wanted: The Associated Press reported Sunday that multiple crypto-ad deals had been on the table for this year\u2019s Super Bowl, until FTX went under and demolished everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we look ahead to this year\u2019s matchup, let\u2019s pause and remember the crypto ads that came before, the celebrities they featured, and just how much money you lost if one of crypto\u2019s greater fools was you. Special thanks to CoinDesk for its nifty price charts.\n\nLeBron James\n\nFeb. 13, 2022. Crypto.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummary: On Jan. 28, LeBron James announced a multiyear partnership with Crypto.com, with the exchange saying it would support the NBA star\u2019s charitable foundation by providing \u201ceducational and workforce development opportunities focused on Web3.\u201d By Feb. 13, Crypto.com was ready for its Super Bowl ad debut, featuring LeBron talking to his 18-year-old self in 2003 about all the technological wonders the future will bring: AirPods! Music streaming on your phone! Electric cars! Crypto, specifically, does not come up until the very end, when you see the Crypto.com logo. All as \u201cThe Next Episode\u201d plays in the background.\n\nSlogan: \u201cWe going to the league! We going to the league!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarket impact: It\u2019s likely that James\u2019 commercial inspired some users to sign up as users at Crypto.com. Indeed, the NBA was a particular focus for crypto last year, as it spent more than $130 million in sponsorships for the league, per CNN. But according to the crypto-analyst firm CoinGecko, Crypto.com\u2019s trading volume saw only a small bump following the ad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow boned are you? Let\u2019s say you signed up for Crypto.com right after James\u2019 ad and procured yourself one (1) Bitcoin. That coin, then worth $42,067.76, is now worth $21,749.96\u2014a 48 percent plunge in value.\n\nWhat about other tokens?\n\n\u2022 Ethereum: 1 token of ETH was worth $2,782.80 on game day. Now, it\u2019s worth $1,522.23\u2014a 45 percent fall.\n\n\u2022 Dogecoin: 1 DOGE was worth about, well, 15 cents on game day. Now it\u2019s only 8 cents, if trading in pennies like that is your thing.\n\n\u2022 Solana: 1 SOL was worth $92.86 on game day. Now? A measly $20.48, entailing a 78 percent fall.\n\nLarry David\n\nFeb. 13, 2022. FTX\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummary: The Seinfeld co-creator admitted he didn\u2019t quite understand crypto before filming a Super Bowl commercial for the exchange FTX. Neither did the commercial\u2019s director, Jeff Schaffer, a longtime Larry David collaborator. (Schaffer told the New York Times that he \u201cwas not paid in virtual currency\u201d for his work.) Anyway, the ad shows Larry David, in various costumes, being skeptical of important inventions throughout history: the wheel, the lightbulb, American democracy, and more. Today, David is skeptical of crypto. Hmm!\n\nSlogan: \u201cI\u2019m never wrong about this stuff.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarket impact: According to Protocol, FTX\u2019s app jumped up the App Store\u2019s download rankings right after the Super Bowl, and eventually surpassed Coinbase in Bitcoin trading volume three months later. Obviously, that rally didn\u2019t last long. (Oh, and Larry David is getting sued for that ad, along with FTX\u2019s other celebrity ambassadors.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow boned are you? Again, your fresh Bitcoin holdings would have dipped by 48 percent in the year since, with other currencies falling by the same amounts previously noted. Should\u2019ve listened to Larry.\n\nBoth those commercials debuted on Super Bowl night itself, but the advertisement offerings weren\u2019t limited to brand-new crypto endorsees. Chances are you also caught the reappearance of now-widely-mocked spots by Matt Damon, Tom Brady, and his now-ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen:\n\nMatt Damon\n\nOct. 28, 2021. Crypto.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummary: The digital currency exchange Crypto.com poured $100 million into its first global campaign in October, airing TV and digital commercials featuring Matt Damon as part of a \u201clong-term collaboration.\u201d The veteran actor became an investor in the company around then; in turn, Crypto.com gave $1 million to Damon\u2019s clean-water nonprofit and encouraged customers to make charitable donations in cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlogan: The centerpiece is meant to be \u201cFortune Favors the Brave,\u201d but I find the first line of the ad to be much more instructive: \u201cHistory is filled with \u2018almosts,\u2019 with those who almost adventured, who almost achieved, but ultimately, for them it proved to be too much.\u201d I can think of some modern-day parallels there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarket impact: By May 2022, as Stephen Witt reported, Crypto.com\u2019s user base had grown to 50 million users\u2014five times the number of users it had when the Damon ad first dropped. The commercial was perhaps too effective, to the point that, when the crypto market crashed in May and spurred Crypto.com into making significant layoffs, online commentators blamed Damon for encouraging people to invest in a bad market. Probably not what Damon or Crypto.com wanted from this partnership. These days, the exchange is shedding even more of its workers and changing its Canadian business model thanks to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the money: Let\u2019s assume the $1 million Crypto.com paid to Damon\u2019s nonprofit in October was all in Bitcoin. If that donation hadn\u2019t been converted to fiat, it would now be worth $358,953.12. Not good for the water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow boned are you? Bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped by 64 percent since that fortuitous fall. Hope you sold it off before that.\n\nWhat about other tokens?\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Ethereum: 1 ETH, worth $4,288.81 the day Damon\u2019s ad accosted the public, has slid by 65 percent.\n\n\u2022 Dogecoin: 1 DOGE was worth about a literal quarter back then. Now, you couldn\u2019t even trade it in for a dime.\n\n\u2022 Solana: SOL was experiencing an upswing around this time, climbing up to $194.80 by the time Damon came around. Now, it has cratered by about 89 percent(!).\n\nTom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen\n\nJune 29, 2021. FTX\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummary: Wow, remember when these two were still together? During those halcyon days, Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen took equity stakes in the crypto firm FTX and agreed to serve as ambassadors for the exchange. The then-couple went on to make multiple ads for the service, roping in other celebrities like Steph Curry. Neither disclosed their stakes in the firm at the time, although they received some amount of cryptocurrency for their trouble. Thanks to the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, we now know a lil bit more: Brady had 1.14 million common shares in the firm, valued at about $45 million total, while B\u00fcndchen carried 686,781, for $25 million. All together, about 1.8 million shares for $70 million. Wise investing(?).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlogan: \u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d (Yeah you are, buddy\u2014in deep doo-doo, that is!)\n\nMarket impact: About a month after Brady\u2019s announcement, FTX reached a valuation of $18 billion, and its revenues reportedly increased by 840 percent through 2021. Plus, the value of FTX\u2019s in-house token gradually climbed following the celebrity announcement, reaching its all-time peak of $78 around the time the September commercial was released. FTX also reached one of its highest peaks in trading volume the day the commercial dropped. Seems like that one paid off\u2014for FTX, at the time, that is. Now, as Brady and B\u00fcndchen face the same class-action lawsuit that\u2019s come for Larry David, it\u2019s likely their shares will totally evaporate. Assuming their holdings were in Bitcoin\u2014Brady\u2019s preferred currency\u2014that bonus is now worth 38 percent less than when Brady first received it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonus: In October, a fan was paid one (1) Bitcoin to return Brady\u2019s 600th touchdown football to him. That single coin, worth $62,266.30 then, is worth 65 percent less now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow boned are you? Going into July 2021, 1 BTC was worth even less than it was when Brady paid off that fan of his\u2014$33,541.99. So you can take comfort in the fact your fall wasn\u2019t as hard, at only 35 percent. Small mercies.\n\nWhat about other tokens?\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Ethereum: 1 ETH could be redeemed for about $2,000 at a time when Brady and B\u00fcndchen were happily together and shilling for FTX. But that coin is worth 24 percent less now.\n\n\u2022 Dogecoin: Still worth about an actual copper quarter at that point. Still worth much less than that by now.\n\n\u2022 Solana: SOL, something of an upstart currency in 2021, was only worth about $34 at that point. Still, the travails of the subsequent years shaved that value by 40 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the above four ads made up the entire spate of Super Bowl crypto promotions. That doesn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t instructive examples of celebrity-endorsed crypto shilling before that point, including:\n\nThe D\u2019Amelio Family\n\nMay 5, 2021. Gemini\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummary: For TikTok celebrity Charli D\u2019Amelio\u2019s 17th birthday, her family partnered with Gemini\u2014the crypto exchange founded by the Winkelvoss twins\u2014to gift Charli an undisclosed amount of Bitcoin.\n\nSlogan: \u201cWe are learning more about cryptocurrency as a family, thank you @gemini for Charli\u2019s birthday gift. #GeminiPartner.\u201d\n\nImpact: Difficult to ascertain. That month saw a major crypto crash that wiped out about $1 trillion from the overall market, thanks in large part to China\u2019s announcement of a ban on Bitcoin mining. So both Bitcoin and Gemini\u2019s in-house token lost out. Still, Gemini overall seemed to have a good year from that moment onward, stating on May 11 that it was holding more than $30 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Just months later, Forbes wrote that \u201cGemini is growing fast and aggressively hiring.\u201d So maybe this celebrity partnership helped get Gemini some good PR and business, at least until the Securities and Exchange Commission recently came a-knockin\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow boned are you? Since Charli\u2019s dad had previously tweeted that she wanted \u201ca Bitcoin\u201d for her present, let\u2019s say for this exercise that she (and you) received 1 BTC at that moment. On May 6, 2021, the value of one Bitcoin was $56,430.21. That coin has shed 61 percent of its value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat about other tokens?\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Ethereum: ETH was surging upward when Charli logged on, trading at about $3,450. It\u2019s down now by about 56 percent.\n\n\u2022 Dogecoin: May 2021 was a flush time for DOGE at about 55 cents. Two whole quarters and a nickel!\n\n\u2022 Solana: Still low, at about $45. That\u2019s been cut by 55 percent.\n\nSpike Lee\n\nJuly 14, 2021. Coin Cloud\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummary: Spike Lee\u2019s second-most-controversial project in 2021 was an ad he directed and starred in for Coin Cloud, a currency service that provides ATMs through which users can purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Tether, and other digital coins. The message: The old money system is discriminatory against Americans who are not white men, but the \u201cdigital rebellion\u201d in cryptocurrency will lead to liberation for all. (About that \u2026 )\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto newcomers can obtain up to $500 worth of Bitcoin from Coin Cloud\u2019s ATMs just by providing their phone number, so let\u2019s assume that\u2019s the amount Lee got from doing the commercial. The value of a Bitcoin today is about 32 percent lower than when Lee did this ad, reducing the value of his ATM paycheck to $340.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlogan: \u201cDo Your Own Research. (The risks of trading or holding can be substantial and the value can go up or down quickly and dramatically.)\u201d\n\nMarket impact: As New York magazine reported, Coin Cloud had no ATMs in New York City when Spike Lee filmed his ad there; the machines seen in the video are props. Per Coin Cloud\u2019s own website, it \u2026 still has no ATMs in Lee\u2019s home state. Oh, and the company filed for bankruptcy this week.\n\nHow boned are you? Bitcoin\u2014which is accurately depicted in the commercial as having been valued around $33,000 at the time\u2014kept plunging in value throughout July until it began a steady recovery near the end of the month. Overall, it\u2019s still down by 32 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat about other tokens?\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Ethereum: Worth about $2,400 then, down by 37 percent now.\n\n\u2022 Dogecoin: Sadly, by June 1 DOGE couldn\u2019t even be traded for two dimes, forget a quarter.\n\n\u2022 Solana: $31.36 if you found a Coin Cloud ATM right after the ad aired. Hey, at least Solana\u2019s only lower by about $10 from that point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what about what came after the Super Bowl? After all, just three months later, the entire crypto market experienced one of its most crippling downturns to date, throwing the industry into chaos. The valuations of Bitcoin and several popular \u201caltcoins\u201d plummeted, thanks in large part to ripple effects from interest rate hikes, and Coinbase just narrowly avoided bankruptcy. It didn\u2019t get better after that: Coinbase, Crypto.com, and eToro all made steep staff cuts that summer, a trend that accelerated after FTX fully imploded in November. Crypto ad budgets were naturally curtailed as well, with industrywide spending bottoming out by July (and hitting other tech and media companies\u2019 pocketbooks in the process). Still, up through the eve of that still-lingering crash, a few more celebrities made some, uh, pitches:\n\nNaomi Osaka\n\nMarch 21, 2022. FTX\n\nIf @StephenCurry30 @TomBrady and @giseleofficial are in then you know I am too! Excited for the journey ahead with @FTX_Official and SBF_FTX \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/ydrjhoKPaL \u2014 NaomiOsaka\u5927\u5742\u306a\u304a\u307f (@naomiosaka) March 21, 2022\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummary: Hey, you can\u2019t say crypto fans always lack self-awareness: This commercial features an advertising brain trust figuring out various possible themes for an ad featuring Naomi Osaka. Comics, the moon, and dragons all come up, yet the room settles for Osaka simply announcing her FTX partnership on TV. The ad came as part of FTX\u2019s push to bring more women and young investors into crypto; the tennis star in turn received an undisclosed equity stake and cryptocurrency compensation (in a \u201clong-term\u201d contract), an FTX donation to her Play Foundation, and special FTX-branded gear for her games.\n\nSlogan: \u201cIf @StephenCurry30 @TomBrady and @giseleofficial are in then you know I am too!\u201d\n\nHow boned are you? Supposing Osaka (or you) had been compensated in Bitcoin, that stash would be worth about 47 percent less now, with 1 BTC costing $41,034.06 the day of her announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat about other tokens?\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Ethereum: 1 ETH went for nearly $3,000 then, which means its value has been slashed by half.\n\n\u2022 Dogecoin: 12 cents of value! So you didn\u2019t lose much.\n\n\u2022 Solana: 1 SOL was $88.74, meaning it\u2019s lost more than 75 percent of its price.\n\nSteph Curry\n\nMarch 29, 2022. FTX\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummary: This commercial is meant to assure hesitant FTX adopters of the accessibility of its service. You see, Steph Curry keeps denying to Shaq\u2014who\u2019s narrating off screen\u2014that he has any expertise on crypto. However, FTX\u2019s app makes it all so easy for him! What could go wrong? (Besides the hideous Bored Ape ice sculpture you see Curry carving in front of a house.) This followed a deal the Golden State superstar had signed with FTX back in September, earning himself\u2014you guessed it\u2014an undisclosed equity stake.\n\nSlogan: \u201cI\u2019m not an expert, and I don\u2019t need to be.\u201d\n\nMarket impact: When famed Bitcoin maxi Michael Saylor offered crypto advice to Curry in September 2021, he claimed to have bought $3 million in BTC\u2014which would now be worth only $1.41 million. This fact may not faze Curry too much, considering he\u2019s long been familiar with sharp crypto plunges. But the class-action lawsuit, which includes Curry along with Brady and David and Osaka, could be a source of worry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow boned are you? Now, if you had bought $3 million in Bitcoin when Curry told you to in March, it\u2019d only be worth $1.52 million now. Sorry about the lost milli.\n\nWhat about other tokens?\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Ethereum: 1 ETH was $3,402.95 then, and is now worth about 55 percent less.\n\n\u2022 Dogecoin: 14 cents, just 6 cents more than what 1 DOGE has now.\n\n\u2022 Solana: 1 SOL was $111.69, but it\u2019s only worth about 18 percent of that value now.\n\nJoel Embiid\n\nMay 6, 2022. Crypto.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummary: NBA star Joel Embiid walks through city streets, with his old college coach Bill Self narrating an inspirational tale of the unconventional path Embiid took to stardom, as well as the adversity he faced along the way. Obviously, a Cameroonian immigrant coming to the U.S. to pursue pro basketball is uhh right in line with \u2026 being brave by trading with Crypto.com? Interestingly, just a couple months before this, Embiid told the Athletic that he\u2019s \u201cnot big on\u201d crypto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlogan: \u201cWe keep going, until our path is the one they wish they\u2019d taken.\u201d\n\nMarket impact: Crypto.com saw a significant uptick in trading volume in the days following the ad. However, just a week after that came the downfall of the entire crypto market, from which the exchange\u2019s volume has still not recovered. Oh well, gotta trust the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow boned are you? Ironically, this could be a relief, seeing as BTC was already ticking downward last May, sitting at about $36,000. So, uh, that\u2019s only worth about 40 percent less nowadays.\n\nWhat about other tokens?\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Ethereum: ETH was also sliding at this point, sinking down to $2,600 when Embiid took to the cameras. The currency is worth even less now, of course, by about 41 percent.\n\n\u2022 Dogecoin: This was right when DOGE began to plummet from about 12 cents to the 8-cent average it\u2019s maintained. Welp.\n\n\u2022 Solana: About 75 percent higher than what it\u2019s valued at today.
