        "content": "Digital assets manager CoinShares says institutional crypto products saw heavy inflows across the board last week for the eighth consecutive week.\n\nIn its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares finds that institutional investors are continuing to up their allocations to crypto with Solana (SOL) investment products leading the way for altcoins.\n\n\u201cDigital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US $176 million last week in a continuation of consecutive weekly inflows that has now lasted 8 weeks, bringing year-to-date inflows to US $1.32 billion.\u201d\n\nCoinShares also puts the yearly inflows into perspective, comparing inflows to previous years.\n\n\u201cHowever, the inflows remain well behind 2021 and 2020, which saw US $10.7 billion and US $6.6 billion respectively.\u201d\n\nAccording to CoinShares, much of the trading volume surge in crypto can be traced to exchange-traded product (ETP) investors.\n\n\u201cTrading volumes in ETPs have averaged US $3 billion per week, double this year\u2019s average of US $1.5 billion. Interestingly, ETP share of total crypto volumes is rising, averaging 11% compared to the long-term historical average of 3.4%, and well above the averages seen in the 2020/21 bull market.\u201d\n\nKing crypto Bitcoin (BTC) led the way with $154.7 million of inflows. Solana products raked in $13.6 million as interest in the Ethereum (ETH) competitor continues to grow. Ethereum enjoyed $3.3 million in inflows, while Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA) and XRP products brought in less than a million apiece.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "BONK rallies as Solana\u2019s founder talks meme coin utility - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Following SOL\u2019s direction, the prices of BONK and other meme coins increased.\n\nThe Solana founder brought up a discussion that could drive use cases.\n\nThe value of Bonk [BONK], a meme built on the Solana [SOL] blockchain, has increased by 29.87%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At press time, BONK\u2019s price was $0.0000043, indicating one of the highest climbs it had in the last 30 days.\n\nIts 24-hour trading volume also increased by 100%, jumping to $104 million in the process.\n\nBONK\u2019s tremendous increase is just one out of the many Solana-themed meme coins. AMBCrypto, evaluating data from Birdye.so, found out that cryptocurrencies like Myro [MYRO] have also had a similar performance.\n\nUse cases for the likes of BONK?\n\nOthers including GUAC, Pepecoin [PEPE], and ROCK also followed BONK\u2019s trend. One of the reasons the price of these memes was because of SOL.\n\nFor a token that has increased by 126% in the last 30 days, it was only expected that the market passed that confidence on to tokens developed using the blockchain.\n\nSolana\u2019s founder Anatoly Yakovenko also seemed to be watching the events unfold. Due to this, Yakovenko took time to engage publicly about the memes. What captured the founder\u2019s attention was the comment of Chris Burniske, the former crypto lead at ARK Invest.\n\nDo you think meme coins are always going to be just memes (totally fine outcome)? Or do you think it\u2019s possible to build a global movement based on emissions rewarding people for some \u201cmissionary\u201d work? \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) November 20, 2023\n\nBurniske has praised the ecosystem for ensuring that all Solana players are enjoying the rewards of the project\u2019s recovery.\n\nHe did this using BONK as an example. In response, Yakovenko asked if it was possible to build a utility for meme coins. He also inquired if rewards could be used to get the community behind the objective.\n\nBurniske answered, saying that it was possible. However, he noted that the major objective would be to ensure fair distribution.\n\nHe posted:\n\n\u201cIf done right, crypto will more closely align valuable labor with the capital it helps create \u2014 so while meme coins are fun, I\u2019m focused on making the latter camp you mention a reality. It would be an important update to Capitalism, ultimately better-distributing capital.\u201d\n\nSolana meme season still\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of BONK\u2019s social volume showed that the metric reached its highest point all year long on the 19th of November. This metric measures the number of search terms connected to a project.\n\nIf the social volume decreases, it means the market interest in a token has decreased. However, a jump in the social volume indicates rising interest in trading a cryptocurrency. The latter was the case with BONK.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BONKs worth today?\n\nIn spite of the fact that the reading had fallen, there were still eyes looking out for BONK. As it stands, there is a likelihood that BONK\u2019s price will drop.\n\nThis projection was because market players may deem it fit to take profits. However, if Solana\u2019s price recovers, BONK, and other memes may also follow."

        "title": "A spicy salvo launched in the monolithic vs modular debate - Blockworks",
        "content": "As blockchains scale, the cost of transactions and blockspace falls. The 2022-2023 bear market has been characterized by a continuous build out of infrastructure, to lay the groundwork for future growth.\n\nYet arguments about the best way to scale abound, they often fall into one of two camps.\n\nOne is \u201cmodular,\u201d with its standard-bearers Ethereum and Cosmos. The other is \u201cmonolithic\u201d which has come to be dominated in the crypto zeitgeist by Solana \u2014 although they prefer the term \u201cintegrated.\u201d\n\nAn essay published Friday by pseudonymous Ethereum advocate Polynya critiquing monolithic blockchains, while not mentioning it by name, has been interpreted by many as a veiled critique of Solana.\n\nThe critique comes against a backdrop of swelling interest in the network spurred by a significant price surge in Solana\u2019s native crypto asset (SOL), which is up 140% in the past month with a market cap approaching $25 billion\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhile often praised for its high transaction speed and low fees, Solana has faced criticism in the past for network instability, including outright outages, and high hardware requirements to operate validating nodes\u200b\u200b.\n\nResponding to perceived shortcomings, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, has acknowledged some network flaws, but contends the Solana community has worked diligently to mitigate them.\n\nYakovenko views these challenges as part of the network\u2019s growth, likening them to historical issues faced by other major networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nPlans include the mid-2024 launch of Firedancer, the first independent validator client software for Solana (Ethereum has 5), which is expected to increase throughput to as much as a million transactions per second (TPS) in the future.\n\nYakovenko, responding to Polynya\u2019s specific critique, argued the natural growth in computing power coupled with falling costs as hardware becomes commoditized will handle Solana\u2019s needs with aplomb.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nPolynya\u2019s essay also advocates for advanced technologies like validity proofs and data availability sampling to address scaling demands, predicting \u201cevery single monolithic blockchain seeking scale will upgrade to tech like validity proofs and data availability sampling or be risk [obsolescence].\u201d\n\nSolana developer Mert Mumtaz, CEO at Helius and co-host of Blockworks\u2019 Lightspeed podcast, responded that Solana could embrace both vertical and horizontal scaling.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nPolynya further lamented the crypto industry\u2019s disproportionate focus on infrastructure over user onboarding \u2014 and a dearth of applications with product-market fit \u2014 which Mumtaz derided as the pot calling the kettle black.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIn response to criticism, Polynya published an addendum post on Sunday in which they acknowledge the tone of the original essay was a bit harsh, but noted \u201ccontent only gets attention in crypto if it\u2019s provocative.\u201d\n\nMonolithic chains that integrate modular components, such as validity proofs and data availability sampling, would be a welcome change, Polynya argues, suggesting they would no longer be \u201cmonolithic\u201d because \u201cper my definition you no longer need all nodes to na\u00efvely reprocess all transactions to verify integrity.\u201d\n\nEndgame\n\nUltimately, this dispute revolves around the question of what is the modus operandi of using a blockchain?\n\n\u201cThe whole point of a public blockchain is lost if you are not resistant for the worst-case scenarios,\u201d Polynya wrote. \u201c[10,000 nodes] is not enough, and we should strive to have 100,000 nodes in different types of places across the world. We need nodes at homes, schools, government offices \u2014 in large cities, in villages, in Chile, in Papua New Guinea, and eventually in space.\u201d\n\nSolana currently has between 2,000 and 3,000 nodes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine to have a monolithic blockchain today, the technology to push past its crippling limitations did not exist 5 years ago,\u201d Polynya concludes, with the caveat that the industry will \u201cinevitably converge\u201d on a design using validity proofs and data availability sampling.\n\n\u201cThis is the only currently known way for the blockchain world to achieve our endgame of global scale, all verified on our mobile phones.\u201d\n\nPolynya further warns against continued \u201cPonzifying\u201d of dapps. \u201cAs an industry, collectively, we must invest in consolidating our existing applications which have product-market fit, before traditional incumbents catch up and take away market share,\u201d they said in Sunday\u2019s denouement.\n\nUpdated, Nov. 20, 2023 at 9:52 am ET, with additional context.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
