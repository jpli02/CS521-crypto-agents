        "content": "STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN, March 25, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solanaland, a pioneer in Solana-based cryptocurrency launches, is excited to announce the upcoming presale of $SLAND, its very own utility token. As Solana continues to dominate the DeFi space with its fast transaction speeds and low fees, Solanaland brings everything users to love about pinksale to the Solana network.\n\n\"We're thrilled to be soon launching our utility token on Pink Sale,\" said a spokesperson for Solanaland. \"We're creating an all-in-one ecosystem for Solana token launches, and we believe our platform will enable users to unlock the potential of low-cap tokens. Our launchpad is perfect for degens looking to explore new opportunities in the DeFi space.\"\n\nSolanaland's all-in-one ecosystem for Solana token launches will enable users to mint SPL tokens, create a launchpad, lock liquidity, list on DEXes such as Raydium and Orca, send airdrops, undergo KYC and audits. Solanaland's launchpad will be perfect for degens looking to explore the possibilities of low-cap tokens with high potential for returns.\n\nWith Solanaland, creating SPL tokens takes only a few minutes, allowing users to get started quickly. The launchpad enables users to raise initial liquidity and start trading. The platform's price tool, DEXGecko, tracks tokens and offers traders real-time price action, recent trades, trading volume, charts, technical analysis, and swap tokens.\n\nSolanaland's $SLAND token is the utility token of the ecosystem, and users will need it to pay for service fees such as token minting, running an airdrop, and creating a launchpad. As the presale commences, users can purchase $SLAND tokens at an exclusive discount rate.\n\nDevelopers at Solanaland have put in measures to protect traders from rug pulls by locking liquidity on the launchpad. Tokens that are sold during the presale will be automatically listed on Raydium and Orca. Users can also easily send token airdrops to thousands of addresses within minutes using the airdrop dAPP.\n\nSolanaland's presale of the $SLAND token is set to open soon on Pink Sale, the leading platform for decentralized fundraising. To participate in the presale, users will need to connect their Solana wallet to the platform and purchase tokens.\n\nThe upcoming launch of Solanaland's $SLAND presale demonstrates the company's commitment to providing an innovative, all-in-one ecosystem for Solana-based cryptocurrency launches aimed at providing users with a seamless experience and unlocking the potential of low-cap tokens.\n\nAs the presale commences, users can stay updated with the latest developments at: https://solanaland.so and by following the project on Twitter(@slandofficial) and Telegram(@slandofficial) accounts.\n\nAbout the Company:\n\nSolanaland is a Solana-based cryptocurrency platform that provides an all-in-one ecosystem for Solana token launches.

        "content": "A top crypto analyst is mapping the path forward for four crypto assets that have witnessed bullish price action in the last seven days.\n\nIn a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cred tells his 49,200 YouTube subscribers that XRP could witness bullish continuation as long as it is above the previous resistance at $0.414.\n\n\u201cIf this breakout sticks and XRP does its sort of trend wiping candles where it just moons and sort of retraces weeks and weeks and weeks of selling in a much smaller number of weeks, if that is the case, I think the bigger magnet if you will, or the clearer level for price is about $0.50 to $0.60.\u201d\n\nXRP, which is up by nearly 10% in the past week, is trading at $0.425 at time of writing.\n\nNext up is smart contract protocol Cardano (ADA). Cred says the seventh largest crypto asset by market cap is \u201crespecting technicals\u201d and could revisit its 2023 high of $0.42, which it hit in February.\n\n\u201cI think as long as you\u2019re not getting daily acceptance below sort of $0.35 and this more recent flip level [of around $0.35]\u2026 I think if this reclaims sticks, the next high timeframe trouble area is this big support resistance flip range high thing at around $0.41.That makes sense to me.\n\nAnd then if that breaks, we can just carve out a range of this thing with $0.40, $0.60-ish and $0.50 is the mid. But I think in the short term, we have pretty clear trading levels between $0.35 and $0.42-ish\u201d\n\nCardano is trading at $0.361 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Solana (SOL), the pseudonymous analyst says that the 12th-largest crypto by market cap is forming a double bottom pattern after managing to hold support at $20 According to Cred, Solana is still range bound with support at $20, range midpoint at $23 and resistance at $26.\n\n\u201cWe essentially have a double bottom forming just above a high timeframe level of support [at $20]\u2026\n\nSort of range low reclaim as long as you don\u2019t get daily closes back below $20 \u2013 $21. That looks like it\u2019s trading back within the range.\n\nWhen markets do that, we like to look at the mid and the other side of the range, which I think for this [Solana daily timeframe] chart would be something akin to $22 is the range midpoint, $24-ish is the range high.\n\nYou could be a bit more charitable and use something closer to the extremities, the sort of same range local at around $20 and then the $26 range high, giving you a $23, $24 mid.\u201d\n\nSolana is worth $20.89 at time of writing.\n\nThe last coin on the trader\u2019s radar is Ethereum (ETH) rival Fantom (FTM). According to Cred, FTM looks bullish provided it stays above its previous resistance at $0.43.\n\n\u201cAs long as that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019d expect the high [around $0.65] to be traded and then the next big trouble area, if we get a really meaty rotation, is the former range high at like $0.70 to $0.90.\u201d\n\nFantom is trading at $0.46 at time of writing. A move toward the upper bounds of the analyst\u2019s target suggests a rally of over 90% for the Ethereum competitor.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
