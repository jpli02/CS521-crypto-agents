        "content": "Solana\u2019s (SOL) price witnessed significant declines over the past week after registering consistent gains in December.\n\nSOL is down by 4.5% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $90.7 at the time of writing. The asset\u2019s market cap fell to $39.2 billion, creating a $6 billion gap with the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, BNB.\n\nSOL price, open interest, funding rate and RSI \u2013 Jan. 8 | Source: Santiment\n\nHowever, Solana\u2019s daily trading volume recorded a 39% surge, reaching $2.9 billion.\n\nAccording to data provided by Santiment, the Solana Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently hovering around the 35 mark. Per the data provider, the asset\u2019s RSI has been constantly falling over the past week \u2014 SOL\u2019s RSI was 73 on Jan. 2.\n\nYou might also like: Scammers impersonate crypto journalists with malicious Calendly links on X\n\nThis indicator shows that Solana could face a notable rally as there is less selling pressure than when the asset was trading at around $110 last week.\n\nSolana\u2019s RSI would need to stay below the 50 mark to record a price rally.\n\nMoreover, data from Santiment shows that the total open interest (OI) in SOL declined from $1.3 billion on Jan. 1 to roughly $880 million at the reporting time.\n\nThe total funding rates aggregated by Solana is currently standing at 0.008% \u2014 recording a 90% drop over the past seven days. This shows that long-position holders have a slight dominance over short-position holders until further movements.\n\nThe declining OI suggests that investors have either faced strong liquidations or closed their trading positions with Solana\u2019s decline below the $100 mark."

        "content": "SOL\n\nThis development occurs simultaneously with Solana's native token, SOL, plummeting more than 13% in the last seven days.\n\nThe popularity for meme coins thriving on the Solana network has witnessed a notable decline over the past few weeks.\n\nAmong the affected coins, BONK, once in the spotlight, has recently encountered a significant downturn. The token experienced a 65% decline over the past three weeks, with an additional 22% drop in the last week alone.\n\nBONK 7-Day Price Chart (Source: CoinMarketCap)\n\nAnother victim of the waning enthusiasm is Dogwifhat (WIF), which captured attention with its canine-themed aesthetic. Even though the token generated hype and provided early holders with a 10,000% return on capital, it is now down nearly 75% from all-time high (ATH). WIF lost more than 54% over the last deven days, and trading at 0.07693, as of writing.\n\nEven established meme coins like Samoyedcoin have not been immune to the downturn, witnessing a more than 60% fall in three weeks and currently trading at $0.01135 with a market cap of $40.8 million.\n\nCHIPI and POPCAT, both themed around cats, have seen over 90% declines since their lifetime peaks. The broader decline in the meme coin sector highlights a shift in sentiment even among long-standing tokens.\n\n\u200d\n\nSolana's Rise and Fall\n\nSolana's ecosystem saw a surge in December, with bonk tokens soaring over 1,000% over a period of weeks. This success led to listings on major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase, amplifying Solana's prominence. However, recent market dynamics indicate a reversal, with memecoin values plummeting.\n\nWhile meme coins took a hit, Solana emerged as the number one on-chain coin on a seven-day rolling basis, surpassing Ethereum in both trading volumes and network fees.\n\nAmid these developments, Solana's native token, SOL, faced a significant setback, experiencing a more than 13% decline in the last seven days, and more than 25% fall in three weeks."

        "content": "Amid what has been a rather volatile start to the year for digital assets across the board, one analyst has projected that Solana (SOL) could be prepping a 50x surge in 2024. Indeed, the often labeled \u201cEthereum killer\u201d could be following the same trajectory that led ETH to earn 50x returns in 2018.\n\nThe asset saw a positive end to 2023 and could be preparing to go on an extended rally. Moreover, many have observed the potential for the asset to even surpass Ethereum. Especially if it can mirror the bull run that propelled ETH. Still, some obstacles may hinder an eventual rally; let\u2019s explore more of what those could be.\n\nSource: Observatorio Blockchain\n\nAlso Read: Solana: Will SOL Reclaim its All-Time High of $259 in 2024?\n\nSolana Could Mirror Ethereum 2018 Run to REach 50x Gains in 2024\n\nThe optimism for Solana has been immensely high as we are just one week into the new year. Along with the overall crypto market, there are high expectations on how several assets could perform throughout the year. Moreover, one analyst has pointed to the Ethereum killer for its immense potential.\n\nIndeed, analyst Raoul Pal believes that Solana (SOL) could be poised for a 50x surge in 2024. Moreover, he notes that the asset could parallel the 2018 surge that propelled Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum to new heights. Additionally, traders are preparing for renewed funds to enter into the ecosystem as the year progresses.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Holds Steady Above $100; Will SOL Hit $130 Soon?\n\n\u201cSo I just flip up the chart of ETH in 2018, and then put it against the chart of Solana,\u201d Pal said. \u201cThey are pretty much identical. ETH did 47x from that low.\u201d Subsequently, Solana could begin to flourish as an Ethereum alternative. Its closed system, passionate community, and lower gas fees have already created stiff competition between the two.\n\nConversely, some believe inflation of the SOL token could hinder any sort of rally. When SOL reached its previous all-time high in 2021, it had a market cap of more than $75 billion. Now, it would require a market cap of $111 billion in order to reach a new all-time high above $260. Although not impossible, it certainly begins to hinder expectations for the asset ceiling throughout 2024."

        "content": "Riding the Shift from Ethereum to Solana in the NFT World\n\nIn the dynamic realm of NFTs, artists are often confronted with the challenge of finding the right platform to showcase their work. While Ethereum (ETH) has long been a dominant force in the NFT space, recent trends indicate a shift in energy and excitement towards alternative blockchains like Solana. This shift underscores a crucial message for artists: adaptability is key, and venturing into new territories can be a game-changer.\n\nThe Rise of Solana: A Beacon for NFT Artists\n\nThe past few months have seen a substantial increase in collector activity on platforms like @exchgART, particularly within the Solana ecosystem. This uptick is more than just a fleeting trend; it represents a significant movement of collectors exploring alternatives to Ethereum. Solana\u2019s appeal lies in its cost-effectiveness and faster transaction times, making it an attractive option for both artists and collectors. As the NFT landscape evolves, Solana is quickly becoming a hub of innovation and engagement.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Challenges: A Call for Diversification\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s pioneering role in the NFT space, it faces challenges that can be daunting for emerging artists. High gas fees and a highly competitive environment, coupled with a currently lower collector base, make it difficult for new entrants to gain traction. This situation necessitates a strategic pivot, encouraging artists to explore other blockchain ecosystems where opportunities are burgeoning.\n\nEmbracing Change: The Importance of Exploring New Frontiers\n\nThe key takeaway for artists is clear: to stay relevant and successful in the NFT market, one must go where the people \u2013 and in this case, the collectors \u2013 are heading. Solana, with its growing collector base and artist-friendly environment, presents a compelling alternative. But the exploration shouldn\u2019t stop there. The NFT world is vast, with numerous other blockchains offering unique opportunities. Artists must remain agile, continually seeking new ideas, wallets, chains, and communities to engage with.\n\nTLDR: As the NFT landscape shifts, with excitement and energy moving from Ethereum to Solana, artists must embrace this change to thrive. Exploring Solana and other blockchains is not just an option but a necessity for artists seeking growth and engagement in the evolving NFT market."

        "content": "MangoFarmSOL, a Solana-based yield farming protocol, is suspected to have rug pulled after abruptly shutting down its social media presence and restricting access to its Telegram channel. Prior to the shutdown on January 6th, pseudonymous developer Foobar, who had recently been assigned to audit MangoFarmSOL\u2019s security, warned that the front-end had been compromised.\n\nKeypoints\n\nMangoFarmSOL\u2019s social media accounts and website were abruptly deactivated after funds were reported missing from the protocol\n\nUsers suspect a rug pull as the Telegram channel was restricted and estimated losses are around $2 million\n\nThe pseudonymous developer Foobar had recently been appointed as a security auditor and warned that the front-end was compromised\n\nScreenshots circulated showing the developer claiming he was forced to create Ponzi schemes and suggesting involvement with another project BananaMiner\n\nRepresentatives from BananaMiner denied any connection to MangoFarmSOL, though admitted they were approached for collaboration\n\nLosses from the apparent exit scam are estimated around $2 million. The allegations surface just days before MangoFarmSOL\u2019s planned airdrop of its MANGO governance token on January 10th, which required users deposit Solana tokens to qualify.\n\nmangofarm frontend compromised, don\u2019t use \u2014 foobar (@0xfoobar) January 6, 2024\n\nScreenshots circulated on social media showing messages allegedly from the developer behind MangoFarmSOL claiming they were forced to create \u201cPonzi schemes\u201d and suggesting involvement with another project, BananaMiner. However, representatives from BananaMiner strongly denied any association, though admitted they had been approached by MangoFarmSOL about potential collaboration but declined due to a conflict of interest.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MomoBigIcy/status/1743757822070751239\n\nThe abrupt shutdown of MangoFarmSOL\u2019s online presence and restricting of its Telegram channel to new members has fueled suspicions of an exit scam, also known as a \u201crug pull,\u201d whereby developers make off with investor funds. The DeFi space is rife with such scams preying on the get-rich-quick dreams of crypto investors.\n\nHowever, the developer\u2019s messages alluding to being forced to create Ponzi schemes suggest potential coercion from scammers lurking in the shadows. The solicitations between legit DeFi protocols and potential scam projects highlight the need for enhanced security and due diligence.\n\nMangoFarmSOL\u2019s rug pull contributes to the increasing attacks on Solana\u2019s budding DeFi ecosystem. According to blockchain security firm Chainalysis, underground communities dedicated to stealing crypto funds using Solana wallet drainers have amassed thousands of members.\n\nThe Solana community continues working to secure the network and educate investors to avoid falling prey. The ecosystem shows strong growth and adoption despite the fraudsters seeking to exploit it. With milestones surpassing Ethereum in stablecoin volume and NFT sales, Solana maintains its trajectory to becoming a top blockchain as it celebrates its achievements alongside its afflictions."
