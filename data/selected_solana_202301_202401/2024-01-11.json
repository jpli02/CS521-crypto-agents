        "title": "Solana Saga's Lucrative NFT Airdrops Outshine Smartphone's Initial Cost - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Around mid-December 2023, sales of the Solana Mobile Saga smartphone saw a remarkable increase, primarily fueled by the excitement within the cryptocurrency community. This spike in sales was attributed to the realization that owning a Saga phone could be financially advantageous. Each Saga phone purchaser was eligible to receive an airdrop of 30 million Bonk (BONK) tokens. With the token\u2019s recent rise in value, this meant that buyers could potentially gain approximately $1,000 in BONK tokens from an investment of $599 for the phone.\n\nOn December 16, 2023, during this intense sales period, Solana Mobile took to social media platform X to announce that the Saga smartphone was entirely out of stock. The company expressed deep appreciation for the community\u2019s support and conveyed their excitement about the future, highlighting this event as a significant milestone.\n\nThe Saga is SOLD OUT!\n\n\n\nWords cannot describe how much we appreciate your support. We are nothing without this amazing community \ud83e\udec2\n\n\n\nWhile these past few days will be cemented in our history, we\u2019re excited for the future \ud83e\udee1\n\n\n\nStay tuned \u2728 pic.twitter.com/KJje8lBDLL \u2014 Solana Mobile \ud83c\udf31 (@solanamobile) December 16, 2023\n\nHowever, the BONK airdrop, which is currently worth around $463, was not the only valuable gift received by Saga owners. First, we had the 100,000 ACS airdrop by Access Protocol, and most recently, a new NFT project called Saga Monkes launched, which airdropped 8,505 unique NFTs to Solana Saga owners based on a snapshot taken on 2 January 2024. Naturally, those who received and activated their phones are not too happy, but the team behind this project is promising that there will be another airdrop in the future.\n\nWe understand the frustration of \"missing out\" \u2013 please understand there was a large increase in saga activations within a 48 hour period. 2000+ just between finalizing mint and initializing airdrop. But hey, welcome to being an adult. \ud83d\udc35 pic.twitter.com/PkOiGoJkZ1 \u2014 saga monkes (@sagamonkes) January 7, 2024\n\nThe demand for Saga Monkes NFTs surged quickly. By late Tuesday, these Solana NFTs were listed on secondary marketplaces with starting prices of around $1,250 in SOL value. This price point is more than double the Saga smartphone\u2019s last selling price of $599 before selling out in December. At the time of writing, according to data from NFT marketplace Magic Eden, the floor price for Saga Monkes NFTs is 8.119 SOL (i.e. approximately $811)."

        "content": "The Solana on-chain transaction volume exploded in December, as the SOL, the native token, punched through various price levels in the month. SOL continued this price growth into early January but has since declined to shed some of its gains.\n\nOn the other hand, on-chain data has revealed a consistent increase in the transaction volume on the blockchain, with volumes exploding by over 700% in the last 30 days.\n\nSolana Transaction Volumes Surge\n\nAccording to data from various analytics platforms, transaction volumes on the Solana blockchain have surged to show how SOL\u2019s popularity has increased. Transaction volume data from The Block shows the value moved on the Solana chain daily has been on a steady growth since the first week of December 2023 and continued into the first week of January 2024 to reach its highest level since December 2022.\n\nThe latest metrics reveal that the daily transaction volume which measures the throughput of SOL and tokens like USDC, SRM, RAY, and USDT on the Solana blockchain recently hit $42.72 billion on January 3, representing more than 700% of the daily volume of $5.47 billion recorded on December 3.\n\nSource: The Block\n\nAt the same time, on-chain data has revealed that Solana is increasingly becoming the preferred chain for stablecoin usage and transactions. As a result, Solana has flipped Ethereum in weekly stablecoin trading volume.\n\nAt the same time, The Block\u2019s data dashboard shows a December transaction volume of $426.87 billion SOL moved on the Solana chain compared to $97.82 billion worth of ETH on the Ethereum chain. The Solana chain also witnessed $296.26 billion USDC volume and $10.95 billion USDT in December.\n\nAt the time of writing, January\u2019s monthly volume now stands at $60.58 billion SOL and $60.87 billion USDC.\n\nSource: The Block\n\nSOL Price To $200?\n\nApart from the spike in the interest in the native SOL token, the increase in value moved on the Solana can also be attributed to interest in SOL-based meme coins. For instance, BONK, Solana\u2019s first meme coin, witnessed significant trading volume that pushed its price to a new all-time high. MYRO, another SOL-based meme coin, is currently making impressive gains with its price doing a 169% return in the past seven days.\n\nIn terms of price action, SOL is currently on a decline as part of a general decline among altcoins. This has led to SOL\u2019s price dropping 11.6% in the past seven days and is now trading at $90. The next support is at the $87 price level, and a break below could lead to a continued price decline in the short term.\n\nHowever, SOL still shows promise in the longer term, as the monthly and daily transaction volume points to sustained interest in the chain. If this trend continues and the sentiment among altcoins flips bullish, we could see Solana price growth pick back where it left off and go to new highs.\n\nThe first resistance to overcome is close at the $97 price level before other resistances at $109, $115, and $125.\n\nSOL price falls to $90 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from YouTube, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "Solana's memecoin mania is over. But an upcoming airdrop could bring it back - DLNews",
        "content": "The memecoin mania that encapsulated Solana traders for the last two months appears to be subsiding.\n\nAn upcoming Solana airdrop may be bigger than both the Pyth and Jito airdrops combined.\n\nDespite the decline, some of Solana\u2019s metrics have improved.\n\nActivity metrics on Solana are returning to earth after an end-of-year surge saw trading volume briefly surpass that of Ethereum, but a new airdrop could reignite the buzz around the blockchain.\n\nMemecoins, tokens without any function or use case that trade solely on their popularity and sentiment, drove much of the December boom.\n\nMetrics from Solana data platform Solscan show that memecoin trading appears to be subsiding. The number of newly minted tokens on Solana has dropped over 65% from its December 27 high, while decentralised exchange volumes dropped 18% over the past week.\n\nAt the same time, popular Solana memecoins, such as BONK, have dropped more than 60% from their all-time highs.\n\nBONK has retraced much of its gains over the past month.\n\nAirdrops on Solana from Pyth and Jito preceded the surge of activity that occurred late last year.\n\nIf the same trend holds, there is good reason to believe that an upcoming airdrop from decentralised exchange aggregator Jupiter could spark another increase in trading activity.\n\nSolana activity plummets after Christmas boom\n\nA lack of activity on Solana amid crypto winter meant that newly-created tokens were non-existent for much of 2023. But after the Pyth and Jito airdrops injected an estimated $290 million into the Solana ecosystem, token creation accelerated to new all-time highs.\n\nThese highs proved short-lived. Just two weeks later, the number of daily newly-created tokens fell over 67% from a high of 7,918 to just over 2,600.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nDaily newly-created tokens on Solana. (Solscan)\n\nDecentralised exchange \u2014 or DEX \u2014 volumes have suffered a similar decline.\n\nIn December, Solana surpassed Ethereum in total DEX volume for the first time on December 14, and again from December 20 to 25. Today, Solana DEX volumes have fallen back behind Ethereum.\n\nMemecoin prices also suffered from the decline in trading. Two of the more popular memecoins on Solana, BONK and WIF, are down over 60% from their December highs. Dozens of less popular memecoins have fared even worse.\n\nThe airdrop effect\n\nHistorically, airdrops have often preceded a surge in activity.\n\nIn September 2020, decentralised exchange Uniswap airdropped over $500 million worth of tokens to early users on Ethereum. Following the airdrop, DEX trading volumes on Ethereum exploded, rising from $17 billion in September 2020 to nearly $43 billion over the next four months.\n\nMore recently on December 7, the day of the Jito airdrop, Solana DEX volumes reached a yearly high before going on to set a new high on December 22.\n\nMany Solana bulls are now looking to the upcoming Jupiter airdrop to rekindle activity.\n\nJupiter announced in November that it will airdrop 40% of its soon-to-be-launched JUP token to early users.\n\nWith a 10 billion total token supply and pre-launch markets like Hyperliquid currently valuing JUP at around $0.65, this could amount to over $2.6 billion in airdrop value, or over nine times the amount given to users in the Pyth and Jito airdrops.\n\nJupiter has confirmed that it will airdrop tokens over four rounds, with the first round distributing one billion JUP.\n\nSome stability\n\nBut, amongst Solana\u2019s declining metrics, some appear to be stabilising.\n\nThe number of active wallets on Solana is still significantly higher than prior to the surge in activity.\n\nThrough the third quarter of 2023, the daily active wallets never surpassed more than 300,000, while now, even after a sharp decline in other metrics, daily active wallets still average over 640,000.\n\nTotal active wallets on Solana. (Solscan)\n\nTotal value locked, a metric that measures deposits into DeFi protocols, on Solana, has also remained elevated. It hit a 2023 high of $1.5 billion on December 25, and has held above $1.2 billion since the start of 2024.\n\nSolana's total value locked has held above $1.2 billion since the start of 2024.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "title": "Two Powerful Blockchain Platforms of the Future: Ethereum and Solana - Paxos",
        "content": "Blockchain, once overlooked in the shadow of cryptocurrency, is now a powerhouse player in its own right with implications far beyond the financial sector. From improving supply chain integrity to facilitating transactions for a wide range of digital assets, its use cases are vast and varied.\n\nBut what lies at the heart of this innovative technology, and how can it be harnessed? It is helpful for enterprises across many industries to understand the fundamentals of blockchain and how key platforms like Ethereum and Solana are leading the charge in this technological revolution.\n\nWhat is blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is digital ledger technology that documents transactions across a network of computers. It can log and track everything from cryptocurrency payments to real-world assets to legal agreements.\n\nBlockchain technology is renowned for its security and immutability. The technology\u2019s name stems from the fact that it\u2019s comprised of a series of \u201cblocks,\u201d with each containing transaction data, a timestamp and a cryptographic hash of the previous block. Every transaction is linked in a \u201cchain\u201d and distributed across numerous nodes.\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the blockchain, there\u2019s little risk of manipulation from entities like governments or financial institutions. In fact, a blockchain\u2019s structure makes it nearly impossible to retroactively alter any single record without changing all subsequent blocks.\n\nBlockchain technology offers transparency and decentralization, making it an attractive option for transactional applications\u2014among them, money movement, supply chain management and even digital identity verification.\n\nEthereum and Solana\n\nWithin blockchain technology, there are many different blockchain platforms. Two of the most prominent blockchain platforms are Ethereum and Solana, each with unique features and capabilities.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Ethereum, launched in 2015, is both a cryptocurrency and a platform for building decentralized applications. Ethereum introduced the concept of \u201c smart contracts ,\u201d or self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. The latest iteration of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is secured using a proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism\u2014essentially, th e process by which validators create new blocks. ( Learn more about consensus mechanisms and how they work here .)\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana is a newer blockchain platform that launched to the public in 2020. It\u2019s known for speed and efficiency. It employs a unique hybrid consensus model, combining proof-of-history (PoH) with proof-of-stake (PoS). This enables it to process transactions rapidly and with lower fees compared to Ethereum. As such, Solana is an attractive platform for high-frequency trading and other applications requiring quick transaction times.\n\nEthereum and Solana have gained popularity because they offer solutions to common pain points related to scalability, speed and cost. These platforms have also sparked an entire ecosystem of subsequent innovation: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality has given rise to decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe future of finance: instant transfers and more\n\nImagine a world where international suppliers are paid the moment goods are shipped, employees receive compensation in real-time and complex financial transactions are settled instantly. This immediacy not only streamlines business operations, but also opens doors to new financial strategies like dynamic pricing. The ripple effects of such capabilities include more agile, responsive and competitive businesses and a transformation of the way global commerce operates.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum and Solana have the potential to make such hypotheticals into realities. With their ability to power instant, 24/7 financial transactions across borders, blockchains may be particularly attractive to enterprises operating in multiple countries or those engaging in high-volume trade, not to mention the implications for sectors like e-commerce and digital supply chain management.\n\nBlockchain technology is evolving rapidly. Many enterprises need a hand when it comes to adopting it and maximizing its potential and a trusted partner can help you seamlessly integrate blockchain into existing operations.\n\nBlockchain is transforming the way we think about money, assets and transactions and is paving the way for new business models and strategies. With the right partners to help you navigate and implement blockchain systems, your business will be well-positioned to stay a step ahead in the digital finance era."
