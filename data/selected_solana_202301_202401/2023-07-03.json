        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDespite certain limitations and potential risks, the idea of using Ethereum (ETH) as a layer-2 for the Solana (SOL) blockchain is not as farfetched as it may seem, according to Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Yakovenko took a closer look at how such an integration could take shape, suggesting that the technical collaboration, is \u201cprobably more likely than you might think at first glance.\u201d\n\nLayer-2 solutions aim to address scalability issues faced by blockchains like Ethereum, which have experienced congestion and high transaction fees during periods of increased activity. Solana, known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, promises a blockchain platform capable of efficiently accommodating various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nPointing out that these scaling solutions \u201care bridge protocols that provide one-way security,\u201d Yakovenko argues that Ethereum being a layer-2 for Solana would mean that holders of SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain would have \u201cfinality guarantees\u201d of being able to safely exit back to Solana even in cases of transaction double spends or an invalid state transition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security. In this setup, holders of solana assets on ethereum would have finality guarantees that they can exit back\u2026 https://t.co/XE5ETsxGIW \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nMaking this setup work would first require submitting all the Ethereum transactions into Solana, according to Yakovenko, as well as submitting a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) root for the resulting state\u2014something that would serve as evidence that consensus has been reached among Ethereum validators regarding the state of the network.\n\nFinally, to identify and address possible faults within a bridge protocol, a bridge timeout mechanism will be necessary. Some examples of faults, per Yakovenko, include conflicting SPVs for the root, invalid root computation, and censorship.\n\nLimitations and risks of Solana's ETH-based L2\n\nThe Solana Labs co-founder also highlighted the limitations and potential risks associated with this integration, saying that while it would be safe to hold SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain, it will not be safe \u201cto lend them or maintain positions against them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne key risk is the possibility of an Ethereum fault or a contentious social consensus fork within the Ethereum network. In such a scenario, the representations of Solana assets held on Ethereum could become separated from the consensus fork, resulting in a situation where these assets become effectively worthless.\n\nIt would be safe to hold solana assets on ethereum, but not safe to lend them or maintain positions against them. This is because once there is an ethereum fault, ethereum state on solana becomes separated from ethereum the social consensus fork. Solana users can get their\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nLending Solana-based USDC, the dollar-pegged stablecoin from Circle, on Ethereum could lead to a situation where the borrower can withdraw the real USDC on the Solana network, while the lender on Ethereum receives a \"junk token.\"\n\nThis scenario, argues Yakovenko, is similar to the experience of holding USDC on Ethereum's Proof-of-Work (EthPow) chain, where certain tokens may lose value or functionality due to network issues or changes.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of Solana assets on Ethereum may have implications for various DeFi protocols. While central limit order books (CLOBs) would likely remain functional, automated market makers (AMMs), and non-flash loan borrowing and lending protocols could face limitations or challenges, potentially leading to inefficiencies or constraints in liquidity provision and trading.\n\nClobs are ok, AMMs and non flash loan borrow lending protocols are not. \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nYakovenko\u2019s proposal came hot on the heels of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin lamenting about how U.S. regulators are targeting various crypto projects, including Solana, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in its recent lawsuit against Binance labeled as unregistered securities.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up \u2018winning\u2019 through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn\u2019t even a victory,\u201d Buterin tweeted last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Bitcoin traded little changed and Ether gained on Monday morning in Asia, with prices of most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies mixed. Solana added to gains after a slump that followed it being labeled a security by the U.S. financial regulator. Litecoin led winners, still riding the optimism of being included in the tokens trading on the Wall Street-backed EDX Markets exchange that opened on June 20.\n\nMixed crypto\n\nBitcoin added 0.41% to US$30,730.25 over the last 24 hours to 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. After a jump that followed a raft of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the final weeks of June, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost direction, adding just 0.61% over the past seven days.\n\nThe U.S. regulator that approves ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on Friday indicated it was unimpressed by the Bitcoin ETF applications by financial heavyweights such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second biggest token by market capitalization, added 1.49% to US$1,954.67. It\u2019s gained 2.65% for the seven days.\n\nSolana was among the gainers in mixed early Asia trading for other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The token rose 5.48% to US$19.43 for a weekly gain of 14.47%.\n\nSolana is rallying after a raft of bearish indicators last week, with Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) protocol Cardinal saying it was shutting down, citing \u201cmacroeconomic challenges.\u201d The Revolut neobank and crypto exchange also reportedly told U.S.-based users last Wednesday that it will delist Solana, along with Cardano and Polygon.\n\nThe three tokens were among cryptocurrencies that the SEC named as illegally issued financial securities in its lawsuit filed last month against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum wrote on Twitter on Friday that the tokens don\u2019t deserve to be targeted. \u201cIf ethereum ends up \u201cwinning\u201d through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn\u2019t even a victory.\u201d\n\nLitecoin led the gainers with a 6.37% increase in the last 24 hours to US$112.96. The token surged 27.98% in the past seven days.\n\nLitecoin, which was created in 2011 as a hard fork to Bitcoin, was one of the four tokens selected to trade on the EDX Markets exchange, which is backed by Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments. The other tokens are Bitcoin, Ether and Bitcoin Cash. The New Jersey-based EDX opened for business despite the crackdown on crypto from U.S. regulators.\n\nThe California-based crypto exchange Kraken was ordered by a U.S. judge on Friday to submit information about its users to the Internal Revenue Service in an investigation of underreported tax liabilities. The crypto exchange was fined US$30 million in February by the SEC for its staking services, which the federal agency said were an offering of unregistered securities.\n\nOther crypto movers included Tron, which dipped 1.85% to US$0.07572, but gained 3.31% for the week. Binance\u2019s BNB token edged down 0.31% to US$247.13, and Cardano\u2019s ADA fell 0.13% to US$0.2905.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap edged up 0.02% to US$1.2 trillion, with trading volume dropping 7.54% to US$27.26 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFTs \u201cbrutal weekend\u201d\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.49% to 2,910.36 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 4.59% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dipped 9.68% to US$28.3 million, while volume on Ethereum rose 3.12% to US$22.3 million.\n\n\u201cBrutal weekend for NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cIt might be easy to point to Azuki\u2019s Elementals mint as the catalyst still, but lowering average sales and floor prices in top collections prior to Elementals mint showed that we were on the cusp of another free fall.\u201d\n\nThe Azuki Elementals collection began minting last Tuesday and sold out in 15 minutes, but left collectors disappointed as the latest collection looked almost the same as the original.\n\nAzuki founder Alex Xu, who goes by the moniker Zagabond, met with its community last Thursday to address complaints about the mint and Elementals issued a public apology on Twitter, saying they \u201cmissed the mark\u201d and that the new release diluted the value of the popular collection.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs topped the volume ranking on Cryptoslam at US$3.87 million. Another Ethereum-based collection, The Captainz, came in at second place with US$2.3 million.\n\nOver the weekend, the Memeland team behind The Captainz NFTs, revealed their PFPs or Profile Picture art upgrades for the collection but met with mixed to negative response. \u201cMost negative responses to the art came from people who were unaware that the art would be upgradeable with purchasable traits,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cWithout these traits the base characters are nearly identical, which caused some confusion in the NFT community.\u201d\n\nU.S. equity futures little changed\n\nU.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were little changed as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down 0.029%, S&P 500 futures dipped 0.011%, while Nasdaq Futures added 0.068%.\n\nU.S. equities rallied during regular trading on Friday, the last day of the first half of 2023, though face disruptions to trading this week with limited trading hours on Monday and the July 4 public holiday on Tuesday when equity markets will be closed.\n\nEconomic indicators to come this week include US manufacturing activity on Monday as well as a monthly jobs report on Friday. Tesla Inc.\u2019s Sunday announcement of record-breaking vehicle sales in the second quarter is a bullish factor for investors.\n\nJapan equities on Monday gained on the coattails of the Friday rally on Wall Street, with technology stocks leading the gains in Tokyo.\n\nIn China manufacturing slowed, but by less than expected. Both purchasing managers\u2019 Indices in Taiwan and South Korea also showed manufacturing contraction.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is traveling to China in an effort to try and improve communications and the frosty ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nInvestors are expecting more interest rate hikes this year in the U.S. following reiterated warnings from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in speeches last week in Europe that inflation has yet to be brought under control.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on July 26 and predicts only a 12.6% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"
