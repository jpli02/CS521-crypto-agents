You may ask why would we do that when Stepn had more than $120 million in profit in one quarter while SweatCoin likely earns way less than that annually?"

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs the fallout from the stunning collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) plays out, numerous crypto companies have signaled their exposure to the bank, which long maintained a reputation as one of the most prominent lenders to tech startups in the world.\n\nThe bank\u2019s closure Friday by the California Department of Financial Protection marked the second-largest bank failure in American history, after the undoing of Washington Mutual during the financial crisis of 2008. Silicon Valley Bank reported $212 billion in assets last quarter.\n\nThe stock (SIVB) began spiraling late Wednesday after rumors circulated that the institution was seeking an acquisition after failing to raise sufficient capital to cover its obligations. In the hours and days that followed, numerous venture capital funds reportedly advised their clients to withdraw their funds, resulting in $42 billion of withdrawals initiated on Thursday, constituting a run on the bank. On Friday morning, the Nasdaq halted trading of SIVB shares.\n\nThough it was venture capital firms and tech startups that were most severely affected by the SVB scare on Friday, numerous crypto companies have also disclosed their exposure to the bank. Here\u2019s a running list of the crypto firms caught in the crosshairs of SVB's collapse, along with those that have publicly claimed they avoided the damage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNote: On Sunday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chairman Martin Gruenberg issued a joint statement saying that all Silicon Valley Bank depositors would be made whole and have access to their funds on Monday, March 13. The Federal Reserve is now investigating the bank's failure.\n\nCrypto companies that had money in SVB\n\nRipple\n\nOn Sunday night, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse tweeted that Ripple \"had some exposure to SVB\u2014it was a banking partner, and had some of our cash balance.\"\n\nDespite this, Garlinghouse asserted that Ripple expects \"no disruption to our day-to-day business\" and that the company \"remains in a strong financial position.\"\n\nSetting the record straight on SVB Qs: Ripple had some exposure to SVB \u2013 it was a banking partner, and held some of our cash balance. Fortunately, we expect NO disruption to our day-to-day business, and already held a majority of our USD w/ a broader network of bank partners. \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) March 12, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlockFi\n\nFailed crypto lender BlockFi, which filed for bankruptcy in November in the wake of FTX's collapse, has $227 million in funds held at SVB, according to documents filed Friday related to BlockFi's bankruptcy proceedings. Those funds are reportedly not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) as they are in a money market mutual fund, which itself may constitute a violation of bankruptcy law.\n\nBlockFi first halted withdrawals just days after the implosion of crypto exchange FTX. The lender had previously been bailed out by FTX with a revolving $250 million line of credit, last June.\n\nPer new bankruptcy filing, BlockFi has $227m in Silicon Valley Bank. The bankruptcy trustee warned them on Mon that bc those funds are in a money market mutual fund, they\u2019re not FDIC secured \u2014 which could be a prblm w/ keeping in compliance of bankruptcy law pic.twitter.com/hnpo8anrrS \u2014 Lauren Hirsch (@LaurenSHirsch) March 10, 2023\n\nCircle\n\nCircle, issuer of the world's second-largest stablecoin USDC, announced on Friday that some undisclosed portion of the cash reserves used to back USDC and tie its value to the US dollar were held at Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nThe company said in a statement Friday that SVB was one of six banks relied on to manage USDC's cash reserves, but claims USDC will be able to continue operating normally.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank is one of six banking partners Circle uses for managing the ~25% portion of USDC reserves held in cash. While we await clarity on how the FDIC receivership of SVB will impact its depositors, Circle & USDC continue to operate normally.https://t.co/NU82jnajjY \u2014 Circle (@circle) March 10, 2023\n\nStablecoins like USDC are cryptocurrencies backed by and pegged to the value of real-world assets. They are meant to serve as a sturdy intermediary between traditional finance and more volatile crypto markets; USDC, with a market capitalization of $42.17 billion, is the second-most used stablecoin in the world. 25% of the assets backing USDC, which purports to be fully collateralized, are cash, according to Circle.\n\nLast week, Circle cut ties with collapsed crypto-friendly bank Silvergate, which shut down on Wednesday. Circle had also used Silvergate to hold cash reserves until that point.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPantera\n\nCrypto-focused venture capital firm Pantera may have an unknown amount of exposure to SVB's collapse. As recently as last month, the firm counted the failed bank among just three custodians of its private funds, according to a February 3 SEC filing.\n\nPantera counts among the largest crypto-focused VC firms in the world; last year alone it raised $1.3 billion for a fund exclusively focused on blockchain-based projects.\n\nAvalanche\n\nThe Avalanche Foundation, which supports the Avalanche blockchain, announced Friday evening that it has \"a little over\" $1.6 million in exposure to Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nAvalanche's native token AVAX, currently boasts a market capitalization of $4.84 billion.\n\nIn light of recent news, we would like to confirm that the Avalanche Foundation has no exposure to Silvergate and a little over $1.6mm of exposure to Silicon Valley Bank. Avalanche Foundation is saddened by the news about SI and SIVB, and hope that all depositors are made whole. \u2014 Avalanche \ud83d\udd3a (@avalancheavax) March 10, 2023\n\nYuga Labs\n\nYuga Labs, the $4 billion company behind dominant NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (among other projects), is exposed to SVB. Yuga co-founder Greg Solano said Friday that the company has \"super limited exposure\" to the failed bank, though Yuga has not yet confirmed exactly how much.\n\nSolano said the amount \"doesn't impact our business or plans in any way.\"\n\nBREAKING NEWS \u00bb @yugalabs Co-Founder @CryptoGarga Said that Yuga Labs Had \u201cSuper Limited\u201d Financial Exposure To The @SVB_Financial Fallout. pic.twitter.com/RXxBkyPOwX \u2014 The Bored Ape Gazette\ud83c\udf4c (@BoredApeGazette) March 10, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProof\n\nProof, another leader in NFTs, may have been hit harder.
