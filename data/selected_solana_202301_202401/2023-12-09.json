        "content": "Crypto analysts at the investment management giant VanEck are predicting big things for the Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) in 2024.\n\nMatthew Sigel, VanEck\u2019s head of digital assets research, and Patrick Bush, a digital assets senior investment analyst, predict that Ethereum will lose market share to Solana next year due to the latter project having \u201cless uncertainty surrounding their scalability roadmap.\u201d\n\nThe analysts also predict that Solana will rise to become a top-three blockchain by market cap, total value locked (TVL) and active users.\n\nThe TVL of a blockchain represents the total capital held within its smart contracts. TVL is calculated by multiplying the amount of collateral locked into the network by the current value of the assets. Solana currently ranks sixth among chains in terms of TVL, according to the decentralized finance aggregator DeFi Llama.\n\nSigel and Bush also predict that Solana will join the race for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. So far, financial firms have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSOL is trading at $74.05 at time of writing. The sixth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 6.65% in the past 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Amidst the recent upswing in the broader cryptocurrency market, Solana (SOL) has mirrored the trend, with growth exceeding 60% in the past month.\n\nInvestors seeking insights into the next potential price target for this digital asset may find information in a post on X by cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez on December 7.\n\n#Solana is approaching the apex of an ascending triangle that developed on its 12-hour chart. While this continuation pattern anticipates further gains for #SOL, caution is advised. \u26a0\ufe0f A sustained close above $68.2 will trigger a bullish breakout toward $90. But watch out for\u2026 pic.twitter.com/0b4DAAVmeA \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 7, 2023\n\nThe post underscores the significance of Solana closing above $68.2 and maintaining support at $60 as crucial factors propelling it toward the $90 threshold. As of the latest developments, Solana has not only surpassed this threshold but also closed above the predicted range, indicating a sustained bullish momentum in the near term.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Solana has exhibited bullish indicators, including a notable increase in its total value locked from $600 million to $833 million, as reported by Step Data Insights on December 9.\n\nSolana\u2019s Rally to Continue?\n\nSolana\u2019s native token, SOL, has experienced significant attention due to its rapid price increase, breaking above $70 and currently standing at around $77 apiece, which is more than a 500% increase since January 1.\n\nSOL\u2019s recent surge has turned it into one of the biggest performers of the altcoin market alongside Cardano and Avalanche, which have seen weekly surges of over 40% each.\n\nAdditionally, Solana has witnessed an increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) to approximately $670 million as of December 5, according to DefiLlama data. But this number remains considerably lower than the levels observed in the last quarter of 2021 \u2014 when SOL\u2019s price peaked at over $250, and the TVL exceeded $10 billion.\n\nNot only traders are bullish on Solana\u2019s price performance and its future. Investment firm VanEck anticipates Solana\u2019s entry into the cryptocurrency spot ETF competition by 2024, according to analysts Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush in a newly published report."

Moreover, the token caught the eyes of crypto traders and investors as it emerged as one of the top trending tokens within the crypto realm.\n\nIn addition, Jito positions itself as a Solana-based Defi platform, facilitating liquid staking.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the soaring of the JTO token appears to fall in line with the opening of an airdrop recently, evoking immense keenness among crypto fanatics. Meanwhile, the token\u2019s parent currency, Solana (SOL), also noted an upsurge in its price.\n\nJito (JTO) Token: Here\u2019s All You Need To Know\n\nJito stands as the second-largest liquid staking (LST) protocol catering to Solana users seeking to trade and borrow against SOL tokens locked with validators. JitoSOL, JTO\u2019s primary asset, acts as a depository receipt for staked SOL.\n\nFurthermore, the token orchestrates profits from both the staking processes within the Solana network. Besides, it also generates moonlight incomes via Jito\u2019s MEV-style method of auctioning blockspaces.\n\nThe JTO token initially commenced trading at the price of $1.20 but soon began noting a significant pump in its price. Intriguingly, the pump witnessed by the token was so bullish that even after the deposit of 7 million JTO to Binance, the price barely slumped.\n\nConcerning the aforestated data, the JTO token appears to be portraying significant bullish sentiments within the broader crypto market. Moreover, the Jito community recently initiated a token airdrop, allowing users to claim 90 million JTO governance tokens since Thursday morning.\n\nIn addition, the total value locked (TVL) for Solana Jito liquid staking now amounts to $486.84 million as of writing.\n\nAlso read: US, Japan, South Korea Forge New Front Against Crypto Money Laundering\n\nJito JTO Price Rallies\n\nThe Jito price, while writing, witnessed a colossal upswing of 36.20%, reaching $4.

Moreover, the token also noted a weekly upswing of 23.70%. Simultaneously, JTO\u2019s price surge may be linked to the jump witnessed by Solana.\n\nAs the JTO token continues to soar whoppingly, crypto market enthusiasts eagerly await the next milestone for the cryptocurrency, the $5 mark.\n\nAlso read: Popular Analyst Predicts 20% Further Rally In ADA, DOGE And DOT Prices"

        "content": "Solana NFTs Eclipse Ethereum in Trading Volume Amid Surge\n\nSolana (SOL) continues to experience upward momentum, with its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) witnessing considerably higher trading volume, surpassing even that of Ethereum.\n\nProjects like Mad Lads and Tensorians have seen significant price increases, multiplying several times over in recent weeks.\n\nMoreover, the collective trading volume of Solana NFTs has now surpassed that of Ethereum, which traditionally leads in trading volume and hosts the most valuable projects.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Solana NFTs have generated $14.8 million in trades, compared to approximately $13.9 million on Ethereum, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nThis surge in Solana trading volume represents a growth of about 92% in the past day.\n\nAmong the top traded projects during this period, Tensorians, associated with the Tensor NFT marketplace, leads the way with over $4 million in sales.\n\nWithin the Solana ecosystem, Tensor currently dominates with nearly 76% market share in the past 24 hours, as reported by Tiexo.\n\nPreviously, Magic Eden, the multi-chain marketplace that held a prominent position in the Solana space, now holds about 16% market share.\n\nSOL Extends Gains as Market Rally Continues\n\n\n\nOver the past couple of days, Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency SOL has posted significant gains and its leading meme coin BONK reached new all-time highs.\n\nOn Friday, SOL reached a new 19-month peak, touching $73.85.\n\nAlthough still a far cry from its all-time high of nearly $260 in November 2021, SOL has made a remarkable recovery from its low of around $8 in late 2022.\n\nCurrently trading above $73, SOL has recorded a 13% surge in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBONK, the leading meme coin on the Solana network, has been on a rapid ascent in recent weeks, setting a new all-time high price of $0.00001314 on Friday.\n\nEven with a slight dip to $0.00001283 at the time of writing, BONK has registered a 10% gain in the past 24 hours and tripled in value over the last seven days.\n\nIn the past month alone, BONK has skyrocketed by an astounding 982%, propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with a total market cap of $747 million.\n\nIn addition to the remarkable price performance, the recipients of the Jito airdrop on the Solana DeFi platform are also reaping substantial benefits.\n\nThe JTO token distributed to early users during the airdrop has surged by 72% in the past day, reaching $3.35 per token.\n\nLast week, Jupiter, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator running on the Solana blockchain, also announced the opening of initial claims for its JUP token airdrop.\n\nThe airdrop has been designed to distribute 40% of the total JUP token supply, which amounts to four out of the 10 billion tokens."

        "content": "SOL, the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain platform which uses a proof-of-stake mechanism to provide smart contract functionality, is on a bull rally as investors drive the price of the coin towards its all-time high.\n\nSolana\u2019s price has soared nearly 925% in 2023 so far, 100% in the last month, and 56% in the last seven days. The Solana price is currently trading at around $116. Crypto enthusiasts are expecting that Solana will touch $200 in 2024, as the $100 landmark figure is breached this week.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana Price Hits 20-Month High\n\nSolana\u2019s price is at its highest in not just the past one month or one year, but in the last 20 months. However, at around $116, Solana is still far from it\u2019s all-time high. Solana\u2019s ATH or all-time high was recorded in July 2021, when the cryptocurrency\u2019s price crossed the $250 mark.\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s current price seems to be pretty distant from its all-time high price, the current recovery in the coin\u2019s price could push it above and closer to Solana ATH.\n\nRise of Solana\n\nSolana was launched by Solana Labs in 2020. The cryptocurrency is known for its ultra-fast transactions at industry-low fees, along with staking SOL tokens and earning rewards. It has also been used to create NFT applications that allow users to mint and trade digital artwork.\n\nThe Solana network improved quite a lot after facing multiple network outages in 2022. It rose from the criticism and is emerging to be the best viable blockchain for NFTs, DeFi, Web3 games, and other decentralized applications. Web3 smartphone release announcements and a 100% uptime in the first half of 2023 demonstrates the improvement of the network this year.\n\nSolana, which reached its all time high in July 2021, saw a downfall in its price till March last year. Since then, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price has been following a downward price movement. From trading at around $21 in October, Solana price increased significantly and is floating at the $117 mark at the time of writing. The coin has gained more than 928% in the last 365 days, suggesting that there is further room for growth.\n\nSolana Price Prediction : Will $SOL reach $200 in 2024?\n\nSolana price reached a peak of around $123 on the occasion of Christmas, 2023. This is the highest price at which Solana has traded throughout this year. The network improvements, increasing Solana DeFi projects, and meme token listings such as BONK combined with an increase in its trading volume are leading to its price rise.\n\nSolana has been breaking all the resistance levels in the past one year. So, having analyzed the recent charts, there is a strong possibility for Solana to reach $200 in the coming few months, probably in mid-2024. So, a short to the question whether Solana will reach $200, is a yes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt seems like there is no stopping for the ongoing Solana price rally. Solana will definitely reach $200 if the current price rally and the trading volume keep up in the coming weeks. The Solana coin appears all set for the next bull rally that could help investors make profits from their Solana investments."
