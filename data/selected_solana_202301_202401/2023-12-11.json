        "content": "Solana-based Helium Network\u2019s HNT token quietly hit a yearly high of more than $5 during the weekend following a 60% price surge in seven days, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nHNT\u2019s price has retraced to $4.70 as of press time amid a broader market correction.\n\nThis price performance represents a turnaround for a network that has dealt chiefly with negative news about its product and migrating from its proprietary blockchain to Solana.\n\nHowever, despite HNT\u2019s incredible performance in the past few weeks, the token is still far from its all-time high. CryptoSlate\u2019s data shows it is down 91% from its $54 peak.\n\nWhat drove HNT\u2019s price?\n\nHNT\u2019s price surge can be primarily attributed to the launch of Helium Mobile\u2019s $20 monthly phone plan in the United States, offering users unlimited data, talk, and text.\n\nHelium\u2019s connectivity service offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional service providers, making an average American spend approximately $157 monthly solely on phone plans.\n\nThe connectivity services utilize Helium\u2019s 5G network to empower its users to set up mini-cell towers and expand the network\u2019s coverage.\n\n\u201cWith Helium Mobile Hotspots, subscribers can own and set up \u2018mini cell towers\u2019. Dead zones can become a thing of the past when anyone can become a builder and set up a hotspot to expand the network for themselves and the community,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nNova Labs, the entity behind Helium Network, partnered with T-Mobile to extend coverage for Helium Mobile in areas where the network is absent.\n\nBesides the launch of Helium Mobile, HNT has also benefited from the general optimism surrounding the Solana network ecosystem. During the past year, Solana has thrived despite previous connections to the disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThis resurgence has played a pivotal role in attracting a growing number of users to its ecosystem and predictions that it could gain more ground on rival smart contract-based blockchain network Ethereum.\n\n\u201cETH will lose market share to other smart contract platforms with less uncertainty surrounding their scalability roadmap, such as Solana,\u201d asset management VanEck predicted.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Solana Faces Correction After Surge Towards $80; Analysts Divided On Short-Term Outlook - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Solana (SOL) recently surged towards the $80 mark, marking a remarkable 70% increase in the 30 days leading up to December 8. However, the bears swiftly made their presence felt, initiating a correction with SOL currently trading above $65, with potential support at this level.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nThe bullish momentum had propelled SOL above the critical $65 resistance, finding support around the $69.50 mark, reflecting a positive trend in the 100 simple moving average. Despite the recent correction, analysts are optimistic about the bulls\u2019 resilience, suggesting that the $65 support level might remain active.\n\nThe recent surge in Solana\u2019s price follows a stunning 400% increase earlier in the year, with SOL languishing around $20 for most of 2022. However, in a surprising turn of events, the crypto market pumped SOL above $30 on October 24, setting the stage for a series of impressive rallies. The momentum slowed briefly around $65 on November 16 but rose again in December, pushing SOL above $70.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nThe landscape for Solana dramatically shifted on December 1 when Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, unveiled plans to integrate the Solana network, generating renewed interest in the ecosystem. Notably, this news sparked a surge in Bonk (BONK), a Solana SPL meme token listed on major exchanges like Bybit, KuCoin, and Solana\u2019s decentralized exchange, Orca, gaining an impressive 236% between December 1 and December 8.\n\nSolana Price Prediction\n\nAnalysts remain divided on the short-term outlook for SOL, with some anticipating a further correction if the price drops below the $55.00 support. On the flip side, a contingent of experts remains bullish, predicting that SOL could reach $100 by the end of the year.\n\nLooking ahead, short-term price predictions from Changelly for SOL indicate a potential 0.41% decrease, with experts anticipating a dip by December 12, 2023. Technical indicators showcase an 87% bullish market sentiment for Solana, while the Fear & Greed Index registers a score of 74, indicating greed prevailing in the market.\n\nFor the end of December 2023, crypto experts expect the average SOL rate to hover around $74.39. The minimum and maximum price projections stand at $67.52 and $81.25, respectively, offering a potential return on investment (ROI) of 13.6%.\n\nRelated Reading | Binance Faces Legal Hurdles: Analysts Weigh In On BNB\u2019s Future"

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMoney continued to flow into crypto investment funds last week, with investor altcoin interest centered on Solana and Avalanche, according to a new report.\n\nWhile investors were mostly focused on Bitcoin, funds giving exposure to Solana and Avalanche last week received $3 million and $2 million, respectively, digital asset fund manager CoinShares said on Monday.\n\nRenewed interest in Solana, the blockchain behind the sixth biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, SOL, and Avalanche, the network on which the asset AVAX runs, was sparked last month.\n\nThis was down to big names taking an interest in both networks: investment banking giant J.P. Morgan said in November it had used the Avalanche blockchain to tokenize portfolios; both Visa and Shopify have recently announced using Solana\u2019s blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSOL is right now trading for $69.99\u2014down over 4% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. But the coin has risen 15% over seven days. AVAX has shot up even more in the past week: it\u2019s up 66%, trading hands for $36.25.\n\nIn the past day, it\u2019s one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies and has gained 9% while the rest of the market struggles.\n\nCoinShares said that digital asset investment products experienced their 11th straight week of inflows of $43 million. Such products include asset managers like 21Shares, Bitwise, and Grayscale.\n\nInvestors are by far drawn to Bitcoin, CoinShares said, and they put $20 million into BTC products, bringing year to date inflows to $1.7 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Monday report added that renewed interest in Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was a \u201cremarkable turn-around.\u201d Seven weeks ago, investors were pulling money out of Ethereum products\u2014at the time creating year-to-date outflows of $125 million\u2014but now they\u2019re back in the black. So far this year, Ethereum funds have seen deposits totalling $19 million.\n\nBig investors are interested in the crypto sphere again because it\u2019s likely a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will get approved in the coming months, according to analysts.\n\nSuch a product would give traditional investors exposure to Bitcoin and the crypto world in a hassle-free and regulated way.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has shot up this year as a result.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Solana (SOL) has seen a sharp correction in the past day, falling over 13% after its monumental rally over the past few months.\n\nThis abrupt change has prompted speculation over whether SOL\u2019s bull run has ended, at least for now.\n\nWhile the future of Solana remains uncertain, an intriguing new option has emerged in the form of Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) \u2013 with many believing it offers similar upside potential to SOL but with lower risk.\n\nSOL Experiences Steep Sell-Off Amid FTX Liquidation Concerns\n\nSolana is currently trading around the $69.40 level, having erased all the gains made over the weekend.\n\nDespite SOL pulling back slightly in the past few hours, investor sentiment has turned cautious overall.\n\nSOL\u2019s pullback comes as $23.5 million worth of crypto assets linked to the now-bankrupt FTX and Alameda entities were transferred to major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX.\n\nThe funds were spread across 19 different tokens \u2013 including Solana itself.\n\nThis news has worried SOL holders, as liquidating assets from FTX and Alameda could exert downward pressure on the token\u2019s price.\n\nMoreover, SOL trading volume has spiked 32% in the last 24 hours, signaling traders could be selling to cut possible losses.\n\nHowever, the steep trajectory of Solana\u2019s latest bull run led some to think a pullback was inevitable.\n\nAs such, many investors remain optimistic that Solana could rebound later this week and resume its upward trajectory.\n\nExperts Divided on Solana\u2019s Fate in Final Weeks of 2023\n\nLooking ahead, where could Solana\u2019s price go in the final weeks of 2023?\n\nAfter reaching a high of $77.78 on Saturday, some analysts believe SOL could return to this area if the recent pullback is temporary.\n\nTyrexcrypto on Twitter predicted that SOL could even \u201cpump to $100\u201d in the coming days.\n\nHowever, some crypto commentators are less optimistic about Solana\u2019s prospects.\n\nTwitter user Caesar, who has over 96,000 followers, predicted that SOL will drop back to $40 before rising once more to $70.\n\nFellow pundit Upside-Down Crypto Data is also cautious about Solana\u2019s current situation \u2013 stating that he believes the token is beginning to look \u201ca bit overheated.\u201d\n\nThese conflicting views highlight the uncertainty around Solana\u2019s future at present.\n\nRegardless, it remains one of the most talked-about cryptos on the market and will likely continue to draw significant attention in the weeks ahead.\n\nDeflationary Bitcoin ETF Token Emerges as Top SOL Alternative\n\nAs Solana faces a period of volatility, some crypto investors are looking toward alternatives with intriguing upside potential.\n\nOne such option is Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF), a new ERC-20 asset that allows speculation on the impending launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nBTCETF utilizes a deflationary tokenomics model intended to increase value for holders over time.\n\nAs key milestones occur, like an ETF approval date or the first Bitcoin ETF officially trading, 5% of the total supply will be burned.\n\nThis reducing supply aims to reward early adopters and long-term holders amid the hype for these ETFs.\n\nNot only that, but BTCETF holders can also stake their tokens to earn yields of 79% per year \u2013 with over 332 million tokens staked already.\n\nAfter launching its presale in early November, Bitcoin ETF Token has raised a staggering $3.4 million in early funding.\n\nInvestors worldwide are clamoring to get involved while the BTCETF price is on offer at a discount relative to the eventual DEX listing price.\n\nConnor Kenny, a crypto YouTuber with over 171,000 subscribers, even endorsed Bitcoin ETF Token in a recent video.\n\nWith SOL facing potential headwinds and BTCETF looking primed for growth, the speculative upside makes it an intriguing alternative for crypto investors.\n\nInterested investors can buy BTCETF tokens for $0.0066 at btcetftoken.com.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.
