        "content": "Jito Amasses $3B in FDV\n\nJito is the latest protocol making waves in the Solana ecosystem and the crypto community, as the JTO token has surged over 100% in 24 hours after its airdrop, and the tremendous price uptick has benefited SOL users considerably.\n\nJito, developed by Jito Labs \u2014a major node operator for Solana\u2014 is Solana\u2019s newest liquid staking protocol and by far the second-largest in terms of TVL.\n\nOnly surpassed by Marinade, Jito currently boasts over 6.4 million SOL locked in \u2014around $460 million.\n\nThe token experienced a significant trading volume of $1.1 billion within 24 hours after being airdropped to community members, trading at $1.9 and surging to $3.50, over 100% in 24 hours. The price has since retraced, and it\u2019s currently trading at $3.39.\n\nThe rise in SOL\u2019s value can also be attributed to the Jito airdrop, which distributed 10% of the total supply of 1 billion JTO tokens to eligible Solana users. That said, some users gained significant amounts of the JTO token by previously staking small amounts of SOL. At least 9,000 users who interacted and staked SOL received a minimum of 4,941 JTO tokens.\n\nThe Hype Surrounding Jito\n\nJito is one of the hottest topics in the Solana ecosystem. It allows users to deposit SOL in exchange for the derivative JitoSOL, representing participation in the staking process.\n\nHowever, most hype centers on the protocol\u2019s underlying technology and the combination of liquid staking and MEV (miner extractable value) optimization.\n\nSolana has faced significant challenges related to MEV, including network congestion and disruptions caused by spam transactions. That\u2019s where Jito\u2019s relayer acts as an independent transaction processing unit that alleviates the burden on validators, enhancing network stability.\n\nAs such, the critical role of the Jito validator is to optimize the MEV market and provide a strong defense against these spam transactions.\n\nJito\u2019s total supply is capped at 1 billion tokens, with 115 million currently in circulation. Of these, 80 million were allocated for the community airdrop, benefiting early users, validators, and other contributors."

        "content": "SOL is now trading at over $76.\n\nIts social dominance has risen to one of the highest points.\n\nSolana [SOL] continues to experience a steady upward trend, sparking increased discussions around it in recent times.\n\nSolana finds a new price range\n\nRecently, Solana surpassed the $70 price range, marking the first time in months. A detailed analysis of the daily timeframe chart revealed significant uptrends in the past few days.\n\nOn 7th December, it experienced a 9.57% surge, reaching over $67. The subsequent trading session on 8th December saw an even higher increase of 10.59%, pushing the SOL price beyond $74.\n\nAt the time of writing, it had climbed to over $76, reflecting a 1% increase. The last time SOL traded in similar price ranges was around May 2022.\n\nFurthermore, as of the current assessment, all signals indicate a bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above 75, signifying a bullish trend in an oversold position with a potential for correction.\n\nAdditionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) was over zero, and the lines were trading above 4, highlighting a robust bull trend. This remarkable trend has also captured the attention of the broader cryptocurrency community.\n\nSolana asserts some social dominance\n\nThe recent surge in Solana\u2019s price trend has significantly amplified the volume of discussions about SOL.\n\nIts social dominance chart on Santiment indicated this. An analysis of this chart showed that it has climbed to one of its highest points in nearly five months.\n\nAt the time of writing, the social dominance was around 4.9%. The last instance of higher social dominance occurred on 1st November, reaching around 5.7%.\n\nAdditionally, the current social dominance level indicates that SOL is presently a subject of discussion in nearly 5% of the crypto space.\n\nThis suggests a potential scenario where more individuals might be compelled to buy in due to fear of missing out (FOMO), contributing to further upward pressure on the price.\n\nSolana volume wax stronger\n\nExamining the volume chart on Solana showed a notable convergence between price and volume. The chart illustrates that the volume started to rise simultaneously with the price increase.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nBefore the price surge, the volume was around $3 billion. However, following the consecutive price increases, the volume went over $4 billion.\n\nAs of this writing, the volume was around $3.1 billion. This substantial increase strongly signals heightened trading activity, indicating a potential continuation of the upward price trend."

        "title": "Shift In Buying Momentum: Investor Interest Rises In Pullix ($PLX) Over Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "WEB3\n\nSolana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) have come a long way in 2023, each seeing some investor activity. However, Pillux, an upcoming DeFi platform, is looking more profitable in the long run for investors.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Polkadot (POL) are among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and are two altcoins pulling the attention of investors looking to quadruple their profits. But there's another coin that is quickly becoming a top pick for investors, amassing a range of remarkable features that set the scene for it to be one of the best new cryptos to invest in as the crypto market shows more excitement. In this piece, let's find out why Pullix is gaining more interest than Solana and Polkadot.\n\nPullix ($PLX): Assets Diversification and Liquidity Provision Rallying Investors\n\nPullix ($PLX) is a highly promising cryptocurrency project set to revolutionize the trading landscape by offering a comprehensive range of assets, including commodities, ETFs, and forex, rarely found in traditional platforms. Distinguishing itself from the norm, Pullix implements a fee structure with zero commission fees and visible tight spreads, enhancing overall profitability for traders, aligning with decentralized finance (DeFi) principles.\n\nPlaying a pivotal role in resolving liquidity issues within the DeFi space, Pullix introduces a liquidity provision, allowing traders to contribute liquidity through its dedicated Market Making Liquidity Contribution feature. Additionally, investors can stake cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC to enhance liquidity in the order book.\n\nAnother interesting feature offered by Pullix is the opportunity for traders to earn a passive monthly income through staking other cryptocurrencies for a fixed period and interest rate. This unique offering sets Pullix apart, as major players like Coinbase or Binance do not currently provide a comparable feature.\n\nCurrently trading at $0.04, Pullix positions itself as an attractive investment option for traders seeking a unified platform for seamless trading, rewards accumulation, and wealth enhancement. The $PLX, doubling as both governance token and native asset, acts as a gateway to a host of enticing features, including platform usage, exclusive access, reduced trading fees, rewards unlocking, exchangeability, and staking.\n\nConsidering its comprehensive features and a projected 100x surge in price, industry experts anticipate a growing influx of investors that may consider Pullix over Solana and Polkadot.\n\nSolana (SOL) Sees More Bullish Sentiment But Investors Are Careful\n\nSolana (SOL) has seen a surprising price surge to $61 since the start of the year when it traded for $9. However, Solana (SOL) has not maintained this upswing. It is currently worth $61, compared to a high price of $66 on December 6, 2023.\n\nIn addition to its surge, SOL caught the crypto market's eyes with its total value locked (TVL) on Solana rising to around $670 million on December 5, according to DefiLlama. This last occurred in November 2022.\n\nSentiment around the Solana coin is bullish, with analysts saying it could witness an upward climb. InvestAnswers, a prominent crypto analyst, predicts that Solana (SOL) might capture 10% of Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization in the next bull market.\n\nIf the Solana price sustains above its current price, the altcoin will continue its climb. Regardless, investors are aware that SOL has been trading under bearish for a week and are being careful. However, the price continues to trade above the pivotal support.\n\nPolkadot (POL) Witnesses 7 Day High Of above 6%, a 10.23% Increase\n\nPolkadot (POL), a layer 0 blockchain focused on interoperability and scalability, rose 10.23% to $6.13 on December 6, after seven days of trading above the $5 mark.\n\nBetween November 1 and November 30, Polkadot price (DOT) surged 16% from $4.45 to $5.16. Moreover, between November 23 and November 30, Polkadot (DOT) gained 7% as its price moved from $5.21 to $5.56.\n\nInvestors still hold a 41% bearish sentiment for the Polkadot coin, according to experts at Changelly. The coin was outperformed by 60% of the top 100 cryptocurrency assets in one year.\n\nNevertheless, many analysts hold that the project still possesses potential. They predicted Polkadot (DOT) might reach $7 in December 2023, but some investors aren't entirely keen. This may have contributed to the rise of investors flocking to Pullix as it has a great potential of witnessing a price and value surge once it launches in 2024.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale, see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities"

        "title": "Bankman-Fried's crypto portfolio would be up billions this year \u2014 thanks to Solana - Blockworks",
        "content": "Raging crypto prices might have you gripped by fear of missing out. But no matter the frustration you\u2019re feeling, Sam Bankman-Fried likely has it much worse.\n\nThe disgraced FTX founder has been holed up in the infamous Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center since he was found guilty of a mess of fraud charges last month \u2014 the same jail currently housing R. Kelly, Fetty Wap and the New York City subway attacker.\n\nNo doubt Bankman-Fried found trading crypto difficult since FTX went bust. Bail conditions meant he\u2019d only have access to a flip phone that couldn\u2019t connect to the internet and a laptop with limited functionality.\n\nBefore his $250 million bail was revoked in August due to suspected witness tampering, Bankman-Fried had spent nine months on house arrest at his parents\u2019 multi-million home in Palo Alto.\n\nBankman-Fried also couldn\u2019t open any credit lines, start a business or transact anything more than $1,000 (outside of settling legal fees).\n\nRead more: FTX began to unravel one year ago today: A timeline\n\nThe price of bitcoin exploded about two weeks after Bankman-Fried touched down in New York, having been extradited from the Bahamas just before Christmas.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is now up about 160% since then and the total crypto market cap has swelled by nearly $900 billion.\n\nBankman-Fried faces perhaps more than 100 years in jail. But while he waits for his sentencing next March, he could very well be wondering: What if his risky bets actually paid off?\n\nWhat if FTX survived to see Bitcoin retake $44,000?\n\nJust one day before FTX filed for bankruptcy protection and about a week after a $5 billion bank run, Bankman-Fried mapped out the crypto exchange\u2019s balance sheets in a table that was later shared by the Financial Times.\n\nThe sheet, reportedly dated Nov. 10, 2022, shows FTX assets worth almost $9.6 billion, with about two-thirds ($6.4 billion) able to be easily backtested.\n\nCrypto made up $4.9 billion with an additional $631 million in stablecoins.\n\nSerum (SRM) made up around half of FTX\u2019s crypto. The token is tied to the decentralized exchange on Solana, which Bankman-Fried founded.\n\nCash and stocks worth $827 million made up about 9% of the total sheet.\n\nTurns out, FTX would be close to 40% up on its measurable portfolio, which would be now worth $9 billion \u2014 potentially up to $2.6 billion ahead. That\u2019s despite a near 90% crash in serum (SRM), by far FTX\u2019s biggest holding as it entered bankruptcy, per the sheet.\n\nGoodbye serum, hello solana\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s sheet doesn\u2019t list token prices, only US dollar values, which makes it difficult to calculate the exact number of tokens on FTX\u2019s balance sheet. There\u2019s no guarantee the spreadsheet is complete or even totally correct (the firm\u2019s GBTC holdings were later found to be much higher, for example).\n\nIt\u2019s also not feasible to properly value some of more illiquid assets, such as FTX\u2019s $1.5 billion venture capital portfolio and his half-billion stake in AI startup Anthropic.\n\nRead more: How long could Bankman-Fried go to jail following trial?\n\nStill, enough details lineup with bankruptcy filings that we can roughly gauge the general health of FTX\u2019s treasury then and now.\n\nIf we take prices around those days and compare them to now, it\u2019s clear that solana (SOL) would have made all the difference (and presumably has benefitted the bankruptcy estate extremely well).\n\nThanks to a stellar 400% recovery, from $14 to beyond $70 today, FTX\u2019s $982 million SOL stake could be worth over $5 billion.\n\nThe bulk of FTX and Alameda\u2019s SOL is still locked, pending a release schedule over the next few years. But the irony is that those gains have come, in part, due to Solana shaking the funk of its association with Bankman-Fried, who was one of the ecosystem\u2019s biggest and loudest backers.\n\nNow FTX just has to sell it\n\nAptos, the layer-1 blockchain repurposed from Meta\u2019s failed project Diem, would\u2019ve also helped with $312 million after its APT token more than doubled. FTX\u2019s position would have climbed from $375 million to $690 million as a result.\n\nAnother $100 million came from gains in Robinhood stock (in real life, the latter was bought back by the online brokerage in September).\n\nWorst performers would\u2019ve been ascendex (ASD) \u2014 down 42% to lose $14 million \u2014 and oxygen (OXY), on which he\u2019d lose $45 million.\n\nAnother $69 million was sunk with the collapse of Fantom algorithmic stablecoin USD Balance, which lost its dollar peg in June. Not to mention the $2 billion in bitcoin and ether (ETH) liabilities, those have surely ballooned due to their own price rallies.\n\nAfter Bankman-Fried stepped down, FTX was taken over by storied bankruptcy guru John J. Ray III, who handled Enron after its own sprawling fraud scandal. The plan for FTX is to refund 90% of recovered assets to creditors out of $8.7 billion owed in total.\n\nThe \u2018Bankman-Fried\u2019 line shows the performance of his Nov. 10 balance sheet, minus his venture capital portfolio and private equity stakes\n\nDespite his attempts to maintain innocence, Bankman-Fried\u2019s jury found him guilty on all seven criminal fraud counts.\n\nHe was legally (and morally) responsible for siphoning billions from FTX user accounts to prop up his failing hedge fund, Alameda Research, so it\u2019s more than likely the crypto on Bankman-Fried\u2019s balance sheet technically belonged to its users.\n\nFTX has now been cleared to sell billions of dollars in crypto alongside large sums in crypto stocks like Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin and ether trusts.\n\nSo, while Bankman-Fried sits in jail and perhaps thinks about whether his dumb bets would\u2019ve paid off (which it sorta seems they would have), all we can do is hope John J. Ray and the FTX estate don\u2019t fumble the bag.\n\nUpdated Dec. 10, 2023 at 6:03 am ET: Added context.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
