        "title": "Solana proposes network upgrade changes following recent outage - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko said plans are in place to improve network reliability.\n\nThe Solana network suffered a significant outage on Feb. 25, leading to downtime that lasted close to 20 hours. It was the first interruption of service to occur this year. However, 2022 saw 11 major outages and 3 minor ones \u2013 cementing a reputation for poor network reliability.\n\nYakovenko said last week\u2019s outage was related to the 1.14 network update, which was intended to bring speed and scale improvements.\n\n\u201cUp to the 1.14 release, core engineers were working to fix live problems that were impacting the network\u2019s speed and usability. These issues included invalid gas metering, lack of flow control for transactions, lack of fee markets, spiraling ram, storage and restart overhead.\u201d\n\nHowever, the rollout of the 1.14 update triggered significant network degradation, the cause of which is unknown at this time. An investigation to determine the root cause is still ongoing.\n\nSolana focused on network stability\n\nAddressing the issue will focus on improving the software release process for updates. This will involve using external developers and auditors to hunt for bugs and exploits.\n\nOther changes include forming an adversarial team to \u201cbuild additional hooks and instrumentation into the validator code\u201d for more thorough testing. Also, looking into simpler, more efficient network restart procedures.\n\n\u201cNodes should be automatically discovering the latest optimistically confirmed slot and sharing the ledger with each other if it is missing.\u201d\n\nYakovenko said over the past 12 months, Solana was already working on improving network stability through various initiatives, including building a second validator client, better tooling, upgrading the network communication protocol to \u201cQUIC,\u201d and improvements to the RPC infrastructure.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Dennis Diatel Photography / Getty Images\n\nThe crypto market has been battered since 2022, and it has been a rollercoaster for several assets. Implosions, fears of contagion and ensuing confusion have put an enormous strain on several of them.\n\nThe Future of Finances: Gen Z & How They Relate to Money\n\nSee: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nYet, while it\u2019s too early to tell whether it has recovered, crypto seems off to a better start in 2023. Take, for example, the Solana blockchain and its native coin (SOL).\n\nSolana\u2019s \u2018Rocky Six Months\u2019\n\nFollowing the collapse of FTX \u2014 with which Solana was entangled \u2014 Solana\u2019s asset value was one of the most impacted. Its market capitalization dropped by 70%, according to a Messari report.\n\nLive Richer Podcast: How To Leverage Your Investments\n\nYet, over just the past two weeks, SOL has rebounded and was up 8.1% as of Feb. 27, according to CoinGecko, hovering around $24. It is up a whopping 133% year to date, according to CoinDesk data. On the other hand, it is also down 91% from its Nov. 6, 2021, all-time-high of $259.96, according to CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cSolana has had a rocky six months, from its association with Sam Bankman-Fried to this recent forking incident,\u201d said Christopher Alexander, chief communications officer of Liberty Blockchain. \u201cThe market clearly believes in Solana\u2019s long-term vision. If you believe in coins that are building infrastructure like Ethereum, it makes sense to support that chain.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the forking incident that made the asset\u2019s price drop, Alexander attributes it to the fact that Solana prefers to move fast and that comes at a price, while Bitcoin and Ethereum have a strategy to proceed with caution.\n\n\u201cSpeed allows innovation that means Solana leaps ahead of its competition in the Layer 1 [blockchain] space,\u201d he said. \u201cThe downside is that they can fail or succeed spectacularly and the timing of something breaking now is unfortunate for them.\u201d\n\nOther Coins and Trends To Watch\n\nExperts say there are a few other assets and trends worth watching this year, each for different reasons \u2014 even though everyone is proceeding with extreme caution.\n\nAccording to Hayden Hughes, co-founder and CEO of Alpha Impact, Polygon (MATIC) is one of them. It has been warmly received by the investor community, notably on the heels of announcements by Instagram and JPMorgan that they\u2019ll be using the blockchain for settlement and trading of digital assets.\n\nAnother one to watch, according to Hughes, is UNI.\n\n\u201cThe Uniswap token shares its name with the largest decentralized exchange on the market,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cAlthough the token is not used directly in Uniswap\u2019s ecosystem, this is rumored to be changing. The team is focused on building utility for the token.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother Focus: Liquid Staking Derivatives\n\nAnother area of interest according to several experts, is liquid staking derivatives (LSDs). Lido (LDO), he said, is the largest of the so-called LSDs, which allows users to deposit locked assets, with the view of bringing liquidity to the assets that previously were not interchangeable.\n\nMatt Maximo, research analyst at Grayscale, noted that he too sees LSDs as an area of interest this year. Lido\u2019s stETH offers investors a way to gain exposure to Ethereum (ETH) and staking yield, while also being compatible with DeFi.\n\n\u201cFor many users, investors and traders, it may be more advantageous to hold the LSD derivative of Ethereum,\u201d Maximo said, \u201cas it provides liquid exposure to ETH and staking yield, instead of just holding ETH or locking it up in a validator.\u201d\n\nWith the Shanghai hardfork, Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade, expected in the next few weeks, LSDs have performed extremely well this year. The largest tokens \u2014 such as FXS, RPL, LDO \u2014 have gained more than 125%.\n\n\u201cI expect this trend to continue long term into and beyond the Shanghai hard fork,\u201d Maximo said. \u201cGranted, there may be some short-term volatility with ETH unlocks and macro headwinds.\u201d\n\nLayer 2, RWA and More\n\nAdditional areas of interest for 2023 include significant growth in Layer 2 scaling solutions, which was reaffirmed by the recent launch of Coinbase\u2019s L2 solution \u201cBase.\u201d\n\nFinally, Maximo said real world asset (RWA) tokenization on the blockchain is a process that may seem gradual and unassuming, but once it reaches a critical mass, it is bound to surprise and captivate everyone with its immense growth and impact.\n\n\u201cStablecoins serve as a notable illustration of the potential value of tokenized RWAs within the crypto landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond stablecoins, other RWAs such as bonds, Treasury bills, real estate, commodities and more can also be tokenized and transacted on a decentralized network.\u201d\n\nIn addition, crypto experts such as Dara Albright note the emergence of \u201cnext-gen self-sustainable altcoins in the Participate-2-Earn space that enables individuals to be compensated for their participation in their routine activities such as learning, exercising, binge-watching.\u201d\n\nAlbright, an expert with crypto marketplace Earnity and host of the Decent Millionaire podcast, pointed out Health Hero, a Health-2-Earn company that incentivizes users for staying healthy.\n\n\u201cNot only because it possesses a long-term, supportable pricing support system for its token that taps into $15 billion of healthcare-related real-world assets,\u201d Albright said, \u201cbut because of the healthcare benefits it could bring about on a macro level.\u201d\n\nFocus on Utility\n\nAll in all, while the crypto space seems to be slowly regaining ground following the depths of the seemingly never-ending crypto winter, lessons from the FTX bust have been learned and experts are proceeding with caution about what the future holds.\n\nTransparency, viability and utility are taking precedence over short-lived, hyper-hyped trends.\n\nAs Calanthia Mei, co-founder of Masa Finance, noted, trends are fueled by the narratives that drive them; and, like the seasons, they are constantly changing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some absolutely wild trends historically,\u201d Mei said. \u201cFlashback to DeFi summer, where coins named after food which could be yield-farmed were all the rage. To meme coin madness, where coins named after every breed of dog imaginable were skyrocketing.\n\n\u201cWhile these trends were fun, fast-paced and extremely volatile,\u201d Mei added, \u201cwe see this year as a new chapter for crypto and a turning point for the industry. As investors separate the signal from the noise, we see a focus on real utility, scalability, network adoption and value being key to the next cycle.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment is also echoed by Arie Trouw, co-founder of XYO Network, who also said it\u2019s better to focus on trends within the crypto industry that offer sustainable value for the longer term.\n\n\u201cThere are so many flash-in-the-pan pumps that focusing on any one coin could be dangerous for investors,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially those who are new to the industry.\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, infrastructure projects that aim to solve real problems are a good start, he added.\n\n\u201cThis includes, for example, oracle projects that serve as the key data feeds connecting blockchains with the rest of the world, as well as blockchains with other blockchains,\u201d Trouw said. \u201cIndeed, as blockchain networks continue to grow, they will increasingly need data for a wide variety of purposes.\u201d\n\nTrouw added that the blockchain networks themselves \u2014 Ethereum, Solana and Polygon, etc. \u2014 are all experiencing solid user growth and technical development.\n\n\u201cIn turn, developers are increasingly attracted to them because they know that there\u2019s growing user interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more developers and the more users a chain has, the better the longer term will look. Overall, it\u2019s hard not to be bullish on the space, but it behooves investors to do their research before getting exposure to any particular project.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Solana, Other Altcoins and Crypto Trends To Watch in 2023"

Overall, it\u2019s hard not to be bullish on the space, but it behooves investors to do their research before getting exposure to any particular project.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Solana, Other Altcoins and Crypto Trends To Watch in 2023"

Let\u2019s quickly explain the difference between these two types of wallets.\n\nSoftware Solana wallets\n\nSoftware Solana wallets include browser extension wallets, mobile wallets and desktop wallets. These are \u201chot wallets\u201d, since the private keys are stored on a device that\u2019s connected to the internet. Hot wallets are convenient to use, but come with more security risks as they are vulnerable to online attacks.\n\nHardware Solana wallets\n\nHardware cryptocurrency wallets are devices that securely store the private keys necessary for transacting with cryptocurrencies. These are \u201ccold wallets\u201d, as the devices are not connected to the internet. Even though you have to connect your hardware wallet to your computer or mobile phone to make transactions, the hardware wallet only signs transactions, but doesn\u2019t disclose the private keys to the connected device.\n\nHowever, there are also downsides to hardware wallets. You have to buy a physical device, and they\u2019re also less convenient to use than software wallets.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014What\u2019s the best wallet for Solana?\n\nIf you\u2019re investing in Solana and need a wallet, there\u2019s a wealth of options for you to explore. In this article, we have featured 7 high-quality Solana wallets for all kinds of cryptocurrency users.\n\nThe choice of the best Solana wallet for you will depend on various factors. For example, if you just need a wallet for Solana, you can\u2019t go wrong with Phantom or Solflare. On the other hand, a wallet like Trust Wallet will serve you better if you want to hold other cryptocurrencies as well. For users that put a lot of value on security, it\u2019s definitely worth considering hardware Solana wallets like the Ledger Nano S Plus.\n\nSetting up a cryptocurrency wallet, be it a software or a hardware one, is one of the most important steps you can take to make your crypto investing journey safe and secure.
