        "content": "Polygon, formerly known as the Matic network, is a scalable blockchain platform that uses the Ethereum virtual machine. The popular blockchain platform handles developers' needs by providing them with tools to develop scalable decentralized applications with better performance and UX.\n\nThe blockchain platform\u2019s speed and reliability have helped it grow substantially in the gaming space. Games like Aavegotch and Zed Run are increasingly popular apps running on the Polygon network.\n\nPolygon is capable of handling 65,000 client transactions per second, which allows users to make faster transactions than on Ethereum and even with Visa or Mastercard. These lightening fast transition speeds are an opportunity to develop innovative blockchain applications."

        "content": "Solana lost its key support at $20 and is now accelerating down.\n\nSolana Price Analysis\n\nKey Support levels: $17, $15\n\nKey Resistance levels: $20, $23\n\nSOL failed to maintain its price within the descending triangle, and with the support at $20 turned into resistance, it\u2019s currently in search of support. The key levels to watch are found at $17 and $15, with the latter having the highest confidence.\n\nTrading Volume: The sustained sell volume in the past week has pushed Solana into making lower lows.\n\nRSI: The daily RSI is quickly approaching the oversold area at under 30 points. Hopefully, buyers will become interested again.\n\nMACD: The daily MACD is in freefall, and there are no signs that this downtrend will end at this time.\n\nBias\n\nThe bias for SOL is bearish.\n\nShort-Term Prediction for SOL Price\n\nThe most likely area where Solana can stop this selloff is found at $15. The support at $17 may provide a relief bounce, but considering this momentum, it is unlikely to hold for long."

        "content": "Tensor, the smaller-scale contender within Solana, is taking on a highly aggressive stance in a bid to expand its market share. Taking some leaves from the (virtual) playbook of the NFT marketplace Blur, the company is taking aim at professional traders through a loyalty rewards program.\n\nThis follows the company\u2019s launch of its Season 1 Airdrop last week, which allowed Solana NFT owners to claim reward boxes, which were provided proportionally based on that traders activity.\n\nAccording to the company, any collectors that have bought or sold a Solana-based NFT on any related marketplace, so long as they happened in the last 6 months, will be eligible.\n\nOverall, in concept, Tensor\u2019s program is quite similar in structure to the model that Blur piloted recently, especially as it jockeyed against the more established OpenSea.\n\nAnd how is it going so far? Analytics platform Dune has reported that its trading volume on Solana has shot up significantly since its season 1 airdrop \u2013 reaching nearly $500k in trading volume by the end of the day. In addition, Tensor has become a facilitator of nearly one-fifth of all NFT trading volumes on Solana.\n\nWhile riding this trading high, the company also announced a new seed funding round of $3 million, which is being led by Placeholder, with support from Solana Ventures, MonkeVentures, and others."

        "content": "A Solana-based alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) called Access Protocol ($ACS) has seen its price surge over 200% after a major South Korean cryptocurrency trading platform announced it was listing its token.\n\nAccording to a recently published announcement from Upbit, a Seoul-based exchange Upbit, which has been registering more trading volumes than any other exchange in the country after Binance, the Solana-based altcoin is being added in a trading pair against the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin ($BTC).\n\nThe price of ACS soared nearly 300% on the day of the announcement, from $0.00467 to a $0.0185 high, before moving back down to $0.0123 at the time of writing, representing a rise of over 200% to date.\n\nBuilt on top of Solana and Ethereum scaling solution Starknet, Access Protocol is a new content monetization crypto project. The project aims to give content creators the ability to create their own paywall on their site and offer premium content to supporters, providing both subscribers and content creators with daily rewards in a 50-50 split.\n\nThe ACS token is used by subscribers to enter creator pools and access content, while also earning them daily rewards. This new model for content monetization has captured the attention of investors and Upbit\u2019s support has only fueled ACS\u2019s rapid ascent.\n\nAs CryptoGlobe reported, earlier this year meme-inspired cryptocurrency Shiba Inu ($SHIB) led the \u201ctrending\u201d charts on popular crypto aggregator websites after it was listed on Upbit. The listing came ahead of the beta launch of its layer-2 project Shibarium.\n\nThe rise of Access Protocol and other altcoins like Shiba Inu demonstrates the growing appetite for alternative cryptocurrencies beyond the more traditional digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This rise shows investors\u2019 appetite for up-and-coming projects hasn\u2019t waned, despite the bear market.\n\nImage Source\n\nFeatured image via Pixabay."
