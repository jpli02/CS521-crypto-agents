        "content": "Latest and important crypto news regarding Solana (SOL). Apparently, Solana plans to improve its blockchain after the recent outage that generated concern among users.\n\nFurthermore, it seems that the first \u201cbacked\u201d real estate NFTs are being launched, allowing users to invest in real \u201ctokenized\u201d homes.\n\nSolana crypto news: enhancement to the blockchain\n\nAfter a network slowdown left users in a panic, Solana released plans to improve its latest network upgrade.\n\nFollowing the latest network update 1.14 on 25 February, the Solana network experienced a significant slowdown in blockchain production. Reacting immediately to the transaction disruptions, validators downgraded the software to increase performance.\n\nHowever, on 28 February, Anatoly Yakovenko, founder and CEO of Solana Labs, issued another statement on how the ecosystem plans to improve the network\u2019s recent upgrades. The main goal of the plan is stability as the network continues its transition.\n\nIndeed, Yakovenko stated:\n\n\u201cThe 2022 priorities were building new features and new tools. 2023 is stability. Tldr 1/3 of core eng will focus on stability and adversarial testing. Here are my thoughts.\u201d\n\nThe statement outlines a six-step plan for engineers to help streamline the process and reveals the formation of an adversary team, which includes one-third of Solana\u2019s engineering team.\n\nThis team was formed to implement additional hooks and instrumentation in the validator code and to detect exploits in the underlying protocols.\n\nIt has also defined ways to focus on finding the stability of the entire network. This includes a second validator client developed by Jump Crypto\u2018s firedancer team and Mango DAO developers creating new tools and implementing local fee markets, among other efforts.\n\nPrior to version 1.14, key engineers were working to fix problems that affected the speed and usability of the network, such as invalid gas calculation, lack of flow control for transactions, and lack of fee markets, among other more technical issues.\n\nThese issues were prioritized to improve the user experience. However, after the latest release, core engineers plan to engage other developers and external auditors to test and find exploits.\n\nDisruption of the Solana blockchain: the reasons why\n\nYakovenko\u2019s recent statement mentions that the investigation into what happened during the initial outage is still ongoing, and the community will be informed when the information becomes available.\n\nIn any case, he clarified on 28 February that on-chain voting was not the cause of the slowdown.\n\nThe community\u2019s reaction to the outage has been frantic, with some users calling the system a \u201ctransaction killer.\u201d\n\nHowever, the response to Yakovenko\u2019s improvement roadmap was mixed: some users said the news was \u201cfantastic,\u201d while others questioned Solana\u2019s integrity:\n\n\u201cYour testing process has failed with every major release. Do you at least have a real testing process? I\u2019m not sure. A simple question: who is responsible for the overall coordination of tests and releases so far? You? raj? \u2026 it\u2019s not serious.\u201d\n\nThe Solana ecosystem call is scheduled for 2 March 2023, where the state of the ecosystem, among other issues, will be discussed.\n\nOn 27 March, Helium Network\u2018s communication protocol plans to migrate to Solana\u2019s blockchain to distribute oracles.\n\nMore crypto news for Solana: \u201ctokenized\u201d homes\n\nThe company Homebase has sold the first NFTs \u201cbacked\u201d by real estate on Solana, allowing users to invest in real \u201ctokenized\u201d homes.\n\nSpecifically, a share of a three-bedroom apartment in McAllen, Texas, was sold with 2,468 NFTs on offer, with a total value of $246,000.\n\nUsers can invest through the program in single-family properties, with each of these to be held by a limited liability company. Moreover, the ownership of each property would be associated with Homebase\u2019s NFTs.\n\nAnd, when the home is rented out, the users (or rather the NFT holders) would receive the monthly income in the form of USDC, in proportion to the asset being owned. This is a way, according to the company, to enable more people to invest in the sector, which is very often exclusive given the liquidity needed to operate in it.\n\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, according to the releases, NFTs would be issued and registered under the SEC, and thus considered \u201csecurities\u201d under the agency\u2019s regulations.\n\nAlex Kim, co-founder of Homebase, stated the following:\n\n\u201cWe have decided to take one of the more prudent legal approaches. And we decided to register our assets as \u2018securities\u2019 from day one.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time such an operation has seen the light of day. Already last year, for example, Vesta Equity decided to sell similar products on Algorand, but the business did not seem to attract new investment.\n\nBy contrast, Roofstock onChain, a real estate NFT marketplace, has been more successful, recording the sale of a property in South Carolina last October, valued at $175,000."

However, BTC still appears somewhat weak and will require recovery to make a significant move in the upcoming days. In contrast, Ethereum saw a 2 percent increase over the previous day and traded between the $1,613 and $1,650 levels. The immediate support for ETH is at the $1,600 and $1,550 levels, while resistance is at the $1,670 level.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum prices are not expected to undergo any major changes in the coming days. France continues its efforts to lead the crypto regulation efforts of the EU with tighter legislation for new crypto firms that will enter the market. Hong Kong\u2019s evolving stance on crypto and consequent steps to introduce digital assets in the country is being actively supported by China. It is believed that Beijing is treating Hong Kong as a sandbox for crypto adoption amidst its own conflicted take on the asset.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cSilvergate Capital Corporation's stock price dropped severely after the bank disclosed that it may be subject to inquiries from the Department of Justice (DOJ), congressional committees, and bank regulators. This highlights the increased scrutiny that the crypto industry is currently facing from regulators and lawmakers. Previously the crackdown wasn't this steep on the traditional finance side of the ecosystem, but the current movements suggest the near-term focus is going to be the rails between traditional finance and digital assets.\"\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market remained flat due to unchanged macroeconomic factors in the last 24 hours. BTC and ETH showed a marginal jump in their value and are trading at $23,516.89 and $1,649.09 respectively. Australian central banks have experessed its willingness to explore the use of CBDC in the country and being a commonwealth realm, it may have a larger impact on the CBDC plans of other commonwealth members.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Solana is one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains on the market today. This has attracted a number of promising projects to build on Solana, and the platform has also attracted many users that have been priced out of Ethereum due to its high transaction fees.\n\nSo, how fast is Solana exactly? Solana is handling over 5,000 transactions per second in real-world scenarios, but has reached as high as 65,000 TPS during testing.\n\nIn this article, we will be taking at the Solana TPS figures and how Solana stacks up against other popular blockchains in terms of performance. We will also be looking at some future developments that will improve the scalability of Solana.\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nSolana is a blockchain platform with support for smart contracts. The project was founded in 2017 by software engineer Anatoly Yakovenko. Thanks to its high throughput and low costs, Solana is positioning itself as the underlying infrastructure for blockchain-based applications that are targeting a large userbase or need to handle a large number of transactions in a short period of time (for example, high-performance decentralized crypto exchanges).\n\nIn contrast to Ethereum, which is meant to scale through layer 2 solutions, Solana is designed to reach sufficient scalability at its base layer. Solana implements a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and enhances it through a Proof-of-History timestamping function.\n\nSolana is already very scalable, especially when compared to other blockchains available today. You\u2019ll be paying less than $0.001 per transaction, and you can expect it to be completed in about 5 seconds. In fact, Solana is one of the cheapest cryptocurrencies to transfer today.\n\nWhile Solana provides a very fast and low-cost alternative to Ethereum, the network has struggled with reliability. Solana has seen outages much more frequently than its competitors, and this is definitely an area where Solana will need to regain the crypto community\u2019s trust.\n\nIn Solana, updates related to staking happen in \u201cepochs\u201d. In other words\u2014staking, unstaking, and the distribution of staking rewards happens when the current Solana epoch ends and a new epoch starts. One epoch typically lasts between 2-3 days, but the exact length depends on how long the block times are in each epoch. At the time of writing, the Solana blockchain is in its 417th epoch and has a block height of about 163.5 million.\n\nSolana TPS\u2014How many transactions per second can Solana handle?\n\nPer the Solana whitepaper, Solana is theoretically capable of handling up to 710,000 transactions per second. Moving away from theoretical targets, we can point out that Solana\u2019s transactions per second peaked at around 65,000 during testing.\n\nWhile these figures are interesting, how many transactions per second is Solana actually handling in the real world? In practice, Solana is handling between 5,000 and 10,000 transactions per second, according to data from Solana Compass. The actual figure fluctuates quite a bit on a block-by-block basis depending on demand. If you wish to see the current Solana TPS, you can find the relevant information on most Solana explorers.\n\nRaw Solana TPS data over an 1 hour period. Image source: Solana Compass.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat to these figures. This is because the raw TPS metric doesn\u2019t just count standard Solana transactions, but also includes vote transactions submitted by validators. Still, Solana is easily among the most performant blockchains on the market today when it comes to the number of transactions it can handle per second.\n\nSolana is expected to scale even further in the future\n\nWhile we can see that Solana is already able to process a large number of transactions per second, the platform\u2019s scalability is expected to improve even further in future.\n\nOne project that could help Solana massively improve its scalability is Firedancer. Firedancer is a Solana validator client being developed by high-frequency trading firm Jump using the C++ programming language. According to Firedancer developers, the client is theoretically capable of processing up to 600,000 transactions per second.\n\nJump Trading claims that Solana\u2019s throughput is currently not bound by hardware limitations, but software inefficiencies. The company aims to use its experience at the cutting edge of the high-frequency trading industry to create a Solana validator client that operates at the very limits of what the currently available hardware can handle.\n\nFiredancer will also contribute to the effective decentralization of Solana by providing an alternative validator client to the one created by Solana Labs. A greater variety of clients used by validator nodes means that bugs and vulnerabilities in one implementation have less impact on the network as a whole.\n\nSolana TPS versus other blockchains\n\nAs we\u2019ve already mentioned, Solana\u2019s TPS figures are very impressive when compared to other blockchains. Let\u2019s check out exactly how Solana stacks up against other popular layer 1 blockchain platforms in terms of throughput.\n\nBlockchain Transactions per second (TPS) Solana 65,000 TPS* Polygon 7,000 TPS* Avalanche 4,500 TPS* XRP 1,500 TPS Cardano 250 TPS Litecoin 50 TPS Ethereum 30 TPS Bitcoin 7 TPS\n\n*Achieved in testing.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014Solana is one of the fastest blockchains available today\n\nWhether you are trading NFTs on Solana or participating on the platform\u2019s decentralized finance apps, you\u2019ll be enjoying low fees and fast transactions. Solana\u2019s transactions per second figure can easily go into the thousands.\n\nTo be frank, the maximum number of transactions Solana can process is not really relevant for everyday users, as it can handle the current level of demand without too many issues. However, it\u2019s good to know that Solana will likely be able to tackle the load even if blockchain is adopted by a much greater number of people in the future.\n\nSolana\u2019s scalability is one of the biggest reasons why Solana has a good chance of recovering from the crash it saw in 2022."

        "content": "Blockchain engineer and Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko has an estimated net worth of more than $200 million. It is worth noting that his actual net worth could be substantially higher or lower, as there is little public information available regarding the scope of his crypto and traditional investments.\n\nWho is Anatoly Yakovenko?\n\nYakovenko is a software engineer and founder of the Solana cryptocurrency. Image source: Solana Labs\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko is a co-founder and CEO of Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform. Born in Ukraine in 1981, Yakovenko moved to the United States in the early 1990s. It was at this time that Yakovenko learned C, his first programming language.\n\nDuring his college years amidst the height of the dot-com boom, Yakovenko was enamored by breakthrough software innovations and dreamed of \u201cbecoming the next Steve Jobs or Bill Gates,\u201d according to a Fortune interview. Yakovenko has a strong background in computer science and engineering, having previously worked as a software engineer at companies such as Qualcomm and Dropbox.\n\nYakovenko has been closely involved in the blockchain industry for several years and has worked on various projects related to blockchain scalability and performance. In 2017, Yakovenko founded Solana, a high-performance layer 1 blockchain that boasts smart contract and decentralized applications (dApps) support and is capable of facilitating up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nYakovenko is also an avid poker player, having scored several notable finishes throughout his gambling career, including a win in the $25,000 No-Limit Hold\u2019em 6-Handed Championship in 2010 for roughly $1.3 million and a first-place finish in the 2005 Festa Al Lago III No-Limit Hold\u2019em Championship for $700,000.\n\nWhat is Anatoly Yakovenko\u2019s net worth in 2023?\n\nAccording to numerous online publications, Anatoly Yakovenko has an estimated net worth of $200 million. However, some sources claim the Ukrainian-born software engineer could have a billion-dollar net worth, although the veracity of these claims is questionable.\n\nGiven his early involvement in Solana, it is safe to assume that Yakovenko received a significant share of SOL tokens during the Solana token sale. While it is not known how many tokens he received, we do know that the founders of the Solana project received a 25% share of 500M+ SOL tokens.\n\nSOL was initially sold to investors for 22 cents in 2020. The token quickly gained traction among crypto investors and reached an all-time high north of $259 in November 2021. While the token lost a significant chunk of its value since then, SOL is currently still trading more than 100x above its token sale price.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s collapse of FTX, which was one of the main backers of Solana, some investors and many in the crypto community proclaimed the project \u201cdead\u201d.
