        "title": "Why Solana, Polygon and Aptos expect the enterprise to drive mass adoption - TechCrunch",
        "content": "There are a number of blockchains out there competing for market share. Some chains are generalists with a focus on growing the greater ecosystem, while others focus on scaling or changing the financial landscape.\n\nEven as a handful of the big ones compete for the top slot, some think that working together toward a multichain world could be the answer to the bigger problems in the space.\n\n\u201cA multichain world makes it much easier for us to start moving the technology forward,\u201d Grace Torrellas, VP of product and product lead at Polygon zkEVM, said during a panel at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023. Polygon is a layer-2 blockchain, which means it\u2019s focused on scaling, in this case, the layer-1 blockchain Ethereum. \u201cWe are building an ecosystem of multichains that will be interoperable.\u201d\n\nMo Shaikh, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Aptos Labs, agreed. \u201cI do think it\u2019s a multichain world for sure. I think we\u2019re starting to see the deep work that all of us have done really come to fruition.\u201d\n\nWhile that may be a view some blockchains have, others don\u2019t feel the same.\n\n\u201cTo keep things spicy, I\u2019ll say there\u2019s going to be a single chain,\u201d said Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Solana, explaining that there\u2019s going to be a single execution environment, so it won\u2019t really matter how many other settlement environments there are. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which bank USDC actually settles in, but what matters is where all the peer-to-peer or merchant-to-consumer transactions occur.\u201d\n\nStressing that he\u2019s not saying so only to be a contrarian, Yakovenko added it\u2019s a real possibility because the main purpose for blockchains today is to move all crypto transactions, and a large portion of financial transactions, into one \u201csingle unified layer-1\u201d chain.\n\n\u201cWithin 20 years, we are going to see 1,000x improvement in hardware, so we\u2019re gonna see 1,000x more capacity on a layer-1 that\u2019s a single giant atomics state machine,\u201d Yakovenko added. \u201cSo you can imagine that you can fit everything into one place, and usually, things are cheaper and faster and kind of more composable when they\u2019re in one place.\u201d\n\nWhile having everything in one place sounds nice, I think it could be a bit too . . . unified. Let\u2019s take Google as an example: Sure, we use Google\u2019s search engine, email, cloud storage and other services, but I don\u2019t want it to be my banking app, too. We look to Google for a number of things and use other companies\u2019 products for others . . . and that\u2019s okay.\n\nIt\u2019s important to make sure that each chain offers a use case that is well prepared for that particular chain, Torrellas said. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s where the users will have better possibilities to interact in a blockchain space or in web3 space. Not just thinking about how I can bridge assets to this network versus another network, but just going there and having a seamless continuity within the network. We call it an unlimited blockspace.\u201d\n\nAn example of such a focused blockchain is Sei, a layer-1 blockchain that\u2019s focused on trading and not built as a general-purpose network that developers can build on top of. The team at Sei comprises former employees from Goldman Sachs, Databricks, Robinhood, Google and Nvidia, which is fairly fitting given the chain\u2019s focus.\n\nEnterprise growth\n\nWhether or not one believes blockchains should be focused on a multichain world, we\u2019re seeing multichain integrations happening at both crypto-focused companies and mainstream big name brands.\n\n\u201cI do think that distribution from large enterprises has been interesting; they\u2019ve all dipped their toes, they\u2019ve all experimented in previous protocols, but they just don\u2019t feel comfortable with the infrastructure being where it needs to be,\u201d Shaikh said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen hints of product-market fit in some applications, but nothing has actually been sustainable for the long term.\u201d\n\nThis is where leaning into enterprises makes a lot of sense, he added.\n\nIn the payments space, MasterCard has teamed up with a number of blockchain-focused foundations like Aptos, Polygon and Solana to bring the set of standards to developers in each ecosystem. Aptos has integrated its technology with companies like Microsoft, NBCUniversal and Coinbase Pay to grow its ecosystem and improve technologies for those businesses. And last month, Solana integrated its plug-in with Shopify to offer USDC payments.\n\n\u201cI think the industry has gotten a lot better with its attempts to build credible things that get to market, to consumers,\u201d Yakovenko said.\n\nPolygon is no stranger to big brand adoption either. It has partnered with brands like Disney, Reddit and Starbucks, to name a few, which expands the blockchain\u2019s exposure to a bigger demographic while also potentially making the technology more accessible. \u201cEnterprise partnerships are big at Polygon, and this is something that has made us really just go over that sort of chasm,\u201d Torrellas said.\n\nAs more large enterprises enter the crypto space, there\u2019s potential for \u201cnot only millions of users, but billions of users using web3 without having to even realize it,\u201d Shaikh said.\n\nThe next wave\n\nLooking to the future, some companies are wondering whether the next big killer use case and mass adoption will come from a crypto-native company or through a big brand adopting the technology.\n\nThe general sentiment from the panelists was that it would be the former.\n\n\u201cI generally focus on crypto-native companies to be the disruptors,\u201d Yakovenko said.\n\nTorrellas echoed that comment: \u201cI think the next wave of disruption is definitely going to be within crypto. There isn\u2019t an appetite for traditional companies or web2 companies to change their business models too much.\u201d\n\nIndeed, that\u2019s where it seems likely for blockchain technology to come in. Why would a company like Disney craft its own blockchain infrastructure when it can easily use a network developed by professionals within the industry?\n\nThat\u2019s not to say enterprises aren\u2019t thinking about it, though.\n\n\u201cWe do feel there is interest in enterprises bubbling up in a very aggressive way in the background,\u201d Shaikh said. \u201cIt may not appear that way today, but there are companies that are building some very interesting products that I\u2019d love to talk about in the future.\u201d\n\nThe companies, whether in the crypto space or not, that will take the lead will be the ones that disrupt themselves, Shaikh said. \u201cThink about Netflix. They used to mail DVDs to your house and they realized this doesn\u2019t work.\u201d The company could have flatlined or collapsed, but instead it changed its model and now has a market cap of $170 billion.\n\n\u201cLarge enterprises are absolutely willing to disrupt themselves,\u201d Shaikh added."
