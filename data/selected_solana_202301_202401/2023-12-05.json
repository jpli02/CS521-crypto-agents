        "content": "On-chain data shows that a wallet address linked to FTX has been unstaking millions of dollars-worth of SOL and transferring it to crypto exchange Coinbase.\n\nBankrupt crypto exchange FTX appears to be making moves with its massive stash of Solana\u2019s native token SOL.\n\nBlockchain transaction monitor Lookonchain identified a series of transactions on Monday, where a wallet address associated with FTX unstaked 1.5 million SOL worth $90 million and transferred it to another address.\n\nThat address then deposited 4.13 million SOL worth close to $250 million to crypto exchange Coinbase, presumably with the intention to sell.\n\n1/ FTX-related address \"4Axqyo\u2026HswTAh\" unstaked 1.5M $SOL($90M) 2 hours ago and transferred it to \"3vxheE\u20265mgkom\". And we noticed that \"3vxheE\u20265mgkom\" deposited 4.13M $SOL($248.67M) to #Coinbase 11 hours ago. pic.twitter.com/pQRNDZCvgy \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2023\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, the wallet that unstaked the SOL is likely connected to FTX based on a number of high value transfers it has received from a cold storage exchange wallet belonging to the crypto exchange.\n\nHolders of SOL have been bracing for impact after FTX received court approval in September to sell $3.4 billion worth of its crypto holdings, of which $1.16 billion is made up of SOL.\n\nDespite the sell pressure from FTX presumably offloading these assets, the price of SOL has managed to stay afloat so far. Over the last two months, the price of SOL has risen from $20 to $60.\n\nWith Solana largely being associated with FTX, the blockchain itself was hit hard following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s empire. Some protocols lost 80% of the value locked into them as DeFi traders began exiting their positions en masse.\n\nHowever, things have taken a turn for the better of late, and the Solana ecosystem has recovered considerably. Data from DeFiLlama shows that the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Solana blockchain has doubled over the last two months to $680 million at the time of writing."

        "content": "Former ParaFi Capital partner Santiago Santos said Solana could flip Ethereum in the next crypto market cycle.\n\nThe web3 investor said there is a 25% probability that SOL flips Ethereum.\n\nSolana trades at $59.90, losing around 3% on the day.\n\nIn a recent episode of the Empire podcast, Santiago Santos, former Partner at ParaFi Capital, shares his views on how Solana\u2019s market capitalization could exceed Ethereum\u2019s in the next market cycle.\n\nSantos\u2019 views are shaped by expectations of higher capital inflows in the crypto ecosystem, and a larger share for Solana funds.\n\nAlso read: Ripple transaction count exceeds 1.38 million, XRP price likely to extend gains\n\nSolana could flip Ethereum if these conditions are met\n\nSantos recalls his investment in Ethereum and says that when he first purchased ETH, he did not imagine the altcoin\u2019s market capitalization would climb to billions. At the time of writing, ETH market capitalization is $274.51 billion, and Solana is at a $25.51 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko data. ETH price slowly and consistently increased as capital inflows to altcoin climbed and Ethereum funds received capital from institutional investors.\n\nSantos\u2019 argument is that an increase in funding in Solana could help the altcoin flip Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization. The former ParaFi Capital partner explains that the overall crypto market capitalization does not need to increase necessarily. Instead, capital rotation from Ethereum and the ETH ecosystem\u2019s Layer 2 protocols to Solana and the SOL ecosystem could help drive the change.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap doesn\u2019t need to shrink for Solana to flip Ethereum, he said. With its various use cases and boost in utility, SOL and its ecosystem could emerge as a relatively profitable avenue for investment and draw capital from retail and institutional investors in the next crypto market cycle.\n\nSantiago Santos said that the probability of SOL flipping ETH is at 25%. Santos has entertained the idea of selling all his Ether and buying SOL tokens in exchange. The Web3 investor is firm in his thesis of Solana flipping Ethereum in the near future."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market has rebounded strongly in 2023, with a market cap exceeding $1.6 trillion and major assets like Bitcoin and Ether achieving significant gains.\n\nBonk Inu (BONK), a Solana-based memecoin, reached an all-time high on December 4, possibly benefiting from the overall bullish market trend, suggesting potential for further rallies.\n\nBONK\u2019s success could be partly attributed to its association with Solana (SOL), which has seen substantial growth recently. Analyst Jacob Canfield predicts SOL could reach $1,000, potentially becoming the second-largest crypto asset after Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nBONK Catches the Green Wave in the Market\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector has risen like a phoenix this year, clearing most of the losses registered during the devastating 2022. The global crypto market cap has recently surged above $1.6 trillion (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), while most of the leading digital assets have charted substantial gains.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) hit $42,000 for the first time in 19 months, Ether (ETH) surpassed $2,200, while Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and others have also been in the green.\n\nOne token that might have benefited from the highly bullish environment is Bonk Inu (BONK), whose price hit an all-time high on December 4. Currently, it trades quite close to the peak, meaning a new rally might be in the cards.\n\n\n\nSolana\u2019s Role\n\nAnother factor playing a role in BONK\u2019s uptrend could be its connection with Solana. The memecoin is described as the first Solana-dog cryptocurrency \u201cfor the people, by the people.\u201d\n\nSOL has been a top-performing crypto asset in the past few months, with its valuation climbing to almost $70 in mid-November. It currently hovers around the $60 level, with some analysts expecting a bull run in the near future.\n\nThe X (Twitter) user Jacob Canfield laid out an extremely optimistic forecast in November, suggesting SOL might explode to $1,000 and become the second-largest crypto asset after BTC.\n\nAt the time of this writing, however, Solana, much like other major altcoins, is falling behind BTC in terms of gains. Analysts are optimistic on an upcoming altseason once the Bitcoin price settles down and begins consolidating."

        "content": "Hashflow will source quotes for trade execution from third-party DEXes and pro market makers\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi\n\nHashflow, a decentralized exchange offering trade execution via professional market makers, launched the initial stage for its 2.0 iteration on Dec. 5, introducing DEX aggregation services for the first time.\n\nHashflow 2.0 debuts Smart Order Routing\u201d (SOR), allowing traders to access more than $8B worth of liquidity across top decentralized exchanges including Uniswap, Curve, Sushi, and Balancer, in addition to its network of institutional market makers.\n\nHashflow will execute transactions using third-party decentralized exchanges when the network of market makers cannot provide a better quote than rival DEXes. The protocol offers user orderflow to market makers via its Request-for-Quote (RFQ) process.\n\n\u201cOther cross-chain aggregation services in DeFi will directly route to external liquidity, while Hashflow will use SOR to leverage its RFQ technology to offer better prices,\u201d Varun Kumar, Hashflow\u2019s co-founder and CEO, told The Defiant. \u201cWith this core update, we provide traders access to the deepest liquidity and best rates in decentralized trading.\u201d\n\nHashflow drove more than $10M worth of trades over the past 24 hours, ranking it as the 32nd most-active DEX, according to DeFi llama. Ethereum hosted 83.5% of volume over the past 24 hours. The platform has settled more than $17.6B worth of trades since its April 2021 launch.\n\nHashflow\u2019s RFQ-based trading offers the platform a point of difference within the saturated decentralized exchange sector, which is largely populated by forks of the pioneering automated market-maker DEX, Uniswap.\n\nHashflow full 2.0 release will launch via a staged rollout. Initially, SOR aggregation will exclusively be available on the Ethereum mainnet, before deployment to Solana and Ethereum L2s Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. The exchange is also live on the alternative Layer 1s BNB Chain and Avalanche.\n\nThe Solana launch will comprise Hashflow\u2019s first deployment on a non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) network. The launch will facilitate cross-chain trades for \u201cblue-chip\u201d assets between Ethereum and Solana without incurring the third-party risks associated with cross-chain bridging protocols.\n\nHashflow\u2019s RFQ mechanism fetches quotes from market makers who manage the liquidity pools on the Hashflow platform. Market makers cryptographically sign quotes to ensure they remain unchanged to protect against slippage, also preventing front-running and sandwich attacks from MEV bots."
