        "content": "The locally-owned Oolong Gallery will host a pop-up art exhibition in a warehouse on Encinitas\u2019 Second Street this month. An opening reception will be held on Saturday, Dec. 2 from 2-7 p.m. during the Encinitas Holiday Parade at the Glass Building at 687 Second Street.\n\nA poster for the newest Oolong Gallery show. (Eric Laine)\n\nEric Laine, a Cardiff resident who has worked in the contemporary art world for 20 years, opened his Oolong Gallery in Solana Beach last summer. He is now moving up the coast and continuing to hold shows in \u201cannex\u201d spaces in Encinitas.\n\n\u201cOolong Gallery is currently exploring new exhibition spaces for 2024 with higher ceilings and a wider audience. Solana Beach was great to us but change is a constant especially in the arts and business,\u201d Laine said. \u201cThese annex shows are a celebration of the first 15 months as an art gallery start-up that continues to catch the community by surprise after the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition opening on Dec. 2 will showcase artists Natalja Kent and Nick McPhail. Kent\u2019s \u201cLight Waves\u201d is an exhibition of chromograms and sculptures reflecting the surf and ocean activist\u2019s exploration of the process, color, embodiment and the ocean. McPhail is a painter and sculptor \u201cusing renaissance techniques to consider the peripheral mundanity of urban life.\u201d\n\nThe show will be on display through Jan. 14, 2024.\n\nOolong\u2019s next show will be a group show with several artists, a salon and a sculpture garden at a second annex location at Sota at The Brown Studio in Encinitas. The show is slated for Feb. 3, 2024 at the studio, located at 1144 N. Coast Highway 101.\n\nTo learn more visit oolongallery.com\n\n"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nCrypto data tracker Whale Alert detects major whale transfers for the seventh largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Solana (SOL).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last 24 hours, over 2.1 million Solana coins were moved in three transactions. First, 899,999 SOL worth $50,456,212 were transferred between unknown wallets. In another move, 900,000 SOL valued at $50,465,194 were transferred between unknown wallets. Then an unknown whale transferred 336,999 SOL worth $19,100,615 to the Coinbase crypto exchange.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 900,000 #SOL (50,465,194 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/BFkE74MUew \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 27, 2023\n\nThe exact reasons for the token shifts remain unknown, but it is possible to draw inferences from the destination to which they are being shifted.\n\nThe first two transactions, which entail moving to unknown wallets, may reflect those of an OTC, which occurs outside of a crypto exchange.\n\nThe most recent transaction that suggested a shift to a cryptocurrency exchange, notably Coinbase, may have suggested selling, which is one of the reasons tokens are moved to exchanges.\n\nIs reversal on horizon?\n\nAfter soaring roughly 450% year to date, Solana is facing a price pullback. SOL was down 4.75% in the last 24 hours to $55 at the time of writing, down 19% from recent highs of $68.18.\n\nThe 24-hour drop matches similar movements in the crypto market, with major coins Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) down 1.47% and 2.46%, respectively, in this span.\n\nSolana's attempt to break past the $69 level was rebuffed by the bears. If this level is successfully breached, Solana might aim for new yearly highs targeting $75 next.\n\nIn contrast to this notion, if the price falls from its current level, the bears will attempt to break through the strong support at $51, from where the SOL price has rallied twice in recent weeks. If they succeed, Solana may fall to $48, where buyers are likely to enter."
