        "content": "The surge started after a favorable tweet by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who expressed \u201chope\u201d that the Solana community \u201cgets its fair chance to thrive\u201d in a tweet, shortly after SOL had plunged to a record low of $8.19. Buterin\u2019s comment headed off damage from reports that the token was the second-largest holding of Alameda Research, the trading arm of FTX whose unruly balance sheet sparked FTX\u2019s descent into bankruptcy protection, although SOL had already declined significantly prior to the FTX revelation."

        "content": "A new annual report from early-stage venture firm Electric Capital shows massive developer activity growth on four blockchain projects, including two Ethereum (ETH) rivals.\n\nAccording to the firm, active developers on the Polygon (MATIC) and Cosmos (ATOM) blockchains along with ETH rivals Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) shot up in 2022 by more than 400% from five years ago.\n\nSays Maria Shen, an investor at Electric Capital,\n\n\u201cWhile prices are at 2018 levels, developer ecosystems are multiples bigger.\u201d\n\nThese four blockchain projects each saw less than 200 monthly developers in 2018, but that increased to more than 1,000 in 2012.\n\nAccording to the report, Polygon has just over 1,000 monthly active developers, Cosmos just under 2,000, Polkadot about 2,000 and Solana about 2,250.\n\nIn the crypto space as a whole, developer activity started off at 1,000 monthly active developers writing code in the first seven years of the nascent technology. Now, as of December 2022, there were 23,343 monthly active developers, a 5% growth compared to December 2021, the report says.\n\nDevelopment activity on a blockchain is one indicator that a crypto project will experience a price increase.\n\nSays the report,\n\n\u201cDevelopers are a leading indicator of value creation. Developers build apps that deliver value to users. Killer apps attract customers, and those customers bring more developers.\u201d\n\nShen says the firm\u2019s development activity tally is likely an undercount since it solely tracks open-source code.\n\n\u201cWe focus on open source code, so we undercount total developers in crypto and do not count designers, community mods, PMs [project managers], etc. We focus on unique code and do not count forked code.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
