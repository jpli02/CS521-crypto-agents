        "content": "Following other Solana memecoins, WEN aims to immortalize a popular part of a crypto culture centered on timelines and milestones.\n\nThe WEN token skyrocketed over 4,000% from launch on Jan. 26, racing above a $50 million market capitalization less than 12 hours after its debut on Solana\u2019s ecosystem. WEN was airdropped to users of the decentralized exchange Jupiter.\n\nTo claim the free tokens, Jupiter users must have traded at least $5 in volume between July 2023 and January. The six-month qualification period ended at midnight UTC on Jan. 19 when a snapshot was taken. According to WEN\u2019s launch page, tokens unclaimed by Jan. 29 will be burned.\n\nWEN is inspired by a fractionalized NFT poem written by pseudonymous developer Weremeow, one of the minds behind Jupiter exchange and other Solana-native dapps like Meteora. The Ovals team manages the cryptocurrency and was launched via Jupiter\u2019s launchpad platform dubbed LFG.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/weremeow/status/1738590330805719289?s=20\n\nYou might also like: Jupiter tokens to drop in January 2024 for Solana defi users\n\nOf WEN\u2019s one trillion supply, 70% was airdropped to eligible users who can earn trading fees by providing liquidity. Per the project\u2019s page, the idea is a community-backed salute to Weremeow and the common crypto question of when.\n\nThe term often refers to inquiries regarding when a token might launch, or a new feature might be shipped.\n\nWEN\u2019s launch comes ahead of a Jupiter airdrop likely slated for month\u2019s end and follows a frenzy of Solana memecoins toward the end of last year. Cryptos like BONK and dogwifhat were said to turn speculators into overnight millionaires.\n\nUsers bought in with small-sized capitals, sometimes turning a few bucks into thousands of dollars in profits.\n\nMemecoin mania is synonymous with each crypto cycle, usually leading into a bull run. However, caution is advised when dealing with altcoins dependent on community speculation rather than proven utility."

        "content": "Solana Network\u2019s co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, has confirmed the conditions the blockchain would meet before finally exiting the much-talked-about beta mode. According to a tweet on Friday, the Solana network would go full mainnet when \u201cfiredancer is stable and it\u2019s running as a safety check on mainnet.\u201d\n\nI know I\u2019ve said that it\u2019s the line for beta, but we should actually get serious about it. Beta ends when firedancer is stable and it\u2019s running as a safety check on mainnet. Safety of the state is paramount. https://t.co/AEtfqxVgcj \u2014 toly ???????? (@aeyakovenko) January 26, 2024\n\nThe revelation came in response to a tweet flaunting the stability of the Solana Network. The X user revealed that the blockchain has maintained an uptime of 336 days, 29 days shy of a full year without downtime.\n\nMainnet Finally?\n\nThe \u201cMainnet Beta\u201d phrase affiliated with the Solana Network had seen it receive less criticism during downtimes. However, the blockchain has shown appreciable stability amidst peak usage.\n\nThe Solana Network experienced zero downtime during the SOL\u2019s mini-bull run last year, surpassing daily and monthly transaction highs. At one point, SOL\u2019s DEX trading volume surpassed that of Ethereum and other layer-1 networks combined, but it maintained uptime and a reasonable transaction fee.\n\nDespite the positives, Yakovenko maintained that its independent client validator, Firedancer, must be more stable and run safety checks before Solana goes mainnet entirely. Solana introduced the Firedancer last year to boost the network\u2019s scalability, speed, and decentralization.\n\nWay to the Top?\n\nAlthough Solana suffered several setbacks during and after the Mainnet Beta 2 launch in 2020, it is on course to become one of the leading blockchains in the crypto sector. Solana\u2019s scalability has improved drastically and is second only to the Ethereum Network.\n\nWith Yakovenko stating at one time that he sees nothing holding developers from building layer-2s on Solana\u2019s blockchain, the network might be on track to greater scalability and stability and may finally match Ethereum toe-to-toe. However, Solana co-founder Raj Gokal insists he wants to see the second-largest crypto asset thrive."

        "content": "Solana (SOL) had an excellent 2023, shooting from $20 to above $120 in the second half of the year. And there has been considerable hype surrounding Solana-based coins.\n\nThe ecosystem is fast, low-cost, and scalable, making it a prime place for dApp development, and there has been a considerable amount of bullish Solana news regarding how the network is progressing in terms of partnerships and upgrades.\n\nHowever, after a 6x bull run, the chart suggests that it needs a break. This is a great time to consider alternatives, in our own words \u2018the next Solana.\u2019 It\u2019s not going to 6x again again time soon, while other coins might have a chance of doing so, even more than 6x.\n\nA broad Solana outlook for 2024 and 2025\n\nWe at InvestingHaven have a bullish outlook on Solana for 2024 and 2025. The network fundamentals are very strong and there is a lot of development going on within the ecosystem. Many new projects are choosing to develop on top of the Solana infrastructure, it scores well in speed, scalability, and cost, and it has impressive on-chain metrics.\n\nHowever, the price is exhausted in the short to medium term. We wrote about this extensively in the article about SOL being vulnerable to further downside. Within the article, we outlined how fundamentals are not always driving price and how a cooling period is inevitable for tokens that make rapid gains.\n\nThis is also precisely how we predicted the current Bitcoin price drop, as it had already experienced an increase and needed a cooling off period. This was to herald in a rising altcoin market over the next year. The charts back this view up \u2013 the graph below indicates an exhausted SOL price:\n\nMost likely, Solana is going to continue to hover between $72 \u2013 $120. It needs a consolidation period after experiencing such rapid expansion. Solana also offers support levels at $64, $72, and $80. While the coin is likely to experience further upside as 2024 progresses, there are far better buying opportunities. The time to buy Solana was when we recommended it to premium subscribers between $20 \u2013 $30.\n\nThree Solana alternatives with super upside\n\nThe following three charts indicate some of our top Solana alternatives that we give to dedicated subscribers. This is a 50x token by 2026, with a bullish falling wedge breakout followed by a bullish reversal:\n\nThis is a bullish rounded reversal followed by another wide bullish rounded reversal, with 10x potential by 2025.\n\nFinally, this is a bullish W-reversal followed by a bullish rounded reversal. It has a 6x upside potential by 2024.\n\nOnly a very small number of analysts with experience in the field are capable of interpreting these charts correctly. We excel at identifying specific chart setups that are hard for the untrained eye to understand. This allows us to find specific entry and exit points. In contrast, most headlines are created in saturated bull markets where most investors buy at a high and sell at a low.\n\nAfter all, hype is what sells \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to attract readers with headlines telling them about a sideways trading coin. People want to believe in 10x coins, which are notoriously difficult to pick out without significant expertise.\n\nThe \u2018next Solana\u2019 \u2013 tremendous upside potential\n\nThere are certainly many coins that outrank Solana in terms of upside, think of the upside potential that Solana had back in the summer of 2023. While it can still do well, it won\u2019t be 2024\u2019s top-performing asset. With the recent SOL price rise, it\u2019s entirely feasible that all the positive fundamental news is already priced in.\n\nAnd the 2023 price rise could have been driven, in large part, by the Solana-based meme coin frenzy (SPONGE, BONK, WIF, MYRO, etc). Moreover, Solana outperformed major cryptos in 2023 and must have a period of consolidation before embarking on another breakout.\n\nAs we have continually reiterated, periods of boring consolidation are what demark a major breakout. Bull runs only have so much steam before needing to revitalize and consolidate. If you want to see our picks that have 6x, 10x, and 50x potential in 2024, 2025, and 2026, then you\u2019ll need to join the premium service.\n\nUpon signup, you\u2019ll gain immediate access to top coins with alerts when a token is set to pump, based on what the charts are saying.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice.
