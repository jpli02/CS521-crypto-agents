        "content": "Pressure is growing for the crypto industry to take more accountability on blockchain-related emissions\u2019 contributions to the climate crisis. The Bitcoin blockchain especially has come under wide criticism among environmental advocates for the amount of energy needed to mine the cryptocurrency, and the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake network was partly motivated by the desire for a more energy-efficient system."

        "content": "According to on-chain sleuth Zachxbt, the official Twitter account of the Solana-based decentralized finance project Serum, which had over 200,000 followers, has been renamed \u2018Luka.\u2019\n\nThe original Serum account is speculated to have been sold to a different user since all the previous tweets have been deleted.\n\nSharing a screenshot of the account, ZachXBT revealed that its PFP avatar was replaced with Milady NFT and was used for promoting \u201cshitcoins.\u201d\n\nFor the uninitiated, Serum was founded in August 2020 by a consortium that included the Solana Foundation as well as the now-collapsed Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX and trading desk Alameda Research.\n\nSerum received funding from Multicoin Capital alongside FTX.com and FTX US.\n\nIt was once heralded as a core decentralized exchange platform and liquidity provider for Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe events leading up to FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing forced Solana DeFi projects like Raydium and Jupiter to cut off ties with Serum.\n\nSeveral exchanges, such as Upbit and Binance, delisted Serum from their platforms. Soon after, the project\u2019s native token \u2013 SRM \u2013 also lost over 98% of its value since its all-time high in September last year. It was assumed that the project ended.\n\nSubsequently, a community-driven fork of Serum\u2019s V3 program was launched and rebranded as \u2018OpenBook,\u2019 which has over 5k followers on its Twitter account."

Now, the developer turns its attentions to a follow-up project on an adjoining property to the east.\n\nLast week, MBK and R.D. Olson Construction announced the official start of work on Solana, the second phase of its new project on Fasana Road just east of Duarte Road. Plans call for the construction of a five-story building on a roughly 3.4-acre site, containing a total of 292 studio, one-, two-, three-, and four-bedroom apartments, wrapping around an eight-story parking garage.\n\nTCA Architects is designing Solana, which is depicted in a rendering as a contemporary wood-frame structure. the building is intended to have appeal to a mix of tenant types, including students, families, and empty nesters. Besides housing, plans call for amenities such as a swimming pool, a fitness center, and a club room.\n\nOutside of the building, the property will include an \"entertainment alleyway\" which can host food trucks and outdoor events. Pocket parks and a linear park with a dog area are also planned.\n\nThe project, which is being built by MBK in partnership with Haseko Corporation, is on pace to open in Summer 2024.\n\nSolana and Esperanza also sit across the L Line tracks from the 110-acre City of Hope campus, which is poised to undergo an expansion that will increase its patient capacity by 1,000 and its employment base by 1,500 through the 2030s.\n\nFollow us on social media:\n\nTwitter / Facebook / LinkedIn"

If my god ain\u2019t in it, I don\u2019t want it.

Naw, I\u2019m good. Salaam Alaikum.\u201d\n\nAD AD LOADING...\n\nSZA has previously expressed a devout belief in astrology, and back in 2019 asked her astrologer Jaadee to publish her full chart on Twitter. However, it\u2019s unclear if any of these issues were what caused SZA to block Jay Electronica on social media.\n\nThe elusive \u201cExhibit C\u201d lyricist is just one of several high-profile names on Swizz Beatz\u2019s new EP, which also features appearances from Nas, Lil Wayne, Jadakiss, Benny The Butcher, Lil Durk and A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.\n\nrelated news SZA Sends An Instagram Subliminal To Drake After He Leaked Their Alleged Business October 3, 2020\n\nThe six-track project comes courtesy of Mass Appeal\u2019s Hip Hop 50: The Soundtrack series and follows DJ Premier\u2019s similarly stacked Hip Hop 50: Vol. 1 EP which dropped last year.\n\nIn other Jay Electronica news, the the 46-year-old revealed in December that he\u2019s working on a joint album with Curren$y.\n\nAD AD LOADING...\n\nSpitta was hosting an Instagram Live with fans when Jay Elec popped up in the comments section to remind his fellow New Orleans native that their joint project still needs to be completed."
