Its staffers guided visitors through interactive stations that taught them how to get going on Solana, from setting up a crypto wallet to swapping tokens on a decentralized exchange. Norby later set up a second shop in Miami."

        "content": "Solana (SOL) experienced a surge in price following an announcement that Helium (HNT) would be migrating towards the platform beginning Mar. 27.\n\nIn a blog post from Feb., Helium announced the move.\n\n\u201cThe Network migration to the Solana blockchain and deployment of Oracles represents the most significant upgrade to Helium Network scalability and reliability.\u201d\n\nHelium\u2019s decentralized network of hotspots totals almost one million as of Feb. 2023.\n\nNews of the migration date sent the price of both tokens up last week. Following the news, Solana\u2019s value has seen an over 21% surge \u2014 to a high of $27.11 on Feb. 17, from $22.34 on Feb. 16.\n\nCurrently, SOL is worth $26.15 and Helium is trading for $3.15 at the time of writing.\n\nHelium is a network that focuses on creating an internet of things (IoT) powered by physical hotspots, with HNT tokens used to reward participants for validating coverage and providing wireless hotspots.\n\nThe migration of Helium from its current layer-1 (L1) solution to the Solana platform was recently announced by the Solana network \u2014 with the transition set to take place at the end of March.\n\nWith nearly one million hotspots worldwide across long range and 5G networks, the move is expected to help Helium\u2019s community to focus on expanding decentralized wireless networks.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Helium encouraged its users to prepare for the transition, stating that the migration to the Solana ecosystem will allow its community to focus on building wireless protocols and enabling utility on these networks.\n\nOnce completed, HNT will become natively compatible with other platforms within Solana\u2019s ecosystem, adding utility for HNT, MOBILE, and IoT token holders."

        "content": "Solana saw a bounce off $20 a week ago and added a $4 gain to its price. Half of this gain has been washed away in the past hours due to a bearish reaction. More losses are expected if the bulls fail to regroup.\n\nAs expected, Solana retested the $24.2 level following a 7-day recovery. This price level saw rejection yesterday with a bearish candle, which brought the price to a close of $22.3 \u2013 last week\u2019s breakdown level.\n\nThe asset has increased by a few cents today with a trading price of $22.5. The buyers are trying to push the price off that solid level. Even though they successfully advance the price, they could encounter hurdles around the channel\u2019s resistance at $26.7 \u2013 marked as a two-month high.\n\nA significant surge above the 9-month channel will take SOL completely out of the bear box and launch it into a bull run.\n\nIn the opposite direction, a continuous drop from the current trading level will trap the price more in the box. Such a scenario could make the price fall to as low as $11.\n\nSolana will continue to remain bearish in the long-term perspective as long as it continues to respect this descending channel. The price is still down by 80% in a year.\n\nSolana\u2019s Key Level To Watch Out For\n\nThe market structure reveals that SOL is still bullish on the daily chart. Retaking yesterday\u2019s rejection level, SOL will still need to flip the two-month high \u2013 a clear breakout of the channel \u2013 to validate a continuation of the bullish trend. The $30 and $33.5 resistance levels are key targets in case of a breakout.\n\nOn the downward range, last week\u2019s rebound level \u2013 $20 \u2013 remains a crucial support for a breakdown. Below it lies hidden support at $18.9 and $17.7 before slipping to $15.1.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $26.7, $30, $33.5\n\nKey Support Levels: $20, $17.7, $15.1\n\nSpot Price: $22.6\n\nTrend: Bullish\n\nVolatility: Moderate\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.
