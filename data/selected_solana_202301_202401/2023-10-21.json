        "title": "Solana\u2019s Strong Recovery in 2023: SOL vs ETH Ratio Hits Yearly Highs - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Solana had a strong association with FTX, and the latter\u2019s collapse last year had significant repercussions for the SOL token. However, the seventh-largest crypto-asset has pursued a strong recovery this year.\n\nAccording to Nansen\u2019s latest analysis, SOL has been trending positively since the summer. In fact, the SOL vs ETH ratio was found to have been breaking higher, nearing highs not seen all year.\n\nSince the collapse of FTX, SOL has declined more than ETH, meaning ETH has been the better coin to hold\u2026 But since summer, SOL has been trending positively, with the SOL vs ETH ratio breaking higher, nearing highs not seen all year Will this momentum continue? pic.twitter.com/aDhh0wY92q \u2014 Nansen \ud83e\udded (@nansen_ai) October 19, 2023\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the SEC filed regulatory complaints against Coinbase and Binance, both of which had listed SOL as a security alongside other assets.\n\nAs a result of these complaints, SOL experienced a significant 34% decrease in its price.\n\nHowever, the token rebounded stronger than the other assets identified as securities by the end of the second quarter and maintained that positive momentum into the third quarter.\n\nFollowing a brief decline, possibly attributed to the imminent liquidation of Alameda/FTX\u2019s SOL, the crypto asset closed the quarter with a market capitalization of $8.4 billion, reflecting a 17% increase quarter-over-quarter.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is SOL\u2019s outperformance compared to assets with similar market capitalization; it climbed from the 10th to the 7th position in market cap rank over the same quarter.\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s DeFi TVL increased 32% QoQ to $368 million, as a recent Messari report while the growth is fueled by DeFi and liquid staking protocols rolling out points programs, led by MarginFi, Jito, Cypher, and BlazeStake, among others.\n\nMoreover, the total revenue, including all fees accumulated by the protocol, jumped by 19% in USD and reached a whopping $4 million. This marked a 10% growth in SOL terms, amounting to 185,400 SOL.\n\nSolana transaction fees were found to be among the \u201csteadiest and cheapest\u201d of all networks.\n\nIn the third quarter, the average non-vote transaction fee was $0.0002."

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe crypto industry has displayed a robust bullish week as the top cryptocurrencies have gained a significant value in their price. Further, SOL price has outperformed elite coins by adding over 27% in value within a week.\n\nThe Solana price was seen trading in a closed range of $23.0 and $24.25 since the start of October, indicating a disinterest among the investors in the coin. The coin then experienced a dip in value, resulting in the price breaking down its support level.\n\nSOL coin then traded in a consolidated range between $21.17 and $23 for a week. During this period, the price attempted to break down its crucial support zone, but the bulls held the price firm. Following this, the coin gained momentum and broke out of its resistance level at $23 and continued to gain value but was rejected at $24.25.\n\nTradingView: SOL/USDT\n\nFurther, the price was seen hovering around the trendline for a while. Solana\u2019s price recently made another attempt to breakout of the critical resistance at $24.25 and successfully managed to breakout of it, igniting a bullish moment in the market.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin (DOGE) Struggles Around the Demand Zone: Is This a Good Buying Opportunity?\n\nSOL coin continued to gain momentum and broke out of its upper resistance at $26 soon after, but the price got rejected at $28.49, after which the price traded close to the level.\n\nSolana price has recently formed a rising channel pattern and is expected to test a breakout soon, of which the outcome is unpredictable.\n\nThe MACD displays a constant green histogram in its chart, indicating a massive ongoing price action for the coin. Further, the MACD and signal lines continue the positive trend, suggesting the price to continue gaining value in the coming days.\n\nIf the bulls manage to hold power and break out of the resistance level of $28.49, Soalna will regain momentum and run to test its upper resistance level of $30 soon. Further, if the bulls continue to gain momentum, it will continue to rise and test its yearly high of $32.2 in the coming days.\n\nConversely, if the bears overpowered the bulls and a trend reversal occurs, the price will lose momentum and fall to test its support level at $26. Moreover, if the bears continue to dominate the market, the price will experience another drop and will test its lower support level of $24.25 in the coming days."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSolana (SOL), the native cryptocurrency asset of the eponymous blockchain, is getting closer to testing a major pattern. If it succeeds, the road to a new 66% rally might be open, a seasoned macro investor says. His opinion is aligned with the ever-growing way of optimism regarding Solana (SOL).\n\nI have been extremely bullish on Solana (SOL) all this year: Investor Raoul Pal\n\nTop macro investor and market commentator Raoul Pal has been extremely bullish on Solana (SOL) all year. During this period, the asset's price added 171%. Also, there are some signs that the marvelous rally has all chances to expand, he added.\n\n$SOL - Ive been extremely bullish all year.\n\n\n\nIt's up 171% this year and we are about to test the big inverse head and shoulders at $30.... next major resistance would likely be $50, once confirmed. 1/ pic.twitter.com/2I0l92xFTR \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) October 20, 2023\n\nRight now, the Solana (SOL) price is about to test the big \"Inverse Head and Shoulders\" pattern. The first \"shoulder\" was registered in early Q2, 2022. The bottom of the pattern (\"head\") therefore took place in December 2022 amid the most painful phase of the post-FTX-collapse market depression.\n\nAs such, the ongoing \"shoulder\" stage might push Solana (SOL) to $50. However, to confirm this pattern closure, the SOL price needs to protect the $30 level.\n\nAlso, Pal noticed that Solana (SOL) performs well in pairs with both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\n\nIn October 2023, SOL/BTC and SOL/ETH charts broke out of bearish patterns almost simultaneously.\n\nYesterday, Oct. 20, 2023, the Solana (SOL) price stopped one step away from the coveted $30 level. At printing time, the asset is changing hands at $28.92, being 8.2% up in the last 24 hours.\n\nSolana (SOL) comeback in 2024?\n\nAs a result, Solana (SOL) might see a bright future in the midterm. In particular, Q2-Q3, 2024, might bring the best returns for Solana (SOL) bulls, Raoul Pal says:\n\nLet's see but it feels like SOL is going to lead us from Crypto Spring eventually into Crypto Summer in 2024\n\nHis statements are echoed by many analysts and investors. Blockchain researchers foresee that Solana (SOL) might repeat Ethereum's (ETH) performance in the next rally.\n\nIn particular, the Solana (SOL) ecosystem is going through an explosive growth phase in the segments of DeFi and NFT marketplaces.\n\nIn terms of technology, Solana's (SOL) parallelization concept might be attractive for dApps from Ethereum (ETH) as the second largest blockchain is lagging with sharding, investor Justin Bons says."
