        "content": "In a stunning twist, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, has opted to remove a trading pair involving Solana (SOL) from its offerings. The delisting decision pertains to the perpetual futures linked to Binance's native stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD), and is scheduled for Aug. 28.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimultaneously, Binance is reducing the maximum leverage for this trading instrument. During the interim period leading to the delisting, the leverage will be halved, capped at 10x. Notably, even investors who held positions before the announcement are not exempt from these changes.\n\nPurge continues\n\nThis move is part of Binance's recent series of actions aimed at streamlining its operations. The exchange has undertaken a systematic cleanup, targeting pairs linked to BUSD, like Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE), earlier this month. Additionally, instruments with regulatory concerns, such as leveraged tokens linked to Cardano (ADA), have also faced cuts.\n\nThis trend can be traced back to the intensified regulatory scrutiny Binance is currently navigating, particularly from the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the SEC. Throughout the year, the exchange has faced multiple high-profile investigations, ushering in a period of contention.\n\nAdding to the saga, Binance has recently halted Euro (EUR) withdrawals and deposits for its European users utilizing the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) system. The suspension, which leaves users without a clear timeline for accessing their funds, has raised eyebrows among industry experts. John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, expressed his concerns on Twitter, suggesting that regulatory authorities should investigate the matter closely."

        "content": "Dogecoin flipped Solana on 18 August to reclaim its 8th spot on the list of top cryptos.\n\nThough a few metrics were bullish on SOL, market indicators suggested otherwise.\n\nOver the last week,the market capitalizations of Dogecoin [DOGE] and Solana [SOL] were closely knit. This allowed both tokens to flip each other on multiple occasions. A few days ago, SOL flipped DOGE to become the eighth largest crypto. However, the good days did not last long, as DOGE quickly reclaimed its spot. The reason behind this episode was revealed upon a look at their metrics and daily charts.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nSolana and Dogecoin are neck-to-neck\n\nA look at both the cryptos\u2019 market caps revealed that there were several instances when both flipped each other over the last week. Though the difference in their prices was massive, their market caps remained close to each other, with only a slight difference of a few thousand dollars.\n\nAccording to CoinMakretCap, at the time of writing, Solana had a market cap of $8.828 billion, while Dogecoin\u2019s market cap was $9 billion, giving it the edge.\n\nA look at the market sentiment around both tokens clearly pointed out that DOGE was the leader. This was evident from the drop in SOL\u2019s weighted sentiment, while the same metric for DOGE remained high.\n\nDogecoin last flipped Solana on 18 August to claim its spot. The 4-hour chart of DOGE showed what helped the memecoin.\n\nDuring that time frame, DOGE\u2019s MACD displayed a bullish crossover. Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a sharp uptick, helping the coin to marginally increase its value.\n\nWill Solana be able to beat DOGE?\n\nWhile DOGE\u2019s price went up by more than 1% in the last 24 hours, SOL only managed to push its price up by 0.18%. Nonetheless, a few of the metrics were bullish on SOL, suggesting a further price uptick in the days to follow.\n\nAs per Santiment\u2019s chart, SOL\u2019s open interest dropped substantially. A decline in the metric usually means that the on-going price trend might end soon. Moreover, Solana\u2019s DyDx and Binance funding rates were red, further increasing the chances of a trend reversal.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Dogecoin Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, a look at SOL\u2019s daily chart painted a bearish picture. The distance between the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 55-day EMA was shrinking, indicating a possible bearish crossover soon.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also resting below the neutral mark. This meant that the chances of SOL going ahead of DOGE in the near term were unlikely. Nonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick, which was a bullish development."
