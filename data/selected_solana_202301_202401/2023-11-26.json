        "content": "Solana Price Prediction: Amid the increasing uncertainty in the crypto market, the Solana price has been trading sideways within two horizontal levels of $67 and $51.5. These levels are tested twice and indicate no dominance from buyers or sellers. However, as per the Fibonacci retracement level, this correction lies within a zone of healthy retracement, indicating a higher potential of bouncing back.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Solana (SOL) Makes History With About 51M Surge in Daily Transactions\n\nadvertisement\n\nA Healthy Retracement May Prolong Recovery\n\nRounding bottom pattern governs a recovery trend in Solana price\n\nThe falling price may find suitable support of $51 and $42.5.\n\nThe 24-hour trading volume on the Solana coin is $793 Million, indicating a 34% loss.\n\nSource-Tradingview\n\nThe daily chart indicates that the Solana price recovery is aligning with a rounding bottom pattern, a bullish indicator that often signifies sustainable growth and suggests that the asset may have established a solid bottom from which to reverse its trend.\n\nFollowing this pattern, and aided by a broader market recovery, the SOL price began to regain momentum from mid-October, bouncing back from the $20 mark. This recovery saw the coin price rally by nearly 225% over five weeks, reaching a high of $67.43.\n\nHowever, the price faced a reversal at this point, coinciding with a significant sell-off in the market. Notably, during its ongoing rally, the SOL price has experienced several such pullbacks, typically retracing to the 38.2% or 50% Fibonacci levels.\n\nCurrently, the Solana coin is trading around $57, and as long as it maintains above the 50% Fibonacci level (around $42), there remains an opportunity for a bullish resurgence. If the bullish trend does resume, the prices could potentially ascend towards targets of $78.2, followed by $100 and $121.75.\n\nSteady Rise in Active Addresses\n\nSource- TheBlock\n\nDespite a correction phase in the price behavior, the active addresses in the Solana network show Parabolic growth. According to on-chain data from \u2018The Block,\u2019 the number of active addresses has reached a six-month high of 444.48k. This higher number of active addresses indicates growing interest and participation in the Solana ecosystem and the demand for SOL tokens in the long term.\n\nVortex indicator: A bearish crossover between the VI+ And VI- slopes accentuate a correction mode is active.\n\nExponential Moving Average: The 20-day EMA slope offers strong pullback support to buyers."

According to the analyst, FLIP may see more rallies as it gets listed on more crypto exchanges.\n\n\u201cGrabbed some FLIP.\n\nNew pair, similar idea to [THORChain] RUNE. No legit perp markets yet, only a few spot listings\u2026 I can see this running hard as we see it listed at more venues.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, FLIP is worth $6.04.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin (BTC), The Flow Horse said that the crypto king\u2019s rally to a new 2023 high of $38,189 on Friday looked unsustainable. According to the analyst, traders were fueling the surge by selling their altcoins to participate in BTC\u2019s move up.\n\n\u201cBitcoin pushing up [on Friday] at the expense of altcoins. More or less expect this type of behavior at key inflection points, as no one wants to be out of BTC when it looks like it might rip.

        "content": "Analysts take a look at the impact of Robinhood\u2019s relisting of Solana on the price.\n\nAnalyst has predicted that Solana could go as high as $300 in early next year.\n\nIn June this year, crypto exchange Robinhood announced its decision to delist three major assets \u2013 Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL). According to the exchange, the reason had to do with its latest review of the assets with no elaboration made. Over the period, Solana was in a bearish run as the asset was still struggling from the FTX failure.\n\nIn a surprise turn of events, SOL has made a 180 percent surge in the last three months to trade at $57.96, adding $37.30 to its previous price. In the last 30 days, SOL has surged by 81 percent but has declined by 0.31 percent in the last 24 hours. With this incredible performance, a relist of the asset on Robinhood could be a catalyst for a bullish continuation. Analysts listed two main reasons that could trigger a bull run when Robinhood relists SOL.\n\nThe first is the removal of regulatory uncertainties. The reason for the delisting of Solana was attributed by some crypto experts to the regulatory concerns from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It can be recalled that the SEC listed Solana as one of the 12 assets believed to be securities in the lawsuit against Binance. The decision, is, therefore, associated with an abundance of caution according to some crypto experts. Relisting would therefore reduce the fears surrounding the possible crackdown on the asset and could trigger another bull run.\n\nMore on the Solana Price Analysis\n\nAnother reason why this could be a piece of good news for existing investors is the potential returns of retail investors. Currently, Robinhood provides a real-time market update on Solana but remains untradable. When things change, retail investors can easily trade in the asset. The exchange has more than 10 million monthly active users, and the relisting decision could attract millions of dollars into the ecosystem.\n\nOne interesting observation of Robinhood\u2019s users is that most of them are young. According to research, young investors are mostly attracted by tech stocks and cryptocurrencies. Recently, Ark Invest\u2019s CEO Cathie Wood lauded Solana, calling it faster and more effective.\n\nSolana is doing a really good job. If you look at Ethereum it was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day. Solana is faster and more cost-effective than Ethereum.\n\nFrom the current price, Nathan Jacobs, Senior Researcher at The Money Mongers has predicted that Solana could surge to between $250 and $300 by early 2024.\n\nIf Solana stays on its hot streak and dodges tech troubles, I reckon it could hit between $250 to $300 when 2024 rolls in. Its appeal to the [decentralized finance (DeFi)]and [non-fungible token (NFT)] scenes is a huge plus, given its tech chops with fast and cheap transactions.\n\nDerek Rodriguez, founder and CEO of Gridlock, has also predicted that Solana would continue its upward surge to hit a resistance level at $100 around January and February. Also, he predicted that Solana could plummet to around $60, and then take another surge to hit $200 in late 2024.\n\nRecommended for you:"
