        "content": "In the cryptocurrency industry, investors are always monitoring different digital assets to see those with potential bullish movements. Currently, there is growing interest in Solana and Tradecruve\u2019s token, with speculations of a potential price surge. The question now is if it will happen.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSolana Price Prediction: Is SOL Gearing Up For Price Pump?\n\nSolana experienced a significant decline following the FTX collapse in November 2022. However, the token has shown signs of recovery in recent months. From a low of $8.39 on December 29th, the coin climbed to a peak of $26.93 on February 20th, 2023. Unfortunately, in March, the collapse of the Silvergate bank had a negative impact on the crypto market, causing Solana to drop to a low of $16.12 on March 10th. Currently, Solana is battling bullish and bearish forces around the crucial $15.28 support level.\n\nAlthough bulls struggled to maintain the price above $15.28, the bears have been able to pull the price down with the token trading at $14.83 by press time. If bearish pressure persists, there is a possibility of retesting the intraday low of $12.80 recorded on June 10th. However, there are indications of a potential price rally as the RSI levels suggest oversold conditions. To initiate an upward movement, the bulls need to regain the $15.28 price level and overcome resistance at $16.20, which could lead to a possible upswing toward the 20-day EMA at $18.16.\n\nAccording to DigitalCoinPrice, Solana could trade around $52.76 in 2023 and potentially reach $246.50 by 2030. CoinPriceForecast also provides positive projections, suggesting that the coin could trade at $41.95 by the end of 2023 and $54.64 by 2025.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) Set for Price Increase\n\nWhile Solana has lost a crucial price support level, Tradecurve (TCRV) has been bullish over the last two months, and on-chain data suggests that the token is getting set for another price increase.\n\nWith the prospect of increased adoption among traders and increased trading volumes, there is a possibility that the TCRV price could surge to $0.1 in the coming months.\n\nThe trading platform of Tradecurve is the main reason behind the strong performance of TCRV and the bullish predictions of analysts. Unlike CEXs like OKX and Gemini, Tradecurve has a wide range of trading assets and exposure to various markets such as commodities, cryptocurrencies, forex, CFDs, and stocks. Additionally, Tradecurve will boast one of the lowest transaction fee structures in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTradecurve plans to launch a metaverse trading academy to help both beginners and experts enhance their trading skills. The platform also offers other benefits such as AI trading, copy trading, and bot trading.\n\nCurrently, during its fourth token presale stage, the TCRV token is available for purchase at a mere $0.018. Tradecurve has achieved impressive success by selling millions of its tokens during its presale. Analysts have predicted a potential 50% price surge for the token by the end of June.\n\nLearn more about the Tradecurve presale below:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram"

        "title": "DeFi is possible on Bitcoin, but does anybody want it? - Blockworks",
        "content": "DeFi has long been at home on smart contract-capable virtual machine protocols like Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin has generally been perceived as a tool for storing value, at least until the recent Ordinals craze got people thinking about what it could become.\n\nThe DeFi realm that once existed outside of the Bitcoin domain has been made available through solutions that operate on top of the protocol, with the advantages of security and liquidity built into the Bitcoin network.\n\nRetro-fitting modern scaling mechanisms to the slow-moving \u201cdigital gold\u201d blockchain has proven technically challenging. But do people really want DeFi on Bitcoin?\n\nDeFi apps with slick interfaces and robust smart contract options are commonplace elsewhere. But, according to Muneeb Ali, the most popular will inevitably find themselves on Bitcoin.\n\nThe co-creator of Stacks and CEO of Trust Machines spoke to Blockworks on the 0xResearch podcast (Spotify / Apple) about the \u201cBitcoin thesis\u201d \u2014 the long-standing argument among loyalists that says any useful application on another chain will eventually come to Bitcoin.\n\nAnd any app or asset that makes its way to the network will also be more valuable, he says, \u201cbecause they will benefit from the security of Bitcoin, the durability of Bitcoin, but above all the liquidity of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m very confident in the \u2018yet\u2019\n\nAli says market data previously demonstrated a lack of interest in building for such use-cases on Bitcoin, but that\u2019s changing. \u201cThis year, with Ordinals and more recently with BRC-20, part of the thesis is actually coming true.\u201d\n\nThis is \u201cliterally the case\u201d with NFTs, he says. Once inscribed on Bitcoin, the market assessed some previously Ethereum-based tokens with hefty prices earlier this year.\n\nTrailing Ethereum alone, \u201cBitcoin is now number two in terms of trading volumes of NFTs. And Solana is number three,\u201d he says. \u201cSix months ago, this would be unimaginable. Bitcoin was not even on the map.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t played out in DeFi \u2014 yet. \u201cI\u2019m very confident in the \u2018yet\u2019,\u201d Ali says.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the more pristine capital,\u201d Ali says. More people have bought into the idea of bitcoin as money or as a potential reserve currency, he says.\n\nBut not for much else.\n\nThat\u2019s not the fault of Bitcoin, according to Ali. It\u2019s mostly due to lack of infrastructure \u2014 tooling, wallets, and the developer community around Bitcoin \u2014 as opposed to a lack of interest, he says.\n\nPeople will use Bitcoin\n\nAli argues there\u2019s plenty of demand for smart contract solutions on Bitcoin. He gives the example of RSK, or Rootstock, a smart contract competitor to Stacks that\u2019s been building on the network for years. \u201cThey did their fundraising in Bitcoin and I think 25,000 BTC came into that raise.\u201d\n\nStacks differs from RSK in a few key ways, with its \u201cnovel consensus mechanism, ambitious plans for subnets,\u201d and in particular, its \u201cunique BTC bridge\u201d that does not rely on \u201ca trusted set of signers,\u201d according to Blockworks Research.\n\nAli mentions examples of applications like privacy tumblers that have seen large volumes of bitcoin being used, despite them being \u201creally clunky.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best you can do on [layer-1],\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s nothing close to a zero-knowledge-based solution that has great UX\u201d \u2014 something that is more likely to be found on Ethereum or Solana. For now, anyway.\n\n\u201cIf you start bringing those use cases,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s as obvious as putting two and two together that people will use Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenge really is in the infrastructure tooling, devs, and UX wallets,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that needs to be much more mature than the state we are in today.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
