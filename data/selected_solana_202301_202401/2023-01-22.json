        "content": "A widely followed trader says he sees more upside potential for smart contract platform Solana (SOL) and two tokens flying under the radar.\n\nPseudonymous Cantering Clark tells his 158,900 Twitter followers that traders who continue to bet against the Ethereum rival will likely be blown out of their positions by a short squeeze.\n\n\u201cThis weekend is probably going to be nuts for alts.\n\nSOL is going +$30 before this is all over.\n\nMajor squeeze through this level seems obvious.\u201d\n\nA short squeeze happens when traders who borrow an asset at a certain price in hopes of selling it for lower to pocket the difference are forced to buy back the assets they borrowed as momentum moves against them, triggering further rallies.\n\nAt time of writing, Solana is switching hands for $25.\n\nNext up is move-to-earn token STEPN (GMT), which he predicts will likely rally toward his target at $6.63.\n\n\u201cThey are still active on socials and I expect that they start making announcements and trying to raise prices again to take advantage of this rally. Reclaim and retest setup that has been seen broadly across all alts is on the table as well. Send.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, GMT is trading at $0.49.\n\nThe last coin on the trader\u2019s radar is Optimism (OP), a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH). According to Cantering Clark, he expects OP to print fresh all-time highs.\n\n\u201cOP is about to enter price discovery. This means anyone who sold before was wrong, and new highs usually bring inflows from all types of traders.\n\nNew all-time high after a prolonged period of time is +expected value buy.\n\nSend.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, OP is swapping hands for $2.24, slightly above the trader\u2019s resistance area of $2.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Three Cryptocurrencies To Moon: Solana, Uniswap, And Big Eyes Coin - Tekedia",
        "content": "Since its inception in 2009, crypto has changed the financial world and lined the pockets of many early investors. Today, if you mention the term Bitcoin (BTC), most people will know what you\u2019re referring to as digital currency.\n\nHowever, many people feel like they missed their opportunity with Bitcoin, as it went from the value of less than a dollar, to reaching a peak of over 48,000 dollars! Although Bitcoin is a great long-term investment option, many people are unaware of an entire world of altcoins to choose from, which could see their value skyrocket.\n\nIn this article, we will be looking at three of our altcoin picks: Solana (SOL), Uniswap (UNI), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG): The New Dog Killer\n\nA trailblazing kitty has started with a bang by making over $16.2 million dollars in pre-sale! Now that\u2019s apaws-able.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a meme community token, which aims to shift wealth into decentralised finance (DeFi), but is also committed to saving the oceans, with over 5% of its tokens placed in a visible charity wallet!\n\nUnlike its competitors in the meme coin market, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which rely on the overly saturated dog mascot, Big Eyes Coin (BIG), uniquely uses an irresistibly cute cat as the face of the project.\n\nBig Eyes is proud of being a community token, as it can be seen on the Twitter page they are consistently launching competitions and are finding ways to get their awesome loyal community members involved.\n\nWith definitive goals, solid community backing and their new NFT launch, Big Eyes Coin seems to be headed to the moon! And with its 200% bonus code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 now live, which gives any investment an extra 200%! Additionally, the Big Eyes Coin website\u2019s new calculator tool makes it so much easier to figure out any potential earnings, allowing you to see how you could go to the moon with Big Eyes Coin.\n\nUniswap (UNI): The Unicorn that could Grant Your Wishes\n\nUniswap (UNI) is one of the largest and considered most secure decentralized exchanges for swapping tokens, allowing users to quickly and simply trade Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens. Uniswap was first launched in November 2018 as a platform created to remove the barriers of entry and make token swaps available to anyone. It uses automated market makers (AMM) which allows users to buy and sell digital assets without the need for a central counterparty.\n\nThe special feature of the Uniswap token (UNI) is that it gives users access to a staggeringly wide variety of digital assets, allowing investors to diversify their holdings across a wide variety of tokens. Furthermore, by offering a totally decentralised platform\u2014all transactions are completed peer-to-peer, directly between traders, with no middleman \u2013 Uniswap eliminates counterparty risk. Additionally, traders that use Uniswap benefit from minimal trading fees because there is no middleman in the transaction.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an alternative way to invest in cryptocurrencies that could help you diversify your portfolio and potentially get higher returns \u2013 then investing in Uniswap may be right for you!\n\nSolana (SOL): The Ethereum Killer\n\nSolana (SOL) is an open-source network which has been titled the \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d through its ability to conduct transactions at a rapid speed!\n\nIt is impressively capable of facilitating over 50,000 transactions per second, which is 1000 times faster than Bitcoin and more than 3,000 times faster than Ethereum! The fact Solana is able to work more quickly than Bitcoin and Ethereum makes it more scalable and suitable for investors who are looking to double their digits.\n\nAccording to the data on CoinMarketCap, in the last thirty days, Solana has surged by a whopping 72.92% at the time of writing! This is an incredible score considering that it\u2019s a bear market. With this in mind, you may want to consider scooping up some Solana!\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nWith cryptocurrency and Bitcoin steadily on the rise again, it\u2019s a great time to consider buying some coins! Of course, you could stock up on Bitcoin, which should be here for the long run \u2013 but, if you want to see more significant gains, then look towards altcoins as many of which have yet to take off to the moon!\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPre-sale: https://buy.bigeyes.space\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"
