        "content": "In a major move for its global operations, Solana is reportedly planning a massive $10 million expansion into Brazil. The Solana Foundation has targeted the South American country as a key growth area. Moreover, that is proven by the massive investment that the firm is planning in the country.\n\nDiego Dias, Solana\u2019s Head of the Brazilian and Latam Grops, noted the firm\u2019s intention to empower the growth of a Web3 ecosystem in the country. Subsequently, the non-profit is set to infuse Brazil\u2019s Web3 initiatives with the investment to build areas like tokenized assets, AI, and more.\n\nSource: PYMNTS.com\n\nAlso Read: Solana Holds Steady Above $100; Will SOL Hit $130 Soon?\n\nSolana Planning Web3 Investment Into Brazil\n\nThe past year has certainly been one defined by its growth in the digital asset sector. A host of networks and tokens have seen regulatory action taken across the globe. Moreover, these entities have explored various expansive efforts to increase the presence of Web3 technology worldwide.\n\nThat is continuing today, as Solana has announced it is planning a $10 million expansion into Brazil. Specifically, the non-profit organization is set to inject Brazilian Web3 projects with the funds. Subsequently, it should bring about a new development in the country\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nAlso Read: Solana: How High Can SOL Rise In January 2024?\n\n\u201cOur intention at the Solana Foundation is to have a diminishing influence on the ecosystem and empower our community to lead the future of Solana,\u201d Dias stated. Moreover, they noted that the investment will see Solana sponsor a \u201csuperteam\u201d in Brazil. Moreover, the development team will be similar to what the foundation has already formulated in seven other countries.\n\nDias stated that the superteams began as decentralized organizations, but now operate as worldwide extensions of the Solana Foundation. For Brazil, this investment is set to equip local developers in ways that should bear increased fruit for its Web3 development. Subsequently, it should continue the great work Solana is doing on an international level."

        "content": "Decentralized exchanges (DEX) transaction volume on Arbitrum, a layer2 network, surpassed that of Ethereum for the first time during the past day, according to DeFillama data.\n\nDuring the reporting period, DEXs on Arbitrum saw their volume soar to $1.843 billion, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s $1.444 billion and Solana\u2019s $683.59 million.\n\nThis surge aligns with Arbitrum\u2019s continuous weekly growth, rising by 32.58% to $6.804 billion, a new all-time high, though still trailing Ethereum\u2019s $9.581 billion. However, it surpasses Solana\u2019s $5.039 billion and notably exceeds Binance Smart Chain\u2019s daily volume by nearly fourfold.\n\nThe rising DEX volume also coincided with high-network activity on the layer2 network. During the past day, Arbitrum\u2019s daily transaction per second stood at 14.05, while Ethereum mainnet\u2019s was 12.92, according to L2beat data.\n\nUniswap dominates\n\nThe increased trading volume can be attributed to heightened activity on Arbitrum\u2019s DEXs like Uniswap, Camelot, Ramses Exchange, and Trader Joe. Data from DeFillama shows that these protocols have enjoyed double-digit growth to new highs during the past week.\n\nUniswap Labs, the developers of the popular decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, revealed that Arbitrum became the first layer2 network to cross a billion in daily volume on the platform on Jan. 4.\n\nUniswap is the largest DEX protocol by trading volume across all chains, with an average volume of more than $1.5 billion during the past week.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s rising TVL\n\nThe rising DEX volume has also coincided with a sharp increase in the total value of assets locked on the Ethereum-based layer2 network.\n\nData from DefiLlama shows the TVL on Arbitrum-based applications has increased by around $1 billion in the last six months to nearly $2.5 billion, with the dominant DeFi protocol being GMX, a decentralized spot, and perpetual exchange, which controls about 20% of the network\u2019s total TVL.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum\u2019s native ARB token recently reached a new all-time high of more than $2 on Jan. 4 but has retraced to $1.94 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "The layer-1 blockchain network Solana may soon start to see layer-2 networks building in its ecosystem. In a Friday tweet, Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko stated that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing stopping developers\u201d from creating layer-2 blockchains on the Solana network.\n\nWhat are Layer-2 Networks?\n\nLayer-2 solutions are blockchain networks built on an existing layer-1 blockchain. These secondary protocols benefit from the base blockchain\u2019s network and security. At the same time, it solves the base network\u2019s scalability issues, facilitating faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThese L2 networks enable transactions off-chain. These off-chain trades are bundled and transported to the base blockchain, reducing the burden on them. An example of a blockchain network with several L2 networks is the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nNotably, L2s are not to be confused with sidechains, an independent chain linked to a parent blockchain to address the scalability issue. Unlike layer-2 networks that rely on the layer-1 blockchain\u2019s security, sidechains have separate security characteristics from the base blockchain. A popular sidechain is the Ronin network.\n\nL2s to Build on Solana\n\nIn his tweet, Yakovenko categorized layer-2 networks, side chains, and zero-knowledge (zk) proofs as bringing the same result. He explains that these technologies cannot be as good as a well-optimized layer-1 blockchain.\n\nOperating a well-optimized L1 network entails that all transactions and projects will live on the base blockchain, promoting a \u201cglobal atomic state machine\u201d where all decentralized apps (dApps) and users will have access to the same data in real-time without passing through an L2 solution or side chain.\n\nWhile acknowledging that L2s and sidechains \u201care innovative and welcomed,\u201d Yakovenko emphasized that Solana\u2019s goal is to bring the entirety of its on-chain services into a single execution layer that would undergo \u201chardware upgrades in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile. it is likely that a shift towards layer-2 networks will allow for more projects to onboard the Solana ecosystem. This may have a ripple effect on the blockchain\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL. At the time of writing, SOL traded at $102."

        "content": "The surge in Arbitrum\u2019s daily volume likely stems from the upcoming Ethereum upgrade dubbed Dencun, not the memecoin frenzy experienced by other blockchain networks.\n\nArbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has taken the lead in daily volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX) for the first time in Arbitrum\u2019s history, according to the most recent data from crypto analytics firm DefiLlama.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the total value of transactions made on Arbitrum by crypto users stands at $1.83 billion, taking the lead from base layer blockchain Ethereum, which has a 24-hour volume of $1.44 billion. In fact, the combined 24-hour volume of Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism and zkSync Era is less than that of Arbitrum.\n\n\n\nThe historical leader in 24-hour volume has been Ethereum, though its seat on the throne has been challenged recently. Solana, a layer 1 blockchain that implements proof-of-history, surpassed Ethereum\u2019s daily DEX volume for several days in December 2023. Now, less than a month later, Arbitrum has taken the lead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy feat, there\u2019s a lot of chains and not many have been able to do that, even if it\u2019s just temporarily,\u201d said Martin Lee, content lead at on-chain metrics firm Nansen, to Unchained via Telegram. \u201cWhile it\u2019s an impressive achievement, ideally, I\u2019d want to see this trend continue over a longer time horizon before putting any weight behind it. We\u2019ve seen moments where chains get massive spikes in activity but few manage to maintain it.\u201d\n\nDencun\u2019s Impact\n\nThe spike in Arbitrum\u2019s volume likely stems from the upcoming Ethereum upgrade known as Dencun, Lee noted. Set to be activated on several testnets this month, Dencun is the first major upgrade to Ethereum since Shapella in April of last year, which enabled stakers to withdraw their ETH. The newest upgrade includes EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, which is designed to scale Ethereum in a decentralized way.\n\n\u201cProto-danksharding reduces the cost of posting large amounts of data to Ethereum and thereby lowers the operational cost of rollups,\u201d wrote Galaxy\u2019s vice president of research Christine Kim in a research report last June. \u201cEIP 4844 is considered a boost to Ethereum scalability because it makes Layer-2 networks built atop Ethereum more cost-effective,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn addition, Carlos Mercado, data scientist at blockchain data firm Flipside Crypto told Unchained over Telegram that \u201cArbitrum over the last few weeks has been preparing for Arbitrum Orbit, their competitor to the Optimism \u2018Superchain\u2019 thesis,\u201d a network of chains that all share Optimism\u2019s open-source development stack.\n\nNotably, the surge in Arbitrum\u2019s daily DEX volume is not from the recent memecoin frenzy that has gone viral on other Layer-1 networks such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Avalanche. Memecoins \u201cnever took off\u201d on Arbitrum, according to Nansen\u2019s Lee.\n\nARB, the native governance token for the Arbitrum ecosystem, has slid roughly 11% in the past 24 hours, but has gained nearly 27% in the past seven days to change hands at $1.86, according to CoinGecko.\n\nDisclosure: Arbitrum is a sponsor of Unchained."
