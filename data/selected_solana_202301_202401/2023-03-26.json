        "content": "Solana (SOL) is well-known as the best alternative to Ethereum (ETH). The coin shares some similarities to the market's second most popular crypto asset. However, Solana (SOL) offers a much different alternative, making it a better alternative than any other option in the market. Solana (SOL) boasts of the ability to facilitate over 50,000 transactions per second. This transaction speed is 1,000 times faster than Bitcoin (BTC) and 3,000 times faster than Ethereum (ETH). The coin also boasts of being a more scalable option than Ethereum (ETH), making it perfect for investors interested in making a profit. Solana (SOL) is also taking a step towards a better tomorrow by taking a different approach. It makes use of the proof of stake consensus to validate new transactions. The proof of stake method encourages stakeholders to stake their coins to include new blocks to the blockchain. In addition to the proof of stake method, Solana (SOL) also makes use of the proof of history consensus to provide additional security."

        "content": "Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra has a large contingent of students from North County.\n\nMainly Mozart Youth Orchestra is gearing up for the registration period for its 2023-24 season.\n\n\u201cWe are now in North County,\u201d said Joseph Shanks, the youth orchestra manager. \u201cFor years we were at Mesa College, and during Covid with the loss of venue and all that, we transitioned up to North County, which is unique because unless you\u2019re up in Escondido, we\u2019re the only youth orchestra in the region.\u201d\n\nThe youth orchestra serves about 300 students, including almost half who are from Solana Beach, Del Mar and Carmel Valley. There are seven ensembles to accommodate student musicians of all skill levels. Students who want to join have to go through an audition process in the spring or fall.\n\nAbout 30 years ago, Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra began as the San Diego Young Artists Symphony, according to the orchestra\u2019s website. About 10 years ago, San Diego Young Artists Symphony merged with Mainly Mozart and was renamed the Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is education,\u201d said Shanks, who completed a B.A. in music at California Polytechnic University and a master of music degree in viola performance from San Diego State University. \u201cThat\u2019s our primary purpose, is providing the highest quality orchestral music education opportunities.\u201d\n\nStudents from each ensemble attend weekly rehearsals every Saturday in Solana Beach.\n\n\u201cIt ranges from brand new players, who never touched an instrument before, all the way up to our advanced orchestra, which is mostly high schoolers,\u201d Shanks said. \u201cThat group plays real symphonic music. They just played Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s ninth symphony in our last concert. They\u2019re very good, and a lot of our students go off to music schools or just continue music throughout their lives.\u201d\n\nThe music director is Hernan Constantino, a member of the San Diego Symphony for the last 30 years. Other instructors also bring an extensive amount of musical experience in education and performance.\n\nEach season runs from approximately the same timeframe as the school year, with each ensemble performing twice.\n\nUpcoming events include the rising stars and seniors showcase on April 29 at Kristin Greene Recital Hall in Miramar and the Bach Brandenburg Concertos on May 16 at St. Elizabeth Seton Catholic Church in Carlsbad.\n\n\u201cWe would love to eventually be able to tour, take the advanced group to Disney or New York,\u201d Shanks said. \u201cThose are long-term goals for sure.\u201d\n\nMainly Mozart Youth Orchestra holds regular Saturday rehearsals at Calvary Lutheran Church, located at 424 Via De La Valle in Solana Beach. For more information about upcoming registration and other orchestra events, visit mmyo.org. Also, see more information below regarding spring auditions:\n\nAuditions for Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra\n\nSpring auditions are coming up for student musicians applying for the Mainly Mozart Youth Orchestra.\n\nAuditions for the 2023-24 season take place April 13-15, when students submit videos of required audition material. Each student records three videos: performing scales, doing a solo piece, and performing excerpts from orchestral pieces chosen by the MMYO instructors.\n\nAuditions are for placement into Beginning Strings (ages 6-10), Intermediate Strings (ages 10-12), Intermediate Orchestra/Concert Band (ages 11-16), and Advanced Orchestra (ages 13- 18).\n\nThe sign-up window for Suzuki Stars (K-3) also opens April 13. No audition is required. Suzuki Stars provides group class instruction for beginner violin, viola and cello students. Students learn the basics of holding and playing their instruments.\n\nVisit mmyo.org; the link goes live April 13 for students to submit videos.\n\n\u2014 Laura Groch, from The San Diego Union-Tribune, contributed to this report"
