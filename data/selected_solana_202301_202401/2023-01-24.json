We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former lead of Ark Invest's crypto department, Chris Burniske, believes Solana and Ethereum can be used as more than trading and investment instruments but also as risk indicators. Here's how.\n\nCrypto risk spectrum\n\nAccording to the analyst, the SOL/ETH trading pair can be used as a key indicator of the crypto risk spectrum or, simply put, a tool to evaluate the risk tolerance of cryptocurrency investors on the market. Considering that both Solana and Ethereum are historically far more volatile than Bitcoin, using them to determine if the current risk level on the market is beneficial.\n\n$SOLETH has become a key indicator of crypto risk-spectrum appetite for me, alongside the OG of $ETHBTC. \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) January 24, 2023\n\nHowever, Solana and Ethereum are not only assets that can be used as risk indicators. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is a reflection of risk tolerance among investors. Digital assets are extremely volatile and sometimes illiquid, which makes crypto investors extremely vulnerable to double-digit swings, especially if margin trading is in effect. Those who expose themselves to such instruments are considered risk tolerant from the standpoint of a traditional investor.\n\n\"Doesn't look like it wants to stop\"\n\nAccording to Burniske, it seems like ETH to SOL does not look like it will be retracing any time soon, suggesting that appetite for risk is going to move upward only, instead of going down. However, considering cryptocurrency' s market dependency from stocks and traditional markets in general, Solana or Ethereum should not be considered as market-moving assets or indicators.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the cryptocurrency market had an enormous and explosive rally that led to numerous breakthroughs and helped assets to reach important resistance levels that, if broken, will most likely lead to long-term reversals and the beginning of a prolonged new bull market."

One of those is Tiny Colony, which has just announced its move to, and launch on, the ImmutableX (IMX) chain.\n\nInitially developed on the Solana blockchain, Tiny Colony is one of Web3/crypto\u2019s first management and construction sim titles (Illuvium: Zero, also on ImmutableX, is another early mover in this category).\n\nThis one is notable for a few reasons \u2013 for one, the people developing it, who consist of filmmaking, scriptwriting and animation veterans from giant mainstream gaming and entertainment companies including EA, Capcom, Netflix and PlayStation.

These NFT assets will be able to be used in-game or traded.\n\nSo, similar to the Illuvium ecosystem of interoperable blockchain games, there is a chance to create real-world value from your time spent playing the game.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the Tiny Colony world is set up for players to grind in a play-to-earn capacity, however, which is a concept that\u2019s beginning to die out in blockchain gaming according to the likes of Illuvium founder Kieran Warwick and Web3 gaming influencers such as Brycent. This game definitely looks to be falling in the fun-first, earn-as-bonus camp.\n\nCo-founder Navabi has been working on this thing since 2018, bringing in others along the way, and one result of all his passion-project time and energy is that the gaming elements intertwine and connect through a well-developed story and rich lore.\n\nHave a delve into the Tiny Colony website if you wish to learn more. Existing Tiny Colony NFT holders can access an MVP version of the game to test the core mechanics and provide feedback to the development team.\n\nNote: This article is not sponsored by Tiny Colony or ImmutableX. The author is, however, interested in covering projects that will potentially progress the future of the blockchain gaming industry.\n\nHe currently owns a small amount of IMX, as well as some Illuvium (ILV) but has not made any investment into TINY.\n\nNone of this information represents financial advice.\n\nRead More CryptocurrencyGamingNFT"
