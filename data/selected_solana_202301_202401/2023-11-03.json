        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) is sustaining its upward momentum as it overtakes layer-2 scaling solution Polygon (MATIC) in daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volume.\n\nNew data from blockchain tracking platform Artemis reveals that the smart contract platform has surpassed MATIC in both overall DEX volume and the number of daily transactions.\n\nArtemis\u2019 data shows that as of yesterday, Solana had a DEX volume of about $240.5 million, outpacing Polygon\u2019s $137.5 million.\n\nThe numbers also show that Solana greatly surpassed Polygon \u2013 and other digital assets such as ETH and Avalanche (AVAX) \u2013 in terms of daily transactions. Solana has seen millions more daily transactions compared to its competitors, logging 19.5 million on November 2nd compared to ETH\u2019s 1.05 million, MATIC\u2019s 2.59 million, and AVAX\u2019s 192,000.\n\nAnother chart that displays Solana\u2019s recent upward momentum is that of market cap. Since the start of October, SOL has been outpacing its competitors in terms of market cap, setting itself apart even further in November.\n\nSolana\u2019s growth has also been reflected in its price, as the smart contract platform has seen about a 300% increase in price since January 1, 2023, when it was trading for just $9.97. Solana is moving for $39.36 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nRecently, two prominent crypto strategists commented on the rise of Solana First, macro guru Raoul Paul said that Solana resembled a \u201crocket ship\u201d after the release of Firedance, a new validator client for the SOL blockchain that improved its scalability and speed.\n\nDays later, pseudonymous crypto trader Pentoshi predicted that the ETH rival would retrace toward the $32 range \u2013 only to set up another move to the upside.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The search is on for Solana Beach School District\u2019s next superintendent.\n\nAfter Superintendent Jodee Brentinger announced that she will retire in January, the school board tapped Educational Support Services (ESS) to lead its search, the same firm that also recently conducted San Dieguito Union High School District\u2019s search. ESS consultants Suzette Lovely and Joe Farley also facilitated the search that resulted in the placement of Brentlinger in 2018, although at that time they were with the firm of Hazard, Young, Attea & Associates: \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the work we\u2019ve done here,\u201d Lovely said.\n\nThe board held a workshop on Nov. 2 to discuss a timeline for the search and the process for community involvement. ESS will host focus groups with key education partners and two community forum meetings in Carmel Valley and Solana Beach, each with Mandarin and Spanish interpreters available. There will also be an online survey.\n\nSBSD board President Debra Schade said while they don\u2019t expect high numbers of attendance, with this type of hire it\u2019s important to have a venue for public feedback in both areas of the district. Lovely noted that in San Dieguito they held two sessions in the northern and southern parts of the district\u2014the first held at San Dieguito Academy had about 40 people attend, and the second at Pacific Trails Middle School had about 25-30 people in attendance although about half had also come to the other session.\n\nThe Solana Beach district forums have yet to be scheduled but updated information will be posted on the district website under superintendent search.\n\nThe board is anticipated to select a slate of candidates on Dec. 13 with interviews scheduled for Jan. 13-14, 2024. They are aiming to approve the contract for the new superintendent on Feb 8.\n\nThrough the survey and community outreach meetings, ESS will develop a leadership profile for the next superintendent. Everyone will be asked for the same input: what the strengths of the district are, what challenges and issues a new superintendent might face and the desired characteristics of an ideal superintendent.\n\nFarley said the input received, complied with survey results, helps shape the leadership profile which serves as a screening instrument for candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of a fascinating process \u2026the truth really emerges,\u201d Farley said. \u201cYou get very solid data about where your district is and what the leadership needs are.\u201d\n\nThe board is expected to approve the leadership profile on Dec. 5, after its new trustee has been sworn in. The board will be interviewing candidates for the board seat in open session on Nov. 9 to fill the seat of Vicki King, who announced her resignation last month.\n\n"

        "title": "Cardano (ADA) Announces New Partnership, Everlodge (ELDG) and Solana (SOL) Bull Run Continues - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have long been considered some of the most promising blockchain projects.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a new player in town that\u2019s been gaining significant attention lately, and it goes by the name of Everlodge (ELDG).\n\nCardano (ADA): A Partnership with Educational Impact\n\nRecently, Emurgo, a founding entity of Cardano (ADA), unveiled a strategic partnership with the Institute of Blockchain Singapore (IBS), emphasizing the growing significance of blockchain education worldwide. Cardano is serious about improving blockchain compre\u00adhension. They\u2019re devoted to it.\n\nDespite this fact, some critics say that Cardano nee\u00adds to turn these educational ve\u00adntures into real value. Marke\u00adt experts reckon Cardano\u2019s worth may rise.\n\nStill, Cardano will need to show how its teaching efforts can become practical use and broade\u00adr acceptance to confirm its place as a top blockchain figure.\n\nSolana (SOL): Displays Bullish Signals\n\nSolana (SOL) stands out in the blockchain space and is known for its high-speed, scalable, and secure ecosystem. Recently, the crypto market witnessed a surge in investments. The digital asset investment firm CoinShares reported net inflows of $326M into crypto-focused investment funds.\n\nThis substantial influx marks the most significant single-week increase since July 2022. Solana has received these investments, with Solana investment vehicles reporting net inflows of $24M. The faith in the Solana coin and ecosystem remains strong, as evidenced by the continued investor interest.\n\nExperts are saying that the price of Solana might continue to rise. SOL has done pretty well, but investors want more than that.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Could It Leave Cardano and Solana Behind?\n\nWhile Cardano and Solana have distinct strengths and use cases, Everlodge (ELDG) will bring a novel concept \u2013 fractional real estate ownership on the blockchain.\n\nTraditionally, high entry barriers have excluded many investors from this lucrative market. With Everlodge, anyone can own a piece of premium real estate, from luxurious vacation homes to hotels, using blockchain tech. It accomplishes this by digitizing and minting these properties into NFTs and fractionalizing them. Thus, anyone can buy them for prices as low as $100.\n\nAlso, members of the Everlodge Rewards Club can earn free nightly stays across various properties and even generate a passive income by reselling these nights. But, only ELDG native token holders will gain access to this Club.\n\nCurrently, in its sixth presale stage with a price of $0.023, Everlodge is already attracting attention. Unlike Cardano and Solana, its lower market cap could also mean faster value appreciation.\n\nFor more information about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, you can visit their website or join their community here.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.
