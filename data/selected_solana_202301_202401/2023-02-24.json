But it did little to solve the still unknown problem that was weighing down performance. The effort then turned to a more drastic solution: restarting the chain to the point immediately prior to the forking."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nDoing business on the Solana blockchain is more expensive than ever. For the network and its users, that might be a good thing.\n\nPriority fees, a key feature among major tech upgrades Solana developers pushed last year to fight crippling congestion issues, are going mainstream among the ecosystem\u2019s wallets and trading protocols, with heavyweights including exchange aggregator Jupiter and trading pool operator Orca joining in.\n\nUsers can pay the additional fees to validators on the Solana network to have their transactions prioritized \u2013 so they go through faster. The extra boost can make all the difference in high-traffic situations, like a fleeting crypto-trading arbitrage opportunity or in the scramble for a hot non-fungible token (NFT) mint.\n\nIn one recent epoch (the blockchain\u2019s time period for validators) nearly three-quarters of all nonvote transactions had priority fees attached, per data from validator statistics service Solana Compass. That rate set a new high water mark for priority fee adoption, which has been growing all year.\n\nThe average transaction fee Solana users paid in that epoch (epoch 402) was 0.000014641 SOL, a 67% increase over rates in early July but still only fractions of a penny based on the current market price. That added up to 963 SOL spent on priority fees last epoch, or nearly $24,000 \u2013 a rounding error based on the overall value moving across the network.\n\n\u201cMost users can pay 100x current costs and not care since it's still sub-cent,\u201d the pseudonymous 7Layer, who runs Overclock validator service, said in a Twitter DM.\n\nThe priority fees are helping bring order to a network that\u2019s had its share of chaos, most memorably and infamously at the hands of trading bots who in 2021 spammed the network into oblivion. Developers say such things shouldn\u2019t happen under the new tech regime.\n\nTrade-Offs\n\nSolana\u2019s trade-off between price and speed isn\u2019t nearly as poignant as on Ethereum, where congestion in one corner of the network makes doing business expensive for everyone. That\u2019s because Solana\u2019s architecture is built to handle many transactions at once, said Austin Federa, head of strategy for the Solana Foundation.\n\nFor example: If lots of traders are trying to swap BONK tokens for the stablecoin USDC on the same exchange at once, they might start paying priority fees to ensure their trades go through at the prices they want. But even during that high traffic time, the local fee market for minting an NFT elsewhere on Solana won\u2019t get more expensive. On Ethereum it would.\n\nStory continues\n\nJonny Platt, CEO of Solana Compass, told CoinDesk priority fees are changing the economics of running his validators on Solana. He said average block rewards are 20% higher year over year.\n\nHalf of the value of priority fees go to validators such as Platt as reward for lending their compute power to the network; the other half of the priority fee gets burned. Platt said this burn mechanism should drive more value into SOL tokens over time by making the tokens more scarce.\n\n\u201cSo many normal everyday users of Solana are excited to see this because there\u2019s recognition that we\u2019ve improved over last year,\u201d Platt said of priority fees.\n\nOutrageous outages\n\nSolana suffered multiple well-documented (and excoriated) network outages in 2022 and 2021, some of which were driven by bots pummeling one corner of the blockchain simultaneously. In one such outage, in September 2021, bots crowded a token sale on exchange Raydium with more transactions than Solana could handle. Solana basically broke, going offline for 17 hours \u2013 an eon in 24/7 cryptocurrency markets.\n\nTo address the spam issue, core developers began a year-long effort to change how Solana handles transactions. It would ditch the \u201cfirst-come-first-served\u201d transaction execution model for \u201cfee markets\u201d that gave favor to those who paid for priority.\n\nSolana transaction fees are the sum of a static base fee plus a dynamic computational fee. With priority fees, users who want faster execution can opt to pay some extra SOL. Bots who previously spammed the network for dominance won\u2019t win on transaction volume alone, validators said.\n\n\u201cIt reduces the incentive because priority based on fee matters more instead of just spamming hard to get in front of the queue,\u201d 7Layer said. \u201cThere haven't been any spam issues close to what they used to be.\u201d\n\nPriority fees haven\u2019t completely solved Solana\u2019s spam issue, said St. Gnu, another pseudonymous validator. The network is extremely cheap to do business on, extra fees or not. He said Solana\u2019s core developers will need to build out more fee features that make spamming less economical.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that if you want to just \u2018spray and pray\u2019 a bunch of transactions there's not really a big cost to do that,\u201d he said in a Telegram message."
