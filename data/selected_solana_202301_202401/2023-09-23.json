        "title": "Eclipse takes a 'best of all worlds' approach to solve scalability trilemma - Blockworks",
        "content": "If you can\u2019t beat them, join them. Like, all of them.\n\nIn the fierce battle for the scalability trilemma crown, Solana, Ethereum and their accompanying ecosystems are often pitted against each other as mutually exclusive solutions.\n\nApparently, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. On the Bell Curve podcast (Spotify/Apple), Blockworks co-founder Michael Ippolito details the recently revealed architecture of Eclipse. The rollup tech harnesses Solana\u2019s speedy execution, Ethereum\u2019s secure settlement, Risc Zero proofs and Celestia data availability in a \u201cbest of all worlds\u201d team approach to scaling.\n\nIppolito says the Solana Virtual Machine or SVM holds some key advantages over Ethereum \u2014 outside of network effects \u2014 particularly in its ability to perform parallel executions. \u201cThe EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) has a single thread processor, which just limits its scale,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou have very fast execution, really cheap [data availability], and it still settles down to [Ethereum],\u201d he says. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to use ETH as the gas token as well. So, it\u2019s kind of a very interesting blend of a whole bunch of different ecosystems.\u201d\n\nRead more: Risc Zero introduces \u2018Type 0\u2019 zkEVM to make zero-knowledge tech more accessible\n\nIn addition, Neon \u2014 an EVM operating on Solana \u2014 will provide compatibility between Ethereum and Solana, Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz explains. \u201cIf you want to easily deploy EVM smart contracts on Eclipse, you can do it through Neon.\u201d\n\nYanowitz says it\u2019s the first time he has seen a fully modular setup that brings \u201call these different providers together.\u201d\n\nIppolito details some of the limitations of Ethereum\u2019s main chain, noting its relatively low throughput and gas costs, in particular. Because of the base fee and computational resources that every transaction requires, \u201cif there\u2019s like a really hot NFT mint, it can multiply the base fee,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThat base fee gets applied to transactions on Uniswap. So the resources are coupled in a way that doesn\u2019t really make sense.\u201d\n\nOne solution is to put every single application on its own blockchain as a rollup. \u201cThat\u2019s the OP stack version of how to solve this problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThe other way that you could solve it is to actually keep everything on one settlement layer and chain, but do what Solana did by creating local fee markets and parallel processing.\u201d\n\nThe competition continues\n\nIppolito doubts that upcoming danksharding upgrades will reduce costs on Ethereum as significantly as some hope. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to reduce costs that much, especially on the canonical rollups that still use Ethereum for data availability,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou need one of these rollups to try something like the solution that Eclipse is pioneering here.\u201d\n\nIppolito credits Eclipse founder Neel Somani with the \u201cclever\u201d modular design of Eclipse, adding, \u201cit\u2019s going to be down to his [business development] chops to actually go and recruit developers.\u201d\n\nSomani will likely be forced to compete with Solana for developers who are familiar with the Rust programming language, Ippolito suggests. \u201cThese are Rust [developers], I think, that he\u2019s hoping to bring over and build applications.\u201d\n\nIt looks like the competitive rivalry that is so prevalent in blockchain will live on, after all.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
