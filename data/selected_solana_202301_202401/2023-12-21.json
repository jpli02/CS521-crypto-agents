According to DefiLlama, DEX volume on Solana soared to $10.1 billion over the last seven days, while Ethereum recorded $8.8 billion in volume during the same period.\n\nSolana's recent surge in DEX activity can be attributed to its lower gas fees compared to Ethereum, and rise of memecoin trading. The chain\u2019s leading memecoin, BONK, dominated headlines after its meteoric rise to over a billion-dollar market capitalization, following Binance and Coinbase listings. Another Solana memecoin, Dogwifhat (WIF), has also captured attention, skyrocketing from obscurity to reach $322 million in market cap. BONK and WIF are among the top traded tokens on Solana DEXs over the past week, excluding stablecoins.\n\nThe success of these memecoins and heightened activity, coupled with major airdrops from protocols like Jito (JTO), have contributed to SOL's impressive rally, with the token flipping XRP and reaching a new 2023 high of $99, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nHowever, despite recent gains, SOL's market cap currently sits just above $41 billion, while Ethereum remains has a market cap of $268 billion, more than seven times larger than Solana.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "BONK BONK/USD, a relatively new dog-themed cryptocurrency, has surged almost 1,000% in just a matter of weeks as the broader Solana SOL/USD ecosystem gains momentum.\n\nWhat Happened: Analysts, however, are warning that late investors in BONK are being punished as the coin suffers from significant volatility.\n\nPentoshi, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst, said on X that \u201clate bulls [are being] punished on $bonk\u201d, noting that the coin had experienced a sharp drop of almost 50%. Despite the slump, BONK is still up 35% over the last seven days and 400% in the past 30 days.\n\nThe coin has been gaining popularity over the past few weeks, reaching a new all-time peak last week of $0.00003416. However, the latest data from CoinGecko shows that BONK\u2019s current price has fallen to $0.00001968, a drop of almost 42% in just a few days.\n\nLast week, Pentoshi had warned of the coin\u2019s volatility, stating, \u201cYou'll be able to buy $bonk 50% lower than its current price within 4-6 weeks. Even if it goes higher first.\u201d\n\nSee More: Dogecoin HODLERs Are Beating Shiba Inu With 57% Landing In Profits, IntoTheBlock Data Reveals\n\nWhy It Matters: Another cryptocurrency analyst, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, also suggests that BONK may soon undergo a correction.\n\n\"The bull market is barely under way and $BONK is doing a 200x. In the meantime, $SATS, $RATS, and similar tokens are following $BONK in their footsteps. Mental, but good signs that the market sentiment has shifted. Does it mean you should buy these? I wouldn\u2019t at this point,\" he tweeted.\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?"
