        "content": "FTX\u2019s Crypto Portfolio Worth $3.4B, Consists of $1.16B of Solana\n\nFTX's Crypto Portfolio Includes Solana Tokens\n\nBankrupt crypto exchange FTX has revealed in a court filing that its liquid crypto portfolio is worth $3.4 billion, which consists of $1.16 billion worth of Solana (SOL) tokens. The second-largest holding is Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $560 million, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at $196 million. Aptos (APT) makes up $136 million of FTX's portfolio.\n\nWithin its holdings, FTX's largest venture token investment is in Solana, valued at $137 million, with NEAR token as the second-largest investment at $80 million. In addition to these assets, FTX owns a separate stash of \"Category B\" crypto assets, which are assets that are not as liquid or are largely controlled by FTX or both. This includes 10 billion Serum (SRM) tokens and 269 million Mango (MNGO) tokens.\n\nDespite FTX's bankruptcy filing, Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko remains committed to the project, even as signs indicate that FTX's estate is preparing to liquidate its holdings.\n\nThe court document also details FTX's holdings, which include cryptocurrency, cash, government-recovered assets, and other investments. It includes information on payments made to past CEOs as well as political and charity contributions. These payments may be seized and allocated to creditors under US law.\n\nFTX's estate also includes 38 properties in the Bahamas worth a total of $222 million. These assets and holdings will be managed and distributed among FTX's creditors based on the court proceedings. FTX is currently seeking to claw back funds paid in celebrity deals and funds withdrawn by parties like LayerZero Labs."

        "content": "Solflare\u2019s Solana wallet is launching on MetaMask Snaps, new functionality from Consensys engineers that allows greater customization for MetaMask wallets.\n\nSolflare\u2019s integration means that SOL and Solana-based NFTs can be directly managed on MetaMask wallets. Solana dapps will also now available on MetaMask.\n\nSolflare co-founder Filip Dragoslavic said the development erases the friction of installing a new wallet, which has stopped many potential Solana users from interacting with the chain. Now, users can simply use MetaMask, which remains the most popular crypto wallet with over 100 million users.\n\n\u201cSolana has an incredibly vibrant ecosystem of apps of which many are only possible on Solana. This integration could be a game-changer to introduce the biggest user base in Web3 to just try Solana and see for themselves\u201d Dragoslavic said in a statement.\n\nSolflare is just one of 33 other third party developers that have developed Snaps to allow users to customize their notifications, get insights about transactions before they\u2019re signed, and customize their user interface.\n\nOther Snaps include Bitcoin-based Zion, StarkNet, WalletGuard, Sui Wallet and Aptos.\n\nRead more: MetaMask interoperable with Bitcoin for first time\n\nCurrently, the 34 total Snaps that are available were audited and allowlisted by Consensys, MetaMask\u2019s parent company. Eventually, this permissioned framework will become more reliant on a decentralized community, according to Christian Montoya, the senior product owner of MetaMask Snaps.\n\nThat community, instead of Consensys employees, will be responsible for vetting and approving new Snaps, Montoya told Blockworks.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

For BTC to not enter panic mode, $24,500 support remains sacrosanct. This is the level above which BTC has been trading for almost 6 months now. As for ETH, which fell 2.8%, the support of $1,600 has been breached and it is currently trading around $1,550,\" Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk said.In Hudda's opinion, a major catalyst for SOL\u2019s ($17.95) sell-off is still Wednesday's expectation of FTX unlock, pointing out that this cryptocurrency was already down by around 50% from its recent high in July. \"Additionally, given that a majority of the SOL is time-locked for FTX, we could very well see a 'sell the rumor, buy the news\u2019 event playing out on Tuesday,\" he added.Prospects of cryptocurrency, which has an inverse relationship with the US dollar, will be hinging upon the movement in the USD as investors in different asset classes await US CPI Data slated for release today, along with the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data and the retail sales data which is expected to be published on Thursday.Among the top-performing cryptocurrencies, MKR leads with a remarkable gain of 120%, followed by OMG with 35%, ZIL with 26% and MATIC with 15%. The biggest losers include ENS with a significant drop of 69%, WAVES with 64%, COTI with 38%, GNS with 28% and REP with 26%.\"The 'Three Black Crows' candlestick pattern on the 4-hour time frame signals a continuation of the bearish trend. Bitcoin is currently in oversold territory with indicators such as the RSI below 30 indicating an exhaustion of sellers, which may lead to a brief bullish correction before another downtrend.
