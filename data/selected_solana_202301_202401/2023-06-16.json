        "content": "A heated debate has sprouted within the Solana community as developers question the project\u2019s process of offering grants. If left unaddressed by Solana\u2019s top officials, the matter may create a rift within the ecosystem.\n\nHow It All Started\n\nIn July 2022, Maximilian Schneider, the co-founder of the Solana-based decentralized exchange Mango Markets, published a governance proposal addressing Solana\u2019s network congestion issue.\n\nMost projects built on the Solana mainnet help to ensure the project\u2019s smooth running. However, Mango Markets users complained about the blockchain network\u2019s lagging condition, like several other Solana-based protocols. Schneider noted in the proposal that his company\u2019s developers play a primary role in this regard:\n\n\u201cWe give up scarce resources and potentially contribute major improvements to Solana which doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a guaranteed success for Mango,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs a recovery plan, Schneider proposed that the Solana Foundation, a non-profit firm developing the Solana ecosystem, approve a grant of 1,000,000 SOL to \u201chonor the contributions Mango developers will make\u201d to improve the Solana network performance and onboard more hands full-time. He outlined that the grant would be split into 10 batches and be released over five years only through the continued approval of the Foundation.\n\nSolana Community Disagrees\n\nWhile Mango users who commented on the proposal post supported the idea, broader Solana community members did not endorse the idea. Many stressed that the amount of SOL in question was too high. According to SOL\u2019s current price, one million SOL coins will be $14 million.\n\nOthers cited Mango as being incompetent for the job as it once suffered a security breach where a hacker stole over $100 million from the protocol. The community members stated that if Mango should get a million SOL, other Solana-based projects like Jump Crypto should receive as much as 100 million SOL.\n\nSuspecting the request from Mango Markets to be an insider transaction, a community member challenged the Solana Foundation as not being straightforward with its grants program, which is designed to fund growing business models.\n\nStill, Solana Foundation\u2019s Head of Strategy, Austin Federa, echoed the proposal from Mango is yet to be approved by Solana Foundation executives. He added that Solana\u2019s grant program works well, and anyone interested should follow due process."

        "title": "Bakkt delists Solana, Polygon, and Cardano, citing lack of regulatory clarity - Fortune",
        "content": "Just over two months after completing a $155 million acquisition of trading infrastructure provider Apex Crypto, the New York\u2013based digital assets platform Bakkt is delisting three of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap: Solana, Polygon, and Cardano.\n\nBakkt general counsel and secretary Marc D\u2019Annunzio told Fortune in a statement the company was taking proactive measures \u201cuntil there is further clarity on how to compliantly offer a more extensive list of coins.\u201d\n\nThe decision comes a week after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, alleging that both crypto exchanges were offering unregistered securities to customers. In the complaints, the SEC alleged for the first time that Solana\u2019s SOL, Polygon\u2019s MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA are securities.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s expanded definition has spurred crypto platforms to revisit which tokens they list. Robinhood\u2019s chief legal compliance officer told Congress the day of the Coinbase lawsuit that the trading app was actively reviewing its offerings. Robinhood delisted SOL, ADA, and MATIC three days later.\n\nBakkt is now following suit. The publicly listed company\u2014initially launched by Intercontinental Exchange, operator of the New York Stock Exchange, in 2018\u2014has taken a compliance-first approach. After cycling through different business models, it now focuses on a turnkey service that helps other fintech platforms, such as Webull and Public.com, set up crypto trading.\n\nAfter offering only Bitcoin and Ethereum, Bakkt\u2019s acquisition of Apex Crypto allowed it to expand the cryptocurrencies available to its customers. Wary of regulators, Bakkt began to reduce the list of tokens that would come over from Apex. During the due diligence process, Bakkt had Apex Crypto delist seven tokens, including the failed Terra and the privacy coin Zcash.\n\nAfter the acquisition was completed in early April, Bakkt delisted an additional two tokens\u2014Algorand\u2019s ALGO and Decentraland\u2019s MANA\u2014the day after they were named as securities in an SEC lawsuit against Bittrex. Then in May, Bakkt delisted 25 of its remaining 36 tokens, with a spokesperson attributing the decision to its \u201cregular coin-listing review process\u201d and the \u201cmost up-to-date regulatory guidance.\u201d\n\nThe latest delisting reflects the increasingly hostile crypto environment in the U.S., as firms try to navigate an evolving regulatory landscape shaped by the aggressive SEC. Bakkt still offers eight other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, Litecoin, USDC, and Shiba Inu, along with Bitcoin and Ether.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine to tell me where I can\u2019t stand,\u201d Gavin Michael, Bakkt\u2019s CEO, told Fortune in an interview. \u201cBut you have to tell me how to operate.\u201d\n\nA timeline of Bakkt token delists.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a security?\n\nThe question of whether cryptocurrencies should be regulated as securities or commodities has become central to the industry in the U.S., with the SEC butting heads with operators on if\u2014and how\u2014firms should register with the agency.\n\nIn its recent spate of enforcement actions, the SEC has targeted platforms for selling tokens that the agency deems unregistered securities, with Chair Gary Gensler arguing the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, with the exception of Bitcoin, are securities. Crypto firms, in response, say that there is no viable path for registering securities or platforms with the SEC.\n\nWhenever the SEC describes a new token as a security in a lawsuit, it causes a ripple effect across the U.S. crypto ecosystem\u2014a phenomenon described by many as \u201cregulation by enforcement.\u201d Michael said one of the reasons that Bakkt decided to delist MANA and ALGO following the Bittrex lawsuit is that liquidity providers stopped supporting the two tokens, meaning Bakkt could no longer offer a competitive depth of market.\n\nDespite the threat of SEC action, Bakkt chief product officer Dan O\u2019Prey said that a committee weighs myriad factors in a monthly process when deciding whether to continue listing tokens. Considerations include whether the token is a privacy coin, whether it is used for money laundering, and whether there have been hacks or other security issues. Other determinants include a token\u2019s liquidity and trading volumes, as well as the likelihood it will be alleged to be a security by the SEC. For the latter, Bakkt applies legal standards like the Howey test, along with looking at whether similar tokens have been named as securities.\n\nBakkt\u2019s proactive decision in May to delist 25 tokens proved to be prescient, with one\u2014Filecoin\u2014later included as a security in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance.\n\n\u201cThat was a big piece of why we did the 25, because we didn\u2019t want to have to be constantly reacting,\u201d O\u2019Prey said, adding that Bakkt had \u201cnever [been] under the illusion that it would be a perfect number.\u201d\n\nHe said that some of Bakkt\u2019s partners are changing their preferences, including only listing Bitcoin and Ether, while others aren\u2019t impacted by SEC actions. The company plans to expand its custody offerings to include other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nMichael, the CEO, said Bakkt will continue to work with regulators on compliance but understands that further challenges are likely.\n\n\u201cGiven everything we\u2019ve been through over the last year and a half, it takes a lot to get surprised these days,\u201d he told Fortune."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Friday morning trading in Asia, after falling below US$25,000 overnight and overall posting a losing week, a trend mirrored by Ether. The rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed after finding little impetus from the U.S. Fed decision in the week to leave interest rates unchanged. Polygon\u2019s Matic token had the biggest decline in the top 10 amid sharp falls in altcoins since the U.S. regulator last week labeled many of them illegally issued financial securities.\n\nBumpy week\n\nBitcoin added 2.05% over the last 24 hours to US$25,573.56 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 3.83% in the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about US$497 billion, slipped to US$24,797.17 at around 8:00 p.m. on Thursday, the lowest since March 16.\n\nEther traded little changed at US$1,665.73, up a slight 0.78%, but posting a weekly loss of 10.06%.\n\nSolana led gains among the top 10 tokens by market capitalization, rising 3% to US$14.88, but still down 21.58% for the past seven days. The Solana community on Twitter is throwing around the idea of a hard fork to avoid further scrutiny from U.S. regulators, but such an idea is not being discussed among Solana developers, according to Decrypt.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic was the biggest loser out of the top 10, dropping 4.06% to US$0.5952 to bring the week\u2019s loss to 24.06%.\n\nMost of the top 10 have been on a roller-coaster ride since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) filed lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance.US and Coinbase in the week of June 5. The SEC also named dozens of altcoins as financial securities, including Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB.\n\nThose four tokens combined had a market capitalization of US$57.5 billion as of Friday morning in Asia, which is a sharp 26.5% slump from the US$78.27 billion prior to the SEC\u2019s lawsuits.\n\n\u201cMany notable altcoins, such as Matic, were listed as securities in recent SEC lawsuits, so venture capital firms have been selling their altcoin holdings to capture the little liquidity left and lessen the blow to their portfolios,\u201d said Nick Ruck, the chief operating officer of blockchain venture studio ContentFi Lab, in a Telegram message to Forkast.\n\n\u201cInstitutions are managing portfolio risk and preparing for a continued downtrend amid less market liquidity and tighter regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nIn related moves, U.S.-based trading platform Robinhood delisted Cardano, Polygon and Solana, while the eToro platform halted user purchases of Polygon, Decentraland, Algorand and Dash \u2014 which were all named in the SEC\u2019s legal filings.\n\nThe crypto market seemed to find little relief in the move this week by the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate increases.\n\n\u201cThis pause, or skip seems to be a more tactical move, but the fight against inflation is not over yet,\u201d said Michiel Janssen, trader and analyst at crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, in an email statement shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201cFor crypto this means in the short term that there is less money flowing into the crypto markets. In the longer run, higher inflation and further problems in the banking sector can be a positive for crypto.\u201d\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap increased 1.21% to US$1.04 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 18.55% to US$37.82 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cGrails\u201d sales hit US$17 million\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 1.39% to 2,884.87 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.46% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions fell 25.96% to US$18.58 million. Transaction on Ethereum, the leading NFT blockchain, dropped 10.50% to US$13.2 million.\n\nTransactions on the Bitcoin network, the second largest NFT blockchain, plunged 72.91% to US$1.12 million.\n\nOn Thursday, global auction house Sotheby\u2019s finished its second round of sales of NFTs from the \u201cGrails\u201d collection. \u201cGrails\u201d consists of non-fungible token (NFT) artwork that belongs to the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and its NFT-purchasing fund Starry Night Capital.\n\nSingapore-based Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that once managed as much as US$10 billion, filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in July 2022, which protects assets of insolvent foreign debtors from U.S. creditors.\n\nIn February this year, Three Arrows Capital\u2019s U.S.-based liquidator Teneo said that it plans to sell NFTs owned by the company with an estimated value of US$22 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe second auction brought in nearly US$11 million in sales, including Dmitri Cherniak\u2019s \u201cThe Goose\u201d or Ringers #879, which was sold for US$6.2 million alone. The collection has raised a running total of US$17 million in Sotheby\u2019s sales.\n\n\u201cWhile the NFT community is excited by today\u2019s major art sales from the Sotheby\u2019s auction, that isn\u2019t money that will flow back into NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cThese were seized NFTs from 3AC and that money will go to recouping losses.\u201d\n\nIn other transactions, the NFT staple Bored Ape Yacht Club topped sales by collection, selling US$1.11 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nMythos chain-powered DMarket game NFTs came second with US$899,694 in sales, with over 51,000 transactions in the past day.\n\nU.S. stock futures drop after Thursday rally\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures fell as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after rallying during the regular trading day on Thursday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.15%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.21% lower and Nasdaq Futures lost 0.33%.\n\nThe Dow rose 1.26% on Thursday, S&P gained 1.22% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.15% as optimism grew that the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes are near the peak, according to Trading Economics.\n\nThe U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% after its meeting on Wednesday. The rate is at its highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage last year. The central bank warned of two more rate hikes by the end of 2023.\n\nThe European Central Bank raised its interest rates for the eighth consecutive time on Thursday, adding 25 basis points.\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for July 25 to 26.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at July\u2019s meeting, while 71.9% says the Fed will raise by 25 basis points.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "title": "SEC's Crypto Crackdown: What it means for investors and the future - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Crypto Crackdowns\n\n\n\nRegulatory compliance\n\nInvestor protection\n\nImpact on investment returns\n\nFuture of cryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, investment opportunities were primarily limited to traditional assets like real estate, commodities, bank deposits and stocks.However, the dawn of digital era has paved the way for a fresh wave of investments options, with cryptocurrencies being the most prominent digital asset. Despite initial hesitations and uncertainties surrounding unregulated assets, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have garnered notable momentum and exhibited increasing competitiveness in daily returns, particularly in the Indian market.Furthermore, the Government of India in a recent G20 summit has published a comprehensive report that sheds light on the willingness of numerous countries to adopt and legitimize cryptocurrencies, ultimately augmenting their accessibility. Within this context, India has firmly established itself as the seventh-largest nation, poised to embrace cryptocurrencies in the coming years and beyond.Undoubtedly, as the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to surge, India has solidified its position as a global frontrunner in embracing and integrating the digital currencies into its financial landscape.With the ever-increasing traction in India, a diverse array of businesses, young individuals, and first-time investors have developed a fervent interest in venturing into this digital landscape.According to data released by KuCoin, a global cryptocurrency exchange, despite the government's initial skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, India is estimated to have an astounding 115 million investors, all propelled by a collective aspiration for long-term gains.This comprehensive report not only illuminates the burgeoning prevalence of cryptocurrency adoption but also emphasizes that a significant 56% of investors believe cryptocurrencies will fundamentally shape the future of the financial ecosystem.So, before diving into the future of cryptocurrencies, it is better to understand what it means for investors and its avenues for desired results.While digital assets offer numerous advantages, they also raise specific concerns, including the risk of fraud, market manipulation, money laundering, security vulnerabilities, and the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.Thus, in order to address fraudulent and unlawful activities, cryptocurrency crackdown that involves the implementation of regulations, increased oversight, and the imposition of penalties in the segment, appeared as a rigorous approach. This regulation aims to bolster investor protection and uphold the market's integrity.In addition, recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission 's (SEC's) crypto crackdown has significant implications for investors and the future currencies. The SEC regulates securities offerings and protects investors in the United States.While cryptocurrencies are not classified as traditional securities, the SEC has taken steps to assert its authority and regulate certain aspects of the crypto market. It is, thus, safe to say that with this uncertainty, there is a possibility for market fluctuation in India too. So, let's delve into the potential aspect and what investors need to consider before investing in cryptocurrency.A cryptocurrency crackdown typically entails the introduction of more strict regulations and compliance requirements. In this context, investors may be required to adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, furnish additional documentation, and fulfill reporting obligations. As a result, this may heighten administrative burdens and lead to more stringent compliance requirements for crypto projects, potentially impacting their operations and raising barriers to entry for new projects.The protection of investors emerges as a primary goal of regulatory crackdowns, aiming to safeguard them against the inherent risks posed by fraud, scams, and illicit activities in the cryptocurrency market. Through the implementation of stricter regulations, a multitude of enhanced measures can be introduced to reinforce investor protection.These measures encompass a comprehensive range of disclosure requirements, thereby promoting increased transparency and instilling heightened confidence among investors. Furthermore, strengthened safeguards are established to counteract fraudulent practices, effectively establishing a fortified investment environment that fosters trust and security for individuals venturing into the dynamic realm of cryptocurrencies.The impact on investment returns resulting from a cryptocurrency crackdown may introduce uncertainty in the immediate aftermath.Regulatory interventions and the prevailing market sentiment have the potential to trigger short-term price fluctuations, possibly leading to market corrections. Nevertheless, when viewed holistically, a diligently regulated and unwavering market can offer investors a more promising investment landscape over the long haul. This steadfastness and regulatory oversight evoke heightened confidence and establish the foundation for a sustainable and thriving market, ultimately presenting investors with amplified.On the other hand, regulatory actions may also create short-term volatility and uncertainty in the market. This, in turn, could impact the overall growth and future adoption of cryptocurrencies.Thus, investors need to stay informed about the regulatory landscape, comply with the applicable regulations, and conduct thorough due diligence before making investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market. Moreover, seeking professional advice from financial and legal experts can help navigate the evolving regulatory environment and assess the potential impact on investment strategies.The outlook for cryptocurrency in India for investors during a crackdown is uncertain and contingent upon multiple elements. SEC's crackdowns may introduce initial obstacles, their primary objective is establishing a secure industry foundation. Investors may encounter short-term market volatility and heightened compliance obligations, affecting prices and the confidentiality of transactions.Nevertheless, crackdowns safeguard investors against fraud and illicit activities, bolstering confidence and attracting institutional investors to facilitate long-term market expansion. According to Statista, the cryptocurrency market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.83% to reach $324 million by 2027.In addition, the formulation of clear guidelines can stimulate innovation and responsible conduct, culminating in a sustainable investment environment. Despite direct uncertainties, the crackdown is anticipated to yield a regulated and mature cryptocurrency market, presenting growth prospects for compliant investors. Thus, in order to get long-term growth, investors need to focus on a trusted advisor before investing in cryptocurrency.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
