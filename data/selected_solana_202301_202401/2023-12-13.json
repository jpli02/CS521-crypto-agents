        "content": "Jet protocol, a Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) project, announced on Tuesday that it is shutting down operations. Users are urged to withdraw their funds from the project before its wind-down occurs on February 1st, 2024.\n\nWhat is Jet Protocol?\n\nJet protocol is a DeFi project that offers lending and borrowing for cryptocurrencies. It also enables token swaps and a margin system. Launched in May 2021, the project is developed by U.S.-based company Jet Protocol Holdings, LLC. It has also garnered attention from investors.\n\nFollowing the project\u2019s launch on-chain, it garnered over $38 million in total value locked (TVL) in November 2021, as revealed by the blockchain analytics platform, DeFiLlama. Since then, the protocol\u2019s TVL has gradually diminished.\n\nCurrent data shows that the TVL has plunged to as low as $325,000, accompanied by a market capitalization of around $636,000.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nWhy is Jet Protocol Shutting Down?\n\nIn a community update shared by the project\u2019s co-founder James Moreau, Jet protocol is shutting down due to a lack of funds to continue its business. Other entities tied to the project will shut down too. For example, Jet protocol\u2019s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and its development company Jet Protocol Holdings, LLC, will close down as well.\n\nIn August, Jet protocol had already begun to downsize its workforce due to a lack of ability to pay workers. Since then, the remaining funds are being used to \u201coperate the front end and back end hosting services, RPC services and other operating expenses.\u201d\n\nFollowing the wind down, the project\u2019s codes will be open-sourced, allowing other developers to build and enhance Jet protocol\u2019s suite of products. Moreau urged users to \u201cfork the code.\u201d\n\nWhile users are urged to pull their funds from the project, the co-founder noted that assets still in the protocol after February 1st will be left there."
