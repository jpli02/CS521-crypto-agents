        "content": "Polygon has a similar system of defining a block leader through its Bor protocol, but the approach to scaling is different. Polygon is set up to scale by adding more sidechains running in parallel and merging state periodically through a commitment to Ethereum. That\u2019s why you may see Polygon POS and Plasma referred to as a \u201ccommit chain.\u201d Multiple, parallel sidechains may mean it\u2019s possible for two users to be on separate sidechains using the same app, which would mean users are beholden to the latency of the state merge between chains and developers have to build for complexity."

        "content": "The first customers have received the Saga model, the first batch of Solana phones. It is an entirely Android-compatible smartphone with extra features for interacting with the Solana blockchain, as was to be expected.\n\nHaving said that, it\u2019s possible that Saga will go above and beyond what has already been announced in regard to BONK, which the official SOL Mobile account has suggested might be burned.\n\nStay tuned \u2014 Solana Mobile 2\ufe0f\u20e3 (@solanamobile) January 4, 2023\n\nWill Solana incorporate BONK Inu burns?\n\nThe official Twitter account has also made hints about the potential to buy Saga in exchange for a meme token, in addition to the potential to burn the Bonk Inu token using Solana\u2019s phone features.\n\nA new meme coin called Bonk Inu (BONK) is a sort of Solana-based successor to Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Even though the hype surrounding it only recently increased, the token has already increased by 5.351%.\n\nNumerous Solana-based projects and even official blockchain accounts are actively promoting it at the same time. BONK has a monstrously enormous token supply of 99.185 trillion, just like Shiba Inu. Similar to SHIB, it is suggested to burn the Bonk Inu token to lower the number of zeros.\n\nOver half of the 815 billion BONKs burned to date were intended for the DeGods team, Solana\u2019s most well-known NFT collection. However, the Bonk Inu team retaliated by setting fire to their BONKs after the DeGods team left their blockchain after failing to reach an agreement with SOL.\n\nOn January 4, WU Blockchain reported that the well-known Meme token BONK had overtaken USDC and SOL as the token with the ecosystem\u2019s highest 24-hour trading volume.\n\nBONK is a decentralized cryptocurrency that was developed for and by the SOL community. The community received a 50% airdrop of the cryptocurrency\u2019s total supply.\n\nAccording to Bonk\u2019s one-pager, the project\u2019s developers were dissatisfied with \u201cAlameda\u2019s\u201d toxic tokenomics and desired to develop a more welcoming and enjoyable meme coin where everyone would have an equal chance to participate."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDeLabs, the startup behind top Solana NFT collections DeGods and y00ts, has revealed that it received a $3 million grant to move y00ts to the Ethereum sidechain Polygon.\n\nAccording to a statement published on Discord by founder Frank, aka Rohun Vora, DeLabs will put the funds toward hiring efforts and launch a crypto incubator to support its NFT ecosystem.\n\nY00ts are a spinoff profile picture NFT collection from the DeLabs team, which first found success with its DeGods PFP collection on Solana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe money seems to come with no strings attached besides the promised move to the new blockchain. Frank said the funds are coming in as a \u201cnon-equity grant,\u201d meaning Polygon is not receiving a stake in DeLabs in exchange.\n\nHere is a screenshot of our latest @y00tsNFT Discord announcement. pic.twitter.com/qWxjBsexv6 \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) January 6, 2023\n\n\u201cDeLabs as a company has been understaffed for a while,\u201d said the DeLabs founder. \u201cSecuring extended runway with non-dilutive capital is huge for us, because it means we can be a little less conservative in our monthly burn.\u201d\n\nWhile Polygon has not yet publicized the y00ts grant sum on its own social channels, the firm is supportive of Frank\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cPolygon fully supports Frank and the y00ts team\u2019s dedication to transparency and we look forward to all of the projects that will build on Polygon via their launchpad,\u201d a Polygon spokesperson told Decrypt via email.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\ny00ts will officially bridge to @0xPolygon in Q1 2023. pic.twitter.com/Mnz25dJko1 \u2014 y00ts (@y00tsNFT) December 25, 2022\n\nDeLabs\u2019 move away from Solana to Polygon and Ethereum comes just a month after the collapse of FTX. The company\u2019s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was a major investor in Solana and various projects building on the network, including the now-defunct decentralized exchange Serum. Bankman-Fried and FTX built Serum, which at its height was the backbone of all DeFi activity on Solana.\n\nSOL is down 6.5% in the past month and down 91% in the past year, per CoinGecko data.\n\nBut Polygon wasn\u2019t DeLabs\u2019 only option for y00ts. Frank said that \u201cmuch larger offers\u201d had been under consideration but that DeLabs chose Polygon for y00ts because \u201cit\u2019s the most exciting direction for y00ts as a project.\u201d\n\nPolygon has secured deals with major brands such as Starbucks, Coca-Cola, and Disney. Frank has teased that y00ts will play a role in those big-brand partnerships on Polygon in the future."

        "content": "Solana, known as the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d, is the first blockchain to introduce a Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism. Photo: FellowNeko / Shutterstock\n\nOnce a top cryptocurrency, now struggling to stay afloat, Solana (SOL) blockchain\u2019s native token lost over 70% of its value since November 2022 following the demise of the FTX crypto exchange.\n\nWith Sam Bankman-Fried being a prominent early investor, who has the most solana coins as the coin is suffering through a bear market? Here we take a look at the biggest solana holders.\n\nSOL/USD live price\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nSolana, known as the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d, is the first blockchain to introduce a Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism that fastens operations while keeping them secure and decentralised.\n\nThe platform was founded in 2017 by former Qualcomm (QCOM) employee and Dropbox software engineer Anatoly Yakovenko and his colleague Greg Fitzgerald. The founders aimed to create an open-source project that implemented a new, high-performance permissionless blockchain.\n\nUnlike the algorithms used by major blockchains, like Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), PoH can process over 250,000 transactions per second with the goal to process over 710,000 transactions per second.\n\nIt is important to note that Solana does not solely use a PoH consensus mechanism but incorporates a mix of PoH\u2019s timing mechanism and PoS\u2019s protocol structure. This is what helps the blockchain conduct fast transactions, be more scalable and not rely on Layer2 systems for sharding.\n\nAccording to Solana\u2019s website, the blockchain prides itself in being:\n\nFast : the platform claims to have block times of 400 milliseconds and will continue to increase speed as it develops.\n\nDecentralised : the network is validated by thousands of nodes that operate independently. This ensures that user data is safe and free of censorship.\n\nScalable : the platform is made \u201cto handle thousands of transactions per second\u201d. Fees remain less than $0.01 for both developers and users.\n\nEnergy efficient: the blockchain was able to minimise its environmental impact due to its PoS protocol structure resulting in a 0% net carbon impact.\n\nMoreover, Solana users can:\n\nMint, sell and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nCreate their own decentralised finance (DeFi) projects and write smart contracts.\n\nBuild Web3 games.\n\nAccept payments in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum network. The cryptocurrency is used to pay for transaction fees and any purchases in the Solana ecosystem and staking.\n\nWhat is your sentiment on SOL/USD? 168.1474 Bullish or Bearish Vote to see Traders sentiment! Market sentiment: Bullish Bearish 95% 5% You voted bullish. You voted bearish. Give SOL/USD a try Start trading Start trading Start trading or Try demo\n\nWho owns the most solana?\n\nAccording to data provided by CoinMarketCap, SOL has an unlimited maximum supply and a total token supply surpassing 537 million coins. This makes the token an inflationary coin, while cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) are deflationary because they have a limit on how many tokens can be mined.\n\nAs of 6 January 2023, the token had a circulating supply surpassing 367 million coins and a market capitalisation of $5.03bn.\n\nInitially, the cryptocurrency was distributed in five different funding rounds, four of which were private sales. SOL\u2019s initial supply was 500 million tokens and the cryptocurrency\u2019s initial token distribution is as follows:\n\n15.86% went to Seed Round investors\n\n2.63% went to Founding Sale investors\n\n5.07% went to Validator Sale investors\n\n1.84% went to Strategic Sale investors\n\n1.6% went to Public Auction Sale investors\n\n12.5% went to team members\n\n12.5% went to the Solana Foundation\n\n38% went to the Community reserve fund which is managed by the Solana Foundation\n\nSo, who owns the most solana today?\n\nAccording to data on CoinCarp as of 6 January 2023 there were 9,154,449 wallets holding solana tokens. The cryptocurrency\u2019s ownership was fragmented with single wallet addresses holding a minimum amount of the token\u2019s total supply.\n\nAccording to data collected by the website, the 10 top holders of solana collectively owned 9.06% of the total token supply while the 100 biggest solana holders owned over 33% of the total coin supply.\n\nThe 100 richest solana holders on CoinCarp were anonymous wallets, which makes it harder to speculate who owns the most solana. The biggest SOL wallet owned 1.86% of the coin\u2019s total token supply which amounted to over 9.5 million coins.\n\nThe other four top solana holders were:\n\nAn anonymous wallet held 0.93% of the total supply or 4.7 million coins.\n\nAn anonymous wallet held 0.93% of the total supply or 4.7 million coins.\n\nAn anonymous wallet held 0.90% of the total supply or 4.6 million coins.\n\nAn anonymous wallet held 0.88% of the total supply or 4.5 million coins.\n\nThe most prominent movements across the 100 largest wallets holding SOL tokens in the last week include a gain of over 800,000 SOL coins by the biggest wallet.\n\nIs Sam Bankman-Fried the biggest SOL holder?\n\nPrior to FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, Alameda Research, the crypto exchange platform\u2019s sister hedge fund, held over $1.19 billion SOL tokens according to reports by CoinDesk , as the platform\u2019s founder Sam Bankman-Fried was an early investor of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs of 6 January 2023, Alameda was said to still hold over 48 million locked and staked SOL tokens representing 66.1% of all locked stake, data on Solana Compass showed. Meanwhile, a report published by the Daily Hodl suggested that these holdings may be in the hands of liquidators.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for SOL?\n\nSome of the biggest news affecting SOL\u2019s performance continue to be closely related to the downfall of the FTX crypto exchange and its close relationship to the cryptocurrency.\n\nA tweet published by crypto reporter Wu Blockchain on 29 December 2022 noted that the asset management platform Matrixpot decided to delist SOL and SOL-U dual-currency from its platform starting from 30 December and said it will no longer be launching any new Solana products.\n\nMatrixport, the asset management platform founded by Jihan Wu, announced that it will delist SOL and SOL-U dual-currency investment products on December 30, and will not launch new Solana products in the future. \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 29, 2022\n\nThe demise of the FTX platform forced SOL to lose over 70% of its value dropping down to $9.7558 as of 29 December 2022 from a high of $33.78 on 5 November 2022.\n\nIn addition, the Solana NFT project DeGods announced on 26 December 2022 that it would \u201cofficially bridge Ethereum in Q1 of 2023\u201d and leave the Solana blockchain for good. The Y00ts NFT project made a similar announcement saying that it \u201cwill officially bridge to Polygon in Q1 2023\u201d.\n\nAlthough it may not be all bad for the cryptocurrency as it gained some support from Ethereum (ETH) co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, who tweeted on 29 December 2022 that the blockchain has a \u201cbright future\u201d. This helped the SOL token gain some momentum surging by about 35% to $13.18 as of 6 January 2023.\n\nSome smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future.\n\n\n\nHard for me to tell from outside, but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive???????? \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 29, 2022\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nNote that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, and should be traded with caution. This article on who owns the most solana does not constitute investment advice. You should always conduct your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest news, fundamental and technical analysis, and a wide range of analyst commentary.\n\nRemember, past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade more money than you can afford to lose.\n\nFAQs"
