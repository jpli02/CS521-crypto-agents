        "content": "No, many believe that it is unlikely for Solana to reach $1,000 in 2025. While it's impossible to predict with absolute certainty due to the inherent volatility of the crypto market, there are several reasons that some people are still optimistic about Solana. As Solana continues to attract more developers and projects thanks to its high transaction speed and low fees, this increased utility could create more use cases for Solana. Additionally, the transition towards a more decentralized and digital economy might also bolster the value of blockchain platforms like Solana. That said, predicting the exact price of Solana by 2025 is out of the realm of possibility as the price of Solana, like all cryptocurrencies, is subject to a plethora of highly unpredictable conditions."

        "content": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong urges the crypto community to work on making crypto payments instant and free globally. Bitcoin maximalists including Block co-founder Jack Dorsey, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, and others replied asking Coinbase to integrate Bitcoin Lightning Network on the exchange. However, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko argues Solana is faster and cheaper than Lightning Network for payments.\n\nBitcoin Lightning Support on Coinbase\n\nAfter recent efforts for clear crypto regulations, Brian Armstrong on July 27 said the next step for crypto is making crypto payments instant and free globally. The community needs to speed up getting Layer 2 integration, better on-ramps, and simplify crypto onboarding to aim for making payments under 1 cent and settling under 1 second. He hints are using USTC stablecoins for transactions.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cToday, crypto has the *potential* to improve global payments infrastructure, but it hasn\u2019t yet delivered on that promise as we\u2019re largely still stuck on layer 1. Payments are like water, they flow to the path of least resistance.\u201d\n\nJack Dorsey and Michael Saylor recommend integrating Bitcoin Lightning Network on Coinbase for faster payments and better infrastructure.\n\nSolana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko argues that USDC on Solana is cheaper than Bitcoin Lightning Network, with an average confirmation time of just 1.3 seconds. The Solana community also supported Yakovenko\u2019s facts about Solana Pay.\n\nAs the House Republicans and some Democrats approve a crypto bill for stablecoins payments and market structure, payments using USDC are likely to boost.

        "content": "A closely followed strategist is predicting that one Ethereum (ETH) rival will repeat the competitor\u2019s parabolic rally from the last crypto cycle.\n\nPseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse, also known as Cantering Clark, tells his 179,700 Twitter followers that Solana (SOL) is mirroring the price action of ETH before a massive move to the upside.\n\n\u201cIn a private group (can\u2019t dox Excel chart of picks or people), my pick for the best-performing coin of the bounce this year was SOL. The idea that a darling of the last cycle would do very well. I shared this chart of the beginnings of ETH vs. SOL, and I still think SOL probably does more or less the same. The cheering got pretty loud for this one.\u201d\n\nAccording to his chart, SOL\u2019s recent price action to the $27 level mirrors ETH\u2019s sudden move to $280 in 2020. ETH then went on a parabolic rally, which he says SOL will likely mirror as well.\n\nSolana is trading for $25.23 at time of writing, up 8.7% during the last 24 hours.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH and says that the top two performing digital assets are in an uptrend with most investors taking long positions and accumulating.\n\n\u201cI think I have probably beat this drum during every stream, and weekly here on Twitter now for the last six months. The view around BTC, ETH, and a handful of others is much longer now. Spot bags are built and there are no outright shorts. Everything short is trading around a core position.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $29,459 at time of writing, up 0.8% in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum is worth $1,868, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso on the trader\u2019s radar is the declining market cap of stablecoins, which indicates a decline in liquidity in the overall crypto markets.\n\nHe says that the market cap of stablecoins will likely start to increase either when there is an approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) or the halving event expected in April of next year when miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half.\n\n\u201cCryptos own money supply. We aren\u2019t there yet and we need a catalyst.\n\nBlackRock ETF could be it. Halving is a close second.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading higher on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve announced that it will increase the interest rates by 25 basis points, which was on the expected lines. However, the US central lender said that it is open to push rates again, if need be, which capped the gains in the digital assets.\n\n\n\nBitcoin extended its gains on Thursday as the largest crypto token added as much as a per cent but remained below 29,500-mark. However, Its largest peer, Ethereum outperformed and gained more than a per cent but it also remained below $1,900-levels. Price in the action altcoins was on the higher side.\n\n\n\nAfter the US Federal Reserve raised its interest rates by 25 basis points, as anticipated by the market, most cryptocurrencies experienced a slight increase. This rate hike was the highest since 2001, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin, which had dipped to a low of $29,097 on Tuesday, has now shown signs of recovery and is trading above the $29,400 mark. However, to fend off the aggressive bears, the bulls need to drive the price back up and maintain it above the $31,000 threshold. Meanwhile, Ethereum was observed being traded at the $1,870 level,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all other top crypto tokens were trading higher on Thursday. Solana surged about 6 per cent, while Polygon and Bitcoin Cash added 3 per cent each. Cardano, Litcoin and Polkadot rose 2 per cent each for the day. Among the laggards, Toncoin shed 4 per cent and Dogecoin was down over 2 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading quite higher, rising down to $1.19 trillion-mark as it gained about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes jumped more than 16 per cent to $30.56 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has remained relatively stagnant, stuck below the $30,000 level, primarily due to apprehension surrounding the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on rate hike, which is widely expected to include a 25-basis point. Bitcoin investment products suffered a $13 million outflow last week, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"XRP has emerged as the most traded altcoin of 2023 so far, with a record-breaking $150 billion trading volume. The crypto has benefited from the recent court ruling that it is not a security, capturing the attention of traders worldwide and signaling a potential shift in how crypto assets are perceived and regulated,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nClover Finance, also known as Clover, functions as a blockchain operating system that offers a comprehensive and user-friendly blockchain infrastructure. It includes a framework compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for Substrate-based applications, providing a convenient all-in-one solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the weekly time period, the CLV/USDT trend has broken out of the descending triangle pattern with a jump in trading volumes. The token has gained over 2% in the last 24 hours. The price is expected to have a positive trajectory in the coming days. The next resistance is expected at $0.57 and an immediate support is expected at $0.36 levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Solana's compressed NFTs open doors to new distribution models - Blockworks",
        "content": "The NFT narrative once centered on a small group of crypto-rich individuals flaunting their success with incomprehensibly expensive digital assets, exclusive to their wallet addresses.\n\nThat narrative has flipped with compressed NFTs, according to the co-founders of Solana-based NFT market Tensor. Now, they say it\u2019s all about making distribution as cheap as possible in order to attract as many people as possible to the market.\n\nIlja Moisejevs and Richard Wu talk to Blockworks on the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple) about the highly efficient approach to digital asset creation and how it will change the market.\n\nExplained in detail on Solana\u2019s official website, a compressed NFT uses \u201cstate compression,\u201d which \u201ctakes advantage of Merkle trees\u201d to reduce the required data into a \u201chash\u201d or \u201cfingerprint,\u201d stored in the Solana ledger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the cheapest possible way in crypto to create an NFT,\u201d says Moisejevs.\n\nConsumer behavior all goes back to cost, he says. Whether it\u2019s calling an Uber, staying in an AirBnB or skipping the dishes, behaviors change when things are cheaper. Making assets cost next to nothing enables a broad range of new distribution models and expands the market\u2019s potential size, Moisejevs says.\n\nTensor is among the first pioneers to test out compressed NFTs, so the founders have developed a few ideas regarding their use-cases. \u201cThese will be used without thought in every single crypto consumer app at some point,\u201d Wu says confidently.\n\nWu says compressed NFTs unlock the ability for consumer applications to experiment with possibilities, freed from the burden of creation costs. The boost in efficiency has sparked a variety of new possibilities, he says.\n\nDialect, a wallet-to-wallet messaging app, he says as an example, offers the ability to send and receive collectible NFT \u201cstickers.\u201d Even though the minting cost is negligible, \u201cit\u2019s still worth something,\u201d Wu says, \u201cbecause there\u2019s a limited quantity and you can trade them back and forth.\u201d\n\nDrip Haus airdrops NFTs in the thousands for free to subscribers \u2014 an impossibility for creators on the Ethereum side of the digital asset equation. \u201cThink about any consumer app in Web2 that\u2019s remotely useful, that has some notion of something that you could perhaps own, something that you could perhaps collect and show off,\u201d Wu says.\n\n\u201cAll of these will eventually use NFTs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt only makes sense for them to use compressed NFTs because of the cost.\u201d\n\nAdded complexities\n\nMoisejevs admits that the compression technology adds complexity to the developer experience, requiring \u201cvery close cooperation\u201d between the RPC provider and the app-builder. The two parties are \u201cconstantly going back and forth and resolving issues,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause this technology spans the infrastructure stack as much as it spans the app stack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really need these two teams working in tandem. When it comes to a solo developer that just wants to spin up a fun little app for a hackathon, this is going to be a lot harder to do than it would be to do with normal NFTs.\u201d\n\nWu notes that, as is often the case with low-cost platforms, spam will be an issue that needs to be addressed by developers. \u201cThey\u2019re so cheap to make, people don\u2019t even think about how much it costs to send someone one of these compressed NFTs or to create a thousand compressed NFTs.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will be getting thousands, tens of thousands of these compressed NFTs,\u201d he says, which will be a technical challenge for wallet and RPC providers. Marketplaces like Tensor will need to index and surface the NFTs efficiently while hiding spam. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be very difficult.\u201d\n\nWu sees compressed NFT tech as a means to expand the market\u2019s audience. \u201cWhat we need is to find a way to bring more users into the space to actually proliferate NFTs and the idea of digital assets so that your relatives, friends at Thanksgiving dinner, will actually be interested in NFTs.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of crypto is just speculation right now,\u201d and while that\u2019s \u201ckeeping the wheels turning,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s not something that is exciting in the long term.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun for now, but we need to grow beyond just speculation.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
