        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSolana (SOL) has surged past Binance Coin (BNB) to claim the position of the fourth-largest coin by market capitalization.\n\nAs per the latest market data, Solana's market capitalization now stands at $48.79 billion, edging out BNB's $41.40 billion.\n\nThis milestone comes amid a broader rally in the digital asset sector, with Solana's price reaching $114.54, marking a staggering 58.4% increase over the past week.\n\nOutperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nIn another significant development, Solana has been outperforming major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in trading volumes on Coinbase.\n\nNotably, it is the first time three coins have traded more than BTC in a 24-hour period on this platform.\n\nAdditionally, Solana has experienced a surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, surpassing all other chains with a 3,078% higher volume than Ethereum. This indicates growing investor confidence in Solana's ecosystem and its potential to sustain high transaction volumes, a key metric in the crypto world.\n\nSOL is still far from its ATH\n\nThe recent surge was ignited by the dog-themed meme coin, Bonk (BONK), which saw an astonishing jump in late November. This dramatic increase in value captured the attention of the crypto community and inspired the creation and trading of other similar meme coins.\n\nIt's not just about meme coins. Solana's total value locked is approaching $1.5 billion, which means that there is a healthy interest in the broader ecosystem.\n\nDespite this surge, SOL remains 56.21% below its all-time high, illustrating the volatile nature of the crypto market."

        "content": "The New York-based stablecoin issuer \u2013 Paxos \u2013 announced a strategic expansion of its stablecoin issuance to the Solana blockchain platform, which was previously exclusive to Ethereum. Paxos said it plans to make USDP available to the public on Solana starting January 17, 2024.\n\nThis move marks a significant milestone for Paxos in the competitive stablecoin landscape, where rivals such as Circle and Tether are also racing for market dominance.\n\nPaxos\u2019 Solana Expansion\n\nPaxos obtained approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) to expand USDP from Ethereum to Solana following a thorough examination. However, the company has not disclosed the duration of the review process.\n\nIn an official statement, Walter Hessert, Paxo\u2019s Head of Strategy, commented,\n\n\u201cThe expansion of our stablecoin platform to support Solana marks an important step towards making stablecoins ubiquitous for everyday consumers. Paxos has set the standard for oversight, reserve management, and issuance in the stablecoin market. By integrating USDP with Solana, we\u2019re making it easier for anyone to get and use the safest, most reliable stablecoins.\u201d\n\nPaxos became the first crypto firm to to secure a trust charter under the newly implemented digital asset regulatory framework by DFS in 2015. The company received DFS approval to issue its first stablecoin in 2018, dubbed \u2018Paxos Standard,\u2019 which was later rebranded to USDP three years later.\n\nBefore the latest Solana expansion, Paxos only issued USDP on Ethereum due to restrictions by the DFS. Over the years, the company has roped in major financial players.\n\nIn June, Paxos entered into a partnership with online marketplace Mercado Libre to introduce the Pax Dollar (USDP) stablecoin to users in Mexico. Transactions were set to be facilitated by MercadoPago, a digital wallet app developed by Mercado Libre.\n\nSubsequently, in August, the multinational fintech giant PayPal launched the US dollar-denominated stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), in association with Paxos.\n\nRegulatory Hurdles\n\nPaxos faced regulatory scrutiny when it was disclosed in February of this year that the DFS was conducting an investigation.\n\nAlthough the specific reason was not initially disclosed, it seemed to be linked to its involvement with BUSD, a stablecoin created in partnership with the crypto exchange Binance. Shortly afterward, the regulator directed Paxos to cease the issuance of the token.\n\nThis development dealt a significant blow to Paxos, given that more than 95% of its revenue was derived from this partnership.\n\nAmidst the regulatory turbulence, a relatively new crypto exchange, EDX Markets, terminated its collaboration with Paxos, which was supposed to serve as the former\u2019s crypto custodian."

        "title": "Solana's SOL Price Soars Thanks to Memecoin Hype and Institutional Backing - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Solana has seen its SOL token price surge by over 26% in the past week, making it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the top 10. The network\u2019s token had reached its all-time high back in November of 2022 before dropping to less than $10 in June 2023. Now, SOL is about to surpass the $100 mark.\n\nDespite only having been around for three years, Solana is widely considered to be one of the potential \u201cEthereum killers\u201d thanks to its high speeds and low frees. The recent spree mirrors that of the entirety of the crypto market and has been boosted by news of a new stablecoin joining the network, as well as the revival of meme coins and NFTs.\n\nNY Regulator Approval Allows First Solana Stablecoin\n\nAccording to Fortune, Paxos has been approved by New York\u2019s financial regulator to expand its services to Solana. The approval means that Ethereum would no longer be the only network capable of operating with USDP natively. With a market capitalization of over $370M, the news of USDP\u2019s expansion to Solana quickly contributed to its performance.\n\nA major difference between Paxos and other major stablecoins is the company\u2019s decision to collaborate with regulators, which prevented it from expanding as rapidly as its competitors. Up until this point, New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services had only authorized Paxos to operate in the Ethereum network.\n\nPaxos\u2019 decision to expand to Solana comes at a time when the firm is also collaborating with PayPal to issue a new stablecoin: PYUSD. According to Walter Hessert, Paxos\u2019 Head of Strategy, PayPal would also have an interest in cementing a presence in the Solana network, which could further increase the adoption of the protocol.\n\nMemecoin Mania Boosts Solana\n\nAnother key driver of Solana\u2019s price surge is the popularity of Bonk Inu ($BONK), a memecoin created as a direct response to FTX\u2019s downfall. Similarly to DogeCoin and Shiba Inu, BONK lacks any purpose beyond that of being transactable and a parody of other coins. This, however, hasn\u2019t stopped the coin from rising in value by more than 300% over the past month.\n\nWith a market capitalization of more than $1.1B and $304M in trading volume, the token\u2019s virality has further boosted Solana\u2019s growth. The token was also linked to Solana\u2019s Saga Smartphone, as an exclusive airdrop of 30 million BONK was made available to those who owned the phone.\n\nBinance\u2019s recent decision to launch a BONK futures offering has also contributed to the popularity of the memecoin. This comes less than two weeks after the listing of BONK in the world\u2019s biggest exchange, which has a 24-hour trading volume of over 120M USDT in the platform at the time of writing.\n\nNFT Volume Flows Back to Solana\n\nWith NFTs also making a comeback over the past months as major names launch new collections, Solana has also benefited from its share in the ecosystem. Tensor, Solana\u2019s most popular NFT marketplace at this time, has allowed Solana to attract an increasing number of collectors from other networks.\n\nWhile Tensor co-founder Ilja Moisejevs told Bloomberg that VCs would rather see the marketplace move to another network in its early days, opinions seem to have changed already. Tensos surpassed Magic Eden in trading volume earlier this month after rumors of airdrops became common among members of the NFT community. Today, Tensos accounts for 75% of all NFT trading volume in the Solana network according to its own data.\n\nSolana has also emerged as one of the top 5 gaming blockchains by transaction count, according to DappRadar and the Blockchain Gaming Alliance\u2019s Q3 Report. This is despite a quarter-to-quarter change of -42% that saw the network lose its dominance to Wax."

        "content": "Raydium, established on the Solana blockchain, functions as an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity provider, playing a crucial role in the Solana ecosystem\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Distinct from traditional exchanges, Raydium employs liquidity pools rather than an order book for asset trading, enabling swifter and more cost-effective transactions.\n\nThe platform\u2019s native token, RAY, serves multiple roles within the Raydium ecosystem, including governance, staking, and participation in liquidity pools. Token holders have the opportunity to stake their RAY tokens, engaging in the governance of the platform. This staking mechanism allows them to earn rewards and partake in decision-making processes about platform updates and changes.\n\nRaydium offers liquidity pools where users can deposit their tokens, facilitating trading on the platform. In return, liquidity providers earn a portion of the trading fees. The platform also supports yield farming, enabling users to gain additional rewards by providing liquidity.\n\nA significant feature of Raydium is its integration with Serum, a decentralized exchange (DEX) also built on Solana. This integration allows Raydium to contribute liquidity to Serum\u2019s order book, thereby enhancing the trading experience on both platforms. Operating on the Solana blockchain, Raydium benefits from the network\u2019s high throughput and low transaction costs, making it an appealing platform for DeFi activities, particularly for those seeking alternatives to Ethereum-based AMMs.\n\nRaydium\u2019s involvement in the Solana ecosystem is substantial, contributing to its liquidity and enabling a variety of DeFi applications and services. The RAY token has recently seen a dramatic increase of over 95%, reflecting significant growth in the network. At the time of writing, RAY is trading at $1.66, up 5.84% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $463 million. This positions RAY as the 134th most valuable crypto asset by market cap; the RAY token has risen up a highly impressive 1,097% since the start of 2023.\n\nIn the context of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes), \u201cTVL\u201d stands for Total Value Locked. TVL is a vital metric used to measure the aggregate value of all crypto assets deposited in a DeFi protocol, including DEXes. It serves as an indicator of a DeFi platform\u2019s overall health and strength and is used to gauge the level of user participation and trust in the platform. TVL is a crucial measure of the liquidity available on a DEX, with a higher TVL indicating more funds are available for trading, lending, and other DeFi activities, making the platform more efficient and attractive to users. It is also an indicator of popularity and trust, often correlating with the DEX\u2019s perceived stability.\n\nTVL is used as a comparison metric to evaluate different DeFi platforms, and changes in TVL can impact the native token prices of the DEX. While a high TVL indicates trust and liquidity, investors should also consider other factors like the platform\u2019s security, smart contract audit results, and overall market conditions, as a high TVL doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to low risk. TVL is calculated by adding the total value of all crypto assets deposited in the platform\u2019s contracts, often converted to a common currency like USD, for ease of comparison.\n\nRAY\u2019s recent gains have materialized as the Raydium protocol witnessed an explosion in TVL. At the time of writing, Raydium\u2019s TVL stands at $126.79 million, according to the decentralized finance tracker DeFi Llama. This represents an increase of more than 47.41% in the past week and 132% in the past month.\n\nThe Solana blockchain\u2019s TVL has also seen significant growth in the past month, registering $1.483 billion, an increase of 42.20% and 149% in the past week. SOL, the native token of Solana, is trading at $112.61 at the time of writing. Ranked 4th in market cap, SOL is up 17% in the past 24 hours.\n\nFeatured Image via Raydium"
