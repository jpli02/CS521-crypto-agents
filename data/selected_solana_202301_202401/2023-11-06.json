Unstaking and moving tokens to exchanges is the first step in liquidating assets, but the estate hasn't yet sold any."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token has seen a significant increase in value, rising over 70% in the last month to about $40, although it remains 85% below its all-time high of nearly $260 from November 2021.\n\nThe price spike comes amidst broader crypto market momentum, with SOL\u2019s previous peak coinciding with Bitcoin\u2019s surge above $69,000 two years prior.\n\nRecent developments for Solana include surpassing Polygon in daily DEX trading volume, reaching over $240 million, and attracting $74 million in institutional investment inflows, ranking it second only to Bitcoin.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token \u2013 SOL \u2013 has performed quite well in the past several weeks, with its price jumping by over 70% in the last 30 days. Currently, it trades at around $40 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), while last week, it even exceeded the $45 mark.\n\nThe rapid increase might sound impressive, but the token is still far from its all-time high registered exactly two years ago.\n\nBack then, SOL reached almost $260, meaning the asset is currently worth around 85% less than in November 2021.\n\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Solana\u2019s record price (as of the moment) coincided with an overall crypto bull market, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) exploding above $69,000.\n\nSOL\u2019s recent comeback has given investors fresh hopes that a rally toward further heights could be in the cards. As CryptoPotato reported last week, Solana\u2019s network has surpassed Polygon in daily decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume.\n\nThe former registered a volume of over $240 million, while the latter sat at approximately $137 million.\n\nIn addition, SOL has captured the interest of institutional investors. The asset has recorded $74 million in such inflows year-to-date, being second to Bitcoin."

        "content": "According to crypto analysis firm PeckShield, an FTX-labeled address has transferred 750,000 Solana (SOL) tokens to two addresses. As per PeckShield, the wallet sent $31 million worth of SOL to another wallet and $110 million to Binance. The move has caused some worry among investors as it may be the beginning of the defunct exchange\u2019s SOL liquidation.\n\nAlso Read: Solana: FTX Founder Used Alameda Profits to Buy SOL for $0.20\n\nThe transfer of tokens to an exchange is considered bearish as it increases the chances of them being sold. SOL\u2019s price has dipped 3.1% in the last 24 hours, and there are worries that it could fall further. However, the token is still up by 23.9% in the weekly charts.\n\nA U.S. court had approved FTX\u2019s request to liquidate its Solana (SOL) holdings earlier this year. Moreover, SOL makes up a majority of FTX\u2019s crypto holdings. According to the U.S. bankruptcy court, FTX held $1.16 billion worth of SOL.\n\nSource: United States Bankruptcy Court\n\nIs FTX liquidating its Solana holdings?\n\nSource: solana.com\n\nBecause the now-defunct exchange has received permission from the court, it is free to liquidate its SOL holdings to repay customers and shareholders. However, whether the market will be able to take the dumping is yet to be seen. Investors can anticipate a spike in sell pressure when FTX begins to sell its SOL holdings if they have not done so already.\n\nMoreover, Solana (SOL) had recently dropped 9% in the daily charts right after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s guilty verdict announcement. Investors had most probably anticipated that the fallen exchange would begin its liquidation process soon.\n\nAlso Read: Solana: SOL Drops Over 9% Amid FTX Founder\u2019s Guilty Verdict\n\nAlthough SOL is one of the best-performing crypto assets in 2023, there could be a massive correction in its price. However, the project has proven its resilience on several occasions and may quickly overcome its latest barrier.\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $40.33, up 0.8% in the last hour."

        "content": "Solana Price Prediction as SOL Surges Past $42 Zone \u2013 Can SOL Reach $100 in 2023?\n\nAs the digital currency market continues its dynamic ebb and flow, Solana (SOL) has recently captured the spotlight, surging past the pivotal $42 zone. This impressive momentum has sparked a flurry of speculation and analysis within the crypto community, leading many to ponder a tantalizing question: Could Solana\u2019s robust performance herald its ascent to the coveted $100 mark within 2023?\n\nIn this update, we delve into the factors driving Solana\u2019s surge, examining its technological underpinnings, market trends, and expert forecasts to present a comprehensive Solana price prediction for the year ahead\n\nSolana Price Prediction\n\nAs of today, Solana trades at $40.40, a modest retreat from the recent highs. This level reflects a pullback of 3.10% over the past 24 hours. Despite the slight downturn, Solana\u2019s robust market capitalization, currently at approximately $16.97 billion, maintains its stature as the seventh-largest digital asset.\n\nThe 4-hour chart unfolds an interesting narrative. The pivot point at $40.12 suggests a pivotal moment for the asset, with immediate resistance solidifying at $47.83. A breach of this level could clear the path towards the next resistance echelons at $54.40 and possibly $62.10.\n\nConversely, if the bears take control, we might see Solana testing the support at $33.55, with further declines potentially leading to $26.08 and $19.28.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 49, hovers around the midpoint, signaling a neutral sentiment that leaves room for movement in either direction. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $38.54, providing a cushion just below the current price level and offering a bullish signal as the price is perched above this moving average.\n\nAn upward channel is discernible, indicating sustained bullish sentiment over recent periods. Additionally, candlestick analysis reflects a potential cooling-off period following a significant uptrend, as evidenced by the consolidation pattern around the current price point.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith a general upward trend above the $38 mark, the bias remains bullish. In the short term, we could anticipate Solana testing higher resistance levels, contingent on market sentiment and volume support. Market participants may look towards the upper band of the channel for potential targets while staying vigilant for any shifts in momentum that might signal a trend reversal.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX): Last Chance Alert\n\nExplore the groundbreaking realm of Bitcoin Minetrix with its unique stake-to-mine model \u2013 as the presale impressively surpasses the $3.4 million mark.

        "title": "Bonk Inu: the light-hearted memecoin supporting Solana's growth - OKX",
        "content": "The Solana network has become a popular destination for a wide variety of projects that require a fast and permissionless layer-1 blockchain. Many have sought to innovate on top of Solana's existing infrastructure in various ways. The network's goal of supporting the emergence of decentralized scalable applications through faster transactions and lower fees saw Solana rise in popularity, along with its native token, SOL.\n\nAfter weathering volatility brought by the crypto downturn of 2022, developers built the Bonk Inu (BONK) memecoin on the Solana network as a catalyst to help bring fresh liquidity into the network. This guide will explore what Bonk Inu is, its token, and how it compares to other memecoins.\n\nWhat Is Bonk Inu (BONK)?\n\nBonk Inu (BONK) is a dog-themed memecoin designed to support the Solana community by boosting liquidity on the platform. The asset also aims to encourage the mutually beneficial involvement of all community members.\n\nOrigin\n\nTowards the end of 2022, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges at the time, FTX, collapsed. The development team behind Bonk Inu found that Solana was facing issues as an indirect result of the exchange's bankruptcy. In fact, the Solana platform was impacted by bad actors who were mainly interested in profiting from the platform.\n\nAs a means of addressing the negative impact of the market downturn that arrived in 2022, Bonk Inu was created and launched on Solana in December 2022. The asset's arrival began with an airdrop of half its token supply.\n\nMany of the tokens found their way into the cryptocurrency wallets of some of the largest creators of non-fungible tokens (NFT). The coin was also airdropped to investors, as well as other influential people in the Solana community who could drive its growth. Although the airdrop had an immediate positive impact on the value of SOL, BONK was designed to have a long-term impact on the entire blockchain.\n\nBONK as a project aimed to restore the Solana community and strengthen its influence by attracting usage from the masses, rather than being controlled by the few.\n\nThe BONK airdrop went to the social layer of the network. This included DeFi traders, NFT enthusiasts, and developers. BONK also aimed to encourage those that are not involved in Web3 to join and explore the next iteration of the web. Towards this goal, Bonk Inu has wider plans to support the future of Solana with BonkDAO \u2014 a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that acts as a governing party led by the community.\n\nSome BONK tokens were also left aside for the future development of the blockchain with the aim of promoting activities and other initiatives.\n\nBONK team and funding\n\nThe Bonk Inu (BONK) cryptocurrency was created by Dexlab, but its founders are anonymous. Dexlab is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a minting lab that provides a launchpad for new projects. The project's initial funding was supported by the Web3 payments API, Helio.\n\nAdditionally, Famous Fox Federation played a key role in the launch with its work on the airdrop and raffles. Today, the total token supply of BONK stands at 100 trillion.\n\nHow does Bonk Inu work?\n\nBonk Inu is a Solana cryptocurrency that falls in the memecoin category. The asset is often compared to Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) due to its meme theme.\n\nBonk Inu has one primary objective: to restore and take control of the Solana blockchain community by drawing more users toward the Solana ecosystem. By establishing the token as the primary Solana asset, the developers behind BONK intend for it to be used across all decentralized applications (DApps) built on the Solana ecosystem. To help achieve this, BONK was distributed for free to those who best serve the network.\n\nAlongside rewarding existing Solana community members, BONK aims to welcome new users from the wider crypto community by providing an intuitive starting point for retail users. Above all, BONK's goal is to fully realize the potential of the Solana blockchain.\n\nBONK token\n\nBonk Inu (BONK), as a token, is described as the first Solana dog cryptocurrency for the people.It aims to provide superior distribution mechanics to its predecessors by distributing coins to community members. These members are the ones that are most likely to use Bonk's true utility.In short, BONK was created and is used to establish a better ecosystem on Solana. It aims to incentivize developers and new users to join the ecosystem. It also aims to have a high market cap.\n\nTokenomics\n\nThe official launch of the BONK cryptocurrency gained a lot of attention. This is due to the fact that half of its token supply was airdropped. Its total supply is at 100 trillion, or 100,000,000,000,000 BONK tokens.At the time of writing, the token's circulating supply is at 54.18 trillion BONK, with a market cap of 42.23 million.\n\nBONK token uses\n\nBONK has numerous use cases. It aims to incentivize development on top of Solana and introduce new people to the Solana network. What's more, anyone unfamiliar with Web3 technology may be more incentivized to use it through BONK. Above all else, BONK is driven by the core intention of building back the Solana ecosystem following its decline.\n\nDistribution\n\nBonk believes in giving back to the community. At the time of writing, the project's distribution model is as follows:\n\n21% SOL NFT projects\n\n15.8% market participants and DeFi users\n\n10.5% artist and collectors\n\n5.3% Solana devs\n\n2% early contributors\n\n15.8% BONK DAO\n\n5.3% initial liquidity\n\n5.3% marketing\n\nBONK Wallet\n\nThe BONK Wallet is an official cryptocurrency wallet developed for the BONK token. During the project's unique airdrops, users could receive BONK just by installing the wallet on their devices.\n\nThe BONK wallet is a social wallet that features profiles, a chat function, and the ability to tip. It's a self-custodian wallet where only the user has access to BONK. The Bonk Inu wallet also calculates the lowest fees for transactions. Meanwhile, gifts and airdrops are given to reward the Bonk community.\n\nBonk Inu NFTs\n\nBonk Inu NFTs, known as BONKz, was released on the Solana marketplace known as Magic Eden. They were designed to help further BONK's overall usage on the Solana network. The NFTs are art-based with no plans for initial utility.\n\nBonkBot\n\nBONKbot is a Solana-based trading bot for Telegram, designed for quick and effortless trading while you're on the go. Input a token address into Telegram using BONKbot and you can immediately start a purchase. Say goodbye to delays in wallet connections, slippage adjustments, or transaction confirmations.\n\nBONKbot is equipped with Jupiter-driven routing, granting you a fast way to handle, oversee, and carry out your trades, so you can stay in charge.\n\nBONK vs. DOGE vs. SHIB\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are two cryptocurrencies that saw a huge rise in popularity since launching. Their fame among memecoins was driven by the light heartedness of the coins and their growth potential.\n\nBoth cryptocurrencies experienced huge spikes in value once they gained traction among traders. Due to their affordability, they're far more liquid and see high daily usage when compared to expensive tokens.DOGE launched in December 2013 and is a peer-to-peer (P2P) currency based on the Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW) consensus mechanism. SHIB, meanwhile, is an experiment in decentralized community building. It established its own ecosystem with ShibaSwap and other projects.\n\nBONK is a memecoin just like DOGE and SHIB, and has seen a similarly sharp increase in value. What's more, Bonk has had a positive impact on the SOL price.However, BONK has a primary purpose of supporting the Solana community. It aims to make sure that the ecosystem is under constant development, unlike DOGE and SHIB.\n\nThe final word\n\nBONK is truly a project that provides solid changes to the Solana (SOL) ecosystem. After SOL saw a decline following volatility in the crypto market, the introduction of BONK has helped to put the Solana network back on a more stable footing while bringing new users into the community. New developers, NFT collectors, and users are now optimistic about the future of Solana and its mission of supporting the emergence of decentralized scalable applications."
