        "content": "Solana Beach City Council members approved an accessory dwelling unit ordinance on Nov. 29 with a provision that deed-restricts them as lower income housing for 25 years.\n\nThe council had previously considered a deed restriction of up to 99 years, but felt it would disincentivize homeowners from building them.\n\n\u201cI think we might see more residents being willing to deed restrict their ADU if it were for basically a generation, instead of an entire lifetime,\u201d Solana Beach Mayor Lesa Heebner said during the meeting.\n\nWith the state government turning to ADUs to help alleviate the housing crisis, cities have been modifying their local ADU laws to try to maximize the benefits and implement design standards \u2013 although many aspects of the state laws override the local control that cities have on ADU policy.\n\nThe Solana Beach ordinance includes update definitions for accessory dwelling units and junior accessory dwelling units, modifications to height limits that are consistent with state law, and other clarifications in the Solana Beach municipal code. The ordinance also eliminates a ban on ADUs on properties within environmentally-sensitive habitat areas, the Hillside Overlay Zone, and the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, according to the city staff report.\n\nCities such as Solana Beach and Del Mar have also been talking about how to best use new ADUs to meet their state-mandated housing goals. Through the sixth cycle Regional Housing Needs Allocation, the city of Solana Beach has to provide zoning for 875 new housing units across all income levels.\n\nAccording to a city staff report, 31 ADUs have been built in Solana Beach from 2020 to 2022. None have been constructed in 2023, but three permits were issued and another 22 are under review. The report also says that the city is on pace to permit 70% more ADUs than expected for the city\u2019s housing element."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTraders and analysts are discussing the roots of the \"New Solana Summer\" as all core metrics of on-chain activity are rocketing. Some of them have already reached pre-FTX collapse levels. NFTs and meme coin segments might be contributing to this upsurge, data says.\n\nSolana (SOL) exceeds Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP) by transactional volume\n\nIn early December 2023, the aggregated on-chain trading volume on the Solana (SOL) blockchain surged above $240 million per day in equivalent. As such, the blockchain managed to surpass both Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP), two mainstream Ethereum-based L2s by this indicator.\n\nImage by DefiLlama\n\nIn the first days of December, Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) demonstrate trading volumes of $137 million and $40 million per day, respectively. As such, Solana (SOL) processes more money on-chain than they do combined.\n\nAlso, in the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) exceeded its another rival Avalanche (AVAX) by net value locked in dApps. Solana's dApp ecosystem is responsible for $688 million in TVL, Avalanche (AVAX) dApps logged $660 million. At that pace, Solana (SOL) might surpass the TVLs of Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) in the coming days.\n\nIn the last month, Solana's (SOL) TVL added over 60%, while the SOL price soared by 45%.\n\nHowever, it is still lagging behind Arbitrum (ARB), a dominant Ethereum (ETH) L2. Arbitrum (ARB) amassed almost $2.2 billion in TVL, while its daily trading volume exceeds $363 million in equivalent.\n\nSolScriptions and meme coins triggered Solana (SOL) comeback\n\nThe rally of Solana (SOL) and its network indicators can be attributed to a combination of powerful catalysts. For instance, the interest in Solana-based Ordinals \"SolScriptions\" and meme coins triggered the growth of SPL tokens minted on-chain.\n\nThen, Solana-based liquid staking protocols like Jito and Marinade Finance are actively attracting new customers and liquidity. Decentralized exchanges like Raydium and Orca are also gaining traction.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, CoinEx Research indicated the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector as yet another powerful catalyst for Solana (SOL) ecosystem's rebound."

        "content": "Some projects developed under Solana are planning to reward users.\n\nDemand for SOL may lead the price back to $65.\n\nAccording to Messari, Solana\u2019s [SOL] airdrop season is here, and, the impact on the network could be different from what has been happening in the last few months. Crypto airdrops are popular in the ecosystem.\n\nNew projects see it as a model of retaining users by rewarding some participants who meet certain requirements with tokens. In recent times Solana-based Pyth Network [PYTH] did the same for its early adopters when it launched on mainnet.\n\nMessari, in its report, noted that there are upcoming airdrops. Some of these include Jupiter, Zeta, and Drift among others.\n\nIt's airdrop season for @solana DeFi. With only one official airdrop to date, and more coming along the way from Jupiter, Marginfi, Drift, Zeta, and JitoSol, we can expect an increase in liquidity and user engagement. pic.twitter.com/BZn3WiUT4j \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) November 30, 2023\n\nMore rewards, more liquidity for Solana\n\nThe crypto market intelligence noted that the forthcoming events could bring more liquidity for Solana. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the Solana ecosystem showed that there has been a surge in its DEX volume.\n\nFor instance, DefiLlama showed that the Total Value Locked (TVL) in Drift had a 30-day 88.69% increase. Jito\u2019s TVL was $401.80 million, indicating a 96.89% increase within the same period.\n\nThe TVL measures the number of tokens locked in a protocol. If the metric increases, it means market participants perceive the protocol to be trustworthy.\n\nAlso, the TVL increase infers an increase in deposits with players expecting a yield from the locked assets.\n\nAssuming the TVL decreased, it would have implied a decrease in assets locked. Messari also considered the number of active users on Jupiter. According to the data, new addresses have been increasing on the network.\n\nThe increase in new addresses is a sign of traction. Compared with projects like Radium and Orca, Jupiter had a large dominance. This could be because users are expecting an airdrop from Jupiter.\n\nMeanwhile, Orca and Radium did not reveal any plan to reward their users.\n\nBesides a potential rise in active users, the airdrops could also impact the SOL price action. This is because the rise in activity could lead to increased demand for SOL.\n\nSOL\u2019s rise is again, nearby\n\nAt press time, SOL\u2019s value was $60.81. Furthermore, the SOL/USD 4-hour chart showed that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) had reached 64.42.\n\nOn 27th November, the RSI reading was down 31.98, indicating that SOL had undergone a lot of selling pressure.\n\nTherefore, the rise in the RSI reading implies that buying momentum has returned. Should the buy orders continue coming in, then SOL may hit $65. But this would only happen as long as sellers do not take control of the market.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nAnother indicator backing the bullish thesis is the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). At the time of writing, the 9-day EMA (blue) had crossed over the 20 EMA (yellow).\n\nThis indicates that SOL might increase from $60 in the short term."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s creation was designed to work with all the functionalities of Ethereum and improve upon the issues that arose in the network\u2019s early days. The blockchain has since grown in popularity in the past few years, with many crypto participants touting Solana as the one to dethrone Ethereum in the altcoin market. However, it seems Solana\u2019s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko is tired of the comparison, and just wants a situation where the network can thrive.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko\u2019s Thoughts On The \u2018Ethereum Killer\u2019 Label\n\nSolana has done well since the October bottom which led to market gains in the wider crypto market. The crypto\u2019s price has done 197% gains since the middle of October and is up by 531% from its 2023 open of around $9.96. At the same time, Solana\u2019s TVL in DeFi has also grown spectacularly, adding 74.67% in the past month and $482 million since the beginning of 2023.\n\nFurthermore, according to the data provided by DeFiLlama, the daily trade volume of Solana\u2019s DeFi has been surpassing that of Ethereum L2 Chains like as Polygon and Optimism. All these on-chain metrics, coupled with the recent proposal by MakerDAO\u2019s co-founder Rune Christensen to utilize a fork of Solana\u2019s codebase for the creation of MakerDAO\u2019s upcoming native chain called \u201cNewChain\u201d appears to have sparked another round of assertions that Solana is a potential Ethereum killer.\n\nSOL market cap currently at $26.64 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nYakovenko recently took to social media platform X to speak on the recent Ethereum killer making rounds again. According to him, both networks can co-exist even while competing and having most of the same features.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs,\u201d Yakovenko said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies,\u201d he continued.\n\nDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs. It\u2019s lame. Pareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies. I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nThe Future Of Ethereum And Solana\n\nSolana was initially created to address Ethereum\u2019s scaling solution, as the network could only process 15 transactions per second in its early days. Solana\u2019s solution then came with a combination of proof-of-history and delegated proof-of-stake protocols to process more than 50,000 transactions per second. Other networks like Cardano that serve the same use-case were also touted as potential Ethereum killers.\n\nHowever, this scalability issue has since been addressed on Ethereum and the network can now process up to 100,000 transactions per second. Layer-2 protocols have also been built, and Ethereum continues to retain its title as the king of altcoins.\n\nEthereum developers are also looking to increase transactional throughput by introducing a rollup scaling method called danksharding. Yakovenko also believes danksharding will eventually have enough bandwidth to accommodate all of Solana\u2019s data.\n\nSolana is currently trading at $63.43 and is on its way to the $70 price point. The first step would be to break above the yearly high of $65.5.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock"

I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nThe outburst comes after Rune Christensen, MakerDAO co-founder and CEO revealed plans to remove the protocol\u2019s NewChain from Ethereum and fork it on the Solana blockchain. While his intentions may have been harmless, the community received it as a battle of the best between Solana and Ethereum. To Yakovenko, however, this battle can only be detrimental to the ecosystem.\n\nDiscrediting the perception that \u201cSolana thrives and somehow Ethereum dies,\u201d Yakovenko demonstrates optimism in Danksharding being able to have adequate bandwidth to contain the entire expanse of Solana data.\n\nNotably, Danksharding is a technology that enables blockchain technology to add cheaper blocks. It is an Ethereum rollup scaling method that expands transactional throughput by increasing storage space for roll-up transactions.\n\nNot the first time\n\nThis is not the first time Yakovenko is attempting to quell the Solana versus Ethereum feud. In an October citing, jebus.eth, an Ethereum community member took shots at Solana, likening it to the Democrat Party of crypto. He called it a \u201cCoalition of poors and wealthy people,\u201d who lack an understanding of value and its source, adding that it was a group of people who prioritized cheap over value.\n\nSol is like the dem party of crypto\n\n\n\nCoallition of poors and wealthy ppl who don't understand where value actually comes from or how to create it, just that the things I want should be cheap \u2014 Jebus.eth (@jebus911) October 1, 2023\n\nIn response, Yakovenko defended, \u201cIn the grand theatre of economic transformation, Ethereum presents itself not as a harbinger of genuine revolution, but merely as a novel spectacle of bourgeois upheaval.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Solana price remains committed to the north, boasting a 2% surge on the day, accompanied by an 11% climb in trading volume. The parity between price and trading volume points to strong interest in the asset by buyers. It also points to higher liquidity, better order execution, and a more active market for connecting a buyer and seller.\n\nAt the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading for $63.58, with eyes peeled on the $70.00 mark amid rising momentum and the presence of bulls in the SOL market. This is indicated by the northbound RSI and the green histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) in the positive territory."
