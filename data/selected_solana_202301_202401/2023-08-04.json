        "content": "Whether it's her music, her style, or her curves, SZA's online presence is always turning heads and getting rabid fans in the comments. Moreover, she recently took to Instagram with a new photo dump that had fans going wild in their replies. As one fan rightfully pointed out, \"Posting mad random s**t looking mad good smh,\" as she typically does with her potential thirst trap content. In the first image, the 33-year-old basks in the sun in a cream and brown-colored bikini, showing off her abs and body to many's delight. Most people were blown away by her physique and charmed instantly by her fun collection of snaps, with Benny Blanco commenting, \"it\u2019s always summer when u r solana.\"\n\nFurthermore, the TDE signer also included a hoodied-up pic in the studio with sweatpants and a cap on, hopefully hinting at something dropping soon. In addition, she does the splits in front of an art piece, poses with Homer and Lisa Simpson statues, and gets in front of a strange and futuristic mirror that looks like the chrome future from that one SpongeBob episode. Finally, there's an intense game of Jenga captured in real time with engineer Hector Castro. SZA better stop playing games and follow up SOS with even more phenomenal music.\n\nRead More: SZA Doubles Up With Stunning Photo Dumps\n\nSZA Stuns In Latest IG Photo Dump\n\nOf course, the \"Gone Girl\" vocalist is prone to dropping content like this on a pretty regular basis. Still, it doesn't make SZA's snapshots any less cute, gorgeous, or fun; it feels like you're just watching your friend post as normal. Regardless, she has been spending a lot of time in the studio lately, whether just for fun or actively working on a release. Whatever the case, she can do whatever she wants after the last album's success. In any case, Solana has us engaged no matter what with content like this.\n\nMeanwhile, her recent feature alongside Future on Travis Scott's \"TELEKINESIS\" might mean that there's even more to come. Maybe all that studio time has been working on a new record to come out around this time. Even if it doesn't, she might as well be charging people to fawn all over her online at this point. On that note, come back to HNHH for the latest news and updates on SZA.\n\nRead More: SZA Responds To Being Included In Barack Obama\u2019s Summer Playlist, Calls Him Her \u201cForever President\u201d"

        "content": "Solana co-founder Raj Gokal is not very worried about a recent move by Robinhood and other U.S.-based platforms to delist SOL as a tradable asset amid regulatory uncertainty. In a CNBC interview, Gokal labeled Robinhood and other exchanges that took the same step as crypto \u201ctourists.\u201d He also weighed in on ongoing efforts to bring clarity to the U.S. crypto industry.\n\nRecall that Robinhood, with an estimated 23 million users, delisted SOL in June. The crypto asset was tagged alongside others as securities by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. Although the Solana co-founder hesitated to comment on the ongoing court case, he reckoned that the Robinhood delisting was not a significant concern for the Solana Foundation.\n\nThe Solana co-founder said, \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty understandable for U.S. businesses that are not primarily crypto businesses [to delist SOL]. We see this in every market cycle: crypto tourists and businesses that have very small product lines in crypto and kind of recede when it gets hot in the kitchen. My understanding of folks like Robinhood and other products is that these were really small product lines.\u201d Focusing on the positives since the SEC saga with crypto exchanges, Raj Gokal added, \u201cThe more important thing is that folks like Coinbase, Binance, and other exchanges that represent the largest majority of trading volume and activity for users are not taking any meaningful action that limits consumer access to these assets. That\u2019s great to see and what I expect to continue to see.\u201d\n\nWe Want Clarity: Raj Gokal\n\nSolana\u2019s co-founder also expressed optimism that the U.S. crypto industry is on the verge of getting regulatory clarity. According to Gokal, there are a lot of \u201cpositive signs\u201d and \u201cmore legislative pressure to create more clear and actionable guidelines for how to operate in crypto.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe just want clarity. I think the lack of regulatory clarity has held the industry back for several years, and it seems we\u2019re on the verge of getting that, hopefully from Congress.\u201d\n\nRaj Gokal praised U.S. Congressmen Patrick McHenry, Ritchie Torres, and others who are promoting the need for clear regulations before lawmakers. He also singled out Coinbase for praise, lauding the exchange\u2019s ongoing effort to provide clear guidelines to the emerging industry."

        "content": "Mastering the Art of NFT Annihilation: Unraveling the Mystery of How to Burn an NFT\n\n\u200dThe non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace has become a bustling hub of digital art, innovation, and investment.\n\nBut what happens when you want to obliterate an NFT from existence? Enter the intriguing world of NFT burning.\n\nAlso read: Dogecoin Army Buzzing with Anticipation After Elon Musk\u2019s Tweet\n\nThis comprehensive guide will walk you through How to Burn a non-fungible token, including its purpose, steps on various blockchains, and implications for your digital asset\u2019s future.\n\nSource: Information Age\n\nThe Art of NFT Destruction: Can NFTs Be Obliterated?\n\nNon-fungible tokens, once minted on the blockchain, become immutable digital assets.\n\nHowever, you can destroy or \u201cburn\u201d them through a process similar to sending the token into a digital black hole.\n\nThis act, known as \u201cburning,\u201d sends the token to an inaccessible, unspendable address, effectively wiping it from existence.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu: $1000 Investment on ShibaSwap Debut, Profit Revealed\n\nBurning an NFT: What Does It Entail?\n\nThe act of burning a non-fungible token is synonymous with completely deleting it. It involves the transfer of a token to an address that remains inaccessible to all.\n\nOnce a non-fungible token is burned, it is impossible to retrieve it. Hence, it is crucial to be sure that burning is your desired course of action.\n\nInterestingly, as the digital asset dissolves, its history and record remain imprinted on the blockchain, providing evidence of its existence and subsequent annihilation.\n\nThe Void Address: Understanding the Token Burn Address\n\nSource: Cointurk\n\nAn NFT burn address is a specialized wallet address that acts as a digital incinerator for tokens. Also known as an \u201caddress eater,\u201d this null address is inaccessible and holds no keys.\n\nIt is the ultimate lock without a key.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, the burn address is often represented as 0x0000000000000000000000000000dEaD.\n\nPolygon\u2019s burn address appears as 0x0000000000000000000000000000, while Solana employs the burn address \u2018 remove.sol.\u2019\n\nDispatching an NFT to these addresses permanently eliminates it from circulation.\n\nThe Price of NFT Annihilation: Does Burning an NFT Cost Anything?\n\nYes, the process of burning an NFT incurs a cost.\n\nThis transaction fee, colloquially referred to as a \u201cgas fee,\u201d is required to process the burning of your non-fungible token.\n\nThe fee can fluctuate based on the current supply and demand on the blockchain.\n\nThe cost of burning an NFT can range anywhere from $0.00025 to $100.\n\nThe Step-by-Step Guide: How to Burn an NFT\n\nThe burning process is straightforward. Below is a step-by-step guide to burning your NFT on popular blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.\n\nIncinerating an Ethereum NFT\n\nHere\u2019s your guide on How to Burn an NFT on Ethereum:\n\nAccess the wallet or marketplace holding your NFT. Choose the NFT you wish to burn and hit the \u201cTransfer\u201d button. Direct your NFT to Ethereum\u2019s official burn address, which is 0x00000000000000000000000000000000dEaD. Settle the required gas fees to transfer your NFT and click \u201cConfirm.\u201d\n\nWith these steps, your NFT will be permanently dissolved and removed from the marketplace. Remember, gas fees can vary based on supply and demand on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBurning a Polygon NFT\n\nThe process of burning an NFT on the Polygon blockchain mirrors that of Ethereum, except for the burn address.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\nNavigate to the item page for the NFT you wish to burn. Click on the transfer button. Enter the Polygon burn address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000. Hit \u201cTransfer,\u201d confirm the transaction with your wallet, pay the gas fees, and you\u2019re done!\n\nObliterating a Solana NFT\n\nBurning an NFT on Solana differs slightly from other NFT blockchains.\n\nThe Phantom Wallet, a popular Solana wallet, has built-in burning features that reward users with SOL for burning certain NFTs.\n\nFor NFTs that aren\u2019t supported by the built-in burning features, use the following steps:\n\nOpen your Solana wallet and locate the NFT you wish to burn. Add the \u2018 remove.sol \u2018 wallet address in the recipient field. Confirm the transaction and pay the associated gas fees.\n\nThe \u2018remove.sol\u2019 address is a graveyard for unwanted NFTs.\n\nOnce you send your NFT there, there\u2019s no turning back; the burning process becomes irreversible.\n\nMonetary Compensation for Burning an NFT: Is It Possible?\n\nMonetary compensation for burning an NFT is platform-dependent.\n\nWhile Ethereum and Polygon offer no return, platforms like the Phantom Wallet provide a unique mechanism that rewards users with SOL for burning certain NFTs.\n\nHence, it\u2019s advisable to check the specifics of the platform used to determine if it offers a reward.\n\nReasons to Burn an NFT: Why Would You Do It?\n\nThe act of burning an NFT serves several purposes.\n\nIt can be a strategic tool to control the value of an asset. Since NFTs appreciate when demand surpasses supply, reducing the supply via burning can potentially increase the price of the remaining tokens.\n\nBurning can also expunge flawed or redundant tokens from circulation, which is particularly useful when an excess number of tokens devalues individual tokens.\n\nMoreover, burning NFTs can help build trust and credibility, especially during the early phases of a token\u2019s lifecycle.\n\nCreators often burn unsold tokens post-launch to demonstrate accountability and safeguard the interests of token buyers, enhancing their credibility.\n\nCertain token collections also incentivize holders to burn their tokens. For instance, Gary Vaynerchuk recently launched Burn Island, a burn-to-redeem program that rewards VeeFriends holders for burning their tokens.\n\nSecurity Measures: Can Someone Else Burn My NFT?\n\nNo one can burn your non-fungible token without your consent.\n\nUnless they have access to your wallet keys, your NFT is safe.\n\nHowever, some smart contracts might incorporate a \u201cburn mechanism,\u201d enabling you to destroy your token.\n\nThis implies that you can design a smart contract to permit burning your non-fungible token or even allow others to do so.\n\nThe Permanence of Burning: Can a Burned, Non-Fungible Token Be Recovered?\n\nThe burning is a permanent process.\n\nOnce you dispatch a unit to an unspendable address, it becomes irretrievable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s possible to mint a new one with similar properties and attributes, although it won\u2019t be identical to the original one.\n\nThe Aftermath: What Happens to Tokens?\n\nBurning a token doesn\u2019t physically destroy the token. Instead, it sends the NFT to a null address, rendering the token unattainable.\n\nOnce you send your token to a null address, it\u2019s lost to the ether because private keys don\u2019t exist for it.\n\nConclusion\n\nBurning a token might seem counterintuitive at first. However, it\u2019s a strategic tool for managing the value of your tokens and your non-fungible token community.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a creator seeking accountability or a non-fungible token buyer looking to capitalize on increasing values, understanding How to Burn a token can be a game-changer.\n\nOur comprehensive guide equips you to navigate the NFT inferno with confidence.\n\nSo torch those tokens, and let\u2019s see what happens!"
