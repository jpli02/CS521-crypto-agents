May mga barangay sa bayan natin ang na-isolate, kagaya ng Barangay Dasun, Bauan at Malalam-Malacabibi. Kahit noong ginagawa pa lang itong evacuation center, malaking tulong na ang naibigay nito sa amin,\u201d she shared.\n\nIn the town of Pe\u00f1ablanca, PAGCOR\u2019s evacuation facility was built in the remote barangay of Minanga, which is almost two hours away from the town center and has no access to telecommunication. The community\u2019s mountainous location and partly unpaved roads, make it challenging for the local government to deliver swift aid to locals whenever they are affected by natural disasters.\n\n\u201cNitong mga nakaraang taon, nasubok tayo ng iba\u2019t ibang kalamidad tulad na lamang ng malawakang pagbaha dito sa probinsiya ng Cagayan noong 2020. Nasundan ito ng isa pang malawakang pagbaha noong 2021 at noong 2022, naramdaman natin ang lakas ng yanig ng lindol na tumama sa Ilocos region,\u201d Pe\u00f1ablanca Mayor Washington Taguinod shared.\n\n\u201cNaging priority natin ang pagtayo nitong PAGCOR evacuation center sa Barangay Minanga dahil sa layo nito sa poblaci\u00f3n. This is a non-telco area, which means mahirap para sa mga residente na humingi ng agarang tulong kapag may kalamidad,\u201d Taguinod added.\n\nWith the completion of the PAGCOR-funded evacuation center in the far-flung Barangay Minanga, Taguinod said that the locals \u2013 including the indigenous peoples living at the foot of Sierra Madre \u2013 will be assured of a safe shelter as well as a venue where the local government can download relief goods and other basic government services in times of disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, Amulong Municipal Mayor Elpidio Rendon also expressed his gratitude to PAGCOR for giving the vulnerable sectors of their community a secure evacuation shelter during calamities. \u201cIn Amulong, we have identified typhoons, landslides, drought and flood as major hazards. The flood alone affects 17 of the 47 barangays. This situation pushes us to raise the adaptive capabilities of our communities that are exposed to flooding. This evacuation center will be of great help to the vulnerable members of our community \u2013 such as the elderly, children and pregnant women \u2013 especially during the onslaught of natural disasters,\u201d he said.\n\nPAGCOR\u2019s Vice President for Corporate Social Responsibility Group Ramon Stephen Villaflor, who graced the inauguration of the evacuation facilities in Cagayan explained that instead of constructing a two-storey building, the state-run gaming firm provided funding for four basketball-court type multi-purpose facilities in towns that are most vulnerable to flooding.\n\nBesides Amulong, Solana and Pe\u00f1ablanca, the town of Iguig also received a basketball-court type evacuation facility. Final inspection of the project in Iguig was already conducted.\n\nMeanwhile, apart from the province of Cagayan, PAGCOR also recently inaugurated two-storey multi-purpose evacuation centers worth P50 million each in the towns of Floridablanca and Candaba in Pampanga. Over 200,000 residents from said municipalities stand to benefit from the modern and spacious buildings.\n\nTo date, a total of 24 MPECs have been completely built and inaugurated nationwide while 53 are still undergoing construction."
