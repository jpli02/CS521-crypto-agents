        "content": "La Jollan Christiana Updegraff\u2019s artworks are on exhibit in Solana Beach through Friday, May 5.\n\nFinding freedom in highlighting the nature of gender expectations, La Jolla artist Christiana Updegraff is showcasing a collection of three-dimensional works at an exhibit in Solana Beach.\n\nThe show, called \u201cTether,\u201d also features works by Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos artist Alexandra Carter. It opened April 8 at Oolong Gallery and continues through Friday, May 5.\n\nNewsletter Get the La Jolla Light weekly in your inbox News, features and sports about La Jolla, every Thursday for free Enter email address Sign Me Up You may occasionally receive promotional content from the La Jolla Light.\n\nThe exhibit focuses on the ways in which the artists \u2014 both of them mothers \u2014 feel bound to their children, partners and others\u2019 expectations.\n\nTo flesh out the theme, Updegraff employs many materials in her projects, using industrial supplies such as cement or wood and \u201ca lot of domestic objects that are deconstructed [and] items that have a certain gender affiliation or expectation,\u201d she said.\n\nChristiana Updegraff\u2019s \u201cDangle, Tangle, Drop\u201d is one of the works in the exhibit \u201cTether.\u201d (Christiana Updegraff)\n\nUpdegraff\u2019s works include string, textiles and fabrics designed to bring focus to the body and elicit \u201ca visceral response in the viewer,\u201d she said.\n\nHer creations in the exhibit explore the isolation and unmooring Updegraff felt after she and her husband, video editor and La Jolla native Tucker Bass, moved to La Jolla from Los Angeles in August 2020 with their newborn and 2-year-old.\n\nThe family moved to be closer to Bass\u2019 parents, and while that has been a boon, the restrictions early in the COVID-19 pandemic meant isolation for Updegraff.\n\nBut she was able to create in her art studio in the garage in close proximity to her children, all the while probing the concepts of loss and caretaking.\n\n\u201cThe minutiae of caretaking is ever-present in my work,\u201d Updegraff said, \u201cparticularly during this time of staying at home and having to provide for these two little people and their needs all day and then not being able to leave and come back. \u2026 It\u2019s literally like dishes and cleaning and giving of myself to these other two people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a loss of community for parents in general,\u201d she said, but the pandemic quarantines compounded her feelings. \u201cThe loss of myself ... was really difficult for me because there was no other community. There was nothing to turn to.\u201d\n\nUpdegraff, who earned a master\u2019s degree in fine arts from San Diego State University in 2011 and creates art while teaching full time at Long Beach City College and SDSU, also explores \u201cgender constructs and how society places expectations on men or women \u2026 and how those differences shape our experience in the world.\u201d\n\nChristiana Updegraff\u2019s \u201c1005\u201d is another of her creations on view at Oolong Gallery in Solana Beach through May 5. (Christiana Updegraff)\n\nAs a mother, Updegraff said she sometimes feels pulled to conform to expectations of gender that compel her to be a caretaker while also pursuing her career.\n\nUpdegraff was raised in Kentucky and says she was confronted by Southern society\u2019s differing expectations for her and her brother.\n\n\u201cI felt that very acutely growing up, so I\u2019ve really tried my hardest to dispel those notions of gender constructs and fight against those,\u201d she said.\n\nUpdegraff also references fertility in her works, as well as \u201chow people present themselves to the exterior world,\u201d she said.\n\nThe idea that one must maintain \u201can air of perfection \u2026 is particularly pervasive in today\u2019s culture when dealing with women,\u201d Updegraff said. \u201cYou can [try to] check all the boxes that you\u2019re supposed to check. I think we all bravely try to fulfill [that], but it\u2019s unattainable.\u201d\n\nThat notion is exemplified in many of the works in \u201cTether,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amplifying that not everything has to be OK,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of us are coming unglued and pushing against the idea of being perfect.\u201d\n\nOolong Gallery is at 349 N. Hwy. 101, Solana Beach. For more information, visit oolongallery.com. \u25c6"
