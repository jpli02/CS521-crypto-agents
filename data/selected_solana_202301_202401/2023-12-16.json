More Ambitious Predictions: Some experts are exceptionally bullish, with predictions like Crypto King forecasting SOL could hit $300, and Canfield suggesting a potential rise to $1,000. Canfield also recommends diversifying investments between Ethereum and Solana.\n\nSome of the Bullish SOL Forecasts\n\nSolana\u2019s native cryptocurrency has undoubtedly been among the digital assets that captured much of the investors\u2019 interest this year.\n\nThis was mainly due to SOL\u2019s spectacular price rise from approximately $10 at the start of 2023 to its current level of around $78 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data). Despite the 650% surge, some analysts believe the token\u2019s uptrend is nowhere near its end.\n\nOne example is the popular X (Twitter) user Ali, who claimed that a sustained close above $68.2 could cause a price rally toward $90.\n\nThe crypto analyst using the X handle Deftsuo also envisioned additional gains in the near future. Surpassing the $100 mark was presented as a doable target.\n\nThe Outrageous SOL Bets\n\nOther experts have been even more optimistic, suggesting that Solana\u2019s coin could be on the verge of hitting a new all-time high price.\n\nThe X user Crypto King thinks SOL might reach $300 in the long run, whereas Canfield predicted a future valuation of a whopping $1,000. The latter also advised people to diversify and invest in both Ethereum and Solana:\n\n\u201cNo reason not to have allocations to both. It\u2019s like trying to bet on Microsoft or Google. Tesla or Ford. Just buy both.\u201d"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThere is an ongoing dramatic shift in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world as power is changing hands between Solana (SOL) and the de facto industry leader Ethereum (ETH). Over the past 24 hours, data from DefiLlama shows that Solana has flipped Ethereum in total decentralized exchange (DEX) volume for the first time in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe data shows that Solana has recorded an impressive boost of $1.536 billion in 24 hours, while Ethereum has amassed only $1.164 billion. The weekly change in Solana comes in at 54.21% at the time of writing, while Ethereum suffered more than an 8% decline. This impressive flipping has been labeled by many as a rare occurrence, with Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko acknowledging his disbelief at the huge milestone.\n\nSolana's growth tempo has been encompassing thus far this year as it previously surpassed Ethereum in the NFT sales stat. While the digital currency has the highest growth margin in the year-to-date (YTD) period among the cryptocurrencies in the top 15, it achieved this run at a time when its future was destabilized following the implosion of FTX and the accompanying SOL sell-offs.\n\nWhile the daily flipping has been recorded, Solana now sets sight on outranking XRP in market cap and Ethereum in total value locked (TVL) and cumulative volume.\n\nSolana price outlook\n\nSolana's price is shockingly buckling under its own weight with a menacing sell-off. At the time of writing, Solana is changing hands at a price of $74, down by 5.65%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe ongoing sell-off is reflected in the 5.5% slump in market cap to $31,636,851,169 and the over 20% drop in trading volume to $2,358,903,714. While the sell-off is a major concern, Solana is still relatively in a better place with the price generally trading at its highest level for the year.\n\nSolana's year-to-date growth is 657%, and many see the current price drop as a healthy correction."

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nIt's been another great week for meme coin Bonk (BONK) and the network it runs on.\n\nBONK seemed unstoppable this week\u2014just as it did last week. The dog-themed meme coin is trading for $0.00002364 as of writing, according to CoinGecko. That's a solid rise of 67% over the past seven days, and an utterly bonkers 441% rise over the last two weeks. If you jumped into the fray a month ago, you'd have made your investment back six times over.\n\nTraders were also crazy about Solana last month with investors pouring money into SOL and its related products.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhy? Because people were betting on the cryptocurrency's collapse during the Sam Bankman-Fried trial, but a short squeeze\u2014when the price of an asset shoots up unexpectedly due to forced buying from short sellers\u2014led to the price of SOL to blow up.\n\nThe asset still has some juice in its rally, too: it was up over 6% during the past week and is now trading for $74.11, a more than 20% gain since the start of December.\n\nBONK, a token which runs on SOL, has experienced tremendous gains due to Solana's run. Coinbase, America's biggest crypto exchange, also said it would list the token this week.\n\nBut other meme coins haven't done as well. Dogecoin (DOGE), the 11th biggest digital asset, is down more than 3% over the past day. Over the week, it has dropped even more\u2014by 8%\u2014and is trading for $0.094.\n\nMeanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a precipitous plunge late this week by 4%. It's still up over 17% over two weeks, though.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther altcoins haven't experienced much price action. But Avalanche (AVAX) is the exception: this week it rose to become the 10th biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, overtaking DOGE.\n\nInstitutional investors are eyeing up the asset after banking giant JP Morgan's blockchain Onyx made use of the Avalanche blockchain subnet in a proof-of-concept trial. It's trading at $41.77 now, with solid green across the calendar: up 3% since yesterday, up 27% since last week, and up 78% for the last 30 days.\n\nBitcoin is down nearly 4% over the past seven days and is trading for $42,190 as hype surrounding the approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) seems to have calmed.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

In the first stage, almost a million wallets on Solana will receive a total of 1 billion JUP tokens.\n\nAt the start of December, the Solana defi aggregator launched a website where users eligible for the drop could track how many of the tokens they could receive.\n\nYou might also like: The Next Generation DEX \u2013 Jupiter Finance (JFT) lists on Coinstore\n\nAccording to Jupiter\u2019s website, Jupiter tokens will be used as a governance mechanism, empowering community members to actively participate in approving, sanctioning, and voting on various aspects of the Jupiter platform.\n\nThe platform\u2019s founder outlined the tokenomics of the upcoming tokens, stating that 50% of the total supply will be managed by the team, and the other half will be distributed to the community.\n\nAs stated in his X post, the project head believes building trust between the community and the team is imperative for successful collaboration. They further went on to say a community should have confidence in the team\u2019s abilities by giving them the necessary space to operate, and the team must trust the community, actively involving everyone as stakeholders.\n\nIt will take time, years, but based on what I\u2019m seeing so far, I\u2019m actually incredibly bullish our DAO can get there. Slowly and incrementally for sure, but we will. One reason why I\u2019m so bullish on this is because of the unique, positive, expansive vibes of the Jupiter and Solana community.

Why do I keep fudding my own bags? \u2014 Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) December 16, 2023\n\nIn the last seven days, the DEX has accumulated a trading volume of over $10 billion, stats that Solana enthusiasts are undoubtedly happy about as the Jupiter airdrop draws nearer."
