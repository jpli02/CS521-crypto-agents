        "title": "Dogwifhat (WIF) Coming to Binance? New Solana Meme Coin on High Alert After This Post - U.Today",
        "content": "In the dynamic world of crypto, the spotlight in recent weeks has shifted to the Solana (SOL) ecosystem, in particular witnessing a resurgence in the form of a meme token named Dogwifhat (WIF). As SOL's price action continues to captivate the market, the quirky Shiba Inu puppy donning a knitted hat has become an emblematic figure, driving WIF's meteoric rise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurging from obscurity to prominence, WIF has quickly garnered attention, boasting an impressive capitalization that soared past $150 million, peaking at a staggering $350 million. Midsized exchanges like Crypto.com and MEXC have already embraced the Solana meme, but the community eagerly awaits the potential listing on crypto behemoths Coinbase or Binance.\n\nWIF to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, added fuel to the speculative fire with a cryptic post featuring an image of a tree adorned with a hat bearing the exchange's logo.\n\nThis dog just went from a 5 to 10/10$WIF pic.twitter.com/cde43T2Yq5 \u2014 dogwifcoin (@dogwifcoin) December 27, 2023\n\nAlmost instantaneously, enthusiasts flooded the post with WIF memes, creating a buzz within the community. The official Dogwifhat account joined the frenzy, heightening anticipation for what could be a pivotal moment for the meme coin.\n\nThe crypto giant's apparent nod toward the \"wif hat\" trend has fueled rumors of an impending listing, reminiscent of its historic inclusion of Pepe Coin (PEPE). The crypto market now finds itself on the edge of anticipation, eagerly awaiting confirmation on whether the Dogwifhat token will follow in the footsteps of its meme predecessors and secure a coveted spot on the major crypto trading platform."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\n\n\nSolana (SOL) has seen a price drop to $105 and a fall in market capitalization, resulting in it losing its top four crypto ranking to Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nBNB is experiencing a significant rise, with a recent 25% increase in price in a week and a market cap surpassing $50 billion.\n\nSolana has a rebound potential due to its strong trading volume and success in the NFT market.\n\nThe Latest Shift in the Crypto Market\n\nOne of the best performers in the past several weeks (and throughout the entire year) \u2013 Solana (SOL) \u2013 has recently lost some ground, with its price sliding to $105 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data) and its market capitalization dropping below the $45 billion mark.\n\nAs such, the token lost its position as the fourth-largest crypto asset, with Binance Coin (BNB) taking its place.\n\nThe latter has been on a significant uptrend lately, experiencing a price increase of 25% in the past week and reaching almost $330 (the highest mark since May 2023). In addition, its market cap has exceeded the $50 billion level for the first time in eight months.\n\n\n\nCan Solana (SOL) Respond to the Attack?\n\nIt is worth noting that SOL\u2019s recent pullback might be just a minor correction, which could be followed by another rally in the near future. One factor supporting that thesis is the booming trading volume on the blockchain protocol as of late. According to DefiLlama, that figure has been well above $1 billion since the middle of December.\n\n\n\nThe network has also gained traction in the non-fungible token field. Solana NFT\u2019s sales volume has exceeded $83 million in the past seven days, outpacing Ethereum, whose figure currently stands at approximately $74 million.\n\nThe difference between SOL\u2019s market capitalization and BNB\u2019s is \u201cjust\u201d $5 billion as of the moment and it\u2019s interesting to see which one will come on top during the upcoming year."

        "content": "BONK, a memecoin based on the Solana (SOL) network, has seen a significant price rise since November. The memecoin\u2019s price remained stagnant for most of 2023 but has skyrocketed over the last month.\n\nAlso Read: Here is How To Be a Millionaire When BONK Hits $0.01\n\nBONK\u2019s recent rally follows a listing on Coinbase, one of the most significant crypto exchanges. Moreover, the Solana-based token\u2019s trade volume has surpassed rivals such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Coinbase, exceeding the $30 million mark.\n\nWill the Solana-based memecoin surge further?\n\nSource: NFT Evening\n\nSince January, BONK\u2019s price has surged by over 6700%, making it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in 2023. The token has outperformed the likes of Solana (SOL), which has surged nearly 1000%, and Bitcoin (BTC), which has risen by about 160% in the same time frame.\n\nHowever, despite the recent price spike, the Solana-based token has faced a massive correction, falling by over 14% in the daily charts, over 40% in the weekly charts, and over 12% in the last 14 days. Nonetheless, the memecoin is still up 244.5% over the previous month.\n\nAlso Read: Solana-Based BONK Plunges 40%, Can Santa Fest Spark a Revival?\n\nBONK might continue to falter, given that the token does not have a lot of utility. Moreover, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) dominate the memecoin space, whose performance in 2023 has also been lackluster.\n\nAccording to CoinCodex, the Solana-based memecoin\u2019s price may consolidate around current levels. The platform anticipates BONK to reach $0.00001487 on Jan.1, 2024.\n\nBONK\u2019s recent correction seems to mimic Solana\u2019s (SOL) trajectory. SOL recently hit a yearly high, but the asset\u2019s price has since dropped. SOL is currently down by over 6% in the daily charts. BONK may see a rise in price if SOL picks up momentum. Moreover, the memecoin may rise again if we enter a bull run in 2024."

        "content": "Solana (SOL) co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko blew up Crypto X with a recent admission when he noted that the protocol is now already an \u201cEthereum L2 with the Wormhole Eigenlayer.\u201d\n\nLightning the Solana versus Ethereum Rivalry\n\nThough the shared X post from Anatoly Yakovenko is a technology-based communication, it has a major but subtle aim to lighten the ongoing rivalry between Solana and its bigger rival, Ethereum (ETH).\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to the Solana co-founder, a major overlap exists between some of the validators operating decentralized applications that exist as a connecting bridge between both protocols.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge overlap between solana validators and Lido eth L1 operators and wormhole operators. They are all effectively under heavy \u201cre-staking\u201d incentives not to withhold data or mess with the state root between the chains,\u201d his post reads.\n\nWhile Yakovenko\u2019s initial post on the subject was shared on December 25, media reports failed to see the initial ironic intention behind the post. By all means, Solana is bigger as a protocol when compared to the next capitalized Ethereum L2, Polygon and it has a thriving ecosystem that will undoubtedly prevent it from staying under the shadows of Ethereum.\n\nOver the past few months, there have been a lot of controversial community talks between members of the Solana and Ethereum communities in which some of the former try to elevate their technologies over the latter. This narrative was deepened as Solana started flipping Ethereum in key performance metrics.\n\nYakovenko has time and again tried to caution the community against such narratives and this latest post might be another way to show both can co-exist.\n\nEqual Ecosystem Criticism\n\nWithin the space of 2 weeks, the duo of Ethereum and Solana have faced intense criticism from some market analysts who took out time to highlight the flaws of both protocols.\n\nPeter Brandt recently took on Ethereum, noting that he has shorted the coin as he believes it is on its way to a low of $650. He based his bearish assumptions on the fact that Ethereum is unfriendly to use as a result of expensive network or gas fees. Solana on the other hand got its first major critic in Fred Krueger who said many of the innovations being pushed out by the protocol are \u201cpure science fiction.\u201d\n\nWhile neither of the blockchain protocols is perfect, Yakovenko\u2019s post is an indication that both can truly exist together with more benefit to the broader crypto ecosystem."

The recent uptrend allowed the token to earn a spot on the top five cryptos list as it overtook XRP and BNB Chain [BNB].\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL was trading at $104.37 with a market capitalization of over $44 billion. Now, to better understand how SOL managed to achieve that, AMBCrypto checked the token\u2019s daily chart.\n\nAs per our analysis, SOL\u2019s Bollinger Bands pointed out that the token\u2019s price entered a high volatility zone.\n\nIts MACD also revealed a clear bullish advantage in the market. However, after a comfortable uptrend, SOL\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a downtick from the overbought zone.\n\nA similar trend was also seen in terms of its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which can cause a price correction in the days to follow. In fact, SOL was already down by 6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nIs a further downtrend incoming?\n\nOur analysis revealed that Solana witnessed an increase in sell pressure when its price reached the $127 mark. Soon after that, SOL started to go down and reached its lowest point of $109 this week.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe bad news was that while the token\u2019s price dropped, its Binance funding rate increased. This meant that derivatives investors were actively buying SOL at its lower cost.\n\nNonetheless, the token\u2019s social volume remained consistently high last week, reflecting its popularity in the crypto market. Whether Solana manages to maintain its spot on the top five list despite these setbacks will be interesting to keep an eye on."
