        "content": "Amid a renewed wave of optimism in the cryptocurrency market that has seen most digital assets trading in the green, Solana (SOL) has been one of the best performers, rallying nearly 10% in a single day, and the artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT suggests even more gains for the start of 2024.\n\nAs it happens, Finbold has consulted ChatGPT-4, the most recent model of OpenAI\u2019s famous product, for insights regarding the price of the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it delivered some useful insights from the viewpoint on November 9.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s SOL prediction\n\nSpecifically, based on the online information accessible to it, including historic price trends, technical analysis (TA), and expert predictions, the AI platform has set an optimistic price range of Solana to \u201canywhere from $50 to $150 by the start of 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cA historic price analysis indicates that Solana had a remarkable price surge from its inception in 2020 until now, which, if continues to follow, Solana might see high price growth by 2024.\u201d\n\nFrom a TA perspective, ChatGPT pointed out Solana\u2019s track record as \u201ca strong project backed by robust technology,\u201d which, in addition to the continuous development and projects built on its network, could push the price of its cryptocurrency upward, depending on the growth and success of these projects.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Solana was at press time changing hands at the price of $47.57, up 9.98% in the last 24 hours, adding up to the 7.58% gain across the previous seven days and rallying a whopping 115.39% in the last month alone, according to the latest charts on November 9.\n\nSolana 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, the \u2018buy and sell indicator\u2019 for Solana has recently flashed a massive buy signal despite the reports that wallets owned by disgraced crypto exchange FTX and crypto investment firm Alameda Research involved in the criminal fraud scandal were dumping their SOL.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

This price point extends its overall gains for the year to 388%.\n\nSoaring toward history\n\nSolana has had an exceptional showing thus far this year as the price has made a dramatic recovery since it touched its lowest point at $9.961 earlier in the year. The initial sentiment hinges on the susceptibility of SOL to the bankruptcy events that surrounded the FTX Derivatives Exchange.\n\nKnown as one of its largest holders at the time, normalcy started returning to the market when the court approved sales of FTX assets featuring some altcoins, including Solana. With the sell-off, SOL buyers established a bottom of $17 on Sept. 12, a point that served as a springboard to where SOL is today.\n\nUndoubtedly, the current price growth is the biggest for the coin thus far this year, returning to the level it traded at in early May 2022, long before FTX's implosion. From the level it is at at the moment, SOL is at its prime to mark a new history for the year, as any further resurgence will activate the greed existing in the market moving forward.\n\nLong-term HODLers are beneficiaries\n\nSolana has a lot of supporters with a dedicated community. Those who kept faith in the protocol in its darkest days are the biggest beneficiaries today.\n\nData from CoinMarketCap shows that SOL is now 81.64% away from retesting its all-time high (ATH) of $260.06. With 118% growth in the past month and a 129% surge in the trailing six-month period, Solana has returned a profit to anyone who bought the coin after FTX imploded.\n\nThis is no small feat as even Bitcoin, with its 79% year-to-date (YTD) rate of gain, cannot currently boast of Solana's rate."

        "title": "Who is Anatoly Yakovenko? Solana Founder's Net Worth, Career, and Personal Life - CoinGape",
        "content": "Yakovenko\u2019s technical knowledge combined with innovation has resulted in the scalability-focused Solana blockchain. However, the Ukraine-based founder says that he cannot imagine a world where Solana succeeds because Ethereum 2.0 fails. Let us learn more about his career journey, education, net worth, and personal life in this article.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko is the founder and CEO of one of the Ethereum killers, Solana blockchain. Similar to many of us and other blockchain founders, he made his way from working in a traditional industry to the blockchain industry. Having extensive working experience as a software engineer at Qualcomm, Yakovenko built the high-performance Solana blockchain.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko was born in Ukraine but completed his education and established his career in the United States. He graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a computer science degree. Because of the ongoing dot-com bubble during his education, Yakovenko was advised not to pursue computer science. But, it was a good thing he didn\u2019t listen to them. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have one of the popular Ethereum killers, Solana blockchain today.\n\nCareer Journey of Anatoly Yakovenko\n\nDuring his education at the University of Illinois, Yakovenko founded a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) startup named Alescere. After working with it for more than 3 years, Yakovenko joined Qualcomm as a software engineer and worked with it under prominent roles for more than a decade.\n\nAt Qualcomm, Yakovenko worked on the development of advanced technologies such as virtual and augmented reality products, 3D cameras, and operating systems of mobile devices. After working with several other companies such as Mesosphere and Dropbox, the journey of Solana started.\n\nCEO of Solana Labs\n\nYakovenko was one of the early adopters of Bitcoin and Ethereum and kept a close eye on the emerging blockchain industry. To address the scalability issues and slow transaction processing times of the legacy blockchain networks, Yakovenko founded a new blockchain at the end of 2017. By joining forces with the Qualcomm alumni Greg Fitzgerald, Stephen Akridge, and Raj Gokal, Yakovenko founded the Solana blockchain, named after the popular Solana beach in California.\n\nYakovenko introduced the Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism with Solana instead of relying on the existing Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. This new method promised scalability with faster transaction execution at low fees. The adoption of Solana increased significantly in 2021 and the Solana price went from nearly $2 to $250 in 2021. Despite the ongoing Ethereum 2.0 upgrades, Solana was believed to be the Ethereum Killer throughout the year.\n\nHowever, Solana had to face networth outage issues several times after its price rally. The network couldn\u2019t process the increasing number of transactions, while still being the blockchain with a high TPS of 65,000. However, the network was up and running within 24 hours and Yakovenko claimed that the incident showed the strength of the network.\n\nSolana network performance improved significantly in 2023 with no signs of network outages and had 100% uptime in the first half of the year. The network has been expanding with more and more applications such as Web3 games, NFT projects, and others, along with network developments. And, Anatoly Yakovenko continues to be the CEO of the blockchain.\n\nAchievements\n\nApart from his extensive career journey at Qualcomm and other companies, Yakovenko holds patents to some of the crucial technological developments. The first one was filed in 2017 for general purpose lossless data compression using a recurrent neural network. And, the second patient of Yakovenko was filed in 2018 for lossless compression of content item using a neural network trained on content item cohorts."
