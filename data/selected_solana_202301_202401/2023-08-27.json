        "content": "Solana Labs announced the integration of its decentralized payment protocol \u2013 Solana Pay \u2013 with e-commerce giant Shopify as a new payment option. The move will enable millions of businesses operating on the Shopify platform to leverage Solana Pay for their payment needs.\n\nInitially, USDC payments will be accepted via the integration, but more crypto-assets will added down the line.\n\nSolana Pay x Shopify\n\nAccording to the official press release, Solana Pay will essentially eliminate bank fees, chargebacks, and holding times while allowing immediate, direct payment settlement of USD stablecoins compatible with Solana.\n\nFurthermore, merchants and consumers using Solana Pay will also be able to benefit from Web3-enabled commerce experiences, such as token-gated offers, simple cross-border payments, as well as NFT-based loyalty programs.\n\nCommenting on the development, Solana Foundation\u2019s Head of Commerce Business Development, Josh Fried, said,\n\n\u201cSolana Pay on Shopify opens up millions of merchants to a more dynamic and efficient payment choice, while consumers get the convenience and increased utility of being able to pay for goods and services with digital dollar currencies from the vast network of merchants using Shopify.\u201d\n\nLaunched in February 2022, Solana Pay is an open-source protocol built on top of the layer-1 blockchain Solana. The initial payment option for its integration with Shopify will include USDC, the second-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of nearly $26 billion.\n\nIn a statement provided to TechCrunch, Fried explained that the choice of USDC was deliberate and was influenced by the fact that most merchants are likely to be more receptive to adopting a payment method closely linked to the stability of the US Dollar.\n\nHe went on to add that Circle\u2019s USDC, being subject to higher regulatory oversight compared to other crypto-assets, holds a level of familiarity among consumers already accustomed to transacting in digital dollars. However, Solana Pay remains open to the possibility of incorporating other crypto-assets, including SOL and BONK, into its offerings in the near future.\n\nSolana: 6 Months Without Outage\n\nThe Solana blockchain experienced significant disruptions caused by recurrent outages, some of which persisted for more than a day. However, the subsequent upgrades, such as the implementation of QUIC TPU, Stake weighted QoS, and localized free markets, have improved the network\u2019s capacity to manage substantial traffic and meet demand.\n\nAs a result, Solana maintained uninterrupted service for the past six months and has been 100% uptime since February."

        "title": "Seaside Musings: 'Happiest music I've ever played': Tribute band celebrates Jimmy Buffett - Encinitas Advocate",
        "content": "There\u2019s no need to be a genuine Parrothead to enjoy the music of a Jimmy Buffett tribute band, a seven-piece ensemble of mostly North County performers.\n\n\u201cParrothead\u201d is the name long ago given to Buffett afficionados.\n\nHowever, Chris Maddox of Carlsbad, who leads the 9-month-old band noted in an interview that although everyone might not be a Buffett fan, no one really dislikes him.\n\nBuffett\u2019s music is happy music, say several members of the new band.\n\n\u201cI think the Buffett music is the happiest music I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d said Vasili Panos of Carlsbad, a drummer in the band, which drops a \u201ct\u201d off of the iconic singer-songwriter\u2019s last name and calls itself The Jimmy\u2019s Buffet. \u201cI love it,\u201d Panos said.\n\nBand members chatted during a recent rehearsal for an upcoming gig Sept. 8 at the Belly Up nightclub in Solana Beach.\n\nThey\u2019ve recently played in locales as varied as Brea in Orange County and the Music Box in downtown San Diego.\n\nMaddox likes to note that this isn\u2019t a band of youngsters.\n\nAges range from 45 to 71 and professions, when not belting out the likes of \u201cCheeseburgers in Paradise\u201d and \u201cMargaritaville,\u201d range from attorney to retired math teacher to investment manager (Panos).\n\nThe teacher, Jackie Powers, who taught at Diegue\u00f1o Middle School in Encinitas, is the sole female member of the band. She plays the steel pan, a large drum which emits different tones depending on where it is struck and is an integral part of Caribbean music, strongly incorporated into Buffett\u2019s repertoire.\n\nHe\u2019s been known to refer to it as \u201cCaribbean rock and roll.\u201d\n\nMaddox, head of sales for a global company when not performing, is the group\u2019s vocalist and says often during practice, where he jumps up and down as if there were an audience, that \u201cI\u2019m an entertainer, not a musician.\u201d\n\nHis previous entertainment role, which prompted some national press, was as Elvis.\n\nMaddox had formed a \u201cGraceland\u201d band when in high school in Redondo Beach. It faded in 1997, but he revived it in 2013, and spent several years playing The King, including at concerts at the Del Mar Fairgrounds.\n\nDuring the pandemic, he and his wife, Heather, wrote lyrics for videos filmed in a bedroom closet at their home and posted on social media.\n\nNow, he recites a little of the history of the Mississippi-born Buffett, now 76, a boatsman and pilot who\u2019s had some harrowing accidents in his career. \u201cWe might not be here today,\u201d Maddox said, drawing laughs from his band by saying they might have had to switch to imitating the music of rock band Bon Jovi.\n\nThe other members of the band are:\n\nCraig Harris, bass guitar, from Carlsbad. He\u2019s been playing almost 55 years \u2014 since he was 17 years old. He\u2019s just retired as a wood restorer. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun,\u201d Harris said of playing in the Buffett tribute band. \u201cIt reaches people. The energy is infectious. It\u2019s a wonderful experience.\u201d\n\nJoe Tavano, a keyboardist and songwriter since the 1990s. He\u2019s headed his own tribute and cover bands as well. His synthesizer adds sounds, like from a trumpet, to the mix. An attorney, he lives in Bonita.\n\nIvan Rios, the youngest, a tailor from Escondido, who said Buffett\u2019s music \u201cmakes people dance. It makes them happy. They seem to respond. For me to play in this band is amazing, really fun.\u201d\n\nJohn Brengle \u2014 the name is familiar to North County folks because his grandfather deeded to the city of Vista the land for Brengle Terrace Park. He now lives in the San Carlos area of San Diego. He\u2019s in outside sales for a petroleum company. \u201cI love Jimmy Buffett,\u201d Brengle said.\n\nThe shows, Maddox explained, are more than audio. They\u2019re visual as well.\n\nRe-creating the look of the islands reflected in much of Buffett\u2019s music, the props include swaying palm trees, tiki towers, dancing sharks, beach balls and lots of bubbles.\n\nVisit bellyup.com for more information on the Sept. 8 event."
