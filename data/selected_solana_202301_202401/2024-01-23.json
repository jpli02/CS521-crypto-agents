        "title": "Hedge fund Pantera says Solana's surge shows why this crypto rally will be different - DLNews",
        "content": "Pantera Capital says Bitcoin ETFs won't be the only headline for crypto this year.\n\nBitcoin's DeFi ecosystem, the halving, and tokenisation will all take center stage in 2024.\n\nAnalysts at US crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital wrote in a recent report that the crypto rally was unlikely to be over despite bearish performances across the industry.\n\nLet\u2019s dig into it.\n\nCooling off\n\nThe crypto market has cooled since BlackRock and others launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this month, ushering in a new era for the industry.\n\nBitcoin has slumped 20%, falling from $49,000 to below $39,000, while Ethereum is down 16%. Solana, which outperformed on the way up, is now 30% cheaper than its January top.\n\nVarious crypto stocks \u2014 Coinbase, Marathon Digital, MicroStrategy \u2014 have also taken a beating.\n\nDespite the headwinds, crypto is emerging from the 2022 crash with a much stronger foundation than previous bear markets, said Pantera Capital\u2019s managing partner Paul Veradittakit in the report from January 16.\n\nHis main argument?\n\nLeading crypto projects today aren\u2019t fuelled by pure speculation \u2014 unlike in 2017.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nParty like it\u2019s 2021, not 2017\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, one can say that was speculative froth and hype on unproductive tokens,\u201d Veradittakit said. \u201cWhat\u2019s been interesting about this rally is how little change there has been.\u201d\n\nHe added that while the 2022 downturn was just as harsh on crypto prices as prior bear markets, it wasn\u2019t due to crypto facing an existential crisis.\n\nInstead, prices crashed because of leverage and bad actors, Veradittakit said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it is not surprising that we see the same projects coming back,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not down because they were not good projects, they were down in sympathy with the overall market.\u201d\n\n\u201cSolana is a particularly good example,\u201d Veradittakit added, referring to the coin once backed by FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of seven counts of fraud last year.\n\nSolana has experienced a 975% surge since it bottomed in December 2022.\n\nBitcoin on DeFi rails\n\nBitcoin ETFs aren\u2019t the only headlines the largest cryptocurrency will make this year, Veradittakit said.\n\nThe fourth halving, which will see the network halve how much Bitcoin miners earn to maintain the blockchain, is currently expected in April 2024, he noted.\n\nHalvings have historically preceded hefty rallies for the market\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThey can also be trying times for inefficient mining outfits: With fewer rewards doled out for their work, revenues can take a beating.\n\nVeradittakit also wrote about a rise in Bitcoin\u2019s newly revived programmability, which could lead to an explosion of DeFi activity on the network.\n\n\u201cThere is clearly an enormous demand for Bitcoin in DeFi,\u201d Veradittakit said, citing the $6 billion in wrapped Bitcoin tokens used on other blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nEthereum had $32 billion in total value locked across its DeFi ecosystem \u2014 about 11% of the network\u2019s $280 billion market capitalisation.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s DeFi play could catch up, he said.\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin DeFi infrastructure matures, we could potentially see Bitcoin [DeFi] rise from the current $300 million [in value locked] to 1-2% of Bitcoin market capitalisation \u2014 $10-15 billion at current prices,\u201d he said.\n\nVeradittakit also predicted an explosion in Bitcoin NFT activity thanks partly to the meteoric rise of Ordinals, the network\u2019s take on native non-fungible tokens called inscriptions.\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin has much higher cultural recognition and memetic value, it is possible that web2 brands \u2014 such as luxury retailers \u2014 will choose to release NFTs on Bitcoin, similar to how Tiffany\u2019s partnered with Cryptopunks\u201d in 2022.\n\nOutperforming the market\n\nAnother area of interest was the crossover between traditional finance and crypto technology.\n\n\u201cTradFi assets will be \u2018mirrored\u2019 in DeFi, while crypto assets will have increased exposure in TradFi markets, thus creating TradFi-DeFi \u2018bridges\u2019 that bring these two worlds closer together for increased liquidity and diversification for investors,\u201d Veradittakit said.\n\nThe report also covered the growth of zero-knowledge technology \u2014 particularly the merging of zero-knowledge proofs and modular blockchains.\n\n\u201cIn the upcoming year, I expect this trend to continue, with zero knowledge proofs emerging as an interface between different components of the modular blockchain stack,\u201d Veradittakit said.\n\n\u201cOn the consumer side, zero-knowledge proofs may see increased use cases as a way to preserve identity and privacy, such as in the form of zero-knowledge based decentralised IDs,\u201d he added.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin fell 1.36% from Monday to just under $39,000.\n\nEthereum dropped 4.28%, to trade just above $2,200\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

        "title": "Kingdom of ANTs Will Launch Solana-Powered Platform, Making DeFi Easy and Fun for All - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Kingdom of ANTs\n\nEmbrace AI-driven DeFi solutions. Seamlessly integrated, AI acts as your guide, simplifying complex decisions and strategies.\n\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Jan. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kingdom of ANTs (KOA) aims to revolutionize the DeFi space in 2024. With a gamified platform and a sustainable, long-term APY, they aim to make DeFi accessible, fun, and rewarding.\n\nKOA wishes to change the game using Solana for a faster and smoother user experience. With the integration of AI, users can also expect optimized returns and help with complex DeFi functions.\n\nIn this context, staking will also play a pivotal role for crypto enthusiasts, as it will enable them to earn a passive income in crypto. The project will also launch a collection of 10,000 NFTs that will enhance the user experience.\n\nChanging DeFi Leveraging the Solana Competitive Advantage\n\nKOA will launch its innovative, Solana-based DeFi platform in January 2024. The team has meticulously built and perfected every aspect, from tokenomics to user experience, over the last 18 months.\n\nKOA chose Solana for multiple reasons, such as:\n\nUsing Solana's technology allows for faster transactions and lower user fees. Ultimately, this feature makes the DeFi experience more efficient and cost-effective. Integrating AI into KOA's platform is made possible by Solana's high-speed processing capabilities. The main idea is to allow for precise decision-making and optimized user returns. Building on Solana gives KOA access to a vibrant ecosystem full of opportunities for NFTs and gaming. This allows KOA to create a unique and engaging experience for its users.\n\nThanks to Solana's advantage, KOA aims to revolutionize DeFi, making it accessible and fun for all.\n\nPromising a Sustainable APY Over the Long Term\n\nUnrealistic APY promises are a common issue in Web3. KOA aims to change this narrative. Instead of lofty promises, KOA offers tangible, sustainable yields. This fresh approach stems from an understanding of the volatile nature of DeFi ecosystems.\n\nThe project's strategy focuses on real, achievable gains. The priority is sustainability, not hype. This realistic outlook is part of KOA's DNA. It symbolizes maturity in the highly speculative DeFi sector.\n\nKOA's yield generation model is grounded in the principles of a circular economy. Revenue comes from the sale of in-game assets. This revenue supports the ecosystem, with features such as 60% of the revenue coming from fees flowing to the project\u2019s Treasury.\n\nThe Treasury, backed by solid blue-chip assets, further fortifies the ecosystem. It provides a theoretical floor price for the $ANTC token. This ensures that ANTC holders are not left high and dry.\n\nStory continues\n\nKOA also values transparency, as their dApp offers real-time insights into the Treasury's health. In this context, the team introduces a metric called \u201cRunway.\u201d This measure indicates the number of days that the Treasury can last, with the current reward level, without any inflows.\n\nThe Leveling Mechanism in the Kingdom of ANTs also endorses realistic expectations. It provides a clear pathway for yield growth. As an ANT levels up, the APY increases, up to 90% at Level 40. KOA's goal is to build a sustainable, high-yielding DeFi simulation.\n\nThe \"AI ANT Advisor\" is a game-changer in KOA's treasury management. Excelling at asset allocation, it optimally utilizes the ecosystem's resources. It also manages risk to ensure the treasury's stability. Its algorithms intricately control treasury operations, fostering prosperity. Furthermore, it simplifies complex DeFi strategies into digestible insights, aiming to substantially boost user returns.\n\nAnt Coin ($ANTC) and Its Benefits\n\nANT Coin, or $ANTC, is the Kingdom of ANTS' main token. Holders can acquire it through various means, such as completing tasks or purchasing at a DEX. A percentage of specific in-platform activities is charged as fees in $ANTC, contributing to the platform's sustainability; these collected $ANTC tokens are then burned, reducing the total circulating supply.\n\nWith a circulating supply of 100,000,000 upon launch, $ANTC holders can pay fees and earn sustainable APYs. They also gain voting power in the KOA DAO.\n\nAdditionally, they may receive NFT airdrops and VIP access to exclusive benefits. Holders can also purchase in-game assets with $SOL, with 60% of the sale revenue going back to the treasury. Overall, $ANTC offers various use cases and benefits within KOA's ecosystem. So far, it has been a highly successful token with great potential for future growth and utility.\n\nAbout Kingdom of ANTs\n\nKingdom of ANTs (KOA) is a next-gen, gamified DeFi platform with yield-bearing NFTs under the hood. The team is building it on Solana to deliver a fast, flexible, and low-cost experience.\n\nKOA will shape DeFi\u2019s future, making it super fun, engaging, and easy to use for degens, gamers, and NFT collectors.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just staking: this is an adventure where the user is the hero. Players will make smarter choices with ANT AI\u2019s help, designed to optimize returns and offer personalized insights.\n\nAll players will find that this is their kingdom, playing under their rules. Potential buyers can acquire $ANTC through MEXC or Raydium.\n\nX (Twitter) | Telegram | Discord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT: Niko S. Info at kingdomofants.io\n\n\n\n"
