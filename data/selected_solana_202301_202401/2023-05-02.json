        "content": "Solana is a rapidly growing cryptocurrency network that has been gaining much attention lately. It was founded in 2017 and aims to provide a fast and secure platform. The network is built using a consensus algorithm called Proof of History. It combines both the elements of PoS and PoW. Solana has a very high transaction speed which is faster than various cryptocurrencies. It can handle high volumes which makes it suitable to develop dapps for gaming and more. It uses sharding which splits the blockchain into smaller parts to increase throughput. It has also low transaction fees which makes it suitable for transactions. Solana Open interest has been observing a consolidation over the past few days. It is currently near $237 Million but may observe an increase in the future. SOL social engagement has also been seeing a drop in the past few days. SOL may observe a strong increase in the near future.\n\nSolana has a market cap of $8.5 Billion and is ranked 10th in the crypto-verse. It has seen a drop of 35% in the intraday session. The volume-to-market cap ratio of SOL suggests a consolidated trend in price.\n\nSolana Bears Pushing Price Down\n\nThe weekly technical chart of Solana suggests a struggle between the bears and bulls. On the daily chart, it is forming a strong bearish candle in the daily chart. SOL is currently trading near the value of $21.79 with a small drop in the intraday session. It is trading below the 50 and 100 Daily Moving Averages. There can be a negative crossover in the future which can push the asset price to a new low.

        "content": "Phantom Solana Wallet Adds Ethereum and Polygon Support\n\nPhantom, a self-custodial wallet, has added simultaneous support for Ethereum and Polygon networks to its mobile app and browser wallets. With this update, users can now access dApps across the Web3 landscape, including Uniswap, Aave, blur, OpenSea, and Magic Eden.\n\nThe company aims to simplify managing multiple accounts and assets across blockchains, removing the requirement to switch between wallets and adding the ability to import existing MetaMask, Solana, and EVM wallets.\n\nPhantom first announced support for Ethereum and Polygon in November 2021, with the goal of providing the ability to interact with the three largest blockchains for digital collectibles in one place. According to the company, the new features will simplify managing multiple accounts and assets across blockchains.\n\nPhantom CEO Brandon Millman said the company is dedicated to leveraging its expertise from the Solana ecosystem to drive innovation in the wallet space to deliver the most versatile and user-friendly experience across all platforms, especially the three most prominent ecosystems: Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana.\n\n\"As crypto continues to go multichain, our wallet stands out as the premier choice for users,\" Millman added.\n\nThe Phantom wallet has onboarded over 100,000 users since its Ethereum and Polygon support beta last fall, the company says. In addition to broadening its user base, Phantom has stepped up its security measures in light of a rise in phishing and scam attacks on NFT holders. In January, Phantom said it had scanned over 85 million transactions and blocked over 18,000 wallet-draining transactions.\n\nPhantom's future plans include the introduction of instant NFT sales and the development of a bridge to enable the transfer of assets between the Solana and Ethereum networks. The company believes that the future of digital asset management lies in cross-chain interoperability and is committed to providing its users with the tools and resources they need to easily navigate and transact across various blockchain networks.\n\n\"We believe that the future of digital asset management lies in cross-chain interoperability. We're committed to providing our users with the tools and resources they need to easily navigate and transact across various blockchain networks,\" Co-Founder and CEO Brandon Millman said in a statement.\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

EC Gallery was founded on the premise that the \u201cArt of Discovery\u201d is for everyone.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to have a gallery on Cedros so it was a dream,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Cedros is one of the gems of San Diego.\u201d\n\nGoing back downtown is a little like coming full circle but it will be hard to leave beautiful Solana Beach and its loyal locals behind\u2014she plans to remain in Solana Beach through October and then see what happens; she still may pursue another North County location.\n\nWith the new gallery, she is taking over a historic building at the corner of Fifth and Market, the original home for both Z Gallerie and Lucky Brand. EC Gallery will showcase a stable of over 25 nationally and internationally known artists with individual and group shows throughout the year.\n\nThorn expects the downtown gallery will likely see more tourists than the Cedros location and while North County collectors were a little more traditional in their tastes, she said with the new gallery she will have the opportunity to feature some more contemporary works.\n\nThe new Exclusive Collections Gallery in the Gaslamp.

        "title": "How to Bridge From Solana to Ethereum - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Solana has advanced significantly in the DeFi, NFT, and Web3 markets since its launch in April 2019. Hundreds of projects are currently underway in Solana, and more are soon to follow.\n\nAccording to Solana\u2019s website, \u201clow cost, forever\u201d is the company\u2019s main selling proposition. The network is engaged in direct competition with several blockchains, including Ethereum. Even though there is competition between different blockchains, users would want to bridge from Solana to the Ethereum network. Before we dive into the detailed steps on how to bridge, let us understand what is bridging.\n\nBridging in a nutshell\n\nBridging is nothing but the process of transferring tokens or coins from one blockchain to another one. This is essential as there exist multiple blockchains with each one having their native tokens or coins. The bridge helps to move the assets from one blockchain to another, making the process easier. The process exists in general, especially for cryptocurrencies that don\u2019t have cross-chain support. Bridging is possible through cross-chain bridges and sidechains, etc.\n\nInteroperability between Solana and Ethereum is a fascinating breakthrough in the field of blockchains. It allows users to effortlessly transfer assets between the Solana and Ethereum networks.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of bridging, let us focus on how to bridge from Solana to Ethereum.\n\nHow to bridge from Solana to Ethereum with Allbridge\n\nThere are a few options to look into while bridging from Solana to Ethereum. Let us look at how to do it with Allbridge. Allbridge helps to connect EVM networks like Polgon, and Ethereum with non-EVM chains like Solana, Fantom, and Near.\n\nFollow the steps below to bridge your tokens from Solana to Ethereum:\n\nGo to Allbridge.\n\nConnect your Solley, Phantom, or Exodus wallet.\n\nChoose the option from Solana to Ethereum.\n\nType in the address, select the number of tokens, and click on send to finalize the transaction.\n\nHow to Bridge From Solana To Ethereum using Portal\n\nPreviously known as Wormhole Bridge, Portal Bridge is another good option to go for to move assets between these blockchains. The portal also has better liquidity for various tokens. Here is how you can bridge tokens using Portal Bridge.\n\nVisit the Portal Bridge website.\n\nConnect your Ethereum and Solana wallets.\n\nChoose the token that you want to bridge from SOL and ETH networks.\n\nType in the number of tokens that you want to transfer.\n\nDouble-check and confirm the transaction.\n\nUsing a CEX\n\nWhile the above two options are available, it is also possible to do bridging using a CEX. But doing so also comes with the security risks of a CEX, which one should be wary of. Follow the steps below to bridge tokens from SOL to the ETH network.\n\nOpen your CEX account.\n\nGo to your wallet and transfer ETH from your wallet.\n\nOnce you receive the assets, convert your crypto to a native token, like SOL.\n\nWithdraw your SOL and then send it to your Solana wallet.\n\nWhile it is always better to use portals like Allbridge and Portal, CEX can also be considered as an option to do so. However, CEXs include the necessity to do KYC and submit personal information."
