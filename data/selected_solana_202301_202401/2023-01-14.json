History\n\nNORTHFIELD, Minn. \u2013 The Macalester women's basketball team hit the road this afternoon to take on the Knights of Carleton in Northfield. The Scots put up a good fight, keeping the game close, but were edged out in the fourth quarter, 64-58. Macalester is now 4-9 (3-7 MIAC).After starting 9-3 down, Macalester made quick work of retaking the lead. Senior guard(Minneapolis, Minn./South) sank one from beyond the arc, while first year(Austin, Texas/James Bowie) put up a basket and sophomore guard/forward(St. Louis, Mo./John Burroughs School) completed an and-one to lead 11-9 with 3:17 left in the quarter. Macalester held on to the lead, 13-12, going into the second quarter.The Knights opened the scoring of the quarter, but junior guard(South San Francisco, Calif./Urban School of San Francisco) helped the Scots retake the lead, 19-16, with back-to-back buckets. Starks and Cushing continued to increase the Scots' lead. Corbett finished an and-one at the end of the quarter to lead 30-25 at halftime.Starks quickly made a layup before the Knights would go on an 8-0 run to retake the lead, 33-32. The teams went back-and-forth, with five lead changes in the quarter. Sophomore(Brussels, Wis./Southern Door), sophomore guard/forward(Chicago, Ill./Walter Payton College Prep), and Starks each knocked in baskets, but it was the Knights who maintained a 40-39 lead heading into the fourth quarter.The Knights opened the final 10 minutes on a 12-4 run, but the Scots would not be deterred. Macalester continued to fight, starting with a three-pointer from Cushing, with 4:11 on the clock left in the quarter. Pedrosa and junior guard(North Andover, Mass./Andover) also knocked in threes, but the Knights shot well from the line, and Macalester fell 64-58.Starks once again led the team offensively with 19 points and four assists. She also tallied six steals and seven rebounds. Both Norquist and Panos also registered four assists, with NorquistMacalester's next game will be on Monday January 16. The Scots will be at home, hosting Concordia at 7:15 p.m."

        "content": "Last month the Santa Fe Irrigation District swore in incumbent board members Michael Hogan, Sandra Johnson and Andy Menshenk, who all ran unopposed in the November election, and welcomed an additional new board member, Ron Magnaghi. Director Magnaghi was appointed by San Diego County Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer to represent Division 1, which includes areas of east Solana Beach and Rancho Santa Fe.\n\nMagnaghi replaces Ken Westphal, who was appointed by the board last February to fill the remainder of Frank Creede\u2019s term.\n\nAt the board\u2019s organizational meeting, they also unanimously voted to approve Director Hogan as president and Director Dana Friehauf as vice president. This is Hogan\u2019s eighth term as board pesident and Vice President Friehauf\u2019s first term.\n\n\u201cIt is my honor to serve as president of this board once again, and I appreciate the support and confidence from my colleagues,\u201d said President Hogan in a news release. \u201cOur district has a big year ahead of us in 2023, as we prepare to celebrate our 100-year anniversary, finalize our cost of service and rate structure, and deal with the ongoing drought. We are all dedicated to providing our customers with a sustainable, cost-effective, and reliable water future for our customers.\u201d\n\nThis will be Hogan\u2019s 15th year on the board\u2014he will continue to be a member of the executive committee and serves as the SFID representative to the San Diego County Water Authority, the region\u2019s wholesale supplier.\n\nVice President Friehauf, elected to the board in 2020, will also sit on the executive committee and as vice chair of the Association of California Water Agencies Region 10 Board, which represents San Diego and Orange Counties.\n\nMagnaghi, the board\u2019s newest member from Solana Beach, is the senior managing director at Newmark, a commercial real estate company. During his 31-year brokerage career in San Diego he has focused on representing business service, high-tech, educational and other growth-oriented companies.\n\nSanta Fe Irrigation District is in the process of setting new water rates for its 20,000 customers in the city of Solana Beach and portions of Rancho Santa Fe and Fairbanks Ranch.

        "title": "Earning interest on BTC: How your money can be exposed to unnecessary risks - Coin Culture",
        "content": "Investors who aspire to hold their crypto assets long term, are often known as HODLers in the crypto sphere, generally keep their bitcoin in a hardware wallet or cryptocurrency exchange. However, this practice is evolving.\n\nCurrently, some HODLers are opting for cryptocurrency exchanges with great interest rates on cryptocurrency deposits. The interest rates on traditional bank deposits are very low \u2013 often around 1.5% (for example, the saving rate at CommonWealth Bank Australia is 1.30%) \u2013 when compared to the crypto equivalent, you are able to earn up to 12% annual percentage yield (APY) on certain coins.\n\nBinance Australia, Crypto.com. Celcius, Nexo and Swyftx are some popular crypto exchanges that offer a very high APY for BTC. For instance, you can earn up to 4.08% APY on your BTC on Swyftx, 5% APY on Celsius, 7% APY on Nexo and 8.19% APY on Binance Australia. These interest rates are incredibly attractive, but where the yields come from is of great concern for investors.\n\nUndoubtedly, great risk generally accompanies high profit, which holds true with cryptocurrencies and crypto earn wallets. Trust and due diligence are essential on the side of the investor.\n\nHow it Works\n\nTo comprehend the degree of risk you\u2019re putting yourself in, you need to understand what goes on behind the scenes.\n\nWhen you put crypto assets into a wallet that earns interest, the platform will lend those coins to individuals , organisations, or institutions. The crypto lent is often used for a number of business purposes, from market making, Bitcoin price hedging to liquidity management.\n\nDue to high interest, the borrowers return the assets to the lenders. The platform retains a small percentage of the interest and gives the remainder to its users. You can also lend your funds to decentralised protocols and earn interest.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Risk?\n\nHODLing in a BTC interest wallet exposes investors to a variety of risk types. Since Bitcoin is considered a digital asset, investors are vulnerable to attacks from bad parties. The likelihood of a breach relies significantly on the platform\u2019s security mechanisms. It can be vulnerable to a security compromise without encryption or a robust safety infrastructure. Companies not regulated or licensed with government registrations may be targets of cybercriminals.\n\nIn addition, a platform that holds your tokens in a hot wallet can be susceptible to assault. Traders want a hot wallet for expedited transactions. As public and private keys are stored on the internet, this form of storage might be risky.\n\nAnother risk linked with crypto financing is the possibility of borrower default. Investors may be exposed to significant risk if a lender does not impose stringent criteria on its counterparties. If the company\u2019s lending rules are not disclosed, it may be a worrying sign. The latest news surrounding Celsius is a good example of a cryptocurrency lender that encountered a liquidity crisis, meaning they did not have enough coins on hand if their users attempted to cash out\n\nWhat to Consider when choosing a Crypto Exchange?\n\nWhile investigating crypto platforms to deal with, you should check for 3 primary aspects: fees, safety standards and customer support rather than interest rates, which is not something a crypto exchange prioritises.\n\nFees\n\nWhen selecting a crypto exchange, fees should be one of your first considerations. Most exchanges impose a nominal fee on each transaction and impose fees and limitations on withdrawals. You can refer to our detailed reviews of crypto exchanges, such as our CoinSpot Fee Review, to learn more about the fee structure of crypto exchanges.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s better to compare all costs charged by the exchange. Typically, most exchanges charge a 1% transaction fee, which is reduced as your trading volume grows. Others charge excessively high withdrawal fees for some altcoins, and some others allow users to acquire cryptocurrencies using a credit or debit card with a fee of 5% or more.\n\nSafety Standards\n\nAs crypto has become more popular and lucrative, hackers have been more interested in it. The hacking of prominent cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin has resulted in the loss of tens of millions of dollars. Although exchanges often pay people whose coins are stolen, nobody wants to be in this situation.\n\nWhether you need to store your crypto assets on an exchange permanently or for a while before transferring them to your wallet, the exchange\u2019s security should be your first concern. Consider, for example, how much of the exchange\u2019s assets are kept offline in hard storage.\n\nYou can also seek exchanges with high-level security measures, such as two-factor authentication. Each time you log in, you will be required to enter 6 digit code to authenticate your identity, this code will be generated via an authenticator app. Also, choose crypto exchanges with certifications or have met security standards if you seek peace of mind when trading or storing your digital assets.\n\nCustomer support\n\nNot all crypto platforms offer adequate customer support. This is unfortunate, as you will want an exchange that can respond quickly to your needs if your account ever experiences issues.\n\nChoose an exchange that provides 24/7 customer service and allows you to reach the support crew quickly. This is an invaluable feature that will significantly enhance your experience when selecting a cryptocurrency exchange with a responsive support team. You can determine this by searching for online reviews on sites like Trustpilot.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCrypto banking is still in its infancy compared to regular banking; thus, it is necessary to assess your risks. Due to the lack of regulation, crypto is mostly a speculative asset. For this reason, you must investigate the security features, rules, and history of breaches or defaults of any platform you are considering."

        "title": "Presenting... the Bentley of blockchains - Milk Road",
        "content": "Gm. This is Milk Road. The daily newsletter that brings you the best news from crypto, rain or shine.\n\nI don't know if you checked your portfolio but prices are up BIG.\n\nWe haven't seen this much green since Saint Paddy's day.\n\nETH is up 9% and Bitcoin is up 11% since Friday. Some people think this is a dead cat bounce, but after the year we just had, we'll take it.\n\nNow, onto the good stuff\u2026\n\nBlockchains.\n\nWe all use \u2018em. Everyone talks about \u2018em. But not many people know how they actually work.\n\nAnd the reality is that\u2019s okay, because\u2026 Blockchains are a lot like cars.\n\nPeople use them all the time. They get us from Point A \u2192 Point B. But no one really knows what\u2019s going on under the hood or what a Catalytic Converter does.\n\n(Except my mechanic Rico, that mfer is the Car Whisperer.)\n\nThe important thing you need to know is there are different cars for different use cases.\n\nYou don\u2019t wanna use a Fiat car for your 8-person family. Unless you\u2019re performing at the next Cirque du Soleil.\n\nYou don\u2019t wanna use a Diesel-powered Ford F-150 Raptor to drive around New York City. Unless you wanna end up on the cover of Villains of the Environment.\n\nYou don\u2019t wanna use a Volkswagen Beetle to drive in the jungle. Unless you wanna end up stranded and on an improv episode of Survivor.\n\nYou get the point \u2013 different cars for different cases.\n\nBlockchains are the same way. There is no \u201cone-blockchain-fits-all.\"\n\nOne blockchain might be faster, while another is more secure. One might be better for NFTs, while another is better for decentralized finance apps.\n\nWhich is exactly why we\u2019re big believers that the future of crypto is multichain.\n\nSo today, we\u2019re presenting the Milk Road Blockchain Show. Where we\u2019ll take a look under the hood to better understand some of the blockchains and what they\u2019re good for.\n\nAnd we\u2019re teaming up with a special friend to make it all happen\u2026\n\nthirdweb \u2013 they provide tools for companies and developers to build Web3 apps. thirdweb doesn\u2019t just think the future of crypto is multichain, they\u2019re building tools compatible with over 10 different blockchains, including every single EVM chain.\n\nFirst up, we got\u2026\n\nBITCOIN\n\nBitcoin is la creme-de-la-creme of crypto. When you think of Bitcoin, you think of things like\u2026.\n\nLuxury. Security. Durability. And of course, OG status.\n\nSo it\u2019s only right to compare Bitcoin to\u2026 *drumroll* \u2026The Bentley.\n\nHere\u2019s how Bitcoin and Bentleys are similar:\n\n1/ Both are slow to produce\n\nBentleys might be fast, but they\u2019re one of the slowest producing manufacturers out there.\n\nIn total, it takes 400+ hours to produce one single Bentley Mulsanne. ~136 hours are spent just on the interior trim.\n\n(Almost as long as my wife takes on her eyeliner. As she says, \"Beauty takes time\u201d.)\n\nBitcoin is the same way \u2013 it's the slowest blockchain out there.\n\nIt can only process 7-10 transactions per second and the average transaction time is ~10 minutes. (But those numbers are on a good day \u2013 when the stars are aligned, the moon is full, and LeBron is hitting all his 3\u2019s.)\n\nSometimes transactions can take up to 60 minutes. Which is why all Bitcoin users know this pain\u2026\n\n2/ Both take a lot of energy & work to produce\n\nFun fact: it takes ~45 people to build one single Bentley W12 engine. And some of those lucky people have to go through a 600-point checklist before the final sign-off.\n\nIn other words, it takes a f*ck ton of energy & work to make the Bentley go vroom.\n\nBitcoin is the same way. Its what\u2019s called a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain. Now, we won\u2019t go into all the nitty gritty details of what PoW is, but all you need to know is\u2026\n\nIt takes a lot of work & energy to maintain the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nUses 7x more energy than Google\u2019s global operations\n\nUses more energy than countries like Denmark, Chile, Finland, and the Netherlands\n\n1 BTC transaction uses as much energy as 50 days of power for the avg US house\n\nBut all this time & energy are needed. And that\u2019s because\u2026\n\n3/ Both are secure & durable\n\nYou see, blockchains have a trilemma between being scalable, being decentralized, or being secure. And they can only pick 2 out of those 3\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a lot like the college trilemma \u2013 you have to pick between good grades, a good social life, or good sleep. Which is why the Milk Man was living on Red Bull and 26-minute power naps. (Don\u2019t try this at home, kids.)\n\nWhat Bitcoin lacks in scalability, it makes up for in security & decentralization. It\u2019s one of the most secure & durable blockchains out there. It\u2019s lasted 14+ years and hasn\u2019t had a major hack take it down, yet.\n\nBentleys are similar \u2013 they\u2019re all about durability & security. ~80% of all Bentleys ever created are still functional (#BuiltDifferent).\n\nThey even have bullet-proof cars for celebs & royalty like Queen Elizabeth (R.I.P.), James Bond, and the Milk Man.\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\n4/ Both are symbols of luxury & have unique use cases\n\nBitcoin & Bentley are both expensive.\n\nBTC hit an all-time high of $69k and has the largest market cap out of any crypto\n\nBentleys can cost up to ~$300,000\n\nIn other words, if someone owns Bitcoins or Bentleys\u2026 you\u2019ll know it. They\u2019ll be at your nearest Country Club or SoHo House talking about it. And yes, I\u2019ll eavesdrop to hear how many they own.\n\nWhich makes Bentleys & Bitcoin good for one thing.\n\nBentleys are a good weekend-flex car. You aren\u2019t gonna use a Bentley to drive in the city much or use it to help you move.\n\nBitcoin is good as a secure, decentralized, financial asset. Do you like money but don\u2019t like the government? Bitcoin is your answer.\n\nBut you aren\u2019t really going to use the Bitcoin blockchain for NFTs or Decentralized applications.\n\nThat\u2019s where other blockchains come in\u2026\n\nETHEREUM\n\nEthereum can do a lot of things. You can build DeFi apps. You can create NFTs. You can use it as a financial asset.\n\nIt\u2019s a multi-purpose chain. So it\u2019s only right to compare Ethereum to\u2026 Toyota.\n\nHere\u2019s how Ethereum & Toyota are similar:\n\n1/ Both are versatile\n\nToyotas are used for anything and everything.\n\nGot kids? Say Hello to the Toyota Sienna. The King of all Mini Vans.\n\nWant speed? Look no further than the Toyota Supra.\n\nWant comfort & convenience? Roll up in the Toyota Corolla.\n\nWant to pull a mountain? The Toyota Tundras got your back.\n\nWant to save the environment? Have no fear, the Toyota Prius is here.\n\nEthereum is the same way. All the most popular NFTs, DeFi apps, etc are on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThat\u2019s because Ethereum is scalable. Remember the blockchain trilemma? Well, Vitalik and the Ethereum founders decided to prioritize scalability above all.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all thanks to something called smart contracts. In simple terms, they\u2019re computer programs stored on the blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nIt lets users transact securely & anonymously without having to go through a central authority. Smart contracts are at the core of everything on Ethereum. (DeFi apps, NFTs, etc all use em\u2019.)\n\n2/ Both are eco-friendly\n\nRemember how much work & energy it takes to complete a Bitcoin transaction?\n\nWell, Ethereum is the opposite. It\u2019s now running on what\u2019s called Proof-of-Stake (PoS,) which a lot less energy consuming than PoW.\n\nEthereum used to use PoW, but it made the switch over to PoS last year during The Merge.\n\nWhy? By using PoS, Ethereum is using 99.99% less energy than it did before. In other words, it went from a Toyota Supra (sports car) to a Toyota Prius (eco-friendly, hybrid car.)\n\nWe won\u2019t go through all the specifics here, but if you wanna learn more about it here\u2019s an amazing thread by our friend Jon Wu. The best part is he explains it like a mechanic with a Brooklyn accent\u2026 fuhgeddaboudit.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard about Ethereum Layer 2 solutions and how they promise to scale the Ethereum network and reduce gas fees. It\u2019s a little confusing. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here to explain ETH L2 to you like a mechanic from Brooklyn: \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udd27 https://t.co/EHcWo3UOFO \u2014 jonwu.eth (@jonwu_)\n\nMay 27, 2021\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\n3/ Both are super popular, which means it can get expensive to use\n\nEthereum has become one of the most used blockchains.\n\nThe most popular NFT collections like Bored Ape, Crypto Punks, etc and DeFi apps like Uniswap, Compound, and Aave are all on Ethereum. Which is great\u2026\n\nExcept for the fact that the more popular Ethereum has become, the more expensive it is to use the blockchain to complete transactions. No bueno.\n\nWhen things are busy on the Ethereum blockchain, it can sometimes cost you up to $100+ just in transaction fees. It\u2019s one of the big downsides of using Ethereum right now.\n\nWhich is where Layer 2s come in\u2026\n\nLAYER 2s\n\nTo help explain, let\u2019s go back to the Toyota comparison. Toyotas are one of the most popular cars out there. And it\u2019s now become the most used car for\u2026\n\nUber rides.\n\nBut as more people use Uber, the more expensive it gets. AKA if you\u2019re using Uber on a Friday night, you\u2019re gonna need to take out a loan from the bank beforehand.\n\nThat\u2019s where Layer 2s come in. You can think of them as yellow taxi cabs.\n\nSure, they\u2019re not as convenient or prestigious and sometimes smell like vomit from the drunk guy the night before. BUT\u2026\n\nThey make it cheaper, faster, and more scalable to do transactions on Ethereum. And there are a few L2s that have been making some noise recently:\n\nARBITRUM\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup. It makes transactions a lot cheaper & faster.\n\nTo compare, sending ETH will cost ~$0.05 on Arbitrum vs $0.82 on Ethereum's main network. (16x cheaper)\n\nAnd our friends at thirdweb tell us Arbitrum has put up big numbers on their supported blockchain. There have been 10k+ transactions, 500+ unique smart contracts, and 400+ unique deployers.\n\nPOLYGON\n\nPolygon is a decentralized Ethereum scaling platform. And it was a top contender for MVP (Most Valuable Protocol) of 2022.\n\nIt had the biggest partnerships of the year \u2013 including with Starbucks, JP Morgan, and Disney. And its usage & adoption has exploded recently.\n\nNumber of transactions on Polygon smart contracts (deployed on thirdweb.)\n\nOctober: 166,481\n\nNovember: 232,203\n\nDecember: 592,738\n\nOPTIMISM\n\nOptimism is a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain \u201cbuilt by Ethereum developers, for Ethereum developers.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s also seen a huge spike in activity recently. Optimism transactions on thirdweb jumped 6,000% month on month in December. They had 350k+ transactions, 400+ unique contracts, and 100+ deployers.\n\nIn a nutshell: The Layer 2 Wave is here. A bunch of DeFi apps, NFT collections, etc are all being built using L2s on Ethereum.\n\nSOLANA\n\nSolana is built for one thing\u2026 speed. The creators of Solana were a lot like Tom Cruise in Top Gun.\n\nThey feel the need, the need for speed.\n\nSo, it\u2019s only right to compare Solana to\u2026 The Alfa Romeo.\n\nHere\u2019s how Solana & Alfa Romeo are similar:\n\n1/ They\u2019re both super fast\n\nAlfa Romeo can hit the speed of 200 mph and can hit 0-to-60 in under 3.6 seconds.\n\nSolana is one of the fastest blockchains out there. It can complete ~65k transactions per second. It\u2019s 10,000 times faster than Bitcoin. 4,000 times faster than Ethereum. 2x faster than a bullet or Usain Bolt.\n\nIf you wanna go fast, use Solana. It\u2019s currently used a lot by game developers and users that prefer a faster blockchain.\n\nBut be warned. With speed comes\u2026\n\n2/ Both have performance issues\n\nSolana and Alfa Romeo are both known to break down more than the McDonalds ice cream machine.\n\nSolana went down 8 times last year\n\nAlfa Romeos are known for breaking down at least once within the first few months of usage. If you don\u2019t know where your local car shop is, you will now.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWell ladies & gents, that\u2019s a wrap for this year's Milk Road Car Show. And remember, the future is multichain. There will always be different chains for different cases.\n\nThere are a bunch of blockchains we didn\u2019t cover here, so if you\u2019d want a Part 2 reply to this email with \u201cEncore please!\u201d\n\nFor blockchains to grow, they need developers.
