        "content": "Solana Pay, the decentralized payment protocol by Solana Labs, has integrated with Shopify. This strategic integration allows millions of businesses on Shopify\u2019s platform to leverage Solana Pay for crypto transactions with zero transaction fees until 2024.\n\nA post on the Solana official X profile, linking to a TechCrunch article read;\n\n\u201cToday, Solana Pay integrates with Shopify, empowering the millions of entrepreneurs and merchants on Shopify to accept fast, web3 native payments with no transaction fees through the end of 2023.\u201d\n\nLaunched in Feb. 2022, Solana Pay is built on Solana, and the initial payment option for this integration is USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. The choice of USDC, as Josh Fried of Solana Foundation told TechCrunch, is strategic, given its close ties to the dollar and its regulatory oversight. However, he hinted at future considerations for adding SOL.\n\nSolPay is also integrated into the Solana Saga mobile phone and available on any device connected to a Solana wallet. The Saga had its price slashed at the start of August to just $599, down from $999 at launch.\n\nSolana and Shopify partnership benefits.\n\nOver 11 million active accounts on Solana will potentially gain access to Shopify businesses, which, according to TechCrunch, make up 10% of total U.S. e-commerce and $444 billion of global economic activity. However, companies will likely have to activate Solana Pay in their merchants\u2019 dashboards to accept payments.\n\nFried reiterated to TechCrunch the vital role of payments in the crypto space, stating,\n\n\u201cSome people argue the killer app for crypto hasn\u2019t arrived, but it has: it\u2019s payments.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment reflects the hope of shifting towards decentralized payment platforms that aim to reduce business transaction costs. Credit card processing fees usually cost a business up to 5% per transaction. In contrast, the average cost per transaction on Solana\u2019s blockchain is one-fortieth of a cent.\n\nThe partnership could also enable merchants to set up loyalty programs with minimal development effort. According to Fried, these reward systems could be as simple as launching NFT loyalty tokens that are burnt when a consumer checks out using Solana Pay.\n\nThis development, however, comes amid the backdrop of significant changes within the crypto market landscape, as some major cryptocurrencies, including SOL, were recently delisted by Robinhood, Bitstamp, and Revolut following SEC lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.\n\nMentioned in this article"

By eliminating intermediaries, Solana Pay eliminates bank fees, chargebacks and holding times, while enabling immediate payment settlement using USD stablecoins compatible with the Solana network.\n\nJosh Fried, head of commerce business development at the Solana Foundation, said in the release that the integration of Solana Pay on Shopify opens up numerous possibilities for merchants and consumers alike.\n\n\u201cSolana Pay on Shopify opens up millions of merchants to a more dynamic and efficient payment choice, while consumers get the convenience and increased utility of being able to pay for goods and services with digital dollar currencies from the vast network of merchants using Shopify,\u201d Fried said.\n\nOne of the key advantages of adopting Solana Pay is the gateway it provides to Web3-enabled commerce experiences, according to the press release. These experiences include token-gated offers, simple cross-border payments and non-fungible token (NFT)-based loyalty programs. By embracing Solana Pay, businesses can cater to their Web3-savvy customers and tap into the growing demand for Web3-native payment options.\n\nThe decentralized Solana network upon which Solana Pay is built is known for its high transaction speeds, near-zero fees and sustainability, the release said.\n\nSeveral prominent brands that are already active on Solana, such as MonkeDAO, MadLads, Helius and Solana\u2019s merch store, have committed to integrating Solana Pay as a payment option in their Shopify-powered storefronts, per the release. By offering Solana Pay, these brands recognize the opportunity to provide their customers with a Web3-native payment solution, aligning with the evolving landscape of digital commerce.\n\nSolana Pay was launched in February 2022 as a low-cost, instant crypto-payment tool for everyday purchases. This point-of-sale (POS) payment product lets merchants accept USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin and other cryptocurrencies for online and in-store payments.\n\nPYMNTS research has found that 35% of tech-driven consumers prefer merchants that take crypto. Beyond that, 26% of these consumers said they would go so far as to switch merchants to shop where crypto is accepted, according to \u201cShopping With Cryptocurrency: Tech-Driven Consumers Drive Market Acceptance,\u201d a PYMNTS and BitPay collaboration."

        "content": "Solana Pay, a decentralized payment protocol by Solana Labs, has integrated its plug-in with Shopify, allowing millions of businesses on its platform to use it for payments, TechCrunch was told exclusively.\n\nSolana Pay launched in February 2022 and is built on top of the layer-1 blockchain Solana. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of $25.9 billion, will be the initial payment option for this integration, Josh Fried, business development and partnerships at Solana Foundation, told TechCrunch.\n\nGoing with USDC first wasn\u2019t unintentional. Most merchants are probably more willing to accept something so closely tied to the dollar. USDC is also more regulated than, say, many altcoins, and consumers in general are already used to transacting in digital dollars. But the protocol will consider adding cryptocurrencies like SOL and BONK in the future, Fried said.\n\nShopify accounts for 10% of total U.S. e-commerce and $444 billion worth of global economic activity, according to its website. The Solana ecosystem has over 11.5 million active accounts; Solana Pay has been adopted by big crypto names like Circle and Phantom as well as payment processors like Checkout.com and Citcon.\n\n\u201cSome people argue the killer app for crypto hasn\u2019t arrived, but it has: it\u2019s payments,\u201d Fried said. \u201c[Everyone] should be doubling down on this.\u201d\n\nCredit card processing fees usually cost a business between 1.5% and 3.5% per transaction, but using the Solana Pay option is practically \u201cfee-free,\u201d Fried said. The average cost per transaction on Solana\u2019s blockchain is $0.00025, or fractions of a penny. Of course, Solana has dealt with downtime issues in the past, which in itself has a cost. But the blockchain reported 100% uptime in Q2, so things are getting better. It\u2019s also worth noting that Shopify also entered the credit card space in July by launching its own business credit card for merchants.\n\nThe integration can also help merchants set up loyalty programs with \u201clittle development,\u201d Fried said. These reward systems can be as simple as launching NFT loyalty tokens that would transpire when a consumer checks out and if they return to buy something again and use Solana Pay, the store can give them a discount.\n\nA few crypto-focused teams and brands like Helius, Mad Lads and MonkeDAO have also agreed to integrate Solana Pay on their Shopify storefronts, Fried shared. Any Solana-centric crypto wallet that has integrated with Solana Pay, like Phantom, Solflare and Glow, will be able to connect to the plug-in.\n\nShopify isn\u2019t a stranger to crypto payment options, either. In February, it launched a number of blockchain-enabled commerce tools and features to help merchants build tokengating applications. Shopify already integrates with other payment applications like Coinbase Commerce, Strike, Crypto.com and BitPay.\n\nIn general, Solana Labs sees its blockchain as \u201cperfectly suited for payments,\u201d Fried said. There\u2019s no intermediaries, bank fees, chargebacks and holding times, he said. \u201cYou need speed at the point of sale for merchant payments. No one wants to sit on a website to wait for wallet transactions. Similarly in a point of sale in a store, can you imagine waiting three minutes for your payment to go through? No one wants to do that.\u201d"
