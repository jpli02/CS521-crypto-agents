        "title": "Solana unveils ChatGPT plugin that retrieves on-chain data - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Solana Labs has revealed a ChatGPT plugin that will allow chatbot users to interact with the Solana blockchain, as seen in a tweet on April 25.\n\nSolana launches ChatGPT plugin\n\nSolana Labs said that users will be able to use the plugin to check wallet balances, transfer tokens, and purchase NFTs from within ChatGPT.\n\nIn one screenshot, a user asks for a list of NFTs owned by a particular Solana address. In a second sample image, a user asks for help sending a Solana transaction to another address, and in a third, a user asks for help purchasing an NFT. Each prompt returns the relevant instructions or information in natural language.\n\nTechnical details on GitHub also suggest that the plugin can retrieve data about account balances, assets held, transactions, signatures, NFT collections, and more.\n\nSolana did not state when a plugin will be launched for general use but said that developers can create their own plugins using the project\u2019s source code.\n\nThe project\u2019s GitHub page also suggests that the tool can currently be installed as an unverified plugin by using the address https://solana-gpt-plugin.onrender.com.\n\nOther blockchain AI tools\n\nNews of Solana\u2019s ChatGPT plugin arrives alongside various other AI services and initiatives related to cryptocurrency services and projects.\n\nBinance launched a ChatGPT-powered \u201cSensei\u201d chatbot on April 24, while Visa announced plans to hire an AI-focused blockchain developer that same day.\n\nCrypto-integrated browsers are also adding AI features. Opera also announced an AI-integrated version today called Opera One. Brave, meanwhile, integrated an AI-powered \u201csummarizer\u201d tool into its search engine in early March.\n\nOutside of the blockchain industry, individuals linked to Marvel Studios and Epic Games have spoken about the potential of AI in the entertainment industry.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Mad Lads is the biggest thing in NFTs right now, as the Solana profile picture (PFP) project overcame alleged extortion threats and DDOS attacks to mint out last week\u2014and has generated over $15 million worth of trading volume since.\n\nIt\u2019s a bright spot for the Solana world after some rough months. Solana\u2019s token and vibes were rocked by the collapse of exchange FTX and the downfall of close ally Sam Bankman-Fried in November. And then in December, the creator of Solana\u2019s prominent NFT projects DeGods and y00ts announced that both would leave for other chains, which ultimately happened in March.\n\nArmani Ferrante, a longtime Solana developer and co-founder and CEO of Mad Lads creator Coral, told Decrypt this week that the chain\u2019s community had \u201cbeen in this very dark, very crazy kind of place\u201d since the FTX collapse, and that it \u201chad its soul-forging moment\u201d in that span.\n\n\u2018Honeypot Bitch\u2019: How Mad Lads Tricked Bots Into Spending $250K on Fake NFTs\n\nFerrante added that \u201cNFTs are super important for the network,\u201d and described the departure of DeLabs\u2019 DeGods to Ethereum and y00ts to Polygon as creating a chasm in the community.\n\n\u201cThere was this void,\u201d he explained, \u201cwhere the heart and soul of the NFT space needed to kind of have a new heartbeat, basically.\u201d\n\nIn that sense, he chalked part of the buzzy Mad Lads response to coincidental timing, as the project was ready to launch just weeks after those projects effectively departed Solana. But Ferrante also credited the reputation and community goodwill that he and fellow Coral co-founder Tristan Yver had built up in the space over the years.\n\nFock it.

Essentially, rather than use NFTs as an access pass to token-gated content on other platforms or websites, they can contain experiences and exclusive content that\u2019s accessible through Backpack.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Mad Lads mint was the first big launch for Backpack, which was announced last June. For Mad Lads, Coral developed an in-app story experience that resembled \u201ca collective boss battle\u201d against the Mad King, almost like a raid in the hit online game World of Warcraft. It was part game, part social quest, and altogether a shared experience for NFT holders.\n\n\u201cYou don't have to worry about creating new websites for your user experience,\u201d Ferrante said of xNFTs. \u201cYou just use the NFT, and this is an incredible opportunity for creators to build new stories and create a new meta where the artwork is no longer just a piece of artwork.\u201d\n\nSo WTF are xNFTS? pic.twitter.com/LGjvHh2JFx \u2014 Mad Armani \ud83c\udf92 (@armaniferrante) June 20, 2022\n\n\u201cIt's also a living, breathing piece of computer code that can do anything,\u201d he added.\n\nBeyond self-contained games and other types of token-gated experiences for holders, Ferrante also sees potential for NFT project creators to \u201cget leverage with marketplaces,\u201d for example, trading potentially valuable screen \u201creal estate\u201d within their apps and pointing collectors to certain trading platforms.\n\nBackpack is available in a public beta on mobile and web right now, and while xNFTs are currently permissioned due to ongoing security audits, Ferrante said, the long-term goal is to open it up to the community for anyone to build on.\n\n\u201cThe intention is: once we're confident in the security,\u201d he said, \u201cwe'll take the permissioning off.\u201d\n\nFerrante promised a wave of planned announcements ahead around Backpack, including Mad Lads-related content and experiences. And longer-term, Coral wants to go broadly multi-chain with it. Currently, Ethereum is supported through the Wormhole cross-chain bridge, but Ferrante wants to see community developers help add more protocols\u2014including Bitcoin and Ordinals.\n\nDeGods and y00ts Are Leaving Solana\u2014Here\u2019s How It\u2019s Going to Work\n\n\u201cOne of the big ambitions for Backpack is to have every protocol and every blockchain inside of a single user interface,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Ferrante\u2019s view, Mad Lads\u2019 ascent within not only the Solana NFT space, but also its dominance atop the market-wide sales charts over the past several days, points to a rebirth for the Solana community. It\u2019s undoing the damage from the FTX associations and the narratives that formed as a result, in his view, along with the impact of DeGods and y00ts.\n\n\u201cIt's got a super organic NFT community that hasn't gone anywhere. I think that DeGods and y00ts kind of sucked the life out of the NFT space, but I think it's totally back now,\u201d Ferrante said. \u201cAnd it's not going anywhere. It's honestly more exciting than ever.\u201d"
