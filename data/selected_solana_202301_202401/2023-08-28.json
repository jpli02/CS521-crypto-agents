        "content": "MANIZALES, Colombia \u2014 A group of Colombian researchers had their \u201cspidey senses\u201d tingling during a recent expedition. They have discovered four new tarantula species in a largely uncharted \u201cbiodiversity hotspot\u201d in the Colombian Pacific region.\n\nThe Choc\u00f3 Biogeographic Region, rich in tropical rainforests and mangroves, not only attracts tourists but also holds the key to conserving its unique ecosystem.\n\nResearchers embarked on an expedition at the Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico del Pac\u00edfico (JBP) in Bah\u00eda Solano to study a group of spiders known as Mygalomorphae. This includes the likes of tarantulas, trapdoor spiders, and funnel-web spiders, among others. These spiders are primarily terrestrial, predatory, and often have a limited geographical presence.\n\nDuring their search, the team uncovered Ummidia solana, a unique trapdoor spider, and three tarantula species: Euthycaelus cunampia, Neischnocolus mecana, and Melloina pacifica.\n\n\u201cThese taxonomic breakthroughs represent the first recorded instances of their respective genera in the region, expanding their geographical distribution,\u201d the researchers report in a media release.\n\n\u201cEach species was meticulously illustrated, described, and scientifically discussed, offering valuable insights into their morphological characteristics, taxonomy, and biogeography. The results of this study serve as a significant contribution to our understanding of the region\u2019s biological diversity, known for its exceptional species richness and endemism.\u201d\n\nDelving deeper into their findings, researchers unveiled:\n\nUmmidia solana is named after Bah\u00eda Solano and marks the debut record of the Ummidia genus in the Choc\u00f3 Biogeographic Region.\n\n\n\nMelloina pacifica is the first-ever described species of the Melloina genus in Colombia. Its habitat, the Colombian Pacific region, inspired its name.\n\n\n\nEuthycaelus cunampia honors two Ember\u00e1 indigenous community members, Don Jos\u00e9 and Don Antonio, who shifted from hunting traditions to guiding tourists and scholars at the JBP. This discovery is significant, marking the first instance of the Euthycaelus genus and the subfamily Schismatothelinae outside specific Colombian regions.\n\n\n\nNeischnocolus mecana , named after a Bah\u00eda Solano township, is the fourth known species of its genus in Colombia and the first in the Choc\u00f3 region and the Colombian Pacific.\n\n\n\nThe group emphasized the need for more in-depth taxonomic research due to the vast undiscovered species that potentially exist in the region.\n\nThe study was published in the journal ZooKeys.\n\nYou might also be interested in:"

Market sentiments improved following optimistic remarks by JPMorgan analysts, which indicate a potential end to Bitcoin's downward trend and injected positivity into the market landscape. This view gains further credibility due to the declining open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, signalling the potential conclusion of prolonged liquidation processes. In contrast, Ethereum's current trading stands at roughly $1,650. The weekend also saw criticism from crypto Twitter following the US Treasury Department\u2019s new proposal on handling digital asset taxes.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cThe crypto market held steady over the weekend. As per CoinGecko, the global crypto market capitalisation is up 0.2 percent in the last 24 hours and continues to remain above $1 trillion. The crypto fear and greed index continues to be in the fear zone with a score of 39/100, a point up since yesterday. Crypto investors are cautious, even though downward price action seems to be slowing down.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, \u201cAmidst upcoming data on July\u2019s personal consumption expenditure, the market seems to have bounced back from the slump of the last few weeks. Potential interest rate hikes which could be determined over the next few days, could be a catalyst for price movements of key tokens. Altcoins haven\u2019t demonstrated any significant price movement to determine the onset of an alt season.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin recently crossed $26,000, sparking investment discussions. While its value has fallen slightly, concerns about the impending financial crisis and inflation remain. Economist Peter Schiff warns of a crisis before the US central bank controls inflation. Despite Bitcoin's prominent position, the US dollar still dominates global payments \u2014 SWIFT data confirms. Cardano's creator, Charles Hoskinson, predicts that it will outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum due to its unique features. However, the value of ADA continues to stagnate. Amidst the volatility, Bitcoin's technicals appear stable, trading between $25,500 and $27,000 with the potential to rise to $27,400 or even $28,650.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cIn the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, reveals a market in spirited motion. The past 24 hours witnessed a surge, painting a 15.95 percent increase in the total crypto market volume, a testament to its ever-shifting nature. Notably, the DeFi landscape contributed significantly, boasting a $1.58 billion volume, signifying 9.09 percent of the entire crypto market's 24-hour volume. This underscores the persistent growth and influence of decentralized finance. Amidst this panorama, Bitcoin stands strong at a price of $26,019.72, an anchor in the volatile sea of digital assets.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
