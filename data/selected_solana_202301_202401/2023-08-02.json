        "content": "Solana Price Analysis: The recent correction phase in Solana price found suitable support at $22.7. This horizontal level combined with the 50% Fibonacci replacement level, creates a strong demand zone for market participants. On July 26th, the coin price tried to bounce back from the aforementioned support with the morning star candle, but the buyers\u2019 failure to give a suitable follow-up indicates insufficient bullish momentum to resume price recovery.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Price Analysis: Here\u2019s How $22.7 Support Sets $SOL for 25% Rally\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana Price Daily Chart\n\nThe accumulation of several technical levels at $22.7 creates a high area of interest for market participants.\n\nThe Solana price trading above 100-and-200-day EMA reflects the overall trend that remains bullish.\n\nThe 24-hour trading volume on the Solana coin is $418.5 Million, indicating a 3.6% gain.\n\nSource-Tradingview\n\nBy the press time, the Solana price traded at $23.72 and showed a long rejection candle at $22.7 support. These two reversals from the same support within a fortnight indicate the presence of strong demand pressure.\n\nA potential reversal would lead to the formation of a bullish reversal pattern called the double bottom. This pattern is a sign of active accumulation from traders and the possibility of a sustained rally.\n\nIf the coin price gives a bullish breakout from the $25.75 resistance, the buyers would get a solid springboard to jump higher. The post-breakout rally could surge the prices 12.5% higher to hit $29, followed by $32.\n\nSolana Price Breakdown to $20?\n\nIn case the Solana price continues to waver above the $22.7 support without a sustained rebound, the strength of buyers to continue a recovery rally would be under question. A breakdown below $22.4 would accelerate the selling pressure and push the coin price to $20.\n\nExponential moving average: The 50-and-100- day EMA nearing a bullish crossover near $22.5 increasing the support strength of this level.\n\nRelative Strength Index : Despite the falling RSI slope , the coin price maintains a higher low formation indicating a reverse bullish divergence which favors the uptrend continuation"

        "title": "Low cost of Solana DeFi frees developers from constraints: Ellipsis co-founder - Blockworks",
        "content": "The 2020 vision for DeFi, according to Eugene Chen, was for a fully on-chain, transparent composable trading experience. \u201cWe still believe in this vision,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of others in crypto have kind of given up on it.\u201d\n\nThe co-founder of Ellipsis Labs says that \u201ccoming over to the Solana side\u201d has been a \u201cbreath of fresh air.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, all these super heavy constraints that are on you as a protocol developer are just gone. They\u2019re replaced with a different set of constraints, of course,\u201d he admits.\n\nChen talks to Blockworks on the 0XResearch podcast (Spotify/Apple) about how the vision for fully on-chain DeFi remains a strong possibility.\n\n\u201cWe are still quite early on the infrastructure side,\u201d Chen says, \u201cbut as a DeFi protocol designer, there\u2019s just so much more you can do when you don\u2019t have to deal with 10 or 20 [transactions per second].\u201d\n\nThe high throughput and low fees that are characteristic of Solana\u2019s ecosystem allow \u201cactive participation in the market,\u201d he says. Chen mentions Ellipsis Labs-developed Phoenix, a fully on-chain, non-custodial decentralized limit-order book, as an example. New limit-orders, cancellations and trades take place 5 to 10 times per second on the platform as of now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the very early stages here. So we expect that number to go up pretty significantly as the markets become more competitive and as more users come on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just not possible on a chain that does 10 or 20 [transactions per second],\u201d he says. \u201cYou are not going to have 10 [transactions per second] going through a single DEX, or if you are, the cost is going to be prohibitive.\u201d\n\nMarket makers on Phoenix update orders every second or faster, Chen says, paying around $20 per day in costs \u2014 \u201cwhich is like the cost of one \u2018add liquidity\u2019 or \u2018remove liquidity\u2019 on Uniswap V3.\u201d\n\nPrice discovery happens off-chain\n\nChen explains that DeFi automated market makers (AMMs) were born out of speed and cost constraints. \u201cYou don\u2019t need your market makers to be updating their quotes super frequently. You set it and forget it. And I think that really was quite innovative.\u201d\n\nBut the liquidity provided by AMMs is not competitive with off-chain limit-order books, according to Chen. This is why, he says, price discovery takes place off-chain on centralized exchanges.\n\n\u201cThe price discovery is happening on these venues that don\u2019t have 12 second block times, where market makers can put the liquidity exactly where they want to,\u201d he says.\n\nChen admits that on-chain DeFi has a long way to go. \u201cThere are a ton of concerns with MEV and discrete block times in the same way that these are pretty big challenges for AMMs to overcome.\u201d\n\nChen notes that the \u201cvanilla limit-order book\u201d implemented on Phoenix is not yet good enough to be the \u201cfinal form of DeFi liquidity,\u201d but is a \u201cmuch better starting point than the AMM.\u201d\n\nThe AMM design space is \u201cfairly restricted,\u201d according to Chen. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re on Ethereum mainnet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do expect to see a lot more innovation in DEX design as more and more DeFi activity on the Ethereum side moves to [layer-2s], and I\u2019m pretty excited to see that.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
