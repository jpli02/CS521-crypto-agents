        "title": "Mango Markets to Resume Crypto Trading, SEC Be Damned - CoinDesk",
        "content": "One possible issue stems from Mango Markets\u2019 $70 million token sale in August 2021. It claimed to ban U.S. investors from participating in that sale, a move which CoinDesk noted at the time was likely an attempt to avoid regulatory scrutiny. In spite of this self-imposed ban, the SEC\u2019s lawsuit claims U.S. investors \u2013 indeed some of Mango\u2019s creators who live in the U.S. \u2013 bought the token."

        "title": "Phantom Wallet Claims It Thwarted Over 18K Attacks - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter the latest high-profile NFT hack, this time taking down tech entrepreneur Kevin Rose, the security advantages of self-custody wallets were making the rounds on Crypto Twitter again.\n\nOn Wednesday, the creator of Proof and the Moonbirds NFT project was the victim of a phishing attack after the scammer sent Rose a message that leveraged permissions that he'd already granted to his MetaMask wallet on the OpenSea marketplace. When that message was signed, the thief used those privileges to drain over 40 NFTs, including an Autoglyphs NFT worth almost $500,000, from his wallet.\n\nA tweet responding to Rose pointed out that the popular Solana cryptocurrency, Phantom, had warned its users of a malicious website and blocked the website that had snared Rose. The wallet developer responded, \u201cwe got your back.\u201d\n\nLike MetaMask, Phantom has a browser and mobile app that users can use to purchase, buy, or send their favorite NFT collections.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe got your back \ud83e\udd1d https://t.co/8ZGPj4o2r6 \u2014 Phantom (@phantom) January 25, 2023\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always done certain forms of blocking\u2014initially manually through an open source blocklist, and then getting more automated and sophisticated over time,\u201d Francesco Agosti, Phantom co-founder and CTO, told Decrypt via direct message. \u201cYou need to keep up with scammers, who are coming up with new strategies all the time, to be effective.\u201d\n\nIn a blog post on Wednesday, Phantom addressed the issue of phishing and scams, saying that the wallet has scanned over 85 million transactions and blocked over 18,000 wallet-draining transactions.\n\nAgosti says Phantom uses manual and automated systems to keep its website blocklist up-to-date, and the company proactively blocks sites it finds suspicious characteristics.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAgosti acknowledged that the issue that hit Rose yesterday was that he signed a message, not a transaction. Phantom currently doesn\u2019t scan messages, but Agosti said the company is working on scanning them in a future release.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to change any settings; it\u2019s all on by default,\u201d he said. \u201cYou probably won\u2019t notice it when using safe dApps, but it activates when you visit a website or try to submit a transaction we think is malicious.\u201d\n\nPhishing is one of the most common forms of online attacks. These scams can come via email, social media, or text. On Wednesday, the Twitter account of the Robinhood exchange was compromised by hackers who launched a phishing attack impersonating the popular trading platform.\n\nRegardless of the method of transmission, phishing scams ask users to respond in some way, either by replying to a text message or clicking a link that connects the users to a malicious website. And while any device linked to the internet is a potential target, Agosti says the Phantom wallet comes ready.\n\n\u201cPhishing is pretty constant\u2014perhaps growing overall as more users enter the space and the opportunity becomes more attractive. In terms of actual scams\u2014that fluctuates. Usually, what happens is that things are fairly stable for a while, and then scammers discover a new strategy that works really well, and then the number of scams spikes as the ecosystem adapts to that new strategy. Kind of like an immune system,\u201d he said.\n\nDecrypt reached out to the creators of MetaMask, but has yet to receive a response."

Governments and authorities are recognizing the complexity and specific nature of the space and are moving towards the differentiated treatment of top market cap assets such as Bitcoin, NFTs and Defi tokens. A one-size-fits-all approach is not effective, a tailored and asset-specific approach is required to foster innovation and growth while ensuring regulations are appropriate.\"\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
