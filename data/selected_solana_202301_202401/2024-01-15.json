It is making a push for a spot among Solana's top memecoins, such as Bonk BONK/USD, dogwifhat and Myro.\n\nDubbed as \"the woman behind MYRO,\" the meme cryptocurrency has experienced a substantial inflow from crypto investors, as indicated by over $4.5 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nWhy It Matters: Myra's meteoric rise in value within a couple of days has positioned it as the potential next big thing in the world of Solana-based memecoins.\n\nIn contrast to other major dog coins like BONK and Myro, Myra is not yet listed on any centralized exchange (CEX).\n\nWith its current market capitalization at $2.1 million, a further rise in popularity of Myra may lead to its listing on centralized exchanges, potentially driving up its price even further.\n\nRead Also: WYNN Vs.

        "content": "Solana Beach\u2019s Kelli Pease has opened a charming new Little Free Library in Solana Beach, complete with free books and flower bouquets and fairy fortunes.\n\nAlong with a selection of great books for free, Pease gives away her homegrown floral arrangements as a way to meet her mission to give away one million flowers, which she hopes to achieve through the library and though supporting charities like Meals on Wheels.\n\nKelli and her husband Billy moved into their Solana Beach home just before the pandemic in 2020. There was space in the yard for a permanent garden so they took out the grass and patio to make room for seven garden beds.\n\n\u201cI really started to garden more seriously when we moved in,\u201d Pease said. \u201cMy grandmother, who also lives in Solana Beach, taught me how to garden. It\u2019s really fun to share that passion with her.\u201d\n\nGardening became her release during the pandemic. Pease found that she not only loved the process of growing flowers from seed but she also loved the idea of giving the flowers away as a way to spread happiness and healing. She started what she named the Flower Remedy, giving her bouquets away in all kinds of ways, from senior homes to, starting last year, Meals on Wheels.\n\nHer Flower Remedy has an accompanying website, newsletter and Instagram devoted to garden tips and floriography, the language of flowers. The only thing she sells is a Flowering Conversation Deck\u2014a set of 50 cards with watercolor paintings of different flowers by artist Tracy Truong. Each card has a conversation starter question on the back, picked with that specific flower\u2019s meaning in mind (forget me-not for remembrance, magnolia for wisdom, hyacinth for playfulness).\n\nA flower bouquet from Kelli Pease\u2019s garden. (Kelli Pease)\n\nShe takes a photo of every bouquet she makes in order to keep track of her million flower mission\u2014her goal is to eventually have a counter tallying up blooms on her website.\n\nAs much as Pease loves flowers, she loves books.\n\n\u201cI love reading all kinds of books, specifically newer contemporary fiction, but I love them all,\u201d said Pease.\n\nThere are a few Little Free Libraries in Solana Beach, including one down the street on North Rios Avenue and she used to take her books and the occasional bouquet there: \u201cBut I always really wanted our own that I could steward myself,\u201d she said.\n\nBilly, who is an artist, built the little white library from scratch with amenities such as a shelf for her flowers and a little blue fairy door on the bottom. When you open up the tiny door, there is a little fairy fortune to discover every week.\n\nThe library officially opened the Sunday after Thanksgiving. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really announce it to anyone, we just put it up and a lot of neighbors just happened to be outside,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was fun because everyone came and donated books right away and took a few.\u201d\n\nPease, who owns a learning management system company with her brother, is a Little Library librarian as a fun side project. She keeps a spreadsheet of which books are taken and when. She currently has a backlog of 50 donated books in the collection\u2014Books and Blooms always has at least two very popular books, children\u2019s books and newer fiction and thrillers (\u201cThrillers go the fastest\u201d). There is also a community art book in circulation, for kids and adults to put their art in to share with the neighborhood, as well as seed giveaways.\n\nFor the holidays, the little library was decorated with lights\u2014 soon it will have Valentine\u2019s Day decor and other surprises. Pease\u2019s flowers are placed on the library shelf whenever she has extras growing, with a framed sign that invites people to take a free bouquet for someone they love.\n\n\u201cWinter is a little slow growing in the garden,\u201d said Pease. She is nurturing some baby seedlings and soon in the spring she will have sweet peas, ranunculus, irises and daffodils. In the summer, there will be her almost perfect dahlias, along with the latest beach reads.\n\nFollow along on Instagram at booksandbloomsfreelibrary or visit floweremedy.co. The library\u2019s charter number is 179155 and can be found on the Little Free Library map on littlefreelibrary.org/\n\n"

        "title": "Forget Solana, This Cryptocurrency Is Poised for an Incredible Run in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Backed by game-changing upgrades and unparalleled utility, Ethereum holds immense long-term potential.\n\nAfter rising by more than 900% last year, Solana (SOL -0.53%) might be the most deserving to hold the title of crypto's 2023 MVP. Yet, while the digital currency's monumental resurgence provided a much-needed respite after it fell to as low as $8, Solana's long-term prospects pale in comparison to one of crypto's household names: Ethereum (ETH 0.88%).\n\nHere's why investors would be remiss to overlook Ethereum's potential while the market's focus remains elsewhere.\n\nA little context first\n\nIn 2015, Ethereum arrived on the crypto scene with a bang. At the time, it was the first blockchain that allowed developers to build custom decentralized applications via smart contracts -- transactions that self-executive when certain terms are met -- making Ethereum the first programmable cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum's pioneering of smart contracts meant that the majority of innovative crypto uses initially found a home on its blockchain. Things like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and much more all started on Ethereum and represented a seismic shift in the trajectory of crypto's capabilities.\n\nBut like any iteration of technology, new versions eventually arose. Enter Solana. Building off of Ethereum's efforts, Solana arrived in 2017 offering developers and users a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum.\n\nFast-forward a few years, and Solana has assumed the title of Ethereum killer, gaining significant traction in the crypto economy thanks to its blazing speeds and extremely low fees. Today, it is the fifth-most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market with a total valuation of $41 billion.\n\nSolana's rapid rise to become one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies has brought a wave of hype with it. Yet even with this, Ethereum remains nearly six times as valuable and supports 20 times more value across the DeFi economy.\n\nEthereum's game-changing upgrades\n\nWhile Solana optimists might paint a different picture, the reality is that Ethereum remains the epicenter of the decentralized economy. It has the largest developer community, has a proven track record of functionality, and continues to implement upgrades that will further increase the network's capabilities.\n\nMost importantly, these upgrades are part of the reason Ethereum is poised for a run in 2024. In the second half of the year, Ethereum will launch EIP-41844, an upgrade that will lower transaction fees and increase its throughput.\n\nFor the entirety of Solana's existence, its primary advantage was that it is a cheaper and faster version than Ethereum. But what will happen if Ethereum levels the playing field?\n\nWith increased efficiency and scalability, the number of uses Ethereum can support will likely increase. Since one of the primary ways a cryptocurrency is valued lies in the utility it provides, EIP-41844 could bring new value to Ethereum's long-term prospects.\n\nBest of all, though, EIP-41844 is just one of a series of planned upgrades over the coming years. Subsequent improvements will introduce new functionality such as greater security, increasing decentralization, and further streamlining of the network.\n\nIn totality, Ethereum's future upgrades hold the potential to solidify it as the most valuable smart-contract blockchain and squash any competition.\n\nThe multichain future\n\nLike many markets in the world today, the DeFi economy will likely have several competitors. Take the smartphone market as an example. While Androids make up more than 80% of the global market, Apple's iPhone still holds a considerable portion.\n\nA similar future in crypto is likely: one where Solana and Ethereum coexist, with each offering developers and users different options. However, when deciding which of the two is poised for a significant run, Ethereum looks more promising, especially over the long haul.\n\nWhile Solana ran up more than 900% in 2023, Ethereum witnessed a measly 90% jump. As the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market and home to more decentralized applications than any other blockchain, this lack of performance suggests that Ethereum has a bit of catching up to do.\n\nFortunately, Ethereum is no stranger to significant growth. During the last bull market, it rose by nearly 2,000% when it skyrocketed from around $200 to more than $4,800 over a year and a half. Whether a similar scenario unfolds remains to be seen.\n\nBut when considering the potential that will accompany EIP-41844, as well as future upgrades, don't be surprised if Ethereum becomes one of the best performers in your portfolio for years to come."
