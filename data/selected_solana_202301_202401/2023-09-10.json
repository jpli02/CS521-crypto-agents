While Ethereum continues to dominate this market segment, it is also worth keeping an eye out for newcomers like Solana and Cardano. At the same time low gas sidechains like BNB and Polygon have an important role to play in the Ethereum ecosystem. New rollups and layer 2 scaling solutions are just arriving on the market and it is also worth watching this space."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a market that is often swayed by sentiment, Ethereum and Solana find themselves in a complicated spot. Despite a string of bullish news, including Visa's interest and the buzz around a potential spot ETH ETF, both digital assets seem to be grappling with a shadow cast by fear-driven market dynamics. The looming $3 billion liquidation on FTX is a case in point, steering the market's focus away from the positive strides these blockchains are making.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum is priced at $1,623.49 USD, while Solana stands at $18.47 USD. These figures might not tell the whole story, but they do hint at a subdued market response to what should have been uplifting news.\n\nOver the past two weeks, both Ethereum and Solana have shown less than stellar price performance. This lackluster movement contradicts the positive news flow and suggests that the market is more attuned to potential risks, such as FTX's impending liquidation, rather than opportunities. It's as if the market has put on blinders, focusing solely on the pitfalls ahead.\n\nSo, what's the takeaway? Well, it is not that Ethereum and Solana lack promise; far from it. These platforms continue to innovate and attract institutional interest. However, the market seems to be in a state of selective hearing, tuning in only to news that feeds its anxieties. This restive behavior could be a temporary phase, but for now, it is dictating the tempo of the market.\n\nAs for now, the market needs to recalibrate its focus, shedding its tunnel vision to appreciate the broader landscape of possibilities that these blockchains offer. Until then, ETH and SOL will likely continue to dance in the shadows."

        "title": "TMS Network (TMSN) Shatters Expectations with a Staggering Token Price Surge, Dimming Cardano (ADA) and ... - ChainBits",
        "content": "Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) were two of the most prominent projects of the crypto bull market cycle, but the market is in for a huge shakeup this time around. TMS Network (TMSN) is in the second phase of its token presale at the perfect time, as it appears a new bull market is here. This is illustrated by the success of the TMS Network (TMSN) presale up to this point, as it\u2019s already raised over $4 million.\n\nTMS Network (TMSN)\n\nOne of the issues that has held back the proliferation of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) has been the lack of advanced trading tools on these platforms. But now, this is destined to change thanks to TMS Network (TMSN). By combining the decentralization of a DEX with the traditional tools advanced traders are used to seeing on more centralized platforms, TMS Network (TMSN) has the potential to completely revamp the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.\n\nWhile there are many different features that could be added to the DEX industry, a key one for TMS Network (TMSN) is social trading. This feature allows novice traders to learn from those who are already trading crypto profitably and also enables new users to start using TMS Network (TMSN) by copying the trades of more knowledgeable users. Notably, TMS Network (TMSN) also goes far beyond the crypto market, allowing users to trade traditional assets too.\n\nAnother feature found with TMS Network (TMSN) that is shockingly rare in the DEX space is that holders of TMS Network (TMSN) tokens will actually earn a share of the revenue that is earned by the trading platform. Token holders will also have standard perks like dedicated customer support and governance rights on the platform.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nDjed (DJED), a decentralized and algorithmic stablecoin that runs on the Cardano (ADA) blockchain, has reached a new milestone by surpassing 4 million tokens in circulation. Djed is designed to maintain a stable peg to the US dollar by using a combination of collateral and a reserve token. The collateral is provided by Cardano\u2019s (ADA) native token, while the reserve token is called SHEN.\n\nDjed has a high level of security and stability, as it is overcollateralized by 380% Cardano (ADA), meaning that for every Djed token issued, there are almost four times as many Cardano (ADA) tokens backing it. The current circulating supply of Djed is supported by about 38.9 million Cardano (ADA) tokens. The reserve token, SHEN, plays a key role in ensuring the price stability of Djed, as it allows users to buy and sell SHEN to adjust the supply and demand of Djed.\n\nDjed was created by IOG, the company behind Cardano\u2019s (ADA) development, and COTI Group, a blockchain payments ecosystem. It was announced in September 2021 and launched earlier this year.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nThe Helium Network, a decentralized wireless network powered by blockchain and IoT devices, is undergoing a major upgrade. The network will switch from its own layer-1 blockchain to the Solana (SOL) blockchain on April 18, 2023, at 9 am PST. This move to Solana (SOL) was approved by the community through a proposal called HIP 70 \u2013 Scaling the Helium Network.\n\nThe transition to Solana (SOL) will bring many benefits for the Helium Network, such as higher scalability, lower Solana (SOL) transaction costs, and faster performance. Solana\u2019s (SOL) energy-efficient consensus mechanism and high transaction throughput will enable the Helium Network to support more devices and applications that require reliable and secure wireless connectivity. The upgrade to Solana (SOL) will also allow for enhanced network robustness.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are well-known in the crypto community, TMS Network (TMSN) could be a better investment. Not only is TMS Network (TMSN) aiming to help its investors profit more from their trades, the TMS Network (TMSN) is currently in its presale, which means investors will likely get a great price for the tokens. Tokens are currently selling for $0.085 per token during the second stage of TMS Network\u2019s (TMSN) presale event.\n\n\n\nFind out more about investing in the TMS Network (TMSN) here:\n\nPresale: https://presale.tmsnetwork.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://tmsnetwork.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nWebsite: https://tmsnetwork.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tmsnetworkio\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/njA95e7au6\n\nChainbits is not the source of this content.
