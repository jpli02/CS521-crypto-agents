        "title": "Solana Leaves Ethereum In The Dust As Institutional Inflows Rise | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Solana is making its mark once again as the majority of cryptocurrencies turn green in terms of their price movement, crypto investment products have finally seen a net inflow of capital for the first time in the past six weeks.\n\nAccording to the new CoinShares report, most of this inflow is attributed to Bitcoin, as the majority of the altcoin market registered outflows last week. But as Bitcoin starts to regain inflow momentum, Solana has continued to shine, trumping altcoin investment products with inflows of $5 million.\n\nSolana Digital Investment Products Leaves Ethereum In The Dust\n\nSolana has been on an epic run this year and has done better than most altcoins in terms of interest from institutional investors. The crypto continues to reiterate its climbing position among investors with 27 weeks of inflows and just 4 weeks of outflows this year. But while altcoins like Solana and XRP have also had inflows in recent weeks, Ethereum, in particular, has struggled to gain momentum from institutions.\n\nCoinShares\u2019 data reveals investor interest in Ethereum is rather low. Although Ethereum is still the dominant platform for DeFi and smart contracts, its investment products registered outflows of $1.5 million last week, taking its trend of outflows for the 6th consecutive week.\n\nOther altcoins like Litecoin, XRP, and Tron had no net inflows/outflows, but short Bitcoin and Multi-asset investment products also registered outflows of $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\n\nSOL price holds above $24 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFactors Influencing The Inflow\n\nThe report from Coinshares attributes the inflows into Bitcoin to a reaction to a combination of positive price momentum and fears over US government debt prices, considering most of the inflow came in late in the week. Amid these influences, Solana has seen growth in other aspects of its ecosystem that may have attracted institutional investors.\n\nFor one, Solana has had one of the best TVL performances in recent months, overtaking Ethereum in terms of growth. Data from DefiLlama shows Solana\u2019s total value locked just reached a new high from the year at $336.77 million. This represents a growth of 64% from its $205.11 million TVL at the beginning of the year.\n\nData from Coinmarketcap shows Solana has benefited the most from the ongoing bullish momentum in the wider crypto market. As a result, Solana managed to overtake Dogecoin and Cardano to become the seventh-largest crypto by market cap.\n\nAt the time of writing, Solana has increased by 24.13% in a 7-day timeframe. Solana\u2019s current price action is approaching resistance at $24.5, which could force another downside correction.\n\nFeatured image from Guarda Wallet, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "Solana (SOL) has emerged as a standout performer in the recent crypto market rally, catching the attention of investors and analysts alike. The entire cryptocurrency market has been on a bullish streak, with most digital assets turning green on the charts. However, Solana has managed to stand out by achieving an unprecedented increase in its price.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL was trading at $23.54 on CoinGecko and boasted a market capitalization near $10 billion. While the coin did register a 1.6% loss in the past 24 hours, its seven-day surge of 22% indicated its resilience and potential for further growth.\n\nIn fact, this remarkable price uptrend enabled Solana to surpass both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA), securing its position as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCrypto Era Looms: BIS Innovations Chief Calls On Central Banks To Prepare 7 months ago\n\nSolana\u2019s Growth Drivers\n\nOne key factor behind Solana\u2019s surge was its impressive 100%+ increase in 24-hour trading volume, providing robust support for its price appreciation. Additionally, Solana\u2019s performance within the decentralized finance sector also experienced notable growth during this period.\n\nThe positive sentiment surrounding Solana was further evidenced by data from LunarCrush, which indicated a nearly 47% surge in SOL\u2019s social engagement over the last seven days. Investors and enthusiasts were increasingly drawn to the coin as its price continued to rise.\n\nGearing Up For A Bull Market\n\nPseudonymous analyst Inmortal, active on the social media platform X, expressed optimism about Solana\u2019s potential. Inmortal believes that Solana presents a significant opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate the cryptocurrency at a point of maximum potential.\n\nIn two years you will realize that everything was as simple as buying $SOL below $20 and wait. But you were too scared because FTX was going to dump their coins. \u2014 Inmortal (@inmortalcrypto) September 20, 2023\n\nAccording to Inmortal, those who accumulate SOL at its current price point are likely to be handsomely rewarded in the coming years. In a statement, Inmortal said, \u201cIn two years, you will realize that everything was as simple as buying SOL below $20 and waiting. But you were too scared because FTX was going to dump their coins.\u201d\n\nSOL market cap approaches the $10 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nConcerns had arisen when court documents revealed that FTX owns approximately $1.16 billion worth of SOL. This led many traders to speculate that Solana\u2019s price might face downward pressure if FTX were to liquidate its holdings.\n\nHowever, notable investor Chris Burniske pointed out that only a fraction of FTX\u2019s SOL holdings are actually liquid, stating, \u201cOnly ~13% of FTX\u2019s SOL holdings are liquid\u2026 Keep a cool head, folks.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAs Solana continues to gain traction in the crypto market, investors are closely watching its performance, with many betting on the coin\u2019s long-term potential and the possibility of significant rewards for those who enter the market now.\n\nThe recent surge in Solana\u2019s price and its positive developments in the DeFi space have solidified its position as a cryptocurrency to watch.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.
