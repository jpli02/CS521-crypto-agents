        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Tuesday, with altcoin falling sharply. Chaos is looming in the market on the back of pessimistic news flow. Also, lack of macroeconomic events is unable to support the movement in the digital token market.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in the red zone on Tuesday as the largest crypto token dropped about 2 per cent and breached below 29,000-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum also posted similar declines, falling more than 2 per cent and it slipped below $1,850-levels. Altcoins were mostly bleeding.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has undergone some selling pressure in the last 24 hours. Contrastingly, the crypto fear and greed index has climbed 3 points since yesterday and continues to remain in the neutral zone with a score of 53/100, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to make new lows in the daily chart as it traded at its lowest price in 40 days in the early trading hours for the day. From a purely technical analysis lens, not a lot of downside remains in it if the bullish trend line were to be respected and we could see a reversal from the trend line support which sits at around $27,000 for the day,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading lower on Tuesday. Bitcoin Cash dropped more than 5 per cent, while Solana and Polygon declined about 5 per cent each. Cardano and Litecoin tumbled 4 per cent each. Polkadot, Dogecoin, Tron and XRP shed 3 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply lower, falling down to $1.16 trillion-mark as it dropped more than 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged about 17 per cent to $30.15 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market is currently in a consolidation phase, with Bitcoin trading in a narrow range. This is likely due to a lack of major macroeconomic news, which has made it difficult for investors to make directional bets, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nStormX (STMX) stands out as a pioneering global cryptocurrency-based solution that has successfully expanded its reach to worldwide markets. Functioning as both a mobile app and browser extension, StormX's primary objective is to provide users with cryptocurrency cashback for the majority of their online purchases.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-Storm\n\n\n\nOn the weekly timeframe, the CLV/USDT trend has broken out of the descending channel pattern and is now retesting the upper trendline levels. The weekly RSI is nearly at its highest level since August of 2021 . The next resistance is expected at $0.0093 and an immediate support is expected at $0.0051 levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "What Is SOL? - LCX",
        "content": "What makes Solana unique?\n\nWhen Bitcoin was invented more than a decade ago, it solved a really tricky problem: how to make it possible for strangers anywhere in the world to make financial transactions over the internet without a payment processor like Visa or PayPal in the middle.\n\nThe technology that makes decentralized transactions possible \u2014 and which created the whole universe of cryptocurrencies we now know \u2014 is called a blockchain. But blockchains typically have one major downside compared to centralized networks like the ones credit-card companies use: they\u2019re slow. As of August 2021, Ethereum typically processes fewer than 15 transactions per second, compared to tens of thousands for Visa\u2019s network.\n\nSolana is one of many new crypto solutions aiming to make crypto networks faster and more scalable. It uses a suite of clever technologies, including a novel mechanism called \u201cproof of history.\u201d\n\nWho Created Solana (SOL)?\n\nSolana was first conceptualized by Anatoly Yakovenko in 2017, who sought a decentralized network of nodes that could match the performance of a single node. The Solana blockchain is guided by Solana Labs as a core contributor, while also being supported by the Solana Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit dedicated to growing the community and funding development.\n\nYakovenko and his team began receiving funds in 2018 as part of Solana Labs. The team privately raised over $20 million in a Series A that spanned several months into 2019. After its mainnet launch in March 2020, Solana raised an additional $1.76 million in a public token sale carried out by cryptocurrency auction.\n\nHow Does Solana Work?\n\nThe Solana network offers many features common to other cryptocurrency networks such as smart contracting, transaction settlement, and token issuance. However, to distinguish itself from others, Solana hopes to offer better settlement speeds and a higher capacity for transactions.\n\nSolana Network Architecture\n\nSolana aims to achieve scalability through it\u2019s network design and operates with eight core components to do so:\n\nProof-of-History \u2013 Global clock referenced to create a common schedule across all participants.\n\nGulf Stream \u2013 Defines when and how transactions are exchanged.\n\nSealevel \u2013 Processing engine that assigns the order and execution of transactions.\n\nTurbine \u2013 Defines how nodes validate transactions (also known as validators) send and receive blocks.\n\nCloudbreak \u2013 Memory mechanism used to keep track of participant balances\n\nPipeline \u2013 Verifies each component of a transaction.\n\nArchivers \u2013 Network of nodes where data is off-loaded from validators and stored in perpetuity.\n\nWhile technologically complex and intricate, each component is meant to optimize the amount of transactions Solana can execute without sharding its chain or using a layer 2 network.\n\nSolana Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus\n\nTo secure its blockchain, Solana created a consensus mechanism called Tower BFT that incorporates what is commonly referred to as delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS).\n\nDPoS uses a voting and reputation system to secure the network, validate transactions, and distribute newly minted SOL, meaning that anyone who owns SOL tokens (sometimes referred to as SOL coins) can help operate the network.\n\nEach SOL token can be locked, or \u201cstaked,\u201d by participants (\u201cnodes\u201d) to both participate in governance and increase the chances of being chosen to produce blocks.\n\nParticipants can also choose to delegate their SOL to other validators, allocating votes to them while earning a portion of the block rewards.\n\nWhy Does SOL Coin Have Value?\n\nThe SOL cryptocurrency plays a key role in maintaining and operating the Solana ecosystem.\n\nSolana rewards validators and delegators with a portion of the newly minted SOL along with transaction fees based on the amount of SOL staked, the set inflation rate, and the complexity and amount of transactions on the network.\n\nBy owning SOL tokens, users can also access the suite of projects that have been built on the Solana network.\n\nSimilar to Ethereum, Solana enables developers to run custom smart contracts and design decentralized applications (dapps) to offer digitized products and services. Examples include Serum, an order-book style decentralized exchange service, and Raydium, an automated market maker (AMM) that provides liquidity to its ecosystem.\n\nWhy Use Solana (SOL)?\n\nUsers may find Solana appealing based on its attempt to create a scalable platform for decentralized applications without implementing sharding or second-layer technologies.\n\nFurther, developers may find the platform attractive for products and services that warrant a high volume of activity. Investors may seek to buy SOL and add it to their portfolio if they believe the market will one day favor more scalable blockchains.\n\nWhere Can You Buy SOL?\n\nYou can buy, trade, and deposit XRP tokens at the LCX exchange. The trading pairs for XRP tokens are: SOL/EUR & SOL/LCX"
