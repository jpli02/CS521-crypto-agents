        "content": "Three primary sectors are driving the development of Solana\u2019s (SOL) \u201cvibrant\u201d ecosystem, according to the Hong Kong-based crypto exchange CoinEx Global.\n\nCoinEx notes in a new analysis that the Ethereum (ETH) competitor\u2019s attention is focused on decentralized finance (DeFi), memecoins and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (dePIN).\n\nDePIN projects involve crypto-powered decentralized networks that connect hardware devices and offer digital services, according to the crypto exchange Bitstamp.\n\nCoinEx notes that dePIN projects represent the highest total market cap on Solana.\n\n\u201cBenefiting from Solana\u2019s state compression technology, dePIN projects can significantly reduce the cost of minting NFTs (non-fungible tokens) representing real-world hardware (multiple NFTs can be minted for just $0.01). Therefore, Solana is the preferred ecosystem for many dePIN projects.\u201d\n\nCoinEx notes that the Solana ecosystem\u2019s top memecoin is Dogecoin (DOGE) rival Bonk (BONK). Last week, top crypto exchange Binance launched a BONK perpetual contract with up to 50x leverage. The 179th-ranked crypto asset is trading at $0.000004 at time of writing and is down nearly 10% in the past 24 hours.\n\nCoinEx also says the Pyth Network (PYTH), an oracle network, is the Solana ecosystem\u2019s \u201cmost prominent\u201d DeFi project. Binance also recently listed a PYTH perpetual contract with up to 50x leverage. The 80th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $0.432 at time of writing and is up over 1% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSolana\u2019s native asset, SOL, is trading at $55.02 at time of writing. The seventh-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down 2.82% in the past 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Code, a Solana-based crypto wallet, has fully open-sourced its code.\n\nThis move will make Code one of the first Solana-based applications to completely open-source its application using the MIT License.\n\nThe MIT License enables users to copy software code and its associated files \u201cas is,\u201d meaning that anyone can now use, copy, modify and distribute Code\u2019s software without limitation.\n\nTanner Philp, the chief operating officer of Code, told Blockworks in an interview that the MIT license is one of the most permissive licenses today.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin code base is also an MIT license, so adhering to Satoshi\u2019s vision, it is the most permissive and open license, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going with,\u201d Philp said.\n\nPhilp notes that the team at Code subscribes heavily to Satoshi\u2019s vision of creating a truly peer-to-peer electronic cash system, enabling anyone to validate and build upon the infrastructure itself.\n\nRead more: DYdX steps closer to v4 by open-sourcing code\n\nTraditionally, many apps built on the Solana blockchain have been built privately, with very few projects choosing to open-source their software.\n\nThis is likely because the Solana blockchain attracts many developers who have built consumer products in Web2, Philp notes.\n\n\u201cA lot of these developers land in the Solana ecosystem because it\u2019s the most performant chain and gives you the best opportunity to build slick consumer experiences, but from an engineering culture perspective, that means a lot of people are coming from Web2, where open source is not usually the norm,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: Solana \u2018roast\u2019 reveals painful truths\n\nPhilp adds that this move to open-source Code is important for the Solana ecosystem as a whole, as it can allow the network to take on more of a leadership position. He also notes that open-sourcing software tools show conviction in the tooling that has been built.\n\nCode CEO Ted Livingston\n\nThe Code team was founded by the team behind the Canadian messaging app, Kik. After struggling to find an appropriate business model to sustain its operations at Kik, the team launched its own cryptocurrency, Kin (KIN).\n\nOn the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple/YouTube), Code CEO Ted Livingston discusses Code\u2019s announcement and crypto\u2019s micropayments opportunity.\n\nKIN was used to raise an initial coin offering (ICO) totaling $100 million for Kik, but after being fined $5 million by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Kik \u2014 now under new ownership \u2014 is no longer associated with KIN.\n\nUpdated Nov. 28, 2023 at 10:40 am ET: Included photo of Code CEO Ted Livingston.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
