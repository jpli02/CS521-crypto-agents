        "content": "Today the Solana Foundation unveiled a set of token extensions that aim to add out-of-the-box blockchain functionality that would appeal to enterprises. Rather than having to write a custom smart contract for a token such as a bond, it\u2019s possible to select modular token extensions to support functionality such as compliance, confidentiality and even interest on the public blockchain.\n\n\u201cThe Solana network is the blockchain of choice for enterprise-grade companies looking to enter the web3 space,\u201d said Sheraz Shere, Head of Payments at the Solana Foundation.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Visa, Worldpay, Stripe, Google, and Shopify have already seen the performance advantages inherent to the Solana network and have launched solutions and applications that are only possible on Solana. With token extensions, we are expanding what is possible for enterprise adoption of blockchain by natively enabling features that matter to large regulated enterprises.\u201d\n\nTwo stablecoin providers already using token extensions are Paxos and Japan\u2019s GMO-Z. Both are New York-licensed trust companies. We previously reported the Paxos launch on Solana, and GMO-Z has issued its ZUSD and GYEN on the blockchain.\n\nSolana token extensions\n\nOne of the Solana token extensions is a \u2018transfer hook\u2019, allowing the creator to add functionality at the point of transfer. For example, it might check that the token recipient is on a KYC-allow list. As mentioned there\u2019s an interest bearing extension to attach a rate of interest to the token.\n\nOne of the more curious extensions was the one for confidentiality. It uses zero-knowledge proofs to hide the transfer amount but not the other details. One of the use cases mentioned is for payroll, and it would certainly help enterprise applications. However, we can think of quite a few applications where you might also want identities to be hidden. Consider a supply chain where a supplier may not want their up-chain suppliers to be visible. Otherwise, their customers can see who they work with.\n\nSolana is the latest to target enterprises, though its approach is different from others. Public blockchains popular with enterprises include Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Provenance, Hedera, Polkadot, Ripple and Algorand. Polygon, Avalanche and Polkadot essentially support private blockchains that can be linked to the public networks."

        "content": "The NFT marketplace Magic Eden is building out a user rewards program based around the so-called diamonds it rolled out in 2023. The platform said it would retroactively disburse diamonds to \u201cSolana OGs\u201d on Feb. 2.\n\nMagic Eden announced its decision to open-source its protocol code and grant governance rights to the newly-formed Non-Fungible DAO, to which it contributes. This move is yet another example of a project using non-trading \u201cpoints\u201d to motivate user behavior amidst increased regulatory scrutiny in the crypto industry.\n\nRead more: Treasury\u2019s Wally Adeyemo: My agency needs more power to regulate crypto \u2018\n\nMagic Eden debuted diamonds in March 2023, offering users rewards like lower fees and access to whitelists via the tokens. Now, Magic Eden users can earn diamonds by buying, selling or making offers to an entire collection of NFTs. Users can boost their rewards by relying exclusively on Magic Eden for their NFT trading.\n\nSome have expressed frustration at the ambiguity surrounding the usefulness of diamonds, which are not apparently tradable.\n\nThe scheme resonates with a larger movement in crypto toward systems where users accumulate non-trading points, as opposed to tokens, for their participation in a project. The SocialFi upstart friend.tech employed a points program to incentivize usage, and the Solana-based exchange Drift announced Drift Points this week.\n\nPoints tend to be winkingly thought of as a placeholder for a future token while projects iron out a spotty relationship between crypto and US regulators.\n\n\u201cGod bless all the crypto founders trying points. It\u2019s the box regulators have put us in, and we are just dealing with it and trying to figure out how to innovate with our hands tied behind our back,\u201d Unstoppable Domains founder Matthew Gould wrote on X this week.\n\nRead more: Lufthansa to offer NFT rewards program\n\nMagic Eden did not immediately return a request for comment on how it conceptualizes diamonds relative to points. In a post on X, the platform wrote: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just another points campaign. It\u2019s a meticulously crafted plan to give back to Magic Eden\u2019s OGs, collectors, creators and degens alike.\u201d\n\nConcurrently with the diamonds airdrop, the just-announced Non-Fungible DAO, which now owns and governs the smart contracts behind Magic Eden, has announced a token. The DAO implied that community members will be able to accrue the future token by interacting with Magic Eden.\n\nDetails on the new DAO are sparse, but a press release reviewed by Blockworks said Magic Eden had \u201cpledged to contribute\u201d to the DAO to \u201cfurther support industry growth.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Token extensions provide businesses with many of the same security and compliance controls as permissioned blockchain environments, with massively reduced engineering time, all while operating on one of the world's most popular public blockchains. These solutions represent another major advancement in developer tools on the Solana network contributing to the growth and health of the ecosystem and overall developer experience.\n\n\"Token extensions build on the characteristics that make Solana the ideal destination for developers,\" said Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana and CEO of Solana Labs. \"Solana is the first network to offer this level of integrated developer and user experience in a single token program. We're already seeing the potential to build using token extensions via deployments from some of the most recognizable names in crypto.\"\n\nAt the forefront of this launch are recognizable industry leaders like Paxos and GMO-Z.com Trust Company Inc. (GMO Trust) \u2013 companies that are leveraging the benefits of token extensions to issue stablecoins on the Solana blockchain. Paxos, a leading regulated blockchain and tokenization infrastructure platform, recently expanded its stablecoin issuance to Solana on December 22. Additionally, GMO Trust announced the first regulated Japanese yen stablecoin as well as their own U.S. dollar stablecoin on the Solana network. Token extensions provided the tools and optionality needed for companies like Paxos and GMO Trust to be at the forefront of innovation, while also remaining compliant.\n\n\"The Solana network is the blockchain of choice for enterprise-grade companies looking to enter the web3 space,\" said Sheraz Shere, Head of Payments at the Solana Foundation. \"Companies like Visa, Worldpay, Stripe, Google, and Shopify have already seen the performance advantages inherent to the Solana network and have launched solutions and applications that are only possible on Solana.

Extensions like transfer hooks, confidential transfers, and permanent delegates streamline compliance obligations and ensure that companies don't spend resources customizing smart contracts to implement their compliance frameworks.\"\n\nToken extensions were designed specifically to cater to builders across various industries, including stablecoins, real-world assets (RWA), and payments. The extensions include:\n\nTransfer hooks , which give token issuers control over how tokens and users interact, allowing a flexible design that empowers developers to build elaborate token interactions.\n\n, which give token issuers control over how tokens and users interact, allowing a flexible design that empowers developers to build elaborate token interactions.
