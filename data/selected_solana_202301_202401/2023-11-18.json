        "content": "Solana whales unstaked a large amount of SOL.\n\nPanic around potential dump grew, as the price fell. However, sentiment around SOL remained positive.\n\nOn 12th November, Whale Alert flagged two big Solana [SOL] transactions, each over $30 million. The first one sent 325,222 SOL, worth more than $18.6 million, to the Binance exchange.\n\nIt appeared that the interest in SOL was slowly starting to die down.\n\nWhales make a sudden move\n\nAccording to lookonchain\u2019s data, a big Solana holder withdrew 505,034 SOL, sending most to Binance and Kraken.\n\nAnother whale unstaked 2.16 million SOL, moving 1.3 million SOL worth $77 million out. Of this, 312,868 SOL landed in Binance and Kraken.\n\nPrice takes a hit\n\nLarge withdrawals by whales may create selling pressure on SOL, potentially causing a drop in its price. The movement of significant amounts to exchanges could signal intentions to sell, impacting market sentiment and leading to increased volatility in SOL\u2019s value.\n\nAdditionally, if more large holders follow suit, it might contribute to a broader market correction.\n\nThe reception around these movements has largely been negative, with many market participants anticipating a dump. The price of SOL fell by 12.66% in the last 24 hours. However, the decline in price wasn\u2019t enough to establish a bearish trend.\n\nOn the social front, the social volume around Solana spiked. This showed that people were talking a lot about Solana on social media networks.\n\nThe weighted sentiment around Solana also remained high, implying that despite the correction, the overall outlook of people on social media towards Solana remained positive.\n\nThe positive social media sentiment could help SOL retain its current levels in the future. Another major factor that could play a role in SOL maintaining its momentum, would be the state of its protocol.\n\nAfter looking at token terminal\u2019s data, it was seen that the Solana protocol was doing well.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nThe number of active users on the network has grown by 161% in the last month. Moreover, the revenue generated by Solana has also increased.\n\nThe performance of Solana\u2019s network could aid Solana\u2019s price going forward."

        "title": "Solana Price Prediction As Market Uncertainty Hints a Fall Below $50 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Solana Price Prediction: The recent recovery in Solana (SOL) has shown signs of decelerating momentum as the coin reached a 15-month high of $68. This overhead supply pressure is likely triggered by the broader market uncertainty as Bitcoin grapples with a $38,000 mark. Has SOL price hit the overbought region at $68 or there\u2019s more in the recovery trend?\n\nAlso Read: Solana Price Rally Captures Institutional Investor Attention, Can This Interest Thrust SOL To $100?\n\nadvertisement\n\nA Minor Correction Needed for the Next Leap\n\nThe rising channel pattern leads the ongoing uptrend in SOL price\n\nThe SOL price correction may find suitable support of $48.3 and $43.\n\nThe 24-hour trading volume on the Solana coin is $2.37 Billion, indicating a 1.3% loss.\n\nSource-Tradingview\n\nThe Solana coin price entered recovery mode in September when the price rebounded from the $17.78 low. This impressive parabolic recovery led to a 293% increase in price over just 10 weeks, peaking at $68.2.\n\nDuring this period, SOL buyers successfully reclaimed the daily Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at the 20, 50, 100, and 200 levels, and surpassed crucial price levels at $30 and, more recently, $48. However, after reaching an 18-month high of $68.2, SOL experienced a pullback to $76.9.\n\nThis correction may be a retest of the $48.3 support level, which aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. As long as SOL maintains above the 50% retracement level, currently at $43, the bullish sentiment surrounding Solana coin remains strong.\n\nThus, the post-correction rally may assist buyers to continue a bullish trajectory and resume the path of rounding bottom recovery. With respect to this pattern, the SOL price can find its potential target at $78.2 followed by $100, and $143.\n\nSpike in New Address Creation\n\nThe daily creation of new Solana addresses is a key indicator of network activity and potential growth. From September 17th to November 17th, the number of new addresses grew from 193.94K to 336.03K, indicating increasing participation and interest in the Solana network. This surge in new addresses typically signals rising demand for SOL and broader adoption of the network.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The upward slope of the 20-day EMA could provide substantial support during a potential pullback in the SOL price.\n\nAverage Directional Index (ADX): Currently at a high of 74%, the ADX indicates a likelihood of exhausted bullish momentum, suggesting that a corrective phase might be necessary for SOL."

        "title": "The Hives at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, CA - Loud Hailer Magazine",
        "content": "The Hives rocked the Belly Up Tavern with an unrelenting garage rock attack, supported by Kate Clover\u2019s electrifying opening set.\n\nIn a sonic storm that swept through the intimate confines of the Belly Up Tavern, Swedish garage-rock maestros The Hives delivered a relentless performance that left the audience in the tiny club wrapt and at the edge of exhilaration. Supported by the equally dynamic Kate Clover, the night unfolded as an ear-shattering testament to the enduring power of raw, unbridled rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\n\nKate Clover, a rising force in the alternative rock scene, set the stage ablaze with her opening act. The sharply dressed quartet with frontwoman, Clover, commanded the spotlight with a blend of punk-infused riffs and a magnetic stage presence, wasted no time breaking the ice, and went hard wire-to-wire from the opening note to the last instrument-dropping note. Her raspy vocals cut through the air like a serrated blade, adding an extra edge to her guitar-driven melodies. With tracks like \u201cChannel Zero\u201d and \u201cLove You to Death,\u201d Clover\u2019s set served as a fitting prelude to the high-octane sonic assault that was about to unfold.\n\nAs The Hives took the stage, they left no doubt as to why they were there. This tour is in support of their new album The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons. From the opening notes of \u201cBogus Operandi,\u201d The Hives put the hammer down and did not let off the gas until the final notes of the \u201cTick Tick Boom.\u201d Decked out in their traditional black-and-white attire, only now with custom glow-in-the-dark trim, the band launched into their set with the precision of a well-oiled machine. Frontman Howlin\u2019 Pelle Almqvist, a charismatic dynamo, led the charge with his electrifying stage presence, engaging the audience with a combination of swagger and infectious energy.\n\nThe setlist, a carefully curated selection of classics and newer material, showcased The Hives\u2019 ability to craft anthems that resonate across generations. \u201cHate To Say I Told You So\u201d and \u201cTick Tick Boom\u201d elicited raucous singalongs, while tracks from their latest album demonstrated that the band hasn\u2019t lost an ounce of their edge over the years. The seamless transitions between songs kept the momentum at a fever pitch, creating a sonic rollercoaster that had the crowd in a perpetual state of frenzy. The one-hour set seemingly the perfect amount of time to release a frenzy of energy without wearing out the audience.\n\nGuitarists Nicholaus Arson and Vigilante Carlstroem unleashed a barrage of fast and furious riffs, their guitars serving as a unified sonic weapon that punctuated each song with a staccato ferocious intensity. The rhythm section, comprised of bassist Chris Dangerous and drummer Chris Dangerous, laid down a foundation of pulsating beats that reverberated through the venue, ensuring that the audience was engulfed in a sonic onslaught from every angle in the intimate confines of the Belly Up.\n\nWhat set this performance apart was the band\u2019s ability to establish an intimate connection with the audience. Almqvist\u2019s banter between songs felt like a conversation with old friends, infusing the set with a sense of camaraderie and unbridled joy. As if you were at the neighborhood Friday night keg party. The intimacy Pelle and the band created transcended the typical performer-audience dynamic. The charismatic frontman\u2019s interactions were both humorous and heartfelt, adding a personal touch to the sonic spectacle. The show gave a vibe of as if you were at a friend\u2019s garage or backyard party.\n\nThe lighting design, a mesmerizing dance of strobe and shadows, enhanced the overall experience. As the stark white stage lights pulsated in sync with the music, the atmosphere became charged with an electric energy that mirrored the band\u2019s fervor. The intimate setting of the Belly Up Tavern amplified this sensory immersion, creating an unforgettable sonic landscape that enveloped the audience.\n\nThe Hives\u2019 performance at the Belly Up Tavern, supported by the electrifying Kate Clover, was nothing short of a stripped-down rock \u2018n\u2019 roll revival. From the opening chords to the final encore, the evening was a masterclass in musical intensity, proving that, decades into their career, The Hives are still a force to be reckoned with. This was not just a concert; it was a sonic baptism blasting through even the best ear protection. The Hives are a reminder of the enduring power of live music to captivate and transport audiences into the heart of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\n\nTHE HIVES\n\nWebsite Facebook Twitter\n\nKATE CLOVER\n\nWebsite Facebook Twitter\n\nBELLY UP TAVERN\n\nWebsite Facebook Twitter"

        "title": "Op-ed: Are we heading for a Solana DeFi Summer? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The crypto summer of 2020/21 saw most alternative Layer 1 protocols skyrocket to insane valuations and many projects in their respective ecosystems. This period became known to the wider industry as \u2018DeFi Summer.\u2019 With stimulus checks being handed out across the West and the looming uncertainty over the lifting of COVID lockdowns, the economic issues of the time spurred a tornado of wealth with seemingly exponential potential/possibility.\n\nLasting until May of 2021, this 6-month period of prosperity was followed by a long bear market, which could now be nearing its end, as suggested by recent market activity.\n\nThis has spurred rumors across the crypto sphere of a DeFi Summer 2.0. Several factors, including a recent surge in TVL, point towards this cycle starting not on Ethereum but on the Solana blockchain instead \u2013 what started these whispers, and what are the chances of follow through?\u2019\n\nOvercoming Ethereum\u2019s Hurdles: The Democratisation of DeFi Onboarding\n\nPersistent negative factors surrounding Ethereum are perhaps the strongest signs of a Solana-led DeFi Summer being on its way. The Ethereum chain has ongoing problems with high activity resulting in bloated gas fees and prices, which deter many people away from using it. This particular issue was evident during the last DeFi Summer. Solutions have arisen to help fix this problem since in the form of Layer 2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, Base, ZkSync + others).\n\nThe economic hurdle presented by Ethereum\u2019s high usage costs, combined with the complex nature of understanding and utilizing Layer 2 solutions, makes Ethereum less accessible to the average person. In contrast, Solana offers a lower-cost, more user-friendly platform for crypto engagement.\n\nSolana is an Ethereum-adjacent blockchain that defines itself in terms of its focus on ease of use for new consumers and potential for mass adoption.\n\nSolana\u2019s \u2018native\u2019 crypto wallet is Phantom, an intuitive, easy-to-use wallet also available on mobile. Within Phantom, users can store coins, and NFTs and natively stake the Solana token. Phantom is synonymous with Solana in the way that MetaMask is with Ethereum, the flagship wallet of the blockchain. Phantom grew from 40,000 users to 1.8 million in July-Dec 2021, which has since doubled to 3 million users, setting its sights on an end goal of 10 million weekly active users.\n\nWith crypto adoption traditionally being hindered by difficult setup and onboarding processes due to the complexity of wallets and security, the UI/UX of Phantom allows newcomers to learn the ins and outs of crypto with ease and quickly begin their journey in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nOwning 1 SOL vs Owning 1 ETH\n\nAnother advantage of Solana is the SOL cryptocurrency itself: $SOL currently sits at $57. Owning 1 Solana is attainable for most people, while owning 1 Ethereum is not. This removes a huge psychological price barrier for a new on-chain user.\n\nIf an amateur crypto investor sees that they can begin experimenting with $50 and become accustomed to low gas fees, fast transaction speeds, and the ability to bounce between protocols without hesitation, then transferring to Ethereum would seem alien\n\nBoth blockchains will, of course, co-exist; however, considering Ethereum\u2019s current status (not including layer 2s and future upgrades), most people cannot afford $30 to make 1 transaction out of their first $100 to test out crypto.\n\nPaying $0.0003 in fees to move the same $100 will hold wider appeal.\n\nIs Solana ready for a DeFi boom?\n\nData from DeFiLlama reveals that during the height of the DeFi Summer, Solana achieved a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $9.9 billion from 55.1 million transactions, accomplishing this with significantly less infrastructure than it has now.\n\nThe recent and anticipated airdrops from various Solana projects have shifted focus toward the platform. As more people enter the world of crypto, Solana is increasingly becoming their first choice owing to its affordability, speed, and user-friendliness, a deal sweetened by the prospect of receiving airdrops. With free tokens offered by an accessible platform, why would new users need to look elsewhere?\n\nPotential airdrops are another incentive that will attract users to Solana. While most of Ethereum\u2019s major DApps have already conducted airdrops, only a few of Solana\u2019s dapps have done so.\n\nWhile market conditions are improving daily, signaling a potential bull market on the horizon, these platforms will expand and attract more capital. This should, in turn, lead to more frequent airdrops. Consider a scenario where person A informs person B about receiving easy value from an airdrop in the crypto world. Naturally, person B will have their curiosity piqued and will likely emulate person A\u2019s actions in the hope of benefiting from such opportunities. Such chain reactions will be easily facilitated by Solana.\n\nThe chain\u2019s infrastructure has advanced significantly, expanding the surrounding community rapidly. The success of the recent Breakpoint conference at such a critical juncture positions Solana at the forefront of these exciting developments.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile it seems likely that Solana may spearhead a potential DeFi Summer 2.0, it\u2019s important to note that the chain itself won\u2019t be the sole catalyst, nor will it render Ethereum obsolete. It is the insight surrounding Solana\u2019s user-friendly and cost-effective features that mark it as the leading cryptocurrency for industry newcomers.\n\nAs more people engage, incentives will increase, leading to higher transaction volumes and a self-sustaining cycle of growth in motion. We can anticipate projects bridging over further expansion and a renewed opportunity for decentralized financial freedom.\n\nShould these developments align, the coincidence of a Solana-driven DeFi Summer with the summer of 2024 could be a truly exhilarating experience.\n\nMentioned in this article"
