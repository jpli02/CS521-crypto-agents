        "content": "The Solana price has experienced a significant uptrend in recent days, with SOL rising by almost 6% over the past week. However, in the last 24 hours, the altcoin has shown signs of consolidation. Continued consolidation could potentially cause it to lose its bullish momentum if it continues.\n\nThe technical outlook for Solana indicates that both bulls and bears are evenly matched due to the sideways movement on the daily chart. While buying strength has recovered, sellers still have the upper hand.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nDogecoin Price Forms A Falling Wedge Pattern, Can Price Touch $0.11? 1 year ago\n\nThe demand for SOL must increase in the immediate trading sessions, or accumulation may decline. Despite the indicators not fully favouring the bulls, SOL has the potential to rise above its immediate trading sessions if it remains above local support.\n\nThe SOL bulls must overcome two critical resistance levels for the price to continue rising. Broader market strength is also crucial for the asset. The market capitalization has also seen an uptick, indicating the presence of buyers in the market.\n\nSolana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart\n\nSOL was trading at $20.90 at the time of writing. The recent price appreciation allowed the bulls to break through a crucial resistance level and turn it into support. The overhead resistance for the altcoin was $21.50, and if breached, SOL could encounter another resistance at $23.40.\n\nSuccessfully surpassing $23.40 could drive SOL to $26. Conversely, the first line of support for the altcoin was at $19.30, and failing to remain above it could cause SOL to trade close to the $18 mark. The amount of Solana traded in the last session turned green indicating an influx of buying strength on the one-day chart.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nAlthough buyers were still trying to establish their position in the market, SOL was not entirely bullish. The Relative Strength Index showed a slight uptick but remained slightly below the half-line, indicating that there were more sellers than buyers.\n\nAdditionally, the price of SOL was below the 20-Simple Moving Average, indicating that demand was still low and sellers were driving the price momentum in the market."

        "content": "Bradley Allen Catcott was killed on August 15, 2022 while cycling on Carlsbad Boulevard after motorcyclist who was fleeing from park ranger struck and killed him.\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. \u2014 The brother of a 68-year-old Solana Beach cyclist who was struck and killed by an intoxicated motorcyclist in the midst of a high-speed chase by a California Park Ranger in August of 2022 is suing the state and the motorcyclist over his brother's death.\n\nOn August 15, 2022, Bradley Catcott was riding his bike in the northbound bike lane on Carlsbad Boulevard near Solomar Drive.\n\nUnbeknownst to Catcott, less than a mile south, California Park Officer Timothy Gunther was in a high-speed chase with 29-year-old Eric Monte Burns who was riding a 2021 FXL Harley Davidson motorcycle. Officer Gunther had tried to pull Burns over for speeding but Burns refused to stop.\n\nInstead, Burns fled at speeds reaching up to 100 miles per hour, according to the lawsuit filed by Catcott's brother which was based on statements from Officer Gunther and witnesses at the scene of the collision.\n\nAs Catcott was preparing to make a left turn at Solomar Drive, Burns ran into him, sending Catcott flying to the opposite side of the intersection. Meanwhile, Burns, who later failed a blood alcohol test, and his female passenger were also ejected, sliding approximately 400 yards along northbound Carlsbad Boulevard.\n\nCatcott, who according to his obituary worked for the San Diego Unified School District, died at the scene. Burns and his passenger were seriously injured.\n\nBurns was later arrested and pleaded guilty to evading an officer causing death. The District Attorney's Office agreed to drop a charge of vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence. On March 16, a judge sentenced Burns to four years in prison.\n\nThe newly filed lawsuit from Bret Catcott names Burns as well as the parks officer for engaging Burns in a high-speed pursuit, putting drivers and pedestrians at risk.\n\n\"Officer Gunther was in uniform and was negligently operating the State Vehicle and was engaged in a wrongful and negligent pursuit of the motorcycle, which directly led to a collision with Bradley Catcott \u2013 causing his untimely and tragic death,\" reads the February 27 lawsuit.\n\nCatcott's attorney, Jim Hayes, tells CBS 8 that while nothing can be done to change the outcome of that day, they want basic answers as to why this happened and what prompted the high-speed pursuit.\n\n\u201cThe family is still very much in mourning over this tragic and untimely loss of Brad Catcott. He was a beloved brother, uncle, and cherished friend to so many people. The void that he left for these individuals can never be filled,\" said Hayes.\n\n\"In filing the civil lawsuit, we are trying to find additional answers for Brad\u2019s family and friends. For example, what initiated this high-speed pursuit? Was this a necessary and proper high-speed pursuit by the State Parks Officer, and was there a policy or procedure in place to avoid situations like this from happening, and if so, was it followed correctly? The only way to find these answers is through the civil litigation process.\u201d"
