So the UX becomes very, very complicated.\u201d\n\nOn the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple), Yakovenko gives an example from his experience working in Web2 company, Dropbox. \u201cWe had one giant MySQL database for all the folders because as soon as you start fragmenting them, [it] becomes very hard to create links between different users of different folders.\u201d\n\n\u201cTracking consistency between two different databases is a major pain in the ass. You would have to synchronize everything through the [layer-1].\u201d\n\nThe fragmentation, at a large enough scale, causes \u201cmassive composability\u201d and user experience problems, according to Yakovenko. \u201cYou have to re-sync through the [layer-1] and that\u2019s going to create the same kind of cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very, very difficult to deal with,\u201d he says.\n\nYakovenko uses the example of NFTs to illustrate the problem. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an NFT in every rollup. It actually can only be bridged to one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I want a specific NFT, the marketplace where it\u2019s sold is the marketplace that I need to buy in \u2014 and it can only exist in one of those.\u201d\n\nBy creating different states, layer-2s break up the composability of marketplaces for a particular NFT, Yakoveko explains. \u201cThat\u2019s the fundamental challenge with [layer-2s].\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an unavoidable trade-off, he says. \u201cYou get a performance benefit because you create this single global lock around a state and then you can work on it asynchronously from everything else, but you\u2019re creating a very hard composability challenge.\u201d\n\nWhat about just one layer-2?\n\nTheoretically, a singular layer-2 solution, rather than the current variety that exists in the Ethereum ecosystem, would simplify the composability problem, Yakovenko says.\n\n\u201cYou take [Solana Virtual Machine] that runs as many things in parallel as it can,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt always increases hardware capacity to meet the demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, you take all the data and you dump it into danksharding\u201d which ideally would be, he says, the \u201cperfect implementation of a [data availability] layer that tries to maximize its [data availability] system.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you have one [layer-2], one bandwidth-optimized system. That\u2019s basically what Solana is,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cSolana itself can asynchronously execute all the programs, and then pick forks separately in a separate pipeline from execution of the programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the forks are quickly picked,\u201d he says, \u201cbut then these bigger systems can execute on the programs. You can then do batch [zero-knowledge] verification, if that\u2019s what you need. All that stuff is all doable on Solana.\u201d\n\nYakovenko notes that a \u201cfundamental difference\u201d persists between Solana and multi-layered chain solutions. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a demand for Solana to do danksharding because that really breaks that idea of information synchrony across the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to split the data availability,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though you might be able to get an improvement in bandwidth there, it actually does still have a trade-off.\u201d\n\nYakovenko believes in the necessity of a system that actively avoids asynchronous solutions. \u201cWhen I submit one bit here,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s equally observed in Singapore and Brazil, everywhere in the world, as fast as physics allow, because that actually creates value for the world.\u201d\n\nThe goal, Yakovenko explains, is to minimize \u201cinformation asymmetry between any two players.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt allows for fair markets to exist,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the one core use-case that you really can\u2019t optimize away with all these other systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of having a single rollup that can take up all of the bandwidth of the data availability layer, whether it\u2019s Solana or Celestia or Ethereum,\u201d he says, \u201cthat idea is something that I think a lot of the engineers agree is probably the more efficient design.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
