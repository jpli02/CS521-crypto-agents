        "content": "On Friday, the Solana SOL/USD ecosystem's standout token and one of this year's top-performing cryptocurrencies, BONK BONK/USD, experienced notable gains.\n\nWhat Happened: Bonk BONK/USD has surged by 12% in the last 24 hours, bringing its 30-day increase to over 264%. The trading volume expanded by 98.6% in the same period. Year-to-date, the memecoin has skyrocketed by 7,663.7%.\n\nAccording to CoinGape, BONK's price is currently under considerable downward pressure, having broken below the 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart and showing a rapid decline. This trend is affecting its market value and may indicate an impending death cross on the 4-hour chart.\n\nHowever, the report also notes that, despite this week\u2019s downturn, the recent bullish trajectory offers hope for BONK's price. It further suggests the likelihood of a continued positive trend, supported by optimistic market sentiment and the token's expanding community in the weeks ahead.\n\nAlso Read: Is Santa Betting On BONK?

This resulted in approximately $4.8 million in fee revenue during that period, matching the levels of prominent DeFi protocols like Aave and Curve.\n\nBlockworks Research analyst Dan Smith took to X, stating, \u201cBonk Bot is doing insane numbers, and at this point in the cycle?

        "content": "Fri 29 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nWith its SOL token back well above 100 dollars, Solana marks a resounding comeback and positions itself as a formidable opponent to Ethereum\u2019s dominance. Let\u2019s dissect the mechanisms of this resurgence.\n\nDoes Solana\u2019s Shadow Loom Over the Realm of Ethereum?\n\nLaunched in 2020, Solana bets everything on speed. Its blockchain can process 65,000 transactions per second, compared to a mere 15 for Ethereum. A considerable advantage for attracting decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2021, this argument captivated the masses. SOL surged spectacularly, from $1 in January to $260 in November. Its proponents even announced that Solana was on track to overtake Ethereum in the smart contracts market.\n\nHowever, the FTX debacle changed the game. The crash of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2018s platform, closely linked to Solana, sent SOL below $10. The blockchain also faced criticism for its technical vulnerabilities. Its future seemed uncertain.\n\nA Spectacular Comeback\n\nYet, the tide began to turn at the start of 2023. SOL rebounded sharply to $20 after the FTX collapse, and then surpassed $100 in mid-February.\n\nSeveral factors explain this rebound. On one hand, investors are returning to cryptocurrencies after difficult months. On the other hand, new projects are emerging on Solana, attracted by its low transaction fees.\n\nTrading volumes are surging, fueled by risky speculation. Last weekend, Solana even overtook Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of spot transaction volume in SOL/USDT, reaching an impressive $1.037 billion on Binance.\n\nDoes this spectacular comeback mean that Solana is threatening the dominance of Ethereum? Not yet. With 29 billion dollars of assets locked, Vitalik Buterin\u2018s blockchain remains well ahead. Solana is worth 15 times less, at 1.5 billion according to data from DefiLlama, despite its rapid growth.\n\nNevertheless, this contender poses a serious threat. Solana continues to attract projects thanks to its low fees and record speed. If it overcomes its stability issues, it could continue to gain market share from Ethereum in the coming years. Their rivalry promises to be thrilling.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program! Earn points for each article you read and gain access to exclusive rewards.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSolana (SOL) has experienced notable volatility, with rapid price fluctuations and shifts in its ranking within the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRipple (XRP) is the focus of bullish predictions by analysts, forecasting significant price increases in the coming months.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium blockchain solution has reached a significant milestone in transaction volume.\n\nSOL\u2019s Price Swings\n\nOne of the best-performing crypto assets this year \u2013 Solana (SOL) \u2013 has experienced severe volatility in the past week. Its price exploded to almost $125 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data) on December 25 (the highest level recorded since April 2022), whereas its market capitalization exceeded the $50 billion mark.\n\nSOL became the fourth-largest crypto asset, outpacing Binance Coin (BNB). However, the latter restored its previous position following an impressive (yet brief) rally above $330.\n\nAccording to some on-chain metrics, SOL might be on the verge of another upswing. Total value locked (TVL) on the network has surged to almost $1.5 billion in the past few days, while trading volume has stood well above $1 billion since mid-December.\n\n\n\nSolana has also been quite successful in the non-fungible token field, with NFT sales volume for the last week hitting almost $75 million. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s figure currently stands at around $72 million.\n\nWhere is Ripple (XRP) Headed?\n\nAnother digital asset that has captured the attention of crypto participants in 2023 is Ripple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP. Despite currently trading far below its yearly peak of over $0.80 (observed in July), it remains a subject of bullish predictions.\n\nEarlier this week, the X (Twitter) user EGRAG CRYPTO suggested that XRP could reach $1.20 by the end of March next year. It is worth noting that such a potential price increase could almost coincide with the Bitcoin halving (scheduled for April 2024).\n\nCutting the reward for miners in half would decrease the supply of BTC and possibly boost its price, provided the demand remains the same or increases. BTC\u2019s exponential surges have positively affected altcoins numerous times in the past, meaning XRP might benefit from the upcoming event.\n\nThe analyst using the X handle Dark Defender has also envisioned a bright future, forecasting a jump to $1.88 and then to $5.85, expecting the all-time high (ATH) target to be reached in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThose willing to dive deeper and check how XRP might finish the ongoing year could take a look at our dedicated video below:\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Hit Another Milestone\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s layer-2 blockchain solution \u2013 Shibarium \u2013 has also made the headlines recently. As CryptoPotato reported, total transactions on the network surpassed 200 million on December 27. The figure continued rising in the following days, currently standing at approximately 216 million.\n\nShibarium\u2019s role is primarily centered around enhancing the functionality and scalability of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It aims to speed up transaction processing times and lower fees. If you\u2019re curious to find out more about the feature, feel free to take a look at our clip:"

        "content": "As this year ends, the recent performance by Solana (SOL) positions it as one of the biggest gainers this year, especially in the previous month, where it added almost 80% to its value.\n\nCryptocurrency traders and investors contemplate SOL\u2019s potential price ranges in the coming year.\n\nDespite still being below its all-time peak of $246.67, this crypto displays indications of recovery in the recent period, which has driven its price above the $100 threshold for the first time in 2023 and propelled its market capitalization to fifth place among cryptocurrencies.\n\nA surge of 500% offers new SOL entry points\n\nThere has been a notable surge in the price of SOL, marked by an impressive increase of over 500% in two months. Notably, a rotation trend is discernible, with a shift towards Ethereum (ETH) and other ecosystems, signaling a potential slowdown in the current momentum for Solana.\n\nThere is a notable interest in long-term entries within the $70-80 range in higher timeframe trading. This strategic approach reflects a careful consideration of price levels for establishing enduring positions in the market, as highlighted in a post on X by crypto expert Michael van de Poppe on December 28.\n\nPotential SOL buy points in the future. Source: Michael van de Poppe\n\nShould this asset experience additional retracement, the optimal entry point for traders seeking long-term positions would be $60.\n\nPotential reset may catalyze further price increase\n\nWhile experiencing a drawback from the recent high of nearly $125 and settling just below the threshold of $110, SOL still holds the potential to continue with its gains.\n\nThe current price action of SOL suggests an attempt to retest the 4-hour trend successfully. Reclaiming the cluster and achieving new highs is a logical progression in the trend. The ongoing shakeout phase seems to be nearing completion, indicating potential stabilization in the market, as per crypto analyst Jelle\u2019s post on December 29.\n\nA potential retest of SOL price at 4-hour chart. Source: Jelle\n\nIn case of the successful completion of the retest, Solana might enter 2024 between the range of $130 and $140.\n\nA long-term position on SOL might be a viable strategy\n\nTraders and analysts seem optimistic about the price of this digital asset, as it managed to break its resistance point and successfully settle above it. For some, the prospect of further price increases in the future seems like a likely scenario.\n\nConsidering a strategic approach, there is a contemplation of initiating a long position on SOL after its breakthrough and successful retest of the $110 mark. This development is noteworthy and warrants vigilant observation for potential market movements, according to crypto investment agency Phoenix ICF\u2019s post on December 29.\n\nPotential further SOL price increases in the long term. Source: Phoenix ICF\n\nAI Solana price predictions for 2024\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms utilized by the cryptocurrency analytics and monitoring platform CoinCodex suggest the likelihood of continued expansion for Solana in the forthcoming months. Projections anticipate its value to reach $349.05 by December 30, 2024, which would mean a new all-time high for this crypto.\n\nSolana 1-year price prediction. Source: CoinCodex\n\nThis amount represents a notable surge in the price of this asset, which at one point should surpass the $500 threshold, according to predictions.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nAt the time of press, SOL is traded at $108.07, exhibiting a 6.37% rise on its daily chart. Furthermore, it has seen a 14.58% increase over the past week and has garnered a gain of 78.03% in the last month, contributing to an overall upward movement of 1047.44% over the past year.\n\nSolana YTD price chart.
