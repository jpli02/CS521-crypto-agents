The Lowdown on SAND, WLD, AVAX & $INJ Unlocks and What They Mean Torsten Hartmann\n\nAugust is shaping up to be a pivotal month for several high-profile cryptocurrencies due to scheduled token unlocks. For crypto investors and enthusiasts, keeping an eye on these upcoming unlocks is essential to understand their potential impact on token prices and make informed decisions. This August, tokens worth hundreds of millions of dollars across projects like Sandbox ($SAND), Worldcoin ($WLD), Avalanche ($AVAX), Optimism ($OP), and Injective Protocol ($INJ) are set to be unlocked.\n\nWhile token unlocks inevitably increase supply and tend to create downward price pressure, their overall impact depends on various factors like the unlock amount, recipient details, project fundamentals, and market conditions.\n\nNew Meme Coin to Watch Aiming to be Next $BONK, $WIF or $MEW Milei Moneda is a new meme coin inspired by the political and economic views of Javier Milei, an Argentine president known for his libertarian and pro-Bitcoin stance. You have an opportunity with the ongoing low presale price to get in early! Sponsored Show more + Show less \u2013\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what to expect and some insights to guide your decisions:\n\n1. $SAND \u2013 Unlocking on August 14th\n\n$SAND tokens worth $133.14M, which constitutes 16.16% of the circulating supply, are set to be unlocked. This hefty amount is primarily earmarked for the team, advisors, and key investors. Historically, advisors and investors tend to offload their tokens, so we might see some downward price pressure post-unlock. However, given that $SAND\u2019s current price is hovering near its 2023 low, the market may have already factored this in.\n\n2. $WLD \u2013 A Potential Powder Keg?\n\nWorldcoin\u2019s token, $WLD, is in a precarious position. Despite its market cap of $270M, its fully diluted valuation is a staggering $22.8B. A majority of the tokens set to enter circulation are community-allocated and team-governed. Notably, market makers hold sway over most of the existing circulating supply.\n\n3. $AVAX \u2013 Unlocking on August 26th\n\nTokens worth $118.7M, making up 2.76% of the circulating supply of $AVAX, will be unlocked. The primary recipients of these tokens will be the team and strategic collaborators. Previous unlocks have led to a short-lived dip in the $AVAX price, so history might repeat itself, but any impact is expected to be transient.\n\n4. $OP \u2013 Unlocking on August 30th\n\n$OP tokens valued at $41.3M, representing 3.37% of its circulating supply, are on the unlock radar. These are designated for investors and core contributors of the project. Given the current buzz surrounding $OP, a significant price dip post-unlock seems improbable. As someone deeply immersed in the crypto landscape, I\u2019d advise against betting on a downturn.\n\n5. $INJ \u2013 Unlocking on August 21st\n\nCome August 21st, 3.41% of the $INJ circulating supply will be unleashed. These tokens, earmarked for \u201cecosystem development\u201d, are likely to remain under team control. Should the team decide to liquidate these assets, it would likely be a gradual process spread over months. Some selling pressure is anticipated, but a drastic plunge seems unlikely.\n\nThere are a few ways that token unlocks can impact the price of a cryptocurrency token:\n\nSupply increase \u2013 Token unlocks usually refer to tokens that were initially locked up or restricted from being traded becoming freely tradable. This increases the circulating supply of the token, which could put downward pressure on the price if the new supply outpaces demand.\n\nSelling pressure \u2013 Founders, employees, investors etc whose tokens are unlocking may want to sell some or all of their newly tradable tokens to realize profits or get liquidity. This selling pressure could drive the price down.\n\nReduced scarcity \u2013 Locked tokens create artificial scarcity for a cryptocurrency, so unlocking them reduces this scarcity. Lower scarcity tends to lead to decreased prices.\n\nVesting schedules \u2013 Some token unlocks happen according to vesting schedules that space out the unlocking over time. This can minimize negative price impact vs a sudden, large unlock.\n\nPositive factors \u2013 In some cases token unlocks are indicative of progress being made by the project. This could actually boost confidence and offset selling pressures.\n\nOther fundamentals \u2013 Ultimately the impact on price will depend on overall token demand, use cases for the token, the wider crypto market conditions etc. The unlocking itself may not outweigh these other factors.\n\nToken unlocks tend to create downward pressure on price, all else being equal. But the overall price impact will vary depending on the specifics of the unlock and the project\u2019s fundamentals. Monitoring the unlock schedule and amount can help gauge potential impacts.\n\nIn conclusion, August promises to be an eventful month for crypto aficionados. As always, stay informed, do your research, and tread wisely.\n\nStay savvy, crypto community! \ud83c\udf10"
