The alert was intended for holders of the BONK meme coin listed on the Solana blockchain.\n\nHowever, some crypto community members were quick to point out that the BONK token addressed by the security firm was separate from the original meme token listed on Solana.

One week after launch, Bonk\u2019s popularity skyrocketed by 4424% due to rapid adoption by the Solana community.

Indeed, this turned out to be very beneficial for the severely bleeding SOL, whose stock had dropped to single digits, and its market cap had fallen ten times since the beginning of 2022. Because of the growing public interest, some crypto exchanges, such as Huobi, have announced that they will list the meme coin.\n\nNevertheless, the latest confusion regarding the BONK clone had taken a hit on the meme coin bringing down its price by 6% soon after the alert was issued. At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.0000012 per coin, according to data from CoinMarketCap."

        "content": "As the crypto developer ecosystem expands, major ecosystems outside of the top two cryptocurrencies \u2014 Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 are growing, according to a new report.\n\nAbout 72% of monthly active developers (devs) are working on blockchains that are not part of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, according to the 2022 Electric Capital Developer Report, which trawled code commits across open source repositories.\n\nSolana saw the highest number of new developers contributing to the ecosystem, with its developer count rising by 83%, the fastest of any major blockchain. Compared to that, Polygon saw a 40% rise in developer count, Cosmos saw 25% and Polkadot saw 2%, the report showed.\n\n\u201cDevelopers will build where they see technology advantages, and Solana delivers faster transactions and lower costs than alternatives,\u201d Solana co-founder Raj Gokal told TechCrunch. \u201cBut they will also build where they see other kinds of advantages, such as an active community.\u201d\n\nThe growth of the developer ecosystem on Solana can be attributed to a mix of education efforts and resources, community engagement, technical advantages and business opportunities, Gokal said.\n\nEven with around 2,000 total developers as of December 2022, Solana is still about 3,500 developers short of Ethereum\u2019s count, which had a total of about 5,700 developers. It\u2019s important to note, though, that Ethereum launched in 2013 and Solana launched in 2018, so the former has enjoyed a five-year head start.\n\nThese Solana developers are working on \u201ca range of use cases,\u201d from evolving the NFT and DeFi spaces to getting retailers to experiment with decentralized payment rails like Solana Pay, Gokal said. \u201cRight now, game devs on Solana are very active and innovating heavily to create games that are both fun to play and rewarding for players to participate.\u201d\n\nSeparately, The Solana Mobile Stack and Saga phone are attracting attention from developers interested in creating mobile web3 apps, Gokal added. \u201cThe mobile opportunities on Solana will only get better as Saga and SMS get exposed to more people.\u201d\n\nSolana, which is approaching its fifth birthday, has the highest number of developers since it was launched compared to other blockchains, according to a chart (shown below) from Electric Capital.\n\nSolana\u2019s total developer count spiked in November 2022 during its Breakpoint conference and hackathon event. In comparison, Polygon has roughly half the developers but has existed for around the same time.\n\n\u201cThe creation of new technologies at different times naturally brings about different use cases and opportunities,\u201d Gokal said. \u201cSolana is a high-performance blockchain where transactions are inexpensive and fast to settle. There will continue to be use cases for other networks, but speed, efficiency and low costs usually always attract the most activity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Solana Beach data, Solana\u2019s network can currently execute 3,531 transactions per second (TPS). The TPS measures a network\u2019s speed and scalability while showing the maximum number of transactions the blockchain can carry out \u2014 if needed. In comparison, Ethereum averages about 15 TPS.\n\nGokal said Solana Foundation will continue to host hackathons and hacker houses to help get more devs get involved. But this year might be different.\n\n\u201c2023 might just be the year when other devs already building on Solana collectively lead the direction of the network. We\u2019ve already seen that with a community-led hackathon happening right now and more devs are stepping forward to contribute to the core Solana network,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier last year, there was more hope in the crypto community that it was in a temporary downturn, but sentiments have changed.\n\n\u201cI think people fully understand the extent to which macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated across all aspects of the economy and that there are bigger issues at play, such as inflation,\u201d Gokal said. \u201cPeople now seem mentally prepared for an extended bearish period, which is the best time to experiment and find product-market fit.\u201d\n\nAfter crypto exchange FTX collapsed in November, there was a lot of uncertainty across the space, Gokal noted. \u201c[It] quickly gave way to an understanding that the ecosystem is bigger than any one individual.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all that in mind, as well as the Solana network performing better than ever, the time is now for devs to really dream up new use cases and build them,\u201d Gokal added."
