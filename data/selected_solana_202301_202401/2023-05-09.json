This is showcased by the announcement that it has opened access for the general public to start ordering the phone. As revealed, the mobile phone is ready to ship to multiple locations, including the U.S., EU and Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead full announcementhttps://t.co/ko9miEHQLk \u2014 Solana Mobile \ud83c\udf31 (@solanamobile) May 8, 2023\n\nSolana broke a record when it became the first blockchain protocol to design and launch a mobile phone in its bid to bring Web3.0 closer to the average smartphone user. At launch, Saga was only accessible to users who had preordered the device, and the opening of the public order presents wider adoption for users across the board.\n\nThe Solana Mobile phone embodies many innovations in one. While it is built to compete with other smartphones on the market today, it is infused with a series of Web3.0 applications that can make accessing blockchain a matter of clicks.\n\nThe phone in itself is secured by the Solana protocol and guarantees direct access to the benefits of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) while also affording room to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) hosted on Solana.\n\nSOL to get Saga boost\n\nThat the public will now be able to order and secure Solana Mobile as their device is an indirect way to get SOL as a digital currency in the hands of more people. The series of innovations embodied through applications resident on Solana and accessible via Saga can help in driving positive demand momentum for SOL tokens.\n\nThis will have an underlying impact on the price of the digital currency, which is currently down by 3.63% to $20.50, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The impact of the Saga Mobile phone on Solana may be more long term, but it offers hope that the blockchain has a defined utility."

        "content": "Tue 09 May 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, the creator of Solana, was recently interviewed on Token Terminal\u2019s YouTube channel. It was an opportunity for him to discuss the great capabilities of his blockchain. He declared that Ethereum\u2019s rival could meet global demands.\n\nHere\u2019s what Solana (SOL) is missing for global adoption\n\nEarlier this month, Anatoly Yakovenko argued that Solana remains strong despite the FTX case. Now, he declares that Ethereum\u2019s rival is capable of meeting the needs of hundreds of millions of users. Solana could thus handle global blockchain requirements. Yakovenko supported that he sees this blockchain \u201chandling all the world\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nThe founder explained: \u201cbecause when you look at today\u2019s bandwidth infrastructure around data centers, the one gigabit is the free tier. You get a box, they give you one gigabit for free and it costs less than a dollar per terabyte of egress right now, so bandwidth is ridiculously cheap right now.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEvery two years there\u2019s a new generation, so from my perspective, I think we can already handle hundreds of millions of users and we have an abundance of capacity.\u201d However, Yakovenko acknowledges that Ethereum\u2019s rival does not yet have the necessary applications for global adoption. He indicated: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the applications to actually attract those users yet.\u201d\n\nYakovenko cited some growth engines that could promote the adoption of the blockchain by a larger number of people. He notably talked about the Helium IoT device network that recently successfully migrated to the Solana blockchain. He also mentioned the Hivemapper platform, which is a decentralized map-building tool.\n\n\u201cHelium created close to a million IoT (Internet of Things) hot spots, that\u2019s really cool. Think about virtual tokens moving around between people with cryptography impacting the physical world. There\u2019s literally a close to a million antennas generated from that, and they\u2019re going to attempt to do the same thing with 5G,\u201d explained the creator of Solana.\n\nSolana has launched several major projects since the beginning of the year. There was notably the launch of a carbon emissions\u2019 tracker. However, the SOL token is currently trading around $21.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "What is the SUI NFT Scene? - NFTevening.com",
        "content": "Smart money is flooding into the Sui NFT market. The new Layer 1 blockchain launched its mainnet last week and already has a vibrant NFT scene. What do we know about NFTs on Sui?\n\nWhat Do We Know About Sui NFTs?\n\nSpeculators have labeled Sui as a potential \u201cSolana killer\u201d. It has fast transactions and low fees similar to Solana, but it remains to be seen if this will be enough to establish SUI as a top blockchain for NFTs. After all, Aptos and Near both started strong but quickly lost relevancy after their initial hype wore off.\n\nSui NFT mania kicked off with the much-anticipated release of Fuddies. Fuddies, a 10,000-piece owl PFP project, had a strong ramp-up to its mint with massive influencer marketing, an allowlist campaign, and the support of Mysten Labs, the owner of Sui\u2019s biggest NFT marketplace Clutchy. The collection started with an allowlist mint for 95 SUI (about $125) before running a Dutch-auction style mint. The dutch-auction began at 300 SUI and gradually came down before minting out around 150 SUI.\n\nUnfortunately, the Clutchy marketplace disappointed in its first appearance on a big stage. The website went down and frustrated traders who looked to flip the mint for a quick profit. Eventually, however, Clutchy came back online and Fuddies reported about 605,000 SUI of volume, worth approximately $792,500.\n\nThe Fuddies Twitter account went on the offensive after the dust settled. It tweeted, \u201cFuddies just passed the entirety of @0xPolygonLabs in 24-hour sales volume and @SuiNetwork didn\u2019t even have to pay us to launch on their chain.\u201d This post earned a ton of engagement and captures the project and Sui\u2019s underdog mentality.\n\nFuddies is not the only successful project on Sui, however. Suishi, A sushi-theme PFP project, also managed to mint out its entire collection. Since minting out, it has a lifetime volume of 21,000 SUI already. Clearly, there is a demand among NFT collectors to get early projects from new blockchains in case they ever have historical significance in the future.\n\nWhat Makes Sui Different?\n\nSui is a proof-of-stake blockchain that runs on a modified version of the Move programming language. It has a cap of 10 billion SUI tokens that will be used for gas fees, staking, and governance. Half of the tokens are allocated to the Community Reserve, a fund for future development managed by the Sui Foundation.\n\nThe majority of the remaining tokens went to people who contributed to the project. An additional 14% of the supply went to investors. Community members then had the option to purchase the SUI token when the mainnet launched last Wednesday.\n\nClutchy founder and CEO Jacob \u201cDizzy Lizzy\u201d Lawless commented that his marketplace has \u201ctons of interest from influencers, investors, creators and onlookers.\u201d Part of this interest comes from Sui\u2019s ability to handle more advanced capabilities than other blockchains. Sui has sufficient scalability to allow dynamic NFTs to update in real time. For example, in-game items such as weapons or armor can improve during gameplay.\n\nThis application might be a huge difference maker for Sui. It has already helped catch the attention of several big gaming upcoming gaming titles. Bushi, an Overwatch-style FPS, chose to launch on Sui. Similarly, The Walking Dead universe will release a game on Sui in the future. Another hotly-anticipated Web3 game, Panzerdogs, found Sui compelling enough to pivot away from Solana in favor of it.\n\nThe Future of Sui\n\nWhen asked about Sui, pseudonymous Web3 advisor Dabblerer stated, \u201cI feel like there\u2019s still a lot of interesting experimentation going on, culminating in another wave of NFT and dapp innovation. The launches are inspired by lessons learned by early movers with some different takes.\u201d\n\nMajor exchanges have already taken notice. Since launching last week, Sui has already been listed on Binance, OKX, Kucoin, and Bybit. Clearly, these Web3 companies are expecting Sui to see plenty of volume and are preparing themselves to meet that demand.\n\nTime will tell is Sui does manage to someday rival Ethereum and Solana for NFT supremacy. It has had some early success, however, and does seem poised to make it interesting moving into the next market cycle."
