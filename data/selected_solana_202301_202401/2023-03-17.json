All 535 NFTs were first burned down by the DeGods team to cut supply after being minted on the Solana blockchain in 2021.\n\n500 DeGods will be minted with Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWe recommend you have a self-custody Bitcoin wallet with 0.444+ BTC ready to go.\n\n\n\nYou will also need a separate Ordinals wallet to receive your inscription.\n\n\n\nThe mint will be first come, first serve. More details on the mechanics shortly. pic.twitter.com/q1Yg6gQOMW \u2014 DeGods (@DeGodsNFT) March 16, 2023\n\nIn a Twitter announcement, DeGods mentioned the launch of their Ordinal NFTs is a first-of-its-kind minting experience. It will be a public mint event with a first come, first serve basis that has hyped the DeGods community and investors.\n\nDeGods have also stated that minters will need a self-custody Bitcoin Wallet with 0.444+ BTC available, along with an Ordinals wallet to receive the inscription.\n\nThe minimum BTC statement hints us to believe that the floor price for the DeGods Ordinals will be around 0.444 BTC.\n\nIn another tweet, DeGods mentioned that 500 DeGods would be available in the BTC mint, and the other 34 would be auctioned/raffled with the in-house $DUST tokens one day later.\n\nThe first BTC DeGod auction of the NFT, titled \u201cThe Orginal Frank\u201d ended at a winning bid of a whooping 44,252 $DUST, around USD 80,096 at the time of writing.\n\nHolders of the original DeGods and DeadGod NFTs can stake their NFT to earn $DUST, which holders can use to upgrade NFTs and participate in raffles and other events in the DeGods community.\n\nDeGods is the first community in the NFT space to have acquired a professional basketball team, Killers32, in the BIG3 league. DeGod NFT holders have courtside access, ticket access, and interactions with the coach and players; talk about being GODS!"

        "content": "Disclaimer The CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency community price estimate is based only on the votes of its users. Estimates do not guarantee end-of-month prices.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market continues to recover despite a widespread crisis in the banking sector, and Solana (SOL) is no exception, leading the cryptocurrency community to bet on its further price improvement, particularly by the end of the third month of 2023.\n\nIndeed, based on 1,062 votes cast by the members of the crypto tracking platform CoinMarketCap by press time, Solana is expected to reach an average price of $21.8 on March 31, 2023, as per the latest data retrieved on March 17.\n\nShould the community\u2019s predictions come true, it would result in an increase of 7.46% or +$1.513 on the current price of Solana, which at the time of publication was changing hands at the price of $20.28, according to the information accessed by Finbold.\n\nSolana end of March price estimation. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nSOL technical analysis\n\nHaving said that, the community\u2019s optimism around Solana is yet to reflect on the one-day sentiment gauges based on its technical analysis (TA) over at the finance tracking website TradingView, which is still largely \u2018neutral\u2019 at 10, based on oscillators indicating \u2018buy\u2019 at 2 and moving averages (MA) in the \u2018neutral\u2019 zone at 1 (indicating both \u2018sell\u2019 and \u2018buy\u2019 at 7).\n\nSOL 1-day trading gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nAs things stand, Solana is currently changing hands at the price of $20.28, up 3.58% on the day, as well as climbing 17.35% over the previous seven days, as it reversed the losses of 6.88% accrued over the past month, as charts indicate.\n\nSolana 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWhether Solana manages to realize the community\u2019s projections will largely depend on the developments surrounding the ecosystem, such as whales moving significant amounts of SOL to the crypto trading platform Coinbase and the upcoming migration of the Helium (HNT) network to Solana, as well as the atmosphere on the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Binance said in an announcement that effective March 23, users would not be able to trade the token.\n\nHNT was trading as low as $1.52 at one point Friday, according to CoinGecko.

It reached its $54.88 all-time high just months later in November 2021.\n\nBut it has faced troubles lately: scooter rideshare startup Lime and cloud software giant Salesforce both denied last year that they had an active partnership with Helium\u2014despite their logos appearing on its website at the time."
