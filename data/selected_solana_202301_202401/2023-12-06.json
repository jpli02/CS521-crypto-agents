        "title": "Solana Dominates Ethereum In Daily Active Wallets, SOL Back To $140? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Solana (SOL), the fourth-generation blockchain, has staged a remarkable comeback, looking at on-chain metrics. Citing Artemis data, Step Data Insights on X noted that Solana\u2019s daily active wallets flipped Ethereum\u2019s, the pioneer smart contract platform. This development is when SOL prices have been ripping past resistance levels in the past few months.\n\nSolana\u2019s Resurgence Continues, Daily Active Wallets Flips Ethereum\n\nAccording to Step Data Insights, Solana\u2019s daily active wallets currently hover at around 400,000, slightly edging past Ethereum\u2019s. This spike in activity suggests that Solana is attracting a growing user base, and more people are keen to explore its ecosystems, comprising DeFi, NFTs, and other protocols.\n\nAdditional data from Artemis shows that Solana also eclipses Ethereum in the number of daily transactions. Although Ethereum leads in DeFi total value locked (TVL), Solana\u2019s low fee and scalable environment could explain why users opt for this high-performance network.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nOverall, the Solana recovery could triggered by recent favorable price action in Q4 2023. To quantify, Step Data Insights notes that SOL has risen by over 210% in the past three months. During this time, ETH\u2019s gains have capped.\n\nThe analytic platform states that the coin only rose by 39%. To illustrate, in the last three months, SOL rose from around $17 to peak at approximately $70. Meanwhile, ETH expanded from roughly $1,500 to peak at about $2,300, recorded on December 6.\n\nThis recovery points to increasing investor confidence. However, time will tell whether SOL will extend gains in the sessions. From the daily chart, prices have been moving horizontally for the better part of H2 November to early December 2023.\n\nThe immediate resistance line is at $70. With the SOL moving inside a bull flag, any upswing above November 2023 highs will be the building block for a possible leg-up that will lift SOL to April 2022 highs of $140.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Hopes, Firedancer Lifting Solana\n\nAltcoins, including Solana, have been racing higher as the crypto market recovers. Following a court ruling, SOL is relatively firm despite the FTX estate being permitted to liquidate the coin in the secondary markets to repay creditors.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nHopes of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the first Bitcoin ETF have also benefited Solana. However, the recent release of Firedancer, a validator client developed by Jump Crypto, on testnet has supported SOL.\n\nThe client will make the network more resilient and performant. Firedancer will go live in the H1 2024. Once it goes live, the new client is expected to improve Solana\u2019s reliability.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Robinhood, the stock trading app that also lets users buy and sell crypto, announced early Thursday that it has officially launched crypto trading in the European Union, one month after it had signaled plans to do so in a quarterly earnings report.\n\nAs part of its push into the EU, Robinhood will list 26 cryptocurrencies, including 11 not currently available to its U.S. customers. Most notably, the company\u2019s EU offering will include SOL, MATIC, and ADA\u2014the respective tokens for the Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains\u2014which Robinhood delisted on its U.S. platform in June in the face of regulatory pressures.\n\n\u201cThe EU has developed one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive policies for crypto asset regulation, which is why we chose the region to anchor Robinhood Crypto\u2019s international expansion plans,\u201d said Johann Kerbrat, Robinhood\u2019s head of crypto, in a statement.\n\nRobinhood\u2019s expansion into Europe is one of the publicly traded company\u2019s largest crypto announcements to come about since it formally launched its Web3 wallet in January. Despite seeing a decline in crypto revenues since mid-2021, the online brokerage has remained committed to the legally troubled industry\u2014though things may be turning a corner as Robinhood disclosed crypto trading volumes were up 75% in November from the previous month.\n\nRobinhood, perhaps best known for its role in the meme-stock trading craze in early 2021, first unveiled its crypto trading platform in 2018, listing only Bitcoin and Ethereum. Since then, the platform has sought to expand its offerings, making crypto a core part of its business model.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, revenue from crypto transactions accounted for approximately 41% of its total revenue, as the memecoin Dogecoin skyrocketed in price. In fact, in that same quarter, fees purely from Dogecoin trading accounted for almost 26% of its total revenue, according to its quarterly report.\n\nSince then, Robinhood\u2019s crypto business has fallen under regulatory scrutiny, and its transaction revenues from crypto trading have decreased. In August 2022, New York\u2019s top financial regulator fined Robinhood\u2019s crypto unit $30 million. In December 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an investigatory subpoena to the firm regarding its crypto business. And in June, the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase, naming SOL, MATIC, and ADA as unregistered securities in its lawsuits. Robinhood delisted the cryptocurrencies from its exchange shortly afterward.\n\nIts decision to relist SOL, MATIC, and ADA in the EU\u2014as well as other tokens the SEC named as unregistered securities, including SAND, MANA, and ATOM\u2014suggests Robinhood is confident in the European regulatory regime, which passed comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation in April."

        "content": "The Solana Foundation maintains carbon neutrality and for the first time, offset 100% of the network's 2022 carbon footprint through onchain carbon credits\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 6, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Solana Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the Solana network's decentralization, adoption, and security, today released its December 2023 Energy Use Report , underscoring the Foundation's commitment to fostering environmental responsibility and regenerative practices in blockchain technology.\n\nSince the last energy use update in April 2023 , energy use per transaction on the Solana network has declined by 25%, with total emissions from the network decreasing by 17.5%. Even with these significant reductions, the Solana Foundation purchased carbon credits on behalf of the network to offset the network's 2022 emissions, maintaining the Solana network's carbon neutrality. For the first time, the Solana Foundation purchased these offsets entirely onchain.\n\nThe Solana Foundation purchased nearly 11,000 carbon credits from two organizations: ecoToken and Sunrise Stake . The 5000 tons of carbon offsets purchased from ecoToken serve to benefit a variety of different regenerative projects, including City Forest credits in the United States , and the Mataven Forest Unified Indigenous Reserve Project , while the remaining 5,902 tons of carbon offsets from Sunrise Stake fund the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project , which preserves tropical peat swamp forest in Indonesia.\n\n\"At the Solana Foundation, we recognize our responsibility to be good stewards of our planet and create positive change in our industry,\" said Amira Valliani, Head of Policy at the Solana Foundation. \"With this purchase of carbon credits, we have offset 100% of the network's emissions. We're intent on continuing to work with partners across the blockchain industry, NGOs, and governments to drive innovation and solutions for a sustainable future.\"\n\nThis industry-leading achievement in maintaining carbon neutrality is one of many steps for the Solana Foundation in pursuing sustainability and environmental stewardship that sets the precedent for a better future. The Solana Foundation remains committed to tracking network emissions in real-time at SolanaClimate.com , while also pursuing and implementing regenerative programs and procedures that offset the network's carbon output.\n\nThe full Solana Foundation Energy Use Report can be accessed here .\n\nAbout Solana Foundation\n\nThe Solana Foundation is a non-profit foundation based in Zug, Switzerland, dedicated to the decentralization, adoption, and security of the Solana network.

        "content": "Solana was up by more than 7% in the last 24 hours at press time.\n\nSOL\u2019s derivatives metrics looked optimistic and suggested a further price hike.\n\nSolana [SOL] has been under scrutiny ever since FTX announced its plans to liquidate its assets. Recently, a wallet related to FTX made a move that was interesting to look at.\n\nSurprisingly, the move did not have a negative impact on SOL\u2019s price as it\u2019s daily chart remained green.\n\nDoes FTX still have an impact on SOL?\n\nLookonchain recently posted a tweet highlighting an FTX-related wallet\u2019s activity.\n\nAs per the tweet, an FTX-related address unstaked 1.5 million SOL on 5th December 2023, which was worth more than $90 million.\n\nThere was more meat to the story as another wallet deposited tokens worth more than $230 million on Coinbase.\n\n1/ FTX-related address \"4Axqyo\u2026HswTAh\" unstaked 1.5M $SOL($90M) 2 hours ago and transferred it to \"3vxheE\u20265mgkom\". And we noticed that \"3vxheE\u20265mgkom\" deposited 4.13M $SOL($248.67M) to #Coinbase 11 hours ago. pic.twitter.com/pQRNDZCvgy \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2023\n\nAMBCrypto took a look at SOL\u2019s staking ecosystem to see whether the recent transfers had any impact.\n\nAs per our analysis, we found that not much was affected as SOL\u2019s staking ratio continued to remain above 50%. In fact, its staked token trend increased by 90% in the last 24 hours alone.\n\nAs per StakingRewards, Solana had a total of more than 847 thousand staking wallets with an annualized fee revenue of more than $45 million.\n\nAt press time, SOL had a staking market cap of over $24 billion.\n\nHowever, it was interesting to note that the total number of staked SOL did register a decline in the recent past.\n\nSOL stays afloat\n\nDespite a massive sell-off, the token\u2019s price did not react negatively. In fact, the token\u2019s price gained upward momentum.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, SOL was up by more than 6% in just the last 24 hours.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL was trading above $64 with a market capitalization of more than $27.4 billion, making it the sixth largest crypto.\n\nAs per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Solana\u2019s liquidation chart, the token\u2019s price previously witnessed high sell-offs near the $58 mark.\n\nHowever, since the token is now well above that mark, it has to cross another key level.\n\nThe chart clearly revealed that SOL has experienced high liquidations near $66.\n\nTherefore, whether the token manages to go above that mark during this bull rally, it will be interesting to watch.\n\nThings in the derivatives market also looked positive, as SOL\u2019s funding rate registered a spike while its price rose in the past 24 hours.\n\nThis clearly meant that futures investors were actively buying SOL at a higher price.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nNot only that, but its open interest also increased. Whenever open interest increases, it suggests that the on-going price trend will continue.\n\nConsidering these metrics, it\u2019s safe to say that the recent unstaking and sell-off did not have a negative impact on SOL\u2019s overall health."
