        "title": "Connext Labs raises $7.5 million at $250 million valuation to build the 'HTTP of Web3' - Fortune",
        "content": "A central challenge facing crypto is the ever-expanding list of blockchains, with new projects from Sui to Sei popping up even as other layer-1s overstay their welcome.\n\nWhile different developers have sought to create solutions to create compatibility across different blockchains, San Francisco\u2013based Connext Labs argues it has a long-term answer. Investors seem to agree, with Connext announcing a $7.5 million strategic round on Wednesday at a $250 million valuation, with backers including Polychain Capital, NGC Ventures, Polygon Ventures. Connext raised a $12 million series A in 2021.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Fortune, Connext founder Arjun Bhuptani described the project as the \u201cHTTP of Web3,\u201d a reference to the pioneering protocol that enabled the creation of an interconnected World Wide Web.\n\n\u201cThe big narrative in this space has been, \u2018We can use [blockchain] infrastructure to build really amazing public goods, but this infrastructure can\u2019t scale even past really 100,000 people,'\u201d Bhuptani said. \u201cFolks have realized in this space that kind of like the internet itself, the way that we scale blockchains is by actually scaling them out horizontally\u2014so many different blockchains running in parallel.\u201d\n\nHTTP of Web3\n\nConnext facilitates interactions across blockchains. Bhuptani cited different use cases, such as an application like a decentralized exchange wanting to access users across different blockchains, from Bitcoin to Ethereum to Solana, or having copies of applications across different blockchains. He also argued that we will continue to see more specialization of blockchains, such as Filecoin, which is focused on storage, or Sei, which is focused on trading.\n\nOther projects are focused on interweaving blockchains, such as Polkadot\u2014a self-described \u201clayer zero\u201d that undergirds different blockchains\u2014as well the USDC issuer Circle\u2019s new cross-chain transfer protocol.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to build what will eventually be the fabric of the future of what the internet will look like,\u201d Bhuptani said.\n\nWhile he cautioned that Connext is \u201cnot trying to fix everything,\u201d he said the project is different because it\u2019s not aiming to solve the problem on a per-blockchain case, instead leveraging the existing infrastructure of each, rather than trying to build everything in-house. In other words, Connext is providing the protocol rather than the ecosystem.\n\nNext steps\n\nDespite what Bhuptani admitted is a \u201cterrible market,\u201d he said Connext plans to use the new capital to decentralize \u201cmore aggressively\u201d by funding the setup and operation of its foundation, which will also support community-led initiatives.\n\nConnext plans to launch a token later this year. As opposed to other cryptocurrencies, which are generally built on top of a single blockchain with \u201cwrapped\u201d versions then ported over to other blockchains, Bhuptani said he wants the Connext token to be chain-agnostic from the start. Connext is working on a standard for cross-chain tokens that could work across different ecosystems.\n\n\u201cI think we would be the first people pushing toward this model,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nThe main challenge for Connext, and other crypto projects building across blockchains outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum, will be the regulatory challenges in the U.S. After the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s aggressive stance labeling many altcoins as securities in lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance last week, cryptocurrencies such as Solana and Polygon saw their value plummet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this flight to some of those more well-known, well-established chains,\u201d Bhuptani said, but he argued there hasn\u2019t been as much of a transition away from Ethereum-specific scalability solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. \u201cOur collective thesis is just that over time, there is no real option except to have the fragmentation of applications, and users across all of these different ecosystems, and then to tie them together.\u201d"
