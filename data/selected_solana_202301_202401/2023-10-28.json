        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nDuring a recent criminal trial, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the founder of FTX, disclosed that he had started purchasing Solana (SOL) tokens when they were priced at just 20 cents. He also revealed that the funds for this investment came from Alameda\u2019s operating profits and loans from external sources. This revelation contrasted his previous statement, where he had offered to pay $3 per SOL token.\n\nA past Twitter post where SBF had proposed to pay $3 for each Solana token has now resurfaced, going viral across social media platforms. The crypto community quickly points out the aggressive nature of his attempt to acquire SOL tokens.\n\nThe \u201cSam Coin\u201d and its Ties to Bankman-Fried\n\nSolana, sometimes referred to as a \u201cSam Coin\u201d due to its strong ties with SBF, witnessed a rapid rise in popularity and value thanks to significant investments and promotions by him and his firms. However, the collapse of FTX in November raised questions about the sustainability of SOL\u2019s price. The Solana ecosystem was significantly affected by the collapse of the exchange, with the blockchain community striving to overcome the impact ever since.\n\nAlso Read: Sam Bankman-Fried Breaks His Silence in a Tense Courtroom Drama: Here\u2019s What Happened\n\nObjections from Federal Prosecutor and the Behavior of SBF\n\nDuring the trial, federal prosecutor Danielle Sassoon objected to Bankman-Fried\u2019s evidence, an attempt by defense attorney Mark Cohen to show that SBF had exercised due diligence in transactions made while operating FTX and Alameda. Observers also noted the contrasting behavior of SBF during the trial. He appeared well-prepared and composed when answering questions from his defense attorneys but seemed nervous and stumbled when questioned by the prosecuting attorney from the Department of Justice regarding the alleged wire fraud.\n\nIn conclusion, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s past investments and ties to Solana have been scrutinized during his recent criminal trial, revealing a complex web of transactions and relationships that have now come to the forefront. The crypto community continues to watch the trial closely, as the outcome will likely have significant implications for the future of Solana and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem."

        "content": "A widely-followed crypto analyst says the Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) is on the verge of another breakout that will outperform ETH and Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 225,000 followers on the social media platform X that SOL is one of his main \u201calt picks\u201d and is set to run higher not only in USD terms but also versus BTC (SOL/BTC) and ETH (SOL/ETH).\n\n\u201cSOL still one of my favorite alt picks right now.\n\nStructure on the USD pair looks very much impulsive and like an extended wave three underway and its BTC and ETH pair also still look like they are on the cusp of high timeframe accumulation breakouts.\u201d\n\nBluntz utilizes the Elliot Wave Theory in his technical analysis. The theory aims to predict price impulses based on crowd psychology, which tends to manifest in waves. Based on his chart, the analyst suggests that SOL is in the midst of a five-wave impulse to the upside that could top out near the $47 range before making its next move.\n\nWhen asked why he\u2019s so zeroed in on Solana, Bluntz says he\u2019s confident that SOL will outperform BTC and ETH in the near future.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin, the trader says that BTC\u2019s price action strongly suggests that more upside action is imminent and that a dip to $32,000 is unlikely at this point. He forecasts that BTC will make another impulse upward after consolidating within a bullish triangle pattern.\n\n\u201cThe fact that BTC is showing acceptance at these levels after that strong breakout of $32,000 is quite bullish in my opinion.\n\nI don\u2019t think we retest $32,000 at all, too many people missed the move and want that retest and I don\u2019t think the market will give it to them.\n\nI anticipate this to probably end up as a triangle and break higher.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $33,957.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Asset management firm VanEck believes Solana could see a 10,000% growth in value by 2030 if the blockchain attracts 100 million users, according to a new research report.\n\nThe most striking prediction from the report suggests that SOL could experience a 10,600% price rally by the year 2030, potentially reaching $3,211.28 per token. Comparatively, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) 2030 target price is set at $11,800.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as Solana\u2019s native SOL token has surged above the $32 mark this week, capturing the attention of both investors and experts.\n\n100M users\n\nVanEck\u2019s research presents a wide range of valuation scenarios for SOL by the year 2030, projecting prices that span from a bearish $9.81 to a bullish $3,211.28 based on projections influenced by various market factors and revenue estimates across key sectors.\n\nThe report highlights a scenario in which Solana becomes the first blockchain to host an application capable of onboarding over 100 million users.\n\nUnder the scenario, VanEck assumes that SOL monetizes at only 20% of ETH\u2019s take rate and attains less than half of the rival\u2019s market share due to differing community philosophies.\n\nDespite these limitations, the asset manager believes there is a credible path for SOL token holders to generate a staggering $8 billion in revenues by 2030 if it hits that level of adoption.\n\nCurrently, SOL stands tall as one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, having recorded impressive growth of over 200% since the start of 2023. The Solana ecosystem has roughly $378 million in total value locked as of press time.\n\nKiller app\n\nSolana\u2019s approach to blockchain development centers on usability \u2014 a critical factor in determining the success of a blockchain in hosting the next \u201ckiller app.\u201d\n\nWhile the user base of most blockchains remains relatively small compared to mainstream platforms like Facebook and PayPal, Solana aims to bridge this gap by offering a more efficient and user-friendly experience.\n\nTo achieve this, Solana has focused on enhancing its data throughput capacity, surpassing any other existing blockchain and promising even more significant improvements in the near future.\n\nThe report points out that Solana\u2019s data throughput capabilities translate into quicker transaction processing, significantly outperforming Ethereum in terms of speed.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s transaction processing occurs at discrete intervals, Solana starts processing transactions instantly, resulting in turnaround times of approximately 2 seconds. This superior speed and efficiency are crucial for attracting users to the platform.\n\nThe report also draws a stark contrast between Solana\u2019s philosophy and that of ETH.\n\nSolana, founded by Qualcomm engineers, emphasizes making blockspace inexpensive and user-friendly, with a vision of promoting abundant technological progress. Comparatively, ETH has shifted its focus from selling cheap blockspace daily to securing consumer-facing blockchains with expensive blockspace.\n\nChallenges\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s approach has led to impressive technological advancements, it has not been without its challenges.\n\nThe report noted that while Solana generates revenue from transaction fees, it also incurs significant costs to secure its blockchain through SOL inflation payments to validators.\n\nIn the short term, Solana\u2019s profitability may not be a concern, but ensuring organic SOL demand to cover security costs remains a long-term challenge.\n\nMoreover, Solana\u2019s pricing model, which depends on resource pricing and congestion, could be problematic as more blockchains compete for specific use cases. The report suggests that if SOL prices weaken, Solana\u2019s ability to sustain its current state might depend on the continuous influx of speculative capital.\n\nAdditionally, the report highlights Solana\u2019s technical stability issues, citing unpredictable downtimes in the past due to the experimental nature of the system.\n\nWhile Solana has made improvements to mitigate these issues, its complex design and colossal data volumes make it difficult to predict and resolve future complications, potentially affecting its uptime and attractiveness to businesses.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Is It Too Late to Buy Solana? SOL Price Gains 38% as New Crypto Casino Project Makes Waves in the Community\n\nSolana is on the climb as crypto markets flip bullish, but as SOL sits atop a 38% price gain, could Bitcoin retracement trigger downside? Or, is Solana set to breakout?\n\nPrice action is in an ongoing battle to secure a foothold at freshly reclaimed support around $32.25, yet, this comes as a challenging time for the Solana network.\n\nman even with the rally, and measuring it in SOL, there is just no value locked/activity on Solana right now need stuff to start shipping in the next 6 months pic.twitter.com/2B4eT5QwKy \u2014 blockgraze\ud83d\udc02\ud83c\udfaf (@blockgraze) October 26, 2023\n\nBest visualised through total value locked (TVL) which has undertaken a substantial decline over the past year \u2013 in a demonstration of fleeting network activity.\n\nSOL Price Analysis: Is it Too Late to Buy Solana After +38% Price Pump?\n\n\n\nAs price fights to consolidate, Solana is currently trading at a market price of $32.16 (representing a 24-hour change of -0.76%).\n\nThis comes as the +38% rally move topped out at localised resistance around $34 \u2013 a price level untouched since July 13.\n\nLower support can now be found at the $30 mark, giving much needed reassurance to Solana bulls awaiting a bullish pendant breakout.\n\nThe rapidly ascendant 20DMA is currently stood at $25.45 \u2013 far beneath ongoing price action.\n\nHowever, the RSI indicator is emerging as a cause for concern, having now been overheated at an overbought signal for 7-days.\n\nThis suggests the potential need for a consolidation or retracement move before price can push up higher.\n\nYet, the bullish sentiment of markets remains reflected in the MACD \u2013 which is stood with bullish divergence at 0.834.\n\nOverall, Solana looks strong here, with 4-days at current price levels and nearby localised support, further consolidation could trigger a breakout of the current bullish pendant.\n\nThis leaves Solana with an upside target at $34.45 (a possible +7%).\n\nWhile downside risk remains at $30.20 (A potential -6.21%).\n\nSolana therefore carries a short-time frame risk: reward ratio of 1.13 \u2013 a reasonable entry with slightly more reward on the table.\n\nIn other news, the TG Casino presale has broken out as traders rush to find the next Rollbit-style gambleFi moon-shot.\n\nTop Rollbit Alternative?

        "title": "Solana Vs Ethereum: A Deep-Dive Analysis of Two Popular Coins - CoinGape",
        "content": "In the crypto world, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) are two of the most popular crypto coins that have found use cases across the board. While both projects share many similarities, there are still major differences between them. Understanding the key differences between SOL and ETH can help investors and traders make informed decisions to maximize their investments. But what factors should one take into consideration when doing a Solana vs Ethereum analysis? Here, we deep dive into the key aspects that differentiate SOL from ETH and vice versa.\n\nAbout Solana\n\nSolana, or SOL, was created by software developer Anatoly Yakovenko, who first proposed the project in 2017 and finally launched it in 2020. The coin takes inspiration from Etherum and was eventually created to improve upon Etherum. Many crypto enthusiasts and experts considered Solana a potential \u2018Ethereum killer.\u2019\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana emerged as a new-generation crypto coin that addressed several shortcomings of popular tokens launched before it. The coin\u2019s transactions are conducted on the Solana blockchain, which uses a proof-of-history consensus mechanism instead of a proof-of-work mechanism used by popular initial coins like Bitcoin.\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, the proof-of-work mechanism depends on miners to unearth the next block and is slow and has a high energy demand. In comparison, the proof-of-history consensus mechanism is fast and requires 99.9% less energy. This is one of the main reasons why Solana took on the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum right from the beginning.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum, or ETH, which was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in his white paper in 2013, was finally launched in 2015. Buterin was joined by Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Anthony Di Iorio, Jeffrey Wilcke, Joseph Lubin, and Mihai Alisie, who further developed and popularised the project its way to the second-largest blockchain project in the world, only behind Bitcoin.\n\nETH is the native currency of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain that offers smart contract functionality. However, the project was also plagued with issues related to proof-of-work until September 2022, when it shifted to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The move helped it become more fast and reduced its energy needs by over 99%, making it more efficient.\n\nSolana Vs. Ethereum : An Overview\n\nSolana and Ethereum are two of the most widely used crypto tokens globally. But to better understand how these two crypto coins are pitting against each other, we have taken several factors into consideration to provide you with a detailed snapshot.\n\nGoogle Trends: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nGoogle Trends is one of the key metrics to determine the interest of crypto enthusiasts in particular coins. For the past 12 months in 2023, Ethereum clearly has the edge over Solana in terms of search volumes and interest of the global crypto community.\n\nCaption: Interest over time of Solana and Ethereum {Solana (Blue); Ethereum (Red)}\n\nActive Addresses: Solana Vs. Ethereum\n\nActive Addresses is another important metric that can give you an insight into the adoption of a coin. In simple terms, an active address is a crypto address that has become a direct participant in a successful transaction. It can be either the sender\u2019s or receiver\u2019s address.\n\nActive Addresses Solana\n\nSolana\u2019s active addresses, which peaked at around 39.64 million in April 2022, are nowhere close to its days of glory. However, the token has witnessed a decent rise in active addresses in the last 30 days. In October 2023, active addresses on Solana stood at 5.33 million as of 28 October.\n\nActive Addresses Ethereum\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Ethereum is a more popular crypto coin than Solana. Therefore, naturally, the former has a more stable number of active addresses than the latter. In October, Ethereum\u2019s number of active addresses was 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nMonthly Transactions (Solana & Ethereum)\n\nMonthly transactions in crypto refer to the buying, selling, and exchanging of digital currencies within a given month. Comparing Ethereum and Solana\u2019s monthly transactions will help you understand which coin is being preferred for transactions by crypto enthusiasts.\n\nSolana Monthly Transactions\n\nNon-vote Solana transactions peaked in November 2021 at 1.5 billion. The last time it was near the 1 billion mark was in July 2022. The number of non-vote transactions has kept fluctuating since then. In October, the number of non-vote transactions showed improvement. As of 28 October, the number of non-vote transactions was up at 550.4 million from 494.7 million in September and 519.83 million in August 2023.\n\nEthereum Monthly Transactions\n\nIn terms of monthly transactions, Ethereum made a record in May 2021, when the token was involved in 20.27 transactions. While ETH\u2019s number of transactions has fallen since then, it has remained stable in the range of 12 million to 17 million. However, in October, the number of Ethereum-based transactions could see a serious fall as it stands at 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nAlso Read : Shiba Inu Vs Dogecoin : A Deep Dive Into The Ecosystem\n\nPrice Chart: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nAnalyzing and comparing Solana and Ethereum price charts can provide key insights that can help in making informed decisions. CoinGape price comparison chart above demonstrates price trend and market performances of both Solana and Ethereum. While Ethereum price is up by over 85%, Solana price is surging significantly by more than 450% as of December 2023 in the last 12 months.\n\nMarket Cap & Trading Volume: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nThe market cap of cryptocurrencies gives an indication of the coin\u2019s value and size. Ethereum, being the more popular crypto coin, clearly has a higher market cap of over $284 billion while Solana has a market cap of $32billion. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply at present stands at 120.2 million and that of Solana\u2019s is at 425.9 million.\n\nComing to the trading volume of both the cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s trading volume stands at over $12 billion with a decrease of 23% in the last 24 hours as of December 9, 2023. And, Solana\u2019s trading volume is more than $3 billion and is down by 21% in the last 24 hours.\n\nConclusion : Which coin is more popular ?\n\nEthereum and Solana are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in today\u2019s time. Both the coins have found several use cases, and are witnessing an increased adoption in multiple areas. At present, with a larger market cap and higher active addresses, it\u2019s clear that Ethereum is finding more traction among crypto users. However, Solana, which faced a massive setback after its links with FTX were found, is gaining the lost ground, and could soon again give a tough competition to Ethereum. In all likelihood, it\u2019s going to be more interesting from here. Stay tuned!"
