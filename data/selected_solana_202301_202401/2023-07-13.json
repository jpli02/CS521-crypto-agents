Notably, asset management giant BlackRock, which is at the forefront of the push to register a spot bitcoin ETF, is a large proponent of ESG-focused investments."

        "content": "Thu 13 Jul 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nSolana (SOL) is currently not at its best in the crypto market. However, some analysts believe this is just temporary.\n\nRaoul Pal expects Solana (SOL) to reach 20 times its current price\n\nSolana (SOL) is currently experiencing a period of mixed growth. It is currently worth around $22.04 on the market, up 5.58% over the last 24 hours. The asset\u2019s performance may not be Olympic, but it could be much better.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what Raoul Pal has in mind. Indeed, the CEO of Real Vision is particularly optimistic about the crypto\u2019s price prospects. According to his forecasts, it could reach 20 times its current price, or around $440.\n\nGiven current market conditions, this seems a surreal projection. If Raoul Pal believes it, it\u2019s for a number of reasons. In particular, he notes that Solana has gained around 10% in valuation over the past week.\n\nThis represents around 43% over the last 30 days. In other words, the signals are favorable for Solana. At least, enough, the analyst believes, for the crypto to replicate a similar dynamic achieved by Ethereum (ETH) in 2018.\n\nAfter bottoming out that year, the crypto had accomplished a surge taking it to over $4,800. This breakthrough represented just over 47 times the asset\u2019s lowest value.\n\nIt\u2019s not certain that Solana will make a similar move. Nevertheless, Raoul Pal believes that the crypto is following in ETH\u2019s footsteps. A trend confirmed by its fall to $9 in 2022, its lowest level.\n\n\u201cLook\u2026 There\u2019s a possibility that Solana will do what ETH did from the 2018 low, which was a 47x. Solana\u2019s low was $9, so you can do the math, the numbers are potentially very interesting,\u201d concludes the specialist.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFollowing a U.S. federal judge\u2019s ruling that XRP\u2014the token powering the Ripple network\u2014is not a security in certain contexts, a sea of green has emerged across popular altcoins, with top coins up double-digit percentages over the past 24 hours.\n\nXRP itself is up a colossal 62% as of writing upon the news\u2013which has seen an uproar from the self-proclaimed \u201cXRP army\u201d all throughout Twitter\u2014trading above $0.76, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nSelect other altcoins, some of which were previously deemed securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have also benefited from the rising tide. Solana (SOL) has roared upwards with a 17% gain on the day, marking a sizable 32% increase on the week, changing hands at around $26, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum scaling network Polygon (MATIC), which made news last week for a restructuring in its executive team, has also had a favorable day, notching an 16% gain, trading at $0.84 on the day\u2014showcasing a bullish 27% candle on the week.\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is changing hands above $0.32 on the day, which translates into a nearly 13% daily gain\u2014along with Stellar Lumens (XLM), which has clocked a massive 35% gain on the day, currently trading above $0.13.\n\nUpon readings from CoinGecko, several other cryptocurrencies that were also called securities by the SEC\u2014arbitrarily so, in the view of former SEC Cyber Chief Robert Cohen\u2014have also had exceptional months. However, their respective gains are not as vast as the above tokens over the past 24 hours.\n\nAlthough Filecoin (FIL) has seen a comparatively mild 6% gain today, the month has been very positive, with a 25% increase in its current market value, which sits at $4.55. Cosmos Hub (ATOM) follows suit, showcasing a green 6% candle on the day, and a nearly 12% gain over the past 30 days. According to CoinGecko, it\u2019s trading above $9.60.\n\nAnalysts hailed the judge\u2019s decision as a positive one for the broader crypto space, providing clarity to investors and builders alike. That said, while the ruling suggested that XRP should not be considered a security in certain contexts, the matter is not yet fully resolved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe judgments today are a huge step forward for the industry,\u201d Chris Martin, head of research at Amberdata, told Decrypt. \u201cFirst, by judging that XRP is not a security, we're starting to get clarity on what constitutes a security and what constitutes a commodity.\"\n\nHe told Decrypt that \u201cthe SEC will have to revise their tactics on several of their ongoing cases, and I expect that this judgment will implicate several other tokens as non-securities.\u201d\n\nCory Klippstein, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, did have some words of caution, despite the cheering of Crypto Twitter today.\n\n\u201cThe judge declined to deliver summary judgment on the question of whether programmatic sales of XRP via exchanges constituted the sale of securities, meaning that this question will be litigated further,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nKlippstein added that he believes \u201csecondary trading of altcoins on exchanges will be given a pass, and that this is consistent with the laws on the books.\u201d"

        "content": "Summer is back and so are all the fun activities and camps along San Diego\u2019s scenic beaches. Seven- to 16-year-olds who share a love for the beach join another Solana Beach Junior Lifeguard (SBJL) summer camp weekdays in the mornings and/or afternoons for two weeks. In their red swimsuits and white rash guards splashing against ocean blue waters, they are making life-lasting memories and new friendships. They adventure while exercising on land and in the water, learning safety and lifesaving skills with some of the most experienced lifeguards.\n\nMarine Safety Sergeant Evan Mason, 31, found his start at SBJL camp at the age of 10. Over four years, he completed eight weeks of the summer camp which then led and inspired him to become an intern at the age of 16. After five years of lifeguard experience, he became a senior lifeguard and eventually a certified sergeant. Mason also worked as a state park lifeguard in Cardiff, Carlsbad and Torrey Pines state beaches and subsequently became a state park peace officer, lifeguard in Malibu before returning to Solana Beach for a sergeant position. He is now working full-time at the Solana Beach lifeguard headquarters, training young ocean lovers and saving lives not only on the beach but also wherever emergency calls for it. When asked what he likes the most about working in Solana Beach, he answered \u201cBonding with other lifeguards, we are like a family here.\u201d\n\nMarine Safety Sergeant Evan Mason\n\n(Marzena Poniatowska)\n\nSome instructors, such as Brian Applegate, Cooper Mortimer, and Sage Bolaris bring their actual family on board to participate in the program or become one of the assistant instructors. It\u2019s a very young, fun and vibrant environment. Russ Schutz, one of the senior lifeguards since 1986 who still participates in the program and trains junior lifeguards, was the lead singer in the local band Skanic. He can be found playing in a new band called Mr. Hand on local stages in North County.\n\nAnother young lifeguard and SBJL instructor is Emma Hart who broke a state record in the women\u2019s 100 and 200 meter butterfly this year.\n\nThe mission of the SBJL program is to provide a safe and fun environment where participants learn about lifeguarding, safety, the beaches, the ocean, and coastal bluffs. The objective is to build confidence, skill and endurance in kids through training, education, exercise, and activities. SBJL fosters a sense of community, mutual respect and building self-esteem among the kids who keep coming back year after year.\n\n2023 SBJL beach and land practice and games.\n\n(Marzena Poniatowska)\n\nWhen 10-year-old Annabelle Reynolds, who completed her second year as a SBJL this summer, was asked why she travels all the way from Illinois to participate in this program, she responded \u201cI love how fun the camp is, we socialize, play, make new friends, and at the same time learn and practice ocean safety.\u201d\n\nVivian Oldakowski, one of the 7-year-old students from the youngest group \u201cGroms,\u201d said, \u201cI love everything about this camp, I want to come back again and again so that I can save lives soon.\u201d Her 11-year-old sister and a junior lifeguard Sofia said, \u201cThe best part of being a lifeguard is the responsibility that allows others to feel safe with us is so rewarding.\u201d\n\nAs the waters get warmer every year and the sea levels rise, it is important that beach goers swim in front of an open lifeguard tower and stay clear of all bluffs overhangs and caves."
