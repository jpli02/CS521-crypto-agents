        "content": "Solana is a popular blockchain that supports decentralized applications and tokens. Launched in 2020, the network is frequently pitched as a leading alternative to the high fees and slow transaction times that have sometimes plagued market leader Ethereum. Solana claims to be capable of processing transactions 4,000 times faster than Ethereum.\n\nThose pitches are often made by venture capitalists, who flooded the project, helmed by former Qualcomm employee Anatoly Yakovenko, with over $300 million in 2021. The cash jolt helped Solana\u2019s native currency, SOL, rise to highs of $78 billion in June of that year.\n\nSolana has since its inception relied on the environmentally-friendly proof-of-stake technique to verify transactions on its blockchain and, like Ethereum, users pay transaction fees in its native currency.\n\nSolana is not compatible with popular Ethereum wallets like MetaMask, and instead relies on its own network of wallet makers. Popular choices include Solflare and Phantom. It also has a lively NFT scene, hosting projects like Solana Monkey Business and the Degenerate Ape Academy.\n\nSolana\u2019s market cap lags behind Ethereum by several hundred billion dollars, and its price is far more volatile. Most of the venture capitalists and investors that boosted the coin in the bull run of 2021 went quiet while its market cap fell from $78 billion in June of that year to $13 billion a year later.\n\nThe blockchain also suffered several crashes and outages that shut down the blockchain for hours at a time. A bug in June 2022 brought down the blockchain for four hours, and in September 2021 a popular DeFi protocol switched off the network for almost 18 hours.\n\nSolana took a bigger hit than most other cryptocurrencies following the November 2022 collapse of FTX because many people regarded the project as intertwined with the exchange\u2019s disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Since then, Solana\u2019s founders have stated repeatedly that the blockchain can flourish on its own. By mid-2023, Solana appears to have largely recovered from the scandal, and its token price has climbed.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nSolana white paper\u2014Anatoly Yakovenko\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat is DeFi?\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nSolscan\u2014Solana\u2019s blockchain explorer\n\nPhantom\u2014A popular Solana wallet"

Screenings cost $10 with discounts for service members and vets. The fest concludes Saturday with the sold-out Awards Celebration.\n\nThe 11th annual San Diego Fringe Festival continues with a promise to bring \u201cthe beautiful, the bizarre and the unexpected\u201d to fans. Segments include \u201cFamily Fringe\u201d and \u201cStreet Theatre.\u201d Performances include comedy, musicals, physical theater and more. The fest, mostly at Balboa Park, runs through May 28. Passes start at $27 for three shows, with 10-show passes available.\n\nFiesta del Sol, Solana Beach\u2019s free music festival, opens Saturday at Fletcher Cove. The English Beat, The Fabba Show and Betamaxx lead the slate on day one, with Iya Terra and Ginger Roots and the Protectors the headliners on Sunday.

        "title": "Can Solana (SOL-USD) Go on Another Bull Run Without FTX? - TipRanks.com - TipRanks",
        "content": "The Solana ecosystem and its star token SOL (SOL-USD) has seen its bull run hit particularly hard by one of the largest frauds in the cryptocurrency space \u2014 the November 2022 collapse of the FTX exchange, caused by extreme mismanagement of customer funds.\n\nThis is because FTX was among the largest sponsors of the Solana ecosystem, with the exchange and its infamous hedge fund arm Alameda Research being involved in funding the ecosystem, supporting liquidity, and even backing many of the bridged assets on Solana (tokens from other blockchains \u201cwrapped\u201d so that they could be used on Solana).\n\nJust to list a few concrete examples, FTX was the primary \u201cbridge\u201d to bring assets such as USD Coin (USDC-USD), Bitcoin (BTC-USD), and Ethereum (ETH-USD). Thankfully, the former eventually gained enough traction to have a native Solana version issued by USDC\u2019s creator, Circle, which helped reduce the magnitude of the eventual impact.\n\nSerum, a decentralized exchange backed by FTX, was shut down in the wake of the FTX collapse. The platform was the backbone of Solana during its heyday, with many other decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges drawing liquidity from it as well.\n\nOverall, the impact of the FTX collapse was immense. From $1 billion in total value locked (TVL), a measure of the value of the assets placed in Solana apps, the ecosystem crashed to just over $200 million. What\u2019s more worrying, even amid a broader market recovery since the lows of 2022, TVL remained largely flat on Solana.\n\nTechnical Woes Add Fuel to the Uncertainty\n\nA further issue that\u2019s haunted Solana since before the FTX debacle is the frequent chain halting. Normally, blockchains are supposed to be impossible to stop; at worst, fees will skyrocket to levels where only the most determined users will still be interested in using the chain.\n\nSolana initially didn\u2019t quite have a fee market like other blockchains, so when demand for transactions outstripped supply, the network simply stopped. When that was changed in mid-2022, other bugs caused halting. The last chain halt was in February 2023, and since then, no more episodes have been reported, according to the Solana uptime page.\n\nHowever, the reputational damage is done. The chain has stopped 10 times in its history, often for many hours at a time \u2014 an unacceptable record in the blockchain space. Reliable uptime is one of the pillars of a healthy DeFi ecosystem, and Solana arguably lost a lot of trust from developers and users alike in the past 12 months. It\u2019ll be some time before the community forgets about these episodes, which hopefully will not be happening again from now on.\n\nIf these issues are solved, then Solana remains an excellent alternative for deploying decentralized apps. With extremely low fees and high throughput, thanks to a number of optimizations to the underlying transaction processing, the Solana blockchain is a valid contender in the race for blockchain adoption.\n\nThe question now is, where will this next wave be coming from, and how is Solana positioning itself to take advantage of it?\n\nDespite Everything, Solana is Still Keeping Up\n\nThe overall market slowdown in 2022 has impacted the entire space. Old narratives, such as the NFT mania, quieted down, and precious few new alternatives have emerged since. Thankfully, Solana has been keeping up with the new up-and-coming trends in blockchain.\n\nOne of these trends is so-called LSDs or Liquid Staking Derivatives. These are token wrappers representing an underlying amount of staked assets, or SOL in this case. They are useful because holders can gain access to nearly the full value of their assets just by selling LSDs or using them in DeFi, while still receiving a staking yield at all times.\n\nLSD protocols like Marinade Finance and Lido have quickly gained market share and are now the top protocols by TVL, keeping the ecosystem visible in the overall charts.\n\nEven meme coins like BONK had a good run on Solana, arguably starting the meme coin \u201ctrend\u201d (however long it may last). There are also solid upticks in DeFi and NFT activity, with key partnerships such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) delivering on their promise, according to Messari.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible not to mention the Solana Saga, the platform\u2019s own Android flagship device, which has recently shipped. Though the idea is certainly out of the ordinary, reviewers seem to be praising the phone as well-made and tastefully integrated with Web3 features.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a very good sign on the development front: activity hasn\u2019t slowed down significantly in numbers, despite the chain issues from the past.\n\nThis is a great sign for things to come: the next killer app of blockchain is still out there, and as it stands, it looks like Solana is in a position to be there when it comes. If that happens, SOL should easily follow along, thanks to the LSDs and the new fee model.\n\nSo despite the massive crash and tough challenges, rumors of Solana\u2019s demise may be greatly exaggerated. The chain has managed to retain a core set of loyal developers and users, which are keeping it relevant, even if still far away from previous heights. The future may still be quite bright for the ecosystem, even if it will likely need more time to recover.\n\nDisclosure"
