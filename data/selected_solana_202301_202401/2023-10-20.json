        "content": "Jonah \u2014 a popular Twitter account of a pseudonymous crypto trader \u2014 made waves this week with a scathing Twitter thread explaining why he believes Solana\u2019s future prospects look grim.\n\nIn his Oct. 18 tweet, Jonah kicked off the thread by claiming Solana has a \u201cstructural oversupply of blockspace\u201d and its speed advantage won\u2019t matter for years. He went on to criticize Solana\u2019s ties to FTX, Jump Trading, and Multicoin Capital, suggesting their plan to \u201cwatch your transactions and systematically frontrun them\u201d is a major red flag.\n\nFurther, Jonah argued decentralization is critical in crypto and centralized entities like FTX cannot be trusted, especially after recent events. He predicted developers will avoid building on Solana while FTX dumps tokens, stifling innovation.\n\nYou might also like: Lido Finance to stop Solana support while Cardano prices fall, new project unveils staking program\n\nTechnologically, Jonah believes Solana\u2019s approach is \u201cfundamentally ill-suited to the problem it is trying to solve.\u201d He pointed out it still struggles with basic applications like StepN, showing vertical scaling doesn\u2019t work for crypto like horizontal scaling does.\n\nFinally, Jonah claimed leadership at Jump Trading is now \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d and can no longer pretend to support Solana infrastructure, for which there is little end user demand anyway.\n\nThe thread struck a chord with many crypto users who agree Solana faces structural challenges. With its monopoly on speed now being a distant memory and key backers facing trust issues, Solana may struggle to attract developers and users long-term if it doesn\u2019t adapt its strategy."

        "content": "Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal believes Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) will usher in a \u201ccrypto summer\u201d next year.\n\nThe macroeconomic expert tells his 996,800 followers on the social media platform X that Solana is forming a classic bullish pattern that could eventually lead to a more than 86% increase from its current value.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, but it feels like SOL is going to lead us from \u2018crypto spring\u2019 eventually into \u2018crypto summer\u2019 in 2024.\u201d\n\nA \u201ccrypto summer\u201d generally means increased prices, higher trading volume, bullish market sentiment, more network development and wider adoption.\n\nThe trader says SOL appears to be completing an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a bullish indicator that could send SOL to the $30 level before a move to $50.\n\n\u201cSOL: I\u2019ve been extremely bullish all year. It\u2019s up 171% this year and we are about to test the big inverse head and shoulders at $30. Next major resistance would likely be $50, once confirmed.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader is looking for SOL to break out of the $26.79 level, flipping it into support, to maintain the possible bullish reversal.\n\nThe trader also says that Solana is showing strength against Ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt has broken out versus ETH.\u201d\n\nThe SOL/ETH pair is trading for 0.0167 ETH ($26.84) at time of writing.\n\nSolana is making gains against against Bitcoin (BTC) as well.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe world of cryptocurrencies is vast, with a plethora of assets vying for the spotlight. For a long time, Ethereum (ETH) has held a revered position, initially beginning as a nonconsensus asset back in 2018 and 2019. Fast forward to today, and Ethereum has garnered consensus, solidifying its position as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the tides of the crypto world are ever-changing, and a new contender is making waves \u2014 Solana (SOL). Prominent crypto analysts now claim that Solana is the \"strongest non-consensus asset\" of the current bear market. Such bold claims are not made lightly, and the recent performance of Solana provides substantial backing to these assertions.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nExamining the daily chart of Solana reveals an explosive trajectory. After a series of oscillations, SOL has demonstrated a robust upward trend, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. Peaks and troughs aside, the general momentum of Solana portrays bullish sentiment.\n\nBut what sets Solana apart in the crowded crypto domain? One key event solidifying its credibility was its resilience during the FTX crash. FTX, a prominent crypto exchange, was one of the major holders of Solana. Despite potential concerns of market manipulation or undue influence, Solana showcased stability and growth even after the FTX crash. This event not only fortified investor confidence but also indicated Solana's intrinsic value and potential for longevity in the crypto arena.\n\nNow, Solana stands in an advantageous position. The so-called shackles of major centralized holders are behind, and the ecosystem of Solana is burgeoning. Developers, start-ups and enterprises are increasingly turning to Solana's blockchain for its speed, security and scalability."

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt was a good week for holders of virtually all leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP.\n\nAfter many weeks of inertia and slow movement, Bitcoin (BTC) finally rebounded with some bullish price action, adding 10% over the last seven days to change hands at $29,523 as of this writing. The rest of the market rebounded with it.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally began on Monday, following last Friday\u2019s news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would not be appealing a court verdict that labeled the regulator\u2019s rejection of crypto asset manager Grayscale\u2019s ETF application \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency also received another boost\u2014of around 10%\u2014on Monday when Cointelegraph tweeted fake news that Wall Street titan Blackrock had been approved to launch a U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink responded to the price pump that day, saying during an appearance on FOX Business: \u201cIt\u2019s just an example of the pent-up interest in crypto. I think the rally today is about a flight to quality.\u201d A marked change of tune from 2017 when Fink called Bitcoin an \u201cindex of money laundering.\u201d\n\nLater in the week, BlackRock submitted an amended prospectus for its ETF application. Changes to its filing include acknowledgment of competition in the race for ETF approval and detailed explanations on the product\u2019s pricing and reporting mechanisms. On a related note, a report released by JP Morgan that day (Wednesday) called it \u201cmost likely\u201d that a spot Bitcoin ETF could get approved before January 10.\n\nBy Friday, the news had pushed Bitcoin\u2019s price to briefly reclaim $30k, a level not seen since summer, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe wider market: Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash\n\nWhile Bitcoin generally acts as the industry\u2019s pace-setter (typically when BTC rises, other coins and tokens rise with it), this week, the market leader\u2019s gains were far outpaced by some of its rivals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClosest contender Ethereum (ETH) didn\u2019t manage to catch up with it this week. Ethereum rose 3.4% to enter the weekend trading at $1.602.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP blew up this week, but not quite as much as Bitcoin. XRP grew 6.7% to $0.515669 off the back of news that the SEC had voluntarily dismissed charges against Ripple execs, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen. The SEC sued them alongside the company in December 2020 for allegedly violating securities laws with sales of XRP.\n\nThe biggest rallies this week came from two altcoins: Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Cash blew up 11.6% and currently trades at $239.40, while Solana mushroomed a staggering 25% to hit $26.89 at the time of writing.\n\nSOL\u2019s impressive rally appears to have been spurred by news that the FTX estate has decided to stake roughly $122 million in Solana held in the bankrupt exchange's crypto wallets rather than liquidate it.\n\nFinally, there were no significant losses among the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The only red candle this week was from Cosmos Hub\u2019s ATOM, which fell 3.8% to $6.36.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."
