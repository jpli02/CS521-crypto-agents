        "title": "Why It Makes Sense to Buy Solana Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After losing 94% of its value in 2022, Solana seems poised for a major rebound in 2023.\n\nSolana (SOL -0.13%) continues to be one of the surprise breakout performers of early 2023. Over the first week of the year, Solana is up a jaw-dropping 33.58%. That's quite a rebound for a crypto that was down nearly 94% in 2022. The big question, of course, is whether Solana can keep up this momentum throughout the rest of the year.\n\nThere are two key reasons why I think Solana can actually turn things around in 2023 after what turned out to be an absolutely miserable 2022.\n\nExtreme value\n\nFirst and most importantly, Solana has become an extreme value play in the crypto market. It's one thing for a silly meme coin to lose 94% of its value in one year; it's another thing entirely for a Layer 1 blockchain network once touted as \"the next Ethereum\" to lose 94% of its value so quickly. Right now, investors are basically saying Solana is worthless, which seems hard to believe. Solana is not just a cryptocurrency -- it is also a platform for decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain gaming, and the metaverse.\n\nWhile a few big names in the NFT world appear to be abandoning Solana right now, there is a lot to like about this crypto. For one, Solana is now the second-leading player in the NFT marketplace, and its performance in this key area has held up well, even in the face of the FTX (FTT) market meltdown. Moreover, according to crypto research firm Messari, the underlying fundamentals at Solana -- as measured by user base, network stability, and transaction activity -- were actually showing signs of growing strength heading into the final quarter of 2022, which is when the FTX drama started.\n\nFrom my perspective, Solana has been unfairly punished for its links to FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. As soon as investors found out that he had promoted and financed Solana, the crypto went into free fall before finally stabilizing around the $10 level at the end of the year. In 2023, I think much of this stigma is going to fade away, and investors can get back to valuing Solana based on its underlying fundamentals.\n\nGrowth in the Solana ecosystem\n\nAnother key point to keep in mind is the overall Solana ecosystem. This includes NFTs minted on the Solana blockchain, the overall Solana developer community, and all of the projects and decentralized apps built on Solana. This Solana ecosystem is incredibly vibrant, and Solana took extensive efforts to reassure its developers throughout December that the network was not going away. There is also an extensive global tour known as Solana Hacker House planned for 2023. In 2022, this tour hit 24 cities worldwide and involved 12,000 developers.\n\nWhile it can be difficult to gauge overall investor sentiment about Solana, the recent viral success of Bonk (BONK), the first-ever Solana meme coin, shows how the Solana developer community appears to be rallying around Solana this year. The meme coin has gone from being a small token of appreciation to members of the Solana community to being a story picked up by the mainstream media as proof of Solana's resurgence. The sudden buzz around Solana is what led to the crypto's early standout performance in January.\n\nAnd, finally, don't forget about all the projects on tap at Solana for 2023. The big project to keep an eye on is the formal launch of Solana Mobile, which showcases the world's first-ever crypto phone. The initiative is an important part of Solana's entry into the world of Web3, which Solana thinks will be based around end-to-end mobile experiences. When integrated with Solana Pay (which launched in February 2022), Solana Mobile offers a very powerful value proposition. What other blockchain network can you think of that has its own native mobile device for blockchain experiences?\n\nBuy Solana for the long term\n\nWhile Solana certainly looks enticing as a quick, short-term play as a way to leverage all the new buzz around crypto at the start of a new year, I think Solana is even more attractive as a long-term play. If you check out some of the Solana price predictions for 2023, you'll start to see why. Some crypto analysts now think Solana could hit $25.44 by the end of the year, purely on technical factors. That would represent a near doubling of your investment, given Solana's current price of $13. When you take into account all of the new exciting initiatives happening within the Solana ecosystem, I think Solana can go even higher. As a result, I'm extremely bullish on Solana for the long-term future."

        "title": "Looking back and ahead: Q&A with Solana Beach Mayor Lesa Heebner - Del Mar Times",
        "content": "Solana Beach Mayor Lesa Heebner recently discussed the top issues in Solana Beach over the last year, and previewed the year ahead. Answers were lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nQ: What were some of your top highlights in 2022?\n\nHeebner: Generally, we approved a number of public infrastructure projects that we also received funding for, or found our own funding for, so in 2023 we\u2019ll be seeing a number of groundbreakings. Those include our Army Corps sand replenishment project. That project has been going on for literally decades. It\u2019s a 50-year sand replenishment program jointly with the city of Encinitas and the Army Corps of Engineers, and Congressman Levin was able to get us $32 million to put us pretty much over the finish line in terms of planning. It will widen our beaches and provide more safety for those who come to our beaches.\n\nWe also, through Levin\u2019s great work, were able to receive $7 million for our Lomas Santa Fe Corridor Improvement plan. That will be breaking ground soon. It will probably be coming to council in the next month or two to determine how we\u2019re going to go ahead with this. We already discussed publicly that we would start from the east side and head west, so the east side would see the multipurpose trail on the north side of Lomas Santa Fe and some \u2014 the project itself generally is for public safety for all forms of transportation to improve safety and access to mobility, and also to beautify the corridor with this multipurpose trail on the north side, which will be landscaped and maybe have some art along it. It\u2019s going to be kind of like the coastal rail trail, but we\u2019ll have that version of it going along the east-west corridor instead of the north-south corridor. Those two are pretty big projects that receive chunks of money that will be moving forward in the next year.\n\nThe other big projects are our tot lots at Fletcher Cove and La Colonia Community Park. They\u2019re well-used and quite dilapidated. Those should be well underway in the next couple of months. That will be a huge improvement that our community will benefit from as well.\n\nQ: Last month you mentioned that former Councilmember Kelly Harless was a casualty of the transition to district-based elections. How does it feel to have completed that transition after last fall\u2019s election?\n\nHeebner: I was not in favor of districting our city, I think it\u2019s absurd to have a city our size divided up into four quadrants, which are each less than one square mile. It\u2019s absurd in a way and you have to find candidates within a very small radius of the city who are qualified and willing to run. We lucked out that we have Jill MacDonald who was willing to run for District 4. I\u2019ve known Jill for a long time and was very happy she was willing to step up and do that. So I\u2019m pleased with the composition of our council, but I wish we could have six of us so we didn\u2019t have to lose Kelly. She was an amazing council member. She was always prepared, and always articulate and always very thoughtful and considerate of not just her area of the city, but the entire city, and of the experience of our residents and businesses.\n\nQ: What issues in Solana Beach are on your radar heading into 2023?\n\nHeebner: We\u2019ve got a few things we have to look out for, we\u2019re always watching what the state\u2019s up to in terms of more housing policies to deal with. And now we\u2019ve got what the fairgrounds might be doing with their strategic planning with profit seeming to be their priority, and hopefully the cities will be able to be involved in that strategic plan. We know what our communities will accept. Hopefully it will include affordable housing units for the city of Del Mar.\n\nWe\u2019ll be doing our work plan in early spring, and what I\u2019ve found over all these years is that we put out what our priorities are and what we want to do and then life happens. You have to address certain things and put other things on hold. We\u2019re looking forward to getting a certified housing element, we\u2019ve gotten some positive comments back from the Department of Housing and Community Development since we submitted it once again. We\u2019re also looking at the property just to the south of us, on the north bluff in Del Mar. Whatever is there impacts Solana Beach far more than it impacts Del Mar. Hopefully we can work well with Del Mar to ensure that their zoning is adhered to there.\n\nQ: Will you also be paying close attention to the plan to move the train tracks off the Del Mar bluff and into an inland tunnel, since Solana Beach residents are likely to see and feel the impacts?\n\nHeebner: I\u2019m on SANDAG, so for sure we\u2019ll be talking about that. Having just over the holidays taken the trip up to Santa Barbara on the Amtrak, I had to go Amtrak, bus, Amtrak. It went as smoothly as possible but it added a good hour to the transit time and it wasn\u2019t wonderful. So will the LOSSAN corridor have to be relocated starting farther north than we anticipated? It seems as if that\u2019s the case to me. Of course, those funds need to come from the feds and the state, because they\u2019re going to be billions.\n\nQ: Anything else you want to add?\n\nHeebner: I\u2019m just really pleased to be serving and looking forward to the next year and progress and improving the quality of life for residents in Solana Beach, helping our businesses out where we can. Another thing we\u2019ve got is Fiesta del Sol coming up, and I know they\u2019re reorienting their layout. It\u2019s been quite successful over the last year too, and I think there\u2019s some good people in charge of it. It\u2019s exciting to see the city come alive again out of the COVID-19 pandemic."
