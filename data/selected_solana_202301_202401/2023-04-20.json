        "title": "Solana Saga: The DeFi phone you don't need - Protos",
        "content": "Many people involved in crypto may not be familiar with Moshe Hogeg, a disgraced Israeli entrepreneur who, as well as founding and investing in numerous apps, businesses, and social media platforms, has been sued, arrested, and forced to sell his interest in Beitar Jerusalem FC (a top-tier Israeli football team).\n\nBut Hogeg\u2019s most glorious failure was his attempt to launch a cryptocurrency phone called the Finney (named for possible-Satoshi Nakamoto Hal Finney).\n\nThe Finney unfortunately \u2014 or fortunately, depending on whose side you\u2019re on \u2014 never really made a splash, instead sinking like a stone in the sea of horrendous ideas spawned during the 2018 crypto winter.\n\nWell now the Finney is back, but this time it\u2019s brought to you by Solana and has been rebadged as a DeFi device. Meet the Saga.\n\nRave reviews (from Solana Enjoyooorrrss)\n\nOf course, the former lead investor for FTX Ventures has already given it her seal of approval, so maybe Protos is being too quick to judge. But the entire experience sounds genuinely clunky.\n\nIn a demo by Danny Nelson of CoinDesk, he minted an NFT. Thing is, he had to approve permissions twice and provide a fingerprint login six times. This begs the question, was it worth it for a Solana NFT?\n\nBut perhaps that\u2019s not really doing the phone justice. After all, the Saga is also a hardware wallet. Is this a good thing? Again, that\u2019s still unclear.\n\nRecently, people have been piling on Ledger for releasing a necklace hardware wallet. They\u2019ve rightly pointed out that an easily-identifiable crypto wallet that could be yanked off your neck, never to be seen again, might not be the best idea. Is a phone with a Solana engraving, fingerprint ID, and all your NFTs and crypto stored on it a much better idea?\n\nGrowth is a must for Solana\n\nSolana founder Anatoly Yakovenko imagines cryptocurrency users cracking a billion and utilizing self-custody \u2014 but only if cell phones are used as hardware wallets. \u201cThe Saga is the first device where crypto is treated as a first-class citizen in mobile,\u201d he says.\n\nIt isn\u2019t obvious why Solana\u2019s dev teams felt as though building an Android phone was necessary for the future as opposed to software wallets combined with hardware or paper wallets you keep safely stored away in a safety deposit box or at home.\n\nPerhaps the best comparison would be the difference between a bank account and the cash in your wallet: the majority of your money will remain in the bank, where even if a robber comes and steals it, you\u2019re protected through insurance and other mechanisms. You\u2019re not going to keep thousands or millions of dollars in a wallet because you could lose it, have it stolen, or accidentally destroy it.\n\nWhy anyone would want to keep their NFT collections or all of their cryptocurrency on their person at all times seems incredibly silly and unnecessary.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem has been struggling since the collapse of FTX and criminal charges against Sam Bankman Fried.\n\nRead more: Can Solana stay afloat without SBF and FTX?\n\nNeedless to say, Flipside Crypto has been monitoring USDC sales of the Solana Saga, and while the company may have sold more through credit card transactions, the numbers aren\u2019t exactly thrilling: 560+ orders, $560,000 in sales.\n\nWill the second $1,000 cryptocurrency phone in the past five years do better than its predecessor, the Finney? That remains to be seen.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail. For more informed news, follow us on Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky, and Google News, or subscribe to our YouTube channel."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana Monkey Business (SMB) is one of the most valuable and prominent Solana NFT collections, and the project has been steadily supported by MonkeDAO\u2014an independent collective of SMB holders. And today, the DAO announced that following disputes with the creators and the collection's most recent owner, it has officially acquired the IP to the project.\n\nMonkeDAO purchased the SMB IP and all related keys, assets, and accounts from Solana NFT exchange Hadeswap for $2 million in a deal that was authorized by a HadesDAO governance proposal approved by nearly 97% of token-based votes.\n\n\u201cI think it's a great resolution for the community to be able to showcase ownership and responsibility for the leadership of a project,\u201d pseudonymous MonkeDAO CEO and co-founder Nom told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn social media posts, MonkeDAO\u2014a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), or an exclusive online community with token-based membership\u2014framed the occasion as its \u201cindependence day,\u201d referencing a long road to finally owning the IP that members had built a collective around.\n\nSolana Monkey Business was one of the first notable NFT projects on Solana, launching in June 2021 with a small Gen1 collection before dropping the 5,000 pixel profile pictures that have come to define the project.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam, the Gen2 collection has yielded some $164 million worth of trading volume to date. Secondary market prices start at just over 200 SOL, or about $4,375, per data from Magic Eden.\n\nMonkeDAO took shape soon after the Gen2 launch, with members forming a community around the NFTs and pursuing collective measures like in-person events, a DAO-managed Solana network validator, and even investments in startups.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut a dispute grew between the DAO and the original pseudonymous creators of SMB, with MonkeDAO requesting a share of secondary market royalties to fund initiatives that it believed had given the project additional value. MonkeDAO said that the creators had promised a certain amount of funding, but only delivered a fraction of that.\n\nIn early 2022, MonkeDAO members considered \u201cwrapping\u201d their SMB NFTs as new tokens to direct royalties away from the creators and send those funds to the DAO treasury instead. Ultimately, however, the two sides came to an agreement over funding.\n\nIn February of this year, Hadeswap announced that it had successfully purchased the SMB IP from the original creators, with plans to expand the IP and \u201c[bridge] the gap on its shortcomings.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how much Hadeswap paid for the IP.\n\nNom told Decrypt at the time that MonkeDAO had also been in the process of trying to buy the IP. MonkeDAO and Hadeswap appeared to be uneasy allies following the surprise deal, with DAO members pushing back against Hadeswap\u2019s planned governance model.\n\n\u201cHadeswap had plans around governance via the HadesDAO, which ultimately didn't line up with the governance incentives people were expecting via previous voting tied to ownership of the actual SMB NFT,\u201d Nom told Decrypt.\n\nIn a recent Twitter thread, pseudonymous NFT whale SOL Big Brain said that he provided a $1 million bridge loan to MonkeDAO to initiate the agreed-upon purchase process with Hadeswap. Big Brain wrote that pseudonymous Hadeswap founder HGE did not want a dispute with MonkeDAO to \u201cdrag on for months,\u201d and opted instead to sell to the collective.\n\n\u201cFor the broad future, SMB and MonkeDAO represent the best community of builders, founders, devs, and degenerates in the Solana ecosystem,\u201d Nom said. \u201cWe are dedicated to pushing not only better experiences and opportunities to our members, but also to expand what it means to be a part of MonkeDAO.\u201d"
