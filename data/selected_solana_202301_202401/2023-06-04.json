The potential retest will validate that the buyers can sustain the higher levels.\n\nThis retest will also be the entry opportunity for potential buyers after which the price is expected to rally to 12% to hit the $24 mark.\n\nIn case, the daily candle plunges below the neckline resistance the bullish thesis will get invalidated.\n\nWill Solana Price Poke $24 ?\n\nIn theory, the potential target for the inverted head and shoulder pattern is the distance between the head\u2019s low and neckline shot from the breakout point. Thus, with sustained buying, the SOL price is likely to hit $24, facing an in-between hurdle of $23.\n\nDMI: A massive spread between the DI+ and DI- slope reflects a positive trend sentiment for the Solana coin\n\nExponential Moving Average: With the recent growth, the buyers reclaimed daily EMAs (20, 50, 100) offering additional support for the coin price to hold higher."
