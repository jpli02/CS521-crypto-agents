        "content": "The Solana (SOL) token is one of the biggest losers on the crypto market with a price drop of around 30% in the last seven days. After the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared the Solana token as well as numerous other altcoins as securities in its lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance US, the SOL price plummeted.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, the SEC could sue Solana Foundation in the same way it did Ripple Labs in December 2020. Thus, the bottom of the SOL price\u2019s slump might not be reached yet, if the SEC really takes this step and thus causes more investors to panic sell.\n\nSolana Community And Developers Oppose The SEC\n\nThe Solana Foundation has now responded to the SEC\u2019s classification of its SOL token as an unregistered security. In a statement, it said, \u201cThe Solana Foundation strongly believes that SOL is not a security,\u201d adding \u201cSOL is the native token to the Solana blockchain, a robust, open-source, community-based software project that relies on decentralized user and developer engagement to expand and evolve.\u201d\n\nWhile one developer at a recent event dismissed the SEC\u2019s legal action, stating that developers \u201cgive a shit\u201d about what the SEC thinks, there is a part of the community that is already thinking about possible ways to solve the SEC issue.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nSOL Price Prediction: Solana Turns Sell On Rallies As It Breaks $20 1 year ago\n\nThe founder of Degen Picks launched a poll within the Solana community on whether the blockchain should fork to avoid the regulatory issues with the SEC. A total of 2,050 people participated in the poll, 39.9% answered \u201cyup\u201d while 24.2% answered \u201cstfu\u201d (shut the fuck up).\n\nOK hear me out. It\u2019s time to fork $SOL. SEC dissapears, FTX bankruptcy can dump on themselves. $BTC and $ETH both did it. cc @SOLBigBrain Your reaction? \u2014 Caps\u00b2 (@capsjpeg) June 10, 2023\n\nSurprisingly, the idea is supported by Abracadabra founder @HGEABC. Via Twitter, he responded to the poll, writing, \u201cBold but not a bad idea actually. Community fork Solana will get rid of SEC issue. No bankruptcy will dump on you for next 3 years continuously. ETH is a fork of ETC and doing well. Blink twice if you agree.\u201d\n\nA user then asked the Abracadabra founder if he could get Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and his team to work on the fork. The Abracadabra founder speculated that they \u201cprobably will\u201d if they are sued by the SEC. \u201cThen work on the fork save their own problem too.\u201d Remarkably, the Solana Foundation has not yet responded to the poll.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBillions Of Dollars Tokenized Bitcoin Moved To Ethereum, BSC, And Solana 1 year ago\n\nOverall, however, there are mixed opinions in the community about the fork. It\u2019s also worth noting that proponents don\u2019t have a specific plan for a fork yet.\n\nNevertheless, according to the founder of Degen Picks, a fork could not only solve the SEC problem, but also FTX bankruptcy. A copy of the Solana chain could be given a new set of rules and parameters. The FTX wallets could be blacklisted and not receive the new token.\n\nSOL Price Keeps Falling\n\nAt press time, the SOL price was trading at $15.15. The 1-day chart shows the dicey situation for the SOL price. The bulls need to defend the $12.82 level at all costs to prevent a fall to the December 2022 low at $8.02.\n\nTo the upside, the $16.00 level is the key resistance for now. With an RSI of 26.2, SOL is in oversold territory and could initiate a recovery.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from TradingView.com"
