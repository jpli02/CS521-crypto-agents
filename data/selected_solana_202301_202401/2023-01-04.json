        "content": "BONK launched and began its first airdrops on 25 December 2022 \u2013 Photo: Getty Images\n\nSolana (SOL) has enjoyed an increase in price at the same time as the meteoric rise of meme coin bonk (BONK), which describes itself as \u201cthe first Solana dog coin for the people, by the people\u201d.\n\nAs of 12:27 GMT on 4 January, SOL was trading at $13.70, up by 15.68% compared with the previous day, according to CoinMarketCap. At about the same time, BONK was up by 106.10% and trading at $0.00000227.\n\nBONK launched and began its first airdrops on 25 December 2022 and has since been a much-talked topic on crypto Twitter.\n\nFollowing the airdrop, half of the total supply went straight to the SOL community, with 20% going to SOL non-fungible token (NFT) collectors, 15% to early openbook traders, 10% to SOL artists and collectors and 5% to SOL developers.\n\nIn the run-up to its launch, BONK announced via Twitter: \u201cWe\u2019re here to reward everyone that made SOL what it is today.\u201d\n\nSOL to USD\n\nSBF and SOL\n\nPrior to its rise, SOL had struggled during December 2022, with the majority of the month seeing losses for the crypto.\n\nOne issue that has not helped SOL lately was the associations between it and Sam Bankman-Fried (also known as SBF), the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.\n\nSBF had held a large amount of SOL tokens and was a supporter of the crypto. Just before the collapse of FTX \u2013 which filed for bankruptcy on 11 November 2022 \u2013 SOL was trading at $37.\n\nAs part of the documentation on its webstie, BONK alluded to the FTX fallout directly and said:\n\n\u201cThe bonk contributors were tired of toxic \u2018Alameda\u2019 tokenomics and wanted to make a fun meme coin where everyone gets a fair shot.\u201d\n\nAlameda Research was a quantitative crypto trading firm that was also founded by SBF and filed for bankruptcy at the same time as FTX.\n\nWhat is your sentiment on SOL/USD? 168.1474 Bullish or Bearish Vote to see Traders sentiment!

        "content": "Memecoins have been a part of the crypto culture for almost as long as the community existed, but 2020 and 2021 saw them soar to a whole new level.\n\nIt got to a point where two memecoins \u2013 Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) became frequent members of the top-10 club (the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by means of total market capitalization).\n\nThe bear market of 2022 has impacted most memecoins severely, but DOGE and SHIB continue to be leading coins.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s a new kid on the block \u2013 one built on Solana \u2013 and is going the miles. The cryptocurrency in question is called Bonk Inu (BONK), so let\u2019s have a closer look at what it actually does.\n\nWhat is Bonk Inu (BONK)?\n\nAccording to its official one-pager, BONK is the very first Dog-themed memecoin on Solana that\u2019s \u201cfor the people, by the people.\u201d\n\nThe document states:\n\nThe BONK contributors were tired of toxic \u201cAlameda\u201d tokenomics and wanted to make a fun memecoin where everyone gets a fair shot.\n\n50% of the total supply of the cryptocurrency was airdropped to the Solana community, while the main purpose of the team behind it is to bring back liquidity to decentralized exchanges built on Solana.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s pretty much everything the document outlines, alongside the token distribution.\n\nBONK Token Distribution Explained\n\nAs mentioned above, 50% of the supply was airdropped to the Solana community, divided as it follows:\n\n20% of it went to Solana NFT collections (297K individual NFTs)\n\n15% to early OpenBook traders\n\n10% to Solana collectors and artists\n\n5% to Solana developers\n\nThe total supply is set to 100 trillion BONK tokens. The provided pie chart looks like this:\n\nMassive BONK Burning Propelling the Price\n\nThroughout the past few days, the team behind BONK has burned a considerable number of tokens and has introduced certain capabilities that allow users to burn tokens themselves.\n\nFor instance, on December 4th, the team announced that the allocation that was supposed to go to the DeGods NFT project has been burned. The transaction can be found here. It saw 500 billion BONK tokens wiped off the market forever.\n\nThis sent the price to the sky, as it was up more than 100% on that day at one point. Overall, since it was launched, the cryptocurrency has already increased by over 3000% in the past week.\n\nAnother reason for this is the fact that liquidity providers on popular decentralized exchanges such as Orca are yielding APIs upwards of 1000% at the time of this writing.\n\nThe BONK/SOL trading pair also saw a massive 24-hour volume of around $20 million.\n\nThe team, as with many memecoin projects, has remained anonymous. The website itself doesn\u2019t contain other information but the one-pager and the rest of the links to BONK-related resources."

Each person paying upfront for the device will receive a gift from Solana Spaces.\n\nPreordering the Saga\n\nThe smartphone costs $1,000, but customers who place pre-orders will receive a $100 refund. The early birds will also get a gift upon placing their order for 100 USDC.\n\nOn the phone right now with the @solanamobile Twitter intern.\n\n\n\nIf you *ahem* recently got airdropped generational wealth, do yourself a favor and pre-order SAGA for 100 USDC.\n\n\n\nShow us a receipt from today and we'll send you a NFT from the @solanaspaces vault. \u2014 Solana Spaces (@solanaspaces) January 4, 2023\n\nOnce ordered, customers are required to show the receipt on the Solana (SOL) space Twitter page, and then an NFT gift will be sent to them promptly from the Solana Spaces vault.\n\nPreordered a @solanamobile Saga and was sent a Just Ape by @solanaspaces as a gift. SOL mfers truly built with a differential. https://t.co/keGse12Lei \u2014 mako (@makkosol) January 4, 2023\n\nSpecifications of Solana Saga\n\nThe phone contains a 6.67-inch 120Hz OLED display mounted on a ceramic back reinforced by a stainless steel frame. The materials used to make the phone make it weigh about 247 grams. It has an 8.4 mm thickness, and a triangular-shaped camera fitted together with a fingerprint scanner. In addition, the phone is both dust and water-resistant at a rating of IP68.\n\nSaga is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip with Android 13. It contains 12 GB RAM and internal storage of 512 GB. The company included 8+Gen 1-security features to enable Solana Mobile Stack\u2019s Seed Vault. The phone can segregate the private key and seed phrases from the application layer while allowing other apps to run.\n\nmight get fired for sharing this but\n\n\n\nworth it https://t.co/llQockSWVM pic.twitter.com/Wgqh0jvcLw \u2014 Solana Spaces (@solanaspaces) October 7, 2022\n\nThe new Solana phone has a 4100 mAh battery capacity with wireless charging capabilities. The rear part consists of a dual camera with a 50MP IMX766 f/1.8 sensor and another 12MP IMX373 f/2.2 120-degree ultrawide camera. In addition, a 16MP camera on the front side improves selfie-taking.\n\nInvitations for development and access\n\nWhen the Solana team was creating the phone, it sent invitations for preorders and participation in its development. Anyone who wanted to be a developer was given a chance to send their applications. The team gave priority to the information sent during checkouts.\n\nDevelopers got the DVT1 hoping to get the actual version after its launch without further charges. Everyone getting the DVT1 required understanding the seed vault and Saga app.\n\nThe creation of the Solana Saga involved many developers, thus making the program more accessible. However, a limited number of those received the invitations to work with the team."

        "title": "Solana Thrives on BONK Meme Coin Hype; SOL Price Approaches Crucial Hurdle - Securities.io",
        "content": "Solana (SOL) suffered a peculiarly more significant price pullback than most rival alts for the majority of last year due to its substantial presence in the balance sheets of financially afflicted FTX and its affiliated entities. The token's recent market performance has, however, seemingly restored confidence among investors. A price recovery to double-digit territory fresh into the year wiped away the bulk of FTX contagion-inspired losses making token holders growingly convinced that the tides could be turning good.\n\nThe Solana native token has attracted tremendous interest from many market makers this week. The latest available data at press showed that only Ethereum ($174.798M) had logged a higher 24-hour net staking inflow than Solana's $97.14M.The ecosystem has also been logging fair SOL engaged balance figures close to the record high for the metric, as highlighted by the explorer tool Staking Rewards earlier today. The observation has been chalked up to a renewed ascent in the past few days after an unsettling slip below $10 at the end of last year.\n\nA pertinacious decline following reports of sabotaging news in Solana's NFT niche pushed SOL price towards the single-digit territory, setting a multi-month low of $8.15 on Dec 29 as per CoinMarketCap data. Backing from the broader crypto community has since inspired an intermediate uptrend of the SOL/USD pair. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was among the notable crypto figures who voiced his support for the ecosystem, amusingly once dubbed the \u2018Ethereum killer,' in a tweet last Friday.\n\nDog-themed meme coin inspires SOL price gains\n\nThe newly launched Shiba Inu-copy Bonk project conducted a largescale airdrop, distributing 50% of its token supply to Solana creators, developers and NFT owners on Dec 25. The gradual uptake of the dog-themed coin has partially contributed to reviving interest in the Solana ecosystem. The BONK token has surpassed a milestone of 101,000 holders. Dune Analytics BONK statistics dashboard shows that more than 2.8 million transactions have been completed thus far. The SOL market has predictably seen swollen trading activity as sharp participants look to get involved.\n\nMarket data shows that SOL price has leapt by 36.95% in the last seven days and 58.74% from its trough. This positive rebound, after consecutive daily losses, has neutralized the previous week's negative returns whilst catapulting the SOL token into the top 20 in market capital rankings. At the same time, the fresh gains have meant liquidations for some traders.\n\nAlmost $15 million of short positions have been closed this week on account of this price improvement, according to liquidation data from Coinglass.\n\nSolana (SOL) price closes in on the previous resistance zone\n\nOn the 30-day price chart, the latest recovery has helped push the SOL/USD pair closer to a decisive trading range above $14.70 that could either clear a path towards reclaiming mid-December levels or lead to a mild correction towards the $10 psychological support.\n\nThere are reasonable concerns that the price of Solana could resume a downtrend once the hype around the BONK token fades. Further supporting this well-grounded projection is the blatant lack of utility of the meme coin and the absence of promising underlying tech. This ultimately means that traders could settle for a quick exit, lowering prices below the immediate resistance range of around $14.80.\n\nSolana executive assures network activity is still bright\n\nIn separate Tuesday remarks to CoinDesk TV, Solana Foundation's Austin Federa, assured that recent damaging developments have not affected the network's activity. The Solana executive noted that developers have continued building their projects on the blockchain. Users, too, have not shied away from the ecosystem as reflected in on-chain activity metrics.\n\nTo learn more about Solana, visit our Investing in Solana guide.\n\nPrice movements in the rest of the crypto market\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have maintained their fair-to-middling action, retaining the sector-wide green trading theme for the day. The total market capital has clawed up to $817 billion from slightly over $800 billion on Monday. Ethereum Classic (ETC) leads the top gainers, having printed a 20.5% 24-hr green candle at press time. NEAR Protocol's NEAR is trading at similar profit margins, up 18.31% in the same period, followed by Lido DAO (LDO) and EthereumPoW (ETHW), which have all recorded double-digit gains today. OKB exchange token (OKB) and HTX token (HT) \u2013 now a correction path \u2013 have fallen among Wednesday's biggest losers."
