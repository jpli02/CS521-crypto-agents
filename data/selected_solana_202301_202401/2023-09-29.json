        "content": "Only Possible on Solana ($OPOS), a new memecoin running on the Solana blockchain, has sparked a lot of frenzies among the Solana community. Just a few hours after its early phase launch, the token has quickly gained so much attention from the community and seen early success.\n\n$OPOS Sees Early Success\n\nSolana block explorer Solscan revealed that the first 1 million $OPOS were minted on September 28, approximately 15 hours ago, and quickly became the most searched token on Solscan. Within hours of launch, the memecoin garnered more than 2,300 holders, and its 24-hour volume surpassed 11.7 million.\n\nAfter initial minting, the full $OPOS value was transferred to a separate address and used to conduct liquidity provider (LP) activities. As displayed by Solscan, 999,999.99 $OPOS, and 689,999.99 $USDC were added to the Orca LP. At the time of writing, Orca LP is the largest holder of $OPOS, accounting for more than 34.85% of the current supply.\n\nToken Distribution\n\nIncluding Orca LP, the top ten holders of $OPOS collectively hold 462,666.26 tokens, representing 46.27% of the supply. The other accounts hold 537,333.69 tokens (53.73%).\n\n$OPOS\u2019 early success can be attributed to several factors, including strong community support and its association with the Solana ecosystem. Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability, low transaction fees, and fast transaction speeds. Labeled the \u2018Ethereum Killer,\u2019 the blockchain is seen as the most serious challenger to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe memecoin\u2018s early success could have also been boosted by the previous success of several other Solana-based memecoins, such as $BONK and $SAMO. Both tokens have seen their prices skyrocket in recent weeks and have helped attract much attention to the Solana ecosystem from memecoin enthusiasts.\n\nWhile it is still early to say whether $OPOS will be able to maintain its current momentum in the long run, its early success suggests that it has the potential to compete in the Solana memecoin space."

        "title": "Crypto Price Analysis Sep-29: ETH, XRP, ADA, SOL, and LINK - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and Chainlink.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThis week is ending with good news for Ethereum investors. The price has reclaimed its place within the ascending triangle and booked a 4.8% gain in the past seven days.\n\nIt was critical for ETH to get back into this formation as staying below it could have triggered a wave of selling pressure until the key support at $1,440. Fortunately, bulls came to the rescue, and now ETH is testing if it can push above the key resistance at $1,660.\n\nLooking ahead, ETH has seemingly put a stop to the downtrend, at least temporarily. If buyers break the current resistance then this cryptocurrency could return on an uptrend and aim for $1,800 next.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nXRP exploded today and is well on its way to reach the key resistance at 57 cents after booking a 7% increase this week.\n\nThis latest price action shows that buyers are back and may dominate in the next few days. Prior to this, volatility has been rather flat with little momentum.\n\nThe key levels of the current range have remained unchanged with support at 47 cents and resistance at 57 cents. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency may attempt to break the key resistance next.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano has reached the critical resistance at 25 cents, booking a 2.7% price increase this week.\n\nThe support at 24 cents managed to hold off any selling pressure and served as a pivot for a reversal. So long as buyers dominate the chart, ADA has a good chance at moving higher.\n\nLooking ahead, the consolidation in the current range may soon end if ADA manages to break away from the current resistance. After that it can quickly go to 28 cents next.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana continues to impress with its resilience and has returned to the $20 resistance. It did not manage to break it yet, but it did succeed to book a 2.2% price increase this week.\n\nThe support at $19 was critical, and it managed to hold. This allowed SOL to return on an uptrend and approach the key resistance again.\n\nLooking ahead, Solana has a good opportunity to break above $20 and move to the following key resistance found at $22.5. With the downtrend channel left behind, this price action looks promising.\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nThe spotlight of this past week goes to Chainlink, which has managed to book an impressive 14.4% price increase. This makes LINK the best performer on our list and its price has now reached the critical resistance at $8.\n\nAfter a successful test of the support at $5.7, this cryptocurrency rushed towards the resistance above in a matter of days. Buyers came in strong and the price did not hesitate to show it.\n\nLooking ahead, LINK has a great opportunity to break away from its range that has kept the price in check since June 2022. A breakout would signal a significant change in its market structure and could be very bullish, which could attract significant buy pressure later."
