        "content": "Solana Price Prediction as Accumulation Continues at $20 Level \u2013 Can SOL Reach $1,000 in the Next Bull Run?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Solana price has swung strongly today, reaching a 24-hour high of $20.48 before retreating in the past few hours to $19.59.\n\nThis latest price represents a 2% drop in the past day, yet SOL is also up by 4% in a week, while being down by 6.5% in the last 30 days.\n\nBut with the altcoin also having risen strongly since the beginning of the year (up by 96%), it maintains the kind of medium-term momentum that will help it recover quickly from today\u2019s volatility.\n\nSolana Price Prediction as Accumulation Continues at $20 Level \u2013 Can SOL Reach $1,000 in the Next Bull Run?\n\nSOL\u2019s indicators have moved into a position where it looks as though the altcoin is about to begin a concerted rally, one which is now probably overdue.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nIts relative strength index (purple) has risen to 50 in the past few days, indicating an increase of momentum that has plenty of space to continue before the altcoin will be overbought.\n\nIn parallel, SOL\u2019s 30-day moving average (yellow) has flattened out after falling below its 200-day average (blue), signalling that buyers may be tempted to buy the coinnow that it\u2019s selling at a discount.\n\nAnd even with today\u2019s little dip, the coin\u2019s support level (green) has been rising recently, meaning that it\u2019s unlikely to fall below recent lows.\n\nAs such, now is a good time to buy SOL, which is still selling at a discount but which has shown the first signs of renewed momentum.\n\nIn terms of fundamentals, there has been no major news in the past few days, yet the overall picture remains largely positive for Solana."

        "title": "Solana-Based DeFi Protocol Drift Hits New TVL Over $20M - Coinfomania",
        "content": "As the Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem continues to pick up, several platforms are breaking through new frontiers, onboarding more users and cash. Drift protocol, a Solana-based perpetual swap trading project, is the latest among them.\n\nAccording to on-chain data from the blockchain analytics platform DeFiLlama, the Drift protocol has now locked in a new total value locked (TVL) of $20.16 million.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nWhat is Drift Protocol?\n\nLaunched in 2021 by Cindy Leow, Drift Protocol emerged as an open-source decentralized exchange (DEX) that facilitates non-custodial trading to users. The platform also enables users to borrow, lend, stake, and swap cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe project is backed by the crypto-focused investment firm Multicoin Capital, which led a $3.8 million seed funding for the DEX in October 2021.\n\nDrift protocol presently runs its version 2 (v2), a sequel to the project\u2019s v1 providing enhanced liquidity, market making, and collateralization to improve trading experience.\n\nWhile unveiling Drift v2 last year, the protocol added that Drift v1 attracted over 15,000 cumulative users and more than $10 billion in trading volume within six months.\n\nDrift Protocol Attains New TVL\n\nDrift Protocol\u2019s latest milestone follows a three-month steady increase in TVL, going from $11.8 million in August to its current valuation. The project\u2019s achievement can be attributed to an increase in engagement with its service from investors.\n\nA factor that may be contributing to the increase is the addition of new trading tools to offer users a seamless trading experience. The latest among these tools is the Auto-confirm feature rolled out in collaboration with the crypto wallet provider Phantom.\n\nLike Drift, other Solana-based protocols are actively making waves within the crypto space. For example, Star Atlas, a space-themed gaming platform building on the Solana blockchain, accounted for over 15% of the daily trading volume of the network\u2019s transactions earlier this month.\n\nThe impressive achievements of these projects have rubbed off on Solana\u2019s overall performance. SOL, the native coin for the blockchain, currently trades at $23.5, a 20% increase over the past month."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nSolana (SOL) has recently showcased formidable resurgence, as can be observed from its recent trading charts. This comeback holds significant importance, not only from a technical standpoint but also for its broader implications on a volatile crypto market. An analysis of the attached chart will elucidate some of the crucial aspects underlying this rebound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the most notable elements on the chart is the potential for Solana to conquer the neckline resistance once more. For the uninitiated, the neckline resistance is a crucial point on the chart that acts as a threshold for bullish momentum. Historically, surpassing this point often indicates the potential for a sustained uptrend, hinting at further gains in the near future. In the case of Solana, this would mean a strong comeback from its recent lulls, reinforcing its position as a dominant player in the crypto space.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nFurthermore, keen observers might also anticipate the possibility of a \"golden cross.\" This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically indicating a potential bullish breakout.\n\nSuch a move is often regarded as a significant buy signal among crypto enthusiasts and could potentially bring a flurry of investments into Solana. The daily chart, with its intertwining moving averages, suggests that such a crossover might be on the horizon. This development, combined with the breaching of the neckline resistance, paints an optimistic future for Solana.\n\nBeyond these technical indicators, it is crucial to recognize Solana's overarching position on the crypto market. Despite facing challenges, as all cryptocurrencies inevitably do, Solana continues to stand tall as one of the strongest performers in the crypto realm. Its resilience, adaptability and innovative features have consistently propelled it to the forefront, even amid market downturns."

        "content": "The video was retweeted by several members of both the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) community, with many criticizing the investors for their apparent lack of interest in the project, as well as a lack of concern for other investors who are not necessarily able to buy coins at a discount.\n\nAmong the many people who shared the video clip on Twitter was the popular crypto trader @DegenSpartan, who commented that \u201cit is fallacious to ever be thinking that you\u2019re playing on a level playing field with any of the VCs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as pointed out by other Twitter users, the short video clip \u2013 less than one minute long \u2013 did not give a very good picture of what the discussion between the investors was really about.\n\nIn the full version of the video, uploaded on the All-in Podcast\u2019s YouTube channel, a more nuanced discussion could be heard, with the investors talking about the merits of Solana as well their investments in it.\n\nFor instance, David Sacks explained how his firm has had exposure to Solana since the protocol\u2019s early days through an investment in the crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital, and that they have now made \u201cabout a billion dollars\u201d in returns from the investment.\n\nMoreover, Sacks was also heard saying in the video that there is \u201ca lot of smart money in Silicon Valley that is betting on a flippening where Solana could ultimately overtake Ethereum as the preferred platform [for smart contracts],\u201d and that this has given him the conviction to hold on to the trade.\n\nEthereum is different from Solana as it is a decentralized network, while Solana experienced a serious outage in September when the network was offline for 17 hours.\n\nFurther, speaking about the timeframes of investments like the one in SOL, Chamath Palihapitiya explained that the timeframe depends on whether it is viewed as \u201can investment or an idea that you love so much,\u201d while adding \u201cif it\u2019s the latter you should never sell.\u201d\n\nAnd although some investors may feel discouraged by the fact that larger investors got in at discounted prices long before them, some industry observers are still bullish on the future of Solana.\n\nBased on responses from a panel of 50 fintech specialists, a report released by Finder.com on Thursday came up with average price predictions for SOL of USD 235 for the end of 2021, USD 1,178 for the end of 2025, and USD 5,057 for the end of 2030.\n\nAt 15:27 UTC, SOL, ranked 4th by market capitalization, traded at USD 239, up almost 6% over the past 24 hours and 30% over the past 7 days. The price skyrocketed by over 16,800% in a year.\n\nSOL price chart:\n\n\n\nSource: coingecko.com\n\nWorth noting, however, was that the panelists\u2019 predictions varied wildly. Among the most pessimistic was the CEO of the trading platform Coinmama, Sagi Bakshi, who indicated a price of USD 50 in 2030, saying he has \u201cno idea if Solana will survive.\u201d\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum was Daniel Cawrey, Chief Operating Officer at Cypherpunk Holdings, who predicted a price of USD 20,000 for 2030, saying \u201cit scales better than ether and already has staking.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, crypto exchange Kraken also noted in a report today that \u201cSOL has continued to attract increasingly greater attention from new and existing market participants \u2013 especially institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith SOL appearing to remain in what could be deemed its third wave of \u2018price discovery,\u2019 the case could be made that SOL climbs meaningfully higher into the near year,\u201d the report said, suggesting a price target of USD 400 to 500 between December and the first quarter of next year.\n\n___\n\nWatch the full episode below:\n\n_____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 SOL Rallies on Strong Technicals, All-Time High in Total Value Locked\n\n\u2013 Solana Resists Selling as Details on Network Outage Emerge\n\n\n\n\u2013 Multi-Chain Future Brings Multiple Competitors to Bitcoin & Ethereum \u2013 Analysts\n\n\u2013 Ethereum, Solana, Polygon & Co Form A New Hot Market Of Blockchains\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Developers On Why They Don\u2019t See Cardano & Binance Chain As Rivals\n\n\u2013 Solana Founder On Critical DeFi Challenges and How To Fix Them"

        "title": "Solana vs. Ethereum: Renewed debate erupts over efficiency, development and scalability - FXStreet",
        "content": "Solana's energy consumption is at 658 joules per transaction against Ethereum's higher energy usage, sparking debate over which network works better.\n\nEthereum's robust developer community gives an advantage to the chain.\n\nThe two chains compete over scalability and intrinsic design constraints.\n\nCrypto developer who goes by the alias Ichigo on X, who is associated with Solana-based Helius Labs, has ignited another comparison between Ethereum and its smart chain competitor Solana. Ichigo pointed out that while the post-Merge Ethereum transactions use 144,000 joules of energy, Solana transactions require only 658 joules.\n\nSolana beats Ethereum in energy efficiency\n\nIchigo underscored Solana's energy efficiency by stating, \"The average Solana transaction uses 658 Joules of energy. That\u2019s less than a Google search. Few.\"\n\nYes because Solana is a single-threaded global state machine that's subject to fluctuating gas costs\n\n\n\nEthereum has inherent design limitations, which is why they had to move to the more modular approach of L2s. Solana was designed from the ground up with scalability in mind. It's\u2026 \u2014 Ichigo | helius.dev (@0xIchigo) October 18, 2023\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana rely on proof-of-stake methods, which are considered more environmentally efficient. Therefore, they are often pitted against each other.\n\nIn terms of energy emissions, Solana Foundation became the first chain ever to allow real-term emission measurement earlier this year. Between April 2022 and March 2023, it reported that its 2,390 block-producing nodes had a total carbon footprint in the average emissions term of 10,651.2 tonnes CO2. Therefore, the energy per transaction comes to a mere 879 joules in the said time frame, close to the recent claims by Ichigo.\n\nBased on data provided by the Ethereum Foundation, an estimated 2,601 megawatt hour is the requirement by the network in terms of electricity, leaving carbon emissions of 870 tonnes CO2.\n\nEthereum there for the \u201clong haul\u201d\n\nDespite Solana's dominance in energy efficiency, Ichigo emphasized Ethereum's resilience and significance as a major player.\n\n\"Ethereum will be around for the long haul - there are too many smart people working on it,\" Ichigo added in response to a user.\n\nThe influencer underlined that the involvement of developers and substantial financial activity within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it a long-term player. However, he anticipates that Ethereum may struggle with scaling compared to Solana given its single-threaded global state machine and fluctuating gas prices, making it less suitable for payment or decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nThe debate brings up the concept of modularity versus monolithic technology stacks, with Ichigo arguing that Solana's ground-up scalability-focused design contrasts with Ethereum's modular approach. This essentially has to do with how chains are built by taking into account speed, efficiency and flexibility.\n\nIn terms of support for decentralized finance applications, Solana dominates less than 1% of the total value locked in the crypto space. Meanwhile, Ethereum still dominates 53% of total TVL based on DeFiLlama data. While Ethereum supports 935 protocols, Solana houses 112 despite a rough year of public outages.\n\nAs per Token Terminal data, in the last 30 days, code commits that signify developer activity for Ethereum is at 1.28K while Solana is at 542.\n\nNonetheless, Solana has showcased its own strength with 81.49k daily active users over a 30-day average. Yet, it is still far from Ethereum's 324.21k daily active users.\n\nAn intriguing investment trend emerges, as Ethereum, despite its dominance, reports negative year-to-date flows amounting to $111 million based on CoinShares' last report. Contrarily, Solana attracted positive inflows of $59 million during the same timeframe.\n\nThis disparity signals a shift in investor preference to Solana. However, Ethereum maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a circulating market cap of $188.59 billion, with Solana far behind at $9.93 billion.\n\n\n\nSOL/ETH YTD chart\n\nIn the comparison between Solana and Ethereum, Solana emerges as the more energy-efficient network, with its carbon footprint and transaction energy usage significantly lower than that of Ethereum. However, Ethereum remains a formidable player, thanks to its strong developer community and substantial financial activity behind it. However, it might face scalability challenges compared to Solana, making the choice between the two networks dependent on specific use cases."
