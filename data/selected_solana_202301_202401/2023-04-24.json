        "content": "It appears the overall NFT market has cooled amid an extended crypto winter, with a handful of collections eliciting brief spikes in trading over the past few months. According to a Dune dashboard by SeaLaunch, the number of unique users across top NFT marketplaces including Blur, OpenSea and LooksRare fell to 7,805 on April 19, a low not seen since July 2021. The number of sales across NFT marketplaces also fell sharply, with 16,149 sales recorded on April 19, according to the same data from Dune. The last time the number of sales was that low was in November 2021. Numbers have recovered slightly over the past few days."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s Mad Lads NFT collection drove sales to surpass Ethereum\u2019s Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nPositive impact on Solana\u2019s NFT metrics, including an increase in unique high-value purchases and a recent price upswing.\n\nSolana [SOL] recently made waves in the NFT space and gave Ethereum a run for its money. The launch of an NFT collection on Solana has spiked various metrics, but did it translate to an increase in the value of SOL?\n\nRead Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nSolana NFT bosses\u2019 sales volume stats\n\nAccording to Crypto Slam\u2019s data on NFT collection sales, a Solana blockchain-based collection called Mad Lads has taken the top spot for the past 48 hours.\n\nWith over $4 million in sales, it surpassed the popular Ethereum NFT, Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s [BAYC], which had over $3.2 million.\n\nIn addition to the impressive sales figures, the Mad Lads NFT collection on the Solana blockchain recorded over 2,700 transactions and attracted more than 1,500 buyers and sellers.\n\nThese numbers far surpass the figures of its closest competitor, the BAYC on Ethereum. The surge in sales helped Solana become the second-highest blockchain for NFT sales volume, with over $5 million in sales and 25,000 transactions, trailing only behind Ethereum.\n\nSolana NFT metrics flash positives\n\nAccording to data from Crypto Slam, the latest development has positively impacted Solana\u2019s NFT metrics. Based on the data from Santiment, the total sales volume of NFTs in USD has been increasing sharply since March.\n\nA glance at the chart revealed that while there were some sporadic activities, sales have significantly surged in recent weeks. As of 22 April, the recorded sales exceeded $14 million and as of this writing, they have surpassed $3.9 million.\n\nTo put this into perspective, the highest sales in the last ten months before the March spikes were only $7.01 million.\n\nAdditionally, in a promising turn of events, the number of unique addresses that purchased NFTs worth over $100,000 on Solana has increased after months of stagnancy.\n\nAs of this writing, only one such address was recorded. But on 22 April, the number jumped to 19 and it peaked at 35 on 13 April. Also, this trend signifies a shift from the previous status quo of NFT sales, and it is a positive development worth noting.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nImpact on SOL?\n\nOver the past 48 hours, Solana experienced a gain of nearly 4%, as indicated on the daily timeframe chart. As of this writing, it was trading at approximately $22.06, representing a gain of over 1%.\n\nThis recent upswing propelled its price movement above the short and long Moving Averages. They now served as support levels around the $21 and $20 price regions."
