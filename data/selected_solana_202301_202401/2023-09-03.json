        "title": "Solana retests key support: Is a price reversal likely? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nSOL retraced to a crucial bullish order block near $18.\n\nMobChart showed massive buy limit orders at $18 and $19.\n\nSolana [SOL] breached the $20 psychological level, but the drop could ease as buying interest surged near the $18 and $19 levels. Nevertheless, Bitcoin [BTC] was stuck in the range-low at $25k at press time and could complicate a solid upswing for SOL.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nCan bulls defend the $18-$19 area?\n\nThe $20 level was crucial support between April, May and at the end of August. But it was breached in September. However, the plunge has hit a daily bullish order block (OB) of $18.3 \u2013 $19.5 (white).\n\nIf the demand spikes at the above bullish OB, SOL could target $22 or the 50% Fib level ($22.5) in the next few days.\n\nConversely, sellers could push it lower to 23.6% Fib level ($17.4) or the next daily bullish OB of $15.6 \u2013 $16.65 (cyan).\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) oscillated below 50 in the past few days, showing muted but equal buying and selling pressure.\n\nSimilarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) exhibited swings around the zero mark, reinforcing capital inflows wavered over the same period.\n\nMassive buying interest at $18-$19\n\nOn Mobchart, the real-time order tracking platform, there was significant buying interest at $18 and $19. Large buy limit orders were placed at these levels on the Binance Exchange, as shown by the green lines. So, the price could bounce from these levels.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nOn the sell side, large sell limit orders were placed at the $22 level on the 4-hour timeframe. The inference from above is that a price reversal could occur when SOL edges closer to $22.\n\nSo, if BTC defends the range-low, SOL could aim at $22 or the 50% Fib level ($22.5). But bulls must clear the $20.2 hurdle (38.2% Fib level) to push forward in such an upswing scenario."

        "title": "Rune Causes a Stir With SVM-Appchain Proposal - Delphi Digital",
        "content": "Rune (Maker founder) caused quite a stir on CT the other day with his proposal to begin development on a Maker appchain based off of the Solana (SVM) codebase. This tweet has reached >1M views in a few short days and numerous discussions. First, a quick summary of what Rune is actually proposing:\n\n\u201cNewChain\u201d will be a standalone blockchain to handle Maker\u2019s back-end operations\n\nThis chain is not to be launched on Solana, but rather fork Solana and create a new L1 with its own validator set\n\nThis has sparked a lively discussion in the Maker forums over the past few days with people from various communities and ecosystems coming in to pitch their own solutions, from the Solana community being supportive or arguing why they should just launch on Solana, from Ethereum people asking why not an EVM rollup, to Eclipse suggesting an SVM rollup instead of an SVM L1, to Cosmos arguing why the Cosmos SDK\u2019s customizability is the ideal model for Maker.\n\nSo why an SVM L1? Rune argues Solana has a strong community of developers growing and technically superior to other options giving it the scale it needs. He also argues they need to be an L1 to fork, although as many others have pointed out this isn\u2019t strictly limited to an L1, sovereign rollups can also fork as well. But are these the real motives? I think Gabe had a good point here that may be hidden under all of the debate, if Rune wants to fork one of (if not the) most high performant chain then there must be a commercial motive as well.\n\nThis is where I believe we\u2019ll see a lot of DeFi protocols go, namely, trying to become a complete consumer finance app. This is the endgame for all the successful DeFi protocols. Think about Uniswap. Their recent shift with UniswapX is a move away from AMMs. Uniswap fillers don\u2019t even need to use Uniswap for their routing or filling orders. Add in the Uniswap wallet and it\u2019s clear what Uniswap is leveraging, their brand. I believe in a few years AMMs will not even be what Uniswap is known for the most; they\u2019re trying to be the killer consumer finance app and that means building off of their brand.\n\nAs a fun side-story, Vitalik sold some of his MKR shortly after Rune\u2019s post, which we don\u2019t have much to add other than to say it is indeed quite funny.\n\nFor Solana, regardless of what Maker decides it can\u2019t be looked at as anything other than a positive. Solana becoming one with the \u201cappchain thesis\u201d is definitely not a narrative they would pitch themselves, and to see it rise organically by external parties is absolutely a sign that they\u2019re doing something right. Even though this chain would not pay SOL in fees, or use SOL as the gas token (would use ETH or MKR), it adds to Solana\u2019s developer moat which, imo, is the most important metric when deciding if an L1 ecosystem is to \u201cmake it\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m sure there will be a lot of back and forth here, and this is merely a proposal at this stage, but it\u2019s an important one to follow; Maker is the OG DeFi app with arguably the most success, the only other in its category being Uniswap. The implications are not to be understated."

        "title": "MakerDAO and DAI Creator Proposes New Native Chain Based on Solana (SOL) Fork - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen is proposing that Maker (MKR) launch its own native blockchain based on the Solana (SOL) codebase.\n\nWriting in a new blog post, Christensen reveals plans for the fifth phase of \u201cEndgame,\u201d the long-term roadmap for Maker that was originally laid out in May of 2022.\n\nIn the post from May, Christensen said the fifth and final phase of Endgame was the launch of \u201cNewChain,\u201d a separate chain that houses backend security while interacting with Ethereum (ETH) through a \u201cstate of the art bridge.\u201d\n\nNow, Christen says that after researching, a Solana fork should be a candidate for NewChain.\n\n\u201cThe last phase of Endgame is the launch of a native blockchain for Maker with the codename NewChain.\n\nIt will make the ecosystem more secure and efficient\n\nAfter some research, I believe the Solana codebase should be considered as the basis for NewChain.\u201d\n\nChristensen names three reasons in particular why Solana is the most promising codebase for NewChain and one that should be explored further.\n\nSpecifically, the veteran crypto developer says that Solana presents high efficiency, along with an ecosystem galvanized by the collapse of FTX, plus a history of already successfully being forked, such as Pyth, the oracle solution.\n\n\u201cThe first reason is the technical quality of the Solana codebase, as it is highly optimized for the purpose of operating a singular, highly efficient blockchain, which is what NewChain requires. The Solana codebase is engineered well and benefits from being designed long after the bottlenecks and challenges of blockchains were already well understood, which fits nicely with the objective of NewChain itself in fixing the technical debt of Maker. Solana also already has two client implementations, which is crucial for resilience.\n\nThe second reason is that the Solana ecosystem has proven its resilience by having gone through the FTX blowup. Despite all of the issues and hardships, the project still has a thriving developer community. This means that it has a significant Lindy Effect and is likely to stick around long term and means that the costs for development and maintenance will be much lower and that there will always be a high-quality pool of talent available for Maker to access and contribute to.\n\nThe third reason is that there already exists examples of the Solana codebase being forked and adapted to act as appchains. Most notable is the Pyth project which runs its own adapted version of Solana to act as its backend.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMakerDAO\u2019s controversial endgame inches closer.\n\nA multi-year Maker protocol overhaul, dubbed \"Endgame,\" is reaching its final phase, according to protocol co-founder Rune Christensen\u2014setting the stage for the resurgence of a timeless rivalry.\n\n\u201cThe last phase of Endgame is the launch of a native blockchain for Maker with the codename NewChain,\u201d tweeted Christensen late Friday.\n\nThe crux of the controversy lies in the tweet\u2019s final words: \u201cAfter some research, I believe the Solana codebase should be considered as the basis for NewChain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOutlining three main reasons, Rune explained that it is due to the technical quality of the blockchain, as well as its resilience after the FTX blow up, and proven examples of Solana\u2019s codebase being forked for other successful projects.\n\nIf his preference comes to pass, it would mean that MakerDAO\u2014which up until now has lived on Ethereum\u2014will essentially migrate to a long-time rival.\n\nChristensen\u2019s endorsement of Solana sparked backlash on Crypto Twitter, with many users questioning the decision.\n\n\u201cFor your information,\u201d said one user, \u201cyour user base primarily has more allegiance to Ethereum,\u201d adding that Christensen \u201cshould probably give that more weight\u201d than he is.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum and Solana communities have been at each other's necks for years, with the latter\u2019s co-founder once appearing on CNBC to declare that \u201cEthereum is way too slow for peer-to-peer payments.\u201d\n\nThings have changed in 2023, however.\n\nAnatoly \u2018Toly\u2019 Yakovenko, Solana\u2019s co-founder, preemptively took to Twitter to stave off a possible attack from his own protocol's community.\n\nMaker considering @solana\u2019s tech is a win for open source, and has nothing to do with solana\u2019s mainnet or sol vs eth. I really hope that people in the @solana community don\u2019t use this as some cudgel to attack ethereum. \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) September 3, 2023\n\n\u201cMaker considering Solana\u2019s tech is a win for open source,\u201d he posted, adding that he \u201creally hope[s] that people in the community don\u2019t use this as some cudgel to attack Ethereum.\u201d\n\nYakovenko then went a step further and tweeted \u201cEthereum is awesome,\u201d and that a lot of Solana\u2019s tech stack was inspired by Ethereum\u2019s research and development. \u201cSolana wasn\u2019t built in a vacuum.\u201d\n\nSolana\u2019s co-founder pointed to proto-danksharding, an upcoming Ethereum upgrade that he considers \u201ca good design for a settlement layer.\u201d\n\nSome were quick to counter that he had \"gone soft\u201d on Ethereum. Another wrote, \"The mere utterance of Solana next to Maker is fascinating in itself. Excited to see their next steps.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToly\u2019s views were echoed by Matias Barrios, security researcher for Kudelski Security and a Solana programs auditor, who said he is surprised by the reaction of the Solana community. He claimed that he had not \u201cseen any mocking\u201d of Ethereum.\n\nAs he told Decrypt, \u201cChristensen\u2019s backing is an important validation [for Solana] coming from one of the strongest projects in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nBarrios said he agrees with Yakovenko\u2019s peace-keeping efforts, adding that \u201ctribalism is the worst we can do in innovation,\u201d and that \u201cEthereum and Solana are simply two different roads.\u201d\n\nNot to be sidelined by the possible reignition of rivalry, MakerDAO\u2019s Christensen also heeded Yakovenko\u2019s words of warning.\n\n\u201cEthereum is great, Solana is great. Cosmos is great,\u201d he posted on Saturday.\n\n\u201cAll chains are increasingly interconnected and synergize to form a global multi chain network economy,\u201d he wrote, concluding that \u201cTribalist incels (of every flavor) are in the wrong decade\u2014go back to Bitcoin and let the rest of us build.\""

        "content": "Solana is not as mainstream as Bitcoin and Ethereum, so the number of Solana casinos is naturally lower.\n\nHowever, our gambling experts have explored the market and tracked the very few best Solana casino sites that are worth using right now.
