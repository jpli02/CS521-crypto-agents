        "content": "Formfunction, a Solana-based NFT marketplace specializing in single-edition artwork, is closing down a year after raising $4.7 million in seed funding. The company announced that it will shutter its platform on March 29, without providing specific reasons for the decision. Formfunction\u2019s closure comes amid a turbulent NFT market, with falling trading volume and declining prices for assets.\n\nLaunched in February 2022, Formfunction boasted the third-largest weekly trading volume of any Solana NFT marketplace in November 2022. However, the total trading volume for Solana NFTs has been shrinking, with February 2023\u2019s volume down over 50 percent from January and significantly lower than March 2022\u2019s figure.\n\nThe NFT market has seen a shift in dynamics, with incumbent platforms having to compete with upstart marketplaces that have cut platform fees and artist royalties from secondary sales. This has made it increasingly challenging for NFT marketplaces like Formfunction to operate.\n\nWhile sales spiked again last month, much of this surge in activity came from traders on Ethereum NFT marketplace Blur, rapidly flipping assets to gain token rewards. This type of transaction has been dubbed \u201cwash trading\u201d by data startup CryptoSlam, though it does not precisely fit the traditional definition of wash trades."

        "title": "Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Crypto Break $22.6? - InvestingCube",
        "content": "Solana (SOLUSD) price has seen exponential growth in 2023. Since the start of the year, SOL crypto has surged by more than 135%, which makes it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies of this year. However, after explosive growth in the first two months of the year, the price has been showing weakness for the past few weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday, Solana crypto is trading at $22.3 after losing 1.07% till the start of the London session. Bitcoin and Ethereum are also trading sideways after showing minor losses. BTC is still fondling with the $28,000 resistance, which is its highest level in the last nine months.\n\nSolana Crypto To Remain Volatile This Week\n\nCryptocurrencies are having the most volatile month of the year as the failure of multiple banks has drastically affected the liquidity dynamics of the market. Bitcoin price has been the biggest gainer of the current banking crisis as its price is up 40% in just two weeks. Most other altcoins like SOL crypto and Ethereum are still lagging in the positive price action as the investors await the FOMC meeting.\n\nToday\u2019s FOMC meeting will conclude with the decision on interest rates and keep the Solana price in check. Many analysts are expecting another 25 basis points hike. It is also likely that the Federal Reserve will pause the rate hikes considering the recent bank failures in the US. However, considering the hawkish tone of the Fed in the last FOMC minutes, another rate hike seems to be more probable.\n\nSolana Price Is Retesting A Key Resistance\n\nAs shown in the following chart, the SOLUSD chart has formed a symmetrical wedge pattern. It is also visible on the chart that the price has failed to break out of the downward trendline despite multiple attempts. Furthermore, the price is also retesting the 200-day moving average, which currently lies at $22.60.\n\nThis is the most critical level and line in the sand for many traders. If today\u2019s DOMC meeting results in a pause in rate hikes, then I expect the price to break above $22.6. This will make Solana price prediction very bullish, and the price can retest the November high of $38.79. On the other hand, a 50 bps hike can send the price toward its March 2023 low of $16."

        "title": "How We Built Chainalysis' Robust Knowledge Graph for Solana Transactions - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "The Solana blockchain has several uniquely sophisticated features, including an account structure with system, token, and stake accounts, the ability to transfer funds by changing account ownership, and distinctive treatment of collateral in smart contracts. These characteristics can present challenges for investigators, compliance analysts, and other ecosystem participants seeking easy-to-understand models for transaction activity. Without a precise knowledge graph, anyone involved in blockchain analysis could reach incorrect conclusions.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll highlight how our research and development team accounted for Solana\u2019s defining characteristics to build out a robust knowledge graph of the blockchain and make investigation and compliance workflows more intuitive and fundamentally trusted.\n\nSolana\u2019s unique account structure and fund transfers through account ownership changes\n\nFirst, let\u2019s examine the account mechanics on Ethereum to better contextualize different account types in Solana.\n\nEthereum wallets support the storage of different types of assets, both fungible and non-fungible. An Ethereum wallet is represented by a single address, which is attributed to an entity or individual, and can be unlocked by a private key.\n\nUnlike Ethereum and other account-based blockchains, Solana has a unique account structure with multiple address types. Solana\u2019s primary addresses are known as System Account Addresses and they have control over all addresses beneath them. System Account Addresses are unlocked by private keys; the other remaining addresses within the wallet do not have designated private keys.\n\nUnder each System Account Address, there are two types of Inventory Account Addresses:\n\nStake Accounts are used to delegate tokens to network validators to potentially earn rewards. Token Accounts come in two forms: Ancillary Token Accounts hold SPL tokens (the equivalent of ERC20s ) or NFTs. Users can create as many of these accounts as they want. For example, a user could create multiple accounts that each hold an amount of e.g. USDC.\n\nAssociated Token Accounts are addresses designated for particular token mints. These accounts simplify SPL token transfers if recipients have multiple Ancillary Token Accounts with the same token. Additionally, users cannot send SPL tokens if recipients do not have Ancillary Token Accounts for the SPL tokens in question. Associated Token Accounts allow users to send SPL tokens even if recipients do not have Ancillary Token Accounts of that mint.\n\nTo create a knowledge graph for Solana, we employed our sophisticated blockchain analytics engine to carry out the clustering process, which we use to group together addresses controlled by the same real-world entity or service. Clustering allows us to start with a single address attributed to a custodian and scale up to identify millions of addresses controlled by that custodian, allowing our users to view more of the activity associated with that custodian. The clustering process typically consists of the following steps (see the below image representing the Chainalysis Clustering Engine for a visual representation):\n\nChainalysis operates full archival nodes and transforms the raw blockchain data retrieved from those nodes into structured and indexed blockchain data. We monitor and detect every interaction on the blockchain that is related to a value transfer. Our investigative team collects ground-truth identifications on individual services and businesses that operate on-chain. We also supplement this data with identifications shared by our network. We feed all of this information into our clustering engine. Hundreds of algorithms detect the unique fingerprint of a given service by analyzing the data produced in steps 1 and 2. We compare the outputs of all the algorithms in a Graph Traversal and Collision Resolution Engine to ensure internal consistency.\n\nIn Solana, clustering maps activity conducted by Token and Stake Accounts to their corresponding System Accounts and consolidates all System Accounts if they are controlled by the same on-chain entity. However, this process also needs to address how funds are transferred to ensure that both historical and current transactions are attributed to the correct owners.\n\nSolana provides two methods for transferring funds. The first involves simply transferring the tokens in question from one account to another, similar to transfers on Ethereum. The second process involves changing the associated ownership of a Token or Stake Account, which is more complicated. Any Solana tracing solution that doesn\u2019t account for this runs the risk of attributing the historical activity of an account\u2019s old owner to the new owner, posing a major problem for investigations.\n\nThe diagram below demonstrates an example of this phenomenon. On the left, we see all transactions conducted by Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s respective token accounts before any ownership changes. On the right, after Alice changes the ownership of her account and clustering is applied normally, Bob appears to inherit all of Alice\u2019s token account\u2019s historical transactions. This conclusion is inaccurate because Bob is now falsely associated with Alice\u2019s historical activity.\n\nFor SPL token transfers, changing account ownership is a rare phenomenon. We estimate that this occurs less than 1% of the time. For NFT transfers, we estimate that changing account ownership might occur more than 20% of the time, depending on the NFT marketplace involved. Even in the case of SPL token transfers, errors resulting from that 1% can have cascading effects on clustering.\n\nTo correctly map transactions and eliminate concerns regarding Solana\u2019s account complexities, we created specialized components that:\n\nmonitor the creation, closure, and activity of all Token and Stake Accounts.\n\ntrack all of their current and historical owners.\n\nmodel ownership changes as value transfers and roll those transfers up to the System Account level.\n\nWith these modifications, our Solana model is now similar to what customers see for Ethereum and other account-based blockchains.\n\nHow Solana treats collateral\n\nAnother challenge within Solana is its treatment of collateral. Solana accounts still technically hold collateral used to receive new assets in addition to the new assets themselves, resulting in double counting when wallet wealth is computed.\n\nBy default, this is how transactions involving SOL and wrapped SOL (wSOL) appear on the blockchain:\n\nThe interpretation of the above diagram leads to double counting of a single transaction reflected in the total balance of Wallet A. The inflation of a wallet\u2019s assets will lead to inaccurate conclusions about the amount of funds that can be recovered from an asset seizure or the size of exposure to a given entity. This is in stark contrast to Ethereum, where transactions involving deposited ETH to receive wETH are only counted once, and therefore do not require modifications.\n\nBlockchain Wallet Balance under native coin view Wallet Balance under wrapped token view Total Wallet Balance Ethereum 0 ETH 10 wETH 10 wETH Solana 10 SOL (collateral) 10 wSOL 10 SOL + 10 wSOL\n\nTo ensure collateral is not double-counted as part of a Solana wallet\u2019s wealth, our R&D team created a synthetic address to represent the \u201cescrow\u201d (the collateral contract). In Step 2 in the below diagram, the SOL collateral is moved to an escrow address, which omits double-counting.\n\nAdditional modifications for user-friendly Solana analysis\n\nNinety percent of transfers in Solana involve reward-rent, vote, or non-vote transaction fees. When investigators and analysts graph the transfers of a given entity, this high number of transactions would make it very difficult to see the small number of value transfers relevant to their research.\n\nThe Chainalysis R&D team tackled this obstacle by compressing the aforementioned transfers on Solana into a single synthetic transaction for each transaction type every 24 hours. This preserves the intelligence on these transfers while reducing unnecessary information for the user.\n\nHow Solana support impacts our customers\n\nAs new blockchain protocols are developed \u2013 each with unique characteristics \u2013 it will be necessary to tweak corresponding research and transaction models for greater efficiency and understanding. Solana support in our investigative suite demonstrates the importance of simple and accurate models to improve investigation and compliance within an otherwise complex network. Our research and development team was able to remove complexity of token account ownership changes by modeling and visualizing changes as value transfers, and map transfers to historical owners to provide accurate investigative conclusions and reliable risk calculations.\n\nMany of our customers have already begun using our Solana support for enhanced blockchain analysis. Maxim Piessen, Co-founder and CTO of Solana-based decentralized credit marketplace Credix, told us about how our support for Solana will help them. \u201cWorking with Chainalysis throughout their onboarding of Solana, we were really impressed with the rigor they apply to make sure accurate, actionable findings are surfaced. Advanced transaction monitoring and risk assessment are key to the trust and transparency of our platform; therefore, the reliability of the underlying data is paramount. As we continue to innovate and expand, our vision remains \u2013 to build the future of global credit markets.\u201d\n\nAt Chainalysis, we will continue to improve our product offerings and broaden our customer base for robust results.
