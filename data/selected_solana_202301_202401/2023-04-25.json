        "content": "The Solana Beach Schools Foundation (SBSF) hosted its first Major Donor Reception at Powerhouse Community Center on April 19. Against a beautiful ocean backdrop, the event honored families and San Diego businesses that contributed at the Major Donor level as part of the SBSF\u2019s inaugural year of its Major Donors Program. Business partners included two diamond level donors: Mission Pest Control & Tri Pointe Homes; One Platinum level donor: American Assets Trust; Two Gold level donors: Balfour Beatty, Shirin Ramos Realtors; and Four Silver level donors: Coastal Plastic Surgeons, Nicole Banks, Fusion Dance Solana Beach and Kumon math and reading.\n\nThe reception also celebrated the Solana Beach School District\u2019s (SBSD) Discovery Labs \u2014 weekly enrichment classes offered to all students in the district. The SBSF raises funds to help support Discovery Lab classes, including: STREAM, Art, Technology and Physical Education. Attendees enjoyed presentations by SBSD Superintendent Jodee Brentinger, as well as district alumni from the Brainy Builders First Lego League Team and current Stanford undergraduates Ryan Clairmont and Eva Geierstanger.\n\nIn-kind staff support was provided by Crust Pizzeria Solana Beach.\n\nSBSD offers exceptional programs, experiences and a long tradition of rigorous academics as well as social-emotional support designed to maximize learning for each student in pre-kindergarten through 6th grade. Families often relocate to be within the school district\u2019s borders so that their children could be a part of the outstanding curriculum, its innovative and experiential learning opportunities.\n\n\u201cMy 6-year-old loves going to school, he especially enjoys the unbelievable STREAM and Discovery Lab\u201d said Andres Falabella, parent and major donor at Solana Highlands.\n\n\u201cWe love supporting SBSD, we do whatever we can to help young students that we got to know from attending our dance studio,\u201d said owner Justin Quandt from Fusion Dance Solana Beach.\n\nAll donations, big and small, help SBSD create a learning environment where students can thrive and reach their full potential. Every donation is an investment in the future of students and education at SBSD schools. Donations are greatly appreciated and tax deductible.

        "content": "A veteran of the crypto space thinks one layer-1 blockchain offers slept-on opportunities not seen elsewhere in the markets.\n\nChris Burniske, a partner at the venture capital firm Placeholder, says that Solana\u2019s (SOL) non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem is unique in that the cost to mint NFTs is drastically lower than other chains.\n\n\u201cPeople still sleeping on the fact it costs ~$200 to mint & deliver NFTs to 10,000,000 users on Solana using state compression, a couple orders of magnitude cheaper than its closest peers.\u201d\n\nThe former ARK Invest analyst says the viral growth of the Solana NFT distribution platform Drip Haus is an indicator of Solana\u2019s NFT power.\n\n\u201cViral growth like what Drip Haus is seeing should give you an indication of what happens when users can be reached for ~1/1000th of a cent.\u201d\n\nBurniske also believes NFTs will become way more mainstream in the future, and predicts the digital assets will one day be \u201cubiquitous.\u201d\n\n\u201cNFTs in 2021 were expensive and exclusive \u2014 in the coming years, they\u2019ll become ubiquitous, driving experimentation at the bleeding edge of \u201ccreation <> audience\u201d connection.\u201d\n\nBurniske has been a consistent believer in Solana, one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) top rivals. In February, he said the smart contract platform was both contentious and undervalued.\n\n\u201cI think if I had to pick an ecosystem that\u2019s contentious and that you should pay attention to, and in its contentiousness is undervalued, it would be Solana. Placeholder, each bear market, tends to pick an ecosystem or two and build an aircraft carrier strategy around that ecosystem. And so the last bear [market], it was ETH and Bitcoin, because those were really the only things at scale and liquid enough to justify.\n\nAnd what I mean by aircraft carrier \u2013 if you take Ethereum, buy a bunch of the core ETH asset, but then venture invest around it and really get to know that ecosystem and who all the people are that are working on say, at that point in time, lending or DEXs [decentralized exchanges] or asset management or whatever. And then you can pick the best teams of the teams that most speak to you from a venture perspective. We\u2019re doing that exact same aircraft carrier strategy around Cosmos and Solana right now.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Google Cloud announced on Tuesday a wide-ranging set of partnerships to attract Web3 startups to its cloud computing platform.\n\nExpanding upon Google for Startups Cloud, an existing initiative that provides startups free credits to use the tech behemoth\u2019s servers, among other perks, the new program will include specific benefits for emerging Web3 companies.\n\nThese include access to a set of grants from \u200b\u200bAptos, Celo, Flow, the HBAR Foundation, Near, and the Solana Foundation, all of which have separately offered up $1 million\u2014for a total of $6 million\u2014to support Web3 startups building on Google Cloud. Nansen, a blockchain data analytics firm, has also pitched in, offering discounts to startups on its analytics products. And Alchemy, a Web3 developer platform, will provide members credits to the platform\u2019s suite of services, mentorship, and priority access to its Web3 boot camp.\n\n\u201cOur new benefits give Web3 projects and startups the technology, community, and resources that they need to focus on innovation over infrastructure,\u201d James Tromans, Google Cloud\u2019s Web3 engineering director, and Ryan Kiskis, director of Google Cloud\u2019s Startup Ecosystem, wrote in a post announcing the new effort.\n\nOther perks include early access to Google Cloud\u2019s Web3 products as well as priority review for Coinbase\u2019s Base Ecosystem Fund, which supports projects planning to build on Base, the company\u2019s recently announced layer-2 blockchain. (The cloud computing giant included a comprehensive list of partnerships in a blog post announcing the program.)\n\n\u201cFrom their perspective maybe it\u2019s a low-risk one,\u201d Andrew Thurman, a spokesperson for Nansen, told Fortune in reference to Google Cloud\u2019s Web3 startup program. \u201cThey\u2019re offering free Google Cloud credits and really just organizing as a nexus for many of these services and protocols. But it\u2019s sort of undeniable that this is one of the bolder steps they\u2019ve taken into the blockchain space.\u201d\n\nThe program builds on more than a year of momentum from Google\u2019s cloud computing arm as it looks to edge out Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, the other two titans of cloud computing, in attracting a growing field of Web3 developers to Google\u2019s servers.\n\nWhile Google Cloud took its first public step into Web3 in 2018 when it added datasets for Bitcoin and eventually other blockchains into BigQuery, a method for developers to ping large databases, it accelerated its Web3 strategy when it announced the creation of its own dedicated digital assets and Web3 engineering teams in 2022.\n\nSince then, the cloud computing giant has announced a near-constant stream of partnerships with prominent crypto firms and blockchains, including Coinbase, BNB Chain, Celo, and Casper Labs.\n\nIt has also offered up its servers as validators, or computers that help secure and maintain blockchains, for the Sky Mavis, Solana, and Tezos blockchains.\n\nAnd in October, it unveiled the Blockchain Node Engine, a streamlined method for developers to access and use blockchains on Google\u2019s servers.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s partnership is crucial in realizing Web3\u2019s potential,\u201d Mo Shaikh, cofounder and CEO of Aptos Labs, said in a statement to Fortune."

        "content": "NEW YORK, April 25, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Backpack, the creators of Anchor , the most popular Solana development framework, today announced the completed launch of Backpack 's first xNFT (executable NFT) collection, Mad Lads .\n\n\n\nThe Mad Lads launch shattered all previous records of 24 hour volume on Solana on April 21, reaching a peak of $8.2 million , almost three times that of Bored Ape Yacht Club's corresponding 24 hour volume ( $3 million ), bringing Solana's 24 hour NFT trading volume to >50% of Ethereum's total 24 hour NFT volume for the first time.\n\n\n\nMad Lads were introduced as the cultural complement to Backpack's tech. With the mission of onboarding non-crypto natives, generating demand, and becoming a proof point for showcasing how NFTs can also be decentralized apps.\n\n\n\nShowcasing the power of xNFTs, each Mad Lads collectible serves as a clickable ticket into the Mad Lads story, granting access to anything the creators behind the collection choose to offer the holders. Typically, NFT enthusiasts have been forced to use various platforms associated with their NFT, such as chat programs and verification softwares, but in the case of xNFTs, users can access all the needed avenues without ever leaving Backpack.\n\nArmani Ferrante, CEO and co-founder of Backpack, commented: \"The Mad Lads xNFTs sit at the intersection of technology and culture. The collection has garnered enormous support from the Solana community and serves as an illustration of what NFTs can be. From loyalty cards from major retailers to hubs for music artists to share their newest tracks, the token-gated experiences that can be brought to users are endless. This is a massive improvement to how users interact with protocols and smart contracts today.\"\n\n\"Backpack has been at the forefront of innovation of cryptocurrency wallets. xNFTs are the fastest way for developers to get distribution for their front ends and the Mad Lads collection will be their bridge to a mass consumer audience, WAO,\" stated Anatoly Yakovenko, CEO of Solana Labs and Co-Founder of Solana.\n\nBackpack is an interactive, first-of-its-kind open-source wallet that delivers crypto-native experiences through xNFTs. xNFTs act as native decentralized applications within Backpack\u2014any user with an xNFT in their wallet can launch the application or experience within that xNFT. xNFTs represent a portal to applications, games, and assets built on any chain, and users can finally access all of their assets and dApps (decentralized apps) natively in one place. xNFTs will also live in Solana Mobile's Saga app store. Backpack currently supports Solana and Ethereum.\n\nBackpack has been in private beta since September 2022, with 70,000 users currently utilizing the platform. As of today, it is officially open to the public. Developers are encouraged to create new xNFT app experiences for Backpack using a web stack of their choice and publishing to the app store xnft.gg . Creators are encouraged to create xNFT collections that do away with the current complexities of token gating. Other projects that have already launched an xNFT on Backpack include Jito, Aurory, Solend, Defi Land, Frakt, Squads, AssetDash, Audius, and Amulet amongst many others.\n\nTo learn more about Backpack, and xNFTs, please visit https://www.backpack.app/ .\n\nAbout Backpack\n\nBackpack is the technology company developing Anchor, the most popular Solana development framework, Backpack wallet, and the xNFT protocol.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nM Group Strategic Communications\n\n[email protected]\n\nSOURCE Backpack"
