        "title": "Solana price prediction as SOL gains 20% in a week - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Solana (SOL) has recently experienced substantial gains, particularly over the past week, as the decentralized finance (DeFi) asset shows strong momentum in its upward trajectory.\n\nThe price of SOL is approaching a critical threshold, with the cryptocurrency aiming to surpass the crucial $20 barrier. Investors and market observers closely monitor Solana\u2019s price movement as it strives to break through this key resistance level and continue its upward ascent.\n\nFinbold\u2019s in-depth analysis reveals SOL stands at a price of $19.31, displaying a modest yet notable increase of 1.02% within the span of 24 hours. However, the real story unfolds over the course of the past week, where Solana experienced an impressive surge of 20.87%.\n\nSOL 1-week price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nSolana is ranked ninth with a positive performance compared to the token sale price, with 18 green days in the last 30 days (60%).\n\nOver the course of the past year, SOL has also faced a considerable decline of -46%, lagging behind 86% of the top 100 crypto assets during this period. This perspective highlights the need for caution and a holistic evaluation when assessing Solana\u2019s long-term performance.\n\nSOL prediction\n\nBased on CoinCodex\u2019s Solana price prediction, the price of SOL will decrease by -11.01% and reach $ 17.16 by July 10, 2023.\n\nSOL 5-day prediction. Source: CoinCodex\n\nHowever, 1 month from now, Solana\u2019s price is predicted to trade at $25.52 based on technical quantitative indicators.\n\nAccording to the platform\u2019s technical indicators, the current sentiment is \u2018Bearish\u2019 while the Fear & Greed Index is showing 61 (Greed). Technical indicators reveal a potential cause for vigilance. Trading below the 200-day simple moving average, Solana shows signs of being overbought, suggesting a possible impending correction in the market.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "\u201cWe are pleased to partner with Kratos RES to help its electricity end-consumers achieve their sustainability goals and transition their power supply to renewable energy,\u201d said Vicente Perez Jr, chair of Alternergy and chair and president of Solana Solar.\n\nShould the project be completed as planned, it will significantly increase Alternergy\u2019s footprint in the Philippines. Currently, the company operates a 12.5MWp solar farm on the island of Mindanao, alongside a 5MW rooftop solar project that generates power for the CityMalls chain of shopping centres.\n\nThe PPA will also bring together a number of companies, with groups connected to both Solana Solar and Kratos RES to be involved in the deal. Solana Solar is a subsidiary of the Solar Pacific Energy Corporation, itself a subsidiary of Alternergy, while Kratos is part of Prime Asset Ventures, itself a subsidiary of Israeli construction company Villar.\n\nWhile both the project under construction and the PPA signed involve a small total power capacity, the deal is an encouraging demonstration of the viability of multi-party arrangements for solar power in the Philippines. Alternergy also announced, for instance, that it received additional funding for the project from \u201ca leading Philippine commercial bank\u201d and \u201ca leading [engineering, procurement and construction] provider\u201d.\n\nThe news is the latest encouraging development for solar power in the Philippines, which has seen considerable investment in recent years. Between 2012 and 2022, the total capacity of solar power installed in the country leaped from 2MW to 1.6GW, and the continued construction of small-scale solar will only add to this trend.\n\nElsewhere in the Philippines, the Solar Philippines Neva Ecija Corporation has announced plans to start work on a mammoth 3.5GW solar farm in the country later this year. The project would be the largest single solar farm in the world, and would singularly alter the nature of solar power in the Philippines, should it live up to its potential."

        "title": "How To Earn $100 Per Day In Crypto Passive Income Using Ethereum, Solana & Caged Beasts? - Coin Rivet",
        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\n\u2018Money doesn\u2019t grow on trees!\u2019 You couldn\u2019t have reached your twenties without listening to this phrase at least once! It is still used as a cautionary reminder to instill some financial responsibility in young people. However, it\u2019s time to debunk this notion!\n\nWhile there may not be a literal \u201cmoney plant,\u201d there are indeed ways to cultivate wealth. All it takes is choosing the right path. In this article, we will assist you in making that choice by explaining how to generate $100 per day through crypto passive income using Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Caged Beasts (BEASTS).\n\nBuild Your Wealth with Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH) requires no introduction in the world of cryptocurrencies, as it holds the position of the second-largest crypto with a market capitalization of $225 billion. What do you think has contributed to Ethereum\u2019s exponential growth in value? The answer is simple: it\u2019s potential to generate high returns on investment and provide various avenues for passive income. Among the most profitable methods is staking ETH tokens.\n\nETH tokens hold significant value in the crypto market, making staking them a highly rewarding endeavour. It offers an impressive annual percentage yield of approximately 6.3% \u2013 7.31%. By selecting a reputable and credible crypto platform for staking your Ethereum tokens, you can even earn an additional 1 or 2% yield.\n\nAlways remember that staking cryptocurrencies yields greater returns compared to depositing money in traditional banks. Furthermore, the yield for staking increases based on the market value of ETH tokens, providing you with an opportunity to earn significantly more through saving rather than solely relying on trading!\n\nEasy Way to Earn More with Solana\n\nIf you think that Ethereum tokens are beyond your financial reach, don\u2019t worry! There are numerous alternatives available in the crypto realm, and one of them is Solana (SOL)\u2014a blockchain platform with a focus on web3 infrastructure.\n\nThe current valuation of the Web3 blockchain market stands at $2.86 billion and is projected to reach $116 billion in the next 10 years. Therefore, owning Solana tokens would be a wise decision, at least for the next decade.\n\nNow, let\u2019s explore how to earn passive income using Solana. Once again, staking takes a prominent position. A year ago, the renowned crypto exchange platform Binance offered a 9-13% annual percentage yield (APY) for SOL staking, while Phantom offered a slightly lower range of 6-7%. Additionally, SOL lending yielded a 3.6% return.\n\nAlthough the yield values have decreased slightly over the past year, as Web3 technology continues to grow, the value of SOL tokens will also increase, multiplying the yield value for staking SOL.\n\nLet the Beasts Make Money for You\n\nCaged Beasts is an innovative crypto project that is about to launch its presale very soon. This exciting new meme coin has been making a splash in the crypto world, thanks to its captivating storyline, community-driven approach, and generous referral program.\n\nThe Caged Beasts team is dedicating their time and effort to creating engaging competitions, events, and special offers that will attract more customers to join their brand-new community.\n\nAs a first step in this direction, the Caged Beasts team has introduced a referral program that grants a 20% bonus to both the user and their referral. Let\u2019s say your referral invests $500, you will receive a $100 commission, and your referral will also earn bonus tokens worth $100. This means both of you will benefit and potentially become wealthier at the same time.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEarning $100 per day in crypto passive income is achievable, but it does require a significant investment. However, if you\u2019re unable to invest a substantial amount, you can still invest in Ethereum, Solana, Caged Beasts, or all of them gradually, earning small amounts without exerting excessive effort. Over time, your investment will grow to the point where it can generate more than $100 per day.\n\nFind out more about Caged Beasts (BEASTS):\n\nWebsite: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

        "title": "Crypto: liquid staking rising strongly on Solana - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The total value locked on liquid staking crypto protocols is rising on Solana\u2019s blockchain: the trend is expanding outside Ethereum as well.\n\nAs a result of the Shapella update and the integration of LST tokens within DeFi, this niche market has been wildly successful, culminating in contagion on Solana.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at all the details together.\n\nSolana crypto: liquid staking platform activity on the rise\n\nThe trend of liquid staking crypto platforms has also arrived on Solana, leading to an uptick in TVL for this kind of protocol.\n\nParticularly in the first half of 2023, we have seen a substantial increase in total value locked, sparking particular interest from the decentralized finance audience.\n\nLiquid staking applications allow users to take advantage of returns offered by staking platforms (such as Ethereum 2.0) while taking advantage of alternative liquidity, known as LST tokens.\n\nThis mechanism has been highly appreciated by users in the Solana ecosystem, who have deposited about $89 million since the beginning of the year as a result, marking a 91% increase.\n\nIn total, about 1.66 million SOL have been blocked, corresponding to $31 million, plus a whole range of tokens involved in liqudity providing processes such as USDT, USDC, wLDO, stSOL and WETH.\n\nIt is very interesting to note that of the 270 million TVL allocated on ALL protocols in the Solana network, 69% of this amount is locked precisely into liquid staking protocols.\n\nKevin Peng, research analyst at blockchain analytics firm The Block believes that the Shapella update in April, which allowed the unstake of previously deposited ETH on the Beacon Chain, has been a catalyst for the growth of the entire industry.\n\nThese are his words:\n\n\u201cOverall, LSDs have grown as a category across crypto in 2023 in large part due to the new dynamics around staking on Ethereum, though demand for these products has trickled into the Solana ecosystem as well.\u201d\n\nThe best liquid staking dApps on Solana and Ethereum\n\nLet\u2019s now analyze in detail which liquid staking crypto platforms are the most in vogue on the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems.\n\nStarting with Solana, we can easily observe that Marinade Finance, according to data from DefiLlama, represents the most used protocol in the community with $125 million in TVL, representing a total market share of 62%.\n\nNext we find Lido, which with $55 million manages 27% of the capital placed in this niche.\n\nThen in lesser presence are Jito, JPool and Socean, which collectively encompass $24.9 million.\n\nAs for Marinade Finance, it is curious to note that despite the strength expressed on the Solana network, it has lost a great deal of capital since November 2021, where the TVL was $1.8 billion.\n\nThe onset of the bear market, and later the collapse of FTX, decreed a downsizing of this protocol and the entire ecosystem of DeFi applications on Solana.\n\nOn Ethereum the situation is different: while we see low activity in decentralized finance compared to the values recorded at the height of the bear market, we can see how liquid staking platforms have grown quite a bit in recent months.\n\nLido on Ethereum concentrates most of its firepower, where it represents DeFi\u2019s largest decentralized application, with a TVL of as much as $14.7 billion.\n\nAs of early 2023 there has been impressive growth for this protocol, which as anticipated earlier, has benefited from the unstake of ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe other most used LSD platforms on Vitalik Buterin\u2018s chain are Coinbase wrapped staking with $2.2 billion, Rocket Pool with $1.9 billion, Frax with $453 million, Stakewise with $177 million, and Ankr with $93 million.\n\nIt is worth noting how all these applications do not exceed the numbers recorded by Lido overall, which remains the undisputed leader in the industry, with high growth prospects for the coming months.\n\nIntegration of liquid staking tokens into DeFi\n\nThe use of liquid staking platforms has become very intense since the beginning of this year, partly due to the integration that has emerged between LST tokens and the main DeFi platforms.\n\nUntil recently, in fact, those who deposited assets in these protocols could only use the liquidity provided to them to trade on decentralized markets or to be transferred to exchanges.\n\nNow, however, thanks to the creation of several liquidity pools in DeFi and the integration of this token with lending platforms, the attractiveness to this kind of financial product has become significantly higher.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2018s data, this is a key value proposition for LS tokens, which have found a very attractive match for investors, who can leverage their liquidity while getting returns for staking.\n\nTake lending pools such as Aave and Compound as an example: the Aave stETH/wstETH pool has grown by leaps and bounds since the beginning of the year, with total current liquidity at $2.53 billion.\n\nInvestors have appreciated the ability to borrow coins by providing the same liquid token received from Lido as collateral.\n\nWe can also observe the same trend on Compound: the wstETH pool as of May has experienced an impressive growth of 817%, now holding about $42.2 million in counter value.\n\nIt seems that LST derivatives are becoming more attractive in the DeFi arena not only than the more capitalized cryptocurrencies such as ETH and WBTC, but also than stablecoins, historically the most widely used in these contexts."

        "title": "Bitcoin dips to trade flat; Solana gains; Polygon, BNB lead losers - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether traded little changed on Wednesday morning in Asia, while the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. Bitcoin fell back under US$31,000, but its dominance in total crypto market cap is gaining, a sign of market recovery. Solana added to its gains this week, while Polygon\u2019s Matic and the BNB tokens led the daily losers list. Bitcoin Cash has taken the number 12 spot in the list of top tokens by market cap after its listing on the new EDX Markets exchange.\n\nCrypto price pause\n\nBitcoin fell 1.0% over the last 24 hours to US$30,801 at 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, shaving its weekly gain down to 0.39%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. On Tuesday, the price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, on the back of optimism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications by a raft of Wall Street heavyweights, including Blackrock.\n\nThe level of Bitcoin dominance sits near 50%, which is the highest since April 2021. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, says this price uptrend in Bitcoin is a typical market recovery pattern in which the most significant asset in the sector attracts buyers first.\n\n\u201cIt will probably take about a year of Bitcoin price recovery before crypto enthusiasts start looking for one with higher risk, pushing altcoins higher and leading to a new wave of capitalisation swell,\u201d said Kuptsikevich, in an email statement. He said he doesn\u2019t see altcoins rallying before November.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent price recovery was sparked by Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, filing an application last month to launch a Bitcoin ETF and refiling it again after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated it lacked details.\n\nSeveral other U.S.-based asset managers, such as Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree, have filed their own Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting mainstream finance recognizes the Bitcoin opportunity and wants to offer clients the access to its price movements without actually owning the token.\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, looked to be on a run to break US$2,000 this week, but fell back 0.81% to US$1,941 today after a gain of 2.64% for the past seven days.\n\nThe other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization traded mixed to flat, with Solana leading gainers with a 2.0% rise to US$19.45. The token has surged 15.35% in the past week.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic and Binance\u2019s BNB token were amongst the losers \u2014 Matic lost 1.99% to US$0.6981, though it\u2019s still up 4.29% for the week. BNB lost 1.68% to US$242.83, cutting its weekly gain to 1.81%.\n\nAltcoins have suffered from the SEC\u2019s crackdown on tokens that they deem financial securities. Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB were among those that the regulator named as unregistered securities in its lawsuits filed against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges in early June.\n\nWhile these altcoins have partially recovered after an initial plunge following the SEC suits, several trading platforms including California-based Robinhood Markets Inc., Israel-based eToro and UK\u2019s Revolut ceased support or limited access to some of these tokens for their U.S.-based customers.\n\nBitcoin Cash climbed to become the twelfth largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap at US$53.8 billion. The Bitcoin spin-off is one of the four cryptocurrencies listed on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed, compliance-focused crypto exchange that launched on June 20 in the U.S.\n\nBitcoin Cash had a market capitalization of US$20.6 billion and was valued at US$106.34 on June 19. It has since surged 160% to US$276.87. It dipped 1.70% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 0.80% to US$1.21 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 22.22% to US$31.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAzuki dents NFT sentiment\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.28% in the 24 hours to 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,783.58, but logged a loss of 3.17% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets rose.\n\nHowever, despite moderate gains in the indexes on Wednesday morning, the NFT market overall remains in a downtrend, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects declining sales prices across collections on all chains, but it\u2019s Ethereum that\u2019s really dragging the market down with it,\u201d said Petscher, pointing to the recent problems with the Azuki NFT collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki\u2019s struggles exasperated the already struggling market \u2026 Azuki\u2019s new Elementals mint was supposed to be a boom for NFTs and instead was a bust, becoming a catalyst that drove NFT collections down to all-time lows.\u201d\n\nAzuki NFT creator Chiru Labs debuted its latest Elementals collection last Tuesday, to much negative response from the community, who deemed it almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nWhile the team behind Azuki posted an public apology to buyers on Twitter, dissatisfied Azuki holders formed the Azuki DAO last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO.\n\nLegalDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization formed in 2020 by a group of legal professionals, said Tuesday that it will help Azuki DAO in the effort to claim the 20,000 ETH.\n\nBy NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the trading volume rankings on Cryptoslam with US$3 million, but the volume was down 18.97% on the day. Mutant Ape Yacht Club, another Yuga Labs\u2019 Ethereum-based collection, saw its volume grow 11.94% to US$2.39 million to place second in the rankings.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 9.24% to US$31.5 million. Volume on Ethereum fell 9.17% to US$22.7 million according to Cryptoslam data. Volume on the Bitcoin network gained 3.73% to US$3.19 million, while volumes on Polygon, Solana and BNB all plunged.\n\nU.S. equity futures drop during holiday\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures dipped as of 10:45 a.m. in Hong Kong ahead of the restart of trading in the U.S. following the July 4 public holiday.\n\nFutures on all three indexes \u2013 Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq \u2013 declined but by less than 1%.\n\nAsian equities opened lower Wednesday morning. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.5%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dipped 1.3%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index edged down 0.3%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi also lost 0.08%.\n\nThe Caixin China General Composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2014 a measure of the performance of both the manufacturing and services sectors in China \u2014 dropped to 52.5 in June from 55.6 the previous month. This marks the sixth consecutive month of expansion for China\u2019s private sector. However, the growth rate was the slowest since January.\n\nEmployment in China also returned to growth, as the service sector created more jobs following a drop in manufacturing payrolls, according to Trading Economics.\n\nIn the U.S., New York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. The Fed will also release its June meeting minutes on Wednesday, where it decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, down from 89.9% on Tuesday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 12.6%.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"
