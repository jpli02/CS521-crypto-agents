        "content": "Solana Beach author Shelby Stanger is coming out with a new book about \u201chow we can use adventure to change our mindset.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill to Wild: Adventures Great and Small to Change Your Life,\u201d published by Simon and Schuster, will be released on June 6. The author will also be holding a book signing at 7:30 p.m. June 6 at Warwick\u2019s in La Jolla, followed by a TEDx talk on June 11 at the Conrad in La Jolla.\n\n\u201cWill to Wild: Adventures Great and Small to Change Your Life\u201d book cover by Shelby Stanger. (Shelby Stanger)\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things you can do right now to change your life, but I think choosing an adventure is the most exciting way,\u201d said Stanger, who grew up in North County and has lived in Solana Beach for the last eight years. \u201cAnd the side effects of nature are profound.\u201d\n\nOver the years through her writings, podcasting and other content, Stanger has interviewed countless people who have pursued adventures big and small. Her new book details the feats of a suburban mom who became an ice-climbing guide, a group of boogie boarding women ages 56 to 96, surfers, paddle boarders, runners and many other case studies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve interviewed thousands of people who have pursued adventure,\u201d said Stanger who has participated in many adventures all over the world herself. \u201cI really believe that adventure is a great catalyst to transform your life, even if it\u2019s a small adventure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill to Wild\u201d has been included on the Next Big Idea Club\u2019s June 2023 Must-Read Books list.\n\nInspiration for the book also goes back to when Stanger was 16 and teaching surf lessons at an all-girls surf school in La Jolla Shores. Many of the women contacted her down the road to let her know that they found the confidence to make a big move across the country, end a relationship or take other meaningful steps in their lives.\n\n\u201cI think that phenomenon stuck with me so much that I kind of accidentally made it my life\u2019s work to study people who pursued adventure and wild ideas full time,\u201d Stanger said. \u201cAnd so this book is everything I\u2019ve learned about it. It\u2019s a guidebook on how to take a wild idea from just an idea to actually making it happen.\u201d\n\nStanger\u2019s previous projects include the podcast \u201cWild Ideas Worth Living,\u201d which became an REI Co-op production.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been blown away by how even a little adventure can transform someone\u2019s life,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWill to Wild\u201d will be available in multiple formats on June 6.

        "title": "Solana (SOL) ready to initiate a new rally, according to Raoul Pal - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 26 May 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C.\n\nRaoul Pal, the founder of Real Vision, former Goldman Sachs executive, and macroeconomics expert, recently shared his optimism about Solana (SOL) in the latest edition of the Global Macro Investor (GMI) newsletter. Drawing on his technical analysis expertise, Pal remains convinced that Solana is on the verge of a significant uptrend.\n\nThe reversal of Solana\u2019s trend\n\nSolana (SOL), a cryptocurrency that competes with Ethereum (ETH) and currently ranks 11th in terms of market capitalization, seems to have completed its consolidation period and is gearing up for a bullish trend.\n\nLet\u2019s go back in time to understand Solana\u2019s evolution. In November 2021, its price reached dizzying heights, nearly touching $260, giving investors a sense of power. But since then, a steep plunge followed, causing the price of the SOL token to drop to nearly $20. In other words, a devaluation of about 92.6%. However, all hope is not lost.\n\nRaoul Pal, the former Goldman Sachs executive and macroeconomics expert, remains upbeat and optimistic about Solana\u2019s future. According to his analysis, this cryptocurrency is currently in a consolidation phase after successfully breaking out of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, signaling a trend reversal.\n\nSolana looks like it\u2019s getting ready to make its next move higher after a period of consolidation following the inverse H&S breakout in April. Solana was a big bet at GMI this year and is up nearly 150% YTD\u2026 Raoul Pal\n\nIndeed, since the start of 2023, Solana has been following a general upward trend. Its price has gone from $9.87 to $19.50 at the time of writing this article, representing a growth of approximately 120%.\n\nSolana price chart. Source: Raoul Pal/Global Macro Investor\n\nPredictions on global stocks\n\nIn addition to Solana, Raoul Pal also discusses global stocks in his newsletter. According to him, these stocks appear ready for a rebound, forming a bullish pattern.\n\nIn particular, if the All Country World Index (ACWI) manages to break through a key resistance level, global stocks could reach new highs. The ACWI index measures the performance of large and mid-cap stocks in developed and emerging markets.\n\nGlobal equities just look like the mirror image of the DXY and appear to be forming a large head-and-shoulders bottom. We\u2019re very close to a potential breakout now and the small bullish pennate that has formed on the right shoulder looks like just the boost needed to get us over the line. If we break 94, the measured move is new highs\u2026 Raoul Pal\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these statements do not constitute investment advice in any way. It is crucial to conduct your own thorough research before venturing into the world of cryptocurrencies. Before acquiring your first cryptos, take the time to educate yourself, analyze trends. And understand the potential risks associated with them.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Will Solana's Metaplex Fees Push Developers Back to Ethereum? - Blockworks",
        "content": "One of the biggest selling points of Solana\u2019s ecosystem is its low cost of utility for NFTs, especially when compared to its gas guzzling rival, Ethereum.\n\nBut even on the svelte blockchain platform, development still requires funding.\n\nIn an effort to cover some of these costs, dominant Solana NFT protocol Metaplex introduced a controversial network fee in its \u201cToken Metadata immutability plan,\u201d resulting in angry calls for forks and general discontent among its community.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Metaplex promptly back-pedaled from initial plans, removing some, but not all of the proposed fees. The company stated via Twitter that updates, verifications, freezes and thaws would remain free as costs \u201ccould prohibit important and emergent use cases.\u201d\n\nCo-hosts Garrett Harper and Santiago Santos discussed the fee furor and the possibility that it might draw some developers back to Ethereum in a Blockworks interview on the Empire podcast.\n\nMetaplex as a public good\n\nHarper notes that Metaplex \u201cspun out of Solana Labs,\u201d raising $46 million, which he estimates is the third-largest raise in Solana\u2019s ecosystem from an individual project.\n\n\u201cI think people thought, in general, this was gonna be a public good.\u201d\n\nVirtually all Solana NFTs \u2014 around 99.9% according to a company blog post \u2014 adopted the Metaplex standard, Harper says, \u201cbut the issue is now that they\u2019re adding fees on top of this, people are like, okay, we\u2019re gonna have to fork this.\u201d\n\nProblem being, that\u2019s not really a feasible solution, Harper explains. \u201cThey have a license where it says it\u2019s open source, but you can\u2019t actually fork it\u201d to alleviate the fee problem.\n\nStephen Hess, the CEO of Metaplex, previously told Blockworks that \u201c\u200b\u200bit\u2019s acceptable under the license for anyone to fork Metaplex programs even for a competitive use case, provided the fork isn\u2019t removing, replacing or modifying the fees.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s used by all these NFTs. It\u2019s adopted by the exchanges and also wallets,\u201d Harper says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a lot of work to build and maintain the code,\u201d he says, suggesting the company needs at least some fees to sustain a viable business model.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, the company explains that proceeds from creator fees \u201cwill be used to fund dev work on the Token Metadata immutability roadmap as well as the broader suite of Metaplex programs (Candy Machine, Auction House, Compressed NFTs) and dev tools (SDKs, Amman, Umi, Solita).\u201d\n\nWill fees hinder development?\n\nHarper explains that one of the problems for Solana, when compared to Ethereum, is that it lacks protocol standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721. \u201cSo today, the program\u2019s just set by Metaplex and that\u2019s what\u2019s become the standard.\u201d\n\nSantos wonders if the fee introduction might hinder NFT development on the competing platform. Such a move, he says, \u201cdegrades the interest in the broader Solana ecosystem of onboarding users.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, public goods need to be funded in some capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re adding the taxation layer on top of it,\u201d Santos says, which \u201cadds another layer of difficulty when you\u2019re trying to tell projects and users that they\u2019re gonna be taxed for something that they\u2019re usually not used to being taxed on in other ecosystems like Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt becomes an even greater problem of competition and really low barriers to entry,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a new NFT project, this actually changes the landscape of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the cool things about Solana,\u201d Santos observes, is that \u201cthey do move so fast, and that\u2019s one of their core advantages. But you can see an issue in scenarios like this where that can actually be a bad thing.\u201d\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s mainnet development moves at a much slower pace than Solana\u2019s, layer-2 developments offer low-cost and rapidly evolving solutions, which \u201callows Ethereum to still innovate in a very quick way without having to do that at the protocol level,\u201d Santos says.\n\n\u201cAnd with that, you\u2019re not gonna have issues with this.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "While a complete resurgence of the 2021 bull market is improbable, the recent rebound of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) above $25,000 has spurred gains in other cryptocurrencies during the early months of 2023. This has presented an opportunity for crypto enthusiasts to accumulate positions in various top-performing cryptos before the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in the following year.\n\nAside from Bitcoin\u2019s performance, there are plenty of other catalysts for these top-performing cryptos investors should consider. Each has its unique models and supports real-world use cases that create value for their communities.\n\nI think these three top-performing cryptos are worth considering right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSymbol Cryptocurrency Price ARB-USD Arbitrum $1.17 SOL-USD Solana $0.27 FTM-USD Fantom $0.33\n\nArbitrum (ARB)\n\nBlue violet vector background. Bitcoin and blockchain. Electronic cryptocurrency and modern technology. Online banking, and financial communications. World wide web. Cryptos\n\nSource: Vit-Mar / Shutterstock.com\n\nFollowing a bearish start in May, Arbitrum (ARB-USD) has experienced a remarkable 13% surge over the past week. Analyzing the on-chain data reveals a notable presence of influential crypto whales, potentially influencing the optimistic price outlook for Arbitrum.\n\nDespite a significant 35% price drop in Arbitrum between April 14 and May 11, a noteworthy trend emerged as large investors holding between one million to 10 million ARB tokens actively purchased the dip. These influential whales nearly doubled their holdings within this timeframe, accumulating an additional 158 million ARB tokens. This chart demonstrates their increased stake, starting from a total balance of 222 million tokens on April 13 to 380 million as of May 16.\n\nApart from the notable bullish activity exhibited by the whales, the Arbitrum network has been experiencing widespread adoption among users. If the optimistic price prediction for Arbitrum materializes, ARB could potentially surge toward $1.35 before encountering any significant bearish pressure.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image. SOL-USD, Solana price predictions\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) has experienced a remarkable turnaround in 2023, defying the odds after a tumultuous 2022. With triple-digit returns, Solana\u2019s value has more than doubled, currently trading at $22.35, showcasing its strong performance this year.\n\nIn 2023, the developers of Solana have recognized the critical issue of blockchain instability and are committed to addressing it. Additionally, Solana has successfully gained a significant portion of the Web 3.0 market, particularly in the non-fungible token (NFT) sector, currently holding a 14% market volume share. With expectations of a market rebound, Solana\u2019s market share is poised to grow further as Ethereum\u2019s network congestion during rallies presents an opportunity for Solana to attract more users. As the go-to choice for developers transitioning away from Ethereum, Solana\u2019s popularity is expected to remain strong during the next market upswing.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolana currently trades at $21.02 with a 24-hour trading volume of $197 million. It has seen a slight 0.67% increase in value during the past 24 hours.\n\nIn other SOL news, Solana Labs has opened a 25,000 square feet community office space in Lower Manhattan. This collaborative hub will support Solana project participants and host Solana-related events. The cost of setting up the office remains undisclosed, emphasizing Solana Labs\u2019 commitment to fostering innovation and collaboration within the Solana community.\n\nFantom (FTM)\n\nThe Fantom (FTM) crypto logo on a black background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ARTEMENKO VALENTYN\n\nFantom (FTM-USD) is a sharding-based layer-1 protocol known for its fast and cost-effective transactions, making it a popular choice among developers and investors alike. With its scalability and user-friendly environment for dapps and smart contracts, Fantom stands out as a solid investment option.\n\nFantom has faced a significant downturn since April 19, 2023, with a 30% loss, dampening market sentiment. However, recent minor upward movements suggest a possible shift towards a bullish trend as buying pressure increases and bulls regain control over the price.\n\nFTM\u2019s recent bullish momentum has led to a notable price surge, with a 5.09% increase in the past 24 hours, pushing the token\u2019s value to $0.3885.\n\nFantom presents an attractive long-term investment opportunity driven by its dedicated development team, strategic partnerships, and the promising future it holds within the blockchain industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in SOL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post It\u2019s Not Too Late to Buy These 3 Top Performing Cryptos appeared first on InvestorPlace."
