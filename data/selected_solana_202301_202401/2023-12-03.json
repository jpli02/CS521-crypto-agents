        "content": "Solana DeFi Platform Jupiter Shares Airdrop Allocations \u2013 Here\u2019s How to Check Eligibility\n\nJupiter, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator running on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, has announced the opening of initial claims for its JUP token airdrop.\n\nIn a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), the project said users can now begin claiming their tokens.\n\nThe airdrop has been designed to distribute 40% of the total JUP token supply, which amounts to four out of the 10 billion tokens.\n\nThe distribution will occur in four phases, as outlined by the project in a November announcement.\n\nThe first phase will release one billion Jupiter tokens to users who have conducted a minimum of $1,000 in swap volume on the protocol by the snapshot date of November 2.\n\nMeow, the pseudonymous founder of the project, shared details about the allocation process on X.\n\nIn the first phase, 2% of the tokens will be distributed to all wallets, while 7% will be allocated through a \u201ctiered score based distribution\u201d that considers adjusted volume.\n\nAn additional 1% will be allotted to community members on platforms like Discord and Twitter, as well as developers.\n\nMeow expressed the belief that this breakdown would reward power users and contributors more significantly, while also providing an incentive for others to engage with the platform.\n\nAccording to the founder, Jupiter has facilitated a cumulative trading volume of $35 billion as of October, with 80% of that volume being generated by only 0.2% of all wallets.\n\nSome Users Are Not Satisfied With the Airdrop\n\n\n\nHowever, some individuals have expressed dissatisfaction with their allocation, claiming that they should have received a larger share based on factors such as the age of their wallets and their level of engagement with the protocol over the years.\n\n\u201cThe same wallet used Jup in 2021 more than 40x, 2022 more than 20x and used well enough in 2023,\u201d one Twitter user said.\n\nTo determine eligibility for the airdrop and check their allocations, users are advised to follow the instructions provided by the Jupiter project."

        "content": "Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) his disapproval of the popular description of the Solana network as an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d In his words, he doesn\u2019t \u201csee a future where Solana thrives and somehow ETH dies.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs. It\u2019s lame. Pareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies. I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly ???????? (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nSolana Lauded as an ETH Killer\n\nThe layer-1 Solana network was created to offer smart contract capabilities like the Ethereum network. However, it supersedes the Ethereum mainnet regarding speed and energy efficiency thanks to its use of a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum blockchain implemented the energy-consuming proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The network also processed only about 30 transactions per second, compared to Solana\u2019s record of 50,000 to 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nDue to its inherent features, the Solana network has been lauded as an ETH killer since its official launch in 2020. The term has also been used to describe some popular blockchains such as Cardano, Tezos, Avalanche, and Polygon.\n\nSolana has also introduced toolsets to onboard developers from the Ethereum network into its ecosystem. In July, Solana Labs launched Solang, a compiler enabling developers familiar with Ethereum\u2019s programming language (Solidity) to write smart contracts on the Solana mainnet.\n\nDescribing the expression as \u201clame,\u201d Yakovenko argued that even though Solana and Ethereum have similarities, the latter will not be overshadowed by the initial.\n\nSolana Ranks Among Best Performing Cryptocurrencies\n\nAmong the top 10 cryptocurrencies, Solana\u2019s SOL emerged as the best performer. Maintaining its ranking as the sixth-largest crypto by market capitalization, SOL has soared by over 220% in the last three months alone. These metrics supersede crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).\n\nGoing from as low as $17.9 to as high as $65.2, market experts suggest that the cryptocurrency will likely surpass the $70 price mark as active addresses increase. Presently, SOL trades at $63.8, representing 2.7% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinStats"

        "title": "Solana could 3x in December, Galaxy Fox 10x after presale - crypto.news",
        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nOne of the top performers in the October and November cryptocurrency rally was Solana (SOL). The altcoin outperformed the rest of the market with a 200% price increase.\n\nThe price increase might continue into December. Predicted to conclude the year with a threefold price increase, SOL is among the best altcoins to buy.\n\nAnother altcoin that has built bullish momentum is Galaxy Fox (GFOX). The uniqueness of the project has earned it massive support from the crypto community. But can $GFOX experience a 10x price jump after its crypto presale? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nFrom October to November, the price of Solana jumped from $21 to as high as $68. Although the rally cooled off in mid-November, with the SOL token dropping back to $60, the altcoin has shown the potential for more gains.\n\nYou might also like: Emerging crypto attracting Solana enthusiasts\n\nThe upside potential of Solana has been attributed to several factors. First, the network has grown at a tremendous pace, challenging Ethereum. The cost of operating on the network is also significantly cheaper than other blockchains, making it one of the best altcoins to buy.\n\nThe defi network of Solana has also recorded a significant jump in interest. Several projects, including BONK, ranked as one of the best meme coins to buy now. They also recorded major gains, aiding the growth of Solana. Lastly, many analysts have stated that the price of SOL is underpriced.\n\nThese predictions have hinted at massive growth in the Solana price. Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal has called Solana one of the best altcoins to invest in, projecting a price of $400. Jacob Canfield projected a price of $1,000 by early 2024. This makes a 3x price jump to $180 seemingly possible in December.\n\nWill Galaxy Fox surge up to 10x?\n\nAnother altcoin that has attracted massive bullish attention in recent weeks is Galaxy Fox. The project has been praised as one of the best ICOs because of its uniqueness. Galaxy Fox has seamlessly merged two industries in the crypto space \u2014 meme coins and play-to-earn (P2E) gaming.\n\nAs an innovative project, Galaxy Fox has been positioned to lead a new sector \u2014 meme coins with massive utility. An immersive web3 endless runner game serves as the foundation for the Galaxy Fox ecosystem.\n\nWithin this virtual world, players will select and build unique fox characters with a mission to dominate the galaxy. Players will face off against one another for the top spots on the intergalactic leaderboard as they cement their legacies in the virtual world.\n\nThe leaderboard will also be used to reward gamers. The higher they are ranked after every competition, the greater their rewards will be. The rewards would be in digital assets and the ERC 20 coin of the Galaxy Fox ecosystem.\n\nGalaxy Fox is also used for staking and performing governance activity within the network. This has been added to allow investors to earn passive income. The project has gained massive support already and raised over $450,000 in just a few weeks.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nWhile Solana is primed for massive gains, it could well be outperformed by Galaxy Fox. This is because projects at the forefront of innovation in the crypto space have always recorded massive growth.\n\nThis is why GFOX is being featured among the best altcoins to buy. As such, analysts have projected massive growth for Galaxy Fox, reaching up to 10x after the presale of the project is completed.\n\nRanked as one of the best cryptocurrency investments, now is the best time to acquire GFOX now, it trades at $0.0.0008778. So make sure to check out their presale today.\n\nLearn more about Galaxy Fox (GFOX) on its website, telegram and X."

These two assets also have the most regulatory acceptance globally.But for those willing to take bigger risks, the search for the next champion is already on. The recent price rally of Solana (SOL), Maker (MKR), and Chainlink (LINK), was a stark reminder.

The key themes these investors are looking for are faster and more scalable Layer-1 chains, real-world tokenization, and convergence of traditional and decentralized finance. These trends are not isolated phenomena; they are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, driving innovation.The quest for scalability has become a central focus in blockchain development. Layer-1 chains, the underlying infrastructure of blockchain networks, often face limitations in handling high transaction volumes without compromising speed, decentralization, or security. This is particularly challenging for applications that require real-time transactions or a large number of concurrent users.In 2024, we can expect to see even faster and more efficient layer-1 solutions emerge, addressing the scalability challenges that have hindered wider adoption. Networks like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and recently launched Move programming language-based chains like Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) are already making significant strides in this area, utilizing innovative consensus mechanisms and sharding techniques to achieve high transaction throughput while maintaining decentralization.Such advancements will pave the way for a new generation of blockchain applications that require high scalability, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocols, and Web3-powered gaming platforms.\u2014the process of converting real-world assets into digital tokens\u2014is gaining momentum. By tokenizing traditional assets, such as real estate, commodities, financial assets or even intellectual property, we can create fractional ownership, enhance liquidity, and democratize access to these asset classes.Soon, we can expect to see further advancements in tokenization protocols and the emergence of tokenized assets across various industries. This will enable individuals to invest in a wider range of assets with smaller amounts of capital, while also providing institutional investors with new opportunities for diversification. Progress on this front is already underway, as seen in recent real-world examples such as investment firm KKR\u2019s tokenized fund, PolyTrade\u2019s tokenized trade invoices, and the growing number of tokenized US Treasuries.For reference, the real-world assets (RWA) portfolio of MakerDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization that develops and maintains the Dai stablecoin, is now more than $3 billion. The community governing MakerDAO has paved the way to purchase up to an additional $1.28 billion in U.S. government bonds via crypto asset manager BlockTower Capital.Traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) are increasingly converging, as institutions seek to gain exposure to the crypto ecosystem while leveraging their existing infrastructure. DeFi protocols offer innovative financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, but they often lack the liquidity and institutional backing that TradFi institutions require.In the coming months, we can expect to see more bridges and gateways connecting TradFi and DeFi, enabling seamless transactions and the creation of new hybrid financial products. This integration will facilitate the flow of capital between the two worlds and help to legitimize the crypto space. Some of the networks enabling this include Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and MakerDAO (DAI).Consider Chainlink, for example. A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink bridges real-world data and smart contracts on blockchains. It has built a network of node operators who access external data feeds and relay them to smart contracts. In fact, Chainlink's recently launched Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) aims to become the \"TCP/IP of finance\" and connect various blockchains. The network has partnered with traditional finance giants like SWIFT, BNY Mellon, Citigroup, BNP Paribas, and ANZ\u2014an Australian bank that recently completed a successful transaction using Chainlink's CCIP.We can expect to see a new wave of innovation in the financial sector.The crypto market cycle is entering a new phase. To capture outsized alpha, investors thus need to focus on trends rather than individual tokens. Think of DeFi summer of 2020 or the NFT Mania in 2021, where both these themes led to a broad-based rally in token prices associated with them. Themes such as Layer-1 chains, real-world tokenization, and convergence of traditional and decentralized finance should thus be on the radar of market participants, and so should trends such as SocialFi and Web3 Gaming.(The author, Parth Chaturvedi , is Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
