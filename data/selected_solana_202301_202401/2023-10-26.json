        "content": "A recently released report explores the future potential of blockchain technology, particularly focusing on the revival and growing influence of Solana (SOL) in the crypto market.\n\nAsset and mutual fund manager VanEck disclosed one key driver of Solana\u2019s influence is its advancements in Smart Contract Platforms (SCPs), defined as systems that execute contracts on a blockchain without requiring third-party involvement.\n\nAlthough other SCP-compatible blockchains exist, such as BNB Chain and Ethereum (ETH), Solana has notably dominated this sector. VanEck\u2019s analysis suggests that this sector, particularly SCPs, is poised for significant adoption in the future, positioning Solana as a prominent player in the blockchain industry.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Braces For $50 Billion Influx Following ETF Launch, Bitwise CEO Says 6 months ago\n\nSolana\u2019s Dominance In Smart Contract Platforms\n\nSolana\u2019s emergence as a dominant force in the SCP realm is reinforced by its high throughput and scalability, surpassing many existing blockchain networks. Its ability to process a high volume of transactions quickly and at a lower cost compared to some competitors has been a pivotal factor driving its influence and potential for widespread adoption.\n\nTotal crypto market cap currently at $1.24 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s ecosystem has seen a surge in decentralized applications (dApps) and projects leveraging its infrastructure, further solidifying its position as an attractive and viable platform for developers and users alike. This growing adoption and technical superiority hint at a promising trajectory for Solana, suggesting it may remain a key player in the expanding landscape of blockchain technology.\n\nThe VanEck report underscored the undeniable dominance of Solana in the SCP sector. But despite these existing alternatives, none have managed to rival Solana\u2019s current supremacy within the field. VanEck further highlighted the sector\u2019s imminent surge in adoption, foreseeing a promising growth trajectory by 2030.\n\nSource: VanEck\n\nHowever, the report also emphasized the necessity of a groundbreaking application for exponential expansion. According to VanEck, among the contenders, Solana stands as the most fitting platform with the potential to fill this pivotal role, positioning itself as the likely candidate to lead the sector\u2019s transformative growth.\n\nVanEck observed that the blockchain hosting the groundbreaking application could experience substantial benefits from the app\u2019s generated activity. The analysis presents a scenario where Solana becomes the pioneering blockchain to support a single application that brings on board over 100 million users.\n\nOver the past week L1s have started to see a shift in sentiment.$SOL activity for the month has translated to sharp increased in DEX volume activity as TVL and users have seen an uptick.

In an October 26 post on X (formerly Twitter), Artemis expressed being impressed by Solana\u2019s performance, citing key metrics such as Total Value Locked (TVL), decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, active addresses, and transactions.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nNotably, Artemis emphasized its expectations for the network\u2019s future improvement, especially with its 100% uptime since March 2023. The collective positive sentiments from both Artemis and the asset management firm shed light on Solana\u2019s recovery and significant potential, as detailed in their respective analyses.\n\nAt the time of writing, Solana (SOL) was trading at $32.83, up 3.5% in the last 24 hours and registered a decent 7.8% increase in the last seven days, according to figures by Coingecko.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "Solana is witnessing a constant upward price movement in the cryptocurrency market in Q4, 2023. As of December 26, 2023, the Solana price is trading at $115, recording monthly gains of 100% and weekly gains of 53%. Solana crossed the $100 mark after almost 20 months since April 2022.\n\nLet us discuss the market performance and price history of Solana along with the reasons behind Solana\u2019s ongoing price surge.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFactors Propelling Solana\u2019s Rise\n\nSolana price is up as a result of the rising SPL token airdrops and listing on exchanges, increased DeFi and NFT activity on the Solana network, and increasing trading volume.\n\nSPL Token Airdrops\n\nSolana has always been a viable blockchain network with high transaction processing for DeFi development. Jito is one of the DeFi projects on Solana that launched its highly anticipated JTO token airdrop. Adding to that, Coinbase announced the listing of JTO tokens on December 6, 2023.\n\nSolana price increased by 15% and was trading over $72 on December 8, 2023 as a result of the Jito DeFi project airdrop and listing on crypto exchange platforms. The JTO token was launched at a starting price of $6.01 and distributed around $225 million worth of JTO tokens in its recent airdrop. Even though the JTO price is currently trading at $2.82, it brought a huge attention to the Solana and led to its price surge.\n\nPotential Solana ecosystem airdrops that you can still qualify for: MarginFi \u2013 Borrowing/lending (active points system)\n\nTensor \u2013 NFT exchange (active points system)\n\nDrift \u2013 perp dex\n\nKamino \u2013 Borrowing/lending (upcoming points system)\n\nParcl \u2013 Real estate speculation (upcoming\u2026 \u2014 Patrick Scott | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) December 8, 2023\n\nSolana proponents are expecting a few more airdrops of the SPL tokens airdrops of Solana DeFi projects, following the success of JTO airdrop. Analyst Patrick Scott posted on X, listing the upcoming Solana token airdrops for those who missed the JTO airdrop. The anticipation of these upcoming airdrops is a primary reason behind Solana\u2019s price rise.\n\nRising NFT Sales Volume\n\nSolana\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales volume has surpassed the NFT sales volume of Ethereum on June 30, 2023. According to CryptoSlam, Solana is currently at the third position in terms of 30-day NFT sales volume after the two top blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nNFT sales worth $162 million took place on the Solana Network, which is up by 350% in the last 30 days. Coming to the number of NFT transactions, Solana ranks above Bitcoin and Ethereum with more than 2 million transactions. This incredible rise in NFT trading activity adds to the ongoing price rally of Solana.\n\nTech Upgrades\n\nAfter facing network outages several times previously, Solana\u2019s reputation of being the fastest blockchain crumbled. However, the technical upgrades of the network are strengthening the blockchain. The Solana network performance improved significantly in H1, 2023 with 100% uptime.\n\nSolana\u2019s developers keep bringing tech upgrades to make the coin even more perfect for several use cases. It has added optional zero-knowledge-compatible encryption that will make the transactions even more secure. Furthermore, Solana will help extend Render Network into new applications, such as machine learning and inference training.\n\nSolana supports several innovative blockchain applications including NFTs, Web3 gaming, DeFi projects, and other decentralized applications. The fundamental technical strength of Solana is an add on feature to its ultra-speed transaction processing at low fees. In addition, Solana is one of the first blockchain to launch a Web3 smartphone in April 2023.\n\nSolana price surged by 5% on December 6, 2023 when its founder Anatoly Yakovenko talked about the upcoming launch of new Web3 smartphone models with more applications.\n\nSol Prediction : What\u2019s Next For Solana Price?\n\nConsidering the recent price breakout of Solana, popular crypto analysts like Ali Martinez estimated a continuous price rise in the upcoming weeks. Ali posted on X stating that the price breakout above $68 can propel Solana\u2019s price to $90. However, if the price drops below the $60 support, it could fall back to $47.\n\nOn another note, global investment manager VanEck estimated over 10,000% Solana price rally by 2030. The Solana price is already on the uptrend as the year comes to end, showing the possibility of VanEck\u2019s estimation!"
