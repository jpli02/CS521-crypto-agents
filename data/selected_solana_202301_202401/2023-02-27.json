        "title": "Here's why the recent Solana outage took almost a day to resolve - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Twitter user @DBCrypt0 explained why Solana was down for almost 20 hours over the weekend.\n\nSolana\u2019s uptime status showed the network suffered an outage that lasted 18 hours and 50 minutes on Feb. 25 \u2014 the first interruption in 2023.\n\nSolana has a history of network outages, having endured 11 major, and 3 minor, outages in 2022. The downtime outages ranged between 1 hour 15 minutes and 17 hours 7 minutes during this period. The most recent outage was the longest in over a year.\n\n@DBCrypt0 said outages occur due to \u201ca massive design flaw\u201d that bogs the system down. He also explained that validator communications shift to Discord during an outage, contributing to potentially long downtimes.\n\nSolana\u2019s design flaw\n\nSolana adopts an on-chain consensus model, meaning network transactions consist of consensus communication between validators and the transactions themselves \u2014 such as token transfers and minting. This inflates the transaction volume, said @DBCrypt0.\n\nThe chart below shows a snapshot of the network\u2019s transactions. The pink portion of the bar represents actual transactions, while the light blue refers to the validator verification communications. @DBCrypt0 commented that it was \u201ccrazy\u201d validator messages make up 90%-95% of transactions.\n\n\u201cSo when #Solana mentions they are doing 4K TPS just know less than 10% are ACTUAL transactions on the network.\u201d\n\nAs the majority of transaction volume is made up of validators\u2019 messages, this \u201cbog[s] down the system.\u201d And when the network goes down, validators cannot speak to one another, said @DBCrypt0.\n\n\n\nIn such instances, validators turn to Discord to decide what to do. The problem is that two-thirds of validators must consent to any proposed action before it can happen, and some may be offline and unaware of an outage.\n\n\u201cThey then need 66% of validators I believe to agree on a solution to get back up.\u201d\n\nHedera called out\n\nSolana \u201ccreates insane amounts of data for full nodes\u201d by operating an on-chain consensus model, @DBCrypt0 said.\n\nHe added that by bloating the history with unnecessary validator messages, \u201ca data center\u201d is required to operate a full Solana node.\n\nIn rounding off, @DBCrypt0 pointed out that Hedera also runs an on-chain consensus model and suffers from the same inherent bloat flaw as Solana.\n\n\u201cSorry to break it to all the #HBARbarians but the majority of tx are unnecessary Just as they are on #Solana $HBAR only does around 3-5 TPS on average.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 25, SOL suffered a 9% swing to the downside but recovered by closing the next daily candle above the previous day\u2019s opening price \u2014 indicating the market accepting Solana outages as expected behavior.\n\nA Hedera representative contacted CryptoSlate post publication to clarify that the network does not operate an on-chain consensus mechanism. Instead, the Hedera Consensus Service \"creates decentralized, auditable logs of immutable and timestamped events\" to track and log data."

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eclipse is launching with Polygon, the leading Ethereum scaling protocol, to launch Polygon SVM, the first Solana-equivalent scaling solution. Polygon SVM is a Layer 2 blockchain capable of running all smart contracts and tooling compatible with Solana.\n\nEclipse, a Polygon Ventures portfolio company and recipient of a Solana Foundation grant, will deploy the Sealevel virtual machine (SVM) Layer 2 blockchain for Polygon SVM. With the launch, dApps built for the Solana blockchain can now easily migrate or go multichain to Polygon SVM, providing users with a faster and more efficient experience.\n\nNew Use Cases and Higher Volume for Polygon Transactions\n\nThe Solana-equivalent Polygon SVM will offer superior speed for developers building games or high throughput DeFi applications such as central limit order books, enabling new use cases and traffic for the Polygon ecosystem.\n\n\"We are thrilled to see Eclipse launch Polygon SVM on the Polygon Network, which will provide developers with a powerful new blockchain infrastructure,\" Urvit Goel, VP of Games and Platform at Polygon Labs. \"Our vision has always been to see development of novel modular blockchain architectures, and Polygon SVM is the latest addition to the ecosystem of cutting-edge scaling solutions.\"\n\nBenefits of the Polygon SVM\n\nDevelopers can now choose the SVM on Polygon\n\nLeverages the security of the existing Polygon network while running the new blockchain\n\nFaster and more efficient experience\n\nEclipse is a customizable Layer 2 (rollup) provider that allows blockchain infrastructure developers to choose between different virtual machines, including the Sealevel virtual machine. Its rollup technology enables developers to run a new blockchain while leveraging the security of existing networks such as Polygon.\n\n\"We're excited to build on Polygon and develop superior scaling solutions,\" said Neel Somani, CEO of Eclipse. \"Polygon SVM is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between the Polygon and Solana communities.\"\n\nPolygon Labs previously acquired the Hermez Network (now Polygon Hermez) to develop the first EVM-equivalent zero-knowledge rollup. Polygon Labs later acquired the Ethereum scaling startup Mir. Polygon Avail, a blockchain that is focused on data availability (ordering and recording blockchain transactions), will provide security for Polygon's Eclipse chain.\n\nLast year, Eclipse announced its $15 million fundraise led by Polychain and Tribe Capital. Since then, the Eclipse team has developed a zero-knowledge Sealevel virtual machine proof-of-concept. The Eclipse developer documentation describes the customizations that it supports. Over 100 projects have expressed interest in deploying to Eclipse chains.\n\nThe testnet for Polygon SVM is slated for release in late Q1 2023, with the mainnet launch to follow in the summer.\n\nNotes to the Editor\n\nLayer 2 refers to blockchains built on top of a base blockchain layer which is known as Layer 1. Virtual machines such as the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) or Sealevel virtual machine (SVM) execute smart contracts. Modular blockchains share infrastructure with other blockchains to perform one of their critical functions for operation. Zero-knowledge proofs or zk-rollups use advanced cryptography, and this cryptography validates that computation is done in the correct way following certain rules.\n\nAbout Polygon Labs\n\nPolygon Labs develops Ethereum scaling solutions for Polygon protocols. Polygon Labs engages with other ecosystem developers to help make available scalable, affordable, secure and sustainable blockchain infrastructure for Web3. Polygon Labs has initially developed a growing suite of protocols for developers to gain easy access to major scaling solutions, including layer 2s (zero-knowledge rollups and optimistic rollups), sidechains, hybrid chains, app-specific chains, enterprise chains, and data availability protocols. Scaling solutions that Polygon Labs initially developed have seen widespread adoption with tens of thousands of decentralized apps, unique addresses exceeding 218 million, over 1.15 million smart contracts created and 2.42 billion total transactions processed since inception. The existing Polygon network is home for some of the biggest Web3 projects, such as Aave, Uniswap, and OpenSea, and well-known enterprises, including Robinhood, Stripe and Adobe. Polygon Labs is carbon neutral with the goal of leading Web3 in becoming carbon negative.\n\nIf you're an Ethereum Developer, you're already a Polygon developer! Leverage Polygon\u2019s fast and secure txns for dApps you develop, get started here.\n\nAbout Eclipse\n\nEclipse, a customizable rollup provider based in San Francisco, CA was founded in 2022 by Neel Somani. Designed for developers building some of blockchain's most unique use cases, Eclipse challenges the current constraints and limitations presented by existing blockchain technologies. Featuring a novel architecture that allows for decentralized applications to act as their own sovereign chain, Eclipse enables developers to deploy customizable chains without the hassle of managing infrastructure and security. Developers who are interested in Eclipse's technology can sign up for the mailing list on Eclipse's website and follow Eclipse's Twitter."
