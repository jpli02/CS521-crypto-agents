        "content": "BTC price showed a negative price action during the first two days of the week. The cryptocurrency failed to break above $27,700. On Wednesday, BTC dropped below $27,000 before the bulls pushed it back above the key level. This resulted in a decreased investor interest in the altcoins as the markets experience a low trading volume. At the time of writing, the SOL price stood at $22.01, after a slight recovery from weekly lows of $21.50."

        "content": "Sign up to our Substack, follow us on Twitter and connect with us on LinkedIn.\n\nBrowser-based 2D space economic sim Sage Labs from ATMTA\u2019s Star Atlas team, has seen a big leap in transaction volume since its launch at the end of September.\n\nBreaking it down, data suggests overall transactions have more than doubled in less than a week, from 1 million on 4th October to over 2 million as of 10th October. The game has exceeded 16 million transactions in total, and accounts for 15% of all transactions on Solana, up from 3% in the previous week.\n\nSage Labs is part of the bigger ecosystem of space MMO Star Atlas, and runs fully onchain. To some extent this is why its onchain transaction volume is higher than most other blockchain games, which only have certain aspects of the game deployed onchain.\n\nStill, the game had 6,000 player profiles created in its first week, which is currently up to almost 9,000, and has over 1,500 daily active users, not accounting for bots.\n\nDespite being forced to restructure and size down the company due to economic turmoil earlier in 2023, ATMTA CEO Michael Wagner has never hinted of scaling down his vision for Star Atlas. In a recent interview Wagner said that \u201cIf anything, we\u2019ve probably broadened the scope of what\u2019s possible as we explore the tech and actually deploy and deliver on various features and products.\u201d\n\nAs part of delivering on that broader scope, ATMTA recently unlocked access to its open-platform developer tools for creators both within the Solana network, and beyond. With these tools Star Atlas aims to open up the development and asset composability to a wider set of parties, while adding utility to its own ecosystem.\n\nStay up-to-date at the Star Atlas website."

        "content": "A new update to Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) has enabled confidential transfers for the project\u2019s token standard.\n\nSolana\u2019s network of validators was able to reach a supermajority, approving the adoption of Solana\u2019s v1.16 update after nearly 10 months of development and testing.\n\nThe update includes the rollout of confidential transfers for SPL tokens, the token standard for Solana network tokens (like ERC-20 tokens for Ethereum), according to a recent press release from Helius, a Solana developer platform.\n\nConfidential transfers will use zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to encrypt the balances and transaction amounts of SPL tokens.\n\nExplains Helius,\n\n\u201cThe primary focus of this feature is to improve user privacy through a renowned emphasis on confidentiality rather than anonymity.\n\nConfidential transfers leverage Twisted ElGamal Encryption for mathematical operations on the encrypted amounts. These transfers are validated using Sigma Protocols, a specialized category of zero-knowledge proofs where one party (the prover) can demonstrate to another party (the verifier) that they know of a certain secret without actually disclosing the secret itself.\u201d\n\nSolana\u2019s native token, SOL, is trading at $22.19 at time of writing. The eighth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 6% in the past 24 hours and more than 4% in the past seven days.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Crypto news for Solana and Polygon - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "On Sunday, a very strange thing happened in the crypto world. In fact, the SAGE Labs game by the Star Atlas team, based on Solana, single-handedly surpassed the entire activity of the entire Polygon network.\n\nSpecifically, SAGE Labs activity accounted for 15% of all activity on Solana.\n\nSolana and Polygon: news from the crypto world\n\nSolana and Polygon are two distinct networks.\n\nThe former is a first-layer independent blockchain with its own native cryptocurrency (SOL).\n\nPolygon, on the other hand, is a second layer of Ethereum, i.e. a service that provides additional functionality to Ethereum\u2019s first-layer network, in particular faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nIn theory, the two networks should not be compared, but in this specific case the comparison serves to give an order of magnitude to the boom of SAGE Labs.\n\nAccording to polygonscan.com, around 2 million transactions were recorded on Polygon\u2019s blockchain on Sunday.\n\nIn contrast, more than 360 million transactions were recorded on Solana\u2019s blockchain on the same day, according to data from solscan.\n\nSAGE Labs\u2019 boom\n\nIn an amazing sequence of events, the browser-based game alone recorded over 2.29 million transactions on Sunday 8 October 2023.\n\nSAGE Labs alone managed to outperform the entire Polygon network in a single day. But then things stabilised.\n\nSince its launch about a month ago, SAGE Labs has already recorded over 16 million transactions, not least because it is a completely on-chain game. In fact, it requires its players to authenticate almost every in-game action with their Solana wallet, generating a small fee for each verification.\n\nAlthough the number of active players per hour is not large (less than 1,000), they generate an average of about 150 transactions per hour each, which adds up to millions over the course of a day.\n\nOn 8 October, the total of 1,442 players generated 2,293,210 transactions, compared to 2,037,330 for the entire Polygon network, or an average of 1,590 transactions per player.\n\nTransactions generated by SAGE Labs on 8 October also accounted for approximately 15 percent of all transactions recorded on the Solana blockchain.\n\nSAGE Labs offers players a simulation of managing a 2D space, with simulated resource management and data analysis.\n\nStar Atlas\n\nThe game was developed by Star Atlas, which is opening up its toolkit to developers.\n\nIn fact, the creator of Star Atlas, ATMTA, is granting developers access to its toolkit on the Solana blockchain, and this initiative started with the SAGE Labs game. The toolkit provides developers with a comprehensive hub of links, documentation and free access to a wealth of resources, Unreal Engine tools, APIs and more.\n\nAccording to a Star Atlas representative, SAGE Labs is a unique, very special game because it works entirely on chain. It also requires players to have a Solana-compatible wallet and SOL or ATLAS tokens to fully participate in the game.\n\nHowever, while SAGE Labs is enjoying success, Star Atlas faced financial difficulties earlier this year and laid off up to 73 per cent of its staff in July. According to company CEO Michael Wagner, the layoffs were necessary to adapt to market dynamics and ensure the future of Star Atlas is sustainable."
