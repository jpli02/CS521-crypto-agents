        "content": "The dramatically popular debut of Pepe coin this year has put frog meme cryptos in the spotlight. While the new Ethereum ERC-20 token launched on April 15th, Pepe coin went parabolic starting May 1st, and that would soon blow out sales of Pepe (SOL) as well.\n\nThe price madness was a bullish portent for Ethereum and DeFi crypto blockchains.\n\nMoreover, it was so popular on crypto exchanges that supporters compared it to DOGE and SHIB. That was during the beginning of May amidst the flash rally.\n\nPepe Coin Surge Shifts Attention Elsewhere\n\nAfter the Pepe coin price settled from its all-time high, it got legs and rallied again Friday, May 12th. As a result, markets have more evidence that PEPE is a project with long-term horizons, not a rug pull. That might be giving confidence crypto investors taking another look at Pepe (SOL).\n\nBut Pepe Coin isn\u2019t the only one out there. Before it, there was PepeSol. Additionally, it\u2019s not the only frog meme coin, either.\n\nJust as a group of geese is a flock and a group of bees is a swarm, a group of frogs is called an army. Well, there\u2019s a small army of frog meme coins out there on the blockchains.\n\nHere are just a couple examples of frog cryptos that are getting a bump out of Pepe coin\u2019s rise:\n\nPepe (SOL) Blew up on Pepe Coin (ERC-20)\u2019s Coattails.\n\nPepeSol (also listed as PEPE token) is a meme coin on Solana. The fast and low-fee smart contract blockchain has seen significant growth recently.\n\nWhile it was launched earlier this year in February, Pepe SOL didn\u2019t get to hopping the way Pepe Coin did a couple of months later.\n\nWhen Pepe Coin went viral in crypto markets, however, Pepe (SOL) jumped from $0.000078 on Apr 29th to $0.00153 on May 2nd. That was a 1,860% increase in its price in three days.\n\nCrypto investors holding Pepe Sol only had until May 3 to sell at that massive ROI for the flash rally. It crashed to around $0.00023 by May 7th.\n\nThere\u2019s also a Pepe coin on Arbitrum, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum."

At the same time, it has accumulated losses of 13.90% across the past month, as the latest charts indicate.\n\nSolana 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nDespite the CoinMarketCap community\u2019s optimism, the one-day technical analysis (TA) gauges from the finance and crypto tracking website TradingView paint a slightly more bearish view of Solana. Indeed, the summary of the gauges suggests a \u2018sell\u2019 at 14, which is the result of oscillators in the \u2018neutral\u2019 zone at 9, and moving averages (MA) looking at a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 13, as the most recent data shows.\n\nSolana 1-day sentiment gauges.

But we\u2019ll see what happens, right? I think that\u2019s one of the pieces that could cause a massive boom in crypto adoption.\u201d\n\nYakovenko also says that he agrees with the unpopular sentiment that stablecoins are the \u201ckiller app\u201d that will likely attract users around the globe, especially those who reside in countries with collapsing currencies as they have a serious need to access digital dollars.\n\nLast month, the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services published a draft stablecoin bill that proposes qualifications and requirements to be a payment stablecoin issuer and details the criminal penalties for violators.\n\nThe bill would also request the research and exploration of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "7 Cryptos With 1,000% Upside Potential - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptos are one of the most volatile and unpredictable asset classes in the world. They can soar to new heights or crash to new lows in a matter of days or even hours. But for some investors, that\u2019s exactly what makes them so attractive. The potential for massive gains in a short period of time is hard to resist, especially when you see stories of people who turned a few thousand dollars into millions by investing in the right coins at the right time.\n\nBut chasing such high upside potential is not without risks. Cryptos are subject to rampant scamming, rug pulls and false promises about the underlying technology, all of which can cause you to lose most of your investments.\n\nThat being said, I believe that there are some cryptocurrencies that have the potential to deliver 1000% returns or more in the next few years. With the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cuts and the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving next year, I believe many promising projects are well-positioned to rise more than 1000% in a two-year timeframe.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere they are:\n\nRender Token (RNDR)\n\nVarious cryptocurrency coins. Cryptos. Cryptocurrencies representing 3AC Crypto., ARBK Stock. cheap cryptos to buy on the rebound\n\nSource: Wit Olszewski / Shutterstock\n\nAlthough it\u2019s a relatively big project compared to the other ones here, I believe a 1000% gain for Render Token (RNDR-USD) is certainly within the realm of possibility. If you aren\u2019t familiar with the project, it is similar to Filecoin (FIL-USD), but with GPU computing power. It rents GPU power from thousands of users worldwide in exchange for the token and resells it at bulk through the blockchain.\n\nI previously suggested buying this token in late March at the $1.7 range before changing that suggestion to a sell at the $2.4 range (where it peaked). However, it\u2019s back trading near $1.95 and I believe now is a good time to start buying again.\n\nOf course, the broader market dictates the price action of almost every project that has a substantial trading volume. Thus, I\u2019d be prepared for more short-term losses if BTC slides more.\n\nAleph Zero (AZERO)\n\nAn aerial shot of a group of popular cryptocurrency tokens; cryptos\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAleph Zero (AZERO-USD) could very well be the next Solana (SOL-USD) if the market rallies again. It has all the necessary ingredients to drive up buzz.\n\nThe peer-reviewed blockchain claims to process over 100,000 transactions per second with near-instant finality. But what makes it better than many of the better-known Ethereum (ETH-USD) \u201ckillers\u201d is that it supports private smart contracts, IPFS cloud storage, substrate integration and an Oracle bridge to import real-world information.\n\nBut again, even though it\u2019s peer-reviewed, I would caution that blockchains with excessive TPS counts often have low decentralization. Indeed, it only has 121 validators, which means it\u2019s not nearly as decentralized as Ethereum or Solana.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless, if you\u2019re more worried about the upside than decentralization, AZERO is a worthy investment.\n\nTABOO Token (TABOO)\n\nWooden blocks display the word \"taboo\".\n\nSource: BabLab / Shutterstock.com\n\nTABOO (TABOO-USD) piqued my interest as it raised $10 million in funding last week, led by a private family office headed by a former JP Morgan senior executive. This deal values TABOO at $250 million, and the token has been up substantially so far this year.\n\nTABOO is not just a content creation platform. It\u2019s also a marketplace where users can buy and sell exclusive, high-quality NFTs and merchandise.\n\nAt the time of writing, TABOO token is trading at $0.0032 with a market cap of $30.9 million, That\u2019s far below the $250 million valuation. Thus, I believe that there is still a lot of room for growth for this project, especially when NFTs start being hot again.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV)\n\nCryptocurrency: Pile of cryptos and altcoins represented as physical coins\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in more upside potential, getting into pre-sales and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is a great way to gain exposure to up-and-coming projects. Tradecurve (TCRV-USD) is one such project that caught my eye. It is currently at the second stage of its ICO, as of writing, with each token going for $0.012. The launch price of the token is $0.088, so it\u2019s definitely a lucrative play right now.\n\nIt\u2019s a new hybrid exchange that lets users make accounts with just an email address and essentially get all the features on bigger platforms. With regulators getting tougher on KYC requirements, I believe there will likely be an outflow of users from bigger exchanges into smaller ones like Tradecurve. Thus, the risk here is worth it, in my opinion, considering the upside potential at launch.\n\nr/Cryptocurrency Moons (MOON)\n\nReddit Layoffs. Phone showing Reddit logo on screen in front of blurred background with reddit logo. Reddit IPO.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock\n\nr/Cryptocurrency Moons (MOON-USD) are the community tokens of the main cryptocurrency subreddit. Reddit is arguably the biggest platform through which retail crypto investors communicate and share their thoughts on various cryptos. Thus, MOON is among the most well-known cryptocurrencies despite its small market capitalization.\n\nThe current market cap is very small compared to the potential and influence of the r/Cryptocurrency subreddit. But one of the main catalysts that could boost the value of MOON in the near future is the listing on major exchanges. Many exchanges and their staff are active on the subreddit, and the community could persuade them to support the token during the next crypto bull market. This would increase the liquidity and exposure of MOON and will likely boost the market cap by a significant margin.\n\nIt is still a speculative and risky investment. But I believe it will offer significant returns either once the crypto market recovers or once Reddit goes public.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana Coin (SOL-USD) in front of the Solana logo. Solana price predictions.\n\nSource: Rcc_Btn / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana is currently the most popular alternative blockchain to Ethereum. It has blistering TPS counts, but as I\u2019ve previously noted, blockchains that boast high TPS are less decentralized. Likewise, Solana suffers stability issues and has frequent \u201coutages,\u201d something that is unheard of in every other blockchain ecosystem. That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve mostly been bearish on Solana throughout 2022, but now may be the time to change the sentiment.\n\nWhy? I believe it is currently trading at a very compelling range considering the success it has had so far in capturing Ethereum\u2019s Web 3.0 market share. Moreover, the developers have finally acknowledged that they will be working on its stability issues, making it the main focus in 2023. Thus, a buy at the current range could easily provide multibagger returns if Solana performs well in the next rally.\n\nXRP (XRP)\n\nA concept token for XRP with stacks of tokens in the background. XRP price predictions.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nXRP (XRP-USD) has been an underwhelming cryptocurrency so far, and I definitely understand the bearish sentiment here. It has been bleeding red ink in the long run, primarily due to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s case against Ripple. It has underperformed most of the major cryptos in recent rallies and is a very risky bet right now.\n\nThe company\u2019s case with the SEC has no end in sight, and it may be months or even years before there is a settlement, which will have a substantial impact on the entire cryptocurrency market on whether or not certain cryptos are considered securities. If the SEC fails to get a judgment on cryptos being securities, XRP will likely be a multibagger overnight. However, investors should be prepared to lose most of their investment if things don\u2019t go Ripple\u2019s way with the lawsuit.\n\nRegardless, the utility here is excellent due to Ripple\u2019s partnership with many of the top banks.\n\nOn Low-Capitalization and Low-Volume Cryptocurrencies: InvestorPlace does not regularly publish commentary about cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization of less than $100 million or trade with a volume less than $100,000 each day.

When we do publish commentary on low-volume crypto that may be affected by our commentary, we ask that InvestorPlace.com\u2019s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More: How to Avoid Popular Cryptocurrency Scams\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
