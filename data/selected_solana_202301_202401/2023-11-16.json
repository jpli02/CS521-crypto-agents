        "content": "As many major cryptocurrencies slipped into the red on Thursday following a rally earlier this week, one altcoin continued its hot streak.\n\nSOL, the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain, hit its highest price since May 2022, rising to $68 early Thursday. While retreating to $62 by the afternoon, it\u2019s still up more than 35% on the week, according to CoinGecko. SOL is up more than 500% from a Jan. 1 price of $9.97.\n\nA jump in Bitcoin's price over the past couple of weeks helped lift the overall market. The most popular cryptocurrency advanced to just under $38,000 last week\u2014and again on Wednesday\u2014before falling back to earth. The coin was up less than 1%, near $36,600, as of publication.\n\nFueling that rise is speculation tied to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s impending action on a spot Bitcoin ETF, which analysts say could be approved by early January.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rosy performance has helped lift a group of altcoins led by Solana, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and a main competitor to second-ranked Ether.\n\nExchange-traded products representing an index of alternative coins increased by 26% in October, according to a Thursday report by digital asset investment company Fineqia. Meanwhile, ETPs holding SOL increased 172% in assets under management last month to $279 million from $102 million at the end of September. Last week alone, investors poured $12 million into ETPs tracking Solana, while pulling back from funds related to other altcoins like Litecoin and XRP, according to a report by CoinShares.\n\nSOL bottomed out near $9 toward the end of 2022 in the wake of FTX's meltdown. The coin had been mentioned among Sam Bankman-Fried's favorites, and it was mentioned frequently during former the FTX CEO's trial, but investors appear to have shrugged that off.\n\nThe Solana network is in the process of rolling out several improvements and has vastly improved on its downtime problem, which in past years took the network offline for hours at a time. The network has only had one such incident this year.\n\nAnother possible reason for Solana\u2019s recent price increases could be a significant uptick in liquid staking, including through applications like Jito, Marinade, and MarginFi, said Max Shannon, a research analyst at CoinShares. Another driver could be an increase in open interest volume and funding rates fueled by a surge in liquidations, while some investors may just see it as a sound play, Shannon added.\n\n\u201cThe 94% price decline from peak to trough makes it an attractive proposition regardless of fundamentals, and investors could be starting to realize this,\u201d Shannon said in an email.\n\nAnother analyst, Matteo Greco of Fineqia, cautioned that Solana\u2019s price moves are closely tied to its pitiful performance near the end of 2022. Due in part to FTX and Alameda Research\u2019s close association, and substantial exposure to SOL, the token fell drastically.\n\nDespite SOL's massive uptick, Greco noted, it's still way off its all-time high of nearly $260.\n\n\u201cThe remarkable uptrend in SOL,\" he added, \"can be directly linked to the severe impact the token endured during the downturn.\""

        "title": "Why Hasn't Solana Died Yet? - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "Crypto market observers noticed a long time ago: after a significant surge in Bitcoin price, there always comes the \u201calts\u201d time. The whole market seems to be dragged by the leading crypto, but some coins outperform the others.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past month, Bitcoin surged 38%. Ethereum gained 32%. Meanwhile, Solana spiked 175%, and Grayscale\u2019s GSOL trust shares skyrocketed to a jaw-dropping premium of 784%. This means that both retail and institutional investors are turning their eyes to this underdog blockchain, which has been declared dead so many times in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana is indeed infamous for numerous network outages, and its reputation was badly hurt by the FTX crash (the bankrupt exchange invested heavily in $SOL and co-founded the blockchain\u2019s main DEX Serum).\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of FTX: for the past two weeks, it has been selling between $250,000 and $700,000 worth of $SOL every day, creating additional selling pressure on the coin. Despite that, its price never ceased climbing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, the larger crypto (and not only) public starts wondering what\u2019s the secret to Solana\u2019s ability to bounce back after every obstacle. And why are investors rushing to it now, leaving the market leader Ethereum behind?\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s try to answer this question by looking at the current state of Solana and its main pros and cons: the outages, the activity, and the tokenomics. But first, a quick reminder of what sets this blockchain apart from its competitors.\n\nHow is Solana different from other blockchains?\n\nSolana is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that relies on validators who stake its native currency $SOL. In addition to that, it also uses the so-called Proof of History mechanism, which allows it to speed up transaction validation, all while keeping the blockchain synchronized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTraditional\u201d blockchains synchronize on blocks, which means that a transaction cannot be processed until a block time has passed. To allow PoS blockchain validators to determine the order of the blocks, those need to be timestamped, and in order to counter the clock drift and network latencies, the block time needs to be lengthened.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana is different in that its leader nodes \u201ctimestamp\u201d the blocks with cryptographic proofs that some duration of time has passed since the last proof. Validator nodes verify these proofs in any order, allowing network participants to synchronize at their own pace.\n\nOverall, this system streamlines the transaction validation process and allows Solana to scale as its network grows.\n\nDid Solana resolve its outage problem?\n\nThis scaling promise has been challenged on multiple occasions, especially in 2022, when the network faced no less than 10 partial or full outages, some of them lasting many hours. On occasions, the Solana clock was also noticed to be running adrift of real-world time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2022, Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko admitted that the validator count doubling in the previous year put the system to the test and revealed a number of inherent problems. He ensured that the team was working on resolving them, and indeed, so far in 2023, the network suffered only one major outage in February. The current streak of 260 days of uptime is the second-best in Solana\u2019s history. Whether it should be attributed to the upgrade-process improvements and new technical features, or rather the bear market\u2019s relatively low network activity, remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year Yakovenko also announced that Solana Foundation had partnered with the development firm Jump Crypto to build an alternative client. Having a \u201csecond implementation and a second client developed by a different team with a fully separate code base\u201d was supposed to help eliminate the same type of bugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis alternative validator client, named Firedancer, was revealed two weeks ago (in testnet version), at Solana\u2019s Breakpoint conference in Amsterdam. $SOL gained over 66% since then.\n\nSolana today\n\nAs of today, Solana is the most used blockchain, as it processes around 37 million daily non-vote transactions \u2013 more than any other chain. For comparison, Ethereum processes around 1.1 million transactions per day. Adding its most popular layer-2s, this number can rise to 4.5 million (Polygon PoS 2.5M, zkSync 738k, Arbitrum 620k, Optimism 347k, Base 255k).\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana\u2019s current TPS (transaction per second) stands at around 4000 (including vote transactions), and the developing team claims it can go up to 50,000. The blockchain counts nearly a million unique monthly active users and 2,000 validators.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year for Solana was marked by several important events, such as the release of its phone Saga, an Android reinforced with a native crypto custody system, and web3 integration. Solana was also chosen by VISA for USDC stablecoin settlement, and one of the DeFi OGs MakerDAO decided to leave Ethereum for a new blockchain forked off Solana.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeFi activity is steadily gaining intensity after a dramatic fall at the end of 2022, while the NFT activity has fallen (source: Messari).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, amidst this enthusiasm, a key problem persists \u2013 Solana\u2019s tokenomics.\n\nCan Solana economy work?\n\nWhile low fees are good for the users, this is not always the case for the blockchain. Solana\u2019s average fee of $0.0002 is so low that it would need 8.8 billion daily transactions to just break even on the current 4% inflation. In other words, multiply the current activity by 237.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite its high transaction throughput, Solana is still the poor neighbor: while Ethereum currently earns $4.7 million per day in gas fees, Solana collects only $10k (source: Nansen).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis situation takes its toll on the validators too. Although the network does not require a minimal staking amount, according to this profit calculator, Solana validator node\u2019s yearly break even currently stands at 106k of delegated $SOL ($6.2M) or 5.3k of self-staked $SOL ($310k).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, a person who wishes to solo run an Ethereum validator node could break even and even gain a little income by staking 64 ETH, or $131.4k. Both simulations include server costs and current crypto rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor liquid staking, Solana\u2019s current rate is 2.9%, vs Ethereum\u2019s 3.9%.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana\u2019s business model is built on the idea of hyper-scalability, and if the blockchain does not attract the necessary amount of activity, it will not be able to sustain itself. And as it turns out, a lot of people believe that this level of activity is just a matter of time. The Solana community is big and enthusiastic, and pushing through a rough patch after the FTX crash may have made it even stronger.\n\nWhy did the $SOL price surge?\n\nIt is a very long way ahead for Solana to make its business model work, and the reason the markets are now treating $SOL with irrational premiums is based solely on the positive future outlook.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lindy effect says that the future life expectancy of non-perishable things, like technologies or ideas, is proportional to their current age. As Solana stubbornly refuses to die, methodically solving the problems that come its way, the blockchain\u2019s chances to be here for the bright web3 future increase accordingly.\n\nAlso published here.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "How Solana Works: A Beginner's Guide - Blockgeeks",
        "content": "Did you know that Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform in the crypto industry, processes over 65,000 transactions per second? Solana is often seen as an ethereum killer and is gaining popularity alongside bitcoin and cardano. That\u2019s more than 10 times the bandwidth capacity of the crypto industry\u2019s Ethereum and Bitcoin projects combined, on a standard gigabit network! Solana is revolutionizing the world of decentralized applications by providing lightning-fast solutions for developers and users in the crypto space. With its innovative approach, Solana is becoming a major player in the bitcoin and ethereum communities, offering scalable solutions that enhance the efficiency of projects and systems.\n\nUsing a unique combination of cutting-edge technologies, Solana uses ethereum and proof-of-stake (POS) to design a system that offers low transaction fees and high throughput, making it ideal for a wide range of projects. Ethereum uses an innovative consensus mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH) to ensure secure and efficient data processing in the blockchain cluster. By leveraging the delegated proof of ethereum mechanism along with other advanced algorithms and protocols, Solana creates a robust network where participants can execute smart contracts seamlessly in the next block.\n\nWith its exceptional performance and design, Solana is poised to transform the way we interact with ethereum blockchain technology. Solana uses a cluster to achieve its outstanding speed and efficiency, making it a game-changing solution in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Does Solana Work? Exploring the Features\n\nSolana is an impressive blockchain platform that sets itself apart from others in the market with its efficient and scalable network of Ethereum nodes. Ethereum boasts several unique features that contribute to its scalability, speed, and overall user experience. These features include the ability to process transactions through nodes and the efficient validation of the next block. Let\u2019s delve into these features and understand how Solana, with its next block and nodes, works.\n\nAbility to handle thousands of transactions per second\n\nOne of the standout features of Solana is its remarkable ability to handle thousands of transactions per second. While other blockchains like Ethereum struggle with scalability issues, Solana has found a way to overcome this hurdle. By utilizing an innovative architecture and advanced consensus mechanism, Solana can process a high volume of transactions simultaneously.\n\nLeveraging Proof-of-History for enhanced scalability and speed\n\nTo achieve its impressive transaction processing capabilities, Solana leverages a mechanism known as Proof-of-History (PoH). PoH enables the network to establish an ordered sequence of events or \u201cproofs\u201d that occur over time. This allows validators on the network to quickly verify the order and authenticity of transactions without relying solely on computation-based mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nSupport for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps)\n\nAnother key feature of Solana is its support for smart contracts, enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that automatically execute predefined actions when certain conditions are met. With Solana\u2019s smart contract functionality, developers have the freedom to create innovative dApps across various industries such as finance, gaming, supply chain management, and more.\n\nParallel transaction processing reducing congestion on the network\n\nSolana\u2019s architecture allows for parallel transaction processing, which significantly reduces congestion on the network. Unlike traditional blockchains where each transaction must be processed sequentially in blocks, Solana employs a unique approach called \u201cpipelining.\u201d This means that multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously, improving overall throughput and reducing transaction confirmation times.\n\nImproved user experience compared to other blockchains\n\nWith its unique features and architecture, Solana offers an improved user experience compared to other blockchains. The ability to handle a high volume of transactions per second ensures that users can transact quickly and efficiently. The reduced congestion on the network leads to faster transaction confirmations and lower fees, making Solana an attractive choice for users seeking a seamless blockchain experience.\n\nUnderstanding the Technology and Mechanisms Behind Solana\n\nTo truly comprehend how Solana works, it\u2019s essential to delve into the technology and mechanisms that power this innovative blockchain platform. Solana combines various algorithms and consensus mechanisms to achieve its impressive transaction throughput and scalability.\n\nProof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\n\nSolana employs a unique consensus algorithm called Proof-of-History (PoH), which works in conjunction with Proof-of-Stake (PoS). PoH serves as a verifiable historical record that enhances efficiency and security on the network. It provides a chronological order of events, allowing validators to quickly validate transactions without needing to process every single one.\n\nTower BFT Consensus\n\nIn addition to PoH, Solana utilizes Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus for finalizing blocks rapidly. This consensus mechanism enables validators to reach an agreement on the state of the blockchain by participating in a voting process. Validators play a crucial role in maintaining consensus by staking SOL tokens as collateral. By doing so, they have an economic incentive to act honestly and follow the rules of the network.\n\nFast Confirmation Times and High Reliability\n\nBy combining these technologies, Solana achieves incredibly fast confirmation times while maintaining high reliability. The use of PoH allows validators to skip unnecessary computations, enabling faster processing of transactions. Thanks to its scalable architecture, Solana can handle high transaction volumes without compromising speed or security.\n\nSolana\u2019s ability to process thousands of transactions per second sets it apart from many other blockchain platforms. With its high bandwidth capacity and efficient validation mechanisms, Solana has become well-suited for applications requiring rapid transaction processing times.\n\nValidators: The Backbone of Consensus\n\nValidators play a critical role in ensuring the integrity and security of the Solana network. These individuals or entities are responsible for validating transactions, creating new blocks, and finalizing the blockchain\u2019s state. To become a validator, one must stake a certain number of SOL tokens as collateral.\n\nValidators are incentivized to act honestly and follow the rules of the network. If they attempt to engage in malicious behavior or validate incorrect transactions, they risk losing their staked tokens. This economic incentive ensures that validators have a vested interest in maintaining consensus and securing the network.\n\nTokenomics and Staking\n\nSolana\u2019s native token is called SOL, which serves multiple purposes within the ecosystem. Aside from being used for transaction fees, SOL tokens can be staked by participants to support the network\u2019s security and consensus mechanisms. Validators stake their SOL tokens as collateral, while token holders can also choose to delegate their tokens to trusted validators.\n\nBy staking or delegating SOL tokens, participants contribute to Solana\u2019s overall security and receive rewards in return. These rewards serve as an additional incentive for individuals to actively participate in maintaining the network\u2019s integrity.\n\nHow Solana Functions as a Cryptocurrency\n\nSolana, like many other blockchain networks, has its native cryptocurrency called SOL. This digital currency plays a crucial role within the Solana ecosystem, enabling various functionalities and incentivizing network participation.\n\nSOL: The Native Cryptocurrency of Solana\n\nSOL serves as the primary medium of exchange within the Solana blockchain. Users can hold SOL tokens in their wallets, transfer them between different addresses, or use them for payments within decentralized applications (dApps). Similar to how we use traditional money for transactions, SOL facilitates financial activities on the Solana network.\n\nStaking SOL for Network Security and Rewards\n\nOne unique feature of Solana is that users can stake their SOL tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards in return. When individuals stake their tokens, they essentially lock them up in a wallet to support the validation process of transactions on the blockchain. This staking mechanism not only enhances network security but also encourages active participation from token holders.\n\nBy staking SOL, participants contribute to maintaining the integrity and decentralization of the Solana network. In return for their contribution, they receive rewards in the form of additional SOL tokens. These rewards serve as an incentive for users to hold onto their tokens rather than selling them immediately.\n\nFixed Total Supply Ensuring Scarcity\n\nThe total supply of SOL tokens is fixed at 489 million. This means that there will never be more than 489 million SOL tokens in existence. The limited supply ensures scarcity over time, which can have implications on its value and demand. As with any asset that exhibits scarcity, if demand increases while supply remains constant or decreases, it can potentially drive up the price of SOL.\n\nThe fixed total supply also provides confidence to investors and users that there won\u2019t be sudden inflationary events affecting their holdings. With a known maximum supply already established, individuals can make informed decisions about acquiring and holding SOL based on their understanding of the token\u2019s potential value.\n\nIncentivizing Network Participation and Ecosystem Growth\n\nSolana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, plays a crucial role in incentivizing network participation and driving ecosystem growth. By offering rewards for staking SOL tokens, individuals are encouraged to actively engage with the Solana blockchain. This engagement helps secure the network while simultaneously fostering its development and expansion.\n\nThe use of SOL as a medium of exchange within dApps also creates demand for the cryptocurrency. As more decentralized applications are built on the Solana platform, users will require SOL tokens to access and utilize these applications. This demand can contribute to the overall growth and adoption of Solana as a blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe Proof of History Concept in Solana\n\nProof-of-History (PoH) is a unique concept introduced by Solana to order and timestamp transactions. This innovative mechanism plays a vital role in the efficiency, security, and decentralization of the Solana blockchain.\n\nEfficient Verification with PoH\n\nOne of the key advantages of PoH is its ability to provide a historical record that enables efficient verification of the blockchain\u2019s state. By incorporating timestamps into the consensus model, PoH allows validators to process transactions quickly without relying solely on computational power. This means that even with high transaction volumes, Solana can maintain fast throughput and low latency.\n\nPreventing Transaction Manipulation\n\nAnother crucial aspect of PoH is its role in enhancing security by preventing malicious actors from manipulating transaction order. With traditional blockchains, achieving consensus on the chronological order of transactions can be challenging. However, thanks to PoH\u2019s verifiable delay function and use of clocks, Solana ensures that all participants agree on the correct sequence of events.\n\nBy leveraging PoH\u2019s history algorithm, Solana creates a reliable timeline for transactions. Validators can easily verify this historical record and confirm the validity and order of each transaction. This prevents any attempts at reordering or tampering with transactions after they have been added to the blockchain.\n\nHigh Throughput and Low Latency\n\nSolana\u2019s implementation of PoH allows it to achieve remarkable levels of scalability without sacrificing decentralization. The combination of fast throughput and low latency makes it an ideal platform for applications requiring quick transaction processing times.\n\nWith other blockchains, increasing throughput often comes at the cost of centralization as validators need more computational power to keep up with demand. However, Solana\u2019s use of PoH enables validators to process transactions efficiently without compromising on decentralization.\n\nConsensus through Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)\n\nTo further enhance its consensus mechanism, Solana utilizes a variant of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). This consensus model involves a set of validators who are responsible for validating and adding transactions to the blockchain. These validators are chosen based on their stake in the network, ensuring that those with the highest stakes have a greater influence over the consensus process.\n\nBy combining DPoS with PoH, Solana achieves a robust and efficient consensus mechanism. Validators can quickly reach agreement on transaction order, while PoH provides an additional layer of security against manipulation attempts.\n\nBenefits of PoH in Solana\n\nThe Proof-of-History concept in Solana brings several benefits to the blockchain ecosystem:\n\nEfficiency : PoH enables fast transaction processing without relying solely on computational power.\n\nSecurity : By preventing transaction manipulation, PoH enhances the security and integrity of the Solana blockchain.\n\nScalability : With high throughput and low latency, Solana can handle large transaction volumes without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nReliability: The historical record provided by PoH ensures that all participants agree on the correct sequence of events, eliminating disputes over transaction order.\n\nStaking and Its Role in the Solana Ecosystem\n\nStaking SOL tokens is a fundamental mechanism that plays a crucial role in securing the Solana network. Validators, who are responsible for validating transactions and creating blocks on the blockchain, stake their SOL as collateral to ensure honest participation in block validation.\n\nBy staking their tokens, participants have the opportunity to earn rewards based on their stake and active involvement in consensus. This incentivizes validators to act honestly and maintain the integrity of the network. The more SOL tokens someone stakes, the higher their chances of being selected as a validator and earning rewards.\n\nStakers are vital for maintaining the security of the Solana ecosystem. When a participant stakes their tokens, they contribute to the overall decentralization of the network by becoming a part of its consensus mechanism. This means that multiple validators work together to validate transactions and create new blocks, ensuring that no single entity has complete control over the network.\n\nThe Solana blockchain utilizes sharding technology, which allows it to scale efficiently while maintaining high throughput. Validators play an essential role in this process by verifying transactions within their assigned shard or subgroup of nodes. By doing so, they help ensure that transactions are processed quickly and efficiently across different shards.\n\nOne of the benefits of staking SOL tokens is that it encourages long-term commitment to the growth and sustainability of the Solana ecosystem. Validators who stake their tokens demonstrate their belief in Solana\u2019s potential by locking up their funds for an extended period. This commitment fosters stability within the network and attracts other participants who share similar goals.\n\nIn addition to earning rewards through staking, validators also have certain responsibilities within the Solana ecosystem. They must continuously monitor and upgrade their hardware infrastructure to keep up with increasing demands on processing power and storage capacity. Validators need to maintain reliable internet connections since any downtime could impact block production.\n\nValidators also need to stay updated with protocol upgrades and changes implemented by Solana\u2019s development team. This ensures that they can adapt their validation processes accordingly and remain in sync with the network.\n\nWhile staking SOL tokens offers numerous benefits, it is essential to consider potential risks and challenges associated with this process. Validators need to carefully manage their staked tokens since any malicious behavior or failure to fulfill their responsibilities could result in penalties or loss of stake.\n\nFurthermore, participants should be aware of the potential risks associated with the volatility of cryptocurrency markets. The value of staked tokens can fluctuate significantly, which may impact the overall returns earned through staking.\n\nEvaluating Solana as an Investment Opportunity in Crypto\n\nAs one of the fastest-growing blockchain platforms, Solana has caught the attention of many investors looking for promising opportunities in the crypto industry.
