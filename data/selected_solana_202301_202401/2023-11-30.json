        "content": "A pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst issued a warning to investors and traders in the digital currency ecosystem, predicting a gradual decline for several prominent cryptocurrencies, including Solana SOL/USD, Chainlink LINK/USD, Avalanche AVAX/USD and the decentralized finance (DeFi) token Rune RUNE/USD.\n\nAltcoin Sherpa's analysis focused on specific technical indicators, particularly the .382 Fibonacci retracement levels and the 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the four-hour charts.\n\nThese indicators are often used by traders to predict potential reversal points or support levels in the market.\n\nIn the tweet, Altcoin Sherpa said, \"Many .382 fibs + 200 EMAs (4h) are coming up on some of the best coins. $LINK $SOL $AVAX. These areas + the .50 fib are the regions I'm eyeing.\"\n\nThis suggested Altcoin Sherpa was closely monitoring these levels as potential areas where the price might stabilize or rebound.\n\nThe analyst expected a \"grind down\" period for these cryptocurrencies before any significant upward trend continued. This term refers to a slow and steady price decline rather than a sharp drop.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin's Retail Revolution: Will Small Investors Drive The Future?\n\nAltcoin Sherpa believed this gradual decrease would lead to a period of consolidation, which was a phase when prices stabilize and move sideways.\n\nThe analyst anticipated this consolidation will form a strong base for a potential robust upward movement in January for many of these digital assets.\n\nRegarding the DeFi token RUNE, Altcoin Sherpa's analysis followed a similar pattern.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cRUNE: Same setup as the others\u2026would love to see a 0.382 [Fibonacci level] tap +200 exponential moving average on the four-hour chart.\u201d\n\nThis indicated his expectation that RUNE would also experience a decline to its .382 Fibonacci level combined with the 200 EMA, which could be a crucial juncture for the token.\n\nRead Next: Wormhole's Astronomical Funding Round: A Giant Leap For Blockchain Interoperability"

        "content": "After several days of heading south, bitcoin\u2019s price finally reversed its trajectory and pumped above $38,000 in the past 24 hours.\n\nMost altcoins have also turned green today, with ETH jumping to over $2,000 and XRP defending the $0.6 level.\n\nBTC Back Above $38K\n\nBitcoin registered its highest price tag in over a year and a half on Friday when the bulls initiated a notable leg up that resulted in tapping $38,500. However, the asset couldn\u2019t sustain its momentum and quickly went back below $38,000.\n\nThe weekend was calmer, as bitcoin traded sideways at around $37,000. Monday and Tuesday, though, were a lot less positive, with bitcoin slipping below $37,000 for the first time in nearly a week.\n\nNevertheless, the bulls took charge hours ago once again. They propelled another rally that resulted in touching $38,400 hours ago.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

Its market cap has increased to $750 billion, and its dominance over the alternative coins is up to 52%.\n\nSOL, RUNE on the Rise\n\nAs it typically happens when BTC heads in either direction, so do most of the altcoins. Ethereum, for instance, has jumped by 2.5% and has reclaimed the $2,000 resistance. Binance Coin is at $230, while XRP remains above $0.6.\n\nCardano, Dogecoin, Polygon, and Polkadot have all added around 4% overnight, while LINK, AVAX, NEAR, and MNT are up by 5-7%.\n\nSolana and THORChain have gained the most from the larger-cap alts. SOL is up by 11% and trades above $60, while RUNE has soared by 14.5% and sits well above $6.\n\nThe total crypto market cap has added over $30 billion in a day. As a result, the metric now stands over $1.430 trillion on CMC."

        "title": "Better Buy: XRP or Solana? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If you're deciding between XRP and Solana, here's what you need to know.\n\nBitcoin traditionally leads the way in any new bull market rally for the crypto market. And that's precisely what has happened this year. Bitcoin's massive triple-digit gains this year have lifted the entire market, encouraging investors to seek out new altcoins (i.e., any coin that's not Bitcoin) to add to their portfolios.\n\nTwo altcoins that particularly stand out right now are XRP (XRP 1.65%) and Solana (SOL 1.05%). Both have turned in stellar performances this year, and both are showing up on the radar screens of investors looking for large-market-cap cryptos with long-term upside potential. So let's dig in to see which one is the better buy right now.\n\nRecent performance\n\nFor the year, Solana has easily been the better performer, delivering 465% returns. Solana started the year trading for just $10, and is now trading around $55. Of all 25 cryptocurrencies with a greater than $3 billion market cap, Solana now ranks as the top performer of 2023, and it's not even close.\n\nOn the other hand, XRP has more closely tracked the performance of Ethereum. XRP is up 79% for the year, while Ethereum is up 70% for the year. Granted, XRP nearly doubled in price in mid-summer, but it has now given back almost all of those gains. So if you're only thinking short term, then Solana is the obvious winner.\n\nLong-term growth prospects\n\nBut, remember, we're long-term investors here, and what we should really be interested in is the long-term growth potential of these cryptos, not recent market performance. And that's where things get interesting, because you could easily argue that XRP has the higher upside potential of the two, simply because it seems to be further along on the path to mainstream adoption.\n\nXRP is the token powering the Ripple payment platform, which is a decentralized blockchain network primarily used for making cross-border transfers at very low cost. Since the launch of this payment network nearly a decade ago, Ripple Labs (the creators of the XRP token) has partnered with major financial institutions to build this technology.\n\nThe focus for XRP has primarily been on cross-border remittances. However, the hope is that, as more and more financial institutions embrace this technology, new use cases could emerge. Most interestingly, the underlying Ripple payment technology could be used in the development of new central bank digital currencies.\n\nIn comparison, Solana's blockchain platform is much more in the early stages. That makes sense, since Solana only officially launched in 2020. Yes, everyone agrees that the Solana blockchain is already one of the fastest in the industry, capable of processing 65,000 transactions per second. But the big question is how institutions are actually going to use this extremely fast transaction-processing capability. One clue came this September, when Solana announced a partnership with Visa on the launch of a new payment project featuring stablecoins.\n\nThe regulatory factor\n\nIt's almost impossible to talk about these two cryptos without also mentioning the SEC. XRP has been embroiled in a long-running court battle with the SEC since December 2020. The SEC claims that XRP is actually an \"unregistered security,\" and not a cryptocurrency. And Solana ran into trouble with the SEC this year, when three different court cases filed against major cryptocurrency exchanges indirectly named Solana as a potential \"unregistered security.\"\n\nSo you can see the problem here. Both cryptocurrencies come with a sizable amount of regulatory risk. From my perspective, the XRP court battle seems to be nearing the final stages, while the Solana court battle may just be getting started. XRP's court battle has already lasted three years, and top executives at Ripple say it may end up costing more than $200 million to fight the SEC. So just imagine the potential future impact on Solana if the SEC is really serious about moving forward with any sort of enforcement action.\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nAs much as the choice between XRP and Solana should be about current market performance and future upside potential, it's really all about regulatory risk. If you are extremely risk-averse, then both of these cryptos may be too hot to handle. But, if you are willing to accept some of the volatility caused by regulatory risk, then Solana might end up being the better option. For now, Solana has only been mentioned indirectly in other lawsuits, and there is no sign that the SEC is ready to move directly against Solana.\n\nMoreover, I really believe in the long-term growth potential of Solana. From my perspective, Solana is just now starting to fire on all cylinders and deliver on its early promise of being an \"Ethereum killer,\" while XRP seems to have taken several steps backward as the result of its long-running SEC court battle. If forced to choose between XRP and Solana, I'm picking Solana."
