That\u2019s because Sunland Park Mall has a new owner and with that comes a brand new name, too.\n\nIt was announced that Sunland Park Mall was bought by the president and owner of Starr Western Wear which currently has a location at the westside mall.\n\nThe new owner, Enoch Kimmelman, is hoping to bring back life to what he calls the crown jewel of the Westside.\n\nKimmelman hopes to turn the mall into a place where families can enjoy entertainment, food, and of course some shopping!\n\nAlong with being the new owner of Sunland Park Mall, Kimmelman also told local media that he will rename the mall: \"The Shoppes at Solana.\"\n\nCourtesy: The Shoppes at Solana Courtesy: The Shoppes at Solana loading...\n\nThe mall (formerly known as Sunland Park Mall) will remain open during construction, but if you plan on heading out to the mall just keep a heads up for construction because they will be doing all construction in phases to avoid disrupting and current businesses at the mall.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Sunland Park Mall has been struggling over the past several years especially during the pandemic so although this news may be a bit shocking to some, I\u2019m hoping that the change will turn Sunland Park Mall into what it used to be back when I was a teen.\n\nWhen the news was announced, many locals had mixed reactions. I wanted to see what stores locals would like to see in the \u201cnew\u201d mall and some of these ideas were pretty great!

        "content": "\n\nDisclaimer: The CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency community price estimate is based only on the votes of its users. Estimates do not guarantee end-of-month prices.\n\nThe price trajectory of Solana (SOL) has undeniably captivated the attention of numerous investors in the last week, as this asset has demonstrated a remarkable surge, ascending by an impressive 17% within the past seven days.\n\nResuming its ascent, Solana has managed to surpass the psychologically significant threshold of $20, testing the resistance level at $22. However, for astute crypto traders, the forthcoming critical juncture lies in Solana\u2019s quest to recapture the coveted $30 mark, a price point it has not attained since June 2023.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the latest price developments surrounding this digital asset, Finbold sought SOL predictions from the crypto community at CoinMarketCap on July 13. These valuable inputs are crucial in order to gauge the prevailing atmosphere surrounding this decentralized finance (DeFi) cryptocurrency, which has recently been the center of attention.\n\nBased on the insights gained from the community\u2019s voting patterns over the past six months, which have shown a historical accuracy rate of 91.95%, Solana is predicted to trade at an average price of $22.48. This projection reflects a marginal increase of 2% from its current price at the time of publication.\n\nCoinMarketCap community\u2019s SOL price prediction for July 31. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nSolana June estimate\n\nConsidering the community\u2019s most recent price estimate for the end of June, their success rate in predicting the price of Solana stood at an impressive 89%.\n\nCoinMarketCap community\u2019s SOL price estimation accuracy over the past six months. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHowever, it is crucial to recognize that past performance does not guarantee future results. While the community\u2019s track record is noteworthy, it is essential to consider other factors that can influence the price of SOL in the future.\n\nSOL leads top 100 cryptocurrencies in 7-day gains\n\nIt is worth highlighting that Solana has emerged as the frontrunner regarding gains within the cryptocurrency market when considering the top 100 digital assets over the past week.\n\nCoinMarketCap top 100 gainers past week. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe assets following Solana in this regard are Compound (COMP) and Polygon (MATIC), further solidifying the impressive performance of SOL during this period.\n\nSolana chart analysis\n\nSolana is currently trading at $22, reflecting a modest 0.1% increase in price for the day. Over the past week, SOL has experienced a remarkable surge, appreciating 17%.\n\nSOL seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nExamining SOL\u2019s recent performance, it is worth noting that out of the past 30 trading days, SOL has had 20 green days, accounting for approximately 67% of the observed period.\n\nNevertheless, Solana has experienced a significant price decline over the past year, with a notable decrease of -34%. This performance places the token below the average performance of 78% of the top 100 crypto assets during the same period. Furthermore, major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have outperformed the digital asset.\n\nConsidering these factors, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough analysis before making any investment decisions related to SOL. The current price trends, underperformance compared to other cryptocurrencies, trading below the 200-day moving average, overbought conditions, and the substantial decline from its all-time high all suggest a challenging market environment for SOL in the recent past.\n\nRead also: How to Buy Solana (SOL) in 2 Minutes\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
