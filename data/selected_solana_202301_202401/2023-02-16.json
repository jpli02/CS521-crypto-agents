        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nTraders betting on a market-wide decline were caught off guard as a broader market recovery in the past 24 hours saw $185 million in shorts, or bets against price rises, getting liquidated.\n\nThat contributed to over $200 million in overall liquidation losses. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader\u2019s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader\u2019s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).\n\nLarge liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move \u2013 which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.\n\nBitcoin-tracked futures saw over $85 million in liquidations alone, the highest among all cryptocurrencies. Ether futures logged $58 million in liquidations, while futures of aptos, solana and solana each saw losses between $3 million to $4 million.\n\nCrypto exchange Binance recorded the most losses among its counterparts at $68 million, followed by OKX at $51 million.\n\nCrypto market capitalization increased 8.8% to reach its highest level since November, erasing losses from the contagion effects stemming from FTX\u2019s collapse and troubles at crypto lender Genesis. (Genesis and CoinDesk share the same parent company, DCG.)\n\nBitcoin and ether rose to over $24,500 and $1,600 respectively, leading to a market-wide recovery. Okb, the native tokens of crypto exchange OKX, surged 20%, the most among major cryptocurrencies, while BNB Chain\u2019s bnb (BNB) rose to $323 in Asian afternoon hours \u2013 reversing losses from earlier this week.\n\nTokens of layer 1 blockchains solana (SOL) and Polygon's MATIC added 10% apiece in the past 24 hours. Elsewhere, artificial intelligence-focused tokens such as fetch (FET) and AGIX continued their week-long run, adding over 12%."

Interest in the company has been growing at an incredible rate thanks to the rise of the NFT marketplace.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how many Solana coins there are in circulation or whether there\u2019s a maximum Solana total supply, read on.\n\nHow Many Solana Coins Are in Circulation?\n\nAs of July 2022, there are approximately 345,896,304.32 Solana (SOL) coins in circulation. This Solana supply equates to a value of $12,67,76,097 in cryptocurrency. The 24-hour trading volume for Solana reached $1,216,780,757 on the 27th of July 2022, though the coin faced a slight drop in value over the month of July.\n\n(CoinMarketCap)\n\nExploring the Solana Supply Limit\n\nSolana is an open-source project that uses Blockchain's permissionless nature to deliver decentralized finance solutions. Though work on the initial project for Solana started in 2017, the project was only officially launched in 2020.\n\nOver the last two years, interest in Solana has increased due to its incredibly short processing times, and it\u2019s ability to manage transactions without high fees and taxes.\n\nThe max supply of Solana coins is currently at 511,616,946.\n\nSimilar to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Solana has a limit on how many coins can ever be available in circulation. However, the max supply of Solana available to investors is not fixed. Instead, the number of tokens in circulation changes according to inflation.\n\nWhen the Solana network first launched, it had a total supply of 500,000,000 SOL. However, the foundation responsible for the coin burned around 11 million SOL. Since then, the SOL inflation schedule has brought the max supply back over the initial cap.\n\n(CoinMarketCap)\n\nThe current value of a Solana coin is $36.67.\n\nThe Solana coins in circulation are currently valued at a price of $36.67 per coin (as of July 2022). Though this may seem like quite a high price for an alt coin, it\u2019s a significant drop from the coin\u2019s all-time high of $260.06 per coin.\n\nIn a 24-hour period on the 27th of July 2022, the total dollar transaction value of all SOL purchases equaled $1.2 billion.\n\n(Coinbase)\n\nSolana is a proof-of-stake token and cannot be mined.\n\nSolana owners are not miners like many other cryptocurrency investors. Similar to other tokens like ADA, SOL is a proof-of-stake coin, which means it cannot be mined. Instead, to earn value from a SOL investment, a Solana crypto owner needs to \u201cstake\u201d the token.\n\nThis means you place your coin in an online account, and a validator on the Solana network will pay rewards of around 8% of your coins to your account. The online accounts help to validate other transactions made in SOL.\n\n(SolanaCompass)\n\nSolana\u2019s inflation rate is 8% annually.\n\nThe Solana inflation rate dictates how many coins are in circulation and the rewards investors can access by owning SOL tokens. There are different ways to earn rewards with SOL. A regular Solana owner will earn around 8% of their coins back each year by \u201cstaking\u201d their investment, with a decrease of around 15% a year. This leads to a long-term fixed inflation rate of 1.5% per year.\n\nValidators in the SOL ecosystem, who check the status of accounts and distribute rewards, also receive a 5% annual reward for their work.\n\n(Blockdaemon)\n\nExperts predict Solana will reach a value of $174.43 per coin in 2025.\n\nAlthough it can be difficult to give an accurate Solana price prediction, experts performing technical analyses of the coin\u2019s development have given their opinion. Many experts believe the minimum price of SOL in 2025 will be approximately $174.43 per coin.\n\nHowever, some believe the value will be even higher than this, up to approximately $213.55. By 2030, the same experts predict SOL will reach a minimum value of $1,348.61.\n\n(Changelly)\n\nSolana User Growth Over the Years\n\nAlthough SOL has had some dips in popularity over the last two years, it remains to be a highly sought-after cryptocurrency investment. As buyers continue to search for more affordable ways to expand their cryptocurrency portfolio, Solana\u2019s technology could continue to grab attention.\n\nSources:\n\nRelated Blockchain Content"
