        "content": "Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jamie Coutts says that Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) is well-positioned to perform stronger against fellow ETH rival Cardano (ADA).\n\nCoutts says that Solana has a lot more daily users than Cardano but that ADA\u2019s market cap is still about 75% of SOL\u2019s market cap.\n\nHe believes Cardano will start market share to the more active Solana ecosystem, driving SOL up against ADA (SOLUSD/ADAUSD).\n\n\u201cCardano still commands a market cap of 75% of Solana despite only having 16% of the daily users.

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt's been a bullish week for three of the market's largest altcoins XRP, Cardano, and Solana.\n\nXRP has enjoyed a hefty rally, hitting nearly 20% in the last seven days. It's now trading hands at just under $0.69 after falling some early Tuesday morning. That price now puts the token at a three-month high.\n\nThis week's rally is just the latest in a longer stretch of bullish fortune for XRP.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in October, U.S. District Court judge Torres blocked the Securities and Exchange Commission's appeal for a previous ruling earlier that summer. Torres wrote that the SEC failed to show that the summer's decision was sufficiently faulty or problematic.\n\nTorres was the same judge who oversaw the initial ruling in July too. At that time, she ruled that the sale of XRP tokens was not securities except in the case that institutions were the buyers. This marked a key step in Ripple's ongoing case with the SEC which kicked off in 2020.\n\nCardano's native asset ADA is also riding high amid an ongoing rally. Up nearly 17% in the last seven days, the move comes amid the continued rollout of the Cardano Midnight protocol, a privacy-centric blockchain drawing from many of the same components as Cardano.\n\nLast week, the protocol opened its doors to the first wave of \"Midnight Pioneers\" or developers that can begin building on the network.\n\nFinally, Solana continues to nab headlines amid its hefty surge and its Breakpoint event in Amsterdam last week. SOL is currently trading at $40.89 at press time and is up a whopping 11.7% over the past week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAltcoins, Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThis latest surge comes amid the largely flat crypto market, where most of the top coins are trading sideways or slightly down.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is hovering around $34,660, down 1.5% in the same period. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest coin, is changing hands at $1,872, down 1.3% over the span.\n\nThe total crypto market cap is currently around $1.37 trillion, down 0.6% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin dominance has once again dropped below 50% after climbing above 51% at the end of October.\n\nThis development could hint at investors potentially renewing their interest in altcoins, with recent data by Blockchaincenter showing that 55% of the top 50 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 30 days.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "title": "Once a Sam Bankman-Fried favorite, Solana has 'moved beyond the FTX overhang' and gained more than 300% this ... - Fortune",
        "content": "A guilty verdict last week for Sam Bankman-Fried could prove additional good news for holders of a token long linked to the former FTX CEO that\u2019s already up more than 300% in 2023.\n\nThe Solana blockchain, and its native token SOL, was created in 2020 as a faster, cheaper alternative to Ethereum. Bankman-Fried was once a major backer of Solana and called SOL the \u201cmost underrated\u201d token. At its peak in 2021, the cryptocurrency was worth as much as $260, but while SBF\u2019s support was once a boon for the token, it later weighed it down.\n\nIn the days leading up to FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, Solana\u2019s price plummeted by more than 60%. And by the time Bankman-Fried was arrested and extradited to the U.S., the coin was trading at about $10, down 94% compared with its price at the start of 2022.\n\nYet, despite a short-term setback after the token was mentioned frequently during Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial in early October, Solana has mostly been trending upward. The coin is up 20% over the past seven days, and, since January, its price has increased 340%, according to CoinGecko. As of Tuesday afternoon, it was approaching $44.\n\nThe increase is a welcome reprieve for organizations that support the Solana network, including Solana Labs, which builds products and tools for the ecosystem. The company tried to distance itself from SBF following FTX\u2019s collapse, with cofounder Raj Gokal telling Fortune in May that the FTX meltdown was \u201cpretty far in the rearview mirror\u201d.\n\nSince then, several developments have helped increase investor optimism for the token and its underlying network. The most recent is last week\u2019s announcement of the launch of Firedancer, a validator client on Solana\u2019s testnet meant to increase the network\u2019s throughput substantially.\n\nSolana\u2019s planned upgrades, along with far fewer downtime incidents compared with last year, also have convinced some analysts of its growing potential.\n\nMatthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at the ETF and mutual fund manager VanEck, said Solana is undervalued and could be the first blockchain to host an application with 100 million users.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say they\u2019ve moved beyond the FTX overhang,\u201d Sigel said.\n\nSolana has also seen positive signs from investors in digital assets, who poured in about $35 million over the past two weeks, according to CoinShares. And in an October CoinShares survey of 58 investors who cover more than $500 billion of assets under management, Solana ranked third behind Bitcoin and Ether among digital assets with the most compelling growth outlook.\n\nStill, other analysts like 3iQ head of research Mark Connors are doubtful the planned upgrades are the main reason behind Solana\u2019s recent comeback. Connors pointed out that the large expected sale of SOL from FTX\u2019s portfolio never materialized, which may have accounted for the token\u2019s large inflows in October. Some credit may also be due to Solana\u2019s fanbase.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Ethereum slayer\u2019 has a large and loyal constituency,\u201d Connors said in an email. \u201cSo no bad news paired with a largely oversold SOL in 2022 makes it reasonable to expect some overshoot vs. other [altcoins] in 2023.\u201d"

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana is once again the talk of crypto, and its native coin SOL is benefiting from the attention. The price of SOL is up over 9% today, hitting a 24-hour high of $44.41.\n\nOver the past 30 days, it has exploded in value by over 88%, according to CoinGecko\u2014making it the biggest winner of all the major cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd despite its association with the collapsed FTX crypto exchange and its criminally convicted founder Sam Bankman-Fried, experts say Solana\u2019s recent rise shouldn\u2019t come as a shock.\n\nWidely considered a competitor to Ethereum, Solana aims to be the go-to network for on-chain applications and experiences. Ethereum proponents argue that the leading smart contract network offers greater stability and security, but Solana is objectively cheaper and faster for those wanting to build or use lending protocols, games, and other applications that utilize blockchain technology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolana gas fees right now stand at $0.000522; to make a transaction on Ethereum, it costs $6.58 on average.\n\nFor this reason, Solana has grabbed the attention of Visa, Shopify, and developers wanting to build on the network.\n\n\u201cSolana adopts a streamlined approach, emphasizing high base layer throughput while simplifying the developer experience,\u201d portfolio manager at Yield App Akash Mahendra told Decrypt, highlighting how much data can be processed by the blockchain.\n\nMahendra added that major partnerships and institutional interest are also helping drive up the price of SOL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that Solana was getting a bad rep. FTX, once one of the biggest and most recognizable brands in the crypto space, was heavily invested in Solana.\n\nEx-FTX boss and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a prominent Solana supporter, and the company invested in numerous Solana-related projects. FTX launched a marketplace for Solana NFTs, and even co-created Serum, which at one point was considered a foundation of the Solana DeFi space. At its peak in 2021, Solana commanded a market cap of $78 billion and boasted a $10 billion DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFTX then collapsed in a highly publicized bankruptcy while holding over $1 billion in SOL. The cryptocurrency plunged as a result.\n\nBut big players still see real value in the project.\n\nIn August, Solana\u2019s payment protocol Solana Pay integrated with the e-commerce platform Shopify, allowing merchants to accept stablecoin USDC via the blockchain. This collaboration \u201ccapitalized on Shopify\u2019s influential 10% share in the U.S. online retail sector, which translates to an estimated $444 billion in global transactions,\u201d according to Mahendra.\n\nThen, payments giant Visa announced in September that it had chosen Solana\u2019s blockchain for its stablecoin ambitions. This, according to Solana Foundation\u2019s head of strategy Austin Federa, \u201cvalidates the importance of the network\u2019s unmatched speed and scalability.\u201d\n\nThese two moves were seen as bullish by investors who have since been plugging fresh cash into the project. And things really picked up in the last month.\n\nPatrick Felder, founder & CIO at Prismatic Capital, told Decrypt this was because when Bitcoin and the broader crypto market started rallying, SOL was the most deeply oversold asset in the space following news that FTX\u2019s new management might sell off large amounts of SOL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut this, according to Felder, was \u201cmassively overblown\u201d FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and \u201ctriggered a massive short squeeze.\u201d In the world of trading, a short squeeze is when the price of an asset shoots up unexpectedly due to short sellers (those who\u2019ve bet on the asset going down) exiting their positions.\n\nThis happened with SOL, according to Felder, as many had bet on Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX trial hurting the asset's price.\n\nThe Solana community\u2019s annual conference, Breakpoint, took place at the end of October, leading to an even bigger rally, added Felder.\n\nThe irony is that at Breakpoint last year, the price of SOL had plunged by 60% in the week following the FTX crash. Spirits were low. But now, the coin has made a stunning comeback.\n\nAs always the question is, will it last?\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."
