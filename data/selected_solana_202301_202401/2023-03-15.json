        "content": "Solana Beach Registered Investment Advisory (RIA) firm Laurel Wealth Advisors, with $2.25 billion in assets under management, has been acquired by hybrid RIA Integrated Partners, which is based in Boston.\n\nThe deal nearly doubles Integrated Partners\u2019 AUA (assets under advisory) from $8B in 2019 to $15 billion today. The Laurel Wealth acquisition marks the Massachusetts\u2019 financial planning and investment advisory firm\u2019s bold entrance into the M&A arena.\n\nLaurel Wealth Advisors was founded in 2011 by finance experts Lee Tripodi and Mark Welsh and has since grown into a team of 32 advisors. Per the firm\u2019s website, Tripodi lives in La Jolla and was previously Senior Vice President, Executive Director and Complex Manager for UBS Financial Services in La Jolla where revenues more than tripled under his leadership.\n\nWelsh lives in Fallbrook and was previously a branch manager for UBS Financial Services in San Diego and divisional administrative manager for Houston\u2019s Shearson Lehman Brothers. He was also Director of Branch Administration and Senior Vice President for New York City\u2019s Smith Barney Shearson where he was responsible for operations at 365 national offices.\n\nValuing Entrepreneurial Spirit\n\n\u201cAs we began conducting due diligence to identify potential partners, we were determined to identify a firm that would value our ethos and entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d Tripodi said of the deal. \u201cIt quickly became clear that Integrated\u2019s significant track record of accelerating advisors\u2019 organic growth would provide an immediate lift, while enabling us to preserve the special culture we have built here at Laurel. We\u2019re excited to embark upon this new journey with them, and with our clients.\u201d\n\nIntegrated Partners\u2019 President and Founder Paul Saganey stated, \u201cIt was apparent almost immediately that the team at Laurel was a strong fit for us and vice versa.\u201d\n\nSaganey said Integrated found Laurel to be a strong fit because of the firm\u2019s holistic planning focus, cultural alignment and prior broker-dealer experience.\n\nThis is Integrated Partners first acquisition since it launched in 1996, The deal will expand its reach into the California market. The firm\u2019s website states it handles $12B in advisory and brokerage assets and has more than 200 financial advisors operating 60 nationwide offices with 165 CPA partners.\n\nNew Dimension in Growth Strategy\n\n\u201cThis partnership represents a new dimension of Integrated\u2019s growth strategy, and we could not be more proud to share this important milestone with this exceptional advisory firm,\u201d Saganey said.\n\nIntegrated Partners Chief Growth Officer Rob Sandrew added, \u201cAt Integrated, we\u2019re known for our flexibility and willingness to work with advisory teams in a non-disruptive nature across all channels of the market. Our model has now been bolstered by the ability to outright acquire firms with which we closely align. We will continue to be deliberate in our recruiting efforts so we can help firms accelerate their growth while maintaining the qualities that make them unique.\u201d\n\nIntegrated has been named the fastest-growing RIA in the country by SmartAsset for the last two years and by Citywire RIA as one of the top-growing firms in Massachusetts for two years running.\n\nLaurel Wealth Advisors\n\nCO-FOUNDERS: Lee Tripodi and Mark Welsh\n\nFOUNDED: 2011\n\nHEADQUARTERS: Solana Beach\n\nBUSINESS: Wealth advisory\n\nEMPLOYEES: 32\n\nWEBSITE: laurelwa.com\n\nCONTACT: INFO@LAURELWA.COM\n\nNOTABLE: California-based independent advisory firm known for its holistic planning approach."

        "content": "Buoyant sentiments continued to prevail in the crypto market as Bitcoin and other tokens extended their gains for the straight third day. However, the gains were capped and some tokens saw some profit booking during the early trading hours in Asia.\n\nTraders expect that the worst is over for the digital token market after the global fallout triggered by the American banking sector. Coupled with this, the US inflation numbers were in-line with the expectation, hinting that aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed are likely to be scrapped.\n\nBitcoin briefly topped the $26,000 market before giving up some gains. The largest crypto token was last seen below $25,000 level. Its largest peer Ethereum also attempted to top $1,800 but was barely holding the $1,700 mark at the time of writing this report. Altcoins outperformed the blue-chip tokens a few rose up to 35 per cent.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest crypto asset surged by over 12 per cent in the last one week. The UK government bailing out the Silicon Valley Bank has created a positive sentiment within the investment community and which may have increased buying activity, said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin.\n\n\n\n\"As per the latest data, US consumer inflation has slowed down but it's still on the higher side which may drive the Fed to continue its hawkish stance. If the macroeconomic factors continue to remain favorable then we may see Bitcoin testing $30,000 level very soon,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged stablecoins and Tron, all other popular crypto tokens extended their gains on Wednesday. Avalanche surged about 6 per cent, whereas Litecoin gained 5 per cent. Dogecoin, Solana and Polkadot were up 4 per cent, each.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher at $1.10 trillion, after rising more than 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 13 per cent close to $102.40 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin reached its highest point in nine months by surging above the $26,000 level. This was due to some encouraging inflation data and the banking sector's continued recovery from a near-catastrophic situation, said Edul Patel, CEO and Co-Founder of Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Although Bitcoin later gave up some of its gains, it remains up by 81 per cent from its lowest cycle. Ethereum has also been experiencing an upward trend, surpassing a crucial resistance level of $1,700. The current positive developments in the market indicate an overall bullish sentiment,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View By Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nOn the back of US CPI numbers pinning inflation at expected 6 per cent, Bitcoin (BTC) broke through the $26,000 level and was up by about a strong 30 per cent in the last 2 days. This is BTC\u2019s highest since June 2022. The fact that BTC has only one strong near-term resistance in its golden pocket at $25,959 should further give merit to its bullishness\n\nBut it has shed its gains and is trading below $25,000 again. Thus, despite a continuation of a bullish market structure with higher highs and higher lows, its bullish scenario of targeting the next resistance at $28,790 should be on pause for now.\n\nBTC\u2019s 50-day and 200-day moving averages (at $22,944 and $19,716, respectively,) coupled with its RSI of around 80 indicate that it might be overbought. BTC might end up falling down to its next support at $23,965 before its next attempt at a higher move.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels\n\nResistance: $25,960, $26,670, $28,800\n\nSupport: $23,965, $21,970, $19,500\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Solana Name Service (SNS) is a decentralized domain name service that allows users to create their own \u201c.sol\u201d domains. Launched in June 2021 Solana Name Service is an affordable and easy-to-use alternative to the Ethereum Name Service, which allows users to acquire \u201c.eth\u201d domains.\n\nSolana Name Service is useful as it provides a decentralized, censorship-resistant, fast, and scalable way to register and manage domains on the Solana network. In addition, SNS domains can be easily integrated with other Solana-based services, including wallets, NFT platforms, and dApps.\n\nFor the creation of your unique \u201c.sol\u201d domain, you will only need a Solana wallet, around $20 worth of USDC, and a few minutes of your time.\n\nIn this article, we will explain the ins and outs of Solana Name Service in greater detail and teach you how to register your own .sol domain through a short step-by-step guide. We will proceed by listing the benefits of using Solana domains and then wrap up the article by pointing you to other Solana resources.\n\nWhat is Solana Name Service?\n\nSolana Name Service (SNS) is a decentralized naming system that allows users to register human-readable names that can be associated with Solana wallet addresses or other on-chain data.\n\nSNS works in a similar way as the Domain Name System (DNS), which is the key domain system used for the internet, but with some unique features specific to Solana. By allowing users to create domains such as \u201ccoincodex.sol\u201d or \u201cjohndoe.sol\u201d and to associate them with their wallets, for example, SNS is making the Solana ecosystem a more convenient and user-friendly space.\n\nIn fact, long wallet addresses that are difficult to read and very easy to mistype have been identified as an important factor that is hindering cryptocurrency adoption. Hence by making Solana's environment less complex, the SNS could actually boost Solana adoption among less tech-savvy users and contribute to SOL being a good long-term investment.\n\nAs the name suggests, the SNS is built on top of Solana blockchain, which is associated with low gas fees, impressive scalability, and industry-leading TPS. In addition, Solana (and thereby also SNS) is governed by a decentralized community, making the service less prone to censorship and other single points of failure.\n\nHow to create .sol domain using Solana Name Service? A step-by-step guide\n\nCreating a .sol domain through SNS is as easy as following a couple of easy steps. We\u2019ll outline what you need to do to get your own .sol domain in the following sections.\n\n1. Go to the Bonfida SNS homepage\n\nTo begin creating a Solana-based domain, you need to go to /naming.bonfida.org or simply search for \u201cSolana Name Service\u201d in your favorite search engine.\n\n2. Connect your cryptocurrency wallet\n\nContinue by clicking the \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d button in the top right corner of the website. The website should automatically detect available wallets. Continue to input your password and thus authorize the SNS to interact with your wallet.\n\n3. Find your desired .sol domain\n\nYou can search for domains through the search bar that appears on the homepage.\n\nBonfida Solana Name Service homepage with the .sol domain search tool. (Image source: Bonfida)\n\nFor the purpose of this guide, we have selected a domain that is still free. In an optimal scenario, you will find out that your desired domain has not been claimed by another user yet. In case the domain of your choice has already been claimed, you can either immediately buy it from the current owner (only available if the owner has put the domain on sale) or make an offer to the owner of the domain.\n\nIn the latter case, you will have to wait until the owner decides to either accept or reject your offer. While the process takes a bit more time, it allows you to make an offer on any of the already claimed domains, even those not currently on sale.\n\n4. Add your domain to the cart\n\nOnce you find a domain that you like and is available for purchase, click on the \u201cAdd to cart\u201d button. Click \u201cContinue to cart\u201d to view items in your cart.\n\nYou can add more domains to your cart, as one can have an infinite number of domains registered to one wallet address.\n\n5. Select account size\n\nYou should now be able to see the domain in your cart and underneath it will write \u201cStorage 1kB'' with an \u201cEdit\u201d next to it. Clicking on \u201cEdit\u201d allows you to increase the maximum amount of data you can store on your domain up to 10kB. While 1kB is enough for most non-advanced users, make sure to do your research now as you will not be able to increase the data limit afterward.\n\nIn general, 10kB is suggested for advanced users who have a specific advanced use case in mind (such as IPFS website hosting, for example). Beware that increasing the size will slightly increase the costs of registration and could even incur rent in the future.\n\n6. Checkout and complete your purchase\n\nCurrently, the price to purchase an unclaimed Solana domain is 20 USDC plus gas cost paid in SOL, which at the time of writing accounts for 0.008 SOL for the 1kB domain. In case you do not hold enough of these cryptocurrencies in your wallet, you should transfer crypto, conduct a token swap, or buy it with fiat.\n\nThe option to pay for the domain using other coins and tokens under \"Choose token to pay with\" is going to be made available soon. Review your order for the last time and click \"Complete Purchase\" to initiate a wallet transaction.\n\nCongratulations, you are now an owner of your own Solana domain, and you should be able to see your address listed as the owner on the Bonfida webpage. In addition, you should be able to see the domain on the Solana Explorer when searching for your wallet address and clicking on the tab \u201cDomains\u201d \u2013 you can also use Solscan or any other top Solana explorers.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using .sol domains?\n\nThere are numerous benefits of using .sol domains \u2013 we are going to outline the most important ones in the following sections.\n\nNo need to remember complex blockchain addresses\n\nThe biggest advantage of using a .sol domain is that a domain is usually significantly more memorable and intuitive to use than the string of 32 to 44 characters that you are currently using to identify your Solana wallet. This allows your friends, business partners, and others to send transactions, NFTs, or smart contracts your way much faster and with more reliability.\n\nFurthermore, using a Solana domain as a Solana wallet identification is just one of the possible use cases. A domain can also point to other types of data, such as IPFS websites, images, text, and more.\n\nImproved resistance to censorship\n\nDecentralized and on-chain managed domains such as those on Solana are also much tougher to censor, which gives dApps a simple way to eliminate one of their most common single points of failure \u2013 their centralized and easily censorable domain. If Solana domains become supported by crucial domain registrars, a company (or an individual) that would use a domain ending with .sol will stand out among its competition.\n\nInexpensive to register\n\nPerhaps also because Solana Domain Service is not recognized by most internet domain registrars yet, the entry price is currently very low \u2013 in fact, it is as low as $20. Nevertheless, this does not limit the usability of Solana domains inside the cryptocurrency sphere, let alone the Solana ecosystem, where these domains are natively supported.\n\nA wide range of avalaiable domain names\n\nAlthough some of the shortest and most popular domains have already been purchased, there is still an abundance of Solana domains left to be claimed. This comes in stark contracts to .com, .net, and other traditional domains, making it very difficult to register a new domain name that's unique or easy to remember.\n\nThe bottom line: Solana Name Service streamlines blockchain transactions\n\nTo conclude, Solana Name Service provides an affordable and easy-to-use solution to mapping on-chain data using \u201c.sol\u201d domain names. Creating a domain is as easy as following six simple steps in our how-to guide above.\n\nTo create or buy a domain, you will need a compatible cryptocurrency wallet, so this might be a good time to check the list of the best Solana wallets. For those who want to try out Solana on the testnet before dipping their toes in Solana\u2019s mainnet applications, Solana faucets are a great starting point. In addition, you can check the pros and cons of investing in Solana if you are thinking about investing in the digital currency."

This allows your friends, business partners, and others to send transactions, NFTs, or smart contracts your way much faster and with more reliability.\n\nFurthermore, using a Solana domain as a Solana wallet identification is just one of the possible use cases. A domain can also point to other types of data, such as IPFS websites, images, text, and more.\n\nImproved resistance to censorship\n\nDecentralized and on-chain managed domains such as those on Solana are also much tougher to censor, which gives dApps a simple way to eliminate one of their most common single points of failure \u2013 their centralized and easily censorable domain. If Solana domains become supported by crucial domain registrars, a company (or an individual) that would use a domain ending with .sol will stand out among its competition.\n\nInexpensive to register\n\nPerhaps also because Solana Domain Service is not recognized by most internet domain registrars yet, the entry price is currently very low \u2013 in fact, it is as low as $20. Nevertheless, this does not limit the usability of Solana domains inside the cryptocurrency sphere, let alone the Solana ecosystem, where these domains are natively supported.\n\nA wide range of avalaiable domain names\n\nAlthough some of the shortest and most popular domains have already been purchased, there is still an abundance of Solana domains left to be claimed. This comes in stark contracts to .com, .net, and other traditional domains, making it very difficult to register a new domain name that's unique or easy to remember.\n\nThe bottom line: Solana Name Service streamlines blockchain transactions\n\nTo conclude, Solana Name Service provides an affordable and easy-to-use solution to mapping on-chain data using \u201c.sol\u201d domain names. Creating a domain is as easy as following six simple steps in our how-to guide above.\n\nTo create or buy a domain, you will need a compatible cryptocurrency wallet, so this might be a good time to check the list of the best Solana wallets.
