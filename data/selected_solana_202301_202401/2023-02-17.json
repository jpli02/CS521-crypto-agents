        "content": "OpenAI\u2019s text-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT has already gained worldwide recognition and popularity over its usability in multiple areas, including the cryptocurrency market, and providing insight into the future price of digital assets like Solana (SOL).\n\nTaking this into account, Finbold asked the AI chatbot to provide the possible price range for Solana by 2030 based on the network\u2019s development so far, its unique features, community strength, current market conditions, past performance, aggregated online information, and other factors.\n\nAfter admitting it was challenging to provide a definitive answer on the future price of Solana or any other cryptocurrency with certainty, ChatGPT did provide reasons for the possible rally, including the \u201cfast transaction speeds and low fees, which could make it an attractive option for developers and users alike.\u201d\n\nChatGPT says: $50 \u2013 $1,000\n\nIn terms of specific numbers, the AI tool provided possible Solana price ranges for both a bullish and a bearish scenario, with the most optimistic case projecting SOL at $1,000 or more by 2030:\n\n\u201cBullish scenario: Some analysts believe that SOL has a strong potential for growth in the coming years due to its unique features, including its high speed, low fees, and strong development team. They predict that SOL could reach as high as $1,000 or more by 2030 if it continues to gain adoption and improves its technology.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, if bears are proven to be correct, ChatGPT stated that Solana could expect only a modest increase (but an increase nonetheless) of around $50 to $100 in the next seven years, citing market circumstances and competition:\n\n\u201cBearish scenario: Others believe that the current market conditions and increased competition in the crypto space could limit SOL\u2019s growth potential. In this scenario, SOL could trade within a range of $50 to $100 by 2030, based on historical price movements and market trends.\u201d\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Solana is currently trading at the price of $22.57, which represents a decline of 5.06% on its daily chart, as the digital asset is still holding on to its 10.42% gain over the previous seven days and tries to offset the 1.37% drop across the last month, as per data retrieved on February 17.\n\nSolana price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, the realization of either of the two possible scenarios offered by ChatGPT would depend on the wider crypto and macroeconomic atmosphere, as well as the developments surrounding its ecosystem, such as the launch of a new tool to prevent scams on the Solana-supported Phantom wallet.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Tami Somich celebrated the grand opening of the new Rancho Santa Fe village business Somich Design Boutique on Feb. 8. The new interior design studio and gift shop on Paseo Delicias is all about giving everyone a beautiful space to live and filling a niche for a local gift shop with a little bit of everything, from adorable baby and kids finds to stylish kitchen goods.\n\nSomich Design specializes in residential and commercial interior design, staging and remodeling. She started her interior design business two and half years ago, three years after losing her husband Nicholas to cancer at just 41 years old.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something for myself,\u201d said Somich, who had been a stay-at-home mom to children Alex and Izzy. \u201cI wanted the kids to be proud of me and show them that I could do something rather than just being at home and sad.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Somich was renovating her Fairbanks Ranch home and she kept getting a inquiries about who was behind the design. She started taking on design clients one at a time, beautifying homes in the Covenant, La Jolla and Encinitas. \u201cIt really kind of exploded,\u201d Somich said. \u201c I just pinch myself every day that people want to work with me.\u201d\n\nSomich Design Boutique displays. (Robert McKenzie)\n\nFor about a year Somich was working on the process of opening a storefront in Solana Beach\u2019s Solana Center on Lomas Santa Fe Drive, a design shop with a retail element space where people could look at the furniture and touch the materials. While she worked on opening that store, she was approached by realtors Khaki Wennstrom and Delorine Jackson, who partnered together to create D&K, a new fashion and lifestyle boutique in the heart of the Rancho Santa Fe village. Jackson had a space available to rent and wondered if Somich would be interested in taking it on as they hoped to create more retail opportunities downtown, rather than just banks and real estate offices.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a good idea\u2026it had so much potential,\u201d Somich said. \u201cI was interested in taking that risk and trying it out.\u201d\n\nShe converted a former real estate office into her boutique, bringing in her inventory of furniture and home decor, adding pendant lights and fancy fixtures\u2014 everything on display in the shop has a price tag and is for sale. As she set up shop, she saw the need to bring in more gift items\u2014now in addition to her design services, people can stop in to find a little bit of everything, a gift for any occasion.\n\nLauren Mishurda checks out the beautiful children\u2019s selection with Somich Design Boutique junior designer/retail buyer Mia Monahogios.\n\n(Robert McKenzie)\n\nWennstrom and Jackson\u2019s vision has taken shape with Plantology, a shop that offers landscape design and succulents, and Mitchell\u2019s Floor Coverings with custom rugs and hardwood, rounding out the building space near D&K and Somich Design.\n\n\u201cA lot has happened in the last few months\u2026we\u2019re trying to get something started,\u201d Somich said, adding that the more retail that opens will hopefully help fill more village storefronts with boutiques and shops.\n\nThe Somich Design logo is a butterfly, a loving nod to her husband Nicholas. Butterflies were released at his memorial and she associates the symbol of remembrance and hope with his memory. She and Nick used to love doing renovations together, purchasing houses and investing in properties and working together to create a home. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s along with me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something he would\u2019ve loved to do together.\u201d\n\nSomich has since sold her home in Fairbanks Ranch and is renting in Cardiff while looking for her next project. Store number two in Solana Beach is still in the works, going through the city permitting process and she hopes to open her doors this spring.\n\nShe is loving what she is doing now and what it means to her kids.\n\n\u201cI want them to see how much I love it, to see what happens when you put a lot of work into something,\u201d Somich said. \u201cIt\u2019s made us closer. I think that they are really proud of me and I love that I can create this lifestyle for my family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really special.\u201d\n\nThe new store is located at 6024B Paseo Delicias.

        "title": "How ordinals are helping push Bitcoin beyond $25K - Fortune",
        "content": "Despite the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s recent crackdown on crypto, Bitcoin is up, and up big: From Tuesday to Thursday, the price rose almost 14%, peaking just above $25,000, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nPinpointing exactly why the price of the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency rises and falls isn\u2019t an exact science, but reports of a recent short squeeze\u2014investors who\u2019d bet the price of Bitcoin would decrease sold holdings\u2014is one explanation for Bitcoin\u2019s sudden rally.\n\nAlso driving up Bitcoin\u2019s value are ordinals, according to a report from blockchain data company Glassnode. But what are they, and how are they contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s latest price surge?\n\nOrdinals\u2019 origins\n\nAn ordinal is essentially a non-fungible token, a digital asset most famously used to prove that only one person owns, for example, a $69 million piece of digital art sold in March 2021.\n\nNFTs are most famously used on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. The computing capabilities of these digital ledgers extend far beyond Bitcoin\u2019s, whose blockchain is primarily designed to record transactions between owners of the digital currency.\n\nHowever, in December, Casey Rodarmor, a Bitcoin engineer, designed a method to allow NFTs to exist on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, as opposed to earlier efforts to add NFTs to Bitcoin\u2019s ledger that were hosted \u201coff-chain,\u201d or not in the same database that records daily transactions. Rodarmor called these \u201cdigital artifacts\u201d ordinals.\n\nCumulative fees spent minting Ordinals approaching $1M and looking exponential.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://t.co/kD6KnYFd8f pic.twitter.com/BjvotTwnpc \u2014 Ben DiFrancesco (@BenDiFrancesco) February 16, 2023\n\nHow do ordinals work?\n\nFirst, Rodarmor invented an algorithm to create a serial number for each and every satoshi, the name for the smallest subdivision of a Bitcoin (there are 100 million satoshis per Bitcoin), based on when the satoshi was first generated.\n\nThen, he created a method for \u201cinscribing\u201d data on a satoshi, exploiting recent updates to Bitcoin\u2019s code in 2017 and 2021, which expanded the capacity for the blockchain to store data beyond transaction records.\n\n\u201cImagine the one-cent piece you have in your pocket, and I can put a piece of data on it,\u201d Daniel Peter, cofounder and CEO of CapsuleNFT, a blockchain infrastructure company that recently announced its work with ordinals, told Fortune. \u201cInstead of that being a cent, now I\u2019ve attached a picture of Benjamin Franklin to that cent.\u201d\n\nLike NFTs on other blockchains, ordinals are \u201cnon-fungible.\u201d In other words, there is a unique record on Bitcoin\u2019s ledger that says that the slight sliver of Bitcoin with, say, Benjamin Franklin\u2019s image on it belongs to one owner and one owner only.\n\nBut, as opposed to the NFTs on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, the data piggybacking on top of a satoshi is not a link to where the actual file resides (often on decentralized file storage systems). The data is stored, or \u201cinscribed,\u201d on the ordinal itself.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum and Solana also allow users to store large data files on an NFT; however, pushing this data \u201con chain,\u201d or having it reside on the blockchain itself, is more computationally intensive and therefore expensive, Jon Wong, technical lead on the NFT team at the Solana Foundation, told Fortune.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s decidedly an anti-scale model,\u201d Austin Federa, head of strategy and communications at the Solana Foundation, said of ordinals. He added: \u201cHere\u2019s a version of something that sort of, if you squint, resembles fine art, in terms of its ability to create value through scarcity.\u201d However, he noted, its uses are otherwise limited.\n\nStaying power?\n\nSince ordinals became hot in early February, the number of \u201cmints,\u201d or creations, of Bitcoin NFTs have soared, according to data from Dune Analytics. The majority of data \u201cinscribed\u201d or stored on ordinals are images, including reprints of Bored Apes illustrations and a space turtle GIF. But people have also attached other media, including a clip of amateur Spanish rap. Almost 130,000 ordinals have been minted so far, per Dune.\n\nAs ordinal mints have increased, the minters have been willing to pay the miners, the computers that run and secure Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, more and more in transaction fees. The increased frenzy is one of the reasons behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent price increase, says Wong of the Solana Foundation.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether ordinals, which are only about two months old, have staying power. But, in the meantime, Bitcoiners are cheering on the rally."
