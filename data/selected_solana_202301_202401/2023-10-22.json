        "content": "One of the most compelling reasons to believe that Solana is on track to become the best performer for 2023 is how the crypto has performed in the recent past. SOLhas leaped from $10 to $30 in the last 10 months. It has rallied 41% in the past seven days, 60% over the last month and 41% over the last six months.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSolana (SOL) has witnessed a significant double-digit price increase, outpacing Cardano (ADA) and establishing itself as a formidable contender.\n\nCurrently priced at $28.40, Solana experienced a 29.4% rise over the past seven days, while Cardano's price edged up just 4.1% to $0.25.\n\nSolana's market cap stands at nearly $11.9 billion, which puts it in eighth place by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko's rankings. Cardano, which is currently valued at $9 billion, currently stands at ninth place.\n\nIn addition, Solana's recent rally was not just limited to overshadowing Cardano. In the past week, Solana outstripped every other cryptocurrency in the top 10, including XRP, even though the latter was riding high on Ripple's recent legal victories.\n\nAsian investors driving rally\n\nAsian investors appear to be a significant force behind Solana's impressive performance, according to recent data.\n\nAsia driving a lot of the SOL bid pic.twitter.com/P97q7KPE71 \u2014 ChiefingZa (@chiefingza) October 22, 2023\n\nThe graph above shows that the APAC region (Asia-Pacific) has shown a significant upward trajectory in the cumulative returns for SOL. At the same time, the U.S. remains stable, and the EU experiences a modest rise.\n\nSolana's booming NFT market\n\nSolana's performance is not restricted to its token price alone. According to data from CryptoSlam, the blockchain reported sales of $1.43 million in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) over the past 24 hours.\n\nBy comparison, Ethereum led the pack with NFT sales of over $9.9 million, followed by Mythos Chain at around $1.39 million. Notably, Cardano lagged behind with a modest $132,929 in NFT sales."

That is still 20% higher but looking very promising in terms of high time frame structure.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems bullish on SOL/BTC after the pair printed higher-low structures while moving above a diagonal resistance. At time of writing, Solana is worth $29.44 and SOL/BTC is trading at 0.00098 BTC.\n\nBluntz is also bullish on Ethereum (ETH). According to the analyst, Ethereum may be setting up for a rally after respecting support at $1,550 and printing a bullish higher-low setup.\n\n\u201cETH/BTC has been absolutely demolished lately but ETH/USD is not only well and truly back in the range it broke down from but has also put in a higher low in the process.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is worth $1,632.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nThis week brought a positive trend in the crypto market, with Bitcoin knocking the $30K threshold. This development has sparked buyer interest in several altcoins, potentially signaling a recovery in the \u2018Uptober\u2019 movement. With the closing of October on the edge, historical patterns suggest a solid bullish week, possibly triggering a fresh round of purchases. Consequently, several altcoins, such as Ripple\u2019s XRP, Solana, and Chainlink, are poised for further gains.\n\nBitcoin Attracts Altcoin Investors\n\nWith Bitcoin price witnessing massive volatility and upswings around the psychological level of $30K, altcoins are now struggling to witness an influx of new capital. As a result, investors show less interest in altcoins.\n\nAccording to Blockchain Center, the altcoin season index is now far away from 75 as it hovers around 20. It suggests that the current sentiment is favoring Bitcoin season, with BTC prices meeting buyers\u2019 expectations. However, an aggressive purchase of altcoins next week might push the metric toward the North.\n\nXRP Price Analysis\n\nXRP price witnessed a massive upswing following Ripple\u2019s victory against the SEC. As a result, the altcoin surged above EMA lines and is now holding above EMA20. However, bears a preventing further surge as the price faces selling pressure at $0.53.\n\nCurrently, the moving averages are leveling, and the RSI hovers just above the midline, signaling buyers\u2019 comeback for the XRP within the $0.5 to $0.558 range. Should the price maintain above the moving averages, there\u2019s a chance for the price to ascend to the next resistance level at $0.558 and then to $0.668.\n\nAlternatively, a decline below the moving averages could enhance the chances of a decline to EMA200. A significant trend shift is anticipated if the price declines below $0.44.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\n\nSOL price experienced a significant surge, surging above the crucial neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) formation, validating a positive trend.\n\nThe upward momentum continues as buyers dominate with long positions, with investors aiming to send the value past a critical hurdle at $30. Achieving this could pave the way for the SOL price to surge toward the anticipated target of $33.\n\nTypically, following a breakout beyond significant resistance, there\u2019s a tendency for the price to retract and revisit the former breakout point. Here, the price might draw back to test the neckline.\n\nShould the price rebound from $24.5, it could signal the commencement of another bullish phase. Conversely, a downturn from $24 will result in the upper hand back to the bears, potentially dampening the market sentiment.\n\nChainlink (LINK) Price Analysis\n\nThe extended wick on Chainlink\u2019s candlestick highlights strong purchasing activity by the bulls within the $7.6 to $8.7 range.\n\nFor a bullish trend continuation, buyers need to hold the momentum above the current level and send the price above $9.7. Successfully doing so could pave the way for a surge toward the next barrier at $12.2.\n\nThis point is likely to see a robust battle between the bulls and the bears. However, a decline below EMA50 will plunge the altcoin toward $5.7."

        "content": "Solana price performance since the start of 2023 is 195%, beating Bitcoin\u2019s 82% and Chainlink\u2019s 70.52%.\n\nThis performance could carry forward to the next year, keeping SOL relevant and rallying higher.\n\nTechnicals suggest SOL could more than double if a few conditions are met.\n\nSolana (SOL) price suffered a major setback after the FTX exchange filed for bankruptcy. But SOL\u2019s comeback is nothing short of a miracle, considering its year-to-date returns of 195% overshadow that of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlthough the majority of crypto investors believe that Solana is a delicate asset due to the FTX proceedings, there are a few reasons which suggest otherwise.\n\nCrypto YTD Performance\n\nAlso read: Solana price turns bullish after confirming trend reversal, 20% gains incoming for SOL?\n\nSolana could outperform notable altcoins in 2024\n\nThe first reason why investors should keep an eye on Solana price is how the altcoin has outperformed major cryptos. SOL shot up from $9.97 to nearly $30 in the span of the last ten months. On October 21 alone, the Ethereum competitor yielded a 25% return, while investors were busy gawking at Chainlink\u2019s 21% rally.\n\nSo, where is this momentum coming from?\n\nContrarian thinking: Many investors are staying away from Solana due to the drama surrounding FTX and the ongoing bankruptcy lawsuit. But when a major chunk of investors believe that, then the chances of an altcoin rallying would be high. This phenomenon is precisely why local tops are formed at peak hype or retail frenzy. It is also why cycle bottoms are produced during times when investors capitulate. So, with that in mind, Solana price will continue to rally until investors believe that SOL is a touch-y coin due to the FTX proceedings.\n\nMany investors are staying away from Solana due to the drama surrounding FTX and the ongoing bankruptcy lawsuit.

SOL staking and fundamentals: While many feared that FTX Estate would sell the bankrupt exchange\u2019s holdings, it did the opposite \u2013 it staked $122 million worth of SOL and $5 million worth of ETH. This move adds to the Solana altcoin\u2019s fundamentals and prevents the sell-off, at least for some time.

SOL to ETH Ratio: Despite Solana price being in a worse state than Ethereum after the FTX crash, the SOL to ETH ratio has risen to 0.06, a level last seen almost a year ago. This strength seen in Solana price shows another shift in paradigm in investors losing interest in Ethereum.\n\nSOL/ETH 1-day chart\n\nInstitutional investors choose SOL: Lastly, CoinShares head of research James Butterfill noted in an October 9 report that Solana has seen massive inflows for 2022 and that it continues to \u201cassert itself as the altcoin of choice.\u201d\n\nAll in all, Solana price has been neglected by a majority of retail investors, and as long as this holds true, SOL is likely going to outperform Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and other major altcoins.\n\nAlso read: Solana vs. Ethereum: Renewed debate erupts over efficiency, development and scalability\n\nSolana price could more than double under right conditions\n\nSolana (SOL) price has overcome the $25.86 hurdle after nearly a year of struggle. The swift move above the said hurdle showcases bulls\u2019 strength. For the ongoing rally to continue, investors need to prepare for a minor pullback to $25.86 or $24.43. A bounce from this level is key to kickstarting a rally to $69.79.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Solana price breaches the key low of $21.11, it would create a lower low and invalidate the bullish thesis. In such a case, SOL could revisit $17.92."
