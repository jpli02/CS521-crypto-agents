        "content": "Rancho Santa Fe photographer Betty Byrd\u2019s new photographic exhibition \u201cWild Legacies\u201d, now on display at the Solana Beach City Hall Gallery, hopes to open people\u2019s eyes to the plight of endangered species.\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest show she\u2019s ever done, with images of her many wildlife explorations\u2014wolves, birds, elephants, a striking green-eyed panther and a large print of a leopard she photographed while on safari in Kenya last September.\n\n\n\nFor the record: The article originally stated Betty Byrd was a Carmel Valley resident but she is a longtime resident of Rancho Santa Fe.\n\n\u201c\u2018Wild Legacies represents a long journey of past actions and decisions on my part. I always felt that there was more out there to be seen and discovered. After watching a dying polar bear struggling to survive in the Arctic, river rafting through the Tortuguero jungle in Costa Rica and experiencing fatalities from the drought in Africa, I was consumed by the fact that these endangered species were in desperate need of help,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cTheir lives represent a parallel life to ours. Except think of them as doting parents, doctors and nurses for themselves, lawyers that don\u2019t have their day in court, children that have few adoption agencies. This exhibit represents wildlife that could be lost at any time and saved at any time as well.\u201d\n\nA special reception for the show will be held Saturday, Sept. 30 from 4-6 p.m. A portion of the proceeds from the event will go to The Sheldrick Trust Elephant Orphanage, Nairobi, Kenya, the California Wolf Center, Julian, California, San Diego Audubon Society and International Fund for Animal Welfare.\n\nThe show features 17 of Byrd\u2019s photos, in the hallways and some up the stairs. Some are older pieces from trips to places like Bostwana but many are from her most recent trip to Kenya.\n\nThe exhibit will be on display through Oct. 24 at Solana Beach City Hall at 635 South Highway 101. The gallery hosts a new artist\u2019s exhibition each month and the Solana Beach Arts Commission invites artists interested in exhibiting their work in 2024 to submit proposals by Oct. 31. For more information on the program and requirements, contact Kayla Moshki at (858) 720-2438 or kmoshki@cosb.org\n\nFor more on Betty Byrd\u2019s photography, visit byrdseyeviewphotos.com"

        "title": "Raoul Pal's Bullish Outlook on Solana: A Strong Ethereum Competitor - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "In a recent interview with Altcoin Daily, Raoul Pal, the founder of Real Vision and a former Goldman Sachs executive, expressed his bullish stance on Solana (SOL), describing it as one of the most promising projects outside of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAccording to a report by The Daily Hodl, Pal praised Solana\u2019s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and highlighted the blockchain\u2019s growing developer community and public awareness. Pal says Anatoly Yakovenko \u2014 commonly known as Toly \u2014 is emerging as an important thought leader in the cryptocurrency space. Pal appreciates Yakovenko\u2019s open-minded approach, stating that he builds bridges rather than destroying them. Yakovenko\u2019s leadership style, Pal believes, positively represents the Solana ecosystem.\n\nPal is impressed by Solana\u2019s engaged developer community and the passion they have for building the ecosystem and its technology. He also noted that Solana has gained significant public awareness, which is a crucial factor for its growth and adoption.\n\nOn September 5, Visa (NYSE: V) announced that it was \u201cexpanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain.\u201d\n\nCuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto at Visa, had this to say:\n\n\u201cBy leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we\u2019re helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa\u2019s treasury. Visa is committed to being on the forefront of digital currency and blockchain innovation and leveraging these new technologies to help improve the way we move money.\u201d\n\nPal said:\n\n\u201cSo, why is Visa using Solana? Because it\u2019s fast. It\u2019s fast, and it does a good job \u2026 It\u2019s not Ethereum. It\u2019s different from Ethereum and even the way Toly has been talking about, \u2018Could SOL be a layer-2 on ETH?,\u2019 or \u2018How do these worlds integrate?\u2019 It just shows that for Visa to make a wrong decision is not that easy because things can be bridged, things can be interoperable \u2026\u201d\n\nPal believes that if digital assets are set for another market expansion in the coming years, Solana could be one of the safest bets. He sees Solana as a blockchain that has not made any significant mistakes for a long time, especially when the crypto space was going through periods of \u201cmaximum fear and hate.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging Ethereum\u2019s position as the \u201cbig daddy\u201d of the crypto space, Pal sees Solana as the next best major story. He suggests that when looking for an altcoin that offers relative security, Solana stands out as a strong contender, making it a less risky choice compared to other options."

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCoinbase-incubated Base has overtaken Solana to become the ninth-largest blockchain by total value locked (TVL).\n\nAccording to DeFiLlama data, DeFi protocols on Base have amassed deposits totaling $370.50 million, in contrast to Solana's $310.25 million.\n\nAmong Ethereum layer-2 protocols, Base currently stands as the third-largest network in terms of the value bridged across its network, ranking behind only Arbitrum and Optimism, according to L2Beat.\n\nBase is also the most active network compared to both Ethereum and rival layer-2 networks, with daily average transactions per second (TPS) of 15.15, while Ethereum and layer-2s lag behind at 11 TPS or lower, L2beat data shows.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFriend.tech leads activity on Base\n\nBase\u2019s recent growth can be attributed to heightened activity on Web3 social media platform Friend.tech, as well as the recent addition of reputable DeFi applications to the blockchain over the past few weeks.\n\nBase\u2019s DeFi deposits surpassed $300 million for the first time after the launch of Aerodrome DEX as users rushed to farm the early liquidity mining incentives.\n\nBesides Aerodrome DEX, the expansion of popular Ethereum DeFi protocols to Base, including lending platform Compound Finance, decentralized exchange Uniswap, and cross-chain bridging protocol Stargate, also contributed to the spike in DeFi deposits.\n\nOver the last two weeks, Friend.tech has led the surge in Base deposits and activity. It currently holds the number two spot in terms of DeFi deposits and number one spot concerning activity and revenues on Base, per DeFiLlama data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFriend.tech is a social media platform with tokenized accounts. Only users who own the Keys of specific accounts get access to private chat groups on the platform.\n\nThe number of Friend.tech Keys purchased and sold has increased since September 9, reaching a new peak of 539,810 transactions on September 13, according to data from Dune dashboard analyst CryptoKoryo.\n\nDaily count of Friend.tech transactions. Source: Dune\n\nAdditionally, over $130 million has been deposited into the application since September 9, as the number of deposits more than doubled from just over $100 million to $230 million presently.\n\nThe platform had a tremendous start in August. However, it gradually declined due to concerns about the application's privacy policies and the steep bonding curve, which resulted in significantly higher costs for account keys as their popularity increased.\n\nStill, activity on the platform has surged due to airdrop speculation, as early users hope to receive governance tokens for the platform.\n\nFriend.tech also enables sharing of trading fees as royalties for shareholders; the only way to earn from the platform is through royalty fees. Users who own Keys of accounts receive royalty fees everytime a key is traded, which is likely fueling the purchases of Twitter accounts by the account holders themselves and other speculators."

        "content": "Is Solana a Good Investment in the Crypto Market?\n\n\u200dWith the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, investors are constantly seeking opportunities to maximize their returns.\n\nSolana (SOL) has emerged as one of the most promising projects in the crypto market, known for its scalability, speed, and low transaction fees.\n\nIn this article, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine whether Solana is a good investment option for both short-term and long-term investors.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin: South Korean Lender Delio Plans To Sue Authorities\n\nUnderstanding Solana and its Potential\n\nSolana is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a fast and efficient infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets.\n\nIt differentiates itself through its unique consensus mechanism, Proof of History (PoH), which enables the network to process thousands of transactions per second.\n\nWith its high throughput and low fees, Solana has gained significant attention and has become a popular choice for developers and users.\n\nThe Advantages of Solana\n\nScalability: Solana\u2019s architecture allows for horizontal scaling, meaning that as the network grows, it can handle increasing transactions without compromising its performance.\n\n\n\nThis scalability is crucial for the widespread adoption of decentralized applications and the growth of the Solana ecosystem. Fast Transaction Speeds: Solana\u2019s PoH consensus mechanism ensures fast transaction confirmation times.\n\n\n\nWith an average block time of 400 milliseconds, Solana can process transactions at lightning speed, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the market. Low Transaction Fees: Solana\u2019s low transaction fees make it an attractive option for users and developers. As the network grows, the fees will remain low due to its scalable infrastructure. Support for Smart Contracts: Solana is compatible with Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to port their existing Ethereum-based projects onto the Solana blockchain.\n\n\n\nThis interoperability allows developers to leverage Solana\u2019s speed and scalability while retaining compatibility with Ethereum tools and infrastructure.\n\nSolana\u2019s Market Performance\n\nSource: Outlook India\n\nLike any investment, it is essential to assess the historical performance of Solana to make informed decisions.\n\nSolana experienced a significant decline in value following the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in November 2022. However, it has shown resilience and recovered some losses in recent months.\n\nIn November 2022, Solana\u2019s price dropped by nearly 70%, but it has since rebounded, reaching a peak of $26.93 in February 2023. This recovery demonstrates the potential for Solana to regain and surpass its previous all-time high.\n\nSolana Sol Price Predictions: Expert Opinions\n\nTo gain further insights into Solana\u2019s investment potential, let\u2019s explore some expert predictions for Solana\u2019s price trajectory in the coming years.\n\nShort-Term Price Predictions\n\nShort-term predictions for Solana vary, but many experts believe that Solana can potentially experience significant growth shortly.\n\nTechnical analysis suggests Solana\u2019s price could reach new highs if it breaks above key resistance levels.\n\nAccording to some analysts, if Solana breaks above the $26 resistance zone and maintains a clear rejection of the $14 support level, it could soar to as high as $140 or even higher.\n\nThis potential upside represents a substantial return on investment for those who buy Solana at its current price levels.\n\nLong-Term Price Predictions\n\nLooking beyond the short-term, Solana\u2019s long-term price predictions are equally optimistic. Many experts believe that Solana has the potential to outperform other cryptocurrencies and become a dominant player in the market.\n\nSome industry insiders even suggest that Solana could become a sidechain for Cardano (ADA). This integration would further enhance Solana\u2019s capabilities and open up new possibilities for its adoption and usage.\n\nFactors to Consider Before Investing in Solana\n\nSource: Solana\n\nWhile Solana shows great promise, it is essential to consider certain factors before investing in the cryptocurrency. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. Market Volatility\n\nThe crypto market is highly volatile, and Solana is no exception. The price of SOL can experience significant fluctuations in a short period of time. It is crucial to clearly understand the risks associated with investing in volatile assets and be prepared to handle market downturns.\n\n2. Network Outages and Security\n\nSolana has faced network outages and technical challenges in the past. While the team behind Solana has been working diligently to address these issues, it is essential to stay updated on the network\u2019s performance and security measures to ensure the safety of your investments.\n\n3. Diversification\n\nDiversification is a critical strategy in any investment portfolio. While Solana may have strong growth potential, spreading your investments across multiple assets is advisable to mitigate risk and maximize returns.\n\n4. Conducting Due Diligence\n\nBefore investing in Solana or any other cryptocurrency, conducting thorough research and due diligence is crucial. Stay informed about the latest developments, news, and regulatory changes that may impact the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nHow to Buy Solana (SOL)\n\nIf you\u2019ve decided to invest in Solana, here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to buy SOL tokens:\n\nChoose a Reliable Exchange: Select a reputable cryptocurrency exchange that supports Solana. Some popular exchanges where you can buy SOL include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Create an Account: Sign up for an account on your chosen exchange. Complete the necessary verification processes to ensure compliance with the exchange\u2019s regulations. Deposit Funds: Deposit funds into your exchange account. Most exchanges accept deposits in fiat currencies such as USD or EUR. Alternatively, you can deposit other cryptocurrencies and trade them for SOL. Place an Order: Navigate to the trading section of the exchange and search for SOL. Choose the trading pair that matches your desired currency (e.g., SOL/USD or SOL/BTC). Specify the amount of SOL you want to buy and place your order. Secure Your Tokens: Transfer your SOL tokens to a secure wallet after the purchase. Hardware wallets, such as Ledger or Trezor, provide an extra layer of security for your digital assets.\n\nSource: YouTube\n\nConclusion: Is Solana a Good Investment?\n\nConsidering its unique features, technological advancements, and positive price predictions, Solana presents an attractive investment opportunity in the crypto market.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to remember that investing in cryptocurrencies involves risks, and market conditions can change rapidly.\n\nBefore making any investment decisions, it is advisable to consult with a financial advisor and conduct your own research.\n\nBy staying informed and understanding the risks involved, you can make well-informed investment choices and potentially reap the rewards of investing in Solana."
