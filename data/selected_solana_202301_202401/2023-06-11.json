        "content": "US-based trading firm Robinhood announced the delisting of Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) labeled them as securities in the suits against two crypto heavyweights.\n\nThe company, which recently ventured into crypto, said the SEC\u2019s claim cast a cloud of uncertainty around these assets and, as a result, its team decided to end support for them.\n\nSEC\u2019s Pressure Intensifies\n\nRobinhood decided to end support for the three tokens on June 27th, 2023, at 6:59 PM ET. The leftover ADA, MATIC, and SOL in the user\u2019s Robinhood Crypto account after the deadline will be sold for market value.\n\nThe proceeds, on the other hand, will be credited to their Robinhood buying power. The brokerage firm also confirmed that no other coins have been affected. The official statement read,\n\n\u201cYou can continue to buy, sell and hold ADA, MATIC, and SOL until the deadline. You will be able to transfer ADA, MATIC, and SOL until June 27th, 2023. (If you live in Hawaii or Nevada, you can\u2019t buy ADA, MATIC, and SOL. If you live in New York, you can\u2019t transfer ADA, MATIC, and SOL.)\u201d\n\nThe development teams behind the three projects \u2013 Polyogn, Solana, and Cardano \u2013 have dismissed SEC\u2019s claim. Meanwhile, Robinhood\u2019s decision comes amidst the SEC\u2019s crackdown on Binance and Coinbase, which were accused of operating illegal exchanges by the agency.\n\nInefficiencies Within SEC\n\nEarlier this week, Robinhood\u2019s chief legal officer Dan Gallagher said the company was \u201cactively reviewing\u201d tokens after the agency\u2019s analysis. While testifying before the House Agriculture Committee on Tuesday, Gallagher, who previously served as a Commissioner at the SEC, said Robinhood tried to register with the agency as a special-purpose broker for digital assets and went through a 16-month process.\n\nHowever, by March, the SEC staff told Robinhood that the process was over and they \u201cwould not see any fruits of that effort.\u201d\n\nGallagher\u2019s testimony echoes Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal\u2019s complaint that the crypto exchange failed to secure a registration despite months of discussions. He blamed the SEC for dismissing the platform\u2019s attempts with no response or any counter-proposal."

        "content": "The price of tokens tied to some of the best known blockchains plummeted on Friday days after the Securities and Exchange Commission declared them to be securities in complaints filed against Coinbase and Binance. While Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced only minor dips, other well-known crypto projects took a beating.\n\nAs of Sunday evening, the price of Solana\u2019s SOL token was down nearly 30% over seven days, while Polygon\u2019s MATIC token and Cardano\u2019s ADA were down 28% and 29.5%, respectively, over the same period.\n\nWhile crypto prices slumped across the board following the SEC complaints, which dropped last Monday and Tuesday, it was only on Friday that markets experienced a massive sell-off.\n\nThe cause of Friday\u2019s plunge appears to be a decision by some of the biggest crypto market makers and trading firms to dump their holdings. A Coindesk report pointed to tweets from the analytics firm LookOnChain, which cited blockchain data to say wallets tied to Cumberland, Jump Trading and Robinhood had off-loaded a large volume of tokens to exchanges.\n\nThese firms\u2019 large holdings, combined with an illiquid trading environment following the SEC declaration, likely led to an especially steep drop in prices. Meanwhile, Robinhood on Friday announced it would delist Solana, Cardano, and Polygon from its exchange as of June 27\u2014another likely blow to their value.\n\nSolana and Cardano are so-called layer-1 blockchains, which aspire to challenge Ethereum, while Polygon is a side-chain that helps process Ethereum transactions more efficiently. While they took the biggest price hit, other well-known blockchains also experienced a big blow in the wake of the SEC complaints.\n\nThe seven-day price for tokens tied Filecoin and Internet Computer\u2014both of which were also labelled as securities by the SEC\u2014were down 26% and 24%, respectively, on Sunday. Meanwhile, a number of well-known older projects, notably Litecoin and Dogecoin, were not labelled as securities and have fallen by around 15%.\n\nThe crypto industry has long decried what it claims has been a lack of guidance from the SEC when it comes to determining which blockchain tokens are securities. The issue is the subject of a closely watched legal battle between the agency and Ripple, which is associated to the XRP token. A decision is expected as soon as this summer.\n\nBitcoin, which is down 4% over the past week, is the only token that the SEC has stated not to be a security. Ethereum, whose legal status is unclear, is down 7%. The two tokens are by far the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap."

        "title": "Shifting Crypto Landscape: DOT Declines While SOL and COLT Rise - Euro Weekly News",
        "content": "By Guest Writer \u2022 Published: 11 Jun 2023 \u2022 9:45\n\nIn recent weeks, the crypto landscape has witnessed a significant shift in investor sentiment, leading to the rise of alternative cryptocurrencies. Polkadot (DOT) has experienced a decline in its market position, while Solana (SOL) and Collateral Network (COLT) have emerged as potential contenders. Which is the better choice? Find out here!\n\nUnraveling the Price Slide of Polkadot in the Crypto Market\n\nPolkadot has been experiencing challenges in the last month, with its price declining by 6.76%. Its price chart analysis shows that the price of Polkadot has crossed below the MA curve. This crossing is generally interpreted as a bearish signal in the market, suggesting a potential downward trend for DOT.\n\nHowever, the Polkadot (DOT) price attempts to break through the MA band, indicating a possible reversal in the prevailing market trend.\n\nStarting the day at $5.22, the bearish trend has gradually transformed into a more optimistic outlook for Polkadot. As a result, the price rose to around $5.53 and returned to $5.2, acting as a resistance level.\n\nDOT is trading at $5.24 at the time of writing, reflecting a 0.15% increase over the past 24 hours. Over the past few hours, the price of Polkadot has surpassed the resistance at $5.20, indicating the bullish strength of the market.\n\nThe bulls aim to break through the next resistance level of Polkadot at $5.30. However, it\u2019s crucial to monitor the market closely as bears may attempt to regain control, potentially leading to a fallback and a test of the $5.18 support level for Polkadot.\n\nAnalysing the Price Soar of Solana in the Crypto Market\n\nAs of today, the price of Solana stands at $21.07, showcasing a 1.65% increase over the past 24 hours. This surge has propelled Solana to secure the #9 ranking on CoinMarketCap, with a live market cap of $8,343,924,442. With a circulating supply of 394,890,490 SOL coins, bullish momentum for Solana has caught the attention of investors worldwide.\n\nA closer look at the Solana (SOL) price analysis reveals a firm uptrend in recent days. Solana faces resistance at the $20.97 level, a critical barrier that the bulls are determined to overcome. Should the buying pressure persist, this resistance could easily be broken, paving the way for further price gains for Solana holders.\n\nOn the downside, the support level for the Solana is situated around $20.46, indicating a strong foundation to withstand potential corrections.\n\nCollateral Network: Unlocking Liquidity through Fractional Lending\n\nIn the world of decentralised finance (DeFi), Collateral Network is emerging as a disruptive force, poised to experience a significant surge in value. With its innovative approach and growing demand for DeFi applications, Collateral Network offers a groundbreaking solution that allows individuals to unlock liquidity using their valuable assets.\n\nCollateral Network revolutionises asset liquidity by allowing owners to leverage valuable assets as collateral. Imagine owning a high-quality wine collection worth $50,000. Traditionally, this collection would sit idle, offering no immediate financial benefits.\n\nBut with Collateral Network, the wine collection can be minted into NFTs which will then be fractionalized, enabling investors to lend smaller amounts and earn weekly interest. Borrowers repay the loan and interest, unlocking liquidity from their assets efficiently and securely.\n\nCurrently, Collateral Network (COLT) is in its public presale, with the token trading at $0.014. This marks a 40% increase from its initial price of $0.01. Industry experts predict that Collateral Network has the potential to reach $0.35. Such growth would translate to a remarkable 35x gain for token holders. Moreover, once Collateral Network hits major exchanges, its value is anticipated to surge by a staggering 100x.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nSponsored\n\nWARNING: The investment in crypto assets is not regulated, it may not be suitable for retail investors and the total amount invested could be lost\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE: La inversi\u00f3n en criptoactivos no est\u00e1 regulada, puede no ser adecuada para inversores minoristas y perderse la totalidad del importe invertido"

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe organizations behind several popular cryptocurrencies have spoken out against recent claims made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2014which argued that Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Cardano (ADA) are securities.\n\nThe SEC named the three among a slew of other tokens as examples of securities being offered and traded on allegedly non-compliant crypto exchanges as part of its lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase last week.\n\nSolana, Polygon, and Cardano are among the lawsuits\u2019 most recognizable tokens, placing within the industry\u2019s top 20 by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. Combined, the three tokens have a market capitalization of over $21 billion\u2014equal to around one-tenth of Ethereum\u2019s total value.\n\nOver the past seven days, the trio of tokens have tumbled around 30% each, according to CoinGecko. Yet, as of this writing, they staged a partial comeback on Sunday\u2014paring back a small portion of losses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong the big three altcoins, Cardano was the first to have its regulatory status defended by a founding organization. On June 6, the blockchain research and engineering firm that created Cardano, Input Output Global (IOG), said ADA has never been a security under U.S. securities law.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s latest lawsuits will not impact the company\u2019s operations \u201cin any way,\u201d IOG said, adding that the firm welcomes a collaborative approach with regulators that would preserve the possibility of innovation while protecting consumers.\n\n\u201cThis latest filing from the SEC demonstrates that we still have a long way to go,\u201d IOG added. \u201cRegulation through enforcement action does not provide either the clarity or certainty to which both the blockchain industry and consumers are entitled.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the Solana Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to Solana and based in Switzerland, delivered a similar message\u2014albeit with less conviction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInstead of outright asserting that Solana isn\u2019t a security, the Solana Foundation said on Twitter it \u201cdisagrees with the characterization of SOL as a security.\u201d\n\nThe organization underscored its commitment to working with regulators in the statement, similar to IOG, explaining \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d is an issue that impacts everyone in the digital assets space that\u2019s \u201cbuilding\u201d in the U.S.\n\nThe Solana Foundation disagrees with the characterization of SOL as a security. We welcome the continued engagement of policymakers as constructive partners on regulation to achieve legal clarity on these issues for the thousands of entrepreneurs across the U.S. building in the\u2026 \u2014 Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) June 10, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, members of the Solana community are debating the viability of forking Solana\u2014contemplating whether splitting off and creating a new network would be the best path forward, similar to what Ethereum did following The DAO hack in 2016.\n\nSome, such as HGE.ABC on Twitter, said it could also be a way to skirt around the potential impact of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, where a substantial amount of Solana tokens owned by Alameda Research, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s trading firm, could hit the open market over the following years.\n\n\u201c[A] community fork [of] Solana will get rid of SEC issue,\u201d HGE.ABC said. \u201c[And] no bankruptcy will dump on you for [the] next 3 years continuously.\u201d\n\nBold but not a bad idea actually. Community fork solana will get rid of sec issue. No bankruptcy will dump on you for next 3 years continuously.$ETH is a fork of $ETC and doing well. Blink twice if you agree https://t.co/fWxbkMQ4aI \u2014 HGE.ABC (@HGEABC) June 10, 2023\n\nHours after the Solana Foundation commented on the SEC\u2019s point of view, Polygon Labs chimed in on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe company behind Polygon did not say its Ethereum scaling solution\u2019s token is not a security\u2014nor did it explicitly mention the SEC. But Polygon Labs did try to distance MATIC from U.S. markets.\n\nThe company said Polygon was developed and deployed outside of the U.S., and drew attention to a \u201cglobal community that supports the network.\u201d Focusing on the coin\u2019s utility, Polygon Labs said MATIC was needed to secure its Polygon network from launch.\n\nAdditionally, Polygon Labs said it has conducted itself in a way where U.S.-based persons were not targeted\u2014possibly laying the groundwork for a legal argument over regulatory jurisdiction regarding MATIC.\n\n\u201cWe are confident in the actions we took in the past,\u201d Polygon Labs said. \u201cGiven our focus on network security, we made sure MATIC was available to a wide group of persons, but only with actions that did not target the U.S. at any time.\u201d\n\nSince the SEC\u2019s regulatory double-tap against Binance and Coinbase, the trading app Robinhood has said it will end support for Solana, Polygon, and Cardano, explaining that the lawsuits have \u201ccast a cloud of uncertainty\u201d around the cryptocurrencies in question.\n\nOther companies could potentially follow suit, but each coin\u2019s respective organization is trying its best to clear its currency\u2019s name in the meantime."
