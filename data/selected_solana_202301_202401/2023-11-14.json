        "content": "Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) has listed SOL perpetual futures on its international exchange and Coinbase Advanced. The launch occurred earlier today, November 14.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s AVAX is another major cryptocurrency to get listed on both platforms. We\u2019ll see two major trading pairs this week: SOL-PERP and AVAX-PERP.\n\n@CoinbaseIntExch will add support for Solana and Avalanche perpetual futures contracts on Coinbase International Exchange & Coinbase Advanced. The opening of our SOL-PERP and AVAX-PERP markets will begin on or around 4pm UTC on 14 November 2023, if liquidity conditions are met. pic.twitter.com/D2QTV9k9Qe \u2014 Coinbase International Exchange \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@CoinbaseIntExch) November 12, 2023\n\nIn October, Coinbase Advanced introduced perpetual futures trading, featuring contracts mainly designed for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP.\n\nThe platform allows traders to use leverage options and settle transactions in the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin; in other words, customers can use leverage to trade the above crypto perps with their profits and losses settled in USDC.\n\nWhat it Means for Solana (SOL)\n\nSolana (SOL) has seen some disproportionate gains compared to other major cryptocurrencies. The coin has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) during the latest crypto market rally, surging more than 174% over the past 30 days.\n\nAdding both SOL and AVAX perpetual futures on Coinbase will give traders more leverage to bet on the cryptocurrency price movements. It will also make Solana more accessible to institutional investors globally, who often use Coinbase as a trusted venue to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nBoth cryptocurrencies have seen tremendous price action in the last 30 days. AVAX is getting closer to $20, with nearly 50% in gains recorded over the previous week. This increase is similar to Solana\u2019s, which exploded 45%."

        "content": "A new Dune Dashboard (https://dune.com/ilemi/solana-compute) dropped today which has some good insights on applications taking up compute on Solana. As a refresher, compute units are Solana\u2019s form of gas, they are resources that a validator must use to process a transaction. The chart below lists a bunch of Solana protocols and there are some interesting findings:\n\n1. Jupiter takes anywhere from 3-5x the amount of compute as other AMMs per tx. Jupiter is an aggregator, so this of course makes sense as they are hitting numerous AMMs and thus require the extra compute to do so. Jupiter (combining v7 and v6) make up on average ~32% of Solana blocks.\n\nThe top 6 apps are all spot AMMS, with Zeta (derivatives) in 7th. AMMs all have higher average compute requested than orderbooks like Phoenix. Phoneix avg. CU is 17k vs the AMMs at 50 to over 200k. If Solana ever implements dynamic fee pricing based on compute, it\u2019s important for the OBs to stay low due to frequent placing/cancelling. spl token (token transfers) and Pyth oracle have the two highest number of invokes (transactions). They also have the lowest CUs per invoke as they are simple programs (send a token, update a price). Pyth is another application that doesn\u2019t really work without consistent low fees, at least not in the same capacity as it exists today on Solana.\n\nRight now Solana has a 48m compute limit. You can see during periods of high volatility that these limits start to get frequently. As Jarry from Phoenix/Ellipsis puts it:\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute units will be something discussed more frequently as Solana\u2019s fee market discussions progress. It\u2019s something we highlighted in Solana the Monolith as something that will eventually be tweaked. As it stands today, a transaction taking 250k CUs pays the same fee as one taking 4k CUs, but the work and resources the validator uses in the former is a magnitude higher. This probably doesn\u2019t make sense. At the same time, certain applications like Oracle transactions and LOB placed/cancelled orders can\u2019t be priced out.\n\nIt\u2019s good to see more Dune dashboard on Solana metrics\u2026 Solana data is a pain!"

        "title": "Ethereum and Solana lead DeFi surge as TVL and DEX activity soar - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The DeFi sector has experienced a significant increase in both activity and token prices, primarily driven by Bitcoin\u2019s October rally. Central to understanding this landscape is the concept of Total Value Locked (TVL) and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, two critical metrics that offer insights into the health and trajectory of DeFi protocols.\n\nTVL, the aggregate value of assets deposited in DeFi protocols, serves as a barometer for sector health and investor sentiment. CryptoSlate analysis found an interesting growth pattern across various chains. Ethereum, the frontrunner with $25.336 billion in TVL, has seen a 31.14% increase over the past month, cementing its dominant position in the DeFi space. Solana, though lower in overall TVL, showed the highest growth rate at 89.31%. Notably, all chains recorded positive growth over the month, indicating a robust expansion across the sector.\n\nThe number of active users on these chains offers additional insights. Despite its lower TVL, Tron boasts a significantly larger active user base of 1.69 million, which could result from a more retail-oriented user landscape. Conversely, Ethereum\u2019s lower active user count than its TVL might indicate a higher engagement of institutional or sophisticated, high-net-worth investors.\n\nThe market cap to TVL ratio is another critical metric, shedding light on the market\u2019s perception of a chain\u2019s value. Ethereum\u2019s ratio of 9.72 suggests a mature market. In contrast, Solana\u2019s higher ratio of 43.49 indicates either potential growth opportunities or an undervalued ecosystem, warranting closer investor scrutiny.\n\nName Protocols Active Users 1D Change 7D Change 1M Change TVL Stablecoins 24h Volume 24h Fees Market Cap to TVL ratio 1.Ethereum 946 304,493 -0.12% +6.50% +31.14% $25.473b $64.929b $1.718b $7.27m 9.63 2.Tron 26 1.69m -1.34% +5.04% +25.14% $8.291b $47.455b $11.33m $1.66m 1.13 3.

Ethereum leads with a 24-hour volume of $1.718 billion, accounting for a substantial portion of the total market. The rapid growth in DEX volumes on platforms like Solana and Polygon, with increases of 81.35% and 86.32%, respectively, reflects growing user adoption and confidence.\n\nName Weekly change Volume (24h) Volume (7d) TVL % of total Cumulative volume 1.

Ethereum continues to lead, both in terms of TVL and DEX volume, signaling strong investor confidence and market dominance.\n\nHowever, the rapid growth of newer platforms like Solana and Polygon suggests a diversifying landscape, with different chains catering to varied user needs and investment profiles. The market cap to TVL ratios further confirms the growth potential of lower market cap chains, with Solana and Polygon positioning themselves for future growth.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Key Highlights:\n\nRender network unveils successful migration to the Solana network, and bids farewell to Ethereum.\n\nIn a bid to make the migration process an easy and convenient experience for users, the Render Foundation has offered 1.14 million RNDR tokens to incentivize token holders.\n\nSolana ecosystem continues to expand after seeing an impressive surge of +144.00% in the last one month.\n\nRender Network, a leader in the decentralized computing space, has just experienced a massive shift within its ecosystem as the platform announces successful migration from Ethereum to the Solana network.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Render to the ecosystem, making it the latest project to fully migrate their network to Solana,\u201d Ryan Shea, Advisor to the Render Foundation expressed excitement on the company's latest move.\n\nThis remarkable upgrade comes after the platform considers a need to leverage Solana's exclusive use cases while avoiding the high gas fees offered on the Ethereum network.\n\nIn essence, while the Render network has successfully upgraded its core infrastructure to the Solana blockchain, users of Render can now explore several use cases on the network without the need to bother about high transaction fees.\n\nWhy Solana?\n\nAccording to the announcement, the company believes that Solana's incredible features in collaboration with its core infrastructure has the potential to unlock significant and exciting opportunities for the Render ecosystem.\n\nThis may include crucial new capabilities like real-time streaming and dynamic NFTs, creating a whole new experience for the Render community.\n\nMoreso, the company has also emphasized that Solana's superior speed, cost-effectiveness, and scalability, aligns suitably with Render's expansive vision. Hence, the big transition to Solana will mark a remarkable stepping stone towards achieving its vision.\n\nThe Render Network is committed to building a scalable and decentralized metaverse infrastructure. Thus, Solana\u2019s incredible transaction speeds, low costs, and commitment to web-scale architecture appears promising to facilitate the actualisation of the stated goals.\n\nRyan Shea, Advisor to the Render Foundation, acknowledged this noting that:\n\n\u201cSolana is the home of DePIN, and Render Network is one of the most important DePIN networks in existence today. Solana will help extend Render Network into new applications, such as machine learning and inference training, and unlock new utility through Solana\u2019s best-in-class technologies like compressed NFTs, on-chain order books, and real-time oracles.\u201d\n\nRender Offers 1.14 million RNDR as Incentives to Aid Token Transfers\n\nPer the announcement, users of Render who hold the RNDR token can now proceed to transfer their tokens to the Solana blockchain.\n\nIn a bid to make this an easy and seamless experience for users, Render Network has launched an Upgrade Assistant and Incentive program. It also announced the allocation of 1.14 million RNDR in grants to subsidize the high transaction fees charged on Ethereum.\n\nNotably, the Upgrade Assistant program will offer users the opportunity to transfer their RNDR tokens to Solana blockchain easily with a guarantee on safety and trustless upgrade process using the Wormhole protocol.\n\nMoreso, through the Upgrade Assistant, users have been encouraged to transfer their tokens from the Ethereum network to Solana as soon as possible as early migrators will be awarded a share of the 1.14M RNDR. Notably, holders who do not transfer their tokens within the specified period of three months, will have to pay their own gas fees to migrate RNDR tokens to the Solana blockchain when the period elapses.\n\nSolana Ecosystem Continues to Expand as it Welcomes Render\n\nRender's integration with the Solana ecosystem marks a significant addition to the continuous improvement the network has been witnessing lately.\n\nThe Solana market performance has been on the bright side for several months, with the SOL price showcasing an impressive surge of +144.00% in the last one month.\n\nAlthough the SOL price has decreased by -6.66% in the last 24 hours, the network still retains a bullish sentiment, seeing it outperform the Ethereum network. While Solana has impressively risen by 15.89x against Ethereum, it appears that this may continue to be the case following Solana's recent collaboration with Render Network against Ethereum.\n\nThe transition of Render between Ethereum and Solana implies that there will be a reduction in the use of the Ethereum network, while the use of Solana will be increased as it will see new adoption from the users of Render.\n\nNonetheless, the Render Network has also instructed that while the ETH token ($RNDR) will remain, it will no longer be maintained by Render Foundation and won't function on the Render Network."
