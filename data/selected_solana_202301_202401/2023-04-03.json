The \"addresses\" in this context refer to those that have executed a transaction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe six blockchains given are BNB Chain, Solana (wallets), Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Fantom.\n\nIn March, 6 blockchains had more than one million active addresses*:\n\n\n\nBNB Chain: 13.3M\n\nSolana (Wallets): 5.8M\n\nEthereum: 5.2M\n\nPolygon: 3.9M\n\nArbitrum: 2.2M\n\nFantom: 1M\n\n\n\n*Addresses that have executed a transaction. pic.twitter.com/DUFGR6ByWT \u2014 Nansen \ud83e\udded (@nansen_ai) April 3, 2023\n\nThe BNB chain led the pack in active addresses with 13.3 million users. Active wallets on the Solana network increased in March, outpacing other blockchains, including Ethereum.\n\nActive wallets for Solana stood at 5.8 million, while Ethereum saw 5.2 million active addresses, ranking third after Solana. Blockchains Polygon, Arbitrum and Fantom saw active addresses of 3.9 million, 2.2 million and 1 million, respectively.\n\nNansen lists the entities contributing to the growth of active addresses seen for the blockchains mentioned.\n\nOn the BNB Chain, Binance and PancakeSwap lead the way in terms of active users, but Web3 social projects like Space ID Protocol are also thriving. On Solana, Raydium Protocol, Stepn and Orca continue to lead the pack with the highest number of users.\n\nMeanwhile, on Ethereum, over the last 30 days, zksync and StarkWare have experienced a staggering 1,322% and 805% increase in users, likely due to airdrop farmers bridging to other chains."

        "content": "Grizzly accused several crypto influencers of posting undisclosed promotions of Rollbit Coin (RLB) \u2013 a small-cap Solana-based casino project.\n\nCrypto influencers accused of undisclosed shilling\n\nThe self-described \u201cchief rug officer\u201d at Pymons, the P2E platform, drew attention to a message posted by the Owner of Rollbit Coin, \u201cLucky,\u201d who called on \u201cexisting partners\u201d to participate in a \u201cnew bonus structure.\u201d\n\n\u201cwe\u2019ve came up with a new bonus structure in relation to RLB growth for our existing partners to align motivation and share more of Rollbit\u2019s success.\u201d\n\nLucky stated that influencers who promote RLB stand to gain $250,000 in the token if its price hits $0.20 and stays above that level for at least a week. A condition of participating was \u201cseveral organic RLB tweets\u201d each week.\n\nGrizzly posted examples of crypto Twitter accounts mentioning RLB in passing. The accounts shown belong to Pentoshi, who said, \u201cRLB is interesting to me,\u201d and cevo, who posted a price prediction of \u201canother 10x from here.\u201d\n\nHowever, in this tweet thread, Grizzly focused mainly on an influencer called \u201cGainzy.\u201d Specifically, Grizzly highlighted a post in which Gainzy said he bought $400,000 RLB but, having reviewed his wallet history, questioned why he sold the tokens over two weeks.\n\nGrizzly posed two possibilities, the selling was done innocently to remain sufficiently liquid, or the action was part of his promotion of the RLB token.\n\n\u201cWhy is Gainzy shilling a token that he is actively dumping, through a mixer and to a new address (and not the original address). Surely must be for \u201cliquidity\u201d purposes.\u201c\n\nGainzy responds\n\nAs the issue was circulating on social media, Gainzy denied promoting \u201canything token related,\u201d adding that his past RLB calls had lost him tens of millions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get paid to do anything token related, I lost 7 figures of my own funds buying rlb, and you\u2019re not going to see another rlb tweet from me because this has been beyond -ev\u201c\n\nHowever, Gainzy admitted to promoting the Rollbit Coin platform, not the token, saying he cannot comment on the incentive structure of other crypto influencers.\n\nGrizzly said he would \u201cshare the rest\u201d but requested Rollbit Coin make an official statement to save the \u201cback-and-forth\u201d between himself and the accused influencers.\n\nSo far, the gambling platform has not responded.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been going gangbusters this year and outperforming stocks by a wide margin.

        "title": "Guide to Identifying Upcoming Solana NFTs - CoinGecko Buzz",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nGetting on the whitelist for upcoming Solana NFT projects that are of interest ensures you'll be allocated a piece of the collection without having to compete with the general public on mint day.\n\nFollowing influencers on Twitter is a great way to find projects to follow, while participating in Discord communities are paramount for finding profitable projects, making connections and are a safeguard against getting rug pulled.\n\nBesides trading on secondary markets, traders can also explore setting up AMM pools.\n\nSolana solidified its position as one of crypto\u2019s best platforms for NFT interactions through the enactment of low transaction fees and high transaction speeds at the end of 2021. Since then, it\u2019s emerged as a competitor to Ethereum\u2014the chain always known for its flourishing NFT ecosystem.\n\nToday, a year and a half later, the Solana NFT space has prevailed through multiple events, like the FTX scandal and the removal of enforced on-chain royalties. Although NFT trading volume is lower than January 2022's all-time-highs, there are indications that the market is recovering. NFT traders can take the opportunity offered by quieter times of lower NFT activity for in-depth research, preparation and speculation on the next big Solana project that\u2019ll net them the highest returns.\n\nThis article will cover the basics when it comes to getting started with trading Solana NFTs. We will also look at how to find upcoming NFT projects with potential\u2014often the hardest parts for an NFT trader\u2014using Discord communities and Twitter profiles, and will also cover more advanced forms of NFT trading like utilizing AMMs. Before we begin, remember that all tips and tools I\u2019ll be covering are not meant to be taken as financial advice, and every reader should exercise discretion and do their due diligence before investing in any product.\n\nWhat are NFT Whitelists?\n\nIn this article, there'll be multiple mentions of NFT whitelists. NFT whitelists consists of wallet addresses that will receive early access to an NFT collection before its project launch. Every NFT project has a fixed amount of collection pieces (except open edition NFTs), so projects often hand out whitelist allocations to the most engaged members of the community as a way of recognising their efforts\u2014allowing them to have a guaranteed allocation for a piece of the collection without having to compete with the rest of the world when mint day comes around. Being on the whitelist can also include other benefits like lower prices.\n\nGetting Started\n\nBefore you start trading Solana NFTs, here are some of the tools you'll need.\n\nWallets\n\nTo begin trading Solana NFTs, you\u2019ll need a wallet, and Solana offers a multitude of different wallets to choose from.\n\nFrom the dawn of Solana NFTs back in 2021, Phantom has always been the go-to wallet for those interested in getting into the trade due to its user-friendliness. Other wallets like Slope and Solfare are also options to consider. Non-custodial software wallets like these are convenient for daily use and trading, although you may opt to keep your long-term holdings in a cold wallet for better security.\n\nPrice Trackers\n\nPrice trackers are essential tools for NFT traders. They help traders make better decisions when initiating or closing trades. For instance, when a new NFT project is launched, price trackers can signal to potential buyers whether the current price is optimal for buying into the project. This is done by analyzing indicators such as listing count and trading volume, which can maximize potential earnings. Similarly, for new minters of the project, price trackers can help them predict when the floor price of the NFT will reach its peak, allowing them to maximize potential earnings.\n\nSource: Solsniper | Solsniper\u2019s UI\n\nOne such price tracker is Solsniper, which offers more than just tracking. It has an integrated sniper\u2014an algorithm that instantly buys any NFT that has the user\u2019s desired trait or when the user\u2019s pre-set price has been triggered. Additionally, it allows crypto traders experienced in technical analysis (TA) to add other typical TA indicators like Bollinger Bands to trade NFTs, just like how they would trade crypto coins.\n\nMarketplaces\n\nEvery NFT trader needs to know where to buy and sell their NFTs at the best rates. Marketplace aggregators like Tensor compile listings from multiple marketplaces (including the biggest NFT marketplace, Magic Eden, on Solana) onto one common platform, and are often are the best marketplaces for NFT traders.\n\nSource: Tensor | Tensor UI\n\nTensor\u2019s growing adoption in the NFT community is partly due to its blazing-fast transaction speeds, outperforming other mainstream marketplaces like Magic Eden. Tensor even offers integration with TradingView, enabling it to also serve as a price tracker, while also offering a rewards system for incentivising users to trade on its platform.\n\nAnother type of NFT marketplace involves automated market makers (AMMs), enabling users to trade NFTs using liquidity pools just like how one would trade crypto using Uniswap. One such marketplace is Hadeswap, which allows its users to create buying and selling pools, an advanced method of trading that will be covered later on.\n\nUnderstanding Market Sentiment\n\nNow that we have all our necessary tools for trading Solana NFTs, how do we start finding projects to look into?\n\nTwitter\n\nFollowing some of the biggest influencers in the space could be beneficial for finding new projects, as some of these projects pay for promotion and coverage on their channels, or collaborate with these influencers to give out whitelist spots.\n\nNot a BTC Maxi, but there is a few things I know:\n\n\n\n- There is only 535 BTC @DeGodsNFT\n\n- @frankdegods has consistently been a BTC Maxi from the jump\n\n\n\nFrank with his own BTC collection = ??\n\n\n\nThus I picked up 4 more OTC this morning at .57 BTC each. FIWB! pic.twitter.com/rgA0mDvO7T \u2014 S\u25ceL Big Brain (@SOLBigBrain) March 19, 2023\n\nS\u25ceL Big Brain is one of the biggest Solana influencers out there, and they post updates on Solana and the crypto space in general, along with their takes on NFT projects.\n\nTwo other influencers to follow are Anglio and SolHub. They promote NFT projects quite often, and have their own gated Discord alpha groups that they admit people to on a weekly basis by sharing limited-invite links on Twitter as part of a giveaway.\n\nOther personalities to follow in the Solana NFT space includes Fake Jonny and Cozy \u24e3he Caller, who post analyses on projects and insights in the Solana space on their Twitter accounts.\n\nThe more Solana NFT Twitter profiles you follow, the greater your exposure will be to understanding the general market sentiment. You\u2019ll have a better understanding of the hottest upcoming mints, or if there are any bearish changes to the ecosystem.\n\nDiscord\n\nGetting into closed influencer discord groups is often the best way of initiating yourself into the forefront of the Solana NFT space, since they're usually the most active groups that have high-quality alpha calls and whitelisting opportunities. Best of all, all this is usually completely free of charge.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have access to these groups, there are also other public discord servers that provide an active community for one to join, some of which I\u2019ve been in for a couple of months now and initially found through connections.\n\nDo note that while these are all public servers, most of them require newcomers to be active to be granted full access.\n\nFounded by a developer-turned-influencer, Linked Dao prides itself as an educational hub for those starting in Solana NFTs, offering an extremely active community alongside free alpha calls, whitelist opportunities and educational articles.\n\nCreated by some big names in the space, The Nifty hosts Twitter spaces and YouTube live streams that discuss NFT topics on a daily basis, while also having a strong community of various types of traders as well as connections with some of the biggest names in Web3, perfect for beginner traders who wish to immerse themselves in the culture of the space.\n\nA lesser known server with a quieter community, Leverage Devils features a multitude of free alpha calls spanning through different portions of Web3, ranging from NFTs to technical analysis in crypto.\n\nJoining a wide array of Discord communities is absolutely crucial for learning about new and upcoming projects in the space, and beyond that, also allows you to connect with other NFT traders.\n\nMinting and Trading Solana NFTs\n\nMinting Upcoming Projects\n\nNow that you\u2019re up to date on the latest happenings through Twitter and Discord, you should be exposed to the onslaught of new and upcoming projects. But how do you determine which projects have the potential to yield a decent return on investment? Typically, the top projects in the space already have an established reputation, and you can easily discover what they are by asking in any of the Discord servers above.\n\nGetting whitelisted in those servers is a top priority, whether it\u2019s through whitelist opportunities offered by different Discord communities or through being active in the project\u2019s Discord. These projects also occasionally offer presale allocations to select communities, allowing members to mint their NFTs at lower prices and in bulk, again emphasizing the importance of being active in multiple Discord communities.\n\nFollowing that, finding the next big project before it gains hype is another method NFT traders use to maximize returns. When a project becomes hyped with tens of thousands of Discord members, getting whitelisted becomes exponentially harder, since the competition is fiercer and there\u2019s a smaller chance you\u2019re going to get noticed by the project moderators and scoring a spot on the whitelist. As such, finding these projects in their pre-hype days allows you to secure your whitelist spot, and maybe even get multiple accounts whitelisted as well.\n\nThe Bastards - A hyped project backed by an IRL animation studio that recently minted out with 30k members in their discord\n\nHere are some common indicators that a project has potential:\n\nBacked by a real company or studio in the Web2 world with a good reputation\n\nFounded by an influencer or significant reputable figure like a member of the core team of a blue chip project within the space\n\nHas appealing, unique, and pfp-ble art (being able to be put as a profile picture easily) and a theme that runs throughout the project, alluding to good branding\n\nHas experience building tangible Web2 or even Web3 products with solid use cases that integrate solid business models, which ensures sustainability.\n\nAs a bonus, look out for free mints, which have low risk-to-reward ratios.\n\nReading through the roadmaps and whitepapers of new projects should give you a rough idea of what they\u2019re trying to achieve, and if they possess any of the qualities outlined above. If they do, start conducting in-depth research into them.\n\nFor example, you could start a chat with their founders to find out more about the project and raise questions about sections of the roadmap which seem unclear. Assessing the founders\u2019 responses will then give you an accurate gauge if they are competent enough to run the project successfully, and also if they have the passion and motivation to continue with the project for the long term.\n\nWith the hundreds of new projects popping up in the space every day, it's important to be efficient and sift through ones that make empty promises to being the next \u201cBAYC\u201d or \u201cMoonbirds\u201d and learn to pick out those that could be potential rug pulls.\n\nIdentifying Rug Pulls\n\nMinting NFTs expose users to the risk of a rug pull. Most of the indicators mentioned previously also act as reassurances against their founders engaging in a rug pull. There are also more subtle indicators that can be taken into account before choosing to invest in a project, like the age of the founders\u2019 accounts, if the founders share any mutual servers, the age of the project\u2019s Discord, and the like-to-follower ratio on the project\u2019s Twitter.\n\nSadly, rug pulls are widespread due to the inherent anonymity within Web3, leading to a lack of accountability. Even with doxxed project founders, there are no consequences for rug pulling due to the absence of an enforcement system. As such, one must exercise absolute caution when minting projects.\n\nJoining various Discord communities can provide a good safeguard against getting rug pulled because members often warn each other about red flags around projects, which are usually uncovered through joint investigations.\n\nExample of a red flag from community members\n\nIf you want to minimize the risk of getting rug pulled while still earning profits, you can also consider secondary scalping or trading as another option.\n\nTrading on Secondary Markets\n\nThe term \u201cscalping\u201d usually refers to a swing trade that traders initiate in a short time frame, reducing their exposure to the project and hence the associated risk of getting rug pulled. Scalping NFTs belonging to those hyped projects right after their typical post-mint dumps can also net huge returns for those who can analyze when to buy in using the price trackers mentioned above.\n\nPost-mint dumps are usually caused by minters seeking to secure profits, where they repeatedly undercut the floor price causing it to fall below the value that the NFTs started trading at. Scalp traders who spot these post-mint dumps can often buy multiple NFTs at these lower dumped prices. They then wait for the floor price to recover, and then sell all of them, netting them a decent profit. As mentioned before, those experienced in crypto TA can also use price trackers to trade secondary NFT markets using indicators.\n\nPost-mint dump for one of the biggest collections on Solana currently\n\nAdvanced Trading\n\nGetting Involved in Other Networks\n\nSolana is not the only cryptocurrency that provides NFTs. Several other chains such as Aptos, Polygon, Near, and Ethereum (which is dominant in the NFT space) also offer NFTs, and each of these have their respective unique NFT infrastructure, transaction fees, and minting methods. Learning how NFTs work in other chains, and how to trade them, opens up greater opportunities for finding profitable projects. During rare times when liquidity flows from the Solana NFT ecosystem to other chains, being versatile also allows you to quickly adapt to maximize profits.\n\nAMMs\n\nOnce again, AMMs stand for automated market makers, and as mentioned at the beginning of the article, AMMs offer another unique way of earning revenue. A buying pool on an AMM marketplace like Hadeswap aids a trader in dollar-cost-averaging into a specific NFT collection by using a setting called the Delta. The Delta is a fixed percentage or amount that the trader can set for the reduction in price between consecutive buys in a collection, and conducts these buys by putting out collection offers on that NFT collection. Similarly, a selling pool containing NFTs sells them based on the Delta, such that the price of each NFT incrementally increases by the set Delta every time an NFT is bought from the pool.\n\nInterface for creating a pool on Hadeswap\n\nCreating buying and selling pools simultaneously for a particular NFT collection then creates a two-sided liquidity pool, which provides liquidity to both buyers and sellers of a collection. Hadeswap, like many other AMMs, incentivizes the creation of these pools by allowing the pool creators to collect fees on the price spread as people swap in and out of the pool. Though it might sound complex, at its core, utilizing AMMs to generate fees taps into the basic principle of \u201cbuying low and selling high\u201d, where the AMM leverages market inefficiencies\u2014slight differences in prices when selling or buying something\u2014to generate fees, and in turn, profits.\n\nTo maximize the amount of fees generated from a two-sided pool, pool creators often choose NFT collections with the highest trading volumes, and also pour in the most amount of starting liquidity they can to cover the biggest ranges of prices effectively.\n\nConclusion\n\nBesides trading, the Solana NFT space offers a ton of other revenue-earning options, like botting hyped mints. If you\u2019re familiar with sneaker botting, buying the top Solana minting bots will allow you to get NFTs of hyped projects in their public sales, albeit also needing to set up virtual servers and nodes to accommodate the botting infrastructure.\n\nSome Solana NFT projects also offer their own play-to-earn apps, with one notable example being STEPN. You can also take on part-time jobs in Web3, like being moderators in a community, which can also net you some decent money. Diversifying your income sources and exploring other methods of earning within the space is always a good thing.\n\nAs always, the above is not intended to serve as financial advice or an endorsement of the products and personalities featured.
