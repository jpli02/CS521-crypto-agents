        "content": "Coindesk reported that the U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into Saber Labs founders Ian and Dylan Macalinao. The probe is reportedly surrounding how the brothers utilized various pseudonymous identities to orchestrate inaccurate crypto gain metrics.\n\nThe brothers reportedly crafted over 11 various identities across the web to \u201cbuild an ecosystem of interlocking financial products that double and triple-counted crypto deposits by passing tokens between themselves.\u201d Moreover, the scheme reportedly \u201cboosted a key growth metric for Solana by billions of dollars,\u201d in 2021.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US DOJ launches investigation into the founders of #Solana stablecoin exchange Saber Labs. January 11, 2023\n\nSaber Labs Founders Probed for Fraudulent Activity\n\n2022 had seen one of the largest financial crimes in history occur in the crypto sector, with the fraud of FTX. Now, it appears as though American authorities are probing another potential financial crime in the crypto sphere to start the new year.\n\nCoindesk has reported the U.S. Department of Justice is launching an investigation into Saber Labs Founders Ian and Dylan Macaliano. The brothers are the founders of the Solana Stablecoin Exchange and orchestrated a web of pseudonymous identities to increase a key metric for Solana in 2021.\n\nThe duo would reportedly craft a plethora of fake online identities that would \u201cdouble and triple\u201d count crypto deposits by \u201cpassing tokens between themselves.\u201d Coindesk also gained access to an unpublished blog by Ian Macalinao noting, \u201cThe metric to optimize for in Summer 2021 was [total value locked (TVL)]\u201d according to the report.\n\nSource \u2013 Solana.com\n\nAdding, \u201cTVL can only count if protocols are built separately, so I devised a scheme to maximize Solana\u2019s TVL: I would build protocols that stack on top of each other, such that a dollar could be counted several times.\u201d Conversely, investigators are probing for information regarding sabers\u2019 various crypto projects. These include Defi app Sunny Aggregator, and Cashio, a stablecoin project that was the victim of a hack that lost millions in March.\n\nConclusively, Ian wrote the code for both using similar fake identities. \u201cIf an ecosystem is all built by a few people, it does not look as authentic,\u201d he stated. Adding \u201cI wanted to make it look like a lot of people were building on our protocol rather than ship 20+ disjoin [sic] programs as one person.\u201d"
