        "content": "Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has finally weighed in on the US approach to crypto regulation.\n\nButerin shared his thoughts on the matter early Friday morning through a Twitter ask me anything (AMA). Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang asked him, \u201cHow are you feeling about the US policy approach to crypto?\u201d\n\nButerin responded with sympathy for his blockchain counterparts that are in US regulators\u2019 crosshairs, naming Solana in particular. He seemingly also acknowledged Ethereum\u2019s somewhat privileged position.\n\n\u201cThe one comment I\u2019ll make is that I feel bad that @solana and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don\u2019t deserve it, and if ethereum ends up \u2018winning\u2019 through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn\u2019t even a victory,\u201d Buterin tweeted.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t consider other chains, such as Solana, to be the real competition. The true threat, he said, is \u201cthe rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on us.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSolana (SOL) was deemed a security in the SEC suits against both Binance and Coinbase. And so were cardano (ADA), Polygon\u2019s token MATIC, filecoin (FIL), the Sandbox\u2019s SAND, and Axie Infinity (AXS).\n\nEther went untouched in the SEC\u2019s crackdown, and even for casual observers, this wasn\u2019t surprising.\n\nWhen SEC Chair Gary Gensler testified before the House Financial Services Committee in April, he refused to give a definite answer on whether ether was a security or a commodity.\n\nAnd a little over a month before Gensler\u2019s congressional appearance, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam was a bit clearer on where ether stood, since his agency has already allowed the trading of ether futures products.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made the argument that ether is a commodity,\u201d Behnam told senators in March. \u201cIt\u2019s been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite some time.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe would not have allowed the product \u2013 in this case the ether futures product \u2013 to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset because we have litigation risk.\u201d\n\nThe first regulator to claim ether is a security was New York Attorney General Letitia James, though her view hasn\u2019t gained much traction.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Better Buy: Solana or Cardano? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "While both Solana and Cardano face significant regulatory risk, both could also be prime \"buy the dip\" candidates.\n\nWhen the Securities and Exchange Commission filed its lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance (BNB 0.83%) and Coinbase Global (COIN 8.59%) in early June, it also named Cardano (ADA 0.01%) and Solana (SOL 0.53%) as unregistered securities. The news was understandably shocking for many investors, and both cryptos have tumbled during the past 30 days.\n\nOn June 27, Robinhood Markets officially delisted both Cardano and Solana, meaning Robinhood customers won't be able to buy or sell them anymore on the platform. But that doesn't mean these two cryptos, both of which still rank among the top 10 cryptos in terms of market cap, are going away. In fact, this could be a \"buy the dip\" situation for both. Let's take a closer look to see which is the better buy right now.\n\nCardano\n\nOf the two, Cardano is easily the safer bet, all other things being equal. That's because Cardano has taken a number of steps to shield itself from regulatory risk.\n\nFor example, at the end of 2022, Cardano formally launched a new phase of development called Voltaire, in which it will become more and more decentralized while handing off more and more power to its community. The ultimate goal is for Cardano to become self-governing, without the need for a third-party company to guide the growth of the Cardano blockchain.\n\nCardano, too, has taken plenty of steps, too, to work with regulators in Washington, D.C. The founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, has testified in front of Washington lawmakers, and has been widely praised for his defense of the crypto industry. As Hoskinson sees it, Cardano has never been a security, and never will be a security, and therefore has been unjustly caught up in the SEC crackdown on crypto.\n\nIn terms of long-term growth, the big catalyst for Cardano is still decentralized finance (DeFi). While Cardano has had some success in other areas of the blockchain world, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the real future growth catalyst is decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nIn 2023, Cardano's DeFi growth has been at record levels, and it's finally looking like Cardano might one day become one of the world's top DeFi ecosystems. The metric to watch here is total value locked (TVL), which measures how much of a crypto token is \"locked up\" in DeFi protocols. Cardano's TVL is now at a 10-month high, so that certainly bodes well for future growth.\n\nSolana\n\nFrom a purely regulatory perspective, Solana carries much more risk than Cardano. For one, Solana was caught up in the meltdown of crypto exchange FTX last year, due to the close links between former FTX Chief Executive Officer Sam Bankman-Fried and Solana. And, secondly, Solana has relied on a venture capital model of development.\n\nThis raises the question: Is Solana really a security? After all, venture capitalists invest in companies, right? But, like Cardano, Solana is making the case that it shouldn't be classified as a security.\n\nThe major selling point for Solana is its vast blockchain ecosystem. Solana is already a leader in areas ranging from NFTs to DeFi and has continually found new ways to build this ecosystem. In April, for example, Solana completed the migration of Helium, a decentralized wireless network, to the Solana blockchain.\n\nThe latest piece of the puzzle for Solana was the launch of a $999 crypto phone (known as the Saga) in April. As Solana sees it, the future of crypto is mobile. And this Saga phone will be the key to onboarding millions of new users to the blockchain world. This could lead to new growth in the Solana ecosystem, and the creation of new decentralized applications running on the Solana blockchain.\n\nThe concept of mobile crypto is a big, big idea, and it's the key reason I think Solana has so much more upside potential than Cardano.\n\nCaveat emptor, crypto investors\n\nOf course, if you are risk averse, you should avoid both Cardano and Solana (and probably crypto in general). There is simply too much regulatory risk over the short term, and any direct enforcement action by the SEC could pose an existential threat. We've already seen how even the specter of SEC enforcement can spook the market, and how trading platforms like Robinhood would rather delist these tokens than risk running afoul of regulators.\n\nBut if you're an investor with a high tolerance for risk, there is plenty of upside potential for both of these cryptos. My personal pick is Solana. Over the long term, Solana has the type of innovation strategy that could pay off big and lead to a much higher valuation."

        "title": "The Bankless Guide to Solana - Bankless",
        "content": "First publicly launched in 2020, Solana is a blockchain designed to offer much higher \u201cbase layer\u201d transaction throughput capabilities compared to other popular Layer 1 (L1) blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nFor instance, while Bitcoin is currently processing ~4 transactions per second and Ethereum is pushing ~15 TPS without factoring in Layer 2s (L2s), Solana is facilitating ~2,700 TPS, and the network can theoretically support transaction levels up to the 65k TPS range.\n\nAccordingly, Solana\u2019s ability to power near-instant transactions in extremely inexpensive fashion has made the network an attractive smart contract platform for a growing number of web3 developers and users, which is evidenced by the chain's resurgence in 2023.\n\n\n\nAnd while Solana is presently \"monolithic\" and may eventually face scaling pains with regard to how it handles all its own transaction, security, and data availability needs, there's also no reason why it can't become increasingly modular over time with further advances around Solana L2s.\n\nHow Solana works\n\nSolana uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH), which is a variant of Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nPoH optimizes the transaction process by assigning a timestamp to each transaction, allowing Solana to process transactions as they arrive instead of organizing them into blocks. This style of consensus, combined with the blockchain\u2019s Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithm, creates a meld of security, efficiency, and speed.\n\nIn contrast to Ethereum's use of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for executing \u201csmart contracts,\u201d Solana employs the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) that executes \"programs.\" These programs are written in the Rust programming language and compiled to the WebAssembly bytecode format (WASM), enabling Solana to achieve high performance and parallel processing capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, while Ethereum wallets primarily support ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens and Ethereum-based applications, Solana wallets are tailored for Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens and Solana-based apps.\n\nThe pulse of Solana\n\nAs of this guide's latest update, the total value locked (TVL) in the Solana DeFi ecosystem was ~$1.75B USD according to DeFiLlama.\n\nThat current TVL level makes the network the 5th-largest DeFi network in the cryptoeconomy today behind only Ethereum, Tron, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum. However, with regard to daily trading volume stats, Solana's been second only to Ethereum lately and has even temporarily pulled ahead of Ethereum here on multiple recent occasions.\n\nAnother bright spot for Solana is its NFT ecosystem, which is presently among the largest in crypto alongside Ethereum's and Bitcoin's respective NFT scenes. With rising wallets like Backpack and Phantom, rising collections like Mad Lads and Claynosaurz, and rising marketplaces like Magic Eden and Tensor, the prominence of Solana NFTs is officially here to stay.\n\nThe SOL token\n\nSOL is Solana's native token that is used for various purposes within the network\u2019s ecosystem, such as paying for transaction fees, participating in Solana staking, and as a medium of exchange around DeFi and NFT apps.\n\nAs of this guide's latest update, SOL was trading at approximately $103.30 USD, boasting a market capitalization of $45B. This positions it as the 5th-largest crypto in the cryptoeconomy today. The SOL circulating supply stands at over 436 million, with a total supply of more than 569M that steadily increases per inflationary staking rewards.\n\nWhat you need to use Solana\n\n\ud83d\udc5b A Solana wallet \u2014 With both browser and mobile support, Phantom is currently among most popular wallets for creating and managing Solana addresses. After downloading, you\u2019d create your first wallet by backing up your mnemonic seed and creating a password, etc. Then you'll be ready to receive your first SOL deposit! \ud83e\ude99 Starter SOL \u2014 To start making Solana-based transactions, you'll need SOL in your wallet to cover gas costs. An easy way to begin is to purchase a small amount on a crypto exchange like Coinbase or Kraken and then deposit it to your wallet address.\n\nWhat to do on Solana\n\nThe largest DeFi app on Solana today, Marinade Finance is a liquid staking protocol built on the Solana network that enables users to easily stake their SOL. In doing so, Marinade users receive \"staked SOL\" tokens (mSOL) that offer passive yield and can be used in the Solana DeFi ecosystem or unstaked at any time to exchange back to regular SOL.\n\nJupiter is an aggregator of decentralized exchanges on Solana that offers efficiently routed trades and in-built features like limit orders and dollar-cost averaged (DCA) buys. The project recently launched its native JUP token and plans to release further airdrop waves to its community of users.\n\nWith many 1,000s of listed collections, Magic Eden has become a premier destination for NFT activity, offering a one-stop platform for users to discover and trade Solana NFTs and beyond. In addition to its core secondary marketplace offering, the platform features a Launchpad service for exclusive minting drops and partnerships with NFT brands.\n\nAdditional Solana resources\n\nIf you want to dive in deeper and enhance your knowledge of Solana in general, there are a range of additional resources to check out. Some good starting points include:\n\nZooming out\n\nSolana has emerged as a popular L1 blockchain that addresses the need for speed and affordability in the decentralized apps space. Its technology stack, built upon innovations like the SVM and Proof of History, has paved the way for a growing ecosystem of projects that caters to various sectors like DeFi, NFTs, and more. And while Solana will continue to face competition from Ethereum + L2s, it's begun to hold its ground better than ever before!"
