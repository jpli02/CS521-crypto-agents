        "title": "Bitcoin: What Lasts Longer, Bull or Bear Market? - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "2022 will go down as one of the worst years for the cryptocurrency industry. With Bitcoin [BTC] witnessing a major plummet to mid $15K levels, the market experienced a significant correction phase. However, the narrative seems to be changing with BTC moving beyond $24,000 at press time, While many claims that the bull market has already started, a few others continue to put forth the bull trap speculation. But how long will the bear market last?\n\nHistoric data points out that the Bitcoin bull run has lasted for 2.5 years on average. Bear markets, on the other hand, have time and again existed for just 1 year following the bull market.\n\nMarket cycles usually consist of four phases. It starts off with accumulation, followed by markup, and then distribution. The last one is the markdown phase which usually is associated with the bear market. Therefore, when Bitcoin enters its accumulation phase once again, a bear cycle is usually inching toward its end.\n\nSeveral analysts believe that Bitcoin is currently in its accumulation phase. This is mostly due to the fact that the king coin is being overbought.\n\nAs seen in the above chart, the Relative Strength Index [RSI] indicator revealed that NTC was being excessively purchased at the moment.\n\nHere are other reasons why Bitcoin might have started its bull cycle\n\nFounder of the Capriole Fund, Charles Edward took to Twitter to highlight how the bull market was here. This was related to the addresses that were currently at profit. He tweeted,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re likely at start of a new cyclical Bitcoin bull market, inside the volatility circle. Percent addresses in profit has bounced significantly from 50-70%, a structure which usually sees profit taking, but also marks a regime change.\u201d\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin was trading for $23,440.32 with a 1.49% daily drop."

        "title": "NFT market shows signs of recovery as January trading volumes hit 7-month high - TechCrunch",
        "content": "It appears the NFT market is slowly getting back on its feet. Trading volumes rose for two months straight, with January scoring the highest volumes since June last year, according to the Dapp Industry Report: January 2023.\n\nThe growth in January marked a stark difference from the trend of the past few months \u2014 October saw trading volumes dip to a low of $662 million \u2014 but in November, the market halted the downward trend to stay at $662 million, per the report.\n\nVolumes then recovered in December, rising slightly to $683 million, and increasing 38.5% from that number to $946 million in January.\n\nA number of blockchains allow traders to buy and sell NFTs, but Ethereum has held the leading position with over $36 billion in all-time sales, data from NFT aggregator CryptoSlam showed. In comparison, Ronin and Solana \u2014 the second and third largest blockchains by NFT sales volume in total \u2014 had about $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.\n\nJanuary was strong for both Ethereum and Solana, which saw trading volumes of $659 million and $85 million, respectively.\n\nFebruary is showing signs of continued strength as well \u2014 at least so far. As of February 3, the Ethereum blockchain had $26.5 million sales across more than 25,500 unique buyers, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nWhile Ethereum accounts for the lion\u2019s share of trading volumes, with more than 78% of all trades on the blockchain, Polygon had the biggest influx of traders in January, the report showed.\n\nPolygon\u2019s trading volume grew 124% to $46 million in January from $20 million in December. In the past week, NFT sales volume on the blockchain grew 43.5% to reach $2.8 million, indicating continued interest in the blockchain.\n\nIn late December, two large Solana NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, said they would leave the blockchain in 2023, which stirred up conflicting sentiments across the community. DeGods said it would migrate to Ethereum, and y00ts plans to move to Polygon.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the year, we noticed that much of the creator economy\u2019s attention was focused on ETH and Solana,\u201d Ryan Wyatt, CEO of Polygon Studios, previously told TechCrunch. \u201cTherefore, we decided to go against the trend and focus on the untapped potential of web3 by onboarding large enterprise brands, DeFi platforms and gaming companies. We did this successfully through ecosystem fund investments and white-glove partnership support.\u201d\n\nAs big NFT collections like DeGods and y00ts diversify their alliances to blockchains, it could also draw in other holders who are seeking new opportunities or see value elsewhere.\n\nThe consecutive growth of the past couple months could also point to a broader upward trend across the crypto market. It could also potentially help drive creators and projects to form new use cases in the NFT world as they look to capitalize on the bullish marketplace."

        "content": "As the massive gains that the cryptocurrency market has recorded since the year\u2019s turn have started to slow down, crypto traders and investors are analyzing the price movements of Solana (SOL), trying to discern its standing by the end of February 2023.\n\nThe crypto community on CoinMarketCap, through the Price Estimate feature, is forecasting that SOL will likely trade at an average price of $22.94 on February 28, 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the machine learning algorithms over at cryptocurrency tracking platform PricePredictions have projected that the price of Solana on February 28, 2023, would reach $24.56, as per the latest data accessed by Finbold on February 3.\n\nSolana 30-day price projection. Source: PricePrediction\n\nShould the predictions, made on the basis of technical analysis (TA) factors like the Bollinger Bands (BB), relative strength index (RSI), moving averages (MA), and moving average convergence divergence (MACD), prove correct, it would mean that Solana would, at that time, be trading 0.29% higher from its current price of $24.49.\n\nIn terms of the indicators on the finance tracking website TradingView, the 1-day sentiment gauges for Solana are largely optimistic. Specifically, their summary is currently indicating \u2018buy\u2019 at 11, which is aggregated from oscillators in the \u2018neutral\u2019 area at 9, and MAs pointing toward \u2018buy\u2019 at 10.\n\nSolana 1-day sentiment gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nBullish factors for Solana\n\nThe machine learning algorithm\u2019s predictions for Solana by the end of February arrive as the network is working on Marinade (MNDE), a liquid-staking derivative that aims to become the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on Solana.\n\nIt is also important to note that Solana\u2019s founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal published an optimistic report on the future of the ecosystem on January 31, 2023, as the number of developers on the blockchain has increased 83% in a single year, to more than 20,000.\n\nOn top of that, Solana was the most loved digital asset in 2022, alongside Ethereum (ETH), as opposed to Bitcoin (BTC), which was the most hated, according to the AI sentiment-tracking analysis reported on by Finbold on January 20.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nAs for its current price, SOL was at press time changing hands at $24.49, which represents a decline of 2.24% over the previous 24 hours but still an increase of 0.51% compared to seven days before and an 83.35% gain on its monthly chart.\n\nSolana 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s market capitalization stands at $9.04 billion, ranking it as the 11th-largest digital asset by this indicator, just below Polygon (MATIC) with $10.36 billion, according to the data retrieved from the crypto tracking website CoinMarketCap on February 3.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "How to Swap Crypto with Ledger\n\nWatch 3 min Beginner\n\nSHARE\n\nEver wanted to exchange one crypto for another? This is a how-to guide on how to swap with Ledger, so you can grow your assets and always stay within the security of Ledger ecosystem.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHi there, ever watch one of your coins die a slow death, while another just shoots to the moon? Or maybe you\u2019ve got one coin, but need to pay for something with another, and you don\u2019t feel like buying more crypto with your bank accounts? If either of these is true, then swapping might be for you.\n\nWHAT\u2019S SWAPPING?\n\nWhat\u2019s swapping? Well, it\u2019s a simple process where you exchange one crypto for another. Kind of like swapping dollars for euros. You send a swap partner one type of crypto, and they return another of your choosing. Simple, really\u2026 ready to try? Okay, let\u2019s go!\n\nSTEP BY STEP GUIDE\n\nFirst, connect your Nano to your computer and unlock it. Then, open Ledger Live and click on \u2018Manager\u2019 on the bottom left of the dashboard. Once you\u2019re in the Manager, click on \u2018Apps installed\u2019. Here, you\u2019ll see a list of apps that are already installed on your Nano. Since you\u2019re swapping from a crypto you already have into one you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll need to make sure of two things. One, that you\u2019ve installed the apps of the currencies you want to swap. And two, that you have installed the Exchange app. So, take a second and make sure both Exchange and the apps for your chosen crypto are listed under the \u2018Apps installed\u2019 tab. And if they\u2019re not, just return to the App catalog and install what you need. So, once that\u2019s done, click \u2018Swap\u2019 on the left hand menu in Ledger Live, and choose the assets you want to swap. In our case, we want to swap Bitcoin for Ethereum, but you can select any assets on the drop-down list. Now, you\u2019ll enter the amount you want to swap, we\u2019ll do 0. 0015 BTC here. And you\u2019ll see how Ledger Live automatically calculates your ETH amount, based on the current exchange rate.\n\nCLEAR SIGN YOUR TRANSACTION\n\nAlright, now, before we continue, let\u2019s review the information on the bottom. So, the provider is the partner that will perform this one. It\u2019s Changelly here, but other parts of the world might use a different partner. The rate is the current exchange rates of the currencies you\u2019re trying to swap. The fees pay for your transaction, and Changelly charges an industry low. You can lower your fee, but we don\u2019t recommend it because you might slow down your transaction. And, of course, the target account is the account in Ledger Live where you want your funds to go. If you have multiple accounts for the same type of crypto, you can choose between those accounts here. Now, click the \u2018Exchange\u2019 button. Ledger Live will double-check that you have the right apps and accounts installed. And if anything is missing, it\u2019ll automatically install it here, and then ask you to open the Exchange app on your Nano. Go ahead and do that. To confirm, the side panel will now open, and you\u2019ll be asked to review transaction details. If everything looks good to you, just confirm the swap on your Nano, and that\u2019s it, your crypto is now being sent to and from Changelly, and all you have to do is wait for the transaction to be confirmed. In most cases, it only takes a few minutes, but it\u2019s still good practice to write down your swap ID in case you need to contact Changelly Support. And that\u2019s it, swap complete. Swapping is the same on all Nanos, so you\u2019ll never have to re-learn it. And if you have questions, or if you\u2019re ready to learn more, check out the other tutorials at the Help Center. And, as always, stay safe on your crypto journey, see ya!"
