        "title": "What Is Solana's SPL Token Standard and Token-2022 - CoinGecko Buzz",
        "content": "What Is the SPL Token Standard on Solana?\n\nThe SPL token standard on Solana defines how NFTs and fungible tokens on the Solana blockchain operates, and ensures that SPL tokens are interoperable with Solana wallets and smart contracts. Unlike Ethereum's ERC, where there are different token standards for different types of tokens like ERC-20 and ERC-721 (NFTs), the SPL token standard applies to all token types on Solana, where the difference in operation is defined at the token creation stage. Solana's Token-2022 will offer developers and users new minting and account features.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Solana Primary Library (SPL) defines how smart contract tokens on the Solana blockchain operate. The operational standards are delineated in the library and must be adhered to by any token created on the Solana blockchain. These tokens are known as SPL tokens.\n\nThe SPL is similar to the Ethereum Request for Communication (ERC) standard on Ethereum.\n\nSPL tokens run parallel to the native Solana token on the Solana network and utilize the network\u2019s infrastructure. Fees for transactions involving SPL tokens are paid in Solana coin (SOL).\n\nSolana's Token-2022 will enhance the functionality of SPL tokens by allowing developers to add interest-bearing logic, transfer fees, and other account specific functions.\n\nSolana is the 6th largest crypto asset by market cap at the time of writing, with a total market cap of over $26 billion. It has an ecosystem of decentralized applications and smart contract tokens, including NFTs and fungible tokens. These smart contract tokens are developed according to the Solana Primary Library (SPL) standards. They are known as SPL tokens and are commonly referred to as \u2018Solana tokens\u2019.\n\nThe Solana blockchain\u2019s operation has a major effect on how SPL tokens function. Here\u2019s a little background about the Solana blockchain.\n\nWhat Is The Solana Blockchain?\n\nSolana blockchain is a Layer 1 Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH) network. It boasts a transaction speed of 65,000 TPs and a block time of 800 milliseconds. The POH consensus mechanism is an improvement of the POW consensus mechanism, which operates using timestamps. Each block is identified by its hash and the exact time they were added to the blockchain. A Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) is implemented to ensure consistency in the block production and arrangements.\n\nAs an L1 blockchain network, Solana operates a native token \u2013 Solana. Solana is the tax currency of the Solana blockchain; that is, fees for transactions on the network are paid in SOL. It is also vital to the security system of the network. Validators in the network stake Solana coins on their nodes and are rewarded with newly produced Solana coins when they verify a block successfully.\n\nSolana is a smart contract blockchain. It powers applications that operate through smart contracts and also supports the creation of smart contract tokens. Smart contract tokens on the Solana network are known as SPL tokens.\n\nWhat Are SPL tokens?\n\nFundamentally, SPL tokens are tokens that operate on the Solana blockchain. SPL defines the set of rules that define how tokens should operate on the Solana network, where compliance with these standards will ensure interoperability with Solana wallets and smart contracts.\n\nSPL tokens run parallel to the Solana native coin and can be spent like any other cryptocurrency. However, they are abstracted from the core operations of the Solana blockchain, unlike the native coin. Therefore, SPL tokens are not used in the network\u2019s consensus, and every transaction involving SPL tokens comes with a network fee which is paid in the native Solana coin.\n\nNevertheless, the native Solana coin is technically an SPL token as well since it adheres to the provisions of the SP Library. But unlike other SPL tokens, it is integrated into the core operation of the network from the genesis stage.\n\nFeatures of SPL tokens\n\nSPL tokens are unique to the Solana blockchain, and do not follow the usual Ethereum-based systems on other blockchains like TRON's TRC-20 and BSC's BEP-20. Here are some features of SPL tokens:\n\nThey Can Be NFTs And Fungible Tokens\n\nThe SPL defines operation standards for fungible and non-fungible tokens on the Solana blockchain. Unlike ERC, where different standards are set for different types of non-fungible and fungible tokens, the Solana Primary Library doesn\u2019t have a specially computed standard for the different token types.\n\nSo, the SPL standard applies to fungible and non-fungible Solana tokens. The difference in operation is defined at the token creation stage, but this is basically in terms of the number of tokens minted, divisibility, and extra attributes that could be abstracted.\n\nComposability\n\nThe Solana Primary Library is composable and SPL tokens inherit this attribute. The source code for an SPL token can be re-used to create another SPL token. This makes it easier for developers to create new tokens. Depending on the creator\u2019s intent, a few features (like token name and supply statistics) could be changed at the point of creation, but the majority of the code base can be deployed without modification and still deliver expected results.\n\nEfficiency\n\nThe network conditions of the Solana blockchain have a direct effect on SPL tokens. Solana\u2019s acclaimed fast transaction processing speed applies to SPL tokens. Therefore, transacting with SPL tokens might feel faster and more efficient than other tokens that run on a different blockchain network.\n\nHow Are SPL Tokens Created?\n\nSPL tokens are created by interacting with the smart contract facility of the Solana blockchain through pieces of code developed using the Solana blockchain\u2019s programming language (Rust). This process is known as Minting.\n\nTo mint an SPL token, you can write the code from scratch or modify the codebase for an existing SPL token. Certain applications have also been developed to help creators mint SPL tokens without doing much coding. During the minting stage, the core properties of the token are defined. For instance, to create a non-fungible SPL token, the supply is set to one and the decimal function is removed. For fungible tokens, the developer defines the decimal function to allow the token to be sent in splits. Also, the supply data is adjusted according to the project\u2019s tokenomics strategy.\n\nOnce created, the tokens function like any other crypto asset, unless defined otherwise by the creator at the minting stage.\n\nWhat Can SPL Tokens Be Used For?\n\nSPL tokens can be used just like any other crypto assets within the boundaries. Some use cases for SPL tokens include:\n\nICOs and IEOs\n\nMainstream firms or native cryptocurrency projects that wish to raise funds for their project\u2019s development can conduct ICOs (initial coin offerings) or IEOs (initial exchange offerings) using SPL tokens. The tokens are minted to represent the project\u2019s valuation, like shares. The project team can mint an amount of SPL tokens to represent the equity and also define future distribution data to suit the project as it grows. The token holders are shareholders in the project and dividends could also be defined in terms of receiving a share of newly generated tokens.\n\nDAOs\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can also tokenize the governance of the project using SPL tokens. Projects can issue SPL tokens to their community and develop voting portals that accept these tokens for submitting and voting on proposals. Each SPL token issued for this purpose represents an opinion, where the number of SPL tokens held by an individual is proportional to their influence in the community decisions.\n\nUtility Tokens\n\nSPL tokens can also be used as utility tokens for blue chip projects in any sector. Projects like these integrate the token into the routine operation of their project. They are native tokens of the project and either give holders certain privileges or are designed to be the access point to the application. Utility tokens are also used as incentives in many contemporary projects.\n\nMemeCoins\n\nCommunity-building and fun-based projects can also issue SPL tokens as an index of their community strength and marketing prowess. Projects like these are popularly referred to as memecoins. The flexibility of SPL tokens means they can be configured to meet memeCoin tokenomic requirements, like implementing high supply statistics and several other features which memecoins are known for at the minting stage.\n\nNFTs\n\nDigital asset creators can mint unique SPL tokens as digital signatures to their multimedia, gaming assets, or any known use case for NFTs. In this case, the creator mints an SPL token with a supply set to \u2018one\u2019 and no decimal function. This removes the fungibility aspect and such tokens can function as an NFT. There are provisions for extra functions like defining the NFTs attributes and transfer arrangements. Some notable NFTs on Solana include Mad Lads and Famous Fox Federation.\n\nRWAs\n\nSPL tokens can also be created to represent Real-World Assets. The mode of operation is defined by the creator, but the SPL standard is fit for known RWA tokenization procedures. Future implementations could make SPL tokens more suitable for RWAs than they currently are, with discussions on the Solana Developer Forums mentioning the potential creation of a token standard that caters to RWA needs like escrow facilities, token freeze/nullification, and more.\n\nSPL vs. ERC-20 Tokens\n\nERC-20 is an Ethereum standard for creating fungible tokens. SPL tokens and ERC-20 tokens share significant similarities as they both specify the operational set-ups for crypto assets that run on a blockchain. The ERC-20 standard is considerably older and used by more cryptocurrency projects, but SPL tokens are gaining relevance as well. Here are some differences between both of them;\n\nNetwork\n\nSPL tokens operate on the Solana blockchain, ERC-20 tokens operate on the Ethereum blockchain or any other EVM blockchain. These blockchains have different attributes which are inherited by the tokens. The technological difference in the blockchain also affects the operation and application of both token standards. ERC-20 tokens can only be used on EVM dApps, while SPL tokens can only be used on Solana dApps.\n\nOperational Standards\n\nThe SPL standard is designed for tokens that operate on the Solana blockchain or any other network that adopts a virtual machine similar to the one used by the Solana blockchain. The ERC-20 standard on the other hand is designed for tokens that operate on the Ethereum blockchain or blockchains that use the EVM. The tokens\u2019 operations are adjusted to complement these virtual machines. The code for their creation is written in a language understood by the virtual machine, for instance, most ERC-20 token contracts are written in Solidity while SPL tokens\u2019 contracts are written in the Rust programming language.\n\nAsset Type\n\nERC-20 token standard defines the operation of fungible tokens only, and NFTs on the Ethereum and other EVM networks are created using specific standards (ERC-721 and ERC-1155). However, the SPL standard can be used to create Fungible and Non-fungible tokens, and it is also used as the token standard for all tokens on Solana.\n\nHandling\n\nERC-20 tokens can be managed using EVM-compatible wallet applications like MetaMask while SPL tokens are held in Solana wallet applications like the Phantom wallet. While many wallet applications are multi-chain, wallets that are specific for any of these networks (Ethereum or Solana) do not support tokens from the other network. In simpler terms, you cannot transact your Solana tokens from your MetaMask wallet (except using a Solana wallet MetaMask Snap) and ERC-20 tokens cannot be held on Solana wallets like Phantom.\n\nSPL Tokens ERC Tokens Network Solana blockchain Ethereum Blockchain Handling Compatible with Solana wallets and DApps Compatible EVM wallets and DApps Operational Standards Operates as specified by the Solana Primary Library (SPL) Operates as specified by the corresponding ERC standard Asset type Uses the same SPL standard for NFTs and fungible tokens Has different ERC standards for NFTs and fungible tokens\n\nSolana\u2019s Token-2022\n\nThe Solana token program is set for a couple of new introductions as part of the Token-2022 program currently in development. Token-2022 is meant to enhance the functionality of SPL tokens, giving way for new abilities in addition to the existing attributes. Token-2022\u2019s new introductions will expand the minting and spending properties of SPL tokens and will allow users to explore even more use cases for SPL tokens. The new introductions are classified into Minting and Account functions. Some of them include;\n\nNew Minting Functions\n\nInterest-bearing tokens: Allows creators to add interest-bearing logic to an SPL token.\n\nTransfer fee: Developers can introduce extra fees when an SPL token is transferred.\n\nTransfer functions: Developers can specify advanced transfer operations for an SPL token. Tokens can be set as non-transferrable\n\nNew Account Functions\n\nTransfer memo: This will allow users to add a note to SPL token transfers.\n\nAccount ownership: Allows users to define rigid ownership data for an account. This cannot be changed once set.\n\nAccount state: Allows users to compute a set of conditions that applies only to a selected account.\n\nAccording to official information, the Token-2022 program is still in development and not meant for full production use until a stable release. In the meantime, the status of the project can be tracked here. Pending its full release, the newly-introduced functions of the Token-2022 program could be a significant upgrade for the token system on the Solana blockchain.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Solana ecosystem is a significant one. SPL tokens have seen a breakthrough in adoption. This article gives an insight into the SPL standard and how SPL tokens operate under the hood to enable the creation of flexible tokens on the Solana network. SPL tokens have a performance advantage over ERC tokens on the Ethereum network; this is thanks to the enhanced speed and overall performance the Solana network is known for. While there are concerns around the level of decentralization in the network, the agility associated with the Solana network is inherited by the chain\u2019s SPL tokens.\n\nWhen comparing SPL tokens and ERC tokens, both tokens have strengths that make them fit for specific purposes on their respective blockchains. As both cryptographic token standards develop, this will become even clearer. Having said that; note that this article only explains the SP Library and SPL tokens, and should not be considered financial advice. Always do your own research before investing in any asset."

Join the growing community of traders who are embracing this new era of decentralized finance powered by Solana.\n\nUnderstanding Decentralized Exchanges on Solana\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) have revolutionized the way people trade cryptocurrencies. They eliminate the need for intermediaries, allowing direct peer-to-peer transactions.There are a few key aspects that set them apart.\n\nAutomation of Trade Settlements\n\nSolana DEXs leverage smart contracts to automate trade settlements. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with predefined rules written into code. These contracts ensure that trades are executed efficiently and without the need for human intervention. By automating settlements, Solana DEXs provide users with faster transaction times compared to traditional centralized exchanges.\n\nTrustless Transactions\n\nOne of the significant advantages of using Solana DEXs is trustless transactions. Trustless means that users can engage in transactions without relying on a central authority or intermediary to facilitate the process. Instead, transactions are executed directly between the parties involved using smart contracts and blockchain technology.\n\nFull Control over Funds\n\nIn traditional financial systems, users often have to entrust their funds to a centralized exchange or third-party custodian. However, this is not the case with Solana DEXs. Users retain full control over their funds as they do not require custody services from any centralized entity. This decentralized nature ensures that users have complete ownership and access to their assets at all times.\n\nLiquidity Pools and Automated Market Making\n\nSolana DEXs utilize liquidity pools and automated market making mechanisms to facilitate trading. Liquidity pools are pools of funds provided by liquidity providers who earn rewards for supplying liquidity. Automated market making algorithms adjust prices based on supply and demand dynamics within these pools, ensuring efficient trading even during periods of high volatility.\n\nCentral Limit Order Book (CLOB)\n\nSome Solana DEXs implement a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) model for trading. A CLOB matches buy and sell orders based on price and time priority. This model allows users to place limit orders at specific prices, which are then matched with corresponding orders from other participants. The CLOB model enhances transparency and fairness in trading, as all participants have equal access to order information.\n\nTop Solana DEX Platforms Overview\n\nSerum, Raydium, and Mango Markets are three popular decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms on the Solana blockchain.

It provides users with access to a diverse selection of tokens, including popular cryptocurrencies and emerging Solana-based projects.\n\nDeep Dive into Solana DEX Aggregators\n\nImproved Liquidity through DEX Aggregators\n\nDEX aggregators, such as Marinade and Bonfida, play a crucial role in enhancing liquidity within the Solana ecosystem. These platforms source prices from multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs), allowing traders to access a larger pool of liquidity. By aggregating liquidity from various sources, these platforms ensure that users can execute trades at competitive prices without impacting the market significantly.\n\nBenefits of Using DEX Aggregators\n\nOne significant advantage of utilizing DEX aggregators is the reduction in slippage. Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of an asset and the actual executed price due to market volatility or insufficient liquidity. With aggregators sourcing prices from multiple exchanges, they can minimize slippage by finding the best available price across different pools of liquidity.\n\nMoreover, DEX aggregators also offer better pricing for traders. By scanning multiple exchanges simultaneously, these platforms identify opportunities for arbitrage and provide users with access to more favorable rates. This ensures that traders can maximize their profits by executing trades at optimal prices.\n\nUsing DEX aggregators grants traders access to a wider range of tokens. Instead of being limited to a single exchange\u2019s token offerings, users can explore various assets available across different decentralized exchanges. This increased accessibility allows for greater portfolio diversification and enables traders to take advantage of emerging investment opportunities within the Solana ecosystem.\n\nSimplifying Trading Experience Across Solana DEX Platforms\n\nAnother critical role played by DEX aggregators is simplifying the trading experience across different Solana DEX platforms. Rather than navigating multiple interfaces and managing separate wallets for each exchange, users can consolidate their trading activities on a single aggregator platform.\n\nBy providing a unified interface, these aggregators streamline the trading process and save time for users who would otherwise need to switch between different platforms manually. Traders can view and compare prices, execute trades, and manage their assets seamlessly through a single user-friendly interface.\n\nFurthermore, DEX aggregators often offer additional features and tools to enhance the trading experience. These may include advanced charting capabilities, portfolio tracking, and even yield farming opportunities. By consolidating these functionalities into one platform, users can enjoy a more comprehensive trading experience without the need for multiple applications or platforms.\n\nExploring Advanced Features of Solana-based DEXs\n\nLimit Orders, Stop-Loss Mechanisms, and Token Swaps\n\nSolana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offer a range of advanced features that can enhance your trading experience. These features include limit orders, stop-loss mechanisms, and token swaps. Let\u2019s delve into each of these features to understand their benefits and how they can optimize your trading on Solana DEXs.\n\nLimit Orders\n\nLimit orders are a powerful tool for managing risk and maximizing profits in the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading.
