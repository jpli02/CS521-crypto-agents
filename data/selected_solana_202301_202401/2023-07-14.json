        "content": "One token that keeps hitting the max is bSOL, the LST issued by Solana validator service SolBlaze. The 5,000 bSOL tokens currently deposited on MarginFi represent nearly 7% of all bSOL tokens in existence; even more are waiting on the sidelines, said the pseudonymous founder of SolBlaze (who goes by SolBlaze). The founder is cutting trading deals across Solana DeFi to increase bSOL\u2019s prominence, and thus its liquidity, and therefore its caps on MarginFi."

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst is issuing a Litecoin (LTC) warning as he updates his outlook on Ethereum (ETH)-rival Solana (SOL) and another red-hot altcoin.\n\nPseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 50,400 YouTube subscribers that altcoins are likely going to underperform in the near term.\n\nHowever, he says there will be some exceptions such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\n\u201cThe one thing that I\u2019m pretty certain about is that we\u2019re going to see altcoins continue to underperform as a whole, but there\u2019s obviously going to be outliers like Bitcoin Cash has been doing okay in the last few days.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Cash soared from around $105 on June 20th and is trading at $276 at time of writing, a more than 162% increase.\n\nLooking at Litecoin, DonAlt warns that the peer-to-peer payments network may be heading for a market correction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure if it\u2019s done or not, the Bitcoin Cash play, but the Litecoin play I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nAccording to DonAlt\u2019s chart, Litecoin was retesting the $95 level at the time of his prediction. Litecoin has since reclaimed the $103 level, a 7.2% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, DonAlt says if Solana abruptly collapses to $10 it would be a good buy.\n\n\u201cIf [Solana] goes to $10 in one candle right now, would I bite? Yes. I generally like it at $10.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $29.16 at time of writing, up more than 33.5% during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAmerica's largest crypto exchange Coinbase today said in a statement that it stands by staking and that it will fight the service in court\u2014but would stop staking for new customers in California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn a Friday statement, the San Francisco-based digital asset company that \"Americans in every state deserve access to the same technology and economic opportunities as people everywhere,\" and therefore it would push back against certain states requiring a staking ban.\n\n\n\nBut for now, customers in the four states will be unable to stake additional assets through Coinbase while these actions are pending.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Due to the actions taken by state regulators in California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, customers in those states will be unable to stake additional assets through Coinbase while these actions are pending,\" the company said, adding that customers' crypto that was staked before these orders were issued remains unaffected.\n\nThe news comes after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month sued Coinbase for allegedly failing to register as an exchange, clearing house, and broker despite providing investors these services.\n\nWall Street's biggest regulator also alleged that Coinbase offered and sold unregistered securities via its staking service.\n\nShortly afterwards, a multi-state task force that includes California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin along with Alabama filed charges against the company for violating securities laws.\n\nStaking is the process of \"locking-up\" cryptocurrency to keep a blockchain\u2019s network running. Those who hold proof-of-stake assets\u2014such as Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization\u2014pledge it to the network by sending it to a specific blockchain address and can receive rewards for doing so.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut it\u2019s a controversial issue: The SEC in February hit American crypto exchange Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\n\n\nEditor's Note: This post was corrected reflect that 10 states are alleging Coinbase has violated securities laws."
