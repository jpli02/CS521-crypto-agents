        "content": "Shakeeb Ahmed, a security engineer who exploited two Solana DeFi apps, has pleaded guilty, according to statements from authorities on Dec. 14.\n\nDamian Williams, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), announced a guilty plea from the perpetrator. He stated:\n\n\u201cFive months ago, my Office announced the first ever arrest involving an attack on a smart contract. Today \u2026 Shakeeb Ahmed pled guilty and agreed to return all of the stolen crypto to his victims \u2026 Today\u2019s conviction shows that no matter how sophisticated the methods used, fraud is fraud, and we will swiftly catch and convict you.\u201d\n\nAhmed launched the first of two attacks starting on July 2, 2022, when he targeted an unnamed decentralized exchange to generate $9 million through inflated fees. Ahmed agreed to return all but $1.5 million of the stolen funds if the exchange refrained from reporting the attack to law enforcement. However, SDNY authorities ultimately arrested and charged Ahmed in July 2023.\n\nLater proceedings revealed that Ahmed had carried out a second attack on Nirvana Finance, a Solana-based decentralized finance platform, around July 28, 2022. In that attack, Ahmed manipulated flash loans to purchase Nirvana\u2019s ANA token at a low price, then resold those tokens at a higher price to obtain $3.6 million. After a failed bounty negotiation with Nirvana, Ahmed refused to return the stolen funds, and Nirvana shut down due to a nearly complete loss of funds.\n\nThough the hack against Nirvana Finance was reported as it occurred, Ahmed\u2019s involvement in the attack was not known until today.\n\nOver $12M stolen\n\nThe announcement states that Ahmed stole over $12 million from the two platforms and attempted to hide the theft through several actions.\n\nNotably, Ahmed swapped his ill-gotten gains for Monero (XMR), moved funds through crypto mixers such as Samourai Whirlpool, used a blockchain-hopping strategy, transferred funds to the Ethereum blockchain, and transacted on international crypto exchanges. He also searched for information related to legal defenses and the possibility of fleeing the United States.\n\nAuthorities said that Ahmed has pleaded guilty to one count of computer fraud for a maximum sentence of five years in prison. His sentence will be determined in March 2024. Ahmed has agreed to pay restitution of $5 million to his victims.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Rollercoaster, Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions, Solana (SOL) Developments: Bits Recap Dec 14 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nBitcoin (BTC) reached over $44,000, a 20-month high, before falling below $41,000, but recently surged again to $43,000, influenced by the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to keep interest rates unchanged and hint at future rate cuts.\n\nRipple (XRP) also saw significant fluctuations, moving from around $60 to almost $70, then back to $60, with recent bullish trends suggesting potential further increases.\n\nSolana (SOL) made news with its price surge and NFT sales volume, outperforming Ethereum in weekly NFT sales with a recent 53% increase to nearly $68 million, while Ethereum saw a 5% drop.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Flashes Green Again\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization \u2013 Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 has experienced enhanced volatility in the past few weeks. Its price stood at around $38,000 at the start of December, but in the following days, it took the offensive, reaching a 20-month high of over $44,000. However, the asset could not keep up with the momentum, dropping below $41,000 earlier this week.\n\nAnd while bears started envisioning a more severe plunge in the near future, BTC launched another uptrend a few hours ago, soaring to $43,000 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data). The latest surge could be attributed to the FOMC meeting held on December 13.\n\nRecall that the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, hinting about three rate cuts next year. Such a pivot has been touted as a bullish factor for the cryptocurrency industry, particularly Bitcoin, as it would make borrowing money cheaper and thus allow more investors to deal with risk-on assets.\n\nThose willing to see what other factors could trigger a BTC rally in the near future could take a look at our latest dedicated video below:\n\nIs Ripple (XRP) Ready for a Final 2023 Sprint?\n\nRipple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 is another digital asset that experienced severe price swings since the beginning of the month. Its valuation was hovering around $60 on December 1, while approximately a week later, it spiked to almost $70. However, the subsequent market correction suppressed its price back to $60.\n\nXRP headed north once again today (December 14), following the bullish trend in the entire sector. Numerous analysts, including the X (Twitter) users EGRAG CRYPTO and JD, believe the token\u2019s price might climb even higher in the short term. The former claimed XRP could surpass $1.20 by New Year\u2019s Eve, whereas the latter envisioned substantial gains should the coin bounce off on weekly close.\n\nThose curious to check how Ripple\u2019s token might perform in the remaining weeks of the ongoing year could take a look at our video below:\n\nHow is Solana (SOL) Doing?\n\nLast but not least, we will focus on Solana and the recent developments surrounding the blockchain protocol. Apart from making the headlines with SOL\u2019s massive price surge in the past several months, many other advancements are worth noting.\n\nAs CryptoPotato reported, Solana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) sales volume has marked a bigger increase on a weekly basis than Ethereum. The figure with the former has reached almost $68 million, 53% higher than the observed data a week before, while the latter recorded a 5% drop.\n\nSolana\u2019s NFT sales volume for the last 24 hours currently stands at over $10 million (a 27% increase on a daily basis), while Ethereum has comprised around $14 million."
