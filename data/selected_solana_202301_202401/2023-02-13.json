        "title": "Clergy sex abuse suits could bankrupt San Diego diocese - National Catholic Reporter",
        "content": "The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego said Feb. 10 it may declare bankruptcy in the coming months as it faces \"staggering\" legal costs in dealing with some 400 lawsuits alleging priests and others sexually abused children.\n\nIn a letter that was expected to be shared with parishioners over the weekend, Cardinal Robert McElroy said the cases were filed after California lifted a statute of limitations on childhood sexual abuse claims.\n\nAssembly Bill 218, which was signed into law in 2019, allows alleged victims to sue up until age 40. Also, beginning in 2020, it opened a three-year window for filing lawsuits without age limitations.\n\nMost of the alleged abuse cited in the suits took place 50 to 75 years ago, and the earliest claim dates to 1945, Kevin Eckery, communications director for the diocese, said at a Feb. 10 news conference, KNSD-TV reported.\n\nEckery predicted that it would cost the diocese $550 million to settle the cases, none of which have gone to trial."

        "title": "Co-Founder of Banned @NFT Instagram Account Seeks $6 Million for Lil Baby Crypto Dice Game - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOne of the co-founders behind the controversial @NFT Instagram account is back at it again, looking for investors to pump millions into his latest crypto venture.\n\nA year ago, the @NFT Instagram account was accused of charging $100,000 for paid posts\u2014ads which it published without disclosure\u2014and falsely listed investor Mark Cuban as one of its co-founders. It was also accused of promoting multiple scams and \u201crug pull\u201d NFT projects. Now, one of its co-founders, Aaron Avruskin, has resurfaced with a new crypto business idea: a browser-based mobile crypto gambling game with rapper Lil Baby called \u201cRollies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore JPEGs and Shitcoins, and a world removed from the bright lights of Las Vegas and the high roller lifestyle\u2014three dice, a patch of concrete, and a group of individuals bound by their desire for more combined to produce a game that shaped Hip-Hop culture,\u201d reads the Rollies pitch deck, which has been viewed by Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the 18-page deck, \"Lil Baby's Rollies\" is currently seeking $6 million in seed funding and has been in development since January 2022. The @NFT Instagram account was banned in February 2022, but the associated @NFT Twitter account was already banned by January of last year. Avruskin has not yet responded to Decrypt's request for comment for this story.\n\nThe Rollies deck mostly consists of graffiti-style fonts, images of dice, and a large helping of Lil Baby's likeness. The presentation promises a \u201cfree\u201d Lil Baby NFT drop of between 50,000-100,000 NFTs, a Rollies crypto mobile gambling game, and a roadmap focused on sponsored tournaments and subsequent NFT drops.\n\nAccording to the deck, the project is hiring artist Distortedd\u2014who\u2019s worked with the likes of Reebok, Redbull, and Adidas\u2014to design art for the project and says it enlisted gambling game developer Aquimo to create the core Rollies game product. Aquimo has not yet responded to Decrypt's request for comment.\n\nRollies also claims it has secured Doodles, Pudgy Penguins, Sappy Seals, and six other projects as partner NFT collections. Such \u201cpartners\u201d will promote the Rollies brand, receive allowlist spots, participate in Twitter and Discord talks, and have \u201csome access\u201d to Rollies live events, per the deck.\n\nRepresentatives for Sappy Seals did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. Pudgy Penguins' CEO replied only with question marks via DM. A representative for Doodles told Decrypt: \"Doodles has no involvement in Lil Baby's upcoming Rollies NFT collection.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the second and third quarter of 2023, Rollies plans to \u201cdeploy subsequent funding\u201d to launch a native token, which is currently unnamed. No tokenomics or further details were provided regarding the token\u2019s viability or distribution. It also wants to raise another $10-20 million in funding at that time.\n\nThe third \u201cphase\u201d of Rollies consists of the launch of Lil Baby\u2019s \u201cCultural Fund,\u201d which will supposedly help \u201cBlack and brown\u201d entrepreneurs with \u201cculturally savvy business acumen and plans.\u201d\n\nThe deck claims that within two years, Rollies could earn $16 million in \u201cwearables and forging\u201d drops (likely NFTs), $9 million in \u201csponsorship sales,\u201d and $5 million in \u201csecondary sales\u201d (royalties from NFT trading). Rollies\u2019 seed funding round plans to offer investors a Common Share Offering, a move which one venture capital consultant told Decrypt was highly unusual for a seed round.\n\n\u201cCommon shares are typically offered later on, in a Series B,\u201d the consultant told Decrypt.\n\nCommon shares are also typically reserved for employees and founders, while preferred shares are sold to investors.\n\nBut just like a game of dice, investing in seed-round projects can also be a high-risk gamble for potential investors. In startup companies\u2019 seed rounds, there\u2019s typically little to no completed product for investors to evaluate, and many initial seed investments are made because investors trust the founder\u2019s ability to deliver what\u2019s been promised.\n\nA crypto VC firm partner told Decrypt in a direct message that VCs typically examine numerous factors including the founding team\u2019s background, as well as consider what kind of \u201cproblem\u201d the project is solving before investing. The partner said that unreasonable valuation asks, a lack of understanding user \u201cpain points,\u201d and a team with little experience are red flags that can cause concern.\n\n\u201cThe team is the most important component in the early stage,\u201d the partner, who would only speak on the condition of anonymity, told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs for Lil Baby\u2019s involvement in the project, it\u2019s unclear to what extent he\u2019ll actually be participating, but the rapper does like NFTs. He\u2019s tweeted about them in the past and has been collecting PFP NFTs including a pink Bored Ape with a baby bonnet, which he later mutated.\n\n\u201cWhile celebrities and rappers have harmed the space with countless cash grabs and rug pulls, Lil Baby has done Web3 the right way,\u201d the team behind Rollies says in its pitch deck.\n\nA source familiar with Lil Baby\u2019s NFT plans confirmed to Decrypt that the rapper has been working on an NFT project of his own for at least six months\u2014but it\u2019s unclear if the project in question is Avruskin\u2019s Rollies project or something else entirely.\n\nRepresentatives for Lil Baby have not yet responded to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to include comment from Doodles."

        "content": "California is going green \u2014 green bins that is.\n\nAt the beginning of last year, Senate Bill 1383 went into effect requiring all residents and businesses to reduce the amount of organic waste they send to landfills. This is all in an effort to decrease the amount for short-lived climate pollutants, such as the greenhouse gas methane, which is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timespan, according to the California Air Resources Board (CARB).\n\nWhile many cities in San Diego County have already been collecting organic waste, the city of San Diego recently began to roll out its organic waste disposal program. Here are some frequently asked questions:\n\nWhat is SB 1383?\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Short-lived Climate Pollutant Reduction law, often called SB 1383, went into effect Jan. 1, 2022. It establishes targets to reduce methane emissions in California and sets goals to reduce the disposal of organic waste. SB 1383 requires that by 2025 the state has reduced the amount of organic waste entering landfills by 75%.\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nWhy focus on composting to fight climate change?\n\nSeparating food scraps from regular everyday trash is the easiest and most impactful way for an individual to fight climate change, said Mallika Sen, the director of environmental solutions at the Solana Center for Environmental Innovation.\n\n\u201cNot everyone can afford to put solar on their roof, not everyone can afford to drive an electric car,\u201d Sen said. \u201cSo many of the solutions that I think get talked about, they\u2019re not available to average people. Not sending your organics to the landfill and making sure you don\u2019t waste food is something that each of us can do.\u201d\n\nFood Waste Facts\n\nA family of four wastes on average $1,866 per year on food\n\n40% of food is never eaten\n\n39% of waste in San Diego County landfills is organic\n\nSan Diegans throw away an average of 5.3 pounds of food waste per day Sources: USDA, SD Regional Climate Collaborative\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nAre all San Diegans required to compost now?\n\nNo, there are a few exceptions primarily in the unincorporated areas of San Diego County. The county has designated sparsely populated areas where residents and businesses can apply to be exempt from the composting requirement. More information about the types of exemptions and how to apply for a waiver can be found here .\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nWhen will I receive my green bin?\n\nWhen your green bin for organic waste arrives will depend on where you live and your housing situation.\n\nIf you live in the city of San Diego and you\u2019re a city curbside customer the city has already started distributing green bins, but if you haven\u2019t received one yet don\u2019t worry. They are being delivered over the next few months and Deputy Director of Environmental Services Ken Prue said all residents will have received their bins by the end of July. City residents will also receive a kitchen pail to put food scraps. Check out the chart below to get a sense of when your green bin will be delivered based on your trash day.\n\nIf you rent in the city of San Diego you should see a green bin at your apartment complex or condo soon. The timeline is dependent on your landlord and the private trash hauler that services the property. Ask your landlord or property manager where you can put your organic waste.\n\nIf you live in an unincorporated part of San Diego County it will depend on which non-exclusive franchise hauler you use. Check with your trash hauler if you have not received your green bin yet.\n\nIf you don\u2019t live in any of the above mentioned areas check with your local jurisdiction. This information is often located on the city\u2019s website under environmental services.\n\nIf you live in Imperial County it will depend on the city and its non-exclusive franchise trash hauling provider. Check your city's website for more information or the Imperial County Department of Public Works Solid Waste Division's website here.\n\nBrenden Tuccinardi / KPBS A sign is displayed outside the Miramar Landfill, Feb. 12, 2023. The majority of waste collected in the city of San Diego ends up at this landfill, which also houses a compost facility, the Miramar Greenery.\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nWhere does the organic waste go?\n\nAll of the organic waste collected will end up at a composting facility or an organic waste processing facility. The city of San Diego operates a composting facility at the Miramar landfill, called the Miramar Greenery, where organic waste is turned into compost, and then it's made available for purchase. City residents can fill up two cubic yards of compost for free if they load it themselves.\n\nEDCO, the waste hauler that services most of North County, operates an anaerobic digestion facility, where organic waste is broken down by bacteria in an oxygen-free environment. The resulting methane emissions are captured and then converted into natural gas fuel used by EDCO trucks.\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nHow do I start composting?\n\nThe key is to start small, Sen said.\n\n\u201cStart with a little bin under your sink and start with the little food scraps from chopping,\u201d she said. \u201cSoon you will discover, \u2018Oh now I\u2019m done with dinner, maybe I can scrape my plate scrapings in there.\u2019 It just starts expanding.\u201d\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nHow do I reduce my food waste?\n\nSolana Center experts recently reported in an educational webinar the USDA estimates a family of four spends about $1,866 per year on food that they end up throwing away. So not only is it important to dispose of food waste correctly, but being mindful of how much food you throw away could actually save you money.\n\nFood waste reduction begins at the grocery store, before you buy.\n\n\u201cBefore you go shopping, plan your meals,\u201d Sen said. \u201cDon\u2019t just go (to the grocery store) and randomly pick up stuff.\u201d\n\nDoing what Sen called \u201cwish shopping\u201d creates a lot of food waste, she said, because you end up buying things you eventually end up throwing away. Sen also cautioned against buying things simply because they\u2019re on sale, because it often leads to people buying more than they need.\n\nAnother way to reduce the amount of food you waste is ensuring food is stored correctly, especially produce. Solana Center experts recommend Savethefood.com , a resource that helps determine the best way to store food from beans and rice to fruits and dairy, so that it lasts longer giving you more time to use it.\n\nWhat other composting questions do you have?

To prevent your bin from smelling, Sen said, keep it in a shaded spot with the lid closed always.\n\nOn trash day, after the bin has been emptied, remove any remaining waste, and if needed, rinse out the bin, making sure to pour the water out on your grass or other landscape area. If you pour it on the street it will pollute our waterways. And, if you notice your green bin starting to smell, sprinkle a layer of baking soda on top, Sen said.\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nWhat are some other resources?\n\nThe Solana Center has a lot of information on composting and offers workshops on a variety of sustainability topics."
