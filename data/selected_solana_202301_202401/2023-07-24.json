        "title": "Solana (SOL) Token Declining; Troubled by Parrot Protocol Move? - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Solana (SOL) is one of the most popular high-utility tokens known for its scalability and high-speed transactions. SOL tokens lost more than 10% weekly and approximately 38.98% in a year.\n\nIn the 52 week time frame, the Solana token lowest traded at $8.00, while its highest trading price was $48.38. On July 14, SOL traded at $32.15, which is 34.26% higher than the price at press time.\n\nAt press time, the utility token was trading at $24.40. It opened trading at $24.76, dipped to $24.07, hit a high of $24.83, with a trading volume of 578.352k, constitutes of sellers.\n\nAccording to market analysts, the SOL price might have been affected by the recent decisions of Parrot Protocol to redeem PRT tokens for liquid treasury value and also to transition to a no-token protocol. The PRT redemption price was established at $0.0045 per token based on the proposal.\n\nRelevant data shows that Parrot Protocol is a Solana-based liquidity network offering borrowing and lending services. At press time, data from DefiLlama revealed that the Total Value Locked of the protocol was $8.93 Million.\n\nRegarding market capitalization, Solana holds the 9th position, and its market cap is $9,857,976,182. Moreover, SOL is the 13th most traded token in terms of trading volume, although a steep decline of 15.61% can be observed in its trading volume.\n\nSolana (SOL) Token Price Analysis\n\nAfter analyzing the chart pattern, it is noticed that a sudden drop of 5% in SOL prices is caused by strong bearish momentum in the short-term. This means that investors are investing money for the short-term and then withdrawing the stakes.\n\nSource: SOL price chart from TradingView\n\nHowever, Solana has also managed to maintain investors\u2019 interest in the long-term, and other fundamental aspects remain unchanged. The number of active addresses on Solana has multiplied 10x over the past 12 months, showing its strengthening network effects.\n\nIt is assumed that the SOL price might surge positively if buyers succeed in overruling sellers in the upcoming sessions. The immediate resistance of the Solana token is $32.51, and if buyers push the prices in a positive direction, it might trade at around $38.77.\n\nAt the time of publishing, the leader of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), was trading at $29,783 with an intraday trading volume of $10 Billion. Earlier this week, BTC was holding the first position in the market and was the most traded token/coin, but it was recently surpassed by Tether (USDT).\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational ideas only and do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.

        "title": "\u200cCrypto Expert James Mullarney Says Explosive Price Surge Imminent For Solana - Zenger.News",
        "content": "James Mullarney, the host of InvestAnswers, says that Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) could come close to its all-time high once Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) kicks off its bull market.\n\nIn a YouTube video, Mullarney said that Solana could go up to $250, an increase of more than 870% from its current price of $25.75.\n\nAccording to the analyst, Solana\u2019s potential surge is expected to be prompted by Ethereum\u2018s Cancun upgrade, which is poised to enhance the scalability of the leading innovative contract platform.\n\nRepresentation of the Ethereum cryptocurrency. According to Mullarney, Solana\u2019s potential surge is expected to be prompted by Ethereum\u2019s Cancun upgrade. (JAKUB PORZYCKI/GETTY IMAGES)\n\nMullarney refered to a forecast by Blofin, a crypto-financial services firm, predicting that Ethereum could rise to $9,700 after the update.\n\n\u201cPer Blofin, they predict that after the Cancun upgrade of Ethereum, the price could exceed $9,700 per ETH in the first quarter of 2024. And of course, that is their most optimistic case,\u201d Mullarney said in the video.\n\n\u201cThe next question is always, if Ethereum goes to $9,700, what\u2019s the price of Solana? I calculated it for you. It will be at least $250 if ETH hits $9,700. Remember $9,700 from where it is now is over a 5x, and, of course, Solana goes up faster than ETH will at that time,\u201d the InvestAnswers host added.\n\nAccording to Mullarney, although Ethereum could potentially reach $9,700, he doesn\u2019t anticipate the surge happening in the coming months. Instead, he believes it may occur during the bull run, possibly in early 2025, rather than the first quarter of 2024.\n\nRegarding Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Mullarney reaffirmed his previous prediction that the flagship cryptocurrency could increase by over 40% from its current levels by early next year.\n\n\u201cAs I mentioned several times a few months ago, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Bitcoin reached a $42,000 target somewhere between January and April of 2024,\u201d he said.\n\nSolana is a rapidly emerging cryptocurrency and blockchain platform that has gained substantial attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko, it seeks to address the scalability issues plaguing other blockchain networks, aiming to process over 65,000 transactions per second, thanks to its innovative proof-of-history and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. Solana\u2019s speed and low fees have made it an attractive choice for developers and users alike.\n\nIts native token, SOL, powers the ecosystem, facilitating transactions, staking, and governing the network. The platform hosts numerous DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and decentralized exchanges, fostering a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem.\n\nProduced in association with Benzinga\n\nEdited by Arnab Nandy"

        "content": "The Disco Biscuits Conclude West Coast Tour with Sold-Out Show at Belly Up Tavern\n\nPhoto by Tara Gracer\n\nOver the weekend, the Disco Biscuits concluded their highly anticipated West Coast tour with a triumphant sold-out performance at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, Calif. The tour, the band\u2019s first on the West Coast in over a decade, left devoted Biscuits fans buzzing with excitement, declaring it one of the best runs of music from the trance/rock fusion ensemble in years.\n\nOver the course of 14 shows, the Disco Biscuits delivered an incredible musical journey, leaving fans mesmerized by their jams equipped with seamless transitions. The camaraderie among band members was also palpable as they effortlessly communicated on stage, crafting intricate musical landscapes that captivated their devoted fanbase.\n\nBass guitarist Marc Brownstein expressed his delight at the tour\u2019s success, stating, \u201cHaving 14 shows in a row really allowed us to develop things in a way we haven\u2019t in two decades. We have developed a little language on stage, allowing us to communicate nearly telepathically during our jams. We feel like we\u2019re as good of a band as we\u2019ve ever been and we can\u2019t wait to keep it going into our fall tour and of course, BISCOLAND.\u201d\n\nThe final show in Solana Beach was a tour de force of musical prowess, featuring two 5-song sets that showcased both new tracks and beloved classics. The band masterfully weaved their newer songs, like \u201cPhotograph,\u201d into lengthy improvisational journeys, much to the delight of the audience. The setlist included crowd favorites such as \u201cVoices Insane,\u201d \u201cTourists (Rocket Ship),\u201d \u201cShocked,\u201d and a cover of Dead Or Alive\u2019s dance classic \u201cYou Spin Me Round (Like a Record),\u201d which brought the night to an exhilarating close.\n\nThroughout the tour, the Disco Biscuits delivered several standout performances, including a monumental 34-minute \u201cVoices Insane\u201d jam in Montana and a captivating 30-minute \u201cI-Man\u201d in Bend, Ore. The Pacific Northwest was treated to more awe-inspiring improvisations, with a 32-minute \u201cMindless Dribble\u201d in Portland, Ore., and a memorable rendition of fan-favorite \u201cNughuffer\u201d in Seattle.\n\nNotably, the Disco Biscuits\u2019 West Coast tour saw larger crowds than ever before, with their Los Angeles show at The Roxy Theatre selling out within days of tickets being released. The band rewarded their fervent fans with an unforgettable performance, including an explosive version of their newer track, \u201cThe Wormhole,\u201d and a non-stop dance party during the second set.\n\nAs the West Coast tour comes to a close, the Disco Biscuits have an array of upcoming events, including the Catskill Mountain Jubilee performance and their inaugural BISCOLAND festival in Lafayette, N.Y.\n\nThe two-day festival will take place at Wonderland Forest and feature an impressive lineup of jam, jamtronica, and electronic music artists, with the Disco Biscuits and Lotus headlining the event. The festival will also include performances from Emancipator, Papadosio, Opiuo, Sunsquabi, The Floozies, Eggy, Maddy O\u2019Neal, Space Bacon, and a special Spaga Plays Dead set by the Disco Biscuits\u2019 member Aron Magner."

        "title": "Frenetic Shooter 'Ev.io' Lets You Earn Solana While Fragging Enemies - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEv.io is a free-to-play, web-based shooter that recalls first-person shooter pioneers like Quake and Unreal Tournament\u2014but this one lets users earn cryptocurrency for playing, too.\n\nSet in a futuristic world, your character is equipped with a gun of your choice and a melee weapon. You have the option of fighting enemies in a free-for-all deathmatch or battling it out in teams, plus you can dip into a sniper shotgun mode or a survival mode akin to the popular Call of Duty \u201cZombies\u201d experience.\n\nIn all of the available modes, you can pick up unique weapons or health boosts from the ground. The special weapons are a lot of fun to use and have sourced some of my favorite moments in the game. There's something so gratifying about shooting someone with a rocket launcher across the map.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou can also select a range of abilities and equipment before entering a game. In a fairly limited skill tree, you have the option to activate the abilities to teleport, triple jump, and more.\n\nA personal favorite is the impulse grenade that can launch any unlucky opponent clear across the map. This makes for a lot of fun outplays and cool in-game moments\u2014and sure enough, launching myself into the air and sniping someone just feels awesome.\n\nThat said, impulse grenades, teleporting, and other in-game movement controls can make the game difficult to pick up at first. Not only do you need to spend time learning how to use these options effectively, but it also means that hitting your enemy is more difficult.\n\nVery rarely will you encounter someone standing still, and with the character models being so skinny, this can be tough to adjust to at first. For this reason, trip wires and mines are super useful. You can put them in a high-traffic area and play around them, luring your enemies into an explosive outcome or using them to protect your own back.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn NFT boost\n\nAfter purchasing an optional Ev.io NFT on Solana and equipping it in-game, you're able to earn an in-game currency called \"e.\u201d The amount of e you earn is based on your in-game score, which is primarily based on the number of kills you get. You can also earn e from events, daily quests, clan wars, and more.\n\nOnce you have 10,000 e, you are able to convert it to Solana (SOL) and then you can opt to cash out for fiat currency at an exchange. A developer from the Ev.io team on Discord told Decrypt that the conversion rate varies, but is approximately $1 worth of SOL per 2,000 \u201ce\u201d earned as of this writing.\n\nI purchased the Bonk character\u2014named for the BONK cryptocurrency, itself inspired by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu\u2014for around $22 worth of SOL. Not only did this make me stand out and feel cool in-game, but the play-to-earn element really intensified the experience for me. I felt like I was a hitman; every kill counted to slowly earn back the money I'd put down.\n\nAfter an hour of gaming\u2014only topping the leaderboard once\u2014I earned 124 e. That\u2019s only worth about six cents worth of SOL when converted, so it's clear that events, quests, and clan wars should be your main form of attack if you plan to make your money back.\n\nFamiliarity sets in\n\nDespite Ev.io\u2019s great foundations, it feels like there is a lack of variety that keeps you wanting to boot up the game over and over again. The weapon meta feels fairly stale, as everyone uses the auto rifle. Sometimes I'd switch it up and use the laser rifle for fun, but the other default weapons didn't seem to get much use.\n\nEqually, the difference between the free-for-all and team deathmatch wasn't very apparent. It doesn't feel like teamwork is really important, meaning both game modes have a similar feel. You could drop into the sniper shotgun mode, but you can't earn the e currency there\u2014and ultimately, it comes across as a restrictive riff on the free-for-all mode.\n\nA screenshot from Ev.io. Image: Decrypt\n\nFor this reason, the Zombies-like survival mode has an important place in the game to take a break from the online deathmatch grind.\n\nThe variety of Ev.io\u2019s maps is pretty impressive. They all have unique color schemes with fun lines of sight and places to launch. Rarely do the maps fall into the typical three-lane structure a lot of shooters rely on. And there's not a map that I groan at when it pops up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEv.io's graphics are very basic in order to optimize the game for all desktop devices. That said, while simplistic, the art style is consistent with its futuristic theme, opting for sleek lines and neon colors\u2014giving a \u201cTron\u201d vibe all the while.\n\nOverall, Ev.io is a great option amongst crypto and NFT games, especially considering that it is free-to-play and available for anyone to play in a web browser. The emphasis on movement makes it fun to traverse the map, while adding a unique skill curve to entering the game.\n\nThat said, after a few hours playing the game, it can get a bit repetitive with a lack of variety in the weapon meta and game modes. That\u2019s why the play-to-earn element is a key selling point for the game's longevity. With repetitive game modes, the desire to get better at the game to earn more in-game currency is crucial.\n\nIf you're looking for a play-to-earn game with a focus on skill and rewards for those who wield the NFTs, then Ev.io might be the game for you."
