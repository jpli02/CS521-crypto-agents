        "content": "Solana (SOL) is the native coin of the Solana open-source project, which uses blockchain technology to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. It is currently trading at $22.71, with a market cap of $8,952,029,229, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nSOL hasn\u2019t had a price of over $100 in over a year. Additionally, it has hovered over the same $25 average throughout 2023. Some investors wonder if SOL will ever reach that $100 price range again. Is it possible that SOL can reach $100 by the end of 2023?\n\nSource: Outlook India\n\nCan Solana (SOL) Reach $100 This Year?\n\nWhile nothing is impossible, it is very unlikely that within the next few months, we\u2019ll see SOL escape its current bearish phase.\n\nSince the FTX crisis at the end of last year, Solana has been negatively impacted and is now stuck around the $20 mark, after reaching as high as $36.77 in November. April saw signs of improvement for SOL, seeing it rally up $4 in an otherwise low month. However, this is nowhere close to signifying a $100 bull run is coming soon.\n\nThe Solana blockchain platform will need to continue growing in adoption in order to build any promise for its coin. Investors are eyeing Solana\u2019s slow but steady growth in 2023, which can be a positive sign for SOL. With a green market across the cryptocurrency and a shortening supply, there is potential growth for Solana\u2019s native coin.\n\nIn conclusion, while it\u2019s unlikely that SOL will reach $100 again by the end of the year, it can\u2019t be ruled out. Coins like PEPE with their rapid growth in a matter of weeks, are proof that anything is possible in the crypto market."

        "title": "The Sui NFT Scene Already Has Early Buzz\u2014Will It Last? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSince the Sui blockchain\u2019s mainnet launch on Wednesday, an active NFT community is already taking root, with marketplaces dropping projects that have sold out and collectively yielded hundreds of thousands\u2019 of dollars worth of trades\u2014albeit with some early hitches.\n\nThe Mysten Labs-developed layer-1 blockchain has been billed a \u201cSolana killer\u201d by some, but Solana boasts one of the liveliest NFT markets around, second only to Ethereum. Sui is pulling in traders, but it\u2019s still too early to tell whether the network will support a thriving space or see the initial hype cool quickly as it did on networks like Aptos and Near.\n\nThursday\u2019s drop of Fuddies, a set of 10,000 Sui profile pictures (PFPs) depicting cartoonish owls in various poses and styles, has been the biggest drop thus far. But the marketplace that hosted the drop faced technical problems following the mint, yielding backlash from collectors as well as NFT traders and Web3 builders on competing blockchain networks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFuddies debuted on upstart marketplace Clutchy\u2014which Mysten Labs has helped to promote\u2014and offered its NFTs for 95 SUI (about $125) to users added to a pre-launch allowlist. Afterwards, the public sale began with a Dutch auction format, with the initial price of 300 SUI (about $395) gradually dropping, hitting 150 SUI (nearly $200) before selling out.\n\nBuyers who hoped to flip the Fuddies NFTs for a quick profit were quickly frustrated, however, when Clutchy\u2019s secondary marketplace failed to work as intended.\n\nTo all marketplaces on SUI Feel free to DM me for a Airtable or Google Sheets NFT marketplace template, free of charge \u2014 SheetFu (@ChartFuMonkey) May 4, 2023\n\nSome Ethereum and Solana NFT collectors took the opportunity to call out the new rival\u2019s marketplace for encountering technical difficulties. Clutchy had already delayed its planned Wednesday NFT mints after facing issues after the Sui mainnet launch.\n\nBefore long, however, the secondary marketplace started working\u2014and so far, Clutchy reports some 605,000 SUI (about $792,500) worth of trading for Fuddies in about 24 hours. As the project creators noted on Twitter, that\u2019s more than the total amount of NFT trading seen on Ethereum scaling network Polygon during the same span, per data from CryptoSlam.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFuddies just passed the entirety of @0xPolygonLabs in 24 Hour sales volume and @SuiNetwork didn't even have to pay us to launch on their chain pic.twitter.com/DhvBwpaMNs \u2014 Fuddies (@FuddiesNFT) May 5, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s far and away the biggest NFT project on Sui so far, however. Another NFT project that minted on Clutchy yesterday and sold out, the sushi-themed Suishi, has only notched about 10,900 SUI (about $14,300) worth of secondary trades since the mint.\n\nClutchy isn\u2019t the only Sui NFT marketplace that\u2019s live, however. Souffl3, a marketplace that started life on Aptos last fall, has expanded to Sui as well\u2014but its top project so far hasn\u2019t been a sales sensation. The biggest Sui project on Souffl3 is Sui Trident, which has stacked up just under $65,000 worth of trades in the last 24 hours.\n\nProjects are launching and selling out, however, with drops like Fuddies and Suishi both selling through on Clutchy, and Depthos and Sui G00dies selling through. On the downside, however, the current price floor\u2014that is, the price of the cheapest-listed NFT in the project\u2014has fallen below the public mint price, to 118 SUI (about $155).\n\nAhead of the mainnet launch, Clutchy founder and CEO Jacob \u201cDizzy Lizzy\u201d Lawless told Decrypt that the marketplace had seen \u201ctons of interest from influencers, investors, creators and onlookers.\u201d\n\nGiven the gold rush seen on Ethereum, Solana, and recently with Bitcoin Ordinals when the earliest NFTs on each platform shot up in value, there\u2019s always an eagerness among creators to be first out the gate with projects on a new chain. Likewise, savvy collectors try to snatch up assets that will have early provenance, which could boost its value in the future.\n\nWe saw that most recently with the debut of Aptos last October, which saw a surge in trading volume that corresponded with a dip in Solana NFT sales. Like Sui, Aptos is built around the Move programming language, so there are commonalities\u2014and it helps explain why Souffl3, for example, bridged over to Sui and bills itself as the \u201cNFT market on Move.\u201d\n\nAptos NFT fever calmed quickly, but the initial buzz was massive. The Aptos Monkeys NFT project, for example, yielded about $2.3 million worth of trading volume in about 24 hours in October, just over a week after the Aptos mainnet went live. Sui has yet to match that kind of peak, but it\u2019s only been a couple of days since the mainnet rollout.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmongst Sui creators, there\u2019s excitement over the chain\u2019s ability to enable more advanced capabilities than some other chains, such as dynamic NFTs that update in real time. There\u2019s an obvious benefit for blockchain-based video games, for example, with weapons or armor that improve over time, potentially becoming more useful or valuable in the process.\n\nAnd gaming may ultimately prove to be one of the biggest drivers of NFT momentum on Sui, with a slate of notable early titles like the Overwatch-esque hero shooter Bushi, a Walking Dead game, and tank game Panzerdogs (a Solana transplant) due out in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI feel like there's still a lot of interesting experimentation going on, culminating in another wave of NFT and dapp innovation,\u201d pseudonymous Web3 project advisor Dabblerer told Decrypt. \u201cThe launches are inspired by lessons learned by early movers with some different takes.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to other potential NFT use cases on the horizon for Sui, including a project called Sui Name Service (SuiNS). It\u2019s similar in approach to the popular Ethereum Name Service (ENS), but with domain names tied both to NFTs as well as smart contracts (which hold the code that powers decentralized apps), which Dabblerer suggested would let users \u201cinteract with more trust and security.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udf08Welcome to the world of SuiFrens!\u2728 SuiFrens are a demonstration of Sui Move capabilities, bringing to life the composability, extensibility, and dynamism of digital assets on @SuiNetwork. \ud83d\udc49https://t.co/ov3WR1zeoV\ud83d\udc48#BuildOnSui pic.twitter.com/Pys3cKyok5 \u2014 Mysten Labs (@Mysten_Labs) May 3, 2023\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons we decided to build on Sui [is] because its tech provides a platform for innovation,\u201d Clutchy\u2019s Lawless said. He added that the Move language \u201csignificantly lowers the boundaries for creators to innovate through dynamic NFTs,\u201d potentially unlocking more types of use cases and compelling apps and experiences.\n\nJust a couple days into the Sui mainnet launch, however, such innovative projects and applications could still be far off on the horizon. For now, the projects launching this week mostly look and feel like derivative knockoffs of collections on other chains.\n\nStill, a small but engaged community flipping hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of PFPs is something\u2014and we\u2019ll see whether the early buzz grows into something that can put a real scare into competing NFT ecosystems.\n\nAD\n\nAD"
