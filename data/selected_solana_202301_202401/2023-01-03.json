        "content": "Last week, Solana (SOL) fell to its lowest level since February 2021. But its price has risen over 12% in the past 24 hours on Tuesday after almost nine days of consecutive losses that brought its price to around $8 on Friday.\n\nAmid Solana\u2019s movement, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap \u2014 Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 both shifted less than 1% in the past 24 hours, showing some stability.\n\nSolana has been volatile for a number of reasons in recent weeks, including one of its most prominent backers being the now-disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and top NFT projects planning to leave its blockchain.\n\nBut some are crediting the recent spike to interest from Solana community members in Bonk (BONK), a new meme token that airdropped about 50% of its 56 trillion token supply to users last week. Airdropping is when a cryptocurrency sends a free supply of its token to a number of crypto wallets in a way to gain users or reward loyal community members.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to reward everyone that made #Solana what it is today,\u201d the Solana-focused dog coin tweeted about a month ago before gaining traction.\n\nAbout 20% of Bonk\u2019s total airdrop supply went to Solana NFT collections, which consisted of almost 300,000 individual NFTs. The Shiba Inu\u2013themed cryptocurrency has risen about 96% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nEven some major Solana projects have considered (or did) adopting the newly launched token from large decentralized exchanges like Orca to NFT markets like Magic Eden.\n\nWhile Bonk gains steam, it\u2019s highly likely that it will have a similar fate to other meme or dog-focused crypto tokens that often see a pump, followed by a steep dump and little to no recovery. In the meantime, however, it has helped the Solana ecosystem gain momentum in a time when many crypto players saw it as a goner.\n\nAs there has been some slight recovery for Solana, its future remains uncertain even amid its dog coin\u2013related hype. As of today, Solana has dropped from being the fifth-largest token in early November to the 15th largest and is the number one trending cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap."

        "title": "SOL Soars 36% As Bonk Memecoin Becomes First Hit of 2023 - The Defiant - DeFi News",
        "content": "NFT Marketplace Magic Eden Generated Record Volume In December\n\nBy: Owen Fernau \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi\n\nDays after dipping below $10 for the first time in almost two years, the Solana blockchain\u2019s SOL token jumped over 18% on Jan. 3.\n\nThe move came after the token underperformed competing Layer 1s like ETH, BNB, and others earlier in the week \u2014 SOL is now up 36.5% on the week, according to The Defiant Terminal.\n\nBONK Token\n\nA surge of interest in BONK, a new meme coin, has coincided with SOL\u2019s upward trajectory. BONK is a meme token that was airdropped to participants in the Solana ecosystem on Dec. 24, which has quickly ascended to a $100M-plus market capitalization.\n\n\u201cI think the launch of something like BONK has really just been something that the community is excited about and getting behind,\u201d Austin Federa, head of strategy and communications at the Solana Foundation, told The Defiant. Federa added that people were simply having fun with BONK. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a lot of fun in crypto in the last few months,\u201d he said.\n\nTransactions featuring BONK have spiked from nearly non-existent to an hourly high of over 88,400 on Jan. 3, according to a Dune Analytics query.\n\nBONK Transactions\n\nThe team behind BONK is positioning the token as the \u201cfirst dog coin for the Solana ecosystem.\u201d Despite their typically ambiguous utility, canine coins have been surprisingly successful \u2014 the most recognizable in the category is Dogecoin, which commands a market cap of nearly $10B.\n\nBONK\u2019s website also differentiates the token from what it calls \u201ctoxic \u2018Alameda\u2019 tokenomics.\u201d The now-bankrupt Alameda Research, the sister hedge fund to FTX, was infamous for investing in Solana tokens with low circulating, but high total supplies. Colloquially, these tokens were known as \u201clow float high FDV (fully diluted value)\u201d tokens, or simply \u201cSam Coins.\u201d\n\nMachine Learning Best Way to Defend Web3 From Exploits Bedeviled by Hacks and Exploits Web3 Should Tap ML to Protect Its Turf \u2014 Here's How\n\nThis dynamic made it relatively easy to move prices higher because of the low liquidity. Firms like Alameda, which received illiquid tokens as part of venture rounds, could then sell the inflated assets to retail investors as they unlocked in line with the tokens\u2019 vesting schedule.\n\nThat BONK has emerged in opposition to the low-float, high-FDV design shows a definitive thrust by the Solana community to move beyond its association with Alameda Research and FTX.\n\nThere\u2019s a long way to go. The total value locked in Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem dropped 70% in just 10 days after FTX collapsed.\n\nStill, the fact that the blockchain ecosystem isn\u2019t simply rolling over and dying is surely a welcome sign to those who remain wholly committed to Solana.\n\nAlameda Holdings\n\nFedera added that many of the Solana-related holdings of Alameda and FTX are going to be tied up in the firms\u2019 Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure, meaning that they aren\u2019t in imminent danger of being sold on the open market.\n\nSolana has also picked up a show of support from Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder.\n\nSolana NFT Volumes Surge\n\nMagic Eden, the largest NFT marketplace on Solana, has also been gaining momentum. Jack Lu, the CEO and co-founder of Magic Eden, told The Defiant that the marketplace generated record sales volumes of over 8M SOL in December. He cited launches by major brands like Toys\u2019R\u2019Us and Aston Martin as catalysts for the increased volume.\n\n30-day Volume on Magic Eden in SOL. Source. Dune\n\n\u201cThe fact that we were able to achieve record trading volumes in spite of market conditions signals that the market shares our belief that Solana is still strong,\u201d Lu said.\n\nBONK may also be feeding into the excitement around Solana\u2019s NFT ecosystem \u2014 the project airdropped 20% of its supply to holders of Solana NFTs.\n\nDeGods Migration\n\nThe airdrop may have softened the blow from two major Solana NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, announcing that they would move to Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, respectively. In apparent retaliation, the BONKS team burned the tokens previously allocated to DeGods\u2019 holders.\n\nLooking forward, Federa is excited about a new implementation of a Solana validator called Firedancer, which The Defiant reported on in August. He added that while people understand that Firedancer is a new client built with a different programming language, C++, they don\u2019t understand the advantages of building something a second time.\n\nFiredancer\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like every time you build a piece of software, or you remodel a house, you finish the thing, and you\u2019re like, damn, if we knew where we were going at the start, we probably could have done X or Y or Z differently,\u201d Federa said. \u201cSo what they\u2019re doing is actually a rebuild of the codebase based on the current state of the Solana network.\u201d\n\nHe listed increased performance in terms of speed as well the security stemming from the redundancy of a second validator implementation as the two high-level advantages of Firedancer.\n\nFedera went on to say that the Solana Foundation remains fully committed to the project\u2019s vision. \u201cThe core fundamental thesis of the network remains the same, which is [that] if you build the fastest, most performant infrastructure in one global state, developers can build all sorts of applications they can\u2019t build anywhere else on Solana.\u201d"
