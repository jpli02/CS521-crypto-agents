A first attempt was abandoned when validators realized they picked the wrong point at which to restart, further lengthening the delay."

        "title": "As bicycle, e-bike collisions rise in coastal North County, local officials discuss safety options - Del Mar Times",
        "content": "With an uptick in bicycle collisions and soaring e-bike usage, local officials in coastal North County are considering their options to improve safety.\n\nWith bicycle collisions on the rise in coastal North County, coinciding with the burgeoning popularity of e-bikes, local leaders are considering ordinances and other options to make the roads safer.\n\nThe total number of traffic collisions recorded by the San Diego County Sheriff on local roads in Del Mar, Solana Beach and Encinitas decreased slightly each year from 2018-22 (the data excludes freeway collisions that are recorded by the California Highway Patrol). The only exception was in 2020, when there was a much larger dip in collisions due to decreased traffic in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Collisions rose the following year before continuing their overall decrease in 2022.\n\nBut within that data, collisions involving regular bicycles and e-bikes increased nearly 50% when comparing 2018 to 2022. Most of those collisions are in Encinitas. Del Mar and Solana Beach, the two smallest cities in the county, each accounted for fewer than 10 collisions involving bicycles per year from that five-year period.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, collisions that included a bicycle or e-bike ticked up to a little more than one per week, and accounted for about 17% of total collisions \u2014 up from 10% five years prior.\n\nThose bicycle collisions have resulted in 232 injuries to all parties involved, as well as three fatalities.\n\nA heatmap of where collisions involving bicycles and e-bikes have taken place in Encinitas, Solana Beach and Del Mar, based on 235 collisions recorded by the San Diego County Sheriff from 2018-22. (Luke Harold)\n\nOver the past few years, council members and parents have been particularly concerned about e-bike usage. The sheriff does not specifically track e-bike collisions; all collisions involving any type of bicycle are classified the same way. But the surge in bicycle collisions coincides with the increase in e-bikes on the roads.\n\nE-bikes do have a lot of support among local government officials and the general public for their health and environmental benefits. But with assisted speeds of up to 20 mph on Class 1 and 2 e-bikes and 28 mph on Class 3, they also have their own set of public safety concerns.\n\nDel Mar, Solana Beach and Encinitas are all considering local ordinances to regulate e-bike usage. E-bikes, like regular bicycles, are currently subject to the same traffic laws as automobiles. Unlike cars, there are few prerequisites and safety requirements to operate an e-bike.\n\nThe specifics of their potential laws are to be determined, but cracking down on unsafe offroad usage has been a common refrain throughout North County.\n\nIn Del Mar, city leaders want to consider their options for e-bike regulation before the end of this fiscal year in June. Mayor Tracy Martinez said she often uses an e-bike, but has heard a lot from residents about children who ride them without helmets, on the sidewalks and with no regard for stop signs.\n\n\u201cI think some regulations are really necessary and I hope the council supports that,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had kids riding on the beach on e-bikes, which is not allowed, and the lifeguards are aware of that. But we don\u2019t have any guidelines or rules yet.\u201d\n\nDel Mar Municipal Code prohibits motorized vehicles, including e-bikes, but makes an exception if the rider doesn\u2019t use the pedal assist or motor.\n\nErica Davis, who lives in Del Mar, said her 6-year-old son was building a sandcastle at Torrey Pines State Beach last summer when an older child on an e-bike crashed into him. She said his injuries included abrasions throughout his body and a laceration on his chin that required stitches. A state parks spokesperson said that as of August 2021, e-bikes are not allowed at Torrey Pines State Beach or Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve.\n\n\u201cThat for me has been the hardest thing,\u201d Davis said, \u201cis finding a safe place outside where I feel like I can let my kids roam and run and not have to worry about them getting hit by a bike, especially a young kid on an e-bike who really doesn\u2019t have experience being able to predict what people will do.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Get the Del Mar Times in your inbox Top stories from Carmel Valley, Del Mar and Solana Beach every Friday for free. Enter email address Sign Me Up You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Del Mar Times.\n\nSolana Beach resident Karl Rudnick, an instructor with the League of American Bicyclists who teaches e-bike safety classes for adults, said there\u2019s a need for more education.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve essentially given 20 mph electric motorcycles to 12-year-olds,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even get on a motorcycle without a driver\u2019s license.\u201d\n\nBut he added that some of the children he sees on the road who ride their e-bikes frequently are among the safest riders, while plenty of adult riders also break traffic laws and shirk best safety practices.\n\n\u201cThere are still some bad riders out there, but there are some bad drivers out there too,\u201d said Rudnick, a founder of BikeWalkSolana.\n\nHelmet enforcement among children has been a particular focus for the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better,\u201d said Deputy David Drake, from the North Coastal Station. \u201cThe kids are definitely wearing their helmets. They could do a better job of strapping their helmets. But I think that\u2019s definitely improved because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been focusing on.\u201d\n\nChildren who are cited are also given the option to take a California Highway Patrol online safety course to avoid traffic court.\n\nDrake was one of several city and school leaders who attended a February School District Liaison Committee meeting in Encinitas. The discussion included potential state legislation to provide some uniformity in e-bike policy, as opposed to the current patchwork of regulations by cities, school districts and other local officials.\n\n\u201cEncinitas should be a nationwide leader in bike safety, bike education and promotion of bikes as a means of transportation,\u201d Encinitas City Councilmember Kellie Hinze said.\n\nSolana Beach Mayor Lesa Heebner said the parameters of a local ordinance, if the City Council goes that route, are \u201copen for discussion at this point.\u201d She mentioned a possible licensing requirement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a phase, I think it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d Heebner said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take a look at the implications of all this, because there are some really wonderful benefits that come from it.\u201d"
