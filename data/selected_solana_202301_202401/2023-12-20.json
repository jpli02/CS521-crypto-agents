        "content": "Trezor Wallet Now Supports Solana and SPL Tokens\n\nTrezor, a leading manufacturer of web3 hardware wallets, has expanded its support to include two new tokens: Solana (SOL) and Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens. The company announced that both the Trezor Model T and Safe 3 hardware wallets now support SOL and SPL tokens.\n\nThe Trezor Safe 3, priced at $79, features a special chip for enhanced security, while the Model T offers a touchscreen interface and retails for $179. Both devices support over 8,000 coins and tokens, allowing users to securely send, receive, and trade their digital assets.\n\nSOL is the native token of the Solana blockchain, a high-performance blockchain known for its fast transaction speeds and low fees. SPL is the token standard on Solana, similar to Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard.\n\nTrezor's support for SOL and SPL tokens comes at an opportune time as Solana has witnessed a resurgence in interest in recent months. Both trading activity and search engine searches for Solana have surged significantly. SOL rallied by an impressive 266.8% since early October, when it traded around $22.\n\nTrezor's decision to add support for SOL and SPL tokens also comes at a time when Ledger, another popular hardware wallet, was hit by an exploit on its Ledger Connect Kit, which connects websites to wallets. This has compromised many popular decentralized apps and caused over $600,000 to be drained.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Solana flips XRP once more, closes in on Ethereum - Blockworks",
        "content": "Solana\u2019s native asset SOL flipped XRP this morning to again become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nAfter gaining more than 700% since its market bottomed out at the end of last year, SOL is now valued at nearly $34 billion. XRP and SOL trail only binance coin (BNB), tether (USDT), ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThis makes SOL one of the best performing top-100 cryptocurrencies of 2023. XRP, meanwhile, has only made about 80% \u2014 about the same as ether \u2014 but both have underperformed against bitcoin this year.\n\nXRP must still deal with a jury trial in Ripple\u2019s long-running US Securities and Exchange Commission saga. A federal court in July found the firm\u2019s programmatic sales to retail investors through crypto exchanges and other platforms didn\u2019t amount to securities, while direct sales to institutional investors did.\n\nRead more: Judge rules in SEC case vs Ripple\n\nThe trial, set for next spring, should finally determine to what extent Ripple Labs is culpable for flouting US securities laws, after the SEC dropped its charges against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen in October. A settlement in the meantime is still possible.\n\nWhile Solana spent most of the third quarter of 2021 \u2014 peak bull market \u2014 ahead of XRP and a top-five coin behind tether, its more recent overperformance can in part be explained by how severely it crashed around the FTX debacle last November.\n\nClick play to watch Solana recover from its crash last year\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was invested heavily in projects across the Solana space, including SOL itself, and the crypto crashed by nearly two-thirds in three days when the market lost faith in cryptocurrencies orbiting the FTX co-founder. BTC and ETH meanwhile took only a 20% hit.\n\nSolana was a top-10 token before FTX\u2019s downfall, worth about half as much as XRP. In the months after, Solana ranked at the tail end of the top 20, behind polkadot (DOT), tron (TRX) and memecoin shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nNever underestimate the power of dog coins\n\nSolana has been busy catching up all year, propelled in part by a commitment from its developers to shake the network\u2019s association with Bankman-Fried, whose entities still hold claim to nearly $2 billion in SOL at current prices to be unlocked over the next few years.\n\nThe network boasts much of the same utility as smart contract-enabled blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, Avalanche and BNB Chain, albeit with its own unique brand of consensus, technology and tokenomics developed by San Francisco-based Solana Labs.\n\nApps and tokens run atop Solana, including decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and NFT marketplaces.\n\nSolana\u2019s overall dominance, which measures how much of the entire market is SOL, is at 2.13%, 0.6 percentage points lower than its November 2021 record.\n\nHype around new Solana-centric projects has helped inspire a certain Solanaissance. BONK, the network\u2019s resident dog coin, has seen its price multiply 100 times over the past two months \u2014 even after a healthy 50% correction this week.\n\nRead more: BONK\u2019s price pumped harder around Coinbase listing than any other crypto this year\n\nBONK mania even led to significant markups for Solana-branded smartphones upon realization that each one had been preloaded with 30 million BONK ($550) \u2014 about the same as the retail value of the device.\n\nElsewhere, the liquid staking protocol Jito airdropped $165 million worth of its new token, JTO, to its users earlier this month. Traders pushed the price of JTO higher following the distribution, with the whole process adding about $300 million in market value to the Solana ecosystem.\n\nLoading Tweet.. BONK and Jito are combining forces to seed Solana users with Christmas cheer\n\nThe anticipation of further airdrops scaled to Solana activity has since helped drive on-chain volumes to yearly highs.\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) across its network is also up, now at $1 billion compared to $300 million in September.\n\nAlthough, that jump is mostly attributed to the rising price of SOL; there\u2019s currently 14 million SOL locked on the network right now, one-third less than the 21 million SOL staked at the start of the year, and 25% less than in September.\n\nSolana almost closer than ever to flipping Ethereum\n\nIn any case, now that SOL seems set to stay ahead of XRP, some might wonder how far away it is from eclipsing BNB. The token is the native asset for Binance\u2019s blockchain network BNB Chain, and Binance users can also use it to cover trading fees and participation in initial coin offerings and the like.\n\nBNB faces its own set of challenges due to Binance\u2019s run-in with US regulators, which has resulted in mammoth fines, a years-long financial surveillance mandate and the exit of co-founder Changpeng Zhao as CEO.\n\nRead more: Binance says the SEC can\u2019t use DOJ plea deals as proof of guilt\n\nTurns out, outside of the last bull market\u2019s peak in late 2021, solana has never been closer to flipping BNB in their shared history. BNB\u2019s market cap is now just 20% more than SOL\u2019s, down drastically from 300% higher only three months ago.\n\nThe gap between Solana and Ethereum is still a long way off completely closing\n\nSolana\u2019s hopes of flipping Ethereum seem far less realistic right now. But there is progress: Ethereum\u2019s market value is now about 700% more than Solana\u2019s, its lowest point since peak bull market in 2021.\n\nETH was worth nearly 40 times more than Solana at the start of the year.\n\nSOL would still need to hit a price equal to more than twice its current all-time high, multiplying eight times to $625, to reach ETH\u2019s current valuation. Ethereum, of course, would have to stagnate the entire time.\n\nSo, if Solana flipping Ethereum were to happen at all, it would likely take multiple bull and bear cycles for Solana to properly narrow the gap.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
