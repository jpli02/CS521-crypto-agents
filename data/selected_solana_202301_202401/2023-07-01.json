        "content": "Anatoly Yakovenlo is a Russian computer engineer, who authored the Solana white paper. Since he was five, he has had an interest in computers. Later, he moved to the United States in the 1990s where earned a degree in computer science. He moved to California and worked at Qualcomm for nearly 12 years where he led the development of operating systems. He also worked in Mesosphere and Dropbox where he led the development of distributed systems.\n\nAt the end of 2017, Yakovenko co-founded the Solana project. In 2021 when developers were trying to enhance Ethereum for slow transaction speed and high fees, Solana token (SOL) had jumped to gain popularity. In September 2021, it fell victim to a network overload while attempting to process 400,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe DDoS attack occurred on the decentralized exchange Raydium which hampered the network for 18 hours. Yakovenko had to call on Solana\u2019s validator to restart the network. This raised some questions to its level of decentralization.\n\nBut, Yakovenko had taken this as a chance to show Solana\u2019s strength. He said this shows Solana\u2019s power that the network was down for less than 24 hours. He stated that he views Solana as more of a complement to the world\u2019s second largest crypto. It has the ability of performing 65,000 transactions per second. In December 2021, an official announcement was made that Solana is carbon neutral.\n\nInvestments of Anatoly Yakovenko Along With Solana\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, creator of Solana has made 16 investments. Some organizations in which he invested are Credibly Neutral, Tensor, Sec3, Elusiv, Eclipse, Jito Labs etc. He has made 8 number of Partner Investments.\n\nHe released the whitepaper of Solana in 2017, announcing it is not a regular blockchain, and that it will work on novel consensus mechanisms. In 2017, Ethereum and Bitcoin are prominent blockchains in 2017, and both are facing the same problem of being slow. Yakovenko\u2019s goal was to create a blockchain, faster in terms of transaction speed, but he found that it is impossible with consensus mechanisms. Both Proof of Stake and Proof of Work took a lot of time. This is why he decided to create another consensus mechanism that is Proof of History which would be used with Proof of Stake.\n\nCurrent Market Analysis of Solana\n\nThe Solana price today is $18.15 with a 24-hour trading volume of $924,722,999. It has a market cap of $7,333,792,284 and a circulating supply of 400,265,486 SOL.\n\nWeekly analysis shows that on 24 June 2023, it had a price of $17.13, while it had a volume of $424.88M while this value goes up to price $ 18.31 and volume $926.13M on 1 July 2023.\n\nSource: coinmarketcap\n\nSummary\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko is determined to lead the company. The main project Solana seems to be working on right now is the Web 3.0 phone, which is called the Saga phone. Solana is a highly functional open source project. It is a permission-less technology that provides decentralized finance solutions.\n\nProof of History consensus adds a unique quality to Solana. It allows greater usability and scalability. With lightning fast transactions, Solana has attracted a lot of institutions."

        "content": "Solana and Cardano Expected to be Replaced in Portfolios by InQubeta as AI Takes Over\n\nDisclaimer: The text below is an advertorial article that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content.\n\nDisclaimer: The text below is a press release that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content.\n\nAn increasing number of Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) investors are swapping their holdings for InQubeta (QUBE) tokens as its presale remains one of the hottest topics in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe QUBE platform provides more utility than both projects combined, bringing AI startups that need funding together with investors who might not have entry to traditional investment channels.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s innovative approach to investing sends more funds into the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, paving the way for more innovations while making investments in AI more accessible for the average investor.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s presale success isn\u2019t surprising to those who have paid attention to investor attitudes regarding AI in the last several years, with investments increasing exponentially from $12 billion in 2015 to $119 billion in 2022.\n\nInQubeta is riding the AI wave, with total investments in the sector expected to exceed $1.5 trillion by 2030.\n\nInvestors Swapping Altcoins for InQubeta (QUBE) Tokens\n\nCardano and Solana both have the potential for substantial growth in 2023, so investors swapping them out for QUBE signifies how optimistic they are about the project\u2019s future.\n\nAI is poised to be the next major technological revolution and InQubeta\u2019s platform provides barrier-free access to investment opportunities created by the disruption it causes.\n\nStartups use InQubeta\u2019s ecosystem to raise capital by developing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are listed on the marketplace once given the operations team\u2019s seal of approval.\n\nInvestors use $QUBE tokens to purchase the NFTs of any companies they think have the potential to innovate in the AI space, becoming part-owners with them.\n\nSome of these NFTs also provide investors with additional rewards like a slice of profits or discounts on items developed.\n\n$QUBE tokens are the ecosystem\u2019s native currency, with a fixed supply of 1.5 billion tokens. Deflationary practices, like a 2% burn tax, promote long-term price growth.\n\n$QUBE holders can stake their tokens to help operate the blockchain and earn additional tokens.\n\nNo Turning Back From AI\n\nThe artificial intelligence industry has surpassed many milestones in the last decade, leading to many industries and technology experts bracing for an AI-driven future.\n\nUS President Joe Biden recently warned that AI will cause more change in the next ten years, than other technologies, like the internet, have done in the last 50 years.\n\nAI will disrupt many industries while creating countless new opportunities. Investors who pick the right startups to invest in stand to enjoy similar profits to what those who backed dotcoms like Netflix in the early 2000s earned.\n\nCardano (ADA) Investors Getting Frustrated\n\nCardano is one of the most promising projects in the cryptocurrency space, but that hasn\u2019t helped its rebound since the 2022 crash.\n\nIt\u2019s one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) main rivals and its blockchain provides faster transaction speeds and lower fees.\n\nIt\u2019s also one of the most energy-efficient altcoins, with a significantly smaller carbon footprint than older blockchains like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, whose miners use up more energy than countries like Denmark, Argentina, and the Philippines.\n\nDespite all the things the Cardano project has going for it, its prices remain seriously undervalued, leading to investors looking for more rewarding alternatives like InQubeta.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Growth Remains Slow\n\nThe Solana platform facilitates the development of decentralized applications and decentralized financial services.\n\nIt combines a proof-of-history protocol with a proof-of-stake mechanism to improve the scalability of its blockchain.\n\nLike Cardano, Solana has struggled to recover its losses caused by the 2022 crash. Its investors are getting increasingly frustrated.\n\nSummary\n\nAltcoins like Solana and Cardano continue to struggle in a bearish cryptocurrency market, while new players like InQubeta are bringing in mainstream and crypto investors thanks to its link to artificial intelligence.\n\nInQubeta has emerged as one of the top altcoins to buy in 2023 as investors have the potential to increase their holdings by up to 50x after its launch.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"
