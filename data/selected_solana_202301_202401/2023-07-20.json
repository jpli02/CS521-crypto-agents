        "title": "Solana Labs Launches Solang for Ethereum Solidity Developers - Coinfomania",
        "content": "Solana Labs, the company behind the layer-1 blockchain Solana network, announced on Wednesday the launch of Solang, a compiler allowing developers to write smart contracts on the Solana network in the Solidity programming language.\n\nSolana Labs Debuts Solang\n\nSolana\u2019s smart contracts are originally written in the Rust or C programming language. On the other hand, Ethereum smart contracts use Solidity programming language. With the introduction of Solang, developers familiar with Solidity and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can deploy decentralized applications on the energy-efficient Solana network.\n\nThe Solang compiler will support Solana SPL tokens and compatibility with Ethereum Solidity 0.8. It will also enable access to native Solana built-in functionality, smart contracts, and the ability to call other Solana smart contracts.\n\nThe Solang Solidity compiler is not the first programming language featured on the Solana mainnet. Last year, Seahorse was launched, enabling the popular Python programming language to be integrated with the Solana network.\n\nWill Solang Replace Neon EVM?\n\nOn July 17th, blockchain-focused company Neon Labs debuted the Neon EVM, an innovation that allows Ethereum developers to easily deploy their projects on the Solana blockchain. Solang doesn\u2019t replace Neon EVM, rather it \u201chelps bridge the gap between EVM developers and the Solana ecosystem.\u201d\n\nSolana\u2019s Head of Strategy, Austin Federa, buttressed this point in a tweet using a \u201cstrained analogy\u201d:\n\n\u201cNeon EVM lets you run Windows on Mac in a virtual machine, with all the Windows stuff and programs. Solang lets you run a program built for Windows on Mac.\u201d\n\nIn his analogy, Federa likened Ethereum to Windows and Solana to Mac. This goes to say that Solang and Neon EVM will both work to onboard Ethereum developers and dApps into the Solana mainnet.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s efforts to expand have rubbed off on the performance of its native cryptocurrency, SOL. A month ago, SOL traded at $16. However, the asset has rebounded, reaching a current trading price of over $26 as its ecosystem grows."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nDespite its past of unreliability, a Q2 2023 Solana Network maintained an 100% uptime in Q2 2023, according to the Solana Foundation\u2019s Network Performance Report, representing one of many enhancements made to Solana\u2019s network infrastructure and performance during the first half of the year.\n\nThe network, managed by an extensive, independent group of validators worldwide, has shown improvements across several performance metrics, including the ratio of non-voting-to-voting transactions, block production time, and transactions per second.\n\nDan Albert, executive director of the Solana Foundation, suggests that Solana\u2019s performance is only part of the story, according to the press release. The network\u2019s underlying decentralization is also a key point of focus:\n\n\u201cThe first half of 2023 presented a number of challenges for the network but the network performed very well and more advancements in the ecosystem are on the way that will further distinguish Solana as the leading decentralized smart contract blockchain.\u201d\n\nSolana measures its network\u2019s decentralization and vitality with four metrics: block-producing validators, RPC nodes, the Nakamoto Coefficient and active open-source developers on the network. The Foundation\u2019s report reveals positive figures for all these metrics.\n\nOn the innovation front, state compression has debuted on Solana. This technique, which allows data to be stored directly on-chain, has drastically cut costs. For instance, minting 100 million NFTs on Solana now costs a mere 50 SOL.\n\nAfter an outage on February 25, Solana made significant strides to improve its network software upgrade process, incorporating additional external developers and auditors into the release process, as well as enhanced server restart processes. Because of this, the network achieved full uptime since the intervention and seamlessly transitioned network version 1.14 to the mainnet.\n\nNext on the list is adding Solana Improvement Documents-33, Timely Vote Credits, to the network in Q3, which is \u201cintended to reduce block finalization times and disincentivize intentionally delayed voting,\u201d according to the report."

        "title": "Ethereum rivals are 'dead on arrival,' says Cumberland's Van Bourg - Blockworks",
        "content": "Despite the crypto market\u2019s turn toward a cautiously positive sentiment, things aren\u2019t looking good for Ethereum\u2019s competitors, according to Jonah Van Bourg.\n\nOn the 1000X podcast (Spotify/Apple), Cumberland\u2019s global head of trading says user counts and wallet addresses have plateaued on alternative layer-1 blockchains.\n\n\u201cYour Solanas, NEARs and Polkadots \u2014 and all these other coins \u2014 these ecosystems are dead on arrival at this point.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are flourishing, Van Bourg says. According to Blockworks Research, the TVL, or total value locked \u2014 a measure of the monetary value that resides in a blockchain\u2019s ecosystem \u2014 is comparatively low on competing chains.\n\nThe current total value locked in Solana stands at approximately $320 million, a little more than one percent of Ethereum\u2019s TVL, which is currently around $26 billion.\n\nEthereum-based layer-2 chains Arbitrum and Optimism are trending positively and already overshadow Solana\u2019s TVL with values of approximately $2 billion and $900 million, respectively.\n\nChart by Blockworks Research analyst Spencer Hughes\n\n\u201cSo is the multichain thesis still alive for the next cycle?\u201d Van Bourg asks. \u201cI vote no. I think it\u2019s time to write it off.\u201d\n\nThe greed factor\n\nAvi Feldman, GoldenTree\u2019s head of digital asset trading, is quick to disagree.\n\n\u201cGreed is too large to write it off,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get projects that are willing to build on things like Solana and Avalanche and NEAR and all of these other protocols because if they\u2019re a competent, good team, they can win that space.\u201d\n\nIncentive programs will draw value to competing protocols, Felman argues, \u201cwhen the bull market comes back.\u201d\n\nBut incentive programs have been the \u201conly draw\u201d for the competing chains, Van Bourg retorts. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t last forever.\u201d\n\nFelman expects competing chains to experience a \u201crenaissance\u201d due to their novelty and the \u201cgreed factor,\u201d arguing that by onboarding people with incentives, they may potentially reach \u201cescape velocity\u201d to become \u201creal projects.\u201d\n\nReferring to a previous interview with Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz (Spotify/Apple), Van Bourg says the next bull cycle will be the \u201cshow me\u201d stage of crypto, whereby projects need to prove their worth at a practical level.\n\n\u201cWhat computational ability is possible on Solana that isn\u2019t possible on Arbitrum or Optimism at this point?\u201d he asks.\n\nFelman says it\u2019s not so much about the tech itself, but instead a matter of \u201cuse-case fit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe constraint is not always the tech. The constraint is figuring out what to do with the tech,\u201d he says.\n\nVan Bourg agrees, but suggests that the argument only further proves his point. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t about the tech, what\u2019s the advantage of one shiny alt-L1 versus another versus ETH?\u201d Ethereum, he says, \u201cgives you everything you need right now for today\u2019s limited slate of use-cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf ETH was bowling over because of too many people trying to use it or too much throughput,\u201d Van Bourg says, \u201cthen you have an alt-L1 thesis right there.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Cross-chain web3 startup Cosmic Wire raises $30M - Refresh Miami",
        "content": "By Riley Kaminer\n\nFor a while, it seemed like picking a blockchain network was like supporting a baseball team. You probably forgot how you ended up being their fan, but you are in too deep to change your allegiance.\n\nBut that might be changing now, thanks to Miami startup Cosmic Wire. As the crypto winter begins to thaw, the startup is working to develop cross-chain web3 solutions.\n\nThis week, Cosmic Wire announced that they have raised a $30 million seed round from lead investors Solana Foundation and Polygon. The startup is developing a series of blockchain infrastructure products. According to Coindesk, this includes solutions for analytics, digital identity management, smart contract development tools, and chain-agnostic marketplaces.\n\nWhy does the cross-chain nature of Cosmic Wire matter? Because this approach facilitates data transfer interoperability across different blockchains. And Cosmic Wire hopes to do so without compromising privacy. Much to the contrary, the company reports that they hope to provide users with sovereign control over their data and online interactions.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited for Cosmic Wire\u2019s Web3 infrastructure to be built on the Solana network,\u201d commented Johnny Lee, general manager of Games, Entertainment, and Media at the Solana Foundation, the non-profit promoting the adoption of the Solana ecosystem.\n\n\u201cTheir metaverse SDK solutions significantly reduce development times of high-fidelity, 3D, browser-based metaverse experiences with e-commerce of both physical web3 digital products, content CDNs, payment solutions and avatar UGC all integrated,\u201d Lee continued. \u201cSolana Foundation has always supported tools and infrastructure builders, and we are excited for Cosmic Wire to deliver new metaverse experiences on the Solana network that have never been possible before.\u201d\n\nNext up for Cosmic Wire is joining Google Cloud\u2019s web3 startup program. Among many benefits of the program are up to $200,000 in Google Cloud credits and priority review for the Polygon Ventures Ecosystem Fund and dedicated investment dollars totaling up to $3 million.\n\nCosmic Wire founder and CEO Jerad Finck has the diverse kind of background you would only find in the Web3 space. After a stint on the tech team of Nokia during the dotcom boom, Finck launched a mental wellness center serving low-income patients. He then launched a music publishing and catalog representation company and worked as a musician and producer himself \u2013 working for clients including Sony, Universal, and Warner Bros. Finck started working on Cosmic Wire in June 2021.\n\n\u201cWe are so grateful for the overwhelming support from our investors and partners,\u201d said Finck. \u201cThanks to the massive success of the seed round, we\u2019re now empowering creators, businesses, and entire industry sectors connecting people globally, and transforming the very way we communicate and transact.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cCosmic Wire is blazing the path forward driving Web3 in exciting new ways resulting in exponential increases of efficiencies and monetization of systems at scale. We have all seen what Web3 isn\u2019t, now we will show you what it is.\u201d\n\nPhoto at top of post shows Jerad Finck, founder and CEO of Cosmic Wire, and Johnny Lee, general manager of Games, Entertainment, and Media at Solana Foundation.\n\nREAD MORE IN REFRESH MIAMI:"
