        "title": "Just One Game on Solana Is Doing More Daily Transactions Than All of Polygon - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSAGE Labs, the browser-based sci-fi game experience on Solana from the Star Atlas team, saw over 2.29 million transactions on Sunday\u2014surpassing the total for the entire Polygon network by about 256,000 transactions.\n\nAccording to data from analytics platform Flipside Crypto, Star Atlas\u2019 SAGE Labs experience has seen over 16 million total transactions since it launched last month. The browser game is a fully on-chain experience, with nearly every interaction requiring the user to sign with their wallet on the Solana blockchain, triggering a small gas fee to verify each transaction.\n\nSAGE Labs is a 2D space management simulation experience that\u2019s heavy on menus, simulated resource management tasks, and data\u2014as opposed to being a 3D immersive gaming experience like the core Star Atlas MMORPG in development.\n\nSAGE Labs has liftoff! Updated stats below. \ud83d\udc47 \ud83d\udd39 16,000,000+ Solana transactions\n\n\ud83d\udd39 15% of daily @solana transactions \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\ud83d\udd39 2,000,000+ DAILY transactions\n\n\ud83d\udd39 8,577 profiles created\n\n\ud83d\udd39 37,640 fleets created \u27a1\ufe0f Join the journey now: https://t.co/o8W50NyxsP \u2014 Star Atlas (@staratlas) October 9, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, SAGE Labs recorded 2,293,210 transactions, per Flipside. By comparison, the entire Polygon network saw 2,037,330 transactions, according to data from blockchain explorer Polygonscan. Polygon is an Ethereum scaling network.\n\nUltimately, SAGE Labs transactions alone made up about 15% of all activity on the Solana network on October 8. But while SAGE Labs\u2019 transaction tally may indicate a sizable player pool, digging into the data suggests otherwise.\n\nSAGE Labs saw 1,442 active players on Sunday, each making roughly 1,590 transactions apiece. That\u2019s a staggeringly high number of transactions for one player\u2014but it\u2019s because of how the game was designed.\n\nThe spike in SAGE Labs activity has generated some social media attention, with Twitter users debating how exactly a single game is dwarfing an entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, how many of these transactions might be from bots or automated accounts. Star Atlas developer ATMTA did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment regarding whether it is able to determine if any, or how many, of SAGE\u2019s users might be bots or otherwise automating the experience.\n\nA Star Atlas representative previously told Decrypt via email that SAGE Labs is \u201cunlike any other \u2018Web3\u2019 game out there\u201d because \u201cabsolutely everything is done on-chain.\u201d When more (or all) game elements require a player to sign a transaction with their wallet, it can add up\u2014even with a relatively small player base.\n\nA game like SAGE Labs is different from other games that deploy NFTs because many blockchain games offer an optional crypto experience\u2014meaning that players aren\u2019t forced to connect a wallet or spend crypto to play.\n\nBut SAGE Labs requires a Solana-compatible wallet to play, as well as some SOL or Star Atlas\u2019 ATLAS tokens in said wallet in order to create a character and progress through the experience.\n\nStar Atlas CEO Michael Wagner previously told Decrypt that developers can use SAGE Labs to build their own UI or modify the game\u2019s mechanics to create their own experience.\n\nWhile SAGE Labs is seeing substantial traffic, Star Atlas has faced economic challenges this year. Back in July, it laid off 73% of its staff. At the time, Wagner told Decrypt that the layoffs were needed to adapt to the market conditions and to reduce overhead to \u201caccommodate a long runway\u201d for Star Atlas\u2019 continued development."
