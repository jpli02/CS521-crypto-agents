        "title": "Wolfe Research: Bitcoin could stay rangebound, Solana poised for breakout - CNBC",
        "content": "Bitcoin investors have high hopes for 2024 given the cryptocurrency's almost too-good-to-be-true setup , but they may have to wait a few weeks more for its next big ascent, according to Wolfe Research. On Wednesday, bitcoin finished the month of January right where it started, just above the flat line at the $42,000 level, despite the long-awaited launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. That's largely due to an extended sell-the-news phenomenon that pushed bitcoin below $39,000 at one point. The price has recovered but has yet to reclaim its post-ETF approval highs. BTC.CM= 1M mountain Bitcoin ended the month of January flat and is poised for more weakness, says Wolfe Research. \"Although it's rallied back about 15% off that Jan. 23 low, we see continued consolidation in the low $40,000 range over the next few weeks,\" Wolfe's chart analyst Rob Ginsberg said in a note Wednesday. \"A breakout does not look likely in the near term. \u2026 Bitcoin's longer-term overbought condition has still yet to really come in. This leads us to believe we see further declines over the next month or two before its next run.\" Meanwhile, Solana and other altcoins may be poised for breakouts. \"With a bull flag now forming \u2026 and [the moving average convergence/divergence] turning back positive, we feel a breakout through $100 to new highs is near,\" Ginsberg said of Solana. \"Several of the altcoins we look at are setting up similarly. If this risk on attitude to start the year is to continue, crypto \u2014 and particularly altcoins \u2014 stand to reap those benefits.\" Solana rallied more than 550% between September and January before pulling back in recent weeks. SOL.CM= YTD mountain Solana pulled back in January after being the top crypto performer in 2023. \"We're used to seeing bitcoin outperform other assets, so this is quite telling,\" Ginsberg said. \"Solana and other altcoins have come on strong in recent months and [will] likely continue that outperformance near term.\" Altcoins have been more in focus since about the time the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission greenlit trading of spot bitcoin ETFs. The day before the approval, on Jan. 9, bitcoin dominance , which shows how bitcoin is performing relative to other crypto assets, dropped sharply. With investors looking forward to a bull run in bitcoin, they're expecting more trading action in smaller and cheaper altcoins, which benefit from rises in the bitcoin price and can give investors faster and bigger returns. Ginsberg said the tokens tied to Cardano and Avalanche are also set to rise in the near term, and Chainlink could be poised for a breakout. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "title": "Pro-Ethereum Crowd Slams Solana-based Jupiter Airdrop as 'Absolute Trash' - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum enthusiasts and Solana devotees have been trading insults over one of the key mechanisms used in the airdrop for Solana-based decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter.\n\nJupiter\u2019s LFG Launchpad is a portal where traders can claim their airdrop distribution and use services to facilitate the trading of newly issued tokens. In the instance of the JUP airdrop, Jupiter traders can claim their airdrop allocation of JUP in addition to acquiring more tokens at launch by presetting limit orders or dollar cost-averaging functions.\n\nWhen traders acquire more tokens through Jupiter\u2019s LFG Launchpad, they are engaging with a single-sided liquidity pool that initially only had JUP. When the airdrop went live, traders were able to withdraw JUP from the pool and deposit USDC.\n\nRead More: Jupiter Traders Claim Whopping 545 Million JUP Tokens in First 8 Hours of Airdrop\n\nOf JUP\u2019s 10 billion total token supply, the Jupiter team allocated 250 million JUP for the single-sided liquidity launch pool and 100 million JUP for the launchpad fees, according to a forum post written by Meow two days ago that detailed JUP\u2019s token genesis event.\n\nThis means traders, who purchase tokens through Jupiter\u2019s launchpad infrastructure, are acquiring JUP directly from the 250 million pot that the Jupiter team earmarked for the liquidity pool on its airdrop launch page. On Thursday, Meow said on X that Jupiter\u2019s core members will in a week take the USDC and JUP inside the liquidity pool and place the funds into the team treasury.\n\nMoreover, 75% of the 100 million JUP allocated as LFG launchpad fees is dedicated to the coming JUP DAO and the remaining 25% is for the Jupiter core team.\n\nWhile people from the Solana ecosystem have praised Jupiter and its founder Meow for how Jupiter\u2019s core members designed and conducted its airdrop, members of the Solana-rival pro-Ethereum camp had harsh words for the decentralized exchange aggregator.\n\nEthereum Crowd\u2019s Takeaway\n\nCritics cite Jupiter and its founder Meow on two elements of Jupiter\u2019s airdrop infrastructure: the team having 250 million JUP tokens to sell and the Jupiter ecosystem keeping 100 million JUP tokens fee for launching on their own launchpad.\n\nEthereum enthusiasts have raised concerns about the Jupiter team selling tokens to the public through the token launch pool, immediately following its airdrop going live. A strategic advisor for liquid staking provider Lido and Ethereum research firm Flashbots, who goes by \u201cHasu,\u201d said on X that Jupiter selling the 250 million JUP tokens for stablecoin USDC is a \u201cTruly remarkable grift\u201d and \u201cOne for the textbooks.\u201d\n\nIn reference to the launchpad fee of 100 million JUP tokens that will end up in the pockets of the JUP DAO and the core team, Paul Dylan-Ennis, a lecturer in the College of Business, University College Dublin who writes about Ethereum culture, said on X, \u201cThis is Solana\u2019s ICO era of absolute trash.\u201d\n\nSolana Crowd\u2019s Pushback\n\nThose defending Jupiter argue that the information about the 250 million JUP tokens for the launchpad liquidity pool and the 100 million JUP tokens for the launchpad fee has been publicly accessible for months.\n\nMike Dudas, general partner at 6th Man Ventures, expressed sarcastic outrage about Jupiter\u2019s transparency. \u201cI, for one, am extremely outraged that @weremeow and @JupiterExchange launched their token in the exact manner they said they would after sharing the methodology in excruciating detail across numerous communication methods for multiple months,\u201d he shared on X.\n\nRead More: Jupiter\u2019s Airdropped Token JUP Debuts at a $878 Million Market Cap\n\nSolana enthusiasts also took the opportunity to use ad hominems to call out Ethereum loyalists. One X user in a tweet about Jupiter\u2019s controversy said, \u201c0xdumbass.eths are crying \u2013 thats just what they do \u2014 ignore them.\u201d Another said, \u201cETH Maxis can cry all they want and make unfounded statements\u2026 having haters comes with the territory.\u201d\n\nMeow defended Jupiter\u2019s decision to allocate 250 million JUP tokens inside the launchpad liquidity pool. \u201cBy doing it this way, airdrop recipients get a massive pool to constantly sell into, while prospective buyers have assurance that there is a big pool to absorb big selling pressure from airdrops that will cause them immediate massive rekt,\u201d wrote Meow on X.\n\nRivalry Going Back Years\n\nThe back-and-forth between supporters of Solana and Ethereum is the latest development in the rivalry between the two blockchain networks. For years, people have referred to Solana as the \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d but Ethereum has been the incumbent leader for blockchain networks with smart contract functionality. While Solana has historically trailed Ethereum \u2014 falling further behind during the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX \u2014 in the past few months, Solana has made a comeback. It\u2019s been successfully challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance in terms of several metrics such as a thriving memecoin ecosystem and trading volume on decentralized exchanges."

        "title": "5 Solana Airdrops You Should Be Hunting - Bankless",
        "content": "JUPuary has officially concluded, and we\u2019re declaring it a success. A total of 1B JUP was airdropped to nearly one million individual addresses, and top recipients are eligible to claim $70k in free money!\n\nWhile Jupiter\u2019s November 2nd snapshot date excluded many new entrants to the Solana ecosystem from claiming JUP, they did not find themselves without rewards during JUPuary. Every wallet that interacted with Jupiter in the six months leading up to January 19 was eligible to claim $60 in WEN, a test token for Jupiter\u2019s launch pad, last week!\n\nJupiter\u2019s two high-value claim opportunities have built off the airdrop momentum that gripped Solana last year and further bolstered the value proposition behind hunting Solana airdrops, renewing the incentives motivating airdrop hunters to search out the chain\u2019s next big airdrop.\n\nThankfully, the Solana ecosystem is uniquely positioned with a wealth of tokenless protocols to offer early users a bounty of quality airdrop opportunities! Today, we\u2019re walking you through five of our favorite Solana hunts that you can start today to position yourself for a future airdrop \ud83d\udc47\n\n\u26aa marginfi\n\nWebsite | Twitter\n\nSector: Lending, Liquid Staking\n\nAbout:\n\nIntentionally branded in all lowercase, marginfi aims to become a suite of smart contracts that create a DeFi prime brokerage, facilitating peer-to-peer lending and portfolio management across blockchains. Users can access marginfi via desktop browser or install it as a PWA on mobile devices!\n\nThe platform\u2019s initial (and most popular) product, mrgnlend, is an overcollateralized money market protocol that allows anyone to lend or borrow assets on Solana. In September, marginfi extended its product line with the introduction of LST, a SOL liquid staking token with 0% commission offering depositors yields from network rewards and MEV extraction, and the Protocol will soon offer its own LST-collateralized stablecoin, YBX.\n\nWhy we\u2019re watching:\n\nmarginfi has an ongoing points program, rewarding early users for lending, borrowing, and referring others to the platform! Protocols often implement a points system as a precursor to an airdrop to help identify accounts contributing towards their success.\n\nMaximize your eligibility by:\n\n\ud83d\udfe3 Phantom\n\nWebsite | Twitter\n\nSector: Wallet\n\nAbout:\n\nWhile the Phantom wallet has long been a cornerstone of the Solana ecosystem, it also can be used to manage crypto assets and access dApps on Polygon and Ethereum! The wallet is available as a browser extension or can be downloaded as an app from the iOS and Android stores.\n\nPhantom provides functionality for in-wallet buys, allowing users to purchase popular crypto assets on supported chains from a variety of payment partners, including Coinbase, Robinhood, and Moonpay. Users can spin up multiple Phantom sub-accounts to segregate transaction activity, with a unique Ethereum and Solana address pair created for each account.\n\nWhy we\u2019re watching:\n\nWhile there is no strong precedent for wallets to airdrop tokens, and Phantom has provided no indication that they do so, using Phantom as your wallet solution on Solana is an easy way to simplify your experience with the chain while maximizing your potential to receive an airdrop!\n\nMaximize your eligibility by:\n\nDownloading the Phantom wallet\n\nFunding your Phantom wallet with SOL\n\nSwapping assets in Phantom\n\n\ud83d\udfe4 Drift\n\nWebsite | Twitter\n\nSector: Exchange\n\nAbout:\n\nDrift is an exchange on Solana with a built-in money market! Users first deposit funds to their Drift account and then unlock access to the Protocol's perpetual swap (with up to 10x leverage), variable rate money market, insurance staking fund, LP strategy, and spot token swap products.\n\nThe combination of Drift's native cross-margin capabilities and its money market provides numerous benefits for users. All collateral deposited to Drift natively earns yield, and any deposited asset can be borrowed against or used to fund trades, although longer tail assets have lower initial asset weightings that cap leverage to prevent unprofitable liquidations.\n\nWhy we\u2019re watching:\n\nDrift has an active points program that rewards users for making trades on the platform! Protocols often implement a points system as a precursor to an airdrop to help identify accounts contributing towards their success.\n\nMaximize your eligibility by:\n\n\u26ab Tensor\n\nWebsite | Twitter\n\nSector: Exchange\n\nAbout:\n\nTensor is an NFT marketplace on Solana with support for Solana inscriptions. The marketplace is focused on NFT traders, like Blur, but the team is moving to increase the appeal of their platform for retail traders as well.\n\nPrice locks from Tensor are a novel primitive that empowers NFT traders to lock in a buy or sell price for seven days. Users who fund locks earn extremely high yields from the premiums paid on every trade but will accrue losses when a lock is purchased and expires in the money.\n\nWhen a long lock expires in the money, the lock's funder will receive an amount of SOL equal to the price they sold the lock plus the initial fee paid by the purchaser, instead of their original NFT they provided as collateral. When a short lock expires in the money, the lock's funder will receive an NFT from the collection they sold the lock on plus the initial fee paid by the purchaser, instead of the SOL they provided as collateral. Funders of locks that are not exercised receive their initial collateral back plus the fee paid.\n\nTensorians are a collection of 10k NFTs that play a core role in the Tensor ecosystem, offering a 1.5x boost in their points program and a passive 20% point yield!\n\nWhy we\u2019re watching:\n\nTensor has an active points program! Crypto projects use points programs to identify early users, often with the intention of rewarding those contributing to the success of the protocol with tokens, making it highly likely that Tensor will pursue an airdrop! Currently, Tensor's points program is rewarding users for funding locks.\n\nMaximize your eligibility by:\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 Jupiter\n\nWebsite | Twitter\n\nSector: Exchange\n\nAbout:\n\nJupiter's primary product is its decentralized exchange aggregator on Solana that offers both spot and perpetual swap products! While Jupiter hosts its own front-end, their aggregator widget is used by many protocols, like marginfi, to facilitate in-app swaps.\n\nJupiter's frontend provides functionality for complex limit and DCA orders, and degens can satisfy their desire to trade with Jupiter's perps, which offer up to 100x leverage on BTC, ETH, and SOL. Jupiter has also developed a token launchpad solution for newly created tokens to distribute their airdrops.\n\nWhy we\u2019re (still) watching:\n\nWhile the snapshot for the first Jupiter airdrop has already closed, the Project is allocating 40% of its token supply to the community over four separate airdrop rounds. Only a quarter of these tokens have been distributed, and you still have three chances to qualify for JUP drops!\n\nMaximize your eligibility by:"
