        "content": "Just north of the US-101 freeway in Hollywood, Grubb Properties continues to add to its portfolio of new multifamily residential developments in the City of Los Angeles.\n\nThe Link Apartments Solana, announced late last year, would rise from a vacant corner lot at 1353 N. Western Avenue that last sold in mid-2020 for $3.5 million. Plans now under review by Department of Building and Safety would permit the construction of a new seven-story building featuring 70 apartments above 2,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space.\n\nUrban Architecture Lab is designing the Solana project, which is depicted in renderings as a contemporary podium-type building consisting of wood-frame construction above a concrete base. Planned amenities include a podium-level pool deck, a rooftop amenity space, and a fitness center.\n\nThe project is one of five new developments that North Carolina-based Grubb Properties announced last year as part of its entrance into the L.A. market, following projects which have already been announced for the Koreatown, Hollywood, and North Hollywood communities. Per a news release, all five projects are being funded using Opportunity Zone funds, and are being developed in partnership with Blackridge Ventures and Allied Urban.\n\nThe Solana site sits just south of the busy intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Western Avenue, following other new multifamily residential projects now in planning or construction. Holland Partner Group is currently building a 185-unit complex one block to the west, while a 735-unit mixed-use project moves through the approval process at 5420 Sunset Boulevard.\n\nFollow us on social media:\n\nTwitter / Facebook / LinkedIn"

        "content": "Blockchain infrastructure company Chorus One has released a white paper and an open-source prototype that can enable validators to capture maximum extractable value (MEV) on the Solana network.\n\nAlthough characteristics of Chorus One\u2019s prototype are similar to Ethereum\u2019s Flashbots\u2019 block-building marketplace, because of the technical differences between the two blockchains, the Solana solution does not require a public mempool, as it does not follow the marketplace model.\n\nOn Ethereum, MEV is the additional revenue made by rearranging the order of transactions in a block. Validators aggregate transactions into blocks and are looking at ways to build a block that is more profitable for them.\n\nBy contrast, on Solana, a block processor is known ahead of time, and nodes will deliver transactions to a sole validator who will be responsible for proposing a block in a slot \u2014 this also contributes to the faster block processing times on the network when compared to Ethereum.\n\nAs transactions go straight to a block and users don\u2019t have a buffer period to reorder transactions, the marketplace model to capture MEV, which works on Ethereum, would have significant downsides if replicated on Solana.\n\nThe proposed solution by Chorus One, dubbed \u201cthe decentralized extraction by validators,\u201d will introduce a modified Solana client that will handle MEV opportunities in the banking stage of the validator, Thalita Franklin, a research analyst at Chorus One, told Blockworks.\n\nIn this solution, validators will check after every batch of user transactions to see if it could have created an MEV and add transactions if it notices that there is an opportunity. This modification of the transaction process will not introduce new network requirements or protocol changes.\n\n\u201cBecause the solana-MEV client does not introduce any new central coordination point, it enables a diverse set of validators to flourish without creating new censorship risks,\u201d the company said in its white paper.\n\nAdding that, \u201cUnlike the block building marketplace, the Solana MEV client would bring more transparency and democracy around MEV to Solana, without degrading performance, or thwarting Solana\u2019s main networking innovations.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that the Solana MEV prototype will be wholly open sourced \u2014 available under a free software license \u2014 and is not meant to be a competitor to other MEV solutions on the network.\n\n\u201cChorus One is not doing this commercially and we\u2019re not releasing a full-fledged product,\u201d Hari Iyer, marketing manager at Chorus One, told Blockworks. \u201cWe [have been] working on this for the last few months and now are releasing a prototype so that the community can test it out.\u201d\n\nIyer notes that through this open-source solution, the Solana community can eventually evolve this white paper into \u201csomething more,\u201d and that Chorus One itself is not looking to maintain the prototype in the future.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Can Solana Reach $100 Again? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Solana claims to be the fastest crypto on the market, but is it too good to be true? Find out if Solana is worth your investment today.\n\nSolana (SOL 0.01%) is one of the fastest cryptocurrencies on the market. It's also one of the most volatile names in crypto at the moment. Solana's price soared to $260 per token in November 2021 before falling as far at $8.14 in the aftermath of the FTX meltdown.\n\nToken prices are going up again, just above $23 per token on the evening of Monday, Feb. 6. Will this elusive cryptocurrency make it back to $100 any time soon?\n\nSolana's blazing speed\n\nSolana's greatest strength is its blazing transaction speed. Designed by a team of former mobile network engineers, the blockchain network is optimized for massive scalability and ultra-efficient use of resources. So Solana runs on a custom proof of stake network with a unique secondary system called proof of history.\n\nTogether, these blockchain tools routinely validate roughly 5,000 transactions per second (TPS), and that capacity should rise to 700,000 over the next few years. Solana processes a new block of data every 400 milliseconds, or more than twice per second.\n\nBy contrast, Bitcoin (BTC 1.66%) can only handle 7 transactions per second and it can take up to an hour before a new data block is finalized in this system.\n\nSo Solana looks like a perfect fit for blockchain-based applications where quick transactions are a must. Originally created with decentralized finance (DeFi) apps in mind, Solana's system of instant transactions and advanced smart contracts could also be perfect for real-time games or metaverse exploration.\n\nThis sounds like a slam-dunk winner, right? App developers must be trampling one another in a rush to sign up for Solana-based projects in the realms of DeFi and blockchain games. Then, the token price should increase dramatically since more real-world usage drives higher demand and rising prices. Off to the moon we go, and $100 per token should only be an early milepost along the way.\n\nRight?\n\nPotential security issues and technical errors\n\nWell, not so fast.\n\nSolana has its flaws, too. The extreme focus on speed and efficiency may make this blockchain network more vulnerable to security issues and technical errors than the slower and steadier Ethereum (ETH 0.67%) or Bitcoin systems. In fact, Solana has suffered several lengthy outages over the last year. Ethereum hasn't seen an outage since November 2020. Bitcoin has reported 100% uptime since 2013. Solana has been flaky, frankly speaking.\n\nThe hyper-speed transactions come with other costs, too. New developers may find it difficult to work with Solana's complex consensus mechanism. This crypto network is also much newer than arch-rival Ethereum, giving the older network a first-mover advantage that won't be easy to erase.\n\nAnd then there was the FTX scandal. The bankrupt crypto-trading exchange was one the largest holders of Solana tokens, which is why Solana's price collapsed as the FTX crisis played out. Now, the lightning-fast smart contracts platform must overcome the stigma of playing a part in that disaster.\n\nOwning Solana: risk vs. reward\n\nSolana's developer community is running miles behind market leader Ethereum while facing the headwinds of FTX connections and too-common system outages.\n\nI'm not saying Solana is doomed, but it could certainly take a while to climb past the $100 mark again. This project needs to stabilize its fast but unstable network and follow up with genius-level marketing moves. Solana has to overcome a crisis of confidence, among app developers and also the general public.\n\nTime heals all wounds, of course, but simply waiting until the scars of this downturn have healed probably won't be good enough. While Solana licks its wounds, rival cryptocurrencies will move forward with their own marketing and system upgrade plans. In this case, time isn't Solana's friend. The longer it takes to overcome these challenges, the more project leaders will opt for Ethereum and other smart contract platforms instead.\n\nSo Solana needs to step up quickly, and that's a tall order. Never say die; the future is incredibly hard to predict in the fast-moving cryptocurrency market, but I don't recommend planning your financial future around $100 Solana tokens. That milestone looks distant today, and Solana might never get there at all. Keep your Solana investments on the smaller side, because the risks appear to outweigh the upside nowadays."

        "content": "After an explosive 2021, during which Solana skyrocketed to its all-time high of nearly $260 on the heels of +1,120% yearly gains, Solana saw a -94% drop in its value in 2022. Ironically, last year\u2019s price drop could be a strong argument for Solana being a good investment, as it is far from being overbought. While the price underwent a massive correction, the underlying tech and ecosystem remained virtually unchanged.\n\nAfter a painful year for Solana investors, this year, the cryptocurrency has been off to a great start, gaining over +137% since the start of the year. In terms of relative profit margins, this puts Solana way ahead of some of the most prominent crypto staples in the same period, including Bitcoin (+39% YTD), Ethereum (+37% YTD), and BNB (+34% YTD)\n\nIn this article, we are going to examine the main reasons why Solana could be a good investment in 2023. In addition, we\u2019ll take into consideration its main drawbacks as well. Finally, we\u2019ll also examine the current state of technical indicators to gauge where the price of Solana could be heading in the coming months.\n\nHere\u2019s why Solana is considered a good investment\n\nAfter a stellar 2020 and 2021, which saw Solana emerge as a top crypto asset by market capitalization, last year brought significant disappointment to Solana investors. To make matters worse, the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange in November, which was a massive investor in Solana, saw the price of the SOL token plummet to the $10 level.\n\nWhile the aftermath of the FTX collapse is still reverberating throughout the crypto industry, most investors have come to the realization that Solana is here to stay, even without one of its biggest financial backers. In addition, there are other key reasons why Solana is a good investment as of early 2023, including:\n\nThe number of transactions keeps growing\n\nThe number of daily active DeFi users is on the rise\n\nSolana is the second most popular network for NFTs\n\nSOL is far removed from its all-time high\n\nInvest in Solana\n\nIn the following sections, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why Solana is a good investment in more detail. We\u2019ll also present a case against Solana so that you can get familiar with some of its drawbacks.\n\nThe number of transactions on Solana is growing\n\nOne of the most important metrics for gauging the health of any blockchain ecosystem is the number of active users as tech in and of itself is useless if there is no one to use it. In this regard, Solana is showing quite impressive stats.\n\nPast 90 days of Solana transactions. Image source: Dune Analytics (@kroeger0x)\n\nThe number of non-vote Solana transactions (Txs) took a hit in November after the collapse of FTX made many investors nervous about the future of Solana. However, the number of daily transactions bounced back in a big way in the coming months, growing from a low of 22.6 million in early December to 46.7 million in early January. The number of transactions has since stabilized in the sub-40 million region.\n\nThe number of daily active DeFi users is on the rise\n\nAnother encouraging metric \u2013 which coincidentally goes hand in hand with the growing number of transactions outlined in the above section \u2013 is the increase in the number of users that use decentralized applications (dApps) deployed on Solana.\n\nNumber of DeFi users on Solana in the past month. Image source: Dune Analytics (@sealaunch)\n\nWhereas the number of users in the second half of December never surpassed 20,000 daily active users, that number rose beyond 50,000 in early January and stabilized in the sub-40,000 region. The main driver was an increase in the activity on the Raydium (RAY) protocol, which is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) and liquidity provider built on the Solana blockchain for the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\nWhile the growth in Solana\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) area is certainly encouraging, it is worth noting that not every DeFi metric can be considered positive (more on that in a section below).\n\nSolana is the second most popular NFT network\n\nSolana is one of the best-performing blockchains in the industry in terms of transaction speed with a 5-second finality. In addition, Solana is one of the cheapest blockchains for crypto transfers, with an average transaction fee of less than $0.001.\n\nEthereum and Solana are by far the most used networks for NFT use cases. Image source: CryptoSlam\n\nThe low cost and high transaction speed have played a pivotal role in elevating Solana among the favorites for non-fungible token (NFT) collectors and traders. According to CryptoSlam data, about $141 million worth of NFTs were transacted in the past 30 days. Both the amount of total sales and the number of buyers have increased by around 30% in the time period.\n\nIt is worth noting that while the increase in NFT sales in the past month is a net positive for the Solana ecosystem, the total trading volume of NFTs is currently over 90% removed from its peak, and there is little indication that would suggest that the trend could reverse anytime soon. Most likely, we\u2019ll never again see multi-million valuations some NFTs reached during the NFT craze of 2021 and early 2022.\n\nSOL is trading far removed from its ATH\n\nIn the opening paragraphs we\u2019ve mentioned how Solana is currently trading over 90% lower than its ATH. While this could be perceived as a bearish signal by some, we think that such a swift and massive decrease in price can actually create a good buying opportunity.\n\nAs of this writing, Solana commands a market cap of roughly $8.5 billion, whereas it had a market cap of over $78 billion in 2021. This creates a lot of room for growth and suggests that Solana is currently undervalued.\n\nObviously, the reality is not as simple as there is no guarantee that Solana will eventually reach its previous peak valuation.\n\nWhat are the cons of Solana as an investment?\n\nWith several bullish factors outlined in the sections above, let\u2019s turn our focus to Solana\u2019s cons as an investment. In our opinion, the main drawbacks for Solana are:\n\nA strong connection to FTX\n\nA drastic decrease in TVL\n\nHigh centralization and frequent power outages\n\nLet\u2019s examine each of these factors in more detail.\n\nA strong connection to FTX\n\nIt is no secret that Solana has had a strong link with the now-defunct FTX cryptocurrency exchange. The exchange\u2019s investment arm Alameda Research was one of the investors in Solana\u2019s ICO and held billion of dollars of locked and unlocked SOL tokens.\n\nIn addition, FTX\u2019s former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was a huge supporter of Solana and has on numerous occasions highlighted it as the leading layer 1 alternative to Ethereum.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Solana will fare going forward without the support of one of the leading crypto exchanges. Also, the selling of FTX and Alameda\u2019s SOL tokens during the bankruptcy process could put downside pressure on the price, and it is currently impossible to predict how the market will react.\n\nA drastic decrease in TVL\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed the growing number of daily active DeFi users in the section above. However, that was just one side of the coin when it comes to DeFi activity on Solana. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana dropped from over $10 billion in late 2021 to \u201cjust\u201d $260 million in February 2023.\n\nSolana\u2019s TVL shrunk from $10 billion to $260 million in the span of 14 months. Image source: DeFi Llama\n\nOne concerning factor is that the massive drop in TVL is not exclusively a product of the falling price of SOL, as the absolute number of locked SOL also took a dive, from 68.2 million to 11.5 million.\n\nIf the trend continues, Solana could drop further down the ranks of most active DeFi chains. Currently, it occupies the 12th spot on the list, sandwiched between DeFiChain at the 11th spot (with a TVL of $304M) and Osmosis at the 13th (with a TVL of $206M).\n\nSimilar to when it comes to NFTs, Ethereum is by far the leading blockchain in DeFi, controlling a TVL of $29.1 billion. For context, the second-placed TRON has a TVL of $5.1 billion.\n\nA high degree of centralization and frequent power outages\n\nOne of the main disadvantages Solana detractors usually point to is the network\u2019s high degree of centralization. While this allows Solana to facilitate high-speed and low-cost transactions, it comes at the cost of reliability.\n\nFor reference, Ethereum has over 12,800 full node validators. In short, each node can verify a transaction's authenticity against the other. The network\u2019s security is a product of the number of nodes and their reliability. Solana has \u201conly\u201d 2,340 validators on the mainnet. There are even more extreme cases, as with BNB Smart Chain, for instance, which relies on just 21 validators.\n\nIn addition to high(ish) centralization, Solana has experienced 5 major and 9 partial network outages in 2022 alone, which leads many to question the reliability of the network.\n\nSolana price prediction for 2023-2024: A bull run next year?\n\nOur algorithm forecasts Solana price to mount a rally in 2024 and double its previous ATH.\n\nAccording to CoinCodex\u2019s price prediction algorithm, Solana will see a prolonged period of sideways movement in 2023. The snapshot of technical indicators as of early February shows 7 bullish and 23 bearish signals.\n\nIn addition, with a current price of $23, Solana is trading below the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), both of which are considered bearish signs.\n\nHowever, the algorithm projects a major trend reversal in early 2024, with SOL increasing past its previous ATH of $260 to reach a new peak of $536. Keep in mind that the Solana (SOL) price prediction could change considerably over time, especially if the underlying indicators undergo significant changes.\n\nThe bottom line: Is Solana a good buy in 2023?\n\nSolana is currently in a peculiar spot \u2013 there are strong indications that the network is showing robust organic growth as both DeFi and NFT use has increased in the past couple of months, despite the border downturn in crypto markets. At the same time, the network is still hurting from last year\u2019s price collapse fueled by the FTX connection and the bear market.\n\nWhether Solana is a good buy depends mostly on your own risk profile. Due to the uncertainty of what the future will bring, investing in Solana should be done if you are comfortable with an elevated level of risk. Still, buying Solana could be a promising long-term crypto investment.\n\nIf you are looking to diversify your portfolio among different smart contract platforms, check out our Is Ethereum a good investment article.\n\nFor more information, check out our ultimate guide on cryptocurrency investing for useful tips and ideas on how to approach investing in crypto.\n\nInvest in Solana"
