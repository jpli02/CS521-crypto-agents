        "title": "Solana plans expansion into Brazil with $10 million investment - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nThe Solana Foundation plans to bring its ecosystem-building efforts to Brazil in 2023 through a substantial investment. The non-profit organization behind the Solana blockchain network declared intentions to inject over $10 million into Brazilian Web3 initiatives spanning tokenized assets, AI, and the arts.\n\n\u201cOur intention at the Solana Foundation is to have a diminishing influence on the ecosystem and empower our community to lead the future of Solana,\u201d said Diego Dias, Head of the Brazilian and Latam groups.\n\nUnder the expansion, Solana will sponsor the formation of a \u201csuperteam\u201d in Brazil \u2013 similar to dedicated developer groups it has already backed in seven other countries. According to Dias, these superteams originated as decentralized autonomous organizations but now serve as worldwide extensions of the Foundation.\n\nBeyond establishing a local team, Solana targets three critical areas for its Brazilian investments: tokenization, AI, and digital art. Through the expansion, the Foundation intends to put the Brazilian community at the forefront of innovation within the Solana ecosystem while diminishing its influence. Dias said empowering users to shape the blockchain\u2019s future remains the goal as Solana spreads globally.\n\nThis expansion into Brazil coincides with Solana\u2019s recent token appreciation. In 2023, SOL outperformed Ethereum in trading volumes on decentralized exchanges and had a staggering 700% increase in value."

        "content": "Solana-based USD Coin (USDC) transaction volume surpassed that of USDT on the Tron blockchain, according to data from blockchain intelligence platform Artemis.\n\nData from the platform shows that Solana USDC transfer volume reached more than $60 billion on Jan. 1, while that of Tron USDT was around $34 billion.\n\nThis continues a trend observed in December when Solana USDC\u2019s monthly transfer volume was nearly that of Tron\u2019s USDT. Per Artemis data, Solana USDC saw $24.58 billion in volume, while Tron\u2019s USDT was $6.54 billion.\n\nUSDT and USDC are the top two largest stablecoins by market capitalization. These stablecoins account for nearly 90% of the industry supply and trading volume.\n\nCircle\u2019s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, expressed excitement at the milestone, noting that it was only the beginning of the year. Circle is USDC\u2019s issuer.\n\n\u201cIncredible! What\u2019s even more incredible is that it\u2019s only Jan 2nd, imagine where we\u2019ll be a year from now,\u201d Allaire said.\n\nCryptoSlate had previously identified that Solana-based USDC contributed a significant portion of trading activities on decentralized exchanges. At the time, Allaire stated that 90% of all stablecoin transaction volume on Solana was USDC.\n\nSolana\u2019s thriving ecosystem\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain ecosystem is enjoying a resurgence that has helped it regain a pole position within the crypto industry.\n\nThe blockchain ecosystem has experienced significant growth despite its past connections with Sam Bankman-Fried, the embattled FTX founder. This development has led to an influx of new users and crucial partnerships with major global financial entities such as Visa and Shopify.\n\nFurthermore, Solana\u2019s DeFi sector has witnessed remarkable expansion, resulting in an unprecedented surge for its blockchain-based tokens like Helium\u2019s HNT.\n\nData from CryptoSlate shows Solana\u2019s native SOL token closed last year as one of the top-performing assets, up more than 850% to a peak of $120. However, it has retraced to $98 as of press time.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "We do the research, you get the alpha! Get exclusive reports and access to key insights on airdrops, NFTs, and more! Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game! Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA new Solana project called \u201cLess Fn Gas\u201d captured the attention of Crypto Twitter earlier this week when it airdropped 40% of its LFG token supply to Ethereum users.\n\nIt was a ploy to entice Ethereum maxis to give Solana a try\u2014hop over the proverbial fence, see that the grass on the SOL DeFi field might actually be greener, and, well, spend less f\u2019n gas. (That is, of course, spend less on transaction fees, which can be quite expensive on Ethereum.)\n\nAnd despite soaring to a $129 million fully diluted market cap, and then crashing down to around $25 million once the hype began to fade, the team behind the project isn\u2019t stopping there. They\u2019re now planning a second airdrop\u2014one that will be even more inclusive than the first\u2014and establish a grants program for Ethereum devs who make the switch to Solana, a pseudonymous core team member of LFG tells Decrypt.\n\nOver 50,000 ETH users claimed the LFG airdrop within the first 24 hours of the token launching on Monday. Wormhole, a popular bridge between Ethereum and Solana saw $35 million in volume the same day\u2014the first time it\u2019s seen an increase since Solana meme coins started cooling down last week. It apparently burned too hot too fast, though, and the token is now down roughly 80% from its peak on Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the pseudonymous devs behind LFG, who goes by Bobby Axelrod (borrowing the name and likeness of the character from the Showtime series \u201cBillions\u201d), told Decrypt that he\u2019s spoken with high-profile members of the Solana community about building a project to bring Ethereum users over to Solana.\n\n\u201cI don't know how many of the 50,000 users that claimed are genuinely new to Solana, but judging by how many DMs I have asking how to set up a damn Phantom wallet, I\u2019d guess there\u2019s a lot,\u201d he said, referring to the popular Solana wallet Phantom.\n\nThe project got the attention of some of the key thought leaders from the Solana community, including Kyle Salmani, Multicoin Capital founder, and even Solana\u2019s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko.\n\n\ud83d\udc09\ud83d\udc09\ud83d\udc32 check all links and always use a burner wallet https://t.co/BCUOZp3VOy \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) January 2, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEth people This is a good reason to try solana. Even if for no other reason than to insta sell https://t.co/3YYCzlAiwq \u2014 Integrated Kyle e/acc (@KyleSamani) January 1, 2024\n\nUnfortunately, scammers also noticed the quickly surging token and posted phishing links in the replies to tweets about the project. If you\u2019ve spent any amount of time on Crypto Twitter, you know this happens all the time. But this one managed to fool the CEO and co-founder of Nest Wallet, Bill Lou, who fell victim to the wallet-draining scam.\n\nI'm devastated guys... I just got scammed out of $125k of stEth while trying to claim the $LFG airdrop. And I'm a fking founder of a wallet startup that's trying to improve wallet security... I can't believe this is happening, I've always been so careful. I saw article guide to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/x56HR2z8xK \u2014 Bill Lou (@BillLou95) January 2, 2024\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Crypto Twitter from degening.\n\ndidn't get drained what a start to the new year https://t.co/o2Ho9IuXpA pic.twitter.com/oirz8nyBC2 \u2014 DeeZe \ud83e\udee1 (@DeeZe) January 1, 2024\n\nPopular pseudonymous crypto trader Deeze took to Twitter to show he had claimed his airdrop, and fellow trader 0xQuit put out a thread featuring a brief security audit where the token contract was declared safe.\n\n3/ On the SOL side, you'll see something like this: I will not pretend to be an expert on the SVM, but the transaction looks fairly straight forward. If you want to be safe, claim using a fresh Solana wallet. pic.twitter.com/CBJJzKme6E \u2014 quit (\ud83d\udc40,\ud83e\udd84) (@0xQuit) January 1, 2024\n\nSo what\u2019s next for LFG? \u2018Tis the season for airdrops, so more is on the way, Axelrod says. The first one was limited to Ethereum wallets that had spent more than $4,269 in gas during the last 12 months. The next one will target a wider audience\u2014users only will have to have spent $1,000 in gas to be eligible. Additionally, LFG will be airdropping tokens to a few additional buckets including developers on Ethereum who have deployed a smart contract, users who have interacted with major Solana protocols, and people who put up liquidity for the LFG token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAxelrod said the LFG project is now also focused on bringing Ethereum developers to Solana. \u201cA big part of this [second] airdrop is going to be geared towards people who have deployed contracts on Ethereum,\u201d he said.\n\nThe LFG dev added that Less Fn Gas also plans to use a portion of its treasury to start a decentralized grants program. Ethereum developers will be able to apply for grants, paid in LFG, to build on Solana.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the project has legs, given how far it\u2019s fallen from its peak already. But with so many prominent figures from the Solana ecosystem seemingly rooting for it, anything is possible.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."
