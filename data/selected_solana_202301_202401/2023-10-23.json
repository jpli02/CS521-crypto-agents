        "content": "Digital assets manager CoinShares says Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) is an institutional favorite as the crypto market boils over with Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) fervor.\n\nIn its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, CoinShares finds that institutional investors have poured more money into Solana than any other non-BTC digital asset over the last week and year.\n\n\u201cSolana saw a further US$15.5m inflows last week, bringing year-to-date inflows to US$74m (47% of AuM [assets under management]) \u2014 making it the most popular altcoin this year so far.\u201d\n\nOverall, the digital assets markets saw their fourth week of institutional inflows in a row. According to CoinShares, some of the momentum may come from a growing anticipation of the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.\n\n\u201cDigital asset investment products saw inflows for the 4th consecutive week totaling US$66m. Total AuM has now risen to US$33bn.\n\nWhile the most recent inflows are likely linked to excitement over a spot bitcoin ETF launch in the US, they are relatively low in comparison to June announcements, suggesting more caution from investors this time around.\u201d\n\nBTC institutional investment products raked in over $55 million in inflows last week, while short BTC products took in $1.6 million.\n\nWhile altcoins Binance Coin (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) enjoyed minor inflows of $0.2 million and $0.1 million respectively, Ethereum (ETH) products bled out $7.4 million.\n\n\u201cContinued concerns over Ethereum have led to further outflows of US$7.4m, the only altcoin to see outflows last week.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Two of the largest and most structurally important Solana DeFi protocol frontends have geofenced UK users.\n\nThe developments come amid continued uncertainty regarding the regulatory requirements of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the country\u2019s finance markets regulator.\n\nFrontends are web portals commonly used to interact with DeFi protocols, and are often maintained by the protocol development teams. In recent months, frontends have become a focal point for crypto regulation \u2014 and the geofencing moves highlight how they may act as a point of centralization for the industry.\n\nReports emerged on Monday that Solana liquid staking provider Marinade Finance and Solana-based DEX Orca Finance had both geoblocked UK users. The blocks were first reported by CoinDesk.\n\nUsing a VPN, Blockworks attempted to access Marinade Finance from a UK IP address, and was met with a message saying \u201cAccess to this site is unavailable in the United Kingdom due to compliance concerns relating to rules and regulations promulgated by the UK Finance Conduct Authority.\u201d\n\nThe text went on to note that users could still \u201cwithdraw liquidity, claim delayed tickets or delay unstake\u201d using the protocols SDK.\n\nWhen attempting to access Orca Finance\u2019s site, Blockworks encountered an identical message.\n\nAccording to data from DeFiLlama, Solana accounts for $1.2 billion in total value locked (TVL). Marinade Finance, Solana\u2019s largest liquid staking project, has $243 million in TVL, while Orca, the chain\u2019s largest DEX, has $48.5 million in TVL.\n\nBinance UK announced last week that it would stop accepting new customers, citing FCA warnings issued to a partner firm. Additionally, earlier in October the FCA issued warnings to 146 unregistered crypto firms regarding new promotional and advertising rules.\n\nThe FCA said in February that roughly 15% of applicant firms are successful in registering.\n\nOrca and Marinade are not the only protocols to geofence specific user populations in recent months.\n\nCelestia announced in September that Americans would be banned from claiming the project\u2019s TIA token, and dapps such as 1inch have geofenced American users since as far back as 2021.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The network also saw another outage in late January and had a 96.4% uptime during the month.\n\nAnd just last month, the Solana blockchain suffered an outage caused by bots trying to trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the network.\n\nWhile Solana outages are no longer out of the ordinary, there was still a fair amount of backlash coming from the community. \u201cGet it together Solana. We should be past this already. I\u2019m big believer but I\u2019m even doubting at this point,\u201d one Twitter user said.\n\nSimilar sentiments. @solana needs to pick up their shit.

        "content": "SOL\u2019s Stunning Performance, Investment Surges, and Its Role in the Crypto Landscape\n\nSolana (SOL) experiences a remarkable 38% price surge, reaching $31.38 per token.\n\nInvestment flows into Solana-related products skyrocket by 420% in a week, totaling $15.5 million.\n\nThe crypto landscape witnesses growing interest in innovative blockchain technologies, with Solana emerging as a potential competitor to established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nSolana (SOL) embarked on an astonishing price rally, surging by a whopping 38%. This remarkable leap has propelled SOL\u2019s value to $31.38 per token, a level that hadn\u2019t been witnessed since the middle of July. This price surge didn\u2019t go unnoticed; it created a significant buzz in the market, making Solana one of the most talked-about assets in the digital currency sphere. It\u2019s a testament to Solana\u2019s growing prominence and the attention it\u2019s drawing as a notable player in the crypto world.\n\nSolana-oriented products have witnessed an unprecedented wave of investments, marking a significant turn of events in the crypto landscape. In just a single week, the inflow of funds into these Solana-related products skyrocketed, recording a remarkable surge of 420%. This surge amounted to an impressive $15.5 million. This substantial influx of capital demonstrates the growing confidence and interest in Solana, as investors flock to capitalize on its recent success.\n\nThis surge in investments is a stark contrast to the experience of other cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum. Ethereum faced outflows totaling $7.4 million, largely due to concerns surrounding the security of its network. While Ethereum grappled with security apprehensions, Solana\u2019s extraordinary performance lured a surge of investments, emphasizing the shifting dynamics within the crypto market.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nBroader Crypto Investment Landscape\n\nThe crypto investment landscape is witnessing a positive trend, especially in digital asset investment products. These products have enjoyed a streak of four consecutive weeks with inflows, accumulating a substantial total of $66 million. When you combine these four weeks, the sum reaches an impressive $179 million in inflows.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that this recent inflow, while promising, is viewed in the context of cautious investor sentiment. CoinShares analyst James Butterfill points out that despite these positive developments, it\u2019s essential to recognize that the recent inflows are not quite at the level of the initial frenzy that followed BlackRock\u2019s announcement back in June. This suggests that investors, though optimistic, are approaching the crypto market with a degree of caution, perhaps learning from past market volatility and uncertainty.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nSolana\u2019s Role in the Crypto Landscape\n\nSolana\u2019s recent performance underscores the burgeoning interest in innovative blockchain technologies, with Solana shining at the forefront of this movement. Its surge and the influx of investments into Solana-related products are indicative of a growing appetite for alternative blockchain platforms beyond the established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAs Solana continues to capture attention and investments, there\u2019s speculation about its ability to sustain its current momentum and go head-to-head with the well-entrenched players in the crypto realm. Can Solana emerge as a formidable competitor, challenging the dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum? The answer to this question will be closely watched in the coming months.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "title": "Here Are 3 Reasons Why Solana (SOL) Is Pumping - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Key highlights:\n\nSOL plummeted more than other mahor cryptos during the FTX crash. It seems the market overcorrected, and now SOL is bouncing back to make up for lost ground.\n\nSolana's been scoring some big partnerships recently \u2013 case in point, they hooked up with Shopify so merchants can accept crypto payments quickly and cheaply using SOL.\n\nSolana's decentralized finance apps, or DeFi for short, have tripled users in just a few months.\n\nSolana (SOL) has been on an impressive run over the past few weeks. The price of the SOL token has surged over 38% in the last 7 days alone. This has led many in the crypto community to wonder \u2013 what's causing this pump?\n\nIn this article, we'll explore 3 key reasons why Solana is seeing such strong price action right now.\n\nReason 1: Solana was oversold during the FTX crash\n\nThe first reason SOL is pumping right now is because it was heavily oversold during the FTX implosion. When FTX went bankrupt, the price of SOL crashed a whopping 79% in a matter of weeks. After the decline in the FTX crash, all investors had only one question in mind: Will Solana Recover?\n\nThis brutal sell-off was driven by forced liquidations of FTX/Alameda's SOL holdings. But here's the thing \u2013 Solana didn't have any direct involvement in FTX's shady dealings, at least as far as what\u2019s publicly known. It could be argued that the sell-off was irrational and pushed SOL price far below its true value.\n\nNow that the crypto market sentiment is improving, SOL is bouncing back more aggressively than other top cryptos. It's making up for lost ground and correcting the oversold conditions.\n\nReason 2: A wave of positive developments in the SOL ecosystem\n\nThere have also been some legitimately positive developments for Solana in recent weeks that are fueling the rally.\n\nIn late August, Solana launched an integration with Shopify that allows merchants to accept crypto payments settled in USDC on the Solana blockchain. Over 1 million Shopify stores now have access to fast, low-cost Solana payments.\n\n1/ ?\ufe0fShopify ?Solana Pay\n\n\n\nToday, Solana Pay integrates with @Shopify, empowering the millions of entrepreneurs and merchants on Shopify to accept fast, web3 native payments with no transaction fees through the end of 2023. https://t.co/q63KeBllXB\n\n\n\nLearn more ? pic.twitter.com/QEb1LzqS51 \u2014 Solana (@solana) August 23, 2023\n\nShortly after, Visa announced it was using USDC on Solana for its new cross-border settlement network. This could dramatically improve the efficiency of Visa's global payment operations.\n\nThese are just two examples of real-world Solana adoption happening right now. The more its blockchain technology is utilized, the higher demand grows for the SOL token.\n\nReason 3: Surging DeFi activity\n\nBeyond price and partnership news, we're also seeing a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Solana that is boosting confidence in the ecosystem.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, the total value locked in Solana DeFi has tripled since the start of 2023, surging from $214 million to over $654 million currently.\n\nSolana TVL. Image source: DeFiLlama\n\nAs Ethereum gas fees remain high, developers are turning to SOL's high-speed, low-cost blockchain for their DeFi applications. This increase in platform usage increases the utility and value of the SOL token.\n\nThe growth of Solana's DeFi ecosystem shows that developers still see a bright future despite the FTX fiasco.\n\nSOL still has room to run\n\nGiven these developments, analysts generally agree that Solana still has room to run. The CoinCodex algorithm predicts SOL will rise another 65% by year's end to hit $47.\n\nOf course, a broader crypto rally would provide a significant tailwind. But even in neutral markets, Solana appears poised to continue outperforming. Its blockchain activity is expanding and the price has corrected from irrational lows.\n\nMany investors state that they invest in Solana for the long term because they trust its technology and team. You can also find Solana price prediction for 2040-2050 in our article."
