        "content": "Eddie's New Dream \u00a9 Benoit Photo\n\nReddam Racing\u2019s homebred gray Eddie\u2019s New Dream sat in the garden for virtually all of the one-mile grass run that was Friday\u2019s Solana Beach Stakes at Del Mar, then accelerated come stretch time and pulled away to a length and a quarter tally in the $151,000 California-bred headliner.\n\nThe winner, a 5-year-old daughter of Square Eddie, was registering the eighth victory of her career and earned a first prize of $85,500. She also has eight seconds and four thirds from 26 starts and now has earnings of $705,580.\n\nFinal time for the race was 1:36.16 and the winner returned $7.20 to win for her backers.\n\nEddie\u2019s New Dream was piloted by her regular guy, Mario Gutierrez, and is trained by Ben Cecil.\n\nFinishing second was Nick Alexander\u2019s Rose Maddox, who had a head on Smolich or Smolich\u2019s Chancery Way, who had cut out all the fractions in the affair.\n\nThe track\u2019s popular Pick Six wager was not solved once again and now will offer a carryover of $183,777 heading into Saturday\u2019s 11-race card. First post is 2 p.m.\n\nMARIO GUTIERREZ (Eddie\u2019s New Dream, winner) \u2013 \u201cUsually she\u2019s up in the bit, but today she was happy right where she was; nice and relaxed. As she\u2019s gotten older, she\u2019s gotten better. She\u2019s real mature now and she\u2019s real good. She one of those ones that you like to ride.\u201d\n\nJ. PAUL REDDAM (Owner/Breeder) (Eddie\u2019s New Dream, winner) \u2013 \u201cWe thought the one (horse, Chancery Way) had a lot of speed and the idea was if she broke out of there well we would just track her. Plans rarely work out, but this time they did. It looked to me like he (Gutierrez) measured her well; he didn\u2019t move too early which sometimes, when you think you\u2019re the best, that can happen in a turf race. When she rolled up (alongside the leader) I thought: \u2018Ok, here we go.\u2019\u201d\n\nFRACTIONS: :22.92 :47.39 1:12.65 1:24.35 1:36.16\n\nThe stakes win was the first of the meet for both rider Gutierrez and trainer Cecil.\n\nThe stakes win was the first in the Solana Beach for rider Gutierrez, but his 19th overall at Del Mar.\n\nThe stakes win was the second (Poteen in 2019) for trainer Cecil and his 16th overall.\n\nThe winning owner and breeder is J. Paul Reddam of Laguna Beach, CA."

        "content": "SOL\n\nSolana has shown promising signs of making a recovery in the industry. However, with the market\u2019s volatility, users should exercise caution.\n\nSummary\n\nSolana endured a challenging 2022, facing network troubles and NFT departures that led to a significant drop in SOL's price.\n\nPromising indicators suggest a potential recovery for Solana, with improved scalability, a thriving DeFi and NFT ecosystem, and strong developer and investor support.\n\nDespite positive signs, caution is advised due to market volatility. Solana's rebound remains uncertain, though it stands poised to attract new users and developers.\n\nSolana faced a tough year in 2022, encountering network outages, links to the FTX crypto exchange's collapse, and the departure of NFT collections like DeGods and y00ts to other blockchains. Consequently, the SOL price plummeted by over 90% from its peak of $260.06.\n\nThat said, there have been some promising signs for optimism as the protocol looks to re-establish itself as a leading player in the Layer 1 ecosystem. As of writing, Solana trades at $20.70, but is there a chance for a potential bull run? This article explores the blockchain\u2019s progress and potential for a positive recovery.\n\nReasons for optimism around Solana\n\n1. Enhanced Scalability and Reliability\n\nSolana has taken significant strides in improving its scalability and reliability. Transactions per second (TPS) have notably increased, and the network has enjoyed months free of significant outages.\n\nSolana maintained 4K+ TPS in the last seven days | Solscan\n\n2. Thriving DeFi and NFT Ecosystem\n\nSolana remains a favored platform for DeFi and NFT projects. Its vibrant community of developers and users keeps it bustling with activity.\n\n\u200d\n\n3. Strong Developer and Investor Support\n\nA robust team of developers and investors backs Solana, with the Solana Foundation dedicated to long-term project success.\n\nPositive Indicators in Recent Months\n\nSolana has recently exhibited some impressive metrics. Solana\u2019s TVL has recovered somewhat from lows of around $200 million, in late 2022, to now reach approximately the $310 million mark, according to data from DefiLlama. Certainly, this remains magnitudes lower than highs of more than $10 billion in November 2022, but a more than 50% increase in just a handful of months is no small feat.\n\nAdditionally, the count of daily active addresses on Solana has been encouraging, with over 240,000 active wallet addresses recorded in a week. The Layer1 blockchain, designed for mass adoption, also observed more than 350,000 unique wallet addresses interacting with it sometime in August.\n\nNumber of daily active addresses in the last seven days | Solscan\n\nThe Path Ahead for Solana\n\nThese positive trends position Solana as a prominent player in the blockchain ecosystem. Still, it's premature to determine if the project will fully recover from past setbacks. The market's volatility and various influencing factors could sway SOL's price.\n\nNonetheless, Solana is poised to attract new users and developers, reestablishing its influence in the DeFi and NFT sectors.\n\nBalancing Optimism with Caution\n\nOverall, a mix of optimism and caution shrouds Solana's future. While its potential is evident, challenges need overcoming for it to thrive truly. Time holds the key to whether Solana can achieve a rebound in 2023 and beyond."
