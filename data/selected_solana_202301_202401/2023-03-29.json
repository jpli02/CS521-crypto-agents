        "content": "The crypto market is on the verge of another bull run as we head toward the end of a very successful Q1. That quarter began with a bull run and it looks like it could be the same for Q2, that is even after news that the Federal Open Market Committee made to increase interest rates by 25 points. This isn't a huge increase but also isn't what the market would have been hoping for, it is predicted that the inflation level will be around 5.1% by the end of the year."

        "content": "Kelli Pease created The Flower Remedy, which gifts home-grown bouquets to people to help spark joy.\n\nWith a goal to give away a million flowers, The Flower Remedy in Solana Beach is blooming with each stunning bouquet it donates to people who need an extra dose of happiness.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started to give away flowers, it became kind of an addiction,\u201d said founder Kelli Pease, a marketing director who learned to garden from her grandmother. \u201cI wanted to dedicate a part of my life to bringing joy to people.\u201d\n\nPease began gardening in earnest during the early days of the pandemic to help ease her anxiety. Starting with just two beds in her backyard, she became hooked on flowers once her first dahlia bloomed.\n\nThe idea for The Flower Remedy started to grow soon after. The first home-grown bouquet Pease delivered was to a neighbor whose son had died. The connection that the gift sparked was \u201ca beautiful experience,\u201d Pease said.\n\nThe Flower Remedy now has 13 garden beds that sprout ranunculus, cosmos, anemones, snapdragons and other flowers. Pease and a group of volunteers pick stems, create arrangements and deliver bouquets across town to individuals, senior homes and healthcare facilities.\n\nExtra blooms donated by local farms and gardeners are used for random acts of kindness. Pease and her team spontaneously give free flowers to people walking on nearby trails in the hopes of brightening up someone\u2019s day.\n\nThe Flower Remedy doesn\u2019t sell flowers, but in January Pease released her first related product: The Flowering Conversation Deck, a collection of 50 cards, each with a watercolor flower and a conversation-starter question. Priced under $30, the deck helps people \u201cform deeper connections with each other\u201d and is available at shops like Native Poppy and on The Flower Remedy website.\n\nFor information about volunteering or to suggest someone in need of a bouquet, visit floweremedy.co or follow @theflowerremedy on Instagram.\n\nRoxana Becerril is a freelance writer.\n\n"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana profile picture (PFP) collection y00ts is the most prominent NFT project to date to migrate from one chain to another\u2014and early data suggests the community of holders is supporting the move, with nearly 77% of the NFTs already migrated to Polygon since the late Monday launch.\n\nDeLabs, the Web3 startup behind both y00ts and the even more valuable DeGods project on Solana, announced in December that both collections would undergo the process of \u201cbridging\u201d to a new blockchain in the coming months\u2014y00ts to Polygon and DeGods to Ethereum. Both moves were ultimately set for March.\n\nLate Monday night, DeLabs and associated tech startup Dust Labs launched the migration for y00ts, which is effectively a \u201cburn and mint\u201d process that sees holders burn (or destroy) the original Solana version of the NFT and receive a newly-minted Polygon version on the other end of the Wormhole-based bridge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn just over 24 hours, more than 75% of the total supply of y00ts NFTs (11,362 out of 15,000) had reportedly already been migrated to Polygon. As of this writing, less than two days after the migration tool launched, the tally stands at 11,506 migrated NFTs\u2014or nearly 77% of the total collection.\n\nBased on the current 1.79 ETH ($3,230) floor price at the OpenSea marketplace\u2014or the price of the cheapest listed NFT in the project\u2014that represents nearly $37 million worth of NFTs that had moved chains in just over a day. And since some of the NFTs are valued higher than the floor, the actual tally is potentially much higher.\n\nYou can now migrate your y00ts to Polygon.https://t.co/pORyvNw3S7 pic.twitter.com/iYSpBF68hp \u2014 y00ts (@y00tsNFT) March 28, 2023\n\nDeLabs has incentivized holders to make the move swiftly. Anyone who migrated to Polygon within the first 24 hours would have network gas fees reimbursed by marketplace Magic Eden, plus they\u2019d receive $5 in USDC stablecoin for listing the Polygon-based NFT on the same marketplace. Furthermore, they\u2019d have fee-free y00ts trading for 30 days.\n\nOn top of that, DeLabs said it would randomly airdrop a free Bitcoin-based DeGods NFT (or Ordinal) to one of the y00ts holders who migrated within the first 24 hours. On the flip side, NFT holders who don\u2019t migrate to Polygon by April 3 will be hit by a 33.3% \u201cPaper Hands Bridge Tax\u201d creator royalty fee on secondary sales\u201410 times the standard rate set by DeLabs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLeaving Solana\n\nDeLabs and Dust Labs plan to carry through with the other half of the plan this week, as DeGods will commence migration from Solana to the Ethereum blockchain on March 31st.\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with Decrypt in February, DeLabs founder Rohun \u201dFrank\u201d Vora and Dust Labs CEO Kevin Henrikson spoke at length about the team\u2019s intentions to migrate both y00ts and DeGods away from the Solana blockchain, in favor of Polygon and Ethereum, respectively.\n\nFrank revealed that the lure of y00ts to Polygon didn\u2019t originate from the $3 million grant paid by Polygon Labs, but rather the roster of corporate giants building on the network\u2014including Reddit, Disney, Nike, and Starbucks, among others.\n\nEnvisioning easier accessibility to forge partnerships with Polygon-native brands, Frank revealed that the visual design of the y00ts avatars was created with the possibility for brands to \u201cimprint their logos.\"\n\nIn the case of DeGods, Henrikson said that \u201cit wasn't about if, it was just a matter of when\u201d the collection would move to Ethereum. \u201cIf we're gonna be the biggest, most popular NFT collection in the world, you're gonna have to be on Ethereum,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to take big swings, and we are trying to do it in a way that is going to make it exciting on the upside for people to participate,\u201d Frank said in February, teasing the types of incentives that ultimately accompanied the y00ts migration.\n\nTeasing the DeGods move ahead, Frank tweeted today: \u201cFriday gonna be iconic.\u201d"
