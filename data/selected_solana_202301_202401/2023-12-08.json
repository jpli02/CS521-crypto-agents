        "content": "Solana-based liquid staking project Jito\u2019s JTO token price soared more than 80% following its trading debut across multiple major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.\n\nData from CoinMarketCap shows that JTO\u2019s value surged to more than $3 during the past day, representing an 85% growth for the newly launched digital asset. JTO\u2019s price has retraced to $2.90 as of press time.\n\nJTO\u2019s market capitalization stood at $333 million as of press time, with a trading volume of $1.4 billion.\n\nJito airdrop\n\nOn Dec. 7, Jito distributed 90 million units of its governance token, JTO, to its early adopters as part of an airdrop program. While the total allocation for the airdrop is 100 million tokens, representing 10% of the token\u2019s total supply, users can claim their share of the 90 million over the next 18 months.\n\nMeanwhile, the token\u2019s airdrop strategy gained attention from the crypto community as it mostly favored regular users. Observers suggested that this approach would benefit Solana\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, encouraging more retail traders\u2019 participation.\n\nDan Smith, a researcher at Blockworks, hailed the airdrop as a pivotal moment for drawing people into crypto through its innovative reward structure. Smith highlighted the broad participation, saying:\n\n\u201c9,852 addresses claimed between $9.8k and $208k from the Jito airdrop today. All you had to do to qualify for tier 1 was play around with $40 onchain, and you walked away with $9,882 a few months later.\u201d\n\nThe JTO token"

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nInvestment manager VanEck expects Solana to join the crypto spot ETF wars in 2024 as stated by analysts Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush in a new report published today: \u201cSolana will join the spot ETF wars thanks to a flurry of asset managers submitting filings.\u201d\n\nThe analysts expect Solana to become a top 3 blockchain by market capitalization, total value locked (TVL), and active users within the next two years.\n\nIn 2021, VanEck launched a Solana exchange-traded note (ETN) on the German stock exchange Deutsche B\u00f6rse, signaling its conviction in Solana\u2019s long-term potential. If its spot ETF prediction materializes, it will legitimize Solana and allow mainstream investors easier access to SOL and other tokens in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nA growing number of asset managers are seeking regulatory approval to bring crypto ETFs to market. BlackRock, Fidelity, and HashDex have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission in recent months to bring Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. Approval of these ETFs could pave the way for acceptance of funds tracking newer tokens like Solana.\n\nSolana\u2019s DeFi comeback\n\nIn the report, VanEck also predicted that Solana\u2019s Pyth price oracle could flip dominant leader Chainlink in terms of total value secured.\n\n\u201cAs TVL continues to grow across high-throughput chains (like Solana) and Chainlink struggles to find institutional adoption of its LINK token, we expect Pyth to gain meaningful market share,\u201d VanEck\u2019s digital assets team wrote.\n\nSolana\u2019s TVL has witnessed robust growth this year, rising over 160% in the past month to nearly $860 million, according to data from DefiLlama. However, these figures are still considerably less than their $10 billion peak reached in November 2021.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token, SOL, has surged over 25% in the past week, trading around $73 at press time according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "Solana has surged over 430% this year, going from $10 in January to over $70 at press time. While SOL and the overall ecosystem have flourished in 2023, the same cannot be said for Saga, Solana\u2019s mobile device.\n\nSales of Solana\u2019s Web3 smartphone, Saga, have been disappointing, prompting internal discussions about its future, according to founder Anatoly Yakovenko. Unless sales see a significant improvement, Yakovenko suggested that Solana\u2019s next device might be a lower-priced \u201csmart wallet.\u201d\n\nNotsofast, a popular crypto influencer on X, recently shared a screenshot showing a percentage increase of Solana\u2019s popular dog-themed coin, BONK, through an index called Saga Book, which tracks the value of Saga airdrop as a percentage cost of the phone.\n\nThe phone cost $1000 and was announced in April. It came with an airdrop of $10 worth of BONK tokens. By that time, BONK was priced at around $0.0000004. That number is now $0.00001154, representing a whopping 10338.75% price appreciation.\n\nherein we track the #sagabonk index at 29.45% the @solanamobile saga phone came with an airdrop of $10 worth of BONK tokens the phone cost $1000 the #sagabonk index tracks the value of that airdrop as a % cost of the phone we want the BONK to pay for the phone pic.twitter.com/1JcrYznFEb \u2014 notsofast (@notsofast) December 7, 2023\n\nFounder Admits Not Using His Own Saga Phone\n\nWhen asked about the phone\u2019s quality and performance, notsofast said, \u201cit\u2019s ok,\u201d and that it wasn\u2019t the greatest value for dollars.\n\nSaga was designed to enhance the Web3 mobile experience but has faced challenges due to better mobile interfaces on regular smartphones, which ironically make Web3 navigation easier. Yakovenko said that Saga\u2019s sales fell short of expectations while admitting to using Saga as his \u201cNFT phone,\u201d but for everyday business, he relies on his iPhone.\n\nDuring an interview, Anatoly Yakovenko acknowledged that advancements in mobile interfaces, such as Progressive Web Apps and pass keys, have narrowed the gap between specialized crypto smartphones and regular ones.\n\nAll in all, the entrepreneur seemed discouraged as he mentioned the limited success of previous attempts by companies, from major players like HTC to smaller ones like Sirin Labs, in creating crypto-focused smartphones.\n\nSOL and BONK on Fire\n\nSOL and BONK are two of this week\u2019s largest crypto gainers. The dog-themed token exploded over 700% in the past 30 days, highlighting the appetite for hot memecoins in the market.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana has recorded a price surge of nearly 20% in just seven days and 500% year-to-date. As reported, analysts are optimistic about SOL\u2019s future growth, with predictions ranging from new all-time highs of $300 to $1,000."
