        "title": "Husband and wife, chef and farmer duo bring farm-to-table goodness to Solana Beach's Vino Carta - Del Mar Times",
        "content": "Megan Strom, the farmer, and her husband Juan Gonzalez the chef of Mesa Agricola.\n\nThe husband-and-wife, farmer-and-chef team behind Mesa Agricola now has a weekly kitchen residency at Solana Beach\u2019s Vino Carta wine shop and bar.\n\nMegan Strom, the farmer, and her husband Juan Gonzalez, the chef, take over the kitchen every Monday and Tuesday night from 5-9 p.m., serving up a soulful menu of farm-to-table cuisine. The couple\u2019s concept fits perfectly with Vino Carta, which sells only natural wines made through organic and sustainable farming practices from small, family-run producers.\n\nReservations are strongly recommended as the space can only hold 30 people at a time. Tuesdays have been filling up and Megan and Juan have been satisfyingly slammed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going really well so far, we\u2019re really happy to be working with Vino Carta,\u201d Strom said.\n\nVino Carta is a part of the Bottlecraft family, which has craft beer shops in North Park, Liberty Public Market and Oceanside. The first Vino Carta opened in Little Italy and last year Solana Beach\u2019s Bottlecraft in the Beach Walk Shopping Center made the conversion from beer to wine, becoming the second Vino Carta location.\n\nThe wine shop offers food seven nights a week\u2014Long Story Short, another husband and wife team, takes over the kitchen Wednesdays through Sundays.\n\nA Minnesota native, some might assume Strom grew up on the farm but she was a self-described \u201ccity girl\u201d who worked in restaurants since she was 14. She moved to San Francisco to attend Le Cordon Bleu culinary school and study the front-of-the-house side but eventually moved to the Coachella Valley, where she found and fell in love with farming. She loved being outside and cultivating the valued produce that makes its way into restaurant kitchens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard work but very, very rewarding,\u201d said Strom.\n\nFor the last 13 years, Strom farmed 120 acres in the Coachella Valley. She met and married Gonzalez, a chef from Baja, Mexico and their goal was always a farm-to-table experience that they could run together. The pair launched Mesa Agricola last year doing private farm-to-table dinners\u2014every meal was an adventure and a celebration of the culture of rustic food preparation, lettuce harvested less than 24 hours before it was served for their first course.\n\nMegan Strom, the farmer, and her husband Juan Gonzalez the chef. (Copyright of Mesa Agricola)\n\nMegan and Juan made the move to San Diego when they got an amazing opportunity from Mike Reeske, a bean farmer in Valley Center, to farm a small plot of land. She went from a 120-acre farm to just a quarter acre: \u201cIt is very humbling and I touch every seed and leaf by hand,\u201d she said.\n\nWith Mesa Agricola they had been hosting farm-to-table dinners in the San Diego area and heard of Vino Carta through friends. They started out doing the occasional pop-ups at the Little Italy location before landing the residency in Solana Beach.\n\nOn the farm, Strom grows mostly specialty greens, standard vegetables but the most unique varieties: \u201cI\u2019m a big seed catalog nerd.\u201d She also grows whatever Gonzalez is interested in experimenting with.\n\nShe has grown really cool Spanish hanging tomatoes and varieties of chicories, radicchio and mustard greens. She\u2019s grown bronze fennel, purple peacock broccoli (a crossbreed of kale and broccoli) and has 10 types of garlic in the ground that will be harvested soon.\n\nGonzalez\u2019s culinary style is Baja-Mediterranean cuisine, using whatever is ripe for the picking. Working in restaurants in Los Angeles, he learned a lot about global spices and techniques which he blends with his Baja inspiration. The menu changes every week depending on what\u2019s fresh but a lot of fan favorites stay on the menu like the chicory salad with chicories, pickled red onions, shaved farm apples and Pecorino Romano with a drizzle of kefir milk dressing.\n\nA sample menu last week included roasted mushrooms with crispy leeks; pan-roasted Japanese sweet potatoes with hazelnut crema, serrano chile and fermented honey kaffir lime dressing; and a beet salad with kumquats, mint and pistachios.\n\nMany of their dishes are vegan and gluten-free, but they also do a tuna tlayuda (a traditional Mexican street food made with a large crispy tortilla) and a New York strip steak with black garlic aioli and fresh Mesa Agricola arugula.\n\nDessert options included a chocolate olive oil cake or basque cheesecake with raspberry rhubarb jam.\n\nIn addition to the kitchen residency, the Carlsbad couple is still doing private farm-to-table dinners (called the San Diego Supper Club) and hope to do more\u2014they hosted one recently at Coastal Roots Farm in Encinitas.\n\nAt Vino Carta, Megan and Juan are enjoying their passion project and sharing their bounty with a true farm-to-table experience. The space is cozy, the vegetables are fresh and the plates shareable: \u201cIt\u2019s really something special,\u201d Strom said.\n\nLearn more about Mesa Agricola at mesaagricola.com. Vino Carta is located at 437 N. Highway 101, Solana Beach. For reservations visit vinocartasd.com\n\n"
