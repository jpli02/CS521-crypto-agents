        "content": "BNB and Solana fade as Polygon becomes most popular blockchain for games\n\nSign up to our Substack, follow us on Twitter and connect with us on Linkedin.\n\nAt the halfway mark through 2023 we\u2019re crunching data from the Big Blockchain Game List. First up, we\u2019re looking at the number of blockchain games that have ceased development.\n\n158 blockchain games were discontinued during H1 2023, bringing the total of games that have been taken off the list because they have been discontinued to 248.\n\nBNB experienced the highest number of failures with 39 titles, followed by Polygon (26) and Ethereum (27), although in the case of Ethereum, many of those games have transitioned to other EVM chains. Champions Ascension\u2019s move from Ethereum to Polygon is one high profile example.\n\nSolana lost 24 games: again this isn\u2019t surprising given market conditions.\n\nLooking at the blockchains with the most games, the trend is similar with BNB losing its #1 position to Polygon, which currently has 98 games (12%) compared to BNB\u2019s 80 (10%).\n\nEthereum is third on 10% followed by Solana on 6% and IMX on 5%. Notably, Solana has slipped back from 10% to 6% since November 2022 whilst IMX has seen an increase from 3%.\n\nThe largest gainer is the category Multichain games, which includes games deployed on one or more chains, currently on 17%."

        "content": "Solana-based NFT platform SolSea said that has partnered with Coca-Cola\u2019s Serbian division, Coca-Cola Srbija, on July 5.\n\nSolSea said that the partnership will involve the offer of merchandise as well as Coca-Cola Serbia-branded non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe two companies are offering the NFTs and merch in partnership with EXIT Festival, a summer music festival that takes place annually in Novi Sad, Serbia during the first week of July. The 2023 festival runs between July 6 and July 9.\n\nSolSea also acknowledged a post from the NFT market ALL.ART, which explained the offer in greater detail. ALL.ART said that the offer involves a festival installation called the \u201cMagic Mirror,\u201d which dresses attendees in random merchandise and displays them in real-time 3D. The Magic Mirror installation allows the attendee to take a picture of themselves by scanning a QR code with their mobile device.\n\nThe offer includes 100 exclusive hoodies, which are offered to VIP members and are paired with NFTs. It also includes short-sleeved and sleeveless shirts, though AllArt\u2019s announcement does not indicate that these items have associated NFTs.\n\nCoca-Cola highly involved with NFTs\n\nThe current offer is limited to Coca-Cola\u2019s Serbian division. However, Coca-Cola has been involved with various other NFT projects in the past.\n\nIn July 2021, Coca-Cola auctioned four charity NFTs for International Friendship Day; those NFTs exist on Ethereum (ETH), according to OpenSea records. It also sold a second round of charity NFTs on Polygon (MATIC) to commemorate that date in 2022.\n\nAlso in 2022, Coca-Cola offered Pride Month NFTs for charity, while its Middle East division offered FIFA World Cup Qatar NFTs in partnership with Crypto.com.\n\nOther major brands including Marvel, Starbucks, and Porsche have also begun to work with NFTs. While some critics dismiss corporate NFT offers as \u201ccash grabs,\u201d some sales raise funds for charity and provide opportunities for crypto artists and creators.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Frank DeGods aka Rohun Vora, has passionately worked in the techno-space. With his knowledge, he later used it to found two Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) projects. Solana, a blockchain platform, uses proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism and provides smart contract functionality. He also co-founded DeLabs, a startup company, which created DeGods and y00ts.\n\nFrank DeGods and his Journey\n\nFrank DeGods was working on movie sets when he was teenager. At that point, he was inspired to study film at University of California (UCLA), a public land-grant research university in Los Angeles, California. However, he dropped out and then pursued his entrepreneurial desires.\n\nThe founder of DeGods and y00ts was accepted to the startup fund and program Y Combinator, a startup accelerator company, where he raised $1.3 Million. He then joined a coding boot camp and worked at Main Street, a software development company where he raised an almost $500-Million valuation.\n\nFrank then found the Solana ecosystem quite useful and boosted his knowledge in the blockchain platform. Later in 2021, he established significant clout with the community after starting DeLabs. However, his goals went far beyond the blockchain platform, with DeGods and y00ts poised to become multichain endeavors.\n\nNotably, DeGods left Solana in 2023 for Ethereum while bridging over to Bitcoin as Ordinals Inscriptions. On the other hand, y00ts found a home on another well-known blockchain.\n\nFrank revealed his identity as Rahul Vora in November 2022, as he shared a screenshot from his own Instagram account on his Twitter account. Meanwhile, the web3 community also showed his massive support and welcomed him. Not only this, but the entrepreneurial spirit of Frank also praised his resilience in chasing his tech aspirations, and later on gaining popularity in the NFT space.\n\nFrank DeGods and his Activeness on Twitter\n\nFrank DeGods is quite active on his Twitter account and keeps updating his thoughts on recent happenings. On Rohun Vora\u2019s Twitter account, he shared his recent podcast hosted by NFT Now, a web3 media platform. The long-tailed Twitter thread starts with \u201chis life before DeGods.\u201d\n\nWhat @frankdegods was up to before building a $250M multi-chain empire\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47\n\n\n\n(1/18) pic.twitter.com/8UFtmuR4aP \u2014 topsmoke.eth (@realtopsmoke) May 4, 2023\n\nDuring the podcast, he said \u201cI wanted to write and direct motion pictures, so I applied to all these different film schools. I grew up in LA, and I started working professionally in the film industry when I was 14.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, on a question \u201cWhat was the moment that red-pilled you on entrepreneurship?\u201d Frank answered, \u201cPaul Graham. I remember I was on Reddit and found this Paul Graham essay. I read it and I was like holy fuck. Everything this guy is saying makes so much sense.\u201d\n\nAt the end, Frank added \u201cBy the time we started DeGods, I had four full-time jobs working them all at the same time. I had this core group of friends and we were always scheming like yo let\u2019s start a business, let\u2019s go make a TikTok account, let\u2019s go do something\u2026\u201d"
