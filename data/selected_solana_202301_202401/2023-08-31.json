        "title": "California Highway Patrol releases e-bike safety program as required by Tasha Boerner's AB 1946 - Del Mar Times",
        "content": "Solana Beach City Council recently approved an ordinance to help improve safety for bicyclists. Encinitas and Carlsbad have already adopted similar traffic safety regulations with diversion programs for bicycles.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol released an online e-bike safety program , as required by a state law that the governor signed last year.\n\nThe law, AB 1946, authored by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner, D-Encinitas, was signed by the governor last fall. It gave CHP a September 2023 deadline to release an e-bike program in response to the rise in e-bikes on California roads, which has led to a rise in traffic collisions involving e-bikes .\n\n\u201cI am excited to see the release of the California Highway Patrol\u2019s e-bike training program,\u201d Boerner said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m especially grateful for their time and effort spent collaborating with a diverse group of relevant stakeholders. I hope every e-bike rider takes the time to review e-bike safety, emergency maneuver skills, rules of the road, and other laws related to e-bikes.\u201d\n\nThe online course has 11 sections that cover topics such as proper equipment and gear, rules of the road and bicycle laws, avoiding hazards and best practices.\n\nAB 1946 was approved last year by the state Assembly 73-0, with seven members not voting, and 37-0 in the Senate, with three not voting, before being signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nLocal cities have also been taking steps to improve bicycle safety. Encinitas and Carlsbad have adopted diversion programs, which allow first-time violators to take an approved online safety course when they receive citations on their bicycles or e-bikes. The Solana Beach City Council also recently approved an ordinance , which is pending a second reading next month, that would include a diversion program.\n\nAnother bill by Boerner, AB 530, would require e-bike riders to pass an online test and get a state-issued identification card if they don\u2019t have drivers licenses. The bill, which isn\u2019t headed for the governor\u2019s desk this year, would also ban children 12 and under from riding e-bikes. It has been met with some opposition from e-bike enthusiasts who agree that new riders, especially children, should take to the roads on e-bikes with more education, but also think the requirements in the bill would be overly burdensome.\n\n\u201cHaving photo IDs, getting the DMV involved, I don\u2019t know if it will kill the movement,\u201d Solana Beach resident Karl Rudnick, an instructor with the League of American Bicyclists who teaches e-bike safety classes, said in a recent interview. \u201cNot sure it would change it. I don\u2019t even know how you\u2019d enforce it. Kids don\u2019t run around with ID. It sounds like a nightmare.\u201d\n\nSolana Beach Deputy Mayor David Zito echoed that sentiment during a recent council meeting: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to send all these kids to the DMV, that will kill the movement,\u201d referring to local children who ride their e-bikes to school.\n\nBoerner said in a statement last month that AB 530 is at the start of a \u201clong process\u201d that will continue with meetings this fall.\n\n\u201cAs a mother and a legislator, I believe that we must act to prevent our youth from injuries and educate parents on the promise and responsibility of e-bikes, and AB 530 is another step to increase their safety while sharing the road,\u201d she said in the statement. \u201cNot every parent is a bike rider that can ensure our youth receive proper training.\u201d"

        "content": "As the crypto market volatility bites harder, analysts have sought answers from ChatGPT which highlighted Pomerdoge (POMD), Solana (SOL), and Polkadot (DOT) as tokens investors must invest in for gains.\n\nAs an investor looking for the best possible tokens that'll boost your portfolio and generate massive ROI, you may want to consider these listed tokens from ChatGPT. These tokens, include Solana (SOL) Polkadot (DOT) and Pomerdoge (POMD), and have been shortlisted by the AI due to their massive potential and growth trajectories.\n\nUnlock exclusive access to the latest news on India's general elections, only on the HT App. Download Now! Download Now!\n\nSolana (SOL) Continues Its Bull Run\n\nThe latest price analysis of the Solana (SOL) token has only confirmed ChatGPT's prediction of good things to come for the token. The 24-hour market activity shows that SOL gained a significant 6.43% of its price value. This sees the price of SOL trade at $24.76 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe trading volume of Solana has also experienced a significant 58% increase in market activity within the last 24 hours to see a return of $563.99M.\n\nIt is worth noting that Solana has been on an extended bullish run, as the Solana token has gained over 19% in price value within the last 30 days. These positive stats could add to the reasons ChatGPT is listing Solana as a must-have token.\n\nPolkadot (DOT) Rallies As Imminent Surge Expected\n\nPolkadot (DOT) has had a significant rally in price in the last 24 hours, which may suggest a boost in price within the coming days. Polkadot gained 1.3% in value within the last day to trade at $5.08 currently. The token has also had a trading volume of over 100M within that same time frame.\n\nThis recent rally of Polkadot is coming at the back of an extended downward slip in price value. This is evident in the 7 days stats, which show a 1.7% loss in value for DOT.\n\nAlso, Polkadot lost 2.0% in the last 14 days. However, analysts expect that the recent upturn in price will be the beginning of an extended surge in price value. With ChatGPT listing Polkadot as a coin worth investing in, we anticipate the coin entering a bull run soon.\n\nMoon-Bound Pomerdoge (POMD) Gears at Becoming the King of Memecoins\n\nPomerdoge is making its presence known in the crypto industry as the project receives massive attention in its first presale phase. Pomerdoge is a new P2E gaming platform that connects players around the globe while serving as a platform of digital networking and friendly competition.\n\nAs the Pomerdoge presale heats up, a collection of 7,777 NFTs will be minted and made available only to presale investors of the POMD token. Another benefit that presale buyers will enjoy is a share of the revenue generated from the Pomerdoge platform while positioning themselves for explosive ROI.\n\nYou can also become a presale investor when you buy the Pomerdoge token at the price of only $0.007.The Pomerdoge project has been audited by SolidProof and Cyberscope and will have its liquidity locked for life to prevent a threat to investors' portfolios.\n\nIt is important to invest early in the Pomerdoge project as early investors stand more chance of making significant gains.\n\nFind out more about the Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Today\n\nDisclaimer: This article is a paid publication and does not have journalistic/ editorial involvement of Hindustan Times.

        "title": "The World of Black Cosplay is Leaving Out Fat People - Okayplayer",
        "content": "Surrounded by a wall with clippings and fanart of the beloved Japanese manga Naruto, Lady Hoekage (yes, her name is a play on Naruto\u2019s Tsunade, better known as \u201cLady Hokage\u201d) is dressed as one of the series\u2019 most iconic characters \u2014 Kakashi. Wearing a green and blue sensei ensemble paired with gray hair, a Konoha headband, and a kunai knife, the content creator and entrepreneur embodies the effortless cool of the shinobi. Like many other people across the world, Hoekage is particularly intrigued by and immersed in the world of cosplay, or the art of dressing up as various characters from shows, cartoons, anime, and other fandoms. She has always been a fan of anime and had a great interest in using it as inspiration for her craft, which ultimately led her to explore cosplaying as another form of content creation. However, she initially had some apprehension about publicly participating in the activity due to her size.\n\n\u201c[Before now], cosplay was always something I wanted to do, but I always thought, \u2018I'll do it when I tone up, or I'll do it when I lose some weight. Or, you know, when my skin gets clear,\u2019 she said during a Zoom call. \u201cI finally came to a realization in 2020, and I told myself, \u2018Bitch, you're not waiting to do any of these things. You're just afraid of being talked about or people pointing these things out.\u2019 I really had to tell myself, \u2018Girl, get over it.\u2019\u201d\n\nLady Hoekage\u2019s concerns don\u2019t exist in a vacuum. They stem from the deeply rooted social ill of fatphobia \u2014 the covert and overt oppression of fat people \u2014 and it greatly impedes on the success of fat cosplayers in a multitude of ways. Desirability politics, lack of proper and accessible clothing and sizing, the constant exposure to fat shaming, fat fetishism, and inappropriate parasocial behaviors not only negatively impact their safety, but make it a challenge to participate in something they really want to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already hard being noticed as a larger-bodied content creator in general, but I\u2019m also Black, so that\u2019s two strikes against me already which [keeps me from being pushed in front of a larger audience],\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is the point of doing this all if I\u2019m not being seen?\u201d\n\nContent creator Lady Hoekage dressed in anime cosplay as Naruto\u2019s Kakashi. Image courtesy of Lady Hoekage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe depictions of fat characters in pop culture\n\n\n\nFatphobia\u2019s sphere of influence traces back beyond the digital age and to the time of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, where Black fat bodies were postured as lesser than in comparison to white ones in order to perpetuate and justify their enslavement. As a result, fatness and Blackness have been \u2014 and still are \u2014 seen as unworthy and unrealistic beauty standards equated to ugliness. Coupled with anti-blackness (or the systemic oppression of Black people), we are now seeing how fatphobia intentionally creates barriers for cosplayers who share these identities.\n\nThe depictions of fat characters in anime, cartoons, and other fandoms are minimal in both number and range. When they are present, their storylines are usually crafted and coded as villains, comic relief, supportive best friends, weight loss totems, or a combination of the aforementioned tropes. From Spiderman\u2019s best friend Ned, who\u2019s the film\u2019s stereotypical POC and fat best friend, to the Star Wars franchise\u2019s Jabba the Hutt, an infamous galactic gangster who serves as a representation of greed. There\u2019s even Usopp from One Piece, who gained weight from eating during the plot\u2019s time skip, and loses it in order to level up. Despite being iconic, these characters \u2014 and moreover their fat bodies \u2014 are presented as an amalgamation of poor choices that should be punished by ridicule, subjugation, and being negatively regarded, which is directly connected to how everyday fat people are being viewed and treated.\n\nSolana Dreams, a content creator whose cosplay niche mostly involves portraying fantasy characters, pointed out how fatphobia not only plays a critical role in how fat, Black cosplayers navigate their experience, but also limits the characters they\u2019re able to portray as well.\n\n\u201cAs a cosplayer, it\u2019s all about your ability to wear something and to either look like a specific character or as close to them as possible,\u201d Solana said. \u201cI feel like more scrutiny is on us as fat Black cosplayers because we\u2019re not canon.\u201d\n\nContent creator Solana Dreams often portrays fantasy characters in their cosplay. Image courtesy of Solana Dreams.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding fat tax and lack of clothing accessibility\n\nFatphobic propaganda is stitched in the fabric of the quotidian, including the very fiber of the clothes on our backs. With women\u2019s plus size (U.S. sizes 18 and up) clothing only occupying 19 percent of the fashion industry, there\u2019s a large gap of resources and clothing accessibility between those who wear straight sizes, and those who wear above a size 18. Because of this, fat cosplayers have to find innovative and creative ways to approach their craft. For Solana Dreams, they often have to make their own pieces.\n\n\u201cAs a person who wears a size 4x-5x, I can\u2019t always buy something off the internet because it\u2019s very hard to find clothing. I usually have to make my own stuff. It makes the cosplaying process even longer because I have to put things together and find or create pieces that fit my body,\u201d they said during a Zoom call. \u201cI feel so bad because I want to produce as quickly as some of my cosplaying counterparts, but that\u2019s not my reality.\u201d\n\nIn the rare instances that actual cosplay attire is available in larger sizes, there are still some alterations that need to be made. Lady Hoekage shared how she ordered a bodysuit from Amazon for a Mirko cosplay that sort of fit her, but she had to cut the belt and add an elastic band in order to dress up as the fan-favorite My Hero Academia character.\n\nThe issue with size-inclusive clothing doesn\u2019t stop at size. Price is also a limiting factor in making cosplay more accessible to those in fat bodies due to the Fat Tax, which makes plus-size clothing more expensive than straight-size options. The insidiousness of things like cost and clothing inaccessibility make it harder for cosplay enthusiasts to consistently participate in the activity. On the other hand, some clothing, despite being marketed as \u201cplus size and inexpensive,\u201d fit poorly due to being constructed in different countries where sizing is not equivalent to that of the U.S. All of these limitations can deter someone from cosplaying more than they\u2019d like to.\n\nLauryn Craine, a Public Services Assistant who has a deep love of anime and cosplay, recalled how her friends recommended Aliexpress to her in high school, because that\u2019s where they bought all their cosplay stuff while being on a budget. After checking the differences between Asian and American sizing, she decided on a Love Live! (a Japanese multimedia franchise encompassing anime TV series, manga, and video games) outfit in a size 3x.\n\n\u201cThe skirt fit fine but the top was absolutely too small. I then triple-checked all the measurements and realized that it was actually equivalent to a size larger or XL,\u201d Craine said. \u201cAfter that, I never cosplayed again because it felt like nothing would fit, and I didn\u2019t want to go through the trouble of feeling like that again.\u201d\n\nGrad student and educator TC Monreaux in Velma cosplay. mage courtesy of TC Monreaux.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerceptions of fat, Black cosplayers and their representation online and IRL\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s even more ostracizing about the fat, Black cosplayer experience is the fact that fatphobia leads to skewed perceptions of this community, and their ability to be recognized and taken seriously as cosplayers. Grad student and educator TC Monreaux, whose foray into cosplay began while as an undergraduate student, shared how many people did not recognize their Velma cosplay, despite being dressed in the Scooby-Doo character\u2019s easily recognizable colors.\n\n\u201cPeople seem to have a hard time identifying a character on a fat body. Although I didn\u2019t go full-fledged feminine with the skirt and a kitten heel, I still had on glasses, an orange top, and burgundy bottoms. I had to say \u2018Jinkies\u2019 in order for people to get it, and they still told me that wasn\u2019t what they got from my cosplay,\u201d Monreaux said.\n\nNegative public attitudes toward the intersections of fatness and Blackness also manifest on digital platforms, where algorithms heavily censor those in larger and darker bodies while prioritizing those who are smaller, lighter, or are closer to whiteness and benefit from desirability.\n\nGenerally, Black people, regardless of their other intersections, are not featured on platforms that cater to white and non-Black audiences. But what\u2019s even worse is that Black-run platforms also perpetuate desirability politics, often excluding fat, Black people from their feeds.\n\nAs highlighted in a tweet by Lady Hoekage, there\u2019s an unspoken expectation of fat, Black cosplayers to be exceptional and often hypersexualized, in order to be pushed by the algorithm and receive public recognition.\n\n\u201cThe main issue is that I follow a bunch of different creators but I never see them. If people are seeing their favorite creators, they need to be sharing us to their stories, double-tapping, etc. It\u2019s not that hard. It\u2019s about us getting out there, and there\u2019s only so much we can do on our own,\u201d she said.\n\nThe fat, Black cosplay community being rendered invisible is even more recognizable during convention season. Monreaux has noticed that there\u2019s a stark difference between seeing fat, Black folk at conventions, and what is actually being shown in photos, videos, and other forms of event coverage.\n\n\u201cI went to Coco Con in Atlanta where Black cosplayers came together, and I saw a lot who were also fat there as well. However, I didn\u2019t really see many of them in the videos that I ended up seeing,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s alway intentional, but I do think that there can be a more intentional effort to make sure that everyone \u2014 including fat, Black folk \u2014 who show up to these events receive attention.\u201d\n\nSpecial education teacher and content creator Sailor Xtasy.

Because of a lack of inclusion in fashion, Lady Hoekage started DokiDoki Threads, an exclusively plus-size anime wear company that also caters to cosplayer needs. All of her pieces, which range from sizes 1x-5x, are designed to be used as both regular clothing and cosplay items.\n\nThere\u2019s also those who hope to bring more awareness to this issue simply by participating in it, and encouraging other potential plus-size cosplayers to do the same.\n\n\u201cAs a plus sized cosplayer, I hope to uplift the community by showing how you can still be beautiful and plus-size,\u201d special education teacher and content creator Sailor Xtasy said. \u201cI wear the same popular cosplays as everyone else and still look amazing. I want people to know that cosplaying is about having fun and the joy it brings oneself. I will proudly show off my curves and rolls if it means that I'm happy.\u201d\n\nBut in order for things to truly change, there must be safe spaces made for fat, Black content creators.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s helpful and encouraging is having interconnectivity among fat, Black cosplayers, and those who are in more privileged bodies need to check their biases when it comes to those of us in marginalized bodies,\u201d Solana Dreams said. \u201cMore spaces that include us need to be created so that we can find harmony and compassion with each other.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nCheyenne M.
