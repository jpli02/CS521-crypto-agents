Following which ,if the coin price starts moving up again these MAs can be seen acting as a strong demand zone.\n\nAt present, the coin price is trading at the lower band of the bollinger band indicator. This comes after the coin price saw a strong bearish pressure from the upper band of the bollinger band indicator.
