        "content": "Dymension Announces \u201cGenesis Rolldrop,\u201d Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos Users Can Claim DYM Tokens\n\nDymension, a layer-1 blockchain built on Cosmos, has announced a \"genesis rolldrop\" of its DYM token to more than a million crypto users across various chains and projects. The airdrop is open to users who meet certain criteria, with approximately 70 million DYM tokens (7% of the supply) being offered.\n\nDymension is a network for deploying app chains called \"RollApps,\" and it enables connections across various rollup scaling networks. The network uses Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) addresses and allows RollApp creators to choose which virtual machine and token to use, and can publish data to external chains like Celestia or Avail.\n\nEligible users for the airdrop include those who staked the TIA token in Celestia, users of Ethereum layer-2 networks Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and the upcoming Blast, and users of the Cosmos Hub, Stride, and Osmosis decentralized exchange (DEX). Additionally, more than 500,000 Solana users are eligible for the airdrop, including addresses that have used protocols like cross-chain bridge Wormhole, leading NFT marketplace Tensor, and NFT distribution platform Drip.Haus. Owners of certain NFTs, including Pudgy Penguins, Mad Lads, Tensorians, and Bad Kids, can also claim an allotment of DYM tokens.\n\nFollowing the genesis airdrop, Dymension has proposed allocating a further 2.5 million DYM to users who bridge funds to the chain from other networks, with eligible tokens including USDC, TIA, USDT, ATOM, ETH, and SOL.\n\nDymension's airdrop is part of a growing trend of networks and projects distributing their tokens to users. Recent high-profile airdrops include those from Jito, Celestia and Pyth Network.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."
