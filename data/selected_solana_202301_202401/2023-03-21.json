        "content": "On Monday, The Render Network Foundation proposed a plan to build its new burn-and-mint equilibrium (BME) model on the Solana blockchain by investing its resources.\n\nThe Foundation released a primer on RNP-002 today.\n\n\n\nThe post details RNP-002: Layer 1 Network Expansion.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with RNP-000 there is up to a 21 day community feedback period that begins today! We would love your feedback. https://t.co/90j0gmhCOw \u2014 The Render Network (@rendernetwork) March 20, 2023\n\nThe foundation proposed a plan to implement a burn-and-mint equilibrium (BME) model last month, which was passed by the community through voting. The model requires users to burn a predetermined amount of their RNDR tokens which will swap for non-fungible work credits which are distributed to node operators.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the Solana ecosystem is perfectly suitable for the Render Network\u2019s BME model. Solana Network provides real-time and on-chain data while enhancing transaction times, and reducing the cost of transactions.\n\nAs Render Network uses Rust programming for better performance, while Solana virtual machines can compile to form a smart contract.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Issues a Plan to Improve Its Network Upgrades\n\nFounder Jules Urbach stated in the announcement, \u201cSolana has the right mix of speed without compromising security (vs side-chain approaches). I think if nothing else we need to ensure we get fast speed, but never at the expense of security in the long run. I didn\u2019t take the decision lightly to even consider it. It\u2019s been much of this year getting into the pros and cons.\u201d\n\nThe 21-day period is decided to get a response from the community, starting from March 20."

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst known for calling the 2018 Bitcoin (BTC) bottom thinks Ethereum (ETH) is primed for a breakout.\n\nPseudonymous trader Smart Contracter shares a chart with his 221,700 Twitter followers that suggests Ethereum could shoot up past the $1,900 range in short order.\n\n\u201cI believe there\u2019s a strong chance low of the week is in on ETH, as it ran the highs and lows on hourly and pulled back after weekly close with no upside wick, plus structure looks like an ABC [wave].\u201d\n\nSmart Contracter is a popular practitioner of the Elliott Wave theory, an advanced technical analysis approach that attempts to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset tends to resume its uptrend after going through an ABC corrective move.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,736 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down 2.9% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSmart Contracter also thinks Bitcoin\u2019s recent price rally could mean a couple of different things, though he thinks they\u2019re all bullish for the top crypto asset.\n\n\u201cBTC rallying into all this mayhem and having a monster weekly breakout is telling us one of two things, but too early to tell which one yet.\n\n#1. It\u2019s telling us that BTC is still a risk on asset and is simply moving before equities, like it always does and equities play catch up soon\n\n#2. It\u2019s telling us that its finally decoupled from trad finance and is now a safe haven asset doing what it was originally intended to do.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $27,812 at time of writing and is down 0.19% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSmart Contracter also thinks Ethereum competitor Solana (SOL) could rally against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC) after taking out its diagonal resistance on the hourly chart.\n\n\u201cNice SOL/BTC breakout brewing on the back of a beautiful SOL/USD weekly close.\u201d\n\nSOL is worth $22.47 at time of writing. The 11th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up 1.33% in the past 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Orca becomes the latest decentralized exchange (DEX) to restrict U.S. residents from interacting with its web platform, according to a notice on its official website.\n\nThe Solana-based DEX noted that the U.S. would be joining the list of banned countries by March 31, giving affected users over a week to prepare for the changes. Orca\u2019s announcement appears to be linked to a rising regulatory crackdown on the digital currency industry in the United States.\n\n\u201cOrca will be adding the United States to the regions and countries which are restricted from trading on orca.so effective March 31, 2023. This will not impact the ability of U.S. users to directly interact with Orca\u2019s smart contracts or SDK, nor will it impact their ability to provide liquidity through orca.so,\u201d the announcement read.\n\nOrca was launched in February 2021, and immediately became one of the most popular Solana DEXs and automated market maker (AMM) platforms. In February alone, Orca recorded transaction volumes exceeding $600 million, with nearly $50 million on total volume locked (TVL) on the Solana network.\n\nIt appears that U.S. users will still be allowed to interact with Orca\u2019s smart contracts if they do so directly. Only the website functionalities will be blocked for U.S. residents, with a range of options available for U.S. residents to interact directly with the DEX.\n\nOne method that U.S. users have been doing to bypass the restriction is by using tools like Truffle or Hardhat, or the Jupiter platform. Another alternative to interact directly with Orca\u2019s smart contract has been via the use of virtual private networks (VPN) to hide their IP address, allowing them to evade geographical restrictions.\n\nOther DEXs have moved to preclude U.S. residents from using their platforms, citing regulatory concerns with Binance DEX leading the way in 2019, but offering users the option of VPNs to bypass restrictions. DEX aggregator joined the growing list with a ban on U.S. residents with a strict warning for citizens not to attempt bypassing restrictions.\n\n\u201cYou must not use any software or networking techniques, including the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to modify your internet protocol address or otherwise circumvent or attempt to circumvent this prohibition,\u201d the warning read.\n\nA case against DEXs\n\nGenerally, decentralized exchanges are typically not subject to registration by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) because of the absence of custody or order books. However, some experts believe that registration for DEXs with the Commission is required as they satisfy the requirements for registration with the Commission.\n\n\u201cThe focus is not on the label you put on something or the technology you\u2019re using. The focus is on the function, and what the platform is doing. Whether it\u2019s decentralized or not, whether it\u2019s on a smart contract or not, what matters is it\u2019s an exchange,\u201d Robert Cohen, former head of the SEC Cyber Unit, said in 2018.\n\nWatch: Law & Order Regulatory Compliance for Blockchain & Digital Assets\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Teacher of the Year co-created Encinitas district's social emotional learning curriculum - Del Mar Times",
        "content": "Solana Beach resident Kelly Griffin was recently named the Teacher of the Year at Mission Estancia School in Carlsbad. Griffin, also known as \u201cMiss G\u201d, was honored for her work as the co-creator of the Encinitas Union School District\u2019s social and emotional learning program TRAC, which stands for Teamwork, Regulation, Awareness and Community.\n\nGriffin was teaching fourth grade when a team of teachers came in with flowers, a crown, sash and a sign that said \u201cTeacher of the Year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis honor validates all of the hard work I have put into this work, this school and highlights the importance of making SEL a priority in our schools,\u201d said Griffin. \u201cThis program was once a 29-hour a week position, not a program at all and now it is required curriculum for all nine schools, educating more than 5,000 students and hundreds of staff every year. When you step back and look, it\u2019s quite an accomplishment.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving her masters in elementary education from Rockhurst University in Kansas City, Griffin moved out to California where she became a presenter for Sandy Hook Promise. She was a teacher at Del Mar Pines School in Carmel Valley when Encinitas Union posted a job opening for a pilot SEL program.\n\nGriffin was hired in 2018 and along with Park Dale Lane teacher Sarah Wood, they built the framework for TRAC. The purpose of TRAC is to build positive relationships and an atmosphere where each student and adult feels connected, cared about and physically and emotionally safe. By year three of their pilot program, the district adopted TRAC, hired seven teachers and got it into all nine schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to build it from the ground up,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nGriffin reaches every student at Mission Estancia, from kindergarten to sixth grade students,\u201cfrom the little guys to the super independent thinkers\u201d. She knows the name of every kid on campus.\n\nSEL is taught 45 minutes a week for each class and the teachers stay in the room and are part of the conversation. With her infectiously sparkling and sunny personality, her lessons focus on the core competencies of self awareness, self management, responsible decision making, social awareness and relationship skills: \u201cThe key is connection and belonging,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nStudents do activities like weekly reflections on their \u201crose, thorn, bud\u201d: a highlight (rose), a challenge (thorn) and a new idea or something they are looking forward to knowing or understanding more (bud).\n\nThey do appreciation and apologies circles, where Griffin is always blown away by the things students share and how they speak about what\u2019s on their heart: \u201cThese kids have so much to say but as you get older, we learn to put it away.\u201d\n\nAt Mission Estancia, Miss G has created a vibrant and engaging learning environment for her students and a culture of kindness and belonging. Students have built affirmation stations, sharing what they need to hear on a hard day: \u201cI am brave\u201d, \u201cI am grateful\u201d, \u201cNo stinky thinky.\u201d\n\nIn one activity this year she assigned kids another younger student to greet every day at school\u2014having a friendly interaction at the door is just one of many actions to take that helps students in a school community feel a stronger sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cThe kids got super creative,\u201d Griffin said, noting one student brought in a giant hand and a mini hand for high fives, some handed out fortune cookies and compliment cards, and a couple of kids dressed up as bees one day as a way to \u201cBee Kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything bring such change on campus\u2026and it was just about starting the day with connection,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite activity I\u2019ve done. To stop and have a moment with your peers has a huge ripple effect.\u201d\n\nBeyond her work with TRAC, Griffin has also spearheaded all-school events such as assemblies, author connections, family nights, philanthropy projects and campus murals.\n\n\u201cI love big projects, it gives kids power,\u201d she said.\n\nRecently she led a student design challenge for the six new benches built by parent volunteers. During Kindness Week, 125 students turned in bench designs and then the students help paint the winning designs. One design was called the \u201cconnection collection\u201d with questions painted on the bench to encourage a conversation with someone new, another bench features a cloudscape and sun that sweetly reads: \u201cYou were born to shine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no amount of math or reading to science that can prepare our students to enter the world ready to face the challenges of the 21st century,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nShe said back when most of us were growing up, bullying stopped at 3 p.m. but now it\u2019s on their phones and students are faced with a social media rich culture in which they are bombarded with negative influences all around them. She said you only need to look at troubling news headlines to be reminded what a lack of empathy can produce.\n\n\u201cSocial and emotional learning shines a light on what really matters,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWho we are as people and how we treat others.\u201d\n\nGriffin loves being a light for her students, she absolutely loves her job and it shows. Drawing on one of her favorite quotes from author L.R. Knost, her job is not to toughen up students to face a cruel and heartless world but to help raise children who will make the world a little less cruel and heartless.\n\n"
