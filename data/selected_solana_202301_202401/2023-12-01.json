        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nBrian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, talked about rumors of a Base token for the exchange\u2019s L2 network with Decrypt. Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, had previously said something different. But, Armstrong stated that there are no plans to create a token for Base.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the company wants Base to be an industry initiative, not a just Coinbase asset. Armstrong emphasized the need for interoperability with the broader crypto landscape. He also underscored Coinbase\u2019s support to create and maintain stability and trust within the industry.\n\nCoinbase aims to make transactions on its platform fast and cheap. Achieving this objective involves refining Base and making their layer 2 the default on ecosystem.\n\nArmstrong acknowledged that 7% of transactions on Coinbase use layer-2 solutions, including Base, with the company committed to increasing this percentage in the future. This includes integrating into other blockchain ecosystems such as Solana to enable fast and cost-effective transactions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s things like integrating the Lightning Network on Bitcoin, it\u2019s integrating other layer-1s that are very fast, like Solana, 2e need to get it where probably 99% of transactions are happening on layer-2 to get those performance goals of under one cent and one second,\u201d said Armstrong."

Go to Alpha Reports\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) aggregator Jupiter commenced its much-anticipated airdrop on Friday\u2014and revealed to users how many of the 4 billion total JUP tokens up for grabs that they can expect to receive.\n\nA portal on Jupiter\u2019s website is now live for the platform\u2019s users to connect their wallets and check how much JUP they reaped. It's not yet clear when the actual claim process will begin.\n\nAll Jupiter users will receive 200 JUP regardless of their trading history, according to the company. Those \u201cOGs\u201d who held at least $10 on the platform or made at least 10 transactions prior to March 2022 will receive an additional 500 JUP. From there, the bulk of a user\u2019s JUP allocation was determined by factors including their trading volume on Jupiter and the consistency of their use of the site.\n\nJupiter users and Solana enthusiasts were quick to celebrate news of the airdrop\u2019s launch, with some Twitter users reporting substantial JUP hauls above 100,000. How much that is actually worth, however, will remain unknown until the token actually drops and starts trading.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOthers saw the airdrop\u2014which nearly a million SOL wallets are reportedly eligible to claim\u2014as the latest sign of Solana\u2019s rising fortunes, off the blockchain\u2019s resounding rebound since October.\n\nJupiter is one of the largest DeFi projects built on Solana.

        "content": "Fri 01 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nAs Solana, the \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d is reborn after a tumultuous period, its spectacular progress against its historic rival reignites the debate: are we witnessing the beginnings of a paradigm shift in the crypto universe?\n\nSolana, the crypto tsunami sweeping towards Ethereum\n\nSolana (SOL) has recorded gains surpassing other major cryptocurrencies with a price increase of 7% on Wednesday morning. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $60.16 each, representing a 24-hour rise of more than 7% (CoinGecko). Over 7 days, SOL has gained 10%.\n\nThis trend shows a resurgence for the Solana outsider. After a challenging year in 2022, marked by repeated outages and the FTX affair, the decentralized network seems to be attracting investors once again.\n\nSOL has had a phenomenal rally in November. The price of Ethereum\u2019s competitor surpassed $50 for the first time since May 2022, outperforming most cryptos in terms of performance. According to experts, this surge is due to a squeeze caused by the exit of short sellers and renewed institutional interest.\n\nHowever, a month later, Solana continues to rise. In the last 30 days, SOL has increased by more than 70%. Otherwise, the crypto market is relatively stagnant. Bitcoin and Ethereum have barely moved over 24 hours. The same goes for Dogecoin, Tron, and XRP. Only Avalanche (AVAX) is performing as well as SOL over 24 hours, at $20.87 (+80% in a month).\n\nRaoul Pal compares Ethereum and Solana\n\nThe famous crypto trader and investor, Raoul Pal, has recently provided a unique perspective on the comparison between Ethereum and Solana. He notes that the use of Solana is distinguished by a smoother, faster, and more user-friendly experience.\n\nRenowned for his sharp analyses based on the blockchain, his comments comparing the two networks on purely fundamental grounds are exceptional. In his detailed study, he likens Ethereum to Android, praising the vastness of its decentralized ecosystem, while Solana resembles Apple in its focus on user comfort.\n\nHis words summarize his opinion well: \u201cOnce in the Solana ecosystem, everything seems ultra-fast, smooth, engaging, and easy for the user. The best analogy is that SOL is Apple where ETH is Android. Both are winners. Huge.\u201d\n\nIn this novel analysis, Raoul Pal highlights Solana\u2019s ability to compete with Ethereum, and that\u2019s on almost all fronts. He especially praises the excellence of its Phantom wallet, highly prized by SOL holders.\n\nThe skeptical view: Ethereum remains the undisputed leader\n\nAlthough Solana wins on certain points, it is still far from rivalling Ethereum. Indeed, while it impresses with its technical performance, it cannot yet equal the richness of the Ethereum ecosystem nor its dominance in the dApp sector.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum also boasts a crucial advantage: its credibility and reputation solidly established over the years in the crypto industry. Therefore, despite high fees and scalability limitations, it remains the reference point for institutional players.\n\nWill Solana ever manage to dethrone Ethereum? If it continues on its current trajectory, it\u2019s not impossible. However, the path is still long for this contender to the throne, which must above all consolidate investors\u2019 trust in the long term.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Why Solana might outshine Ethereum in 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market anticipates a potential bull market, investors may consider accumulating altcoins in preparation for it.\n\nA notable trend has emerged where altcoins are gaining significant strength, as evidenced by their recent breach of the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) barrier, signaling a more positive investor sentiment toward them.\n\nChart of Altcoins crossing the 50-week SMA barrier. Source CryptoCon\n\nIn the next phase of the market expansion, Solana (SOL) is expected to reach 10% of Ethereum (ETH), according to InvestAnswers, a prominent crypto analyst.\n\nAssuming Ethereum tops $8,000 in the next bull market, the analyst speculates that if Solana reaches 10% of ETH\u2019s market cap, a threshold it has already reached in the past, that would mean a $231 price target for SOL, resulting in a return on investment (ROI) of approximately 278% from the current price of $61.02.\n\nA few days ago, Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem reached a significant milestone, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) hitting a new yearly peak of over $655 million. This marks a substantial increase of 211% since the $210.47 million TVL recorded on January 1.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Solana boasts a remarkable transaction speed of tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS), far surpassing Ethereum\u2019s 15 TPS. This makes Solana a favorable choice for applications demanding high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.\n\nSOL reaching a new market cap\n\nIn a more optimistic scenario, InvestAnswers suggests that Solana reaching 20% of Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization is not entirely implausible.\n\n\n\nIf Solana were to achieve this milestone, it would translate to a market capitalization of around $192 billion, according to the expert.\n\nConsidering the potential market cap of $192 billion and token quantities, this would translate into a price of $453 for 1 SOL, resulting in a ROI of around 2,038% from the current price of $61.02.\n\nHypothetical price of SOL. Source: Finbold\n\nInvestAnswers highlights that Solana has already exceeded the 10% threshold in the past.\n\nThe analyst presented a chart depicting SOL\u2019s upside potential, where the yellow line represents 10% of ETH\u2019s market cap, and the blue line represents Solana\u2019s price crossing this threshold in October 2021.\n\nMarket caps of SOL and ETH. Source: InvestAnswers\n\nCathie Wood praises Solana\u2019s speed and efficiency\n\nSolana reached a new year-to-day (YTD) high a day after ARK Invest (NYSEARCA: ARKK) CEO Cathie Wood extolled the network for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nSOL one-month price performance. Source: Finbold\n\nDuring a CNBC interview on November 15, Wood characterized the Solana network as a significant infrastructure player within the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nShe expressed satisfaction with its performance in recent market conditions, stating that Solana has been doing a \u201creally good job.\u201d Drawing a parallel to the historical comparison between Bitcoin and Ethereum, she said:\n\n\u201cEther was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day \u2014 that\u2019s how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and cost-effective than Ether,\u201d Wood said\n\nWood praised Solana for its speed and efficiency compared to the Ethereum network, but predicting the project\u2019s potential remains challenging. Solana is a nascent project, and various factors come into play when determining its future price.\n\nFundamentals: SOL vs ETH\n\nSolana\u2019s innovative proof of history (PoH) consensus mechanism utilizes a verifiable record of past events to achieve network-wide consensus. This approach enables it to complete tens of thousands of transactions per second at a remarkably low fee, making the ecosystem ideal for applications demanding high throughput.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), known as \u2018The Ethereum Merge,\u2019 marked a significant step in the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nThe Merge has brought down Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by 99.95%, addressing one of the longest-standing issues with PoW-based blockchain systems, but it didn\u2019t address the issues of only 15 TPS and high costs on the network.\n\nSolana Labs Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko believes the Merge has minimal impact on improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability based on the number of transactions and users, he said during an interview with Bloomberg Technology on September 21.\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Merge doesn\u2019t really improve the scalability of the network. When you look at the number of transactions that Solana (SOL) handles from applications and from users on a daily basis, that\u2019s more than not just Ethereum but all Ethereum-based blockchains combined. So I think Ethereum has a long way to go on scalability,\u201d Yakovenko said\n\nTo address the issues of scalability, Ethereum is going to implement sharding and zk rollups. This approach will significantly reduce the load on the main chain, enabling faster transaction processing and lower fees, but it\u2019s years away, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nSome are concert about the Solana ecosystem and question its long-term sustainability and resilience, and while the developer community is growing, it is still far behind Ethereum\u2019s well-established ecosystem of developers and projects.\n\nSolana holds an advantage over Ethereum in terms of transaction speed and scalability, making it an attractive choice for projects with high throughput demands. While Ethereum is working on addressing these limitations, it may take several years to achieve the same level of performance as Solana. This paraphrase might be the main reason SOL will outperform ETH in the next bull market, but the project\u2019s long-term success hinges on its ability to grow and address network stability issues.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
