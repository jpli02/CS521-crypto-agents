        "content": "NFT Marketplace Magic Eden Launches Multi-Chain Wallet\n\nNFT marketplace Magic Eden announced the launch of its multi-chain wallet, which supports Solana, Bitcoin, Polygon, and Ethereum. Magic Eden's multi-chain wallet is designed to offer a seamless and intuitive experience for users to manage their NFT portfolios across multiple blockchains. It features instant cross-chain swaps, NFT portfolio management, and the ability to trade NFTs directly from the wallet.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with Exodus, the wallet is self-custodial, allowing users to retain complete control over their crypto assets. This is a critical feature for users who prioritize the security and privacy of their digital assets.\n\nTo incentivize early adopters, Magic Eden is offering limited-time in-wallet mints of popular NFT projects such as Claynosaurz, Degenerate Ape Academy, and BoDoggos throughout February. Additionally, users can participate in airdrops and other perks by using the wallet.\n\nProduct Market Lead, therealmiso, said in the official announcement post: \u201cAs the team made great strides in the NFT & Ordinals space, it became clear there was a missing complementary piece critical to convenience: a singular wallet that allows users to seamlessly manage and collect NFTs across major chains.\u201d\n\nMagic Eden's expansion into a multi-chain platform is a strategic move to cater to the growing demand for NFTs across different blockchains. The company initially focused on the Solana network, but has since expanded its support to include Polygon, Bitcoin, and Ethereum."

        "content": "Jupiter, a Solana-based liquidity aggregator and decentralized exchange (DEX), has witnessed a significant increase in trading volumes, as the platform prepares for the issuance of its native token, JUP.\n\nThe increase in volume suggests that traders are positioning themselves to benefit from the Jan. 31 JUP airdrop. An airdrop is a method commonly used in the cryptocurrency space to distribute tokens to users, often to encourage adoption and usage of a new platform or currency.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem competes with other blockchains like Ethereum for dominance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL), or the amount of crypto assets deposited in DeFi platforms, stood at US$1.40 billion at the time of writing, making it the fifth-largest DeFi chain in the world, according to DeFiLlama data. Ethereum hosts the world\u2019s largest DeFi ecosystem with US$31.4 billion in TVL.\n\nTrading activity on Jupiter has been comparable to that seen on established platforms like Ethereum-based Uniswap, currently ranked as the world\u2019s largest DEX with US$4.1 billion in TVL.\n\nSolana is also the world\u2019s second-most active blockchain for NFTs, with US$4.8 billion in all-time sales behind Ethereum\u2019s US$42.4 billion.\n\nIn December, Solana\u2019s US$365.48 million barely edged Ethereum\u2019s NFT sales volume of US$363.45 million.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token SOL is the world\u2019s fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization with US$43.8 billion. SOL traded at US$100 at the time of writing, up 15.5% over the past seven days, according to CoinGecko data."

        "title": "Unibot Boosts Token Value With Solana Ecosystem Draw - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Trading application Unibot will issue a native Solana ecosystem token that accrues value back to holders of the original Ethereum-based UNIBOT tokens, a move that initially met with criticism and caused volatile price action last week.\n\nUnibot expanded to the Solana ecosystem in late December but said last week it would introduce a UNISOL token that accrued revenue in the form of Solana\u2019s SOL tokens. The decision created concerns among long-time UNIBOT holders, who feared dilution as traders would be inclined to choose the newer token in favor of the older one. A sell-off ensued.\n\nBut developers said early Monday that UNISOL could ultimately boost UNIBOT\u2019s value accrual, helping ease some losses from the past few days as traders priced in new information. The Unibot platform connects user wallets to the decentralized exchange Uniswap and lets them punt on tokens just as easily as they would send messages to each other on the popular messaging app by using the messaging application Telegram or a terminal.\n\nUNIBOT slid from over $100 to as low as $48. (DEXTools)\n\n\u201cThe revenue sharing for protocol revenue generated by @UnibotOnSolana is split 50/50 between two pools,\u201d developers posted on X. \u201cPool #1: simply being a holder of $UNIBOT on Ethereum, no strings attached. You'll link your Ethereum address, which holds $UNIBOT to a Solana address that receives revenue in the form of SOL. Pool #2: holders of $UNISOL on Solana.\u201d\n\nUNIBOT holders are set to receive some 80% of the supply of UNISOL through a snapshot and claim mechanism. Since its early January launch, over 20,000 users have generated more than $130m in total volume, developers claimed Monday.\n\n//ANNOUNCEMENT\n\n\n\nWe'd like to clear the confusion around the path forward.\n\n\n\nThe revenue sharing for protocol revenue generated by @UnibotOnSolana is split 50/50 between two pools, described as follows.\n\nPool #1: simply being a holder of $UNIBOT on Ethereum, no strings attached.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/vqEVVhG1FI \u2014 Unibot (@TeamUnibot) January 28, 2024\n\nOn-chain data shows Unibot has garnered 11,700 ether (ETH) in fees since the platform went live in May, paying out a portion of this straight to token holders. Users have also steadily increased, reaching 41,000 on Monday compared to just over 2,000 at the end of last June.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Sunday alone, the platform generated $74,000 in fees across Solana and Ethereum on $7.5 million in combined volumes.\n\n(Dune)\n\nPer Dune Analytics, Unibot's average daily volumes are just above $5.5 million, a long way from the $900 million daily on the market-leading DEX Uniswap.\n\nUNIBOT prices are up 21% in the past 24 hours, DEXTools data shows."

        "content": "SINGAPORE / ACCESSWIRE / January 29, 2024 / MixMob , a Solana-powered gaming universe based on Remix Culture, has announced that its native governance token $MXM will be listed on multiple crypto exchange platforms on February 1. The launch is the culmination of MixMob's Flip Web 2 campaign that began in mid-November, and coincides with an official trailer and website launch for chapter 6 of the MixMob game economy.\n\nIn a world where a malevolent master AI has destroyed human culture, MixMob players are tasked with joining a creative resistance movement in order to \"re-chain\" humanity's culture. Unlike with many play-to-earn games, MixMob is a player-owned game world that's designed to reward players for their creativity and style as much as their gaming skills.\n\nThe token launch comes in the wake of a successful MixBots sale, which saw 9,000 NFTs sold out within just 12 minutes, with total proceeds in excess of $2.25 million. The success is striking, similar to selling out 9,000 pairs of premium Air Jordan's in just 12 minutes. Strong demand for MixMob's MixBots was due in part to the support of high-profile Solana communities including BONK!, Mad Lads and Neo Tokyo.\n\nThe MixBots sale was followed by the official launch of what MixMob believes is the first-ever card strategy racing game, called MixMob: Racer 1 . The game is based on \"race-to-earn\" gameplay mechanics that enable crypto enthusiasts, degens and gamers to earn exciting crypto rewards.\n\nRacer 1 vastly expands the utility of the $MXM token , providing an incentive for players and for those who simply want to spectate and earn rewards for referrals and their participation in governance. MixMob uniquely bridges the worlds of eSports and Web3, with the MXM League establishing regular race schedules and tournaments with different tiers. Governance is the duty of $MXM token holders, meaning MixMob players get to decide on the specifics of each tournament and race. The in-game racing venues, called Turbo Arenas, also serve as liquidity pools, encouraging $MXM holders to stake their tokens to engage in governance, form and manage teams, unlock rewards for their contributions, access premium items and earn a percentage of each arena's revenue.\n\nThe $MXM token will be listed on Bybit and other leading exchange platforms. To prevent external market forces, including exchanges, from adversely affecting the $MXM token economy, MixMob will also launch a Solana-based soulbound token called $SUDS, which can only be exchanged within MixMob's gaming ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nMixMob is backed by key names within the crypto ecosystem including Arthur Hayes, Solana, Alex Svanevik of Nansen, DeFiance Capital, Infinity Ventures, , IOSG Ventures and Shima Capital. It has raised more than $10.5 million to date.\n\nAbout MixMob\n\nMixMob is a Solana-powered Web3 gaming platform on Remix Culture that caters to the needs of gamers, crypto gamblers and degens alike.
