        "title": "This Analyst Thinks Solana Is Paying Exorbitantly For Higher Bandwidth - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "David Hoffman, a crypto analyst and Ethereum influencer, has picked out a concerning disconnect in Solana relating to the number of SOL issued and the fees the network captures. Taking to X, the social media platform, Hoffman said Solana distributes roughly $1.8 million worth of SOL daily while only capturing a fraction in fees at approximately $40,000.\n\nSolana Overpaying For A Higher Bandwidth?\n\nHoffman\u2019s breakdown implies that Solana, unlike other popular networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, is paying exorbitantly for the cost of bandwidth. In blockchain, bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred every second. This figure varies with legacy networks, including Ethereum and Bitcoin, having some of the lowest in the sphere.\n\nSolana, like Ethereum, supports smart contracts, but the processing speed is higher, making the network more scalable. Looking at other metrics, including TPS, Solana has over 4,800, while Ethereum can only process 15 at peaks.\n\nMoreover, bandwidth data shows that Solana can process 125 MB of data at spot rates on average, while Ethereum performs dismally, only processing 0.08 MB every second. In public networks, bandwidth directly impacts the network\u2019s TPS, influencing scalability. The higher the bandwidth, the more a blockchain can process transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s scalability has other far-reaching implications, especially on fees created, directly influencing revenue. To illustrate, when there is a spike in activity, Ethereum tends to struggle, forcing gas fees higher and helping the network to churn even more revenue on behalf of validators.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana\u2019s high TPS can translate to relatively low transaction fees, meaning validators collect lower revenue, regardless of the state of demand. This correlation seems to be the basis of Hoffman\u2019s argument since a blockchain\u2019s bandwidth is directly influenced by the number of validators deployed.\n\nEthereum Generates 70x In Daily Fees Than Solana\n\nData confirms that Ethereum generates the highest fees in crypto. Fees paid are directly influenced by activity and scalability, with users having to pay more for on-demand block space in Ethereum.\n\nAs of September 26, Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2014first-generation blockchains\u2014generated $2.8 million and over $869,000 in fees. Meanwhile, Solana collected around $39,000 in fees, roughly six times less than those churned by the BNB Chain and considerably less than protocols launched in Ethereum. Uniswap v3 on Ethereum churned over $569,000 in fees.\n\nSolana developers plan to launch the Firedancer validator client that promises 10X bandwidth. The new client plans to increase performance, adopting a new transaction processing model and unique data structures. Whether it will find adoption is yet to be seen. However, if it gains traction, Solana will have higher bandwidth and scalability, lowering fees.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Solana Price Prediction As Network Revives Focus On DeFi, Will SOL Rally? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Solana continued to fall within a descending channel that has been developing since mid-July. The smart contracts token encountered a tough resistance at $28 which curtailed gains above the coveted $30 level.\n\nDespite holding firmly to support established at $17.5, recovery has been elusive, especially due to the seller congestion at $20, coinciding with the descending channel\u2019s upper boundary.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSOL is down nearly 3% on Wednesday to $18.97. If bulls don\u2019t push for an immediate reversal, the down leg will stretch to test the channel\u2019s lower boundary support around $17.\n\nSolana Price Invalidates The Uptrend\n\nSolana\u2019s live price sits below three key moving averages on the daily chart; starting with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) at $20.23, the 100-day EMA (blue) at $20.74 and the 200-day EMA (purple) at $21.76.\n\nThis position reinforces the bearish grip while dampening recovery attempts. In other words, sentiment among traders remains negative and deprives the asset of the much-needed momentum to rally.\n\nFor instance, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator sent a buy signal around mid-September. Traders jumped on the call to buy SOL building momentum for the rebound from $17.5 but resistance at $20 in conjunction with the above moving averages killed the bullish outlook.\n\nThe descending channel will keep Solana in a downtrend unless bulls rally behind the smart contracts token and push aggressively above $20. Such a move would be the signal traders and investors sitting on the sidelines need to return to the market and keep the uptrend sustained for gains above $30.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) has given up on the bid for recovery above the midline and is now dropping toward the oversold area suggesting that the downtrend is far from over. In that case, other key levels to watch keenly apart from the descending channel are the support areas at $16.5 and $14.5.\n\nSolana Launches New DeFi Strategy\n\nSolana has admitted that the network is facing difficulties in the competitive decentralized fianc\u00e9 sector (DeFi) and believes its new strategy would help it regain its foothold and attract an extensive user base.\n\nThe first approach involves the introduction of points programs on various protocols within the ecosystem, including Cypher, MarginFi, Jito, and entrant. These points programs aim to reward and incentivize user contributions, thus encouraging participation in the Solana DeFi ecosystem.\n\nSolana is also putting in a lot of effort to improve the Total Value Locked (TVL) in its ecosystem. Based on data by DefiLlama, the network\u2019s TVL has soared in the past few weeks from $296 million to $312 million.\n\nHowever, Solana is still facing more difficulties with the protocol\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes falling drastically. DEX volumes are key to the vitality of the DeFi protocol and determine Solana\u2019s prospects in the sector.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "What Is Solana and What Are Its Applications - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Since the invention of distributed ledger technology, blockchain technology has changed the financial world as well as countless other industries that benefit from its features. Many different blockchain networks have popped up over the years each with its unique take on how it can be used.\n\nSolana is a blockchain network that has managed to make a splash in the industry, mostly due to how versatile and useful it can be for many different commercial and financial activities. In this article, we\u2019ll go in-depth over what Solana is, how it works, and what are its applications.\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nSolana is a blockchain network created by a Swiss non-profit called Swiss Solana Foundation. The goal of the project was to create a blockchain network that will be resistant to censorship as much as it can be. It was introduced in 2017 based on the white paper created by Anatoly Yakovenko, a software engineer from Dropbox.\n\nIt uses what\u2019s known as \u201cproof of history\u201d as a way to validate and control transactions. Proof of history allows blockchain nodes to validate transactions simultaneously. This feature enabled the blockchain network to complete transactions at a faster rate, making it closer to conventional payment systems.\n\nWhat are the Features of Solana?\n\nSolana comes with most of the features of the older blockchain networks and with some of its own. These allow the transactions to be performed in a scalable way, which means it will continue to grow as it expands to more users.\n\nOpen Source Code\n\nSolana has open source code meaning that anyone who downloads the source code can change it and make it suitable to their own needs and uses. This feature isn\u2019t unique to Solana and many other blockchain networks use it and implement it.\n\nSOL\n\nSolana has its own native currency, called Solana or simply SOL. There are also smaller denominations called Lamports, named after Leslie Lamport, an American scientist, known for his work in computer engineering.\n\nProof of Stake\n\nSOL uses proof of stake similar to that of Bitcoin to confirm transactions. This feature also isn\u2019t new or unique but it\u2019s implemented using advanced technology and allowing SOL transactions to boast that they are easy to keep track of and impossible to scam.\n\nProof of History\n\nProof of history is the main claim to fame for Solana, as it\u2019s not something other cryptocurrencies are using. Proof of History (PoH) is a consensus method that takes the time of a transaction and merges it with Proof of Stake to process the transaction. With PoH, Solana uses a synchronized clock for the entire blockchain. PoH can be used by a validator to get a replay of events within the blockchain.\n\nFrom the user's standpoint, this simply means that the transactions made in SOL are much faster than with most alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat are the Main Uses for Solana?\n\nThere are many different uses for Solana blockchain that stem from its unique technological feature and the ability to quickly upscale the currency and add a lot of new users.\n\nGames\n\nOne of the main commercial uses of Solana and its cryptocurrency is in gambling games. Solana casino games have popped up and found their audience mostly with young and tech-savvy players. Many of these games use the so-called play-to-earn systems, where the players add up their wins in traditional betting games and get payouts in Solana.\n\nFast and anonymous payments are especially important to those who bet online and that\u2019s why Solana has quickly established itself as a favorite in the betting industry.\n\nDecentralized Financial Institutions\n\nDecentralized financial institutions also known as DeFis provide all the services that are usually provided by traditional financial institutions \u2013 such as banks. These services are provided without the centralized structure of a bank and they are the main attraction of using Solana for most users.\n\nThe most used DeFis provided by Solana are exchanges, digital wallets, and automated financial contract systems. Solana is also the backbone of many different cryptocurrencies such as Saber. It\u2019s used for cross-currency margin trading.\n\nLending Protocols\n\nSolana allows its users to use traditional banking services backed by its cryptocurrencies. This includes the ability to lend and borrow funds in crypto. The payments can be automated, which makes the contracts more secure than those in fiat currencies and the users are allowed to earn interest in the process.\n\nNFT Apps\n\nSolana entered the NFT application market as soon as it became popular. The apps are used to mint and then trade digital artwork. The users can create and sell their own NFTs or they can assimilate the artwork within a Solana game. There are a few marketplaces for NFTs, which include: Metaplex and Solanart. Over the last couple of months, Solana NFTs have increased in sales at a rate of about 80 percent.\n\nWeb3 Apps\n\nOne of the most forward-looking applications of Solana blockchain is its use in modern applications that take advantage of its innovative technology. The apps are as decentralized as the cryptocurrency and its uses stem from that.\n\nA few examples of such apps include:\n\nDispatch : an analytics platform that enables application developers to track user engagements.\n\n: an analytics platform that enables application developers to track user engagements. Squads : a Solana-based treasury fund management application.\n\n: a Solana-based treasury fund management application. Audius: a decentralized audio streaming app.\n\nWhat Makes Solana Different?\n\nNot all features Solana has to offer are unique, some are just basic features of blockchain but done with a twist. However, Solana is somewhat different from cryptocurrencies due to how those features are used and implemented.\n\nResistant to Censorship\n\nIn the world of blockchain, censorship means blocking network activity by not allowing some nodes to join the network. It\u2019s meant to prevent adding new blocks to the blockchain. It can happen due to malfunctioning nodes or intentional sabotage.\n\nSolana rotates nodes in order to prevent this issue in particular. This was its initial selling point since it was designed in 2017.\n\nGreat Transaction Speeds\n\nSome of the most popular cryptocurrencies such as and have rather slow transaction speeds. Solana has a very short block time and thus achieves much greater speeds than most other cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s especially useful when processing payments.\n\nOnline games and shopping are therefore the areas where Solana excels as those are the areas where users want the transaction to be done immediately.\n\nScalability\n\nSolana handles high volumes of traffic better than most blockchains of the first and second generations. Ecosystem architecture is one of the most important features of modern application development as it allows users to connect their devices, services, and platforms into one organized system. It\u2019s these uses that are best suited to Solana.\n\nTo Sum Up\n\nSolana is a blockchain network known for its innovative technology. It\u2019s specially made to prevent censorship and it accomplishes that by rotating block nodes. Solana can be used for online gambling, decentralized financial institutions, and for development of Web3 apps.\n\nSolana is easy to scale, it has faster transaction speeds when compared to most competitors, and it\u2019s the blockchain behind a few popular cryptocurrencies. There are plenty of different blockchain networks out there and it\u2019s not easy to be compared to blockchain or ETH, but Solana is able to compete with the best of the industry."
