        "title": "RNDR surges 50% in two days after community approved Solana expansion - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "According to the CryptoSlate data, the Render Network token (RNDR) recorded a 43% surge in two days after the community approved the network\u2019s Solana (SOL) expansion.\n\nThe Render community approved two proposals, RNP-002 and RNP-003, on April 26 \u2014 which determined an expansion to the SOL blockchain and a new method of allocating network resources.\n\nThe surge\n\nCryptoSlate data indicates that the RNDR token was being traded for around $1.7911 on April 26. As of April 28, the price increased as high as $2.5615 \u2014 marking a 43% increase in two days.\n\nAt the time of writing, the RND token is being traded for around $2.5381 \u2014 reflecting a 36.32% increase over the last seven days. The token\u2019s current price also marks a 98% and 68% surge in the previous 30 days and 365 days, respectively.\n\nRNP-002\n\nThe RNP-002 proposal was titled \u201cLayer-1 Network Expansion\u201d and offered to move the Render protocol to SOL blockchain as the Layer-1 network. Around 4.8 million voters approved the proposal, \u2014 opposed to roughly 36,000 who rejected it \u2014 resulting in a 99.26% acceptance rate.\n\nWhen the proposal was first launched, the Render Network founder Jules Urbach described the benefits of the proposal by stating:\n\n\u201cSolana has the right mix of speed without compromising security (vs side-chain approaches). I think if nothing else we need to ensure we get fast speed, but never at the expense of security in the long run.\n\nApproval of the proposal determined the decision to deploy its Burn-and-Mint Equilibrium (BME) model to the SOL blockchain.\n\nRNP-003\n\nThe RNP-003 proposal, titled \u201cResource Acquisition and Allocation for Core Team and Grants,\u201d was also approved by 99.9% of the community, with nearly 4.7 million supporting votes as opposed to 4,900 rejecting.\n\nThe RNP-003 offered to put governance and control in the hands of the Render community \u2014 which was perceived as a significant step towards decentralization. When announcing the results, the Render team stated that the approval would allow them \u201cto acquire and allocate resources to bring products and growth initiatives to life.\u201d\n\nThis was mentioned by the Render team when the proposal was first published. The team stated that they\u2019d propose further RNPs that can introduce better mechanisms for increasing liquidity and provider rewards once the RNP-003 was approved."

        "title": "Render (RNDR) Continues Hotstreak as Preparations Begin for Transition from Ethereum to Solana - Securities.io",
        "content": "Over the past week, few projects have performed as well as Render (RNDR). With powerful GPUs more commonplace now than ever before, Render provides owners with the ability to contribute processing power when not in use. This provides owners with a modest means of passive income, made possible through the RNDR token, while simultaneously giving content creators access to rendering services through the distributed network \u2013 saving time, and money along the way.\n\nWith the rise of the metaverse and rendering needs across a variety of industries, this has unsurprisingly resulted in Render garnering quite a bit of attention as of late; which brings us to why RNDR has been spiking \u2013 community agreeance on preparation for future demand.\n\nSolidity Out, Rust In\n\nFor Render to scale its network, and prepare for its anticipated future demand, developers behind the project noted that a shift away from Solidity and the Ethereum network was needed. With this in mind, developers put forth a proposal to the Render community that would see the project transition towards building its network with Rust atop the Solana network instead.\n\nWhen it put forth this proposal, stated to have been generated after an \u2018exhaustive review' of options, the developers explained that,\n\n\u201cThe Render Network has been built with a goal towards providing real-time, rendered, interactive holographic streams. This will require states to be updated dynamically, in real-time and on-chain. To do so, the network needs to be able to write high-performance code both on-chain and on GPUs. Rust can provide the Render Network greater speed and flexibility than Solidity, ultimately permitting the use of the same code for GPU render work and smart contracts. Further, the Solana virtual machine can process both C++ or Rust code and turn that into a smart contract.\u201d\n\nIt was recently announced that the voting period for this proposal, known as \u2018RNP-002', had come to an end. The result? An overwhelming ~4,800,000 voting yay, with a mere ~36,000 voting nay.\n\nIt should be noted that while nearly 5,000,000 eligible voters took part in the process, a whopping 167,000,000 did not.\n\nMarket Response\n\nBeing burdened by growth is a good problem to have. It shows both interest and demand for what Render has to offer, and with the passing of recent proposals (ie. RNP-002), it appears as though those responsible for the project are up to the task of scaling its services. The Render community appears to have recognized this, with RNDR trading accordingly.\n\nNot only is RNDR up 6% on the day, at time of writing, it is boasting gains north of 40% on the week. As it stands, the majority of trading volume for RNDR takes place on two exchanges \u2013 Binance, and Hotcoin Global.\n\nThe Front Runner\n\nWhile Render has been around for years now, having launched in 2017, it was not actually the first project to hit the market offering access to distributed computation. Another, which seasoned market participants may recognize, goes by the name of Golem.\n\nHowever, in the years since, a clear front runner between the two has emerged \u2013 Render. While Golem had its time in the spotlight years ago, it has slowly faded from prominence, retreating to the 141st largest project by marketcap, while Render has continue to rise to 59th at time of writing.\n\nTo learn more about this project, make sure to visit our Investing in Render guide."

        "title": "Blockchain transactions need more trust. A crypto credential can help. - Mastercard",
        "content": "Instilling trust in the blockchain ecosystem is a critical step toward realizing its full potential.\n\nIn recent years, crypto and blockchain have seen significant innovations contributing to a more scalable and resilient systems. At the same time, a lack of proper protections has created vulnerabilities in security and compliance, eroding the trust of consumers, businesses and governments.\n\nIn response, regulators have worked to establish meaningful regulations for the industry, while central banks and regulated financial institutions have developed a variety of solutions on public chains. But to fully implement these rules and build scalable use cases, we need a way for trusted, compliant and verifiable interactions to take place on public blockchain networks.\n\nThat\u2019s why we created Mastercard Crypto Credential. Mastercard Crypto Credential will establish a set of common standards and infrastructure that will help attest trusted interactions among consumers and businesses using blockchain networks. There are several use cases that Mastercard Crypto Credential can unlock, as consumer and business verification needs vary widely based on market and compliance requirements.\n\nFor example, the Mastercard Music Pass NFT, which we launched as an extension of the Mastercard Artist Accelerator, requires different verification criteria than does our work with Immersve, which offers consumers the ability to use crypto from their Web3 wallet to pay for everyday goods and services. Simply put, the level of verification needed for someone to receive an NFT differs greatly from the authentication required of someone to transfer digital assets from or receive assets to crypto wallets.\n\nWith Mastercard Crypto Credential, we can help ensure that those interested in interacting across Web3 environments are meeting defined standards for the types of activities they\u2019d like to pursue. Mastercard Crypto Credential will not only define verification standards and levels, but also provide necessary enabling technology to help bring more use cases to life. We\u2019re thinking about it in a few key ways:\n\nProviding easy-to-remember, straightforward aliases to help consumers share wallet addresses with one another, improving the consumer experience and reducing the potential for errors.\n\nBringing richer information to blockchain transactions through metadata, helping to define attributes of a wallet to help ensure that transactions are completed as intended (such as network type or assets supported).\n\nCiphertrace\u2019s Ciphertrace Traveler Tapping intosuite of services \u2014 including\u2014 to help verify addresses and support Travel Rule compliance for cross border transactions.\n\nJoining us on this journey are crypto wallet providers Bit2Me, Lirium, Mercado Bitcoin and Uphold, which are working with us on an initial project to enable transfers between the U.S. and Latin America and the Caribbean corridors. We\u2019re also teaming up with public blockchain network organizations Aptos Labs, Ava Labs, Polygon Labs and The Solana Foundation, who will help bring Mastercard Crypto Credential to the application developers in their ecosystems. Together, we\u2019ll collaborate to enhance verification in NFTs, ticketing, enterprise and other payments solutions.\n\nSetting up and scaling trusted ecosystems to enable commerce is not new to Mastercard. We\u2019ve done this for years in payments \u2014 pioneering innovation in identity verification and global standards. We look forward to bringing decades of experience to this space to enhance trust and work with the broader industry and governments to enable further innovation.\n\nTo learn more about Mastercard Crypto Credential, please contact cryptopartnerships@mastercard.com."
