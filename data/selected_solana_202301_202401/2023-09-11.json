        "content": "Key Takeaways FTX holds $7B in assets and $4.5B in its venture portfolio.\n\nShare this article URL Copied\n\nFTX, the now-bankrupt crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), has revealed that the exchange holds a staggering $3.4 billion in crypto assets. This includes over $1.1 billion in Solana and $560 million in Bitcoin.\n\nThe announcement comes just days before FTX\u2019s upcoming court appearance on Wednesday, September 13 in which it will seek approval to sell some crypto assets into fiat to repay creditors and reduce volatility risks.\n\nLast month, FTX proposed guidelines limiting token sales to $100 million per week. However, this limit could be raised to $200 million, depending on the circumstances.\n\nLuckily for SOL token holders, tokens held both by FTX and its affiliate, Alameda Research, are set to vest over the next few years. About 34.5M SOL tokens will be released every month until 2028. Additionally, 12M SOL tokens will unlock monthly until September 2027, while over 7.5M SOL will be fully unlocked in 2025, according to data from crypto intelligence firm Xangle.\n\nAccording to today\u2019s filing, the exchange holds around $7B in assets, including $3.4 billion in digital assets, $2.4 billion in cash, $529 million in brokerage investments at Grayscale and Bitwise, and $199 million in Bahamas properties, among others.\n\nFTX also has $4.5 billion in its venture portfolio spread across 438 investments. These include $2.9 billion in equity positions in crypto firms such as Genesis and Yugalabs. The portfolio also includes over $730 million channeled into funds like Paradigm, Kraken Ventures, Multicoin Capital, and Skybridge Capital. Additionally, the exchange has around $507 million in various tokens and has given out $368 million in loans.\n\nThe price of SOL is down 9% over the week and 2.3% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "Court documents reveal that the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX is still holding over $3 billion in assets as August 31.\n\nAs shared on the social media platform X by crypto reporter Colin Wu, on August 31, 2023, FTX was still holding almost $2 billion in Solana (SOL), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) alone.\n\n\u201cAs of August 31, FTX held a total of US$3.4 billion in crypto assets, including:\n\nUS$1.16 billion SOL\n\n$560 million BTC\n\n$192 million ETH\n\n$137 million APT (Aptos)\n\n$120 million USDT (Tether)\n\n$119 million XRP\n\n$49 million BIT (BitDAO)\n\n$46 million STG (Stargate Finance)\n\n$41 million WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)\n\n$37 million WETH (Wrapped Ethereum).\u201d\n\nAccording to Kroll Restructuring\u2019s documents, the exchange has secured funds through the Chapter 11 process. The court records indicate that $2.6 billion of debtor and non-debtor cash has been confirmed to date.\n\n\u201cThe Debtors navigated the Q1 2023 financial banking turmoil and secured fiat from over 30 separate banking institutions globally. Cash has been located and pooled within a Master account for purposes of safeguarding estate assets. Unrestricted cash has increased primarily due to venture investment monetization and stablecoin conversions.\u201d\n\nThe documents also show that FTX holds more than $500 million worth of securities in its brokerage accounts. The securities investments include $70 million in the Grayscale Ethereum trust, $36 million in the BitWise 10 Crypto Index Fund, $6 million spread across other Grayscale funds, less than $1 million in BlackRock equity, and a massive $417 million in Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin trust, which accounts for 79% of FTX\u2019s securities holdings.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
