        "title": "Frenzy for 1,000x Gains Drives Surge in New Tokens on Solana - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Frenzy for 1,000x Gains Drives Surge in New Tokens on Solana\n\nThe Solana blockchain network has experienced an unprecedented influx of new tokens this month, surpassing any previous records by a significant margin.\n\nAccording to data from Solscan, over the last two weeks alone, a staggering 72,202 new tokens have been minted on Solana using the SPL token standard.\n\nThis number is more than 71 times the amount of tokens created during a comparable period in October.\n\nThe daily statistics for new token creation on Solana are now consistently four times higher than ever before since the network\u2019s launch in 2020.\n\nWhile the Solana ecosystem has witnessed a remarkable revival in the past two months, driving up the value of SOL, Solana NFTs, Solana meme coins, and even demand for the Solana smartphone, the sudden surge in token creation cannot be solely attributed to organic growth in network activity.\n\nBlockchain investigator and Sol Incinerator project lead, known as Slorg, raised concerns about the exponential rise in token creation.\n\nSlorg discovered a fake token for Sol Incinerator on Solana and tracked its on-chain transactions.\n\nThe imposter had created dozens of new SOL coins on the same day, rapidly pumping and dumping each of them within minutes before moving on to the next token, including PUZZ, RUN, BABY DINO, and DEGEN BOT.\n\nSlorg revealed that many of the approximately 7,000 tokens launched daily on Solana are churn-style tokens created to attract attention and exploit users monitoring the \u201crecent\u201d tab on platforms like Birdeye, a popular crypto trading data aggregator.\n\nSlorg even uncovered wallet trails where an individual had launched 300 tokens themselves in just one week.\n\nNot All Solana-Based Meme Coins Are Rug Pulls\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that not every hyped Solana meme coin is a short-lived rug pull.\n\nSome tokens, like BONK, have adhered to their roadmap and gained traction with the launch of features such as the BonkBot automated trading bot.\n\nBONK was developed by a team of prominent Solana builders and enjoys robust support within the ecosystem.\n\nSimilarly, Dogwifhat has maintained a steady market cap since its launch.\n\nHowever, the success of a few tokens within the broader resurgence of Solana seems to have enticed numerous token deployers to flood the ecosystem with sham coins.\n\nMotivated by the prospect of making quick profits, these individuals launch tokens with the hope of achieving astronomical gains, disregarding the potential negative consequences.\n\n\u201cA lot of people tell me, \u2018This is the entire point of crypto,\u2019\u201d Slorg said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of demoralizing, because I think we can be so much more.\u201d\n\nAs reported, Solana\u2019s NFTs have also witnessed considerably higher trading volume, surpassing even that of Ethereum.\n\nProjects like Mad Lads and Tensorians have seen significant price increases, multiplying several times over in recent weeks.\n\nMoreover, the collective trading volume of Solana NFTs has now surpassed that of Ethereum, which traditionally leads in trading volume and hosts the most valuable projects."

        "title": "Ripple, Solana, Shiba Inu, or Bitcoin: Crypto Assets to Watch in 2024, According to ChatGPT Rival - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "2023 is at its end and can be easily categorized as a positive year for the cryptocurrency sector, especially its end. Many digital assets recorded triple- and even quadruple-digit gains, which leads to the question of what could happen in the next 12 months.\n\nAccording to a popular AI chatbot \u2013 Perplexity \u2013 several altcoins, alongside Bitcoin, stand out as the ones to watch in 2024.\n\nWill 2024 Be the Year of Bitcoin?\n\nAs reported earlier, the primary cryptocurrency outperformed almost all traditional financial assets in 2023. Its gains, even though the year still has some hours left in it, are firm within the triple-digit territory of around 150%.\n\nThe indications for next year are similarly bullish. After countless rejections of spot Bitcoin ETFs from numerous companies, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is anticipated to finally greenlight such a product, especially given the applications of behemoths like BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, WisdomTree, and others.\n\nAlthough some have warned that this could turn out to be a sell-the-news moment, mostly in the first few months, the implications of spot exchange-traded funds operating on the largest financial market in the world are highly bullish. Some expect the ETFs will result in market inflows of around $30 trillion in advised wealth in the following years.\n\nAdditionally, the fourth-ever BTC halving will take place in the spring of next year. Each previous one has served as a catalyst for a bull market start. Although history should not be regarded as an indicator of future price performances, one must not take the implications of reduced production rates lightly.\n\nAs such, Perplexity listed Bitcoin as the first digital asset to watch in 2024:\n\n\u201cBitcoin (BTC): As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to hold the top spot in market capitalization and is considered the best crypto by many.\u201d\n\nSOL, XRP, ETH, and SHIB\n\nNext on the list of Perplexity\u2019s cryptocurrencies to watch in 2024 was Ethereum. Being the second-largest digital asset, it certainly earned its place. Moreover, ETH is among the underperformers this year, having surged by a modest 84%, compared to BTC\u2019s 150% rise.\n\nNevertheless, the Ethereum blockchain is home to numerous projects, tokens, and even digital asset niches. The team behind the protocol, including the co-founder Vitalik Buterin, is constantly working on improving the network, which could ultimately benefit ETH holders in 2024.\n\nSolana was mentioned next, which is quite expected. SOL has been the top performer from the larger-cap altcoins, having soared by 670% YTD. Its price blew past $100 earlier in December and even neared $130 at one point but has retraced since then.\n\nSolana has outperformed Ethereum on multiple fronts in the past month or so, as reported recently. As such, there\u2019s a lot of hype around the network and the native asset for the upcoming year.\n\n\u201cSolana (SOL): Solana is a layer-1 blockchain platform that has been growing rapidly and is considered a top cryptocurrency to watch,\u201d \u2013 said Perplexity.\n\nRipple\u2019s own token also found a place on the AI chatbot\u2019s list for digital assets to watch in 2024. XRP soared after Ripple\u2019s two court victories in 2023 against the US SEC but has retraced since then and currently stands with YTD gains of around 80%.\n\nNevertheless, the battle with the US securities regulator is far from over and is expected to come to an end somewhere in 2024. This undoubtedly places XRP and the entire Ripple ecosystem on the list of digital assets to watch next year, given the implications of proving whether or not the token is actually a security.\n\nOn the other hand, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Terra\u2019s LUNC are the two coins that found a place in Perplexity\u2019s honorable mentions list."

        "title": "Can Solana (SOL) Continue Its Path Up in 2024? - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAs we traverse into 2024, the trajectory of Solana becomes a pivotal question for the cryptocurrency market. A glance at the Solana chart reveals strong growth, followed by a recent phase of correction. The moving averages have aligned in a manner that suggests a strong bullish trend with the price consistently staying above these indicators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, SOL has recently experienced a pullback, hinting at a period of consolidation. This could be attributed to active profit-taking from venture capitalists (VCs), which was a foreseen event given the asset\u2019s substantial appreciation over the past months. The retracement is also part of the natural market cycle following such an impressive rally.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem has seen significant growth, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the proliferation of meme coins. The rapid expansion of DeFi on Solana has been fueled by its high transaction throughput and relatively low fees, making it a competitive environment for DeFi applications. The meme coin phenomenon has also found a foothold on Solana, attracting both positive attention for its viral nature and negative scrutiny due to the high magnitude of scams and market manipulations associated with this niche.\n\nWhile these factors have contributed to Solana\u2019s visibility and adoption, they have also led to increased volatility. The ecosystem's resilience is being tested as it navigates the fallout from various high-profile scams and manipulative practices, most notably within the meme coin market. These events have triggered skepticism among investors, as they weigh the platform's innovative potential against the risks posed by these malicious activities.\n\nLooking forward, for Solana to continue its upward path, the ecosystem will need to address these challenges head-on. Enhancements in security protocols, more rigorous vetting of projects and an overall shift toward more sustainable and utility-driven applications will be critical. The network's capability to scale effectively, maintain uptime and foster a secure environment for both DeFi and other applications will be key determinants of its trajectory.\n\nDespite the current correction and associated challenges, the fundamentals of Solana, especially its blockchain's architecture designed for speed and efficiency, remain strong. If the community and developers can collaborate to bolster the network's robustness against scams and ensure a more stable platform, Solana has the potential to resume its upward trend. The path forward for SOL will likely hinge on its ability to mature as an ecosystem, prioritizing security and long-term utility over the transient hype of meme coins and speculative ventures.\n\nNew year for Ethereum\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) steps into 2024, its market position appears to be on the cusp of transformation. The past year has seen significant developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, notably the expansion of Layer 2 (L2) networks and the unveiling of a refreshed road map by Vitalik Buterin, presenting a new vision for the platform. These changes may have set the stage for a potential price reversal for Ethereum as it continues to navigate its current rally.\n\nThe price chart of Ethereum indicates a mixed scenario. After a period of bullish trend, ETH is showing signs of consolidation. The moving averages are providing support at lower levels, and the price is oscillating around these key indicators, suggesting a balancing act between bullish optimism and bearish caution.\n\nThe L2 networks, like Arbitrum and Optimism, have been a beacon of growth, with transaction volume skyrocketing by 90 times compared to 2021. This incredible expansion signifies a shift in focus to scalability and efficiency. The L2 solutions are not just a technical improvement but also a strategic realignment, positioning Ethereum to better handle the burgeoning demands of DeFi, NFTs and other blockchain applications.\n\nButerin's new Ethereum vision, which emphasizes single slot finality, cross-rollup standards and the inclusion of Verkle trees, points to a more secure, efficient and scalable network. The road map update also hints at long-term improvements to Ethereum's architecture, ensuring its place at the forefront of blockchain innovation.\n\nDespite these promising developments, Ethereum's price rally has been lagging when compared to some of its competitors. This underperformance could be due to market dynamics that have seen investors chase higher yields elsewhere. However, the solid rise in traction on L2 networks suggests that the groundwork is being laid for a more robust and expansive ecosystem."

        "content": "Ethereum is out and Solana is in.\n\nEthereum, its mess of layer-2s and neverending scaling roadmap are doomed to be usurped by its younger \u201cmonolithic\u201d rival.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what the rabblers on X are saying.\n\nThe sagging ETH-to-BTC ratio surely isn\u2019t helping. Bitcoin has swelled 160% this year, while ETH hasn\u2019t even doubled. Anyone who sold their bitcoin for ether in January would\u2019ve so far lost a quarter of their BTC on that trade.\n\nSolana\u2019s bitcoin ratio is up more than 300%. SOL\u2019s dollar price is now 10 times what it was at the start of the year, although it\u2019s still down almost two-thirds from its record high at the top of the last bull market.\n\nSolana truthers would also point to the network\u2019s cheap fees and engaged community, which have lately inspired a boom in Solana-native NFTs, memecoins and decentralized exchanges. Solana even flipped Ethereum for DEX volume for the first time earlier this month.\n\nProjects are now plotting additional airdrops to incentivize on-chain Solana activity, hinting at far more buzz to come.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Vitalik fans.\n\nAn Ethereum vibecession may have given way to a Solanaissance, but these charts should pick up your spirits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s number has definitely gone up\n\nOne could sift through the minutiae of blockchain tech stacks \u2014 debate the finer points of the appchain thesis and the security concerns surrounding consensus. Or, we could just focus on price.\n\nEther\u2019s earliest recorded price was $3 when it opened trade way back in 2015. ETH now trades for $2,300 \u2014 a 76,000% return over its whole history (not counting the additional gains made on its ICO price).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time returns would completely dwarf ether\u2019s and solana\u2019s. Let\u2019s just pretend they wouldn\u2019t\n\nSolana has done well but not that well, posting a meager 40,000% since its debut in mid-2020, about half ether\u2019s returns.\n\nAnd we all know that markets are always right.\n\nEvery second dollar locked is on Ethereum\n\nCrypto has so many use cases. You can buy other cryptocurrencies with it. You can buy NFTs with it, and maybe some Dallas Mavericks merchandise.\n\nYou can even buy movie tickets or Adidas shoes with crypto \u2014 although you\u2019ll have to send your bitcoin to a payment processor who will dump it for fiat on behalf of the merchant.\n\nIf using crypto as actual money doesn\u2019t appeal, you could always lock it up in a blockchain and earn yield on it. Maybe even lend it out to other people who might buy other cryptocurrencies with it.\n\nEven Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum has more TVL than Solana\n\nThere\u2019s about $53 billion in crypto locked up in DeFi protocols, and more than half of that is on Ethereum. Only 2.6% is staked with Solana platforms, equal to about $1.4 billion.\n\nTVL gets a bad rap by those who say it doesn\u2019t properly reflect how people interact with competing blockchains. Ignore them, they\u2019re probably Solana fans.\n\nUsers pay more to use Ethereum (a good thing)\n\nWe get it, there are cheaper blockchains to use than Ethereum. Solana is one of them.\n\nLow fees are great for anyone who wants to wash trade NFTs and memecoins, but they\u2019re not so great if you want people to actually make money by contributing to the network.\n\nEthereum users have paid more than $2.3 billion to use the blockchain this year. Over on Solana, users have forked out less than $20 million \u2014 under 1% of Ethereum fees.\n\nEven ignoring Ethereum, crypto users have paid way more to use Bitcoin and Tron than Solana\n\nGranted, Ethereum fees don\u2019t go directly to validators anymore, they\u2019re instead burned to reduce the supply, which, in a roundabout way, benefits all ETH holders.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, subsidizes the network\u2019s low fees by printing tokens, effectively penalizing all SOL holders with inflation.\n\nActive addresses and where to find them\n\nUntil we all scan our eyeballs with the Worldcoin orb and blend our biometrics with the blockchain, nailing down exactly how many people really use crypto is practically impossible.\n\nAll that shouldn\u2019t get in the way of pretending.\n\nAdding up the cumulative number of active addresses every day this year across 29 different blockchains shows Ethereum, Solana and even Bitcoin aren\u2019t even the most popular chains.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many of these are unique individuals. Whatever, big numbers are good numbers\n\nThe cumulative daily active addresses for Justin Sun\u2019s Tron is almost 600 million. Binance\u2019s BNB Chain has attracted more than three times the active addresses of Solana.\n\nEthereum mainnet\u2019s count is only slightly ahead of Solana\u2019s, but including layer-2s like zkSync Era, Arbitrum and Optimism gives more than 300 million.\n\nEthereum against the world (wide web 2.0)\n\nCrypto market caps are terribly inaccurate. They\u2019re easily gamed, never take lost supplies into account and hardly ever reflect the real liquidity of the underlying token.\n\nThis often results in valuations far higher than what could be realistically extracted from the market itself. Sounds bad, but most of that can be also said of market capitalizations for stocks.\n\nIn any case, if Ethereum was a stock, with which industries would it compete?\n\nSure, comparing crypto to stocks is apples to oranges. It still feels right\n\nEthereum\u2019s whole \u201cworld computer\u201d shtick could force it alongside cloud stocks like Amazon, Cisco and IBM. The network\u2019s power to process stablecoin payments would otherwise put it against PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s market cap, averaged out over the past six months, is three times PayPal\u2019s and seven times more than the stock valuation of Cash App creator Block (formerly Square).\n\nSolana\u2019s current market cap is now above Block\u2019s, but its average since June is lower than all of them.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.
