        "content": "The Solana Beach School District board expressed confidence in Superintendent Jodee Brentlinger\u2019s positive leadership with a vote to extend her contract through June 30, 2027.\n\nAt the Aug. 10 meeting, the board approved the fifth amendment to Brentlinger\u2019s employment contract which not only lengthened her employment by one year but also increased her salary to $251,300, representing a 4.3% raise.\n\nSuperintendent Jodee Brentlinger, right, visits Solana Ranch on the first day of school with board member Vicki King and staff member. (SBSD)\n\n\u201cShe has been an incredible and exceptional leader through a very significant paradigm shift in education in this country and has brought the district out of an unusual time, back to normal. Not a lot of districts were able to make that shift so seamlessly like the Solana Beach School District has under her leadership,\u201d SBSD President Debra Schade said. \u201cWe are really excited that she is part of our governance team...we really are focused on making really wonderful things happen for the brighter futures of our students.\u201d\n\nAt the meeting, Brentlinger thanked the board for their support as she embarks on another school year with an \u201camazing\u201d group of professionals, staff, teachers and board governance team, \u201caspiring to greatness.\u201d As she has every year, on the first day of school Aug. 14 Brentlinger visited all seven district schools, switching into each school\u2019s spirit gear, logging over 10,000 steps and greeting students in over 125 classrooms.\n\nIn her comments, board member Julie Union said it is inspiring to watch Brentlinger\u2019s personal interactions when she is at the schools as it is obvious that she truly loves children. In the past five years, Union said Brentlinger has brought about a positive culture and \u201cunity of purpose\u201d throughout the board and the entire district.\n\n"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether dip amid low volatility; Solana gains - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat on Tuesday afternoon in Asia to stay range bound above the US$29,000 support level. Ether dipped, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower, with Solana\u2019s SOL the only one strengthening. The Forkast 500 NFT index moved up after the NFT market saw the largest weekly total transactions since February 2022. Most Asian stock markets dropped after China unexpectedly lowered its interest rate on Tuesday morning and released weaker-than-expected economic data. U.S. stock futures also declined and European bourses traded lower.\n\nBitcoin, Ether flat; Solana rises\n\nBitcoin remained unchanged in the last 24 hours to trade at US$29,380.78 as of 5 p.m. in Hong Kong, and logged a weekly gain of 0.82%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly reached a high of US$29,660.25 early Tuesday morning.\n\nBitcoin prices are below its 50-day moving average of US$29,887, with its 30-day realized volatility falling to 17%, the lowest since November 2018, which both indicate bearishness in the token, Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed note on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cGreed & Fear Index prints 54% for Bitcoin, above the 21-day moving average which signals that a rally could occur imminently,\u201d added Thielen.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has remained largely within at US$29,000-30,600 for the past seven weeks, causing frustration among investors seeking higher rewards. However, low volatility could prove to be a blessing in disguise, said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThis newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cThis stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,\u201d he added.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending Aug. 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Bitcoin saw an inflow of US$27 million \u2014 roughly 93% of the total inflows.\n\nThe inflows to digital asset investment products are \u201clikely due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,\u201d CoinShares wrote in the report.\n\nEther dipped 0.33% to US$1,840.95 but added 0.71% for the past seven days. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded lower with the exception of Solana\u2019s SOL, which moved up 1.39% to US$24.82 and gained 7.09% for the week.\n\nSynthesis One, an artificial intelligence (AI) data crowdsourcing platform based on the Solana blockchain, launched its new train-to-earn application \u201cWorkspace by Synesis\u201d on Monday.\n\nThe app allows users to train AIs as data providers while earning cryptocurrencies as rewards. This process, Synthesis One claims, will result in a \u201cfully traceable and auditable\u201d data supply chain.\n\nShiba Inu, which has recently replaced Polkadot as the 10th biggest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market cap, led the losers, falling 2.89% to US$0.00001028 while logging a weekly jump of 14.51%\n\nThe token received a boost from the incoming launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 network built by Shiba Inu developers whose launch date is yet to be unveiled.\n\nBlockchain analytics platform Lookonchain noted Tuesday that bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital had been selling its assets including Shiba Inu, which could weaken the upward trend in the token.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.18% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume edged up 7.75% to US$26.17 billion.\n\nWeekly NFT transactions rise to year-high\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index moved up 0.27% in the past 24 hours to 2,482.04 as of 17:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, and up 0.05% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano NFT indexes also logged gains, while the index for Solana dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 28.04% in the past 24 hours to over US$17.71 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all logged double-digit gains, while volumes on the Bitcoin blockchain shrank.\n\nIn the week ending Aug. 13, NFT sales topped US$101 million after sitting short of US$100 million for three consecutive weeks. NFT transactions for the week exceeded 2.8 million, a high since February 2022.\n\nOn the past week\u2019s surge in NFT sales, Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, said that he saw the emergence of low-priced collections as key to a sustained potential uptick in the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a glimpse of the future of NFTs. More affordable prices, higher volume, likely big brands and this is what we\u2019re seeing in DraftKings, DMarket, Gods Unchained, and Sorare,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nCombined, Petscher noted, those three collections alone notched 872,185 transactions \u2014 nearly a third of the week\u2019s total transactions.\n\n\u201cThe question is, is this sustainable? I think it is, and that\u2019s exactly why this will be the future. Traders haven\u2019t really left NFT, they just ran out of liquidity since there\u2019s no profits. But they can afford NFTs that are priced at just a few dollars,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based DeGods saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, surging 255.38% to over US$2.92 million after the project launched its \u201cSeason 3\u201d digital art collection on Sunday.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mythos Chain-based DMarket, ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained and Polygon-based DraftKings took up the rest of the top five NFT collections in terms of 24-hour sales volume.\n\nAdidas Originals, a subdivision of sports apparel corporation Adidas, will launch its first NFT auction on Aug. 22 in collaboration with crypto payment platform Moonpay.\n\nThe auction will feature 100 \u201cproduct-linked\u201d NFTs, each of which can be later redeemed for a pair of limited-edition sneakers in the real world as well as a digital replica.\n\nMost Asia stock markets drop, U.S. equities down\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures slid as of 18:30 p.m. in Hong Kong following gains at the close of trading Monday, while the main stock indexes traded mixed. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all logged losses, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved higher.The stock market took a blow after China\u2019s central bank unexpectedly lowered the rate of its medium-term lending facility (MLF) by 15 basis points to 2.5% on Tuesday morning, only two months after the previous rate cut in June.\n\n\u201cThe slightly earlier timing and a larger than expected 15 basis point rate cut of MLF show that Beijing feels the urgency to take more policy easing actions to stabilize expectations and growth,\u201d Xiaojia Zhi, chief China economist at international banking group Credit Agricole, told Bloomberg, adding that China could see more monetary easing in the coming months.\n\n\u201c(The rate cut in China) is a positive but I suspect the support to the market from this will be subdued and short-lived,\u201d Redmond Wong, a market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Hong Kong, told Bloomberg in another Tuesday report. \u201cInvestors now are worried about credit events, not just from the ailing property sector.\u201d\n\nThe decision was announced shortly before China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics reported disappointing economic data for July. That data included a rise in the urban unemployment rate, as well as decelerated and smaller-than-expected growth in retail sales and industrial production, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nU.S. global investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a Sunday note it expected the Federal Reserve to start cutting the interest rates in the second quarter of 2024 and keep the rates unchanged at its next meeting in September, Bloomberg reported on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inflation is closer to target,\u201d wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in the Sunday note.\n\nU.S. investors now await the release of retail sales data on Tuesday, followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes on Wednesday, for further insight on the health of the U.S. economy and the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level since January 2001. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 88.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September.\n\nElsewhere, European bourses traded lower on Tuesday, with the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 both dropping during afternoon hours in Asia.\n\nStocks in U.K. and Sweden spearheaded the drop in the European markets, as a strong wage increase in the U.K. and high inflation data in Sweden triggered fears of more interest rate hikes, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"
