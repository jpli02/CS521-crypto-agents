        "content": "Altcoin Crypto Funds Like Ethereum and Solana See Outflows After Bitcoin ETFs Launch\n\nA new report from digital asset fund manager CoinShares reveals that investors are withdrawing funds from high-profile crypto funds following the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this month. According to CoinShares, investors pulled $21 million out of crypto funds issuers last week.\n\nCoinShares suggests that investors seeking exposure to digital assets are shifting their money into the new Bitcoin ETFs. The report notes that \"incumbent, higher cost issuers suffered in the U.S., seeing $2.9 billion of outflows, while newly issued ETFs have now seen a total of $4.13 billion inflows since launch.\"\n\nIn contrast, short Bitcoin products, which bet on the price of crypto going down, received inflows of around $13 million, as investors bet on further price weakness from Bitcoin. Other altcoin funds providing exposure to Ethereum and Solana also experienced outflows, reaching $14 million and $8.5 million respectively.\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10 marked a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. Of the 10 ETFs currently trading, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust is the best performer, with $1.3 billion in assets under management.\n\nHowever, Grayscale, which manages billions of dollars worth of crypto assets, has experienced significant outflows. The Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recently converted to a Bitcoin ETF, and investors have been cashing out rapidly. CoinShares reports that over $2.2 billion has been withdrawn from GBTC since its conversion.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "While the crypto board is declining amid Grayscale\u2019s offloading Bitcoin BTC/USD, a crypto analyst believed Ethereum ETH/USD could likely outperform Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Happened: Until midday trade, the cryptocurrency board was drenched in red amidst Grayscale offloading Bitcoin holdings worth $2.14 billion.\n\nSolana SOL/USD saw a 9.4% decline followed by a 6% decrease in Ethereum. Also, XRP XRP/USD and Cardano ADA/USD saw a 4.6% and 5.9% drop, respectively.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s weekly and monthly performance do not highlight significant gains, in the past two months it reported a 13.4% surge significantly higher compared to 7% in Bitcoin gains.\n\nEthereum's Strengths: Ethereum is adding feathers to its cap with the Dencun upgrade hitting the network\u2019s three testnets in early 2024. This will increase transaction speed and lower gas fees.\n\nCointelegraph cited Nebojsa Urosevic, co-founder of Ethereum development platform Tenderly, who believed Dencun to mostly lower rollup transaction costs by up to 10 times, depending on blob space demand.\n\nLookonchain data indicated whales are significantly accumulating Ethereum today totaling 26,841 Ethereum worth $64.5 million. Around 7,779 Ethereum ($18.7M) was withdrawn from Binance while 8,077 Ethereum ($19.4M) from Bitfinex. Similarly, there were many other transactions indicating withdrawals from Binance and Kraken.\n\nAlso Read: Arthur Hayes On Bitcoin: 'I Think We Break $40K,' Traders See 'Halving In 4 Months' For Next Price Upswing\n\nBased on DefiLlama data, Ethereum\u2019s total value locked over the past month saw a 9.1% surge to $32.3 billion.\n\nAnalyst Opinion: MN Trading CEO and founder Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believed Ethereum would outperform Bitcoin in the upcoming period.\n\nIn another tweet, he also said that while Bitcoin is in the range of accumulation, altcoins \u201care in stages to be bought as those 20-40% dips are a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nAltcoin Daily tweets, \u201cEthereum is having an infinite halving\u201d\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Weighs In On BTC's Decline After ETF Launch: 'Nasty Beginning To The Bitcoin Selloff...
