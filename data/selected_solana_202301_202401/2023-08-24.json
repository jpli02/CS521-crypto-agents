        "content": "Key Takeaways The ethOS phone supports EVM chains and layer 2s.\n\nSolana's Saga phone saw a 40% price cut this month.\n\nShare this article URL Copied\n\nThe ethOS phone, the first mobile device to support EVM-based chains and layer 2s, has made waves in the Ethereum community after selling out its pre-sale in less than 24 hours. This news comes weeks after another web3 mobile phone, Solana\u2019s Saga, had its price slashed by 40%.\n\nThe ethOS phone is a revamped version of the Android-based Google Pixel 7a running on the Ethereum-native mobile operating system, ethOS. This phone runs a light Ethereum client, allowing it to verify blocks on its own and interact with Ethereum without relying on centralized infrastructure like Infura or Alchemy.\n\nThe ethOS phone comes with a built-in wallet and offers smooth compatibility with other wallets. And while the Pixel 7a is not a hardware wallet itself, it has a special security chip, known as a secure enclave, designed to safely store and encrypt private keys.\n\nOnly 50 phones were available during the pre-sale phase. Interested buyers had to mint an ethOS NFT and burn it to claim their phone. Now, these NFTs are now popping up on the NFT marketplace OpenSea, with some selling for 3 ETH, or roughly $5,000. For perspective, a regular Google Pixel 7A retails for $499 in the U.S.\n\nWhile the ethOS phone seems to be riding a wave of early success, the Solana Saga phone\u2019s sales haven\u2019t lived up to expectations. Since its April 2023 launch, only 2,120 units have been sold, according to data from FlipsideCrypto.\n\nIn a bid to boost sales, Solana Mobile slashed the price of the Saga phone from $1,000 to $599 this month.\n\nWith the ethOS phone\u2019s regular orders set to start this fall and Solana Saga looking to revamp its sales strategy, the competition in the mobile web3 space is bound to intensify."

This strategic selection aims to attract merchants more inclined to accept payment options closely aligned with the US dollar.\n\nSolana is reportedly also considering the prospective addition of other digital assets, including SOL and BONK, a Solana meme coin.\n\nIntroduced last year, Solana Pay is engineered to facilitate dollar-pegged stablecoin transactions for both vendors and shoppers. The platform is tailored for online as well as point-of-sale transactions, with the capability to handle any volume of digital dollar transfers on Solana\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem has over 11.5 million active users, with an average transaction cost of a mere $0.00025.\n\nMajor crypto entities like Circle and Phantom, along with payment processors such as Checkout.com and Citcon, have embraced Solana Pay.\n\nAdditionally, Solana projects like MonkeDAO, MadLads, Helius and Solana\u2019s merch store have incorporated Solana Pay into their Shopify-operated online shops.\n\nSolana Labs\u2019 Saga phone also supports the payment method.\n\nShopify has previously ventured into Web3 by allowing merchants to provide NFT-based loyalty incentives and directly sell NFTs to consumers.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Thu 24 Aug 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nA revolution is underway at Solana. The prestigious blockchain has welcomed EUROe, the first native euro stablecoin, carefully designed to integrate with its ecosystem. Behind this innovation stands Membrane Finance, a Finnish startup specializing in fintech blockchain. Thanks to EUROe, the happy encounter between the crypto sphere and the digital euro has finally materialized. Let\u2019s find out more.\n\nA new era for solana\n\nThe inauguration of EUROe marks a major turning point for Solana. The blockchain can now count on a native digital euro currency, with all its attendant benefits.\n\nEUROe paves the way for new blockchain applications such as currency conversions, euro card payments and value preservation.\n\nIn particular, EUROe guarantees Solana\u2019s compliance with the future MiCA regulation, due to come into force in 2024. This makes Solana a strong EVM blockchain competitor on the European market.\n\nAccording to Patrik Elias Johansson, Chief Compliance Officer at Membrane Finance, this regulation will bring \u201can unprecedented degree of accountability and protection\u201d to the crypto sector. With EUROe, Solana now ticks all the boxes to attract European companies.\n\nA compliant and secure cryptocurrency\n\nBut what is this famous EUROe? It\u2019s a stablecoin backed by the euro, with reserves fully guaranteed. Each EUROe in circulation is backed by \u20ac1 held by Membrane Finance with European financial institutions.\n\nEUROe also offers a 1% equity guarantee. This guarantees compliance with the future MiCA framework, and provides a high level of security for users. Stablecoin can be issued and spent free of charge, in a 1:1 ratio with the euro.\n\nMore good news: EUROe is already enjoying massive adoption. Since its launch, stablecoin has been supported by Wirex, a well-known crypto payment app. Its 6 million users can now use their EUROe at over 40 million merchants!\n\nWirex also makes it possible to instantly exchange EUROe for over a hundred different currencies. This makes it the perfect tool for widespread daily use of EUROe.\n\nAccording to Pavel Matveev, co-founder of Wirex, \u201cthe arrival of EUROe on Solana guarantees optimum flexibility for managing your finances\u201d.\n\nTowards the future of finance\n\nWith its speed, low costs and reliability, Solana represents the ideal terrain for a digital currency. What\u2019s more, its dynamic community will encourage the development of numerous applications around EUROe: decentralized finance, NFT, online games, etc.\n\nAccording to Juha Viitala, one of the founders of Membrane Finance, this launch marks a significant milestone: \u201cWe believe that Solana is now poised for success in Europe\u201d.\n\nThe future looks bright for blockchain, to say the least, with the long-awaited arrival of the new-generation euro. France\u2019s decision to take the next step in crypto regulation seems justified.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "External - Press Release\n\nBy: ICL PR \u2022 Loading...\n\nPress Releases\n\nAtlanta, GA, August 24th, 2023, Chainwire\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an extraordinary blending of tradition and innovation, Solana Foundation, Solana xNFT wallet Backpack, developer education platform HackQuest, and global Web3 builder community Moonshot Commons joined forces to co-host the Solana Chengdu Developer Meetup on August 12th, 2023.\n\nThe event took place at a historic venue dating back to the Chinese Qing dynasty in 1663, providing a captivating backdrop that immersed attendees in the rich heritage of the traditional culture. During the event, over 70 passionate developers and researchers in Web3 engaged in discussions centering around the thriving Solana ecosystem and exciting technological advancements.\n\nSolana, known as a proof-of-stake blockchain platform, has been a driving force behind Web3 innovation.

As Solana revitalizes its presence in the Asian market, HackQuest emerges as one of the important partners, focusing on the democratization of Web3 development.

This marks our commitment to fostering innovation, collaboration, and accessibility within the web3 ecosystem. We are excited to deepen our engagement with the Asian market and work together with strong local partners like Moonshot Commons and HackQuest to empower developers worldwide.\u201d\n\nChris, the Founder of the developer tooling platform Mirror World, also attended the event and shared his thoughts on the rapid growth of the Solana community in Asia: \"It's such a refreshing taste to see the rapid growth of the Solana community in Asia hosted by Moonshot Commons and HackQuest, especially when it comes to gaming and applications. We believe many of the Solana infrastructure improvements over the last year directly led to product adoptions on a stabler network.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, HackQuest and Moonshot Commons are committed to collaborating with Solana Foundation to foster the developer ecosystem and community. The partnership aims to support the Solana Foundation in building a thriving developer ecosystem in the Asia-Pacific region by organizing both online and offline developer activities. This remarkable collaboration sets the stage for a promising future, signaling significant advancements in blockchain technology and innovation in the APAC region as a whole.\n\nAbout Solana Foundation\n\nSolana is a Blockchain built for mass adoption: fast, composable, green, and globally distributed.
