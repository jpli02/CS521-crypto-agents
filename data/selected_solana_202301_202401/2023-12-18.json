        "content": "Users can now convert EUR to and from EURC on the high-speed blockchain.\n\nCircle has launched its euro-backed stablecoin, Euro Coin (EURC), on Solana, a blockchain known for its extremely fast transaction speeds and low fees. Solana is the fourth blockchain where EURC is available, following Avalanche, Ethereum and Stellar. Users have minted the equivalent of about \u20ac518,577 (or $566,143) of EURC on Solana since it went live earlier today.\n\nCircle, which is also the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), launched EURC in June 2022. While USDC is pegged to the dollar, EURC is pegged one-to-one to the euro under a full-reserve model that\u2019s backed by a mixture of cash and European government debt. The market capitalization of EURC has grown to more than $56 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nSolana developers and users can now build and transact across both EURC and USDC for faster, cheaper ways to transfer, spend and save money, Circle said in its announcement. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and digital wallets on Solana that can now use EURC include liquidity aggregator Jupiter Exchange, DeFi infrastructure provider Meteora, and crypto marketplace Orca, which can all enable instant forex, trading, borrowing and lending for their users.\n\n\u201cThe launch of EURC on Solana marks a significant step towards a more efficient, inclusive and user-centric financial ecosystem,\u201d said Rachel Mayer, Circle\u2019s vice president of product management, in the announcement post.\n\nSolana is the fourth-largest blockchain, ranked by total value locked (TVL), with about $1.1 billion in value, according to CoinGecko rankings. The native Solana (SOL) token has rallied this year, trading up a whopping 629% to the current $71.62. The rally was driven by a combination of network improvements, the chain\u2019s diverse range of applications including DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming, as well as active interest among derivatives traders."

        "content": "The Dec. 14 Solana Beach School District board meeting marked the last for Superintendent Jodee Brentlinger, who is retiring after 35 years in public education.\n\nAt the meeting, the board shared its gratitude for her leadership over the last five and half years, guiding schools through the pandemic, strengthening systems, and establishing stronger communications with the teachers\u2019 union.\n\nBut Brentlinger was most praised for her student-centered way, the joy everyone witnessed whenever she was in a classroom, sitting with students criss cross applesauce and how she could remember every kid\u2019s name within about three seconds.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s constantly telling us what a great board we are\u2026 but the way we have a fantastic board is first by having a fantastic superintendent. Jodee has been the finest superintendent we could possibly have,\u201d said board Vice President Dana King. \u201cShe has steadied the institution, moved us forward, brought us into a strong financial position and developed incredible connectivity with the kids\u2026 Ultimately, I just think we are the luckiest school district in the state of California and the United States to have Superintendent Jodee Brentlinger for the years that we\u2019ve had her.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks, Trustee Julie Union borrowed a quote from C.S. Lewis: \u201c\u2018Children are not a distraction for more important work, they are the most important work\u2019. Knowing about your long career in education and seeing you in action at Solana Beach, it is obvious that you believe children are the most important work.\u201d\n\nBrentlinger is a San Diego State product and the board brought her back to San Diego from the Ocean View School District in Huntington Beach with her hiring in 2018. She began her career as an elementary and middle school teacher in the Capistrano Unified School District; at Ocean View, she had served as an assistant superintendent for educational services.\n\nBrentlinger was emotional in her remarks and as she ticked off all the lasts in a long career in public education\u2014her last school board meeting, her last read-aloud with students scheduled for the following week, and finally, her last official day: Jan. 2, 2024. Brentlnger, who has been living apart from her husband and family for the last five and half years, is looking forward to being able to spend more time with them. She plans to transition to a completely different way of life than she\u2019s known as the family operates Challis Creek Ranch, a horse boarding facility with equine retirement pastures in Idaho.\n\nIn her 14 years as a senior cabinet member and superintendent, Brentlinger has worked with 11 different school boards and, like King pointed out, she does think that the Solana Beach board was the best.\n\n\u201cNo matter the challenge before you, your north star always remains student wellbeing,\u201d Brentlinger said. \u201cIt has been such a rewarding experience and one I will forever cherish. The incoming superintendent is beyond fortunate to join your governance team.\u201d\n\nLast year Brentlinger spearheaded the crafting of a new mission and vision statement for the district, what President Debra Schade called \u201ca common language about what we do and our aspirations for each student.\u201d The mission states that the district is \u201cWhere learners find their voice, share their strength and advance the world\u201d and its vision is \u201cInspiring wonder and discovery in learning and life.\u201d\n\nThanks to donations, the mission and vision statements have been printed up large and will be hung in all of the schools\u2019 main offices, a small piece of Brentlinger\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cYour shoes are going to be hard to fill,\u201d Schade said. \u201cYou have led with your heart and we are so grateful you chose to share your gifts and talents with us. Happy trails.\u201d\n\nThe district\u2019s search for the one who will fill Brenlinger\u2019s shoes is currently in progress\u2014on Dec, 5, the board approved a leadership profile prepared by search firm Education Support Services (ESS) with input from an online survey and group sessions. ESS also recently placed Superintendent Anne Staffieri in the San Dieguito Union High School District.\n\nThe wish list of characteristics of the new superintendent include \u201can authentic interpersonal style,\u201d a person who can bring employees together in support of the entire district, someone who is accessible, a strategic planner and a leader who can walk into any classroom ready to support students and staff.\n\nFirst interviews of the candidates are expected to be held on Jan. 13.\n\nThe last board meeting of the year was also the time to select board officers for the coming year. At the meeting, Schade put forward a slate that would retain the current officers in the interest of stability. She will remain as president, King will stay as vice president, and Gaylin Allbaugh as clerk.\n\nUnion has made it public that after 12 years serving on the board, 2024 will be her last year: \u201cI want to finish strong,\u201d Union said, adding that she will support the board leadership in any way she can.\n\n"
