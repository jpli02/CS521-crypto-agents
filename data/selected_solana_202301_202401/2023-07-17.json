        "content": "Solana doubled in price since June, and it seems it wants to go much higher.\n\nKey Support levels: $26\n\nKey Resistance levels: $33\n\nUptrend Intact\n\nThe impressive performance by Solana continued in July, and a major breakout took place last Friday when the price moved above $26 and almost reached $33, which is the current resistance. SOL has turned the $26 level into support, and so long as this level holds, this cryptocurrency has a clear path higher.\n\nBuying Volume Exploded\n\nLast week\u2019s buy pressure exceeded any expectation with levels not seen since the start of 2023. This impressive interest from buyers rapidly translated into a higher price. The volume has decreased somewhat compared to last week, but buyers continue to be present.\n\n3. RSI is Overbought\n\nThe daily RSI is giving a clear signal that Solana may have reached a local top right now after hitting 82 points. This means a pullback is likely on lower timeframes, and buyers have to do their best to stop sellers at the key support.\n\nBias\n\nThe bias for SOL is bullish.\n\nShort-Term Prediction for SOL Price\n\nThe price action remains bullish for Solana, and momentum is favoring buyers. Nevertheless, a short-lived pullback could take place before the price attempts to break the key resistance at $33. If, for any reason, the support at $26 fails, then the pullback may last longer than initially expected."

        "title": "Trending Coins You Should Buy for 100x Gains: Solana, Tradecurve, and Aave - Hindustan Times",
        "content": "Solana (SOL), Aave (AAVE), and Tradecurve (TCRV) are the three trending coins that captured the attention of the crypto community. These coins have shown good price movements and can potentially deliver significant returns. These coins' key features and recent developments highlight why they are worth considering for potential 10X gains.\n\nSummary\n\nSolana (SOL) and Coca-Cola collaborate\n\nAave (AAVE) on an upward trend\n\nTradecurve raises $2.8M so far during its presale\n\nSolana (SOL): Scaling to New Heights\n\nSolana (SOL) has gained significant traction in crypto. With its high-performance blockchain infrastructure, Solana aims to address scalability issues that hinder traditional blockchain networks. The project has garnered attention for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees.\n\nUnlock exclusive access to the latest news on India's general elections, only on the HT App. Download Now! Download Now!\n\nRecently, Coca-Cola in Serbia and the Solana NFT platform SolSea announced their cooperation for an NFT issuance during a concert.\n\nAfter this news, Solana surged as its value increased by 23.2% in the last 14 days. Solana has a value of $20.76 with a market cap of $8.3B, which is a drop of 3.94% in the last 24 hours. The coin can potentially deliver substantial gains with continued adoption and developments within the Solana ecosystem.\n\nAave (AAVE): Revolutionizing Decentralized Lending\n\nAave (AAVE), a decentralized lending platform built on Ethereum, has gained popularity due to its innovative approach to borrowing and lending in decentralized finance. The platform Aave enables users to lend or borrow various cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, creating a transparent and efficient lending ecosystem.\n\nIn recent developments, the decision to convert 1,600 ETH, or $3 million, into the wrapped staked ether (wstETH) and rocket pool Ether (ETH) is being voted on by Aave (AAVE) token holders as part of a governance process. Aave could make 3.8% by staking wstETH and 3.13% by staking rETH after the conversion.\n\nThe strong fundamentals and growing adoption within the DeFi sector of Aave have propelled its price upward as it trades hands at $70.47 with a market cap of $1B. As the demand for decentralized lending continues to rise, the potential of Aave for significant gains becomes increasingly evident.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV): Fundamentally Alters the Online Trading Market\n\nOne project currently in its presale phase has also captured attention - Tradecurve (TCRV), providing early investors an 80% return on investment. With over 12,500 users onboarded and $2.8M raised, the interest in Tradecurve is growing daily.\n\nTradecurve introduces a unique trading platform combining the best aspects of decentralized and centralized exchanges. On Tradecurve, all derivatives can be traded from one account, which can be created using an email only (no sign-up KYC requirements).\n\nThis provides a trading environment where users remain anonymous - something millions of traders desire.\n\nFeatures such as a copy trading feature, high leverage starting at 500:1, and more are only some of the aspects that give Tradecurve a competitive edge over platforms like Robinhood.\n\nBehind all these features will be its native token, currently in Stage 4 of its presale, with a value of $0.018. With projections that it may rise by 50x before the presale ends, now is the perfect time to purchase it - so do not miss out.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: This article is a paid publication and does not have journalistic/editorial involvement of Hindustan Times.
