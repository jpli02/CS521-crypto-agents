According to the letter, in November 2022 the firm quickly created a side pocket (a carveout of the main fund) for assets impacted by FTX. This included assets stuck on the exchange, which are now ensnared in bankruptcy proceedings. The side pocket also included Multicoin assets withdrawn from FTX just prior to collapse, which the letter says may be subject to clawbacks by the FTX estate."

Karole Reward Israel, 29, assistant parish priest of St. Vincent Ferrer Parish Convent in Solana, surrendered after receiving the arrest warrant issued on March 1 by Judge Dennis Mendoza of the Regional Trial Court-Branch 4 in this city.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe arrest warrant for Israel was issued for 20 counts of acts of lasciviousness, voyeurism, and rape filed by a 16-year-old student at a private school and a member of the parish youth ministry in Solana.\n\nDuring the National Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (NBI) probe last year, the girl recounted the violations allegedly committed by the priest on her.\n\nLate last year, cases of violation of the anti-sexual harassment, qualified seduction, violence against women and children, anti-photo and video voyeurism, and child abuse were lodged against Israel before the Tuguegarao prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nIsrael was caught in a rescue operation in Barangay Iraga on Oct. 18, 2022, after he allegedly molested the victim again inside his car near the Iraga Elementary School and Iraga Presbyterian Church.\n\nBut he posted a P183,000 bail bond on Oct. 20 for his temporary freedom.\n\nThe NBI said the girl, sent by her parents to the parish to serve God beginning in December 2019, was a parish youth minister serving as lector, commentator, and choir member on Sunday Masses, wedding and funeral Masses, and other Church activities.\n\nThe priest was ordained on May 24, 2021, and was assigned as assistant parish priest of St. Vincent Ferrer in Solana.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey first met inside the convent as the priest was staying there and the girl was a youth minister. They later became close with each other, the NBI report said.\n\nThe priest allegedly first violated the girl on Feb. 8, 2022, inside his car. The girl resisted and eventually escaped, but the abuse escalated on later dates when the priest repeatedly raped the girl in various locations.\n\n\u201cThe same process became a routine, which happened mostly at a motel/hotel, inside the car, and once at the convent. Their latest tryst was on Oct. 15, 2022,\u201d the NBI added.\n\nThe priest allegedly even threatened the girl that he would release the sex videos he had secretly recorded of them if the victim would divulge their trysts.\n\nIsrael could not be reached for comment, and did not issue any media statement.\n\nThe Catholic Archdiocese in Tuguegarao has yet to issue a statement regarding the issue.\n\nYour subscription could not be saved.
