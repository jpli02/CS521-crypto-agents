        "content": "Solana outperforms Tron in various sectors, despite having fewer active addresses.\n\nA booming NFT market and high activity on dApps helped the network\u2019s rise.\n\nTron [TRX] has been exceeding expectations as the number of daily active users continued to surge. This caused the protocol to generate large amounts of revenue.\n\nCheck out the Weekly Fundamentals report from @tokenterminal! \u2705 Token transfers fuel growth\n\n\u2705 Strong adoption in emerging markets Read more about this: https://t.co/vh8kK15L0d pic.twitter.com/qlLfdaEG9e \u2014 TRON DAO (@trondao) May 19, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Tron Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, despite these factors, Solana [SOL] outperformed Tron in various areas.\n\nTron cannot catch up\n\nArtemis\u2019 data showcased that the daily active addresses on the Tron network were high compared to Solana at press time. However, the latter still outperformed Tron in terms of daily transactions by a huge margin.\n\nThis indicated that even though Tron had a large user base, Solana\u2019s users were more engaged with the network. One reason for the same would be the popularity of Solana NFTs. Popular Solana NFT collections, such as Solana Monkey Business and DeGods, have been doing relatively over the last week.\n\nAccording to SolanaFloor\u2019s data, the number of owners holding the Solana Monkey Business collection has grown materially over the last few days. Coupled with that, the floor price of this NFT collection also grew significantly in the same period.\n\nUntil press time, no Tron NFT collection could garner the same level of interest as Solana Blue Chip NFT collections.\n\nThe dApp angle\n\nAnother factor that has aided Solana in retaining such a loyal and engaged user base is because of the dApps on its protocol. One of its dApps, called Raydium, has seen a massive uptick in the number of users on its protocol. Over the last month, the unique active addresses on the protocol surged by a whopping 163.5%.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s Solana\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nSubsequently, the number of transactions being made on the network also grew.\n\nStakers were optimistic about the state of the network as well. Staking Reward\u2019s data indicated that the number of stakers increased by 4.81% in the last month, standing at 621,060 at press time."

        "content": "For Skin Cancer Awareness Month in May, a Solana Beach resident wants to raise awareness about checking for early signs and symptoms.\n\nSolana Beach resident Ryan Labrum, 45, said a routine trip to the dermatologist turned into an early stage melanoma diagnosis. The good news was that doctors expected it to be easily treatable.\n\n\u201cI was very surprised that the spot my dermatologist found to be melanoma was in fact a melanoma,\u201d said Labrum, who works as an architect. \u201cI had no idea. It didn\u2019t look weird, it didn\u2019t look strange, it was just a spot on my face. I think people ought to be cognizant that anything that forms on your skin that might seem a little bit weird, or even if it doesn\u2019t seem weird, it\u2019s good to just have it checked out.\u201d\n\nHe added that the spot on his face looked \u201cunsuspecting\u201d to him before going to the dermatologist.\n\nLast February, the melanoma was removed in surgery by Rancho Santa Fe resident Dr. Hugh Greenway, of Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center, followed by plastic surgery performed by Salvatore Pacella of Scripps Clinic Del Mar.\n\nGrowing up in Utah, Labrum said he got frequent sun exposure while skiing and vacationing in places such as Hawaii and Florida.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty common for us to go to the beach or to go skiing, be outdoors and not really think about it,\u201d he added.\n\nCancer of the skin is the most common type of cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. Melanoma is also 20-times more common in White people than in Black people. The risk increases with age.\n\nOne of the biggest risk factors for melanoma is exposure to ultraviolet light, with sunlight being one of the biggest sources. Tanning beds and sun lamps also emit ultraviolet rays. People who have many moles are also more likely to develop melanoma.\n\nSigns of melanoma include spots on the skin that change in size, shape or color. Other warnings include sores that don\u2019t heal, pigment spreading from the border of a spot to the surrounding skin, and pain or other tenderness on a skin spot.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any real family history of melanoma and I think I grew up a little differently than my parents grew up,\u201d Labrum said, \u201cso my circumstances were probably different from them, but to be aware that even if you don\u2019t have any family history, if you don\u2019t really have any personal concerns about it, it\u2019s always good to go in and have any suspicious spot looked at.\u201d"
