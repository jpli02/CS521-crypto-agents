        "content": "SOLANA BEACH, Calif. (KGTV) \u2014 Crowds gathered at Fletcher Cove Sunday to watch as a large pipe sprayed sand along Solana Beach, with bulldozers spreading it around. This beach restoration project aims to combat years of erosion caused by storms and high tides.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great. It needed to happen,\" said Eric Richey, an Encinitas resident. \"There has not been much beach for the locals or the tourists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is to protect public safety, but also public infrastructure,\u201d said Mayor Lesa Heebner of Solana Beach.\n\nBoth Solana Beach and Encinitas have secured $32 million in federal funding to replenish their shores. \u201cBecause of upstream development, we don\u2019t have the normal natural sources of sand to nourish our beaches with more and more sand,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Heebner, crews will be working at Solana Beach for the next 45 to 60 days, transporting sand from the San Dieguito Lagoon to cover the entire length of the beach. Then the same replenishment efforts will extend to Encinitas.\n\nUpon completion, the shoreline is expected to double in size, reaching 150 feet, Heebner said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to spend a lot more time here, that\u2019s for sure,\" Richey said. \"There will be a lot more room for people. It was pretty crowded this summer.\u201d\n\nThis beach replenishment initiative is part of a broader 50-year project to maintain the coastline. Crews will revisit Solana Beach every ten years and Encinitas every five years.\n\nWhile the construction at Fletcher Cove draws attention, the active site will be secured with barricades to ensure public safety. The project's next phase is set to progress northward to Cardiff."

        "content": "Solana and Sui take in Ethereum outflow.\n\nSUI and SOL have seen declines but flash different RSI signals.\n\nSolana [SOL] and Sui [SUI] have experienced significant inflows from Ethereum [ETH] over the past month, according to data from Wormhole. However, it raises the question of whether this has influenced the overall transaction volume on these networks.\n\nSui and Solana take in the Ethereum flow\n\nWormhole data showed that around $370 million in liquidity shifted away from Ethereum in the last month. Sui and Solana accounted for about 90% of this outflow.\n\nPresently, these two networks continue to dominate, with an Ethereum outflow totaling over $106.2 million. Sui received around $68 million, while Solana received approximately $27 million, making up a combined 89% of the outflow from Ethereum.\n\nAnalyzing the Sui and Solana volume\n\nA recent analysis of Sui\u2019s volume on DefiLlama showed a significant uptick in the past few days. Examining the chart reveals that the volume witnessed in January surpassed that of the preceding three months.\n\nThe upward trend peaked on 13th January, reaching over 76 million, marking the highest point in months. As of this writing, the volume was around 44 million.\n\nNotably, Sui\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL), despite a recent dip from around $344 million to $322 million, remained at its historically highest level.\n\nConversely, Solana has experienced a shift in volume trends. While the network\u2019s volume increased towards the end of the year, it has witnessed a recent decline. Presently, the volume is over $740 million, reflecting a decrease but still outpacing Sui\u2019s volume.\n\nSOL and SUI post different price trends\n\nAnalyzing the daily price trend of Sui showed an uptrend that peaked around 15th January, reaching around $1.3 with a notable 9% increase.\n\nDuring this rise, the price entered the overbought zone, as evidenced by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). After this peak, the price experienced declines, causing the RSI to dip below 60.\n\nAt present, the price has decreased by nearly 5%, trading at around $1.1.\n\nRead Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nIn contrast, Solana has dipped below the neutral line on its RSI, reflecting a decline in the price over the past three days.\n\nAs of this writing, SOL was trading at around $92, marking a decrease of over 1% in its price."

        "title": "Aave V3 Ready For Solana After This Crucial Vote Passed - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Aave community has overwhelmingly approved a proposal that will set the ball rolling for deploying Aave V3 on Solana, a smart contracts platform. The motion, put forward by the Neon Foundation and the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI), passed with a majority vote of 83% based on results posted on January 21.\n\nSolana Fast Rising, DeFi Ecosystem Active\n\nSolana has been rapidly expanding, with its native currency, SOL, emerging as one of the top performers in 2023. To put it in perspective, SOL prices exploded from about $10 in 2023 to around $125 by the end of the year.\n\nThis surge saw SOL reverse losses of November 2022 while concurrently catalyzing events on the blockchain, spurring various activities, including the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT), and meme coin activities.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin Price Turns Red, Why BTC Could Tumble Below $40K\n\nOn the other hand, Aave has been expanding to multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks, emerging as one of the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. According to on-chain data from DeFiLlama on January 22, Aave manages over $6.9 billion worth of assets across ten chains. A big chunk, over 90%, comprises assets on Ethereum. Aave v3 has a total value locked (TVL) of $4.9 billion.\n\nAave V3 On Solana, What It Means\n\nThe TEMP CHECK proposers are keen on Aave v3 deploying on Solana, considering the blockchain\u2019s rapid growth in the past year. They observe that the blockchain\u2019s DeFi TVL and broad user base would likely benefit the lending and borrowing protocol, cementing its position as a market leader.\n\nIf Aave is deployed on Solana, the protocol will access the deep liquidity on the blockchain. At the same time, users will access Aave services more conveniently. Subsequently, the proposers reiterated this move will cement Aave\u2019s position as the leading liquidity market on-chain. Moreover, it will likely open up new opportunities for collaboration between the Aave, Solana, and other Neon EVM communities.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nXRP Crash Fears Mount As Whale Dumps 26 Million Tokens \u2013 Details 4 months ago\n\nNeon EVM is a cross-chain bridge for users to transfer assets between Ethereum and other blockchains. Through this bridge, Aave v3 will go live on Solana without any major reconfiguration of the protocol\u2019s codebase. Among the tokens that will be initially supported is SOL. Users will be free to borrow USDC, a stablecoin.\n\nThe passing of the TEMP CHECK also reflects Aave\u2019s ambition to expand across multiple blockchains beyond EVM networks. So far, Aave has been deployed on various platforms, including layer-2s like Arbitrum and Base, Avalanche, and Ethereum\u2019s sidechain, Polygon.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
