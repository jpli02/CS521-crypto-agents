        "content": "SAN DIEGO (KGTV) \u2014 Tara Farrokhi remembers crying on Jan. 8, 2020, after learning 176 people were killed after Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752 (PS752) was shot down.\n\n\"It was really intense,\" said Farrokhi, as she and other advocates clutched signs outside of San Diego's Hall of Justice on Sunday, protesting the Iranian Regime.\n\nIran claimed its military unintentionally shot down PS752, mistaking it for a hostile flight.\n\nThree years to the date, those advocating for Iranian's human rights do not believe that claim.\n\n\"So far there has not been any progress, even with this case,\" said Armin, another protester, referring to the plane crash.\n\nIn North County, hundreds walked along the coast of Solana Beach as a memorial was created in the sand in honor of the 176 lives lost in 2020.\n\nAdvocates say they helped organize the large protest, hoping to remind Americans of violence happening overseas in both Iran and Ukraine.\n\n\"You don\u2019t have to be Ukrainian. You don\u2019t have to be Iranian to stand for them. If you care for humanity, you\u2019re on our side,\" said Tomer Eilam, the sand artist creating the silhouette of a plane inside of a heart on Solana Beach.\n\nPublic executions and violence are continuing in Iran amid protests for human rights.\n\n\"People in Iran, the young kids, the young children, the young women are stepping forward, are sacrificing their blood. They are dying and painting freedom with their blood, with their heart,\" said Armin.\n\nAdvocates encourage anyone interested in learning more about changes they want to see in Iran, visit actionforiran.com"

        "content": "A new meme coin based on the Solana (SOL) blockchain is immensely outpacing its established rivals Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) to open the year.\n\nBonk (BONK) is starting 2023 with a bang after posting astronomical gains in the first few days of 2023 despite the persistent crypto bear winter.\n\nThe new meme token opened the year at $0.0000002 and surged as high as $0.000004 on January 5th, marking gains of 1,900% in less than one week. The Shiba Inu and Dogecoin rival has given up some of its gains since and is trading at $0.000002 at time of writing. Despite the correction, BONK remains up 900% in about a week.\n\nMeanwhile, BONK\u2019s competitors are starting the year on a sluggish note. Leading meme coin DOGE is up 1.43% over the same timeframe, from $0.07 on January 1st to $0.071 at time of writing. Ethereum-based altcoin Shiba Inu is faring better than DOGE after rising 3.75% from $0.000008 on January 1st to $0.0000083 at time of writing.\n\nAmid Bonk\u2019s meteorical ascent last week, the developers behind the altcoin reveal that they have torched $10 million worth of BONK tokens.\n\n\u201cBONK represents the best of Solana. Our community is working together across the ecosystem to make positive change for all of us.\n\nThe five trillion BONK tokens allocated to \u2018The Team\u2019 have been burned.\u201d\n\nSolana explorer Solscan shows that BONK\u2019s current supply has shrunk to 94.12 trillion tokens.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
