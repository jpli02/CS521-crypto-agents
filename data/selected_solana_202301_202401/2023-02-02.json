        "title": "Can Solana stay afloat without SBF and FTX? - Protos",
        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nSolana is widely regarded as the personal project of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). He single-handedly set a floor price of $3 before one of the most spectacular bull runs in crypto history to $267.\n\nSBF now faces decades to life in prison.\n\nSBF-connected insiders purchased hundreds of millions of SOL below $0.26. As far back as April 2018, Solana\u2019s founders sold 15% of SOL\u2019s initial supply to private investors at $0.04. These rounds excluded public investors, of course, who had to wait to purchase SOL when it began trading on exchanges north of $2.80 on August 11, 2020.\n\nI'll buy as much SOL has you have, right now, at $3.\n\n\n\nSell me all you want.\n\n\n\nThen go fuck off. \u2014 SBF (@SBF_FTX) January 9, 2021\n\nRead more: Jump Crypto forced to save Solana with $320M bailout of its own company\n\nSBF believed he was so rich by January 2021 that he offered to buy an unlimited quantity of SOL at $3. For a few months, that bet appeared brilliant; within 11 months, SOL hit an all-time high of $267.\n\nFTX took over $600 million worth of SOL into bankruptcy.\n\nDuring the week when FTX declared bankruptcy, the price of SOL declined 60%.\n\nToday \u2014 even after doubling last month \u2014 SOL still trades 90% lower than its peak.\n\nSBF is now under house arrest and many of his colleagues turned state\u2019s evidence. With SBF\u2019s fraudulent empire in bankruptcy, famously centralized Solana has had to find other ways to remake itself.\n\nSolana\u2019s insiders turned off their blockchain entirely at least a dozen times in 2022. Now, its goals are more rudimentary: keep the blockchain running.\n\nPositive headlines for Solana post-SBF\n\nLast week, Solana announced that its dApp Store will be integrated with its mobile phone, Saga.\n\nJump Crypto President Kanav Kariya confirmed plans to build an open-source validator client called Firedancer on Solana and optimize it for high-frequency trading.\n\nKin \u2014 previously charged by the SEC \u2014 released a middleware development platform, Kinetic, on the Solana platform.\n\nSolana-supporting Phantom wallet says it thwarted more than 18,000 attacks and blocked a malicious website that stole NFTs from tech entrepreneur Kevin Rose.\n\nMarinade Finance announced plans to increase total value locked (TVL) by 40 million SOL on January 24, through an incentive tied to its native staking token, mSOL.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t only been smooth sailing\n\nOn January 26, Solana-based DeFi app Friktion announced a sunset of its platform and urged users to withdraw their assets.\n\nDecentralized gaming marketplace Fractal showed signs of moving away from Solana-based assets and emphasized support for a Solana competitor, Polygon, on January 24.\n\nSolana\u2019s Remote Procedure Call endpoints went down on January 8 due to a Solana Validator client error, whose endpoints enable apps to connect to Solana\u2019s blockchain.\n\nFor more informed news, follow us on Twitter and Google News or subscribe to our YouTube channel."

        "title": "Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin nears $24,000; Avalanche, Polygon Solana rally up to 14% - Business Today",
        "content": "Bitcoin and other major crypto tokens were rallying sharply on Thursday, with some posting double digit gains after the in-line US Fed rate hikes and dovish commentary from the US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. He acknowledged that the rally in the gold prices has eased down mildly.\n\nInvestors seemed more interested in Powell's comments that the US central bank's inflation fight was far from over than his remark. The Fed is still looking to slash inflation to 2 per cent from its most recent 6.5 per cent level in December.\n\nBitcoin extended its gains and marched towards $24,000-mark, thanks to a buoyancy. Its largest peer Ethereum topped $1,600 and was eyeing $1,700-level after a sharp recovery. However, a few altcoins outperformed the crypto bluechips as Optimism Synthetix, and Loopring rallied 18-22 per cent each.\n\nThe crypto market has been higher today. This could likely be because of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hike of 0.25 per cent Bitcoin breached the key level of $24,000 and fell marginally, said ZebPay Trade Desk.\n\n\"As for the Indian economy, whose Budget was presented today, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman made no mention of crypto, virtual or digital assets, blockchain or central bank digital currencies,\" it added. \"India has been keeping cool on a crypto bill since early last year, stating that crypto regulation cannot succeed without global coordination, something that is a priority with its power to lead the G-20.\"\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading sharply higher on Thursday, cheering the lesser aggressive US Fed. Avalanched soared about 14 per cent, whereas Polygon was up 11 per cent. Solana and Ethereum gained 6 per cent each during the early trade.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher at $1.09 trillion mark, rising about 4 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes jumped 32 per cent close to $61.61 billion.\n\nCrypto updates\n\nMeta Platforms continued to lose massive amounts of money in its fledgling Facebook Reality Labs division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations, according to its earnings release.\n\nBinance\u2019s blockchain network BNB Chain released on Wednesday morning the white paper for BNB Greenfield, a new decentralized data storage system that will round out Binance\u2019s existing decentralized network.\n\nTech View by Trade Dest WazirX\n\ndYdX is a leading decentralized exchange that currently supports perpetual trading. dYdX runs on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, and allows users to trade with no intermediaries. dYdX is a smallcap crypto project trading at 94th rank with half a billion marketcap.\n\nThe DYDX coin gained more than 100 per cent in the last 7 days compared to Bitcoin, which rose by over 2 per cent in the same period. As per the chart DYDX is currently trading above the 21-week MA and it has also broken a flat consolidation pattern with good volumes on weekly timeframe. It is an indication of potential trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend.\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Crypto wireless network Helium was once the poster child for tangible crypto utility\u2014but growing skepticism of the model, plus major brands distancing themselves from the project, has cast doubt on whether the distributed network is actually serving much purpose.\n\nNova Labs, which created and now supports the decentralized Helium network, now has a plan to bring more high-profile brands and large companies into the fray. The company calls it \"1663\"\u2014a new integration arm to help large-scale enterprises develop and deploy projects and products built around Helium\u2019s original internet of things (IoT) network.\n\nAmir Haleem, Nova Labs CEO and Helium co-founder, described 1663 as a necessary next step for the backers of an open-source network that has grown in scale over the last two years, but still presents challenges for adoption by established companies that may doubt its effectiveness or its token-based model.\n\nHelium Founder Explains Why the Crypto Wireless Network Is Moving to Solana\n\n\u201cNow that Helium has gotten to that maturity point where it is extremely stable and reliable,\u201d he told Decrypt, \u201cI think what's needed now is an entity to exist to help shepherd those high-value applications from concept to reality.\u201d\n\n1663 is designed to handle complete project solutions for companies that can use Helium\u2019s low-power, wide area network for sensors and trackers from IoT devices.

Haleem said the division is targeting more \u201chigh value\u201d and \u201cbrand name\u201d firms.\n\nGrowing scrutiny\n\nHelium and its founders have faced increasing scrutiny as the network gained prominence.\n\nLast August, the Helium website removed the logos of scooter rideshare startup Lime and cloud software giant Salesforce after both denied being linked to the network. Nova said at the time that many companies have tested Helium integration at some stage, but promised a \u201cmuch more rigorous\u201d process for vetting claimed partners for marketing materials.\n\nHelium Pledges \u2018Much More Rigorous\u2019 Process After Salesforce, Lime Deny Partnerships\n\nThe network has also taken flak for what appears to be low usage, generating less than $2,000 per month worth of data credits for network usage fees from August through October last year, per data from the Helium Foundation. Haleem wrote in August 2022 that Helium generates revenue through other means, as well, and claimed some $54 million worth in total as of then.\n\nMeanwhile, miners\u2014who purchased hardware nodes to share their internet access and expand the network\u2014have seen shrinking crypto token rewards as Helium scaled.

That doesn\u2019t gel with many crypto traders\u2019 desire for rapid gains and rewards. 1663 wasn\u2019t created specifically as a response to such complaints, he said, but if successful it could help Helium gain greater traction among traditional Web2 companies.\n\nEven with relatively low network revenue generated by data credits\u2014up to nearly $15,000 in January, per the Helium Foundation\u2014and what he acknowledged is an \u201copen\u201d question about network economics, he said the most important stat in his view is how much data is being transmitted on the network.\n\nHelium handled nearly 1.5 billion packets (or messages) of data in January, the Foundation said, up more than 10 times from about 121 million messages in September 2022. In a statement shared with Decrypt, Helium Foundation CEO Abhay Kumar said that it\u2019s not possible to determine the exact sources of traffic on a permissionless network.\n\n5G and beyond\n\nHelium's 5G network for smartphones and other devices is today growing more gradually than the IoT network did at its peak, with about 8,300 hotspots deployed over the past several months\u2014but Nova Labs says it's key to its future plans.\n\nThe network will provide the backbone for Nova\u2019s upcoming Helium Mobile wireless service, which pairs Helium\u2019s user-supported network with nationwide 5G coverage from major carrier T-Mobile\u2014and lets users earn crypto tokens by using the service.\n\nCrypto Wireless Carrier Helium Mobile Will Power Solana\u2019s Saga Smartphone\n\nIn response to reports that Helium 5G-compatible hotspots aren\u2019t actually serving up true 5G service, Haleem acknowledged that the branding was \u201cpart of a future-looking strategy,\u201d and that the network can support 5G devices. He pointed to at least one upcoming hotspot with a 5G NR radio onboard, but also defended the branding as business as usual for a wireless industry that has used misleading labels in the past.\n\n\u201cIt's a little bit of a mess, and that's just kind of the way this industry is,\u201d he said of cellular standard branding. \u201cHelium is in there representing the 5G network, I think, consistently with the way others are.\u201d\n\nHelium Founders, T-Mobile Launch Crypto-Powered 5G Mobile Service\n\nHelium is also in the process of migrating from its own blockchain to Solana following last fall\u2019s community vote, and Helium Mobile will integrate with the Solana Saga smartphone.
