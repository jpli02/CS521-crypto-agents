        "title": "Crypto news: Solana, Pepe and Crypto.com - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "How are the Solana (SOL), Pepe (PEPE) and Crypto.com (CRO) coins performing on the crypto market? Below is an analysis of their prices and the latest news.\n\nAnalysis of Solana (SOL), Pepe (PEPE) and Crypto.com (CRO) cryptos\n\nRecall that Solana, whose native crypto is SOL, is a public, open-source and decentralised blockchain platform that achieves consensus using a proof-of-stake algorithm along with a novel algorithm called proof-of-history.\n\nPepe Coin (PEPE), on the other hand, is one of the new meme cryptocurrencies to hit the market and is named after the famous character Pepe the Frog.\n\nFinally, Crypto.com, whose native crypto is CRO, is a Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange company.\n\nFocus on the price of the Solana crypto: a comparison with Pepe and Crypto.com\n\nThe price of SOL is currently in an uptrend, having made a low of $16. Specifically, the uptrend for SOL started at the beginning of 2023, when the price rose from a low of $8 to a high of $27.\n\nHowever, the move was corrected by the bears and the price fell by around 41%. Solana then began to form an ascending channel with higher and higher highs and lows.\n\nHowever, the price action favours the bulls and it can be said that the $20 support is holding the price firmly in place. Solana\u2019s volume has also increased recently.\n\nSolana has also seen an increase in the total locked-in value due to the increase in DEX volume. After testing the highs of $26 on the 17th of April, the price of Solana has fallen by approximately 16.08% since then.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily price chart of Solana (SOL/USDT)\n\nSolana\u2019s price also received a rejection from the 200-day EMA as it reached the $26 level, and the 20.50 and 100-day EMAs go hand in hand with the price.\n\nFinally, we see that payments giant Mastercard has recently agreed to work with Solana to create a shared infrastructure to enable reliable transactions between wallets and promote compliance with regulatory requirements, including the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s travel rule.\n\nCan Pepe (PEPE) go up more than 130%?\n\nAs we know, PEPE, the new crypto meme, has become popular after rising 1,500% in two weeks.\n\nMoreover, the coin has entered the top 50 most expensive cryptocurrencies after its market value surpassed $1 billion in just a few weeks.\n\nAs such, analysts are expecting a race to the top for the meme coin if this trend continues.\n\nSpecifically, according to a widely followed crypto strategist known as Kaleo, Pepe could see significant growth if it follows the pattern of a technology stock that exploded during the Covid pandemic.\n\nKaleo took to Twitter to share his analysis, stating that Pepe\u2019s recent market activity is similar to the price action of Zoom (ZM) in the early 2020s, when the tech stock soared more than 800% in less than 12 months.\n\nHe also pointed out that Zoom traded below diagonal resistance before its meteoric rise, and Pepe\u2019s current market structure looks strikingly similar in the lower timeframe.\n\nIndeed, Pepe has broken the previous diagonal barrier and is now trading at all-time highs. Kaleo estimates that it has room to rise before reaching $0.000007, the point at which it is likely to reverse course.\n\nPepe\u2019s current value is around $0.00000296, so if it reaches Kaleo\u2019s target price, it will rise by more than 130%. We just have to wait and see what happens.\n\nPartnership between Crypto.come and Altura\n\nRecently, Altura announced a strategic alliance with Crypto.com (Cronos) that will allow game developers to use Altura\u2019s SDK and API to create cutting-edge Web3 games on the Cronos chain.\n\nIn addition, Altura\u2019s intuitive NFT marketplace will act as a catalyst for mass appeal. As a result, innovative games launched on the Cronos chain will be able to reach a wider audience.\n\nIn addition, by using Altura\u2019s APIs and SDKs, game developers can avoid Web3\u2019s technical challenges, such as Solidity and blockchain node management.\n\nThe collaboration aims to shorten the development lifecycle by making it easier for developers to create, scale and monetise Web3 games."

        "content": "In the mid-aughts, Anatoly Yakovenko, a cofounder of the blockchain Solana, imagined a future where he could wield a handheld computer. Little did he know that, three years later, Apple would release the first iPhone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, right, how fast that can happen?\u201d Yakovenko, wearing a black T-shirt and baseball cap, said to a rapt audience in New York City last June. But, he added, \u201cThat can happen in crypto.\u201d\n\nArguing that \u201cit\u2019s time for crypto to go mobile,\u201d he announced that he and his team were developing the \u201cSaga,\u201d a Web3 smartphone slated to come out in 2023. As of Monday, the phone is finally available for the wider public.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first crypto smartphone to hit the market. Will it help \u201conboard the next billion users,\u201d a refrain Web3 enthusiasts use when talking about how to best evangelize crypto? Or is it a niche offering best reserved for diehard crypto fans? Fortune spent five days with the Saga. Here\u2019s what we thought.\n\nTechnically speaking\n\nAt its core, the Saga, which retails for $1,000, is a sleek Android smartphone.\n\nIts technical specifications rival that of other phones in the same price tier. Built by OSOM, a smartphone startup, it comes with 512 gigabytes of memory, 12 gigabytes of RAM, and a Snapdragon 8+ Gen1 processor.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Saga was responsive, quick, and it felt seamless to jump between different applications. The photos came out well, and the battery life lasted longer than a day. Compared with a basic 2019 Android smartphone used by Fortune reporter Ben Weiss, it was light years ahead.\n\nThat being said, its specifications don\u2019t fully measure up to other phones near the $1,000 range. Google\u2019s flagship model, Pixel Pro, retails at $1,099 for 512 gigabytes of memory. It has the same amount of RAM as the Saga, but the screen has a higher resolution, and its camera has an additional ultra-wide and telephoto lens compared with Saga\u2019s dual-lense ultra-wide lens.\n\nFor the layuser, though, the Saga is a more-than-powerful-enough phone that can take quality photos and provide a similar experience (often at a lower price point) to top devices on the market.\n\nSeed phrase security\n\nBut the Saga isn\u2019t just a premium smartphone. Its selling point is that it\u2019s a Web3 smartphone.\n\nBaked into each and every device is the Seed Vault, what Yakovenko calls a secure way to store seed phrases, or master passwords, to crypto wallets. The seed phrase lives outside the phone\u2019s Android operating system, according to Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs. Any application that prompts a user to authorize a transaction needs to go through gated software.\n\nThis boils down to a complicated setup process that includes fingerprint scanning, a pin code, and a prompt to manually write down the 24-word seed phrase on a piece of paper included within the phone\u2019s packaging. For newcomers to Web3, it\u2019s confusing, but for those with tens of thousands of dollars in crypto, the security is probably worth it.\n\nThe other major selling point of the Saga is its decentralized application marketplace, or dApp store, which Yakovenko has positioned as an eventual competitor to Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s. As opposed to the tech behemoths, Solana Mobile says that it doesn\u2019t take a cut of developers\u2019 sales.\n\nSolana\u2019s dApp store doesn\u2019t take a commission on apps sold on its marketplace, says Yakovenko. Ben Weiss\u2014Fortune\n\nWhen Fortune tested the smartphone, there were 21 dApps for download, with more on the way, says Yakovenko. We were able to mint an NFT of a selfie, play a racing game, and send NFT stickers to the founder of Dialect, a Web3 messaging app. It\u2019s one of the more seamless Web3 experiences out there. However, it wasn\u2019t without its bugs, something other outlets have also documented. (Yakovenko said he and his team are \u201cmoving as fast\u201d as they can to resolve them.) Alpha League Racing, the racing game, would open only sporadically, and at one point when the phone connected to a new WiFi network, the dApp store was unusable.\n\n\u201cThis particular bug is a known edge case impacting a very small number of Saga users with certain WiFi router models,\u201d said a spokesperson for Solana Mobile. \u201cWhile we have identified temporary remediation steps, we have been working on a permanent fix.\u201d\n\nUltimately, for those who live and breathe crypto, the phone allows them to further integrate Web3 into their every day. But for crypto newcomers, the complicated setup process and bugs make the phone\u2019s Web3 features intimidating.\n\n\u2018Shooting in the middle\u2019\n\nYakovenko is clear that, at least at first, the target market for the Saga isn\u2019t the average smartphone user. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be really hard to get to hundreds of millions, tens of millions of users,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cIf we can show traction with ten, twenty thousand users, that\u2019s enough of a distribution channel.\u201d\n\nHowever, the very fact that Solana Labs has invested in a smartphone\u2014a piece of general consumer tech\u2014implies that there\u2019s a vision to sell Web3 to the crypto-naive. And some observers are dubious of its general appeal.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not differentiated by anything else than this very niche feature set that\u2019s unique to already being a crypto nerd, then I\u2019m very skeptical that this would be a way to get people to start using it,\u201d Hubert Palan, the founder and CEO of Productboard, which makes software for product developers, told Fortune.\n\nPhillip Shoemaker, who used to work on Apple\u2019s app store and is now the executive director of the Web3 nonprofit Identity.com, is similarly skeptical. The Saga\u2019s features aren\u2019t fully a hit for either crypto enthusiasts or laypeople, he said. The smartphone currently only supports Solana, not other blockchains. (Yakovenko says there are plans to make other blockchains compatible with the Saga.) And it doesn\u2019t have the bells and whistles of other premium smartphones on the market. \u201cRight now, they\u2019re just shooting in the middle,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nAnthony Georgiades, a general partner at technology fund Innovating Capital, is more optimistic. The security features of the phone, including the Seed Vault, make it similar to a hardware wallet but with more capabilities thanks to the dApp store and its use as a phone, he said. That, plus the association with the Solana brand name, makes him believe it has a chance to succeed with Web3 natives, although he has doubts about broader adoption. \u201cIt enables you to interact with the Solana ecosystem directly, in a secure and trustless way, but to also create wallets and store keys in a very seamless, intuitive way,\u201d Georgiades told Fortune.\n\nThe appeal to a smaller market forms the foundation of Yakovenko\u2019s plan for the Saga, which he has previously called a \u201cmoonshot.\u201d Whether through rave reviews of the smartphone or the emergence of a popular crypto application, he hopes more and more everyday consumers flock to his product. And perhaps it\u2019s the latter\u2014a \u201ckiller\u201d app that convinces the next billion users to switch over to Web3\u2014that will finally tilt the balance.\n\n\u201cEither one of these attempts succeeds,\u201d Yakovenko concluded in an interview with Fortune, \u201cor crypto as a whole industry just never breaks out into the general consumer public.\u201d"
