        "title": "Rally Alert: Solana Dog Token BONK Leads Dog Coins Surge \u2014 Will The Rally Peak Further? - Benzinga",
        "content": "Dog-themed cryptocurrencies, or dog coins, are currently outperforming the broader crypto market. The list includes Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Floki FLOKI/USD, Solana-native dog coin Bonk BONKI/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD.\n\nWhat Happened: A quick snapshot of the dog coins, market caps and the past month's gains (below) also highlighted the past 24-hour trading volumes. Bonki had seen a significant 1,441% rally which was ahead of all the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap, which on average have gained 40%, as reported by Blockworks.\n\nA possible reason for BONK to surge could be Solana\u2019s SOL/USD outperformance in the recent bullish run of the crypto market.\n\nLast Christmas, BONK launched when creators airdropped half of its supply to certain Solana users. BONK was on the constant run to find growth by securing the maximum integrations possible across DeFi, gambling apps and wallets.\n\nWhy It Matters: Dogecoin millionaire Glauber Contessoto announced last week that he planned to make conviction plays on 10 additional altcoin projects for the next crypto bull run. With full belief in Dogecoin's potential, he included meme coin projects such as Pepe Coin PEPE/USD.\n\nHarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, LUKSO LUKSO/USD, KASPA KAS/USD and Avalanche AVAX/USD are also a part of the list.\n\nNotably, Floki announced on its official blog it had a strategic marketing partnership with two legendary Indian cricket teams. This step will lead the token into the mainstream in India and South Asia, thereby touching the global space.\n\nShiba Inu announced a partnership with boxing star and politician Manny Pacquiao wherein the token will be used to optimize fundraising, distribution and other operations.\n\nWhale Movement: On Nov.16, 2023, a Dogecoin whale transferred more than 103 million Dogecoin from the trading platform Robinhood. Also, a significant transfer of 690 million Dogecoin was seen between unknown wallets.\n\nRecent news about sending physical Dogecoin tokens to the moon in December generated significant interest among Dogecoin enthusiasts and investors. It is a project by space payload transporter Astrobotic.\n\nPhotos: Shutterstock, Bonk site"

        "title": "Solana denies 'security threat' to Saga phones following CertiK video - Blockworks",
        "content": "CertiK, on Wednesday, claimed that it found a vulnerability with the Solana Saga phone.\n\nSaga is an Android device \u2014 the first being offered by Solana.\n\nThe auditor said in a post on X that the phone has a bootloader vulnerability. Essentially, a backdoor can supposedly be installed on the phone allowing the initial software responsible for the starting of the device to be compromised.\n\n\u201cThe boot loader is unlocked and software integrity cannot be guaranteed. Any data stored on the device may be available to attackers, Do not store any sensitive data on the device,\u201d a screengrab from CertiK\u2019s accompanying video shows the Solana phone\u2019s screen following the backdoor install.\n\nThe message is an indication that the phone has been hacked, CertiK said. However, it\u2019s not clear if the vulnerability is unique to Saga or if it could impact other Android devices. CertiK did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIn an email to Blockworks, Steven Laver, lead software engineer of mobile at Solana Labs said that \u201cthe CertiK video does not reveal any known vulnerability or security threat to Saga holders. The video shows the user unlocking the bootloader, which is something that can be done on many Android devices.\u201d\n\nAndroid\u2019s own documentation from its Open Source Project outlines the ability to lock and unlock the bootloader.\n\n\u201cUnlocking the bootloader is an advanced feature of Saga, and is disabled by default. We believe in allowing users the choice of how they use their phone, however, unlocking the bootloader is not a security vulnerability \u2013 a user must explicitly allow such changes to be made to their device, and those changes can only be made by an authorized user of the phone,\u201d Laver continued.\n\nHowever, if a user or attacker proceeds to unlock the bootloader, then they not only go through multiple warnings, but their device is wiped \u2014 along with their private keys.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not a process that can take place without users\u2019 active participation or awareness,\u201d Laver said.\n\nCertiK, however, said that only being able to unlock the bootloader with user participation \u201cdoes not eliminate all potential threats.\u201d\n\n\u201cMalicious actors can purchase Saga phones and install backdoors through such \u2018feature,\u2019 and deliver devices to unconscious users. If users did not understand the warnings, they would be tricked and lose funds to attackers,\u201d CertiK said in an email to Blockworks.\n\n\u201cIn addition, given the fact that a considerable portion of traditional phone users have taken the initiative to jailbreak or unlock their devices in the past, it is also likely that some Saga phone users will also explore this \u201cfeature\u201d but without enough security awareness. That\u2019s why we warn users about such situations in our video.\u201d\n\nThe video then proceeds to show how an attacker could drain bitcoin from the wallet attached to the phone. It did not show Seed Vault being used in the video, which protects both supported digital assets and seeds.\n\nSeed Vault was announced in June 2022, and \u201caccesses the highest privileged security environment available on a device, from secure operating modes of the processor to dedicated Secure Elements, which enables a secure transaction signing experience through UI components built into Android.\u201d\n\nSaga was released in April, having been designed to pair Web3 with smartphones. Alongside traditional app stores, Solana offers a separate app store.\n\nThe phone is designed to allow users to have \u201cself-custody of their assets\u201d to make them \u201cfeel comfortable bringing those assets with them on the go,\u201d Laver told Blockworks when the phone was released.\n\nMonths after the launch, the price of Saga was reduced to $599 from $1,000 \u2014 a 40% cut.\n\nAt the time, Emmett Hollyer, head of business operations for Solana Mobile, told Blockworks that the price reduction is \u201ccommon practice in the consumer electronics business, particularly with smartphones.\u201d\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the vulnerability has not impacted SOL \u2014 Solana\u2019s native crypto \u2014 at the time of publishing. In fact, it\u2019s up more than 13% over the past day.\n\nUpdated Friday, Nov. 17 at 12:15 pm ET: Added comment from CertiK.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Pullback Predicted for Solana (SOL); This Rising AI Crypto Becomes The New Go-To for Retail Investors - Markets Insider",
        "content": "Investors are quickly discouraged when a cryptocurrency on the decentralized cryptocurrency list loses its trajectory, as has happened with Solana (SOL).\n\n\u2014\n\nThe project has maintained a bullish trend for the past month but is now experiencing a negative turn. FTX Derivatives Exchange declared bankruptcy late last year and has begun selling off its Solana holdings. Many investors wonder whether the token will pull back and turn downward.\n\nTo remain safe, retail investors have turned to InQubeta (QUBE), a rising AI cryptocurrency with the potential to transform their portfolios with immense returns. The project propels the growth of the AI industry by making provisions for fractionated investments in AI tech startups set up on the blockchain. These investments are minted into trending NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and traded on the platform\u2019s NFT marketplace. This article explores InQubeta\u2019s rise as the go-to investment option for retail investors while delving into Solana\u2019s path to discover the possibilities of a pullback.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Crowdfunding On The Blockchain\n\nInQubeta has been on an upward trend since it first launched its presale, attracting investors with its low entry price and impressive features. The blockchain ICO has recorded the sale of over 495 million QUBE tokens, raising over $4.8 million. Retail investors are currently acquiring tokens in its fifth stage, aiming to earn substantial returns when the tokens are listed. With a DeFi coin price of $0.0161, QUBE has the potential to rise by almost 100% when it lists at a proposed price of $0.0308.\n\nThe current stage of the presale has nearly sold out, with only about 20% left to be purchased. Upon completion, the project would enter the sixth stage and sell at a DeFi coin price of $0.01925 apiece. Holders can further stake their tokens in a protocol that rewards them with a percentage of pooled buy-and-sell tax funds. InQubeta adds more functionality to its platform, making it user-centric by giving holders governance rights. They can vote on projects and decisions to propel the token to greater heights on the decentralized cryptocurrency list.\n\nThis blockchain ICO stands out with features that showcase the power of decentralized finance. Holders can invest regardless of their budgets because investment options are minted into fractionated smart contracts. This revolutionary approach also favors the AI industry, allowing startups to grow and realize their missions through crowdfunding. Investors get rewarded with added utility as these startups begin to grow and turn a profit. The trending NFTs can be traded in the marketplace, allowing investors to shift their focus to other startups as they please.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nSolana (SOL): Rising Amid Liquidation\n\nSolana is one of the fastest-growing crypto coins, with a market capitalization of over $22 billion, putting it in seventh place on the decentralized cryptocurrency list. Over the past month, this open-source DeFi project has witnessed an impressive growth trajectory, rising by over 170%, according to on-chain analysis. This incredible path has ground to a halt with a predicted pullback as the bankrupt FTX Exchange sells off its SOL holdings.\n\nThe exchange transferred 250,000 Solana tokens worth nearly $14 million to Kraken. This sudden move caused a dip in the token\u2019s market value, causing it to fall by about 8%. Investors are skeptical about the possibility of a significant downturn in the token\u2019s bullish trend, and there is still hope that it will recover. According to on-chain analysis from Lookonchain, FTX\u2019s Solana liquidity has stopped, with about 3,408 SOL left, worth only around $185,000.\n\nConclusion\n\nVolatility is not news in the crypto industry, and investors are wisely making decisions around this factor. Retail investors are flocking to InQubeta\u2019s presale as they recognize this blockchain ICO as the go-to for diversifying their portfolios and claiming a significant return on investment (ROI). SOL holders also expect a more favorable analysis as FTX sell-offs round up. These top crypto coins represent the ever-changing dynamics of the crypto market. Investors who purchase QUBE quickly before the fifth stage runs out will improve their ROI potential upon launch.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\n\n\nContact Info:\n\nName: Lee Freemans\n\nEmail: Send Email\n\nOrganization: InQubeta\n\nWebsite: https://inqubeta.ai/\n\n\n\nRelease ID: 89113515\n\nIn the event of any inaccuracies, problems, or queries arising from the content shared in this press release, we encourage you to notify us immediately at error@releasecontact.com.

        "title": "Is Solana (SOL) Worth the Hype? - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Crypto investors are buzzing about Solana again, and with good reason: the value of SOL is up over 350% since a year ago:\n\nIt has many of the hallmarks of a good investment: it\u2019s a real project (a leading Layer 1), with real users (about 100K/day), generating real revenue (about $50K/day in fees).\n\nBut is it a good long-term investment?\n\nAt Bitcoin Market Journal, we\u2019re in this for the long haul. And personally, I think Solana is a long shot in the long term. Here\u2019s why.\n\nThere Can Be Only One (or Two)\n\nOur first investing thesis is that while lots of experiments happen in the early stages of a new technology, ultimately only one (or sometimes two) big platforms survive in the long run. (Think PCs and Macs, Androids and iPhones, etc.)\n\nIn the traditional tech world, this is because big players get bigger, mostly through network effects: the bigger you get, the easier for new customers to join you. The smaller companies either get acquired, or driven out of business.\n\nThis is how we end up with Google gobbling up all the search business, OpenAI overtaking AI, and Salesforce forcing out other CRMs.\n\nIn the emergent world of blockchain technology, we are only just starting to understand what the categories even are. But one category is definitely smart contract platforms (a.k.a. Layer 1s), the operating system for crypto.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is, by all measures, the 800-pound gorilla in this space. They have the most users, the most revenue, the most developers. So for a competing Layer-1 like Solana, Ethereum is the one to beat.\n\nFor all the hype, let\u2019s look at how Solana stacks up:\n\nEthereum Solana Daily Active Users 300,000 100,000 Daily Fees $5,000,000 $50,000 Active Developers 200 75\n\nSource: Token Terminal (rounded for readability)\n\nThis is not to say that Solana must beat Ethereum in order to survive. Niche search engines like DuckDuckGo or WolframAlpha (I\u2019m still waiting for WolframBeta) have survived against Google. But their market share is tiny by comparison.\n\nAs long-term investors, we don\u2019t want to pick the projects that will survive; we want to pick the projects that will thrive. The numbers above show you that Solana has traction, but it still has a way to go.\n\nIt\u2019s Not the Technology, It\u2019s the Users\n\nBlockchain nerds get really excited about Solana\u2019s faster throughput (due to its Proof of History consensus algorithm vs. Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake), and its developer friendliness (they can use languages like Rust and C, vs. having to learn Ethereum\u2019s Solidity).\n\nThe tech crowd gets really excited about the tech, but no one else does. This is because the market does not really care about technology, the market cares about the users.\n\nIf a company is building a new blockchain application, where would they want to build it?\n\nThe one with a better consensus algorithm, or the one where more users are going to be able to use it?\n\nThe one with an easier programming language, or the one that\u2019s going to generate more revenue and fees?\n\nThe underdog, or the existing leader?\n\nCompanies will generally go with bigger tech platforms, because they\u2019re a safer bet. There\u2019s safety in numbers.\n\nBut what about investors? My experience is that investors also do not really care about the technology, they care about whether they can make money. The technology is only relevant if it\u2019s going to lead to a higher price multiple in the end.\n\nVHS vs. Betamax, MP3 vs. FLAC, QWERTY vs. any other keyboard layout: often the inferior technology wins. In blockchain, especially, the tech is only relevant if it leads to more users.\n\nMore users = more network effects = more value.\n\nYou want to find winning long-term investments? Look for blockchain projects with userbases that are large and growing. (Remember that before this recent price rally, the crypto outlets were bemoaning Solana\u2019s drop in daily users.)\n\nWhere are the Killer Apps?\n\nLayer 1s are like operating systems: to grab those critical users, you\u2019ve got to have some killer apps. For example, VisiCalc put the Apple II on the map, AOL introduced the Internet to the masses, and Siri made the iPhone indispensable.\n\n(In blockchain, we call them decentralized apps or \u201cdapps,\u201d but c\u2019mon, they\u2019re just apps.)\n\nOn Solana, you\u2019ve got the usual assortment of dapps: a DEX (Serum), an AMM (Raydium), wallets (Phantom), borrowing/lending (Solend), NFT marketplaces (Magic Eden). I think of these as copycats of bigger, more popular dapps on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, there are a few dapps that take advantage of Solana tech:\n\nThe decentralized music platform Audius lets artists publish directly to listeners and cut out the middleman, using Solana\u2019s higher throughput and lower transaction fees to handle a large volume of microtransactions.\n\nThe MMO game Star Atlas runs a complex game economy with real-time transactions\u2014all those tiny transactions are easier and faster to process on Solana than Ethereum.\n\nMango Markets offers decentralized spot trading and perpetual futures, which is nothing new, but Solana\u2019s speed and efficiency can allow for higher-frequency trading with lower latency.\n\nSo it\u2019s possible that Solana can carve out a niche around dapps that require high-speed microtransactions. If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019d want to see a lot more of these specific dapps launching over the next year: dapps that you simply couldn\u2019t build on Ethereum.\n\nInvestor Takeaway: So Long, Solana\n\nThe recent price gains are likely due to excitement over Solana\u2019s Breakpoint community conference, and bullish sentiment from influencers like Cathie Wood.\n\nBut it\u2019s unlikely that Solana will unseat Ethereum anytime soon. I don\u2019t see any reason to jump on this bandwagon, especially when prices are triple what they were just a month ago.\n\nBut technology is full of surprises, and the early leaders aren\u2019t always the later leaders. Ethereum may not be the Layer 1 for the long term, and Solana may carve out a profitable niche. But at the moment, ETH is still the one to beat.\n\nSo for now, it\u2019s so long, Solana. But we\u2019ll keep an eye on you.\n\nFor more tips on building wealth with bitcoin and crypto, subscribe to our daily Bitcoin Market Journal newsletter."
