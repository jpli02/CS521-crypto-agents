        "content": "FTX recently transferred approximately $316 million in digital assets to various crypto exchanges, according to on-chain data.\n\nOver the past several weeks, the beleaguered crypto exchange has been rapidly divesting portions of its crypto holdings, including assets like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), as part of its bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFor context, FTX executed crypto transfers worth over $60 million between Nov. 7 and Nov. 8, according to insights from Lookonchain.\n\nThese transactions have added to the selling pressure in a market influenced by optimism over the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSolana dominates FTX Transfers\n\nAn analysis of FTX transfers by Lookonchain revealed that Solana (SOL) accounts for more than half of the transfers made by the exchange.\n\nAs of Nov. 8, the distressed exchange has moved 4.8 million SOL tokens, equivalent to $187 million.\n\nThese transactions may likely exert additional selling pressure on the token that has seen a recent resurgence. However, SOL\u2019s price has remained resilient, trading above $40.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, it has even seen a 5.22% increase, reaching $43.75, data from CryptoSlate showed. This positive trend has been a consistent theme throughout the year, with SOL gaining over 330% since the beginning of the year, recently hitting a yearly high of $46.\n\nSOL is the most significant asset on FTX\u2019s balance sheet, valued at over $1 billion.\n\nOther assets transferred\n\nIn addition to its Solana transactions, FTX has executed substantial transfers of other digital assets. These transfers encompassed approximately $32 million in ETH, $14.3 million in Polygon\u2019s MATIC, and $4.46 million in Lido\u2019s LDO.\n\nFTX also moved $4 million in Maker, $3.1 million in Sushi, and $1.6 million in Aave tokens, among others. These transactions are geared towards compensating FTX customers and investors who suffered losses from last year\u2019s crash. The exchange recently moved to sell $744 million worth of its Trust assets held at Grayscale and Bitwise.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Relisting Cardano (ADA), MATIC, and Solana (SOL) on Robinhood: CEO\u2019s EU Expansion Strategy Unveiled - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Robinhood missed its quarterly earnings expectations in Q3, leading to announcements that it will be expanding its crypto trading services to the EU.\n\nAsked about the possible relisting of ADA and Solana, CEO Tenev said that he awaits regulatory clarity as he warned the US government about losing out on crypto innovation.\n\nIn June this year, Robinhood Markets announced that it would be delisting Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) after the three were named in an SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. In a recent earnings call with investors and the media, CEO Vlad Tenev revealed the conditions for relisting the three tokens amid a broader uptick in crypto prices.\n\nRobinhood recorded $467 million in third-quarter revenues, slightly missing out on the market\u2019s estimate of $479 million. One of the most significant factors in the underwhelming performance was the drastic dip in crypto trading volume on the platform. In Q3, Robinhood recorded a 55% drop in crypto activity.\n\nIn a call with analysts and the media, CEO Vlad Tenev was tasked with explaining the company\u2019s outlook on crypto moving forward.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s hard for me to speculate on activity predictions and the broader cryptocurrency market,\u201d he stated in response to the crypto downtrend.\n\nWe\u2019re focused on using this as an opportunity to build our capabilities, build the platform. You\u2019ve heard me talk in this call about how we want to make sure customers who are using Robinhood for crypto know that they\u2019re getting terrific pricing. And so we\u2019ve continued to make progress there.\n\nRelisting Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), Expanding into EU\n\nWith the dip in crypto volume, the question of the delisting of three of the most popular cryptos earlier was bound to come up, and it did. John Todaro of New York-based investment manager Needham & Company asked Tenev when we should expect the relisting.\n\n\u201cWhat would give you comfortability to relist some? Is it some of these ongoing suits maybe with Coinbase that need to get resolved? Any clarity there?\u201d posed Todaro.\n\nIn response, Tenev claimed Robinhood\u2019s direction mostly depends on US authorities. He declined to point to one specific condition the tokens need to meet for their relisting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what specifically we\u2019re waiting for to give us comfort. I think that rules \u2014 rule-making court case data, that all helps,\u201d stated Tenev.\n\nAnd of course, we\u2019ll continue to push for regulatory clarity because I think it would be a shame for the innovation that we\u2019ve been seeing in crypto to be co-opted overseas. I think it\u2019s very, very important for the US to remain a leader in every new technology in the industry that we possibly can.\n\nThe three tokens have all notched gains in the past 24 hours. MATIC and SOL have gained over 5%, with ADA gaining a paltry 1.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, Robinhood is expanding to the European market. This follows the company\u2019s expansion into the UK earlier this year. It comes after the enactment of MiCA regulatory framework, which holds crypto companies to higher standards.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "title": "Exploring SOL's rebound: Solana's turbocharged proof-of-history - OKX",
        "content": "Roller coaster \u2014 that's the phrase many crypto traders would likely use to describe the fall and rise of Solana's native SOL coin. Since declining to $8 lows following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, Solana has been on a tear as of late.\n\nThanks to the recent excitement behind the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, we're seeing SOL rally massively. So much so, the token managed to erase all of its FTX-related losses. As SOL coin holders are setting their sights higher, there's no better time for the crypto curious to ask: what is Solana? And, how is SOL currently leading the altcoin charge?\n\nFrom understanding its unique proof-of-history (PoH) innovation to exploring the vast Solana ecosystem, here's everything you need to know about Solana and its much-talked-about performance in the blockchain space.\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nSolana is a Layer 1 blockchain platform that aims to provide high-performance, scalability, and security. It uses a unique combination of technologies, including PoH and tower byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), to achieve its impressively high throughput of up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThe history of Solana\n\nConsidered by many crypto enthusiasts as a next generation blockchain that builds on the ground covered by Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana's origins date back to 2017. Motivated by scalability issues faced in the blockchain trilemma, former Qualcomm engineer Anatoly Yakovenko published a white paper about an innovative decentralized timekeeping method.\n\nEssentially, the timekeeping method for distributed systems would be a cryptographic clock that allows nodes to verify the order of events without relying on a central trust authority. This would go on to become the PoH that Solana is best known for, and it allows a decentralized network of nodes to match the performance of a single node.\n\nSince teaming up with fellow former Qualcomm engineer Greg Fitzgerald and rebranding their project from Loom to Solana in early 2018, the Solana team has gone on to achieve numerous key milestones. These include the following:\n\nSolana Labs secured $20,000,000 in funding in 2019 from investors including Messari and Multicoin Capital.\n\nSolana launched its Mainnet Beta network in 2020.\n\nAt its peak in November 2021, Solana achieved a maximum total value locked of almost $10,000,000,000.\n\nSolana launched Solana Pay \u2014 an open, near-zero gas fee payments framework with an approved app integration on Shopify, in 2022.\n\nVisa announced a Solana partnership that allows its partners to send or receive USDC settlement payments via the Solana blockchain in late 2023.\n\nProof of history: the rocket-powered engine behind Solana's speed\n\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain that offers a unique set of features, making it stand out in the crowded crypto landscape. One of these defining features of Solana is PoH \u2014 a timestamping feature that enables for lightning-fast transaction processing.\n\nWhile Ethereum and Bitcoin can sometimes experience delays and high transaction fees due to network congestion, Solana's innovative PoH technology organizes transactions efficiently, leading to rapid confirmation times. Thanks to PoH, Solana can handle an impressive 65,000 TPS, making it one of the fastest blockchains in existence with such a high throughput. This is because it doesn't require nodes to communicate with each other to validate transactions and blocks.\n\nHow proof-of-history works\n\nPoH is like an ultra-precise stopwatch for the Solana blockchain that prioritizes the correct order of actions as much as the actions themselves. It creates timestamps for every action on the blockchain, making sure everything happens in the right order, just like a stopwatch at a race.\n\nThis stopwatch-like efficiency is crucial for a blockchain to handle many transactions quickly without getting bogged down and congested. The best part is that PoH accomplishes all this without compromising blockchain security thanks to Solana's cryptographic verifiable delay function (VDF). This adds an extra layer of security and guarantees that the timing of events remains verified and trustworthy within the Solana network.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum\n\nTo gain a better understanding of Solana's strengths, it helps to compare it to the most widely adopted smart contract platform \u2014 Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is renowned as the pioneer of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). However, Ethereum's network often faces congestion issues, resulting in high gas fees and slower transaction times. It's these issues that led to the birth of Solana as it addresses these problems head-on with its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees.\n\nTo summarize, here's a brief comparison of Solana and Ethereum and how they measure up against one another.\n\nSolana Ethereum Consensus mechanism Proof of Stake Proof of Stake Transaction throughput 65,000 TPS 30 TPS Transaction fees Low High (Low with Layer 2 solutions) Ecosystem Growing Large\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: consensus mechanisms\n\nEthereum's transition to PoS focuses on mitigating the environmental impact of proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain operations, offering scalability while maintaining network security. In contrast, Solana prioritizes speed and scalability from the outset, making it highly suitable for high-throughput applications. While Ethereum emphasizes sustainability, Solana aims at optimal performance and efficiency.\n\nUltimately, the answer to which is 'better' is subjective and depends on the goals of a particular blockchain project. The two blockchains represent different solutions to different challenges and depend on the project's unique needs and priorities. Ethereum addresses long-held environmental and throughput concerns thanks to its previous use of PoW. Meanwhile, Solana places a premium on high-speed, high-throughput applications but sometimes faces network outages and decentralization concerns.\n\nSolana's TPS vs Ethereum's TPS\n\nWhile the comparison of Solana vs Ethereum may be subjective, comparing their throughput will be more objective thanks to quantifiable metrics. Solana is well-known for its exceptionally high throughput. It can handle thousands of transactions per second and organize transactions efficiently while providing rapid confirmation. Since Solana's architecture is designed for high-speed, it naturally becomes the preferred choice for DApps that require quick and numerous transactions like decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum's throughput is more limited. It can process around 30 transactions per second on its mainnet. Ethereum has been grappling with network congestion and scalability issues, which have led to high gas fees and slower transaction times. Although Ethereum can rely on Layer 2 scaling solutions while still taking advantage of the robust decentralized security of Ethereum Layer 1, Ethereum's overall throughput still can't compete with Solana.\n\nSolana's transaction fees vs Ethereum's transaction fees\n\nGas fees vary significantly between Solana and Ethereum. Solana offers a cost-effective advantage with consistently low gas fees. This affordability is attributed to its PoH innovation, making Solana an attractive choice for users seeking to minimize transaction costs and engage with blockchain applications without the burden of expensive fees. In contrast, Ethereum is notorious for high and often unpredictable gas fees, especially during periods of network congestion. This makes transactions and interactions with DApps costly in the long run for active Ethereum ecosystem users. While Ethereum is working on scalability improvements with the help of Layer 2 scaling solutions, Solana currently stands out as the more cost-efficient option for blockchain activities.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: ecosystem comparison\n\nSolana and Ethereum are two prominent blockchain ecosystems, each with its unique strengths. Ethereum boasts a well-established and diverse ecosystem, serving as the pioneer for DApps, smart contracts, and NFTs. It's home to a bustling developer community and a multitude of DeFi projects, many of which DeFi enthusiasts will recognize. These include Uniswap, Rocket Pool, and Aave.\n\nIn contrast, Solana is a newer player in DeFi and is making waves among developers thanks to its lightning-fast and highly scalable blockchain. Its ecosystem is swiftly evolving, with a growing presence in DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi thanks to DApps like Marinade Finance and Magic Eden.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the clear leader in the DeFi space as it offers maturity and a broad user base, Solana has been no slouch either. According to DefiLlama, Solana has been steadily gaining in Total Value Locked, with the figure almost doubling since the start of the year from $210,470,000 to $412,250,000. Since this represents the amount of value stored on the Solana blockchain, it may represent a renewed interest in the DeFi capabilities of Solana post-FTX collapse.\n\nWhy is Solana rallying in 2023?\n\nWhile there may be many reasons why SOL coin's price is up more than 300% year-to-date, all reasons are likely pointing to the bullish sentiment caused by the Bitcoin spot ETF approval. In short, if traditional finance institutions like Blackrock are getting involved in cryptocurrencies and applying for spot ETFs, fund managers and institutional investors would have to buy Bitcoin to act as reserves in their ETF when meeting the demand for the Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nAdditionally, launching a spot ETF on a traditional stock exchange would also make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin more accessible to the masses. This is because these traditional stock exchange users will be able to bypass the complexities of interacting with a cryptocurrency exchange and instead trade Bitcoin via the spot ETF like they would with shares of a stock. In a sense, this legitimizes the case for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a digital asset to be held for the long-term.\n\nThis excitement for the legitimacy of crypto has likely played a big part in the bullish sentiment for altcoins like Solana. Additionally, Solana seems to have been gradually developing strong foundations over the past few months. From cutting deals and partnerships with Visa and Shopify to stabilizing its network and reducing network outages, Solana has had a stellar 2023 and looks to build on this momentum.\n\nWith the right developments, Solana could be a top contender among competing Layer 1 blockchains in the months to come.\n\nFinal words and next steps\n\nFrom explaining the ins and outs of PoH to learning about its bullish rally in 2023, we hope our guide to what is Solana has been useful for you in understanding how Solana stands out as a Layer 1 blockchain.\n\n2023 has been a thrilling year for Solana, marked by a remarkable resurgence in the value of SOL. Although the recent excitement surrounding a potential Bitcoin spot ETF approval has played a significant role in SOL's impressive rally and erased earlier losses linked to the FTX collapse, Solana still has a long way to go before reclaiming its 2021 all-time highs.\n\nThrough partnerships with industry giants like Visa, and sustained development efforts, many believe Solana is a Layer 1 blockchain poised for a promising future. With the right momentum and further developments, Solana is well-positioned to be a formidable contender among Layer 1 blockchains in the months ahead."

Solana is a Layer 1 blockchain renowned for its rapid transaction speeds and cost-effectiveness.\n\nDuring the previous bullish market, Solana experienced a remarkable surge of over 15,000% within a year. This earned the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d moniker and garnered an extensive following.\n\nHowever, it also endured one of the most severe declines in recent memory. This has led to the price of SOL plummeting by 96% from its all-time high (ATH).\n\nNevertheless, Solana has exhibited encouraging indications of a resurgence in recent times. This Solana price forecast takes into account Solana\u2019s past challenges. Its underlying strengths, community support, and technical analysis to predict SOL\u2019s short-term and long-term price movements.\n\nSOL\u2019s Price Forecast Summary\n\nAfter a private sale period and several presale stages, SOL\u2019s value reached $0.22 at the end of the last presale phase .\n\nThe coin was released on the crypto exchanges in 2020 and fluctuated between $0.50 and $1 .\n\nSOL has a maximum value of $32,13 in 2023 , trying to compensate for its losses in 2022.\n\nSOL\u2019s price prediction for 2023 is dependent on the approval of Bitcoin spot ETF and institutional interests.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving triggers a bull run . The coin\u2019s value for 2024 is forecasted to reach the expected prices if\n\nSolana\u2019s interest in NFTs, its partnership deals, and its internal projects are some factors that determine SOL\u2019s price in 2025 and 2030.\n\nYear Possible High Possible Low 2023 $24 $9.88 2024 $50.89 $35.23 2025 $66 $92.5 2030 $144 $80\n\nSolana Price History\n\nThe native coin of the Solana blockchain, SOL, underwent private sales and presale sessions. At the last presale stage in March 2020, SOL was sold to the public at $0.22. It later launched on crypto exchanges and gained market value, trading between $0.50 and $1.\n\nInterestingly, in July 2020, the coin\u2019s market value surged tremendously, trading above the $1 price level. It maintained the bullish momentum in 2021 and hit the $10 price level in March 2021.\n\nThe project\u2019s success drew the attention of venture capitalists, who invested handsomely despite being listed on crypto exchanges.\n\nThese investors increased the liquidity of the asset, boosting its market value significantly and pushing it to the $200 price level. With this impressive market boost, in November 2021, SOL hit a peak value of $259.96, which is currently its all-time high.\n\nHowever, SOL\u2019s price nosedived when FTX and Almeda Research, which had a significant amount of the coin, sold it in 2022. This resulted in an enormous loss of 96.76% from its all-time high as the currency plunged to $8.42. Since the ugly incident, the asset has tried to recover from the losses.\n\nRemarkably, it kick-started its 2023 journey with a bull run, which peaked at $32.13 in July 2023. This serves as SOL\u2019s current yearly high for 2023.\n\nSeptember 29, OL\u2019s price is $20.19 at 9:20 AM EST, reflecting a price gain of 5% in the last 24 hours. However, this market value indicates that SOL\u2019s worth is still down by 92% from its all-time high.\n\nSOL\u2019s Price History Key Points\n\nSolana underwent a private sales period and various presale stages ; during the final presale phase, its value was $0.22.\n\nIn 2020, the coin was launched on crypto exchanges and traded between $0.50 and $1 price levels.\n\nFollowing a market liquidity boost by venture capitalists, it recorded an all-time high of $259.96 in November 2021.\n\nFTX and Almeda Research\u2019s sell-off of SOL forced the crypto asset to plummet in 2022. This caused a loss of 96.76% for its all-time high.\n\nIn 2023, SOL currently has a peak value of $32.13 in an attempt to recover from the losses it recorded in 2022.\n\nSolana Price Forecast 2023 \u2013 2030\n\nSolana Price Forecast 2023\n\nDespite the difficulties, Solana still has the potential to grow again in 2023 because of the growing institutional interest and inflow. This shows that the Solana blockchain is perceived to be credible and stable.\n\nAgain, Solana\u2019s dominant position in the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) space shows its strength and attracts users and investors. However, the cryptocurrency market\u2019s volatility makes predicting its future for 2023 difficult.\n\nBut we have some predictions because of its striving ability and the expected Bitcoin ETF approval that may happen this year. The coin is expected to have an average of $14, a yearly low of $9.88, and a maximum price of $24.\n\nThe table below shows SOL\u2019s price forecast for the remaining months of 2023.\n\nMonth Average Possible High Possible Low September 2023 $14 $17.78 $10.67 October 2024 $16.65 $24 $11.49 November 2025 $16.99 $22.1 $10 December 2030 $15 $21.45 $9.88\n\nSOL\u2019s Price Prediction 2024\n\nForecasting SOL\u2019s price in 2024 is based on the forthcoming Bitcoin halving, which will set the crypto market in a rally. The Solana market will be positively affected, as investors want the excitement. Solana can process up to 5,000 transactions in a second at cheaper fees.\n\nThis gives it an edge over other blockchains like Ethereum when the expected bull run comes. Its unique features will attract more investors to the network to ensure faster transactions, as everyone would like to maximize profit.\n\nMoreover, by the end of 2024, Solana could attract hundreds of new projects to run on its network, boosting its value.\n\nAlso, the network might increase its efforts in encouraging the development of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). With this, the growing US base could push the price.\n\nThis is based on its smart move to bring NFT projects onto its blockchain in 2023. Considering these factors, the coin is expected to have a peak value of $50.89 and a lowest price of $35.23.\n\nSolana\u2019s Price Forecast for 2025\n\nSOL\u2019s price action in 2024 is a useful determinant factor that will help predict its value in 2025. Also, if the network continues innovating its (DeFi) ecosystem by creating sustainable projects, it could gain more adoption, raising its value.\n\nAgain, partnership deals with other blockchain networks, mostly with those aiming to revolutionize decentralized finance, bodes well for Solana. It could draw the attention of investors, including the traditional finance system, to collaborate and improve the financial market.\n\nMoreover, if the Solana network works hard to outperform the Ethereum network substantially, it might gain more adoption from investors. This may have a positive impact on the price of SOL. Based on these parameters, Solana\u2019s worth is expected to grow in 2025, trading between $66 and $92.5.\n\nSolana Price Prediction 2030\n\nMany members of the Solana community are hopeful for new all-time highs (ATHs). However, it\u2019s essential to recognize that the future price movement of SOL will likely be driven by more natural market forces of supply and demand.\n\nDuring its previous bull run, FTX held the largest stake in Solana, and FTX founder Sam Bankkman-Fried admitted to fraud in December 2022.\n\nThese charges included manipulating the price of the FTX exchange token, FTT, which could have also influenced Solana\u2019s price. Considering these factors, Solana\u2019s growth trajectory is expected to be less explosive due to decreased institutional and venture capitalist investments.\n\nNevertheless, Solana remains a dynamic and innovative cryptocurrency project, recently introducing products like Solana Mobile. Solana\u2019s history is interesting, given its two-year existence marked by price fluctuations.\n\nShort-term forecasts may not align with the high expectations of Solana holders. But there is a glimmer of hope in long-term projections, suggesting that by 2030, Solana may bolster its value.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to maintain a realistic perspective, acknowledging that 2030 is a time quite far, which makes the validity of these predictions uncertain.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t anticipate Solana reaching its previous all-time highs (ATHs) by 2030. There is still room for potential success if the mentioned issues are addressed. Our Solana price projection suggests an average price of $105, a peak of $144, and a bottom of $80 by the end of 2030.\n\nOther Experts and Analysts\u2019 Predictions for SOL\u2019s Price\n\nBased on CoinCodex technical analysis, Solana\u2019s) is expected to increase and reach $21.08 in 2023. The short-term price is projected to be $18.79 by the same date.\n\nOn the other hand, DigitalCoinPrice offered a more optimistic Solana cryptocurrency price forecast. Digital Coin Price\u2019s SOL price prediction indicates that Solana might trade at approximately $52.76 in 2023 and reach a high of $246.50 by 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, CryptoNews projects the annual minimum price for Solana in 2024 is anticipated to be around $19.61. In contrast, the maximum Solana price projection for the following year suggests a peak of $141.72.\n\nFurthermore, according to Coinpedia Solana Price Prediction, SOL will trade at a minimum price of approximately $387.9 in 2030, an average price of $459.165 and a high of $530.43.\n\nWhat is Solana, and What is it Used for?\n\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and cryptocurrency projects. Launched in 2020, Solana has gained significant attention in the blockchain space for its exceptional speed, scalability, and low transaction costs.\n\nSolana is used for many applications thanks to its robust features. It supports smart contracts, enabling developers to create decentralized applications for various purposes. This includes decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized exchanges, and more.\n\nIts high throughput and low latency make it suitable for applications that require fast and secure transactions. One of Solana\u2019s primary use cases is in the DeFi sector, which provides the infrastructure for lending, borrowing, and trading digital assets.\n\nSolana\u2019s efficient consensus mechanism, called Proof of History (PoH), combined with its Proof of Stake (PoS) system, enhances security while maintaining high transaction speeds. Solana\u2019s interoperability features allow it to connect with other blockchain networks, facilitating cross-chain asset transfers and expanding its utility.\n\nFactors that can Influence the Price of Solana?\n\nIn the past, institutional and venture capitalist interests played a significant role in influencing SOL\u2019s price. However, recent price declines have led many major holders, or \u201cwhales,\u201d to exit the coin.\n\nA recent key factor affecting SOL\u2019s price is the legal action taken by the SEC against Coinbase, Binance, and the Solana project itself. If the SEC succeeds in proving that Solana is a security, this could have a substantial negative impact on SOL\u2019s price.\n\nFurthermore, SOL\u2019s price could also be adversely affected by ongoing issues related to centralization and network outages. If these problems persist, SOL\u2019s growth potential may be constrained as the blockchain may not meet its intended purpose.\n\nConversely, if these issues are successfully addressed, Solana\u2019s user base could expand significantly, potentially driving a substantial price increase. Despite a 93% decrease, Solana still maintains over 230,000 daily users, indicating persistent demand and the potential for price recovery.\n\nLastly, SOL\u2019s price is influenced by the broader cryptocurrency market. It is likely to follow the overall market performance, though the extent of this correlation hinges on the factors mentioned earlier.\n\nSOL\u2019s Potential Highs and Lows\n\nDespite difficulties in the crypto market following unfavorable events, Solana has demonstrated growth potential.\n\nIf the asset\u2019s price prediction goes as expected, the coin could record the following possible highs and lows:\n\nYear Possible High Possible Low 2023 $24 $9.88 2024 $50.89 $35.23 2025 $66 $92.5 2030 $144 $80\n\nSolana Overview\n\nCryptocurrency Solana Ticker Symbol SOL Market Cap $8.2 Billion Market Cap Rank No. 10 Market Cap Dominance 0.742% Price $20.08 Volume (24H) $312 Million Price Change (24H) 4.9% Circulating Supply 412,843,731 SOL Total Supply 558,633,864 SOL Volume to Market Cap Ratio 0.0377 All-Time High $259.96 All-Time Low $0.500801\n\nIs Solana a Good Buy?\n\nSolana is a robust project with an intriguing and valuable use case and impressive technological capabilities. Its community\u2019s strong support and resilience, even during challenging times, is noteworthy.\n\nWhile we anticipate that Solana has significant growth potential, it is crucial to acknowledge the associated risks. Apart from facing scrutiny from the SEC, Solana also carries technical vulnerabilities that could lead to network failures during periods of increased demand.\n\nConclusion\n\nSolana is a layer-1 blockchain with proof-of-history consensus, enabling it to run fast transactions at cheaper rates. It is developed in a manner that allows it to validate transactions securely and does not require layer-2 solutions to make it stable.\n\nIts blockchain abilities allow it to be compatible with other blockchains, giving it an edge in the crypto market. Crypto experts show optimism about the coin\u2019s future performance, predicting a low of $459.165 and a peak of $530.43.\n\nConsidering SOL\u2019s records, this might be achieved if the network maintains ecosystem developments and if the expected events happen.\n\nFAQS\n\nWhat Is Solana (SOL)?
