        "content": "The Solana based DeFi liquidity protocol, Parrot has recently become talk of the town for its token killing proposal. The protocol\u2019s governance has proposed to transit it into \u2018No Token Protocol\u2019 and redemption of PRT tokens.\n\nParrot raised approximately $85 million via Initial Dex Offering (IDO) in September, 2021 with plans to disrupt the liquidity market in Solana ecosystem. The protocol also introduced PAI stablecoin that was backed by LP token collateral.\n\nCommunity members have proposed to redeem PRT token as the Parrot Protocol team has failed to achieve its goal and to gain real traction.\n\nThe proposal states, \u201cWhile the team prefers to continue operating the Parrot Protocol, we understand that many PRT holders would like to redeem their PRT tokens for their treasury value.\u201d\n\nIt will allow PRT holders to redeem their tokens for the value of liquid assets on a pro-rata basis with the token redemption price set to $0.0045 each.\n\nIn addition, protocol\u2019s buyback will be distributed to PRT/yPRT LP token holders after the proposal. The 8 days redemption program will take place on the OpenBook, a DEX built on Solana.\n\nThe proposal is opposed massively by the community but the on-chain governance has already received enough votes (99.9%) to pass the proposal.\n\nHowever, the proposal is not in the favor of PRT Holders with the community claiming the team is gaining most benefits out of this."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst thinks the Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) will rise more than 10x at some point in 2025.\n\nThe pseudonymous crypto trader Inmortal tells his 194,800 Twitter followers that SOL will likely be priced at $250 at some point in 2025.\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $23.34, suggesting an increase of over 971% should it hit Inmortal\u2019s target.\n\nIn the coming months, however, the crypto trader believes that SOL will likely drop below $20 before resuming its uptrend.\n\n\u201c$20 before $40 SOL.\u201d\n\nThe analyst is also keeping an eye on the decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK), which he predicts will see a big move to the upside after more than a year of accumulation.\n\n\u201cNot surprised about LINK pump.\n\n> It\u2019s terribly undervalued.\n\n> +400 days accumulation.\n\n> Textbook deviation.\n\nYou are welcome.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he appears to predict Chainlink will rally to close to $20. At time of writing, LINK is trading for $7.59.\n\nInmortal also thinks that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely revisit its all-time high (ATH) at around $69,000 during the second half of 2024 if it follows the timeline of its previous market cycle.\n\n\u201cIf this cycle is similar to the previous one:\n\n> The mid-cycle rally would be over by now.\n\n> There would be 467 days left to get back to previous ATH levels.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, he sees Bitcoin rallying on the back of a short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when traders who borrow an asset at a certain price in hopes of selling it for lower to pocket the difference are forced to buy back the assets they borrowed as momentum moves against them, triggering further rallies.\n\nSays Inmortal,\n\n\u201cShorts are getting greedy. Let\u2019s squeeze them just to have fun. Eyes on $30,400.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, BTC is worth $29,117.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
