        "title": "The arrest of a man who exploited a Solana platform tests the boundaries between coding and crime. - Fortune",
        "content": "Avraham Eisenberg is not a good person. The crypto trader and self-described game theorist exploited a weakness in a decentralized Solana market for over $100 million last October and then agreed to give some of it back\u2014so long as the service let him keep $67 million as a reward for finding the weakness. Meanwhile, a DAO project called Fortress previously accused Eisenberg, in his capacity of lead developer, of bilking it of $14 million.\n\nEisenberg says he\u2019s done nothing wrong. In the wake of the Solana exploit, he congratulated himself on Twitter, describing his decision to loot the project as a \u201chighly profitable trading strategy.\u201d His indifference to the harm he inflicted on the project\u2019s developers and innocent traders shows Eisenberg is ruthless and callous. In short, he\u2019s a bad guy.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a criminal, however. The law draws a distinction between crimes and bad acts\u2014and not all bad acts are crimes. It\u2019s perfectly legal, for instance, to stand someone up for a date or to stand by while a puppy drowns. These are horrible things to do but they are not against the law.\n\nEisenberg appears to view his behavior in the same light. For him, the world of DeFi is the digital version of the jungle and, so long as people operate within the autonomous computer code that governs that jungle, then anything goes. He is hardly the only one in crypto with this outlook. Unfortunately for Eisenberg, the U.S. government doesn\u2019t see it this way.\n\nThe Justice Department arrested him in late December, charging Eisenberg with commodities fraud and market manipulation, while the Commodities Futures Trading Commission filed charges of its own a few days later. And on Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2014whose chairman was again late to the party but always eager to promote himself\u2014sued Eisenberg too.\n\nThe various agencies argue that\u2014DeFi ethos be damned\u2014what Eisenberg did was illegal wash trading. The term describes taking both sides of a trade, typically to pump up the price and then exploit others who rush in to get a piece of what looks like a hot trading market. And this is exactly what Eisenberg did\u2014but in a corner of the crypto market whose norms are very different than venues for trading stocks or pork bellies.\n\nEisenberg is not guilty for now. But if he is convicted, it will underscore that no matter how much DeFi pushes the boundaries of trading and governance, the state remains the ultimate authority of the line between bad acts and crime.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nBitcoin rose above $22,000 for the first time since September, in part due to expectations the Fed will slow interest rate hikes.

        "content": "A crypto analyst has shared a list of 13 new crypto projects to watch out for including Sui Network.\n\nThese projects could print a 50 \u2013 100x growth while contributing to industry evolution.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of investments in some crypto projects is their potential to produce a very massive return on investment. From Bitcoin (BTC) to Dogecoin (DOGE), and even Solana (SOL), the majority of cryptocurrencies are up by massive percentages despite the current outlook in the broader digital currency ecosystem.\n\nIn a recent tweet, a crypto expert with the user name Miles Deutscher, the most progressive digital tokens have not even been launched yet. He shared a list of the top 13 protocols that will yield likely yield a 50 \u2013 100 growth trend to mimic a similar trend like Solana and Polygon (MATIC).\n\n\u2014 LAYER 1s \u2014 1. @SuiNetwork Sui is a high performance L1 which uses the Move programming language. It was founded by former FaceBook engineers, who worked on the now defunct Diem project. Here's all you need to know: https://t.co/ExRQ6WHK4J \u2014 Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) January 22, 2023\n\nDeutscher\u2019s top 13 Protocols\n\nThe number one project on Deutscher\u2019s list is the Sui Network, a high-performance L1 which uses the Move programming language. The protocol was founded by 5 former Meta engineers who once worked on the tech giant\u2019s Libra/Diem project.\n\nThe Sui Network has been under development for quite some time and it recently released its Testnet Wave 2 upgrade in readiness for its yet-to-be-announced full launch. The technological prowess of the Sui Network can be likened in part to that of Aptos which also utilizes the same Move programming language.\n\nWith speed, large memory, and expressiveness amongst the features highlighted by Deutscher, Sui Network is on track to hit a ready market when it finally launches.\n\nThe second of the crypto projects tapped for impressive growth is the Sei Network, a Cosmos-built first sector-specific L1 blockchain, specialized for trading to \u201cgive exchanges an unfair advantage.\u201d The emergence of Sei Network will benefit from its design as the first order-book-focused L1 blockchain, designed to be faster and more reliable than other types of blockchains.\n\nIn addition, the expert tapped Celestia as another top protocol to watch out for. Celestia is a modular network, enabling anyone to easily deploy their own blockchain with minimal overhead. Celestia is building an infrastructure that seeks to empower more builders across the board, and it is this sort of protocol that most venture capital firms are paying attention to as vital for the evolution of crypto.\n\nThe other protocols mentioned include Fuel Labs, Quai Network, zkSync, StarkWare, Arbitrum, Hermez, LayerZero, Zeta Blockchain, Quadrata Network, and Drift Protocol. The pick of these projects is based on their inherent technological buildup, as well as the current community enthusiasm they are building across the board.\n\nContribution of crypto projects to evolution\n\nMany proponents of the digital currency ecosystem and its underlying blockchain technology have argued that the industry is still evolving even though it is more than a decade already. While there has never really been a dearth of innovators in the space, developers are just beginning to showcase how ingenious they can be in helping to fuel the evolution of the broader ecosystem.\n\nWhile the roles of legacy digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) amongst others cannot be over-emphasized, these highlighted upcoming projects can also contribute to the inherent evolution of the digital currency ecosystem.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "title": "Aptos (APT) rallies 290% since the start of 2023: Wonder what led to the gains? Let's find out - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Source: APT/USD (CoinMarketCap)\n\nThe broader crypto market is off to a good start in 2023 after a nerve-wracking previous year. Bitcoin has been rallying above the $22,000 level for the first time in the past two months, while some altcoins have been performing great.One of these altcoins is the Aptos token, a relatively new altcoin in the market which recorded a sharp growth of around 290 percent since the beginning of the year. In this article, we will investigate Aptos and what is causing this terrific price rally.The Aptos coin (APT) was launched in October 2022 and owing to several innovative features embedded in the project, many dubbed it the \u2018Solana-killer.\u2019 However, it seems that the APT project enjoys great community support.Ever since the beginning of the year, APT has been on a constant rally. APT has gained over 50 percent in the last 48 hours and more than 108 percent over the past week, surpassing other popular altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and even Bitcoin (BTC).The token has been on a meteoric rise, owing to continued support from the fans and community. Aptos reached its all-time high price of $14.52 on January 22, 2023.So, what is contributing to this enormous rally? Well, there are multiple factors at play here. As mentioned before, Aptos is relatively new, and it packs many unique features that make the project appealing to the masses.The Aptos chain utilizes a completely new programming language, known as Move. The programming language was primarily designed for an abandoned project by Meta, known as Diem. The creator of Aptos, Mo Shaikh stated that the team of developers behind Aptos wants to work on the vision of Diem and create a scalable, fast blockchain that can be compatible with mass adoption and usage.Moreover, they have been joined by the developers of CryptoKitties, the popular Ethereum-based NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) games, as they have implemented a protocol named Jolteon through the Flow blockchain, which was also created by them. The Jolteon protocol however was created by the Aptos executives.According to Aptos CEO and cofounder Mo Shaikh, 2023 will be a great year for Aptos and has urged fans and supporters to keep an eye on the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) initiatives on the platform. From parallel transaction processing to Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), Aptos will venture and spread its tentacles across the DeFi space, while giving tough competition to some of the top smart contract-enabled blockchain platforms like Solana and Ethereum.Moreover, PancakeSwap, the biggest decentralized crypto exchange existing on the BNB Chain, announced on January 6 its deployment on the Aptos blockchain. The decision was finalized after their user community approved it. As soon as the announcement was made public, the APT prices skyrocketed by almost 97.6 percent.Following this announcement, one of the best cold crypto wallets in the world, the Atomic Wallet, stated that they would provide support for the token on their platform. Atomic Wallet has more than 3 million followers. Thus, APT will reach a massive number of users through them.Last but not least, a major boost for APT, came from an announcement made by the largest crypto exchange in the world, Binance on January 20. As per the announcement, Binance is increasing the listing fee for new projects on their platform to 3 percent from 1 percent. Team Binance stated that their Liquid Swap service would now include APT/BTC and APT/USDT trading pairs.A listing on Binance is one of the best ways to get attention in the market and Aptos has been pretty successful so far. At the time of writing, APT was trading at $13.78, down slightly by 1.79 percent over the previous day.Aptos is one of those emerging coins that has managed to get the attention of the masses and create community support for itself, thanks to its diverse array of features and services.However, this sudden spike in prices has led to speculations regarding whether it is market manipulation or not. Perhaps it is too early to decide anything. The present stat on the coin seems quite bullish, although the Fear and Greed index remains neutral for APT. However, if you are planning to invest in the Solana-killer, it is always recommended to conduct thorough market and project research before doing so."

It has implemented Proof of History (PoH), a protocol to embed passage of time into the blockchain data structure, and integrated it with TowerBFT the system\u2019s Proof-of-Staked based consensus mechanism.\n\nBy using PoH, which is a high frequency Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), Solana hopes to eliminate the issues which have given rise to other potential solutions, such as sharding.\n\nA Verifiable Delay Function is a function that requires more computational time to evaluate than to verify. Solana uses a serialized, recursive SHA256, periodically sampling the count and hash, as an effective VDF. This data structure takes real time to generate given the specific SHA256 instructions included on CPUs and can be verified in parallel by splitting the hash chain across multiple GPU cores. According to the company:\n\n\u201cSolana\u2019s specific implementation uses a sequential preimage resistant hash that runs over itself continuously with the previous output used as the next input. Periodically the count and the current output are recorded.\n\nFor a SHA256 hash function (also Bitcoin\u2019s hash algorithm), this process is impossible to parallelize without a brute force attack using 2\u00b9\u00b2\u2078 cores.\n\nWe can then be certain that real time has passed between each counter as it was generated, and that the recorded order of each counter is the same as it was in real time.\u201d\n\nIntegration With TowerBFT\n\nThe use of the PoH ledger allows a user to compute the state of all the nodes with a fraction of the messaging overhead of most PoS systems. It also works with Solana\u2019s version of PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) as the network\u2019s clock, allowing the protocol to encode vote lock-outs in the ledger.These lock-outs are used to ensure that Validators (block producing nodes) aren\u2019t able to vote on two separate forks of the blockchain at the same time. If an attempt is detected, the malicious Validator will be penalized and have his stake slashed.\n\nPractically, each time a validator votes for a specific version of the ledger at a specified PoH height, there is a lockout that is associated with that vote. That validator is restricted from voting on a future version of the ledger that doesn\u2019t contain that vote for a specified amount of PoH time (w/out the risk of slashing). Each additional vote on a ledger increases (doubles) the vote lockouts of each previous vote, creating an exponentially growing commitment to safety (consistency) on the given branch.\n\nProof of Stake\n\nTowerBFT thereby provides the slashing rules that underlie Solana\u2019s Proof of Stake consensus architecture. In this design, validators\u2019 ledger votes are weighted by the amount of capital (SOL) they have locked at stake while validating.\n\nValiators can also receive tokens from non-validating token holders and stake those tokens on their behalf. Rewards are distributed to validators in proportion to their stake, so non-validating token holders can earn rewards by delegating to a validator and receiving the associated rewards, minus a commission fee taken by the validator.\n\nSolana\u2019s block production is determined by a randomly generated leader schedule, which is set according to his proportion of the total stake at the start of an epoch. That is to say, a validator is expected to be elected leader with a frequency that is commiserate with their proportion of total stake (e.g. a validator with 20% of total stake will represent roughly 20% of the leader schedule)\n\nRewards for block production will be paid by both inflation, that is expected to reduce over time, and by transaction fees.\n\nIdeas that Matter\n\nThe novel use of PoH, TowerBFT and PoS aren\u2019t the only innovations that Solana is bringing to the table. The company has also created other viable systems that address some of the shortcomings in the first generation of decentralized blockchains.\n\nArchivers\n\nAt full capacity, Solana estimates that its blockchain would generate roughly 4 petabytes of data on an annual basis. If it were a requirement that a full node store this data, it would introduce a huge barrier to entry for participation in the protocol.\n\nTo address this, Solana is able to leverage PoH to stripe and store the growing ledger across storage light-clients (Archivers). This means that the ledger can be split up and distributed across many network participants with no single participant needing to store the entirety of the ledger while the network can ensure multiple redundancy of the global ledger. Additionally, this provides a low barrier to entry to become involved with Solana as a network participant. All is needed is some extra storage space and an internet connection and it is possible to begin earning Solana tokens are rewards for participating as an Archiver on the network.\n\nSolana plans to incentivize full nodes with an estimated 3% of SOL inflation (yearly), which is a clear benefit over Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin is the most valuable blockchain in the world when measured by market cap, full nodes aren\u2019t incentivized.\n\nTurbine\n\nThe amount of time it requires to propagate all blockchain data to all nodes can be a major hindrance to scalability, because of the lack of bandwidth.\n\nSolana thinks that the answer is to break the data down into packets, which is how BitTorrent distributes huge files with relatively small amounts of bandwidth. Turbine leverages the entire network to move data and allows nodes to do more with less.\n\nSealevel\n\nSolana thinks that parallel validation can be applied to smart contracts, and that the entire network can benefit from gains in efficiency.\n\nAccording to Solana:\n\n\u201cSolana\u2019s runtime can process tens of thousands of contracts in parallel, using as many cores as are available to the Validator. This is because Solana transactions describe all the states a transaction will read or write while executing. This not only allows for non-overlapping transactions to execute concurrently, but also for transactions that are only reading the same state to execute concurrently as well.\u201d\n\nIt is clear that Solana has created an integrated blockchain platform that offers up well thought out solutions to some of the biggest issues that decentralized blockchains face as they grow in popularity.\n\nThe SOL Token\n\nSolana also has a token, called SOL, which can be passed to nodes on the Solana blockchain for running an on-chain program or validating its output. Solana says that:\n\n\u201c\u2026a SOL may be split as many as 34 times. The fractional SOL is called a lamport. It is named in honor of Solana\u2019s biggest technical influence, Leslie Lamport. A lamport has a value of approximately 0.0000000000582 sol (2^-34).\u201d\n\nSolana Wallets\n\nSoftware Wallet\n\nHot wallets, also called software wallets, are one of the most popular cryptocurrency storage options. They are always online, hence the affiliation with the \u2018hot\u2019 tag. Investors can easily get a hot wallet once they open an account with a crypto exchange. This allows them to store and manage their private keys, which prove their ownership of their assets to the blockchain network. Hot wallets are usually more convenient for everyday crypto transactions and can be custodial or non-custodial.\n\nA custody wallet is responsible for storing assets to an exchange or a third-party platform. The user only places an order for a transfer or receipt, and the exchange signs off on the transaction, much like the traditional banking system. Meanwhile, a non-custodial or self-custody wallet gives the full responsibility to the end-user.\n\nHot wallets are usually free, but they are largely considered less secure due to their constant internet connectivity. An instance of a hot wallet is the Binance Wallet.\n\nHardware Wallet\n\nA Hardware wallet is a device which has been created to provide an extra layer of security when interacting with your various cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nNormally you would use your private key to move funds, the problem is though, if your computer has been compromised with malware or a virus, it is possible for your private keys to be captured and used to steal your funds.\n\nWith a hardware wallet, the private keys are stored on the device and never exposed to your computer, which means even if you are infected with such a program your private keys will remain safe. These options are safest way to store your crypto if you have more than a small amount.\n\nPopular examples of cold storage offerings are the Ledger and Trezor line of hardware wallet solutions, read our reviews:\n\nMobile wallet\n\nA mobile wallet is essentially a hot wallet on a smartphone device. They offer users an even more convenient way to use their coins for daily activities. Mobile wallets store and manage users' private keys while enabling them to pay for things they love with their digital assets.\n\nThese wallets are usually free and always online for transactions to be processed. Popular mobile wallets are eToro Money Wallet and Coinbase Wallet.\n\nDesktop wallet\n\nA desktop wallet is a PC version of a hot wallet. It is essentially software that an investor downloads into their personal computer or laptop for easy interaction with their digital coins. They also offer a browser extension which allows users to interact using an extension instead of downloading the entire software. Desktop wallets are also hack-prone due to their online nature. A popular example is the Exodus Wallet.\n\nPaper Wallet\n\nThe paper wallet is arguably the oldest form of crypto wallet. They are no longer common in the modern crypto industry. It contains users' public and private keys. The paper wallet is the least secure type of wallet as it can easily be lost, stolen, or torched.\n\nHow to Buy Solana on Binance\n\nAfter exploring where to buy and the coin\u2019s use cases, the next thing is to explore how to buy it for your portfolio. Binance is our recommended exchange, so we'll explore how to purchase the asset using Binance.\n\nStep 1: Sign Up\n\nGo to the Binance home page and click on \u201cRegister\u201d.\n\nBinance allows investors to register using their mobile phone, email address, or Google account. Most users choose the first two options and provide their phone numbers, emails, and desired passwords. A link will be sent to their registration channel of choice, and investors can click on it to authenticate their accounts.\n\nStep 2: Verify Your Identity\n\nLike many other regulated brokers, Binance requires that investors verify their identity before commencing their purchase.\n\nTo complete the process, visit the \u201cIdentification\u201d tab. Investors will have to share personal information, their proof of residence, and a government-verified means of identification. This process should take no more than a few minutes to complete.\n\nStep 3: Deposit Your Funds\n\nNext, investors will have to deposit into their Binance wallets. The exchange makes deposits possible using payment processors, wire transfers, bank deposits, and direct crypto transfers. And its required minimum deposit is $10.\n\nTo make a deposit, go to the \u201cPayment\u201d section and click \u201cAdd a new payment method\u201d to enter payment details. Alternatively, investors can click the \u201cBuy Crypto\u201d button to select a payment method and complete their transfer.\n\nStep 4: Buy\n\nWith a funded wallet, investors are ready to make a your purchase. Head to the \u201cBuy Crypto\u201d section and enter the desired amount. Click on \u201cContinue\u201d after reviewing the terms, and the wallet should be updated immediately.\n\nConclusion\n\nSolana is working to create scalability solutions for decentralized blockchain systems, and it has addressed some of the biggest issues that decentralized platforms face. By removing sharding from its design, Solana makes network-wide validation faster, and potentially more secure in the long-run.\n\nThe Solana blockchain has the potential to match a platform like Visa, without any sort of centralized system. The non-linear architecture that Solana employs may force other blockchain developers to rethink linear blockchain systems, due to their inherent limitations.\n\nProof of History (PoH) protocol is an interesting way to remove the problem of time from a blockchain, and the system that Solana may be successful in creating a global relative time standard for decentralized blockchain operations."
