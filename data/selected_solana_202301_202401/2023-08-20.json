        "content": "Nine crypto companies raised a collective $158 million in fresh funding this week, with ZetaChain being a top performer among them.\n\nThe blockchain developer put $27 million on the board with participants in the round including Blockchain.com, Jane Street Capital, Human Capital, Vy Capital, GSR.\n\nZetaChain is an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible layer-1 blockchain, and its team wants to get away from bridges and wrapped tokens. Instead, it wants to move towards a simpler, more interoperable future for crypto, according to a press release.\n\nZetaChain allows users to have access to their wallet\u2019s assets and data on a single platform irrespective of the blockchain. Even Bitcoin and Dogecoin are interoperable, despite being non-smart contract chains.\n\nRead more: ZetaChain announces $27M raise in latest funding round\n\nAnother layer-1 blockchain, Linera, raised $6 million in its latest seed round, bringing the total raised to $12 million. Borderless Capital led the round with a16z, Laser Digital Ventures, Matrixport, Flow Traders, and GSR Markets participating.\n\nLinera was created in 2021 by former Meta engineer Mathieu Baudet. Baudet is trying to increase scalability through \u201cmicrochains.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Linera system scales by adding chains, not by increasing the size or the production rate of blocks,\u201d according to a press release.\n\nThe microchain model \u201cgrants each individual user their own lightweight chains, which integrate into browser extensions or mobile devices for streamlined Web3 app interactions within their wallets.\u201d\n\nWith the new funding, Linera has quite a few plans. The project expects to expand its team, launch a devnet and a testnet, and make their mark in the APAC region.\n\nBitGo pulls nine figures\n\nBitGo made a $100 million splash this week. The crypto custody firm is now valued at $1.75 billion after its series C round.\n\nThat valuation is significantly higher than the $1.2 billion Galaxy Digital almost shelled out to acquire BitGo before backing out of the deal in August 2022.\n\nBloomberg broke the news first on Wednesday morning. While BitGo CEO Mike Belshe chose not to disclose the identities of the investors in this recent round, he did mention that the supporters were from both the US and Asia, with some having no ties to the crypto sector at all.\n\nBloomberg reported that BitGo\u2019s previous investors included Goldman Sachs, DRW Holdings and Galaxy Digital Ventures.\n\nOther notable fundraises\n\nMetaverse creator ZTX closed a $13 million seed round led by Jump Crypto with participants Collab+Currency, Parataxis and others\n\nDinari secured $7.5 million to build a decentralized trading platform for tokenized securities. The product will not be available in the US.\n\nElectric Capital led a $3.3M seed round for Ellipsis Labs with contributions from Robot Ventures, Anagram and notable angel investors including Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko, Polygon\u2019s chief Marc Boiron and Keone Hon, CEO of Monad Labs.\n\nShuttle Labs raised $2.3 million to build a blockchain explorer called Lore. Shuttle seeks to dethrone Etherscan as the most popular cataloguer of blockchain transactions.\n\nJKLabs locked down $2 million in pre-seed funding to change how governance works in crypto.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "News for SEI project airdrop - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we take a look at the recent launch of the SEI crypto and the airdrop released to early users of the blockchain.\n\nAll those who have used the layer-1 testnet and some active users in the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Solana, Polygon and Osmosis networks are eligible to claim the airdrop of the SEI token.\n\nDespite the free cryptocurrencies, many community users have shown their disappointment to the SEI team for a token airdrop in which Binance traders benefited more than ecosystem supporters.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details below.\n\nWhat is the Sei crypto project\n\nThe Sei crypto project involves an open source layer-1 blockchain whose purpose is to offer users a better infrastructure than other blockchains out there, capable of handling a higher volume of transactions while meeting high security standards.\n\nSpecifically, this L1 Proof-of-Stake handles 200 times the throughput of Bitcoin, 100 times that of Ethereum, and twice that of the very fast Solana chain.\n\nEven in the realm of execution speed we are on other levels since on average a transaction on Sei is executed in 500ms, while it takes about 60 minutes on Bitcoin, 6 minutes on Ethereum and 2.5 seconds on Solana.\n\nSei\u2019s network is based on Cosmos SDK and uses the \u201cCentral Limit Order Book\u201d (CLOB) to handle decentralized finance transactions.\n\nBeing compatible with the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) all dApps that are based on Cosmos can easily land on Sei as well.\n\nOn the interoperability front, the cryptographic network thus seems to be well established, able to open its doors to a myriad of decentralized applications.\n\nAs for CLOB, which is a completely unique innovation in the DeFi field but already present on some CEXs, this method of order optimization manages to match buy and sell prices based on price and time priority.\n\nThe result is transaction optimization and transparency on the slippage front, as well as achieving prevention against frontrun attacks by MEV bots.\n\nOn 15 August, SEI, the native infrastructure token, was officially launched in the mainnet through a launchpool on Binance accompanied by the listing of major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Kucoin, Kraken, Bithumb, Bybit, Huobi and Bitget.\n\nThe chain team, in parallel with the coin\u2019s listing on the exchanges, announced the conduct of an airdrop dedicated to early users of the network in testnet and other active users in other blockchains.\n\nThe Sei Foundation is launching an Airdrop unlike any other \ud83d\udd11https://t.co/yZldlDbPyg \u2014 Sei Foundation (@Sei_FND) August 15, 2023\n\nSEI\u2019s airdrop eligibility criteria: check if you are eligible to receive free crypto\n\nThe much-discussed airdrop of the L1 Sei blockchain provides a set of rewards for two distinct groups of users in the world of decentralized finance.\n\nThe first concerns all those individuals who participated in the \u201cIncentivized Testnet Atlantic 2\u201d event: this is an initiative in which the Six team pushed its community to testnet the crypto network by promising a financial return.\n\nThose who completed all Atlantic 2 tasks and those who were awarded the \u201ctop ambassador\u201d rank got a higher allocation as a reward.\n\nTo redeem the airdrop it is necessary to go to Sei\u2019s official website and click on the \u201crewards\u201d item.\n\nHowever, to check whether you have been selected you must first install the \u201cCompass\u201d wallet and import the account with which you participated in the testent (probably Kepler wallet)\n\nOnce this is done, connect the decentralized wallet and check if you have received a reward: to be safe, connect the Discord account as well.\n\nAnother group of users eligible for the SEI airdrop concerns all those who are considered active users of the Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Solana, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain and Osmosis networks.\n\nIn particular, all users who have processed Wormhole bridged tokens such as arbUSDC, opUSDC, maticUSD, solUSDC as well as those who have used the IBC and Axelar have been rewarded.\n\nAbout 1.5 million addresses were found to be eligible to redeem airdrop tokens, including those who had nothing to do with Sei.\n\nTo check one\u2019s eligibility, it is necessary to go to the official Layer 1 website and click on the \u201cAirdrop\u201d item.\n\nHere again you need to install the Compass wallet and log in with a Sei address since the airdrop is cross-chain: this means that if you have been an active user in one of the networks just mentioned in the past via a MetaMask or Trustwallet, you will get the airdrop on the Compass wallet on the Sei network.\n\nOnce you have connected both of your wallets, by following the directions you will be able to claim the Sei airdrop.\n\nNegative community feedback after the token launch:\n\nThe launch of the SEI token and the associated airdrop for testnet users and active addresses of other layer-1 blockchains triggered a shitstorm against the crypto project team, considering the low rewards and the way it was handled.\n\nThe disappointment of the Sei community was so great that it caused the hashtag #SeiScam, through which many users commented on the disastrous airdrop, to become a trending topic.\n\nIn just over two days since the launch of the decentralized infrastructure, there have already been more than 40 thousand Twitter posts in which this hashtag has been mentioned.\n\nThe users\u2019 disappointment is motivated by two identifiable factors: first, the SEI team preferred to prioritize Binance traders over its own community by launching the token on the exchange before the doors were opened to the airdrop claim.\n\nThis came within 48 hours of the listing on Binance, causing everyone who was ready to withdraw their allocation to lose patience and had to wait two full days.\n\nThose who participated in the exchange\u2019s launchpool, on the other hand, were able to withdraw their bags much more quickly.\n\nThe second reason that led to widespread user anger (and probably the main one) relates to the very low token allocation dedicated to both testnet users and the second group of eligible users.\n\nConsider that those who spent a year of their time testing the Atlantic testnet and reached the Ambassador milestone earned only about 79 SEI, or about $15.\n\nIn general, the airdrop allocation was designed as a mockery of the entire community."
