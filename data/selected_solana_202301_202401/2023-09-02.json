        "content": "MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen has proposed a fork of the Solana codebase for the forthcoming native chain of the decentralised financial project. He said the Solana codebase and not the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) should be the foundation for MakerDAO\u2019s upcoming Blockchain, as it is optimised for building \u201chighly efficient Blockchains.\u201d\n\nThe full re-implementation of the Maker protocol into a new stand-alone Blockchain will take place during the final phase, which is anticipated to take about three years to complete. The fifth and last stage of the MakerDAO \u201cEndgame\u201d upgrade, nicknamed \u201cNewChain,\u201d was first unveiled in May this year.\n\nChristensen wrote in a September 1, 2023 post on X (formerly Twitter): \u201cAfter some research, I believe the Solana codebase should be considered as the basis for NewChain.\u201d"

        "content": "A sign placed in a yard in Pacific Beach speaks to the feelings many community members have against short-term vacation rentals.\n\nUnpermitted short-term rental units have accounted for most of the reported code compliance violations throughout the North County coastal region, based on a review of records from each city that cover 2018 to midway through 2023.\n\nAs platforms such as Airbnb and Vrbo remain popular, short-term rental regulations have been a priority along the coast from Del Mar to Oceanside.

The city has been beset over the past several years with legal challenges, battles with California Coastal Commission and delays from the Covid-19 pandemic that have prevented passage of a permanent set of regulations. The current law is a temporary forbearance policy that allows properties to operate as short-term rentals if they can prove they were in operation before April 2016.\n\nAccording to city records, reported violations of illegal short-term rentals typically lead to a process of verifying whether the unit really was being used as an STR, and, if so, whether the unit qualifies under the forbearance policy.\n\n\u201cThere has been a long-term tradition of having short-term rentals and vacation rentals,\u201d Del Mar City Councilmember Dave Druker said during a July meeting . \u201cWe want to make sure as we create these ordinances that we understand that is what\u2019s happened in the past. My assumption is that we\u2019re not going to turn around and say that short-term rentals are not allowed, period.\u201d\n\nOceanside\n\nThe city approved an ordinance in 2019 that allows short-term rentals throughout the city, except for in mobile home parks and nonconforming panhandle lots.\n\nOf 1,337 reported violations, 49.5% were classified as \u201cUnpermitted STR.\u201d Some of the other reported violations included 63 reports of excessive occupants, 26 for excessive noise. There were also a little more than 150 cases recorded for either \u201cTOT Reporting Required\u201d or \u201cTOT Account Required,\u201d referring to the transient occupancy tax that businesses including hotels and short-term rentals have to pay.\n\nCarlsbad\n\nCarlsbad allows short-term rentals only within the coastal zone, based on regulations approved by the City Council that took effect in 2015 .\n\nAbout 84% of the 666 reported violations involved illegal short-term rentals, either unpermitted within the coastal zone or operating in the non-coastal zone where they are banned."
