        "content": "Amid the rally in altcoins, Solana SOL/USD emerged as a top performer as investors saw value in the token. In September, Visa announced revolutionizing cross-border payments with Solana. Meanwhile, crypto fund inflows have surged above $1 billion in 2023 led by Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Solana's price jumped 4% in the past hour trading taking the past 24-hour trading gains to around 19%. With a 50% monthly gain, Solana is currently changing hands at $66.53 which marks its highest since the same period last year.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, trading volume surged 12% while market cap swelled by 19%. Notably, market cap since the same time last year has multiplied more than five times, giving it a strong foothold in the crypto space.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Hits New Annual High At $58 \u2014 Analyst Predicts 'Ethereum Killer' Could Skyrocket To $1,000\n\nSeparately, data from the decentralized finance (DeFi) tracking platform, Defi Llama, showed a significant increase in the dollar value of Solana locked in smart contracts, as reported by CoinGape.\n\nTotal value locked since the start of October expanded by $233 million to $557 million. In the past 24 hours, active addresses (130,554) within the Solana deFi sector also increased.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Strong Push For Solana: The rally comes just a day after ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood talked about Solana\u2019s performance this year on CNBC's Squawk Box.\n\n\u201cSolana is doing a really good job. Ether was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin [back] in the day \u2014 that\u2019s how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and [more] cost-effective than Ether,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also mentioned that despite higher downtime on Solana\u2019s network, people are agreeing to put up with it as they want \u201cspeed and cost as their top priority.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Why Are FTX-Linked Wallets Transferring Solana, Despite The Significant Rally?\n\nOther Developments U.S.-based fintech company CFX Labs announced it raised $9.5 million in seed investments to expand its Solana blockchain-based stablecoin payment and remittances network globally, as reported by CoinDesk.\n\nThe CFX Labs\u2019 payment network sends and receives fiat dollars overseas to countries such as India, Mexico and Nigeria using its proprietary stablecoin fxUSD and the Solana blockchain as payment rail for transactions."
