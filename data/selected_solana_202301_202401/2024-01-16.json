        "content": "Solana DEX Aggregator Jupiter Sets Date for Highly Anticipated Airdrop\n\nSolana-based DeFi aggregator Jupiter is set to make waves in the cryptocurrency space with its upcoming token airdrop and meme coin launch. The JUP airdrop, scheduled for January 31, will distribute one billion tokens to eligible Solana DeFi users. Almost a million crypto wallets are expected to receive funds, with allocations determined by factors such as trading volume and platform usage.\n\nJupiter's airdrop is significant because it will distribute a large amount of JUP tokens to users, potentially boosting the token's liquidity and adoption. The airdrop is also part of Jupiter's broader strategy to expand its DeFi offerings and attract more users to its platform.\n\nIn addition to the airdrop, Jupiter will also launch a meme coin next week. The meme coin is not developed by Jupiter and will not be called MEOW, but Jupiter is using the launch as a \"testing ground for our new launch platform.\"\n\nThe meme coin launch is a unique initiative that will provide a testing ground for Jupiter's new launch platform. It is also a way for Jupiter to engage with the broader cryptocurrency community and attract new users to its platform.\n\nRecent airdrops from protocol have caught the attention of the crypto community, with notable ones from the likes of Jito, Celestia and Manta Network.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "The announcement comes about a month after Solana Mobile indicated it couldn\u2019t fulfill all outstanding orders of its first crypto-integrated Android smartphone, named Saga, which sold out in the United States and European Union.\n\nSolana Mobile unveiled plans Tuesday afternoon to release a second crypto-focused phone.\n\nThe new hardware product is cheaper than the first Solana crypto phone and will be shipped in the first half of 2025, according to its website. The successor will be limited to one per person and five per household. CoinDesk first reported on the news of the new phone.\n\nThe announcement comes about a month after Solana Mobile indicated it couldn\u2019t fulfill all outstanding orders of its first crypto-integrated Android smartphone, named Saga, which sold out in the United States and European Union.\n\nAs a result of a limited supply of Saga phones, secondary buyers have been bidding for new, factory-sealed Solana Saga phones between a range of roughly $2,350 and $3,250 on eBay. Solana Mobile initially priced their Saga devices at $1,000, before cutting prices to $599 to help boost sales.\n\nPeople can preorder the new devices now for $450.\n\n\u201cSolana Mobile\u2019s focus is on capturing the overwhelming demand from both users looking for the next wave from Solana Mobile, as well as ecosystem developers looking to support the launch of our successor product,\u201d wrote Solana Mobile spokesperson Megan Enright in an email to Unchained. \u201cThis product will further what we set out to do with the Solana Mobile Saga \u2014 which was to make crypto products and services more accessible to the public by putting Web3 securely in the palms of their hands.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Solana Mobile community manager on Discord, who goes by the screenname Jax, customers waiting for the first Solana hardware device will still receive it, while the new device is a different product than Saga.\n\nThe Saga\u2019s Saga\n\nThe first Solana phone was not an immediate success as the hardware device struggled with sales. However, sentiment changed about the phone when crypto traders learned how each phone contained several million tokens of Solana memecoin BONK, worth more than the phone itself, contributing to its sellout.\n\nOSOM, the smartphone company that built the hardware for the first device from Solana Mobile, said they had \u201cnothing to share at this time,\u201d when asked whether it will make the newly announced cryptophone.\n\n\u201cAlmost overnight, Solana Mobile\u2019s Saga became the most rewarding experience on a phone, ever, and sold out,\u201d Solana Mobile said in its announcement for the new phone on X. \u201cHaving 20,000 Sagas in the community\u2019s hands is a crucial milestone. We now have a community as sizable as some of the largest NFT projects, offering a fertile ground for developers to build and experiment with mobile. But it\u2019s time to aim much higher.\u201d\n\nWith regards to the Saga, Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko told Unchained on Laura Shin\u2019s podcast in December, \u201cWe really needed to hit like, I think 25,000 to 50,000 units to feel like there is a core user base for developers to be compelled to ship applications.\u201d"

        "content": "During the 2021 bull market, Solana saw incredible price gains. Going from $2 to an all-time high of $260 made many investors wealthy. When looking back at this run and attempting to pinpoint some of the causes, Sam Bankman-Fried's (SBF) name pops up.\n\nSBF was an advocate for Solana, creating projects, investing in the token and speaking about it publicly. Many believe that SBF's praise and use of Solana was a major contributor to its huge spike in 2021.\n\nSpecifically, SBF created a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Solana blockchain called Serum. This project allowed users to trade and convert Solana and other tokens on a peer-to-peer exchange. SBF's success with centralized exchange FTX also contributed to Serum's success.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it ?\n\nThe last-standing top crypto exchange without a major security breach offers what now?\n\nHowever, SBF and FTX Trading Ltd. eventually came tumbling down. In early November 2022, FTX became insolvent. As the details became public, it was discovered that SBF was using customer funds for his proprietary trading firm Alameda Research.\n\nThis event was shattering for the crypto community, but Solana was hit particularly hard. Because SBF backed the project, many were hesitant to continue investing, and the price of SOL fell drastically. Within two months of FTX's insolvency, SOL had depreciated by 50%. By the end of 2022, the token was worth less than $10. While other tokens also lost value during this time, SOL's fall from grace was much larger than its peers.\n\nSolana had a strong recovery in 2023. Despite beginning the year at a two-year low, the price reached a new 52-week high of over $125. This recovery was largely because of a handful of new projects and airdrops on the platform. Most notable are the memecoin Bonk (BONK) and the staking platform Jito (JITO). These projects attracted new investors and spurred new interest in SOL.\n\nSOL's recovery makes many wonder about SBF's large position. At the peak, FTX and SBF held more than 60 million tokens, which was more than 10% of the total supply. While the amount of tokens has fallen slightly because of FTX's selling to repay creditors, it still holds over 55 million tokens.\n\nIt is also important to note that FTX has a vesting schedule for the SOL tokens \u2014 it can sell around 1% of its tokens every month. However, in March 2025, FTX will be allowed to sell over 7.5 million tokens.\n\nStory continues\n\nFTX's Solana position currently is worth over $5.5 billion. This is derived from a position of 55.8 million tokens priced at $100.\n\nAt its peak of 60 million tokens valued at $125 per token, the holding would have been worth $7.5 billion. At its lowest, this position would have been worth a mere $600 million in early 2023.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Here's How Much Sam Bankman-Fried's Solana Would Be Worth If FTX Didn't Collapse originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.
