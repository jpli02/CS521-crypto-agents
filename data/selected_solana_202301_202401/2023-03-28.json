        "content": "Succession\u2019s season four premiere earlier this week brought us multiple over-the-top luxe real estate interiors to feast our eyes on, as usual. One eye-catching location was the $83 million mega mansion where the Roy siblings strategized their next move at the start of the episode, and another, where the trio flew to via private jet, was a striking Montecito locale that Robb Report identified as the Peabody Estate, a.k.a Villa Solana.\n\nConstructed in 1914, the palatial stucco home was designed by politician and architect Francis Townsend Underhill for local businessman Frederick Forrest Peabody. From 1958 to 1978, the hilltop estate went on to serve as a headquarters for the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, a policy institute that was visited by the likes of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Henry Kissinger.\n\nIn the show, the estate belongs to Nan Pierce, owner of the fictional media giant Pierce Global Media. Reality isn\u2019t too far off, as the current owner of the historic mansion is former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who bought it for $30.8 million in 2020. The 11-acre property had been on and off the market several times since 2012 when it was priced at $57.5 million\u2013nearly double the sale price it garnered eight years later.\n\nInside, the sprawling 22,729-square-foot abode offers five bedrooms. A separate guesthouse provides an additional two bedrooms and brings the total bathroom count to an impressive 20. At the center of the main house, paned glass doors lead into a spacious atrium featuring clusters of palm trees that soar way above the rooftop. Many of the original details are still intact, including limestone and marble fireplace surrounds and 17th-century French oak paneling lining the parlor. Antique light fixtures, parquet floors, and beamed ceilings abound, while French doors throughout grant access to the arched loggias that line the building.\n\nThe Roys take a call outside of the home in the season four premiere. Courtesy of HBO\n\nBecome a Member Don't miss the AD PRO-exclusive workshop\u2014Photo Finish: How to Showcase Your Project Arrow\n\nBeyond the loggias, the lushly gardened grounds are abundant with greenery, including lots of mature palms, a rose garden, and a plethora of fruit trees, including lemon, lime, banana, fig, and pomegranate. Panoramic ocean, mountain, and city views surround the picturesque plot, which is also dotted with statues and fountains. In addition to a swimming pool, a huge rectangular pond adds to the water views on the property."

        "title": "Best Mexican car brands in 2024 - Opumo",
        "content": "Mexico is, it's safe to say, crazy about motor sports. Witness the wild cheers for Red Bull's Sergio Perez on every lap he completes at his home grand prix in Mexico City, and the huge crowds that turn out for the country's round of the World Rally Championship. Not just that, but Mexico is the second largest car maker in the western hemisphere after the US. Most of the four million cars produced there each year are by familiar multinationals such as VW or Nissan, but an increasing number of homegrown makers are producing a wide range of offerings, from taxi three-wheelers to the most lairy of hypercars. They're all on our list of 8 best Mexican car brands.\n\nBest Mexican car brands in 2024\n\nV\u00fchl\n\nAmbitious road-legal track car V\u00fchl 05 is sole product of this ambitious Mexican start-up car brand, based in Quer\u00e9taro. Low aeroscreen means first requirement for you and a brave passenger is a crash helmet each, if only to avoid encounters with low-flying bees. Aluminium tub cuts costs compared to European-based carbon fibre rivals, 2.0-litre Ford Ecoboost engine provides enough power to impress visitors to the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where the 05 made a much-admired appearance.\n\nZacua\n\nDedicated electric car maker Zacua has designs on pollution and congestion in Mexico's biggest cities. Enter the Zacua MX2 and MX3, which is just like its tiny sibling, except with a coup\u00e8-like profile. Speed isn't the key here, but you'd certainly find your Zacua to be a nippy way of getting around Mexico City. Development was in association with long-established French microcar maker Automobiles Chatenet, and Zacua claims a competitive range of 99 miles.\n\nMastretta\n\nAfter dabbling with minibuses and a kit car based on the Mexican version of VW's venerable original Beetle, Mastretta changed direction with the MXT, a neat mid-engined sports car aimed at both local and overseas markets. Concept, suggested motoring journalists, was not unlike that of Lotus's Elise, with composite body and aluminium-bonded chassis. Power provided by a Ford Duractec engine is rated at 238 bhp, production has still properly to get off the ground.\n\nRon Automoviles\n\nSo far, there's just the two prototypes from these Guadalajara-based performance specialists, but they're prototypes more than impressive enough to make our list. Street-legal R07 looks like what happens when a Caterham meets an Ariel Atom, which is no bad thing, while outlandish RXX is an electrically powered vision of the sports car future with passenger seated behind intrepid driver, a vision that surely has to make it into production.\n\nElfi Motors\n\nCompact battery-powered transport is the offering of Elfi Motors of Veracruz. Four-door Jimmy KR is marketed as \"modern and functional\" and we couldn't describe it better: four doors offer easy access while compact design eschews style in favour of no-nonsense efficiency. Three-wheel Moto Taxi TA3 is motorcycle based, and comes equipped with built-in internal cooling fan and external luggage rack. Who could ask for more?\n\nInferno Automobili\n\nThere is crazy and then there is the frankly bonkers Inferno Exotic Car, as this wild machine is accurately if prosaically named. Nothing else about Inferno's sole offering is mundane however: twin turbo V8 can power the Exotic Car to 245 mph, on Inferno's figures anyway. Just as startling is the zinc-aluminium-silver alloy used in construction, supposedly both very strong and - if reports are to be believed - stretchable. Makes a Pagani look positively ordinary.\n\nKiri\n\n\"Ecology in Motion\" is the catchphrase of Kiri, best known in Mexico for its range of battery-driven motorcycles, until now that is. All-electric Kiri Neta has joined van-based Empress minibus as four-wheel offerings from Kiri. Neta is particularly impressive with looks that recall generic European/Japanese crossover with a little added flair - and fully electric propulsion. No news on sales outside Mexico, yet.\n\nSolana Cars\n\nLong-established Solana Cars - founded in 1936 - doesn't believe in contemporary ideas of mass production. This family-owned company has produced just 42 cars in the 87 years of its existence. Many were track-only specials, some raced by prominent family member Mois\u00e9s Solana who went on to a brief 1960s career in Formula One. Best-known of a limited number of products is Deportivo Series II with looks inspired by the past and the guarantee that you'll never see another.\n\nGet your fix of all things automotive at The Garage."

        "title": "Real Estate Investors Buy Solana NFT Home for $246800 - Blockworks",
        "content": "Interest in tokenized real estate is spreading. All the way to south Texas.\n\nIn the latest indicator of the once-niche sector\u2019s spread, startup Homebase has closed out the tokenization of its first single-family rental property, the company told Blockworks exclusively.\n\nThe McAllen, TX, single-family home was valued at $235,000. Homebase drummed up $246,800 in about two weeks by tokenizing the residence on Solana (SOL) via a smart contract tied to an NFT created for the purpose: \u201cHomebase 1 [The Cardinal].\u201d\n\nThe total amount raised includes $11,800 set aside to \u201cto account for maintenance and other issues,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nHomebase, according to Domingo Valadez, the company\u2019s chief executive and one of three co-founders, spent seven months getting just the legal and compliance details of its real estate offering ready for market.\n\nThe overall effort took a year and involved the regulatory and fiat side of things: filing the SEC paperwork to market security tokens to both retail and accredited investors.\n\nOf the 38 participating investors, 30 were non-accredited, according to the filing. The minimum investment for the sale reported to the SEC was $500.\n\nHomebase spent some time weighing the benefits and drawbacks of various blockchains to host the NFTs and smart contracts. Homebase eventually settled on Solana. The startup supports USDC to allow users to buy tokenized property slices \u201cin one click,\u201d the statement said.\n\nHomebase considered the Ethereum ecosystem, he said, but was put off in part by concerns over ether (ETH) gas fees that were rising.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) was also in contention, according to Valadez, but blockchain bridges that Homebase would have had to employ resulted in funds disappearing for like \u201c15 minutes,\u201d which would have been \u201cespecially scary\u201d for investors new to the sector.\n\nFractionalizing real estate mints potential\n\nValadez, originally from south Texas himself, spent about five years working for Google before leaving to start up Homebase with two additional co-founders in early 2022.\n\nLiving in the pricey Bay Area, Valadez realized something: He \u201cstill couldn\u2019t afford anything in the Bay Area after working at Google for five years.\u201d\n\nIn spite of working tech hours and earning a tech salary, Valadez said buying a property at the time was out of the question. The US housing market has slowed in recent months, with some analysts eyeing an even more dramatic drop in residential and commercial property prices on the horizon.\n\nA number of tokenized real estate initiatives have started to take shape, including Homebase\u2019s first foray into the competitive market. Those maneuvers come as the Federal Reserve has flashed some indicators that it plans to raise interest rates in a more gradual fashion moving forward.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s March rate hike clocked in at a 0.25% increase, which appeared to have been largely already priced in by both traditional and digital assets markets.\n\nBut the Bay Area and other municipal US hotspots remain stubbornly out of reach in terms of price for most, according to Valadez.\n\nThe median February Bay Area home went for a whopping $1,050,000, according to real estate data provider Norada.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nRead more: The Crypto Native\u2019s Guide to Real Estate Investing\n\nHomebase thinks it can provide a viable alternative \u2014 even with real estate prices where they are, by tapping Solana and ensuring compliance with related SEC regulations.\n\nThe end goal is to create a product that makes money and helps homeowners, as well as investors, in the process, Valadez said.\n\nThe mechanics of NFT real estate\n\nHomebase essentially captures a spread on the transaction. The startup put in a small amount of its own capital, which Valadez said was designed to ensure an alignment of financial interest.\n\n\u201cTokenization in real estate is a means of crowdfunding,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see the value in a decentralized future. We see some of the issues in the current financial structures\u2026How do we give more power to individuals when they truly have ownership around their assets?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how, in Valadez\u2019s estimation:\n\nThe Solana tokenization of the McAllen single-family property went live in early March, generating enough demand that a mix of retail and accredited investors filled the Solana order book at the $1,200 average check size in under two weeks.\n\nThere was no lien or mortgage on the property, meaning Homebase didn\u2019t have to work around outstanding debt on the transaction. The owner, as a result, held onto 80% of their equity in the property. Homebase took on a 1% interest, and the remaining 19% now belongs to investors in the tokenized offering.\n\nOf that approximately 19%, half was raised in fiat and the remainder was processed by USDC. A total of 38 investors participated, and a spokesperson said the \u201cmajority were first-time real estate investors and new to Web3.\u201d\n\nThe process resulted in 15 of the 28 backers creating their first Solana wallet, per the company.\n\nHomebase started the process by agreeing to exclusive terms with the rental property\u2019s owner. The startup then spun up an SPV (special purpose vehicle) to market the tokenized equity sale.\n\nInvestors are required to hold on to their NFTs representing their equity interests for at least one year. The process is verified on-chain.\n\nBackers can then freely buy and sell their Solana NFTs on the open market, and underlying smart contracts tie those transactions to their corresponding equity stakes in the home.\n\nHomebase\u2019s \u201coperating agreements say that non-fungible tokens represent ownership of that SPV,\u201d Valadez said, adding that that way \u201cyou don\u2019t have to get a lawyer involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way we\u2019re marketing this on the demand side is keep all of your assets on-chain and get to invest in rental properties that are truly able to accrue in value,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the homeowner\u2019s side, it\u2019s an additional option you have when it comes to liquidity \u2014 especially in today\u2019s environment, when interest rates are like 6%\u2026[You now have] an additional potential stake to get equity out.\u201d\n\nHomebase\u2019s second tokenized offering is already in the works.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
