        "title": "Solana Price Poised To Surge Nearly 100% in January - Here's Why - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nStory Highlights Solana\u2019s notable returns of 70.6% in 2023 suggest the potential for a surge in SOL value.\n\nSolana\u2019s exceptional transaction throughput of up to 65,00 TPS and low fees of $0.00025 per translation attract investors.\n\nJanuary is pivotal for Solana, with average and profitable returns of 70.4% and 70.6%, respectively, in 2021 and 2023. This trend has played out in both years, with SOL experiencing significant gains of 140.2% and 182%.\n\nIn 2022, the token experienced a decrease of 41.6% by the end of the month. While this historical pattern raises speculation about a potential surge in Solana\u2019s value, there is caution that the sample sizes of three instances may be too small to draw concrete conclusions based solely on price history.\n\nSolanas Exceptional Transactions Throughput and Low Costs\n\nSolana\u2019s exceptional transaction output and low costs have made it a standout player in the crypto space. The blockchain network can process up to 65,00 transactions per second (TPS) with average fees of $0.00025 per transition.\n\nThis makes it one of the fastest and most cost-effective networks. In comparison, Ethereum can only proceed at around 15 TPS with an average fee of $35 per transaction during peak periods.\n\nRecently, Solana surpassed XRP (XRP) in market capitalization. SOL gained over 30% in December, surpassing all other prominent cryptocurrencies in the same period.\n\nAll Eyes on Solana as Potential Surge Looms\n\nThe outcomes remain uncertain, adding an air of suspense to the SOL, which could reach new highs due to growing demand for dApps on Solana Network. Some believe that market conditions may not be favorable for a massive surge in value.\n\nTime will only answer whether SOL will continue its impressive performance or experience another dip in value like it did in 2022."

        "title": "This Solana Developer Just Cashed Out 100K SOL for Reporting a Bug - Coinfomania",
        "content": "A Solana developer who was rewarded with 100K Solana tokens last two years for identifying and reporting a bug in the network has just cashed out $1.5 million. This individual earned this prize from Solana\u2019s bug bounty program for his contribution to the blockchain.\n\nWhat is the Solana Bug Bounty Program?\n\nIn an attempt to ensure the network\u2019s robustness and security, the Solana Foundation has a bug bounty program for hackers who can uncover vulnerabilities such as theft of funds without user signatures, unauthorized fund transfers, or vote program exploits that drain delegated stakes in the network.\n\nThe bounty program has different categories including DoS attacks, loss of funds, consensus /safety violations, and liveness/loss of availability. The rewards range from $100,000 to $400,000. It is worth noting that the reward is paid in SOL tokens with a lockup period of 12 months. Additionally, there is a well-defined process for reporting, reviewing, and addressing the security issues.\n\nAcknowledging that their network is not immune to attacks, Solana said that this program was designed to actively encourage white hat hackers to scrutinize the blockchain for vulnerabilities, and therefore proactively address any issues that might arise.\n\nThe Developer\u2019s Reward\n\nTaking to X (formerly Twitter) in December 2022, the developer disclosed a 100K bounty reward he got from the Solana network for executing a denial of service (DoS) attack against the network.\n\nIn an update today, the developer revealed he has unlocked the bounty after the 12-month vested period. His reward of 100K SOL currently sits at $1.5 million.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time a bug bounty reward has been given to someone for identifying a bug in a network. In 2022, Port Finance, a Solana-based lending protocol, paid out a $630,000 bounty to a white hat hacker for his contribution to preventing a potential $25 million vulnerability from the platform,\n\nThe Solana bounty program aimed at identifying and rectifying potential security threats reflects the network\u2019s continuous effort to uphold integrity and ensure a secure blockchain environment for its users and developers.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana (SOl) trades at $104.86 at press time, representing a slight 0.12% decrease in the last 24 hours."

        "title": "Can Polkadot outshine Solana and Avalanche in 2024? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "DOT might witness a resistance near the $8.6 mark in the coming days.\n\nPolkadot was down by 13% in the last seven days, and indicators looked bearish.\n\nPolkadot [DOT] is swiftly making its way on the list of the top 10 cryptos by market capitalization, thanks to its price gains. Apart from DOT, Solana [SOL] and Avalanche [AVAX] also displayed promising performances in the recent past.\n\nHowever, things for DOT looked better than the rest of the two, if the latest data is to be considered.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s price to skyrocket in 2024?\n\nPolkadot registered a massive uptick in its price during the last month of 2024. As per CoinMarketCap, DOT was up by more than 48% in the last 30 days.\n\nAt the time of writing, DOT was trading at $8.13 with a market capitalization of over $10 billion.\n\nBecause of the bull rally, DOT managed to become the 11th largest crypto by market cap. Apart from Polkadot, SOL and AVAX also registered promising gains during the same time.\n\nBut Tony, a popular crypto analyst, pointed out that while the latter two had a few resistance levels to witness, DOT had a clean way ahead as it was yet to reach its first resistance level.\n\n#Polkadot $DOT the bull run has only just begun Compared to $AVAX and $SOL$SOL has reached the second resistance$AVAX has reached the first resistance$DOT has not yet reached first resistance As we can see #DOT has a longer run and is a better buy because of the bullish run pic.twitter.com/yT3kSwHAvk \u2014 Tony \u20bfitcoin\u26a1 (@Toni_Bitcoin) December 31, 2023\n\nTherefore, to better understand whether DOT\u2019s way ahead is simple, AMBCrypto checked Polkadot\u2019s liquidation heatmap. Our analysis found that things were more complicated than they appeared at first glance.\n\nThe token witnessed a massive increase in liquidation near the $9.2 mark, after which its price started to drop. Polkadot\u2019s liquidation then increased when its value reached $8.6, causing a further price plummet.\n\nHence, DOT must go beyond these levels to initiate a bull rally in 2024.\n\nHow likely is it for DOT to start a bull rally?\n\nDespite the hike in DOT\u2019s price last month, its price action has turned bearish in the recent past. This was evident from the fact that DOT was down by 13% in the last seven days.\n\nHowever, the good news was that while the token\u2019s price dropped, its Open Interest also fell. Whenever Open Interest drops, it increases the chances of a trend reversal, suggesting a price uptick.\n\nIt was interesting to note that while DOT\u2019s price sank, its funding rate remained high, reflecting its popularity in the derivatives market.\n\nRead Polkadot\u2019s [DOT] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nUpon checking DOT\u2019s daily chart, AMBCrypto found quite a few bearish indicators. For instance, Polkadot\u2019s price touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands at press time. Its MACD also dilated into a bearish crossover.\n\nDOT\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved southward, increasing the chances of a continued downtrend in the days to follow."

        "title": "Solana Price Prediction 2024: Will SOL Price Cross $200? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Solana Price Prediction: Amid the current indecisiveness in the crypto market, the Solana price entered a new correction phase after reverting from the 2023 high of $126.36. Within a week, the altcoin\u2019s value dropped 26% to find suitable support at the $96-$100 mark. This support coinciding with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level creates a suitable platform for buyers to regain strength for the next leap.\n\nIs Solana Price Heading to $200?\n\nThe Solana price forms a narrow range above $100 in an attempt to find stability amid correction.\n\nWith a strong fundamental and technical outlook, the SOL price is likely to surpass the $150 mark.\n\nThe 24-hour trading volume on the Solana coin is $1.19 Billion, indicating a 19% gain.\n\nOver the past four months, the Solana (SOL) market performance has been remarkable, witnessing a surge from a mid-September low of around $17.3 to a new high of $126.2. This represents a substantial 626% increase. This surge places Solana as the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at about $46.2 billion\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe rebound in Solana\u2019s value can be linked to several key developments within its ecosystem, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Additionally, the emergence of its meme coin, BONK, and the launch of the Solana Saga Phone have played significant roles. These elements have not only enhanced Solana\u2019s visibility but also fostered broader adoption. This has led to an uptick in fundamental network activities, such as an increase in the number of coin holders and greater whale accumulation.\n\nPresently, SOL is experiencing a corrective phase, aiming to maintain its value above the crucial support level of $100 and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. This correction is seen as a healthy and normal part of the market cycle, suggesting a continued bullish outlook. It is anticipated that this dip will consolidate buyers and potentially propel the currency to new heights.\n\nIn the latest trading session, the Solana price saw a 5.5% intraday increase, forming a morning star candlestick pattern and trading at around $107. If SOL manages to surpass the immediate resistance level of $107, it could pave the way for a retest of the $126 mark, potentially indicating a more substantial recovery.\n\nAnalyzing the daily chart reveals that Solana\u2019s recovery trajectory resembles a rounding bottom pattern. This pattern often indicates gradual accumulation, which could potentially drive the price toward the neckline resistance at $260, marking a new phase of growth for the cryptocurrency\n\nIs SOL Price at Risk Of Heavy Sell-off?\n\nConcerning the Solana price downtrend from November 2021 to December 2022, the current recovery has managed to reclaim a 38.2% loss as per the Fibonacci retracement tool. For the asset to gain better confirmation of a sustainable uptrend, the buyers must break past 50% which is at the $134.3 mark. This breakout will give better confirmation of buyers gradually gaining control over this asset, making it susceptible to sudden sell-offs.\n\nMoving Average Convergence/Divergence: A bearish crossover between MACD (blue) and Signal(orange) hints a corrections sentiment is active.\n\nExponential Moving Average : The 20-day EMA dynamic support acts as a safety net for strong bullish momentum.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "Solana Price Prediction as $2.2 Billion Trading Volume Comes In \u2013 Can SOL Overtake Binance Coin?\n\nThe Solana (SOL) bulls are regaining control as trading volumes start picking up again at the start of 2024.\n\nAs per data presented by Yahoo Finance, $2.2 billion in spot SOL/USD trading volumes changed hands on Monday, up sharply from the low volumes of around $1.7 and $1.8 billion seen over the past two days, as SOL\u2019s price pushes back towards $110.\n\nSOL was last around $108, up around 4% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap, and eyeing a run back towards December\u2019s multi-quarter highs at $125.\n\nSolana was a star performer in December, gaining over 70% amid a surge in meme coin trading and airdrop hunting on the blockchain, which helped pump bullish narratives around the blockchain\u2019s ability to rival Ethereum thanks to its innovative technology, super fast transactions and low fees.\n\nSolana traders, just like broader cryptocurrency market participants, will be monitoring themes this like such as the potential approval in the US of spot Bitcoin ETFs, upcoming US macro data (namely the December jobs report out on Friday), and will be keeping an eye on Solana on-chain metrics to see whether the latest growth in activity is showing any signs of slowing.\n\nSolana Price Prediction \u2013 Can SOL Overtake Binance Coin (BNB)?\n\n\n\nSolana currently has a market cap of just under $47 billion, versus Binance Coin (BNB)\u2019s market cap of around $47.5 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s a very meagre gap to close, and one that Solana, prior to last week\u2019s pullback from multi-quarter highs, has already closed in recent memory.\n\nIndeed, Solana briefly became the fourth largest cryptocurrency in the world last week, behind only Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Tether USD (USDT) as its price peaked around $125.\n\nArguably, Solana stands a very good chance of overtaking BNB once again, given the former strong bullish momentum, and given the latter\u2019s very weak momentum.\n\nBNB was a laggard in 2023, gaining less than 30% over the course of the year versus Bitcoin\u2019s gain of over 160%, Ether\u2019s gain of around 100% and Solana\u2019s stunning gain of around 1,000%.\n\nThe aforementioned bullish narratives surrounding Solana\u2019s use case and potential to rival the likes of Ethereum and Bitcoin are likely to continue contributing to growing interest in the blockchain, at a time when BNB is struggling to benefit from any bullish narratives of its own.\n\nMany crypto enthusiasts have long been skeptical of the BNB\u2019s reliance on crypto exchange Binance (who developed and launched it and has been marred by legal issues in 2023), while some have derided its lack of innovation.\n\nPerhaps BNB is overdue a catch-up to the rest of the market, but the momentum is with Solana, which remains odds-on to steal the number four spot in the crypto rankings.\n\nSolana price predictions are likely to remain bullish as traders eye a retest of April 2022 highs in the $140s.\n\nSOL Alternative to Consider \u2013 Meme Kombat ($MK)\n\n\n\nWhile Solana (SOL) could offer good upside prospects for the months ahead, traders should always look to diversify their crypto holdings.\n\nFor those with a strong risk tolerance, investing in promising up-and-coming web3 project by buying into their token presales is one good way to generate potential quick exponential gains.\n\nCryptonews.com spends a lot of time analyzing which presales have potential, and one such project that they are big fans of is an exciting new project called Meme Kombat.\n\nMeme Kombat blends together the world of crypto gaming and gambling with its exciting platform where users are able to bet on the outcomes of exciting battles between characters based on some of the crypto world\u2019s most popular meme coins.\n\nEarly $MK investors can also benefit from generous staking rewards, which are currently more than 100% annually.\n\nThe project has already raised close to $5.25 million, despite launching just weeks ago.\n\nVisit Meme Kombat Here\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.
