        "content": "Solana Beach experienced an overall decrease of crime over the last year, but there was also an increase in burglary involving mostly commercial properties, according to a presentation that a San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s captain made at Solana Beach City Hall Jan. 10.\n\nCaptain Christopher Lawrence told City Council members that overall crimes against persons decreased by 11%, including a 12% decrease in assault; overall property crime decreased by 15%, including large drops in vehicle theft. Lawrence said there were only six catalytic converters stolen over the last year, compared to 20 the year before.\n\nLawrence said that the use of license plate readers has helped the sheriff\u2019s department in reducing crime in all three north coastal cities. The Solana Beach City Council voted about one year ago to allow the sheriff\u2019s department to use license plate readers within the city, joining several other North County cities that had already authorized the technology. License plate readers have helped improve law enforcement, but have also raised privacy concerns.\n\n\u201cAll three cities experienced a reduction in all their types of crime this year, and it\u2019s heavily related to the use of our LPRs and the investigative tactic that provides us in the backend of these cases,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nLawrence added that shoplifting by \u201ctransitory\u201d criminals has also been an area of concern.\n\n\u201cSome of the crime that we\u2019ve seen as it relates to our shoplifting is related to organized crime, groups that are operating out of Los Angeles and Orange County,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cMany of the criminals that operate in this city can\u2019t and don\u2019t live here, they can\u2019t afford it here.\u201d\n\nOn the roads, there were 34 collisions documented by the sheriff\u2019s department, including three involving a bicycle. There were also 17 DUI arrests and seven DUI collisions.\n\nLawrence said that areas of focus for the sheriff\u2019s North Coastal Station include retail theft operation, traffic safety and safe cities campaign."

        "content": "Solana Price Prediction: The fifth largest cryptocurrency, Solana, enters a new correction phase in a falling channel to test the 50-day EMA. With a solid support trendline in action supported by the crucial support of Fibonacci levels and EMA, the reversal chances for the SOL price trend are heightened. Will these support levels refuel the bullish momentum in Solana?\n\nShort Correction prepares SOL for a bullish breakout\n\nThe Flag pattern formation hints temporary correction in SOL price\n\nA positive alignment in daily EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) indicates the market sentiment remains bullish\n\nThe 24-hour trading volume on the Solana coin is $2.58 Billion, indicating a 2% loss.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the overhead supply at the $127 level led to a quick drop in the Solana price, evaporating almost 25% of its market cap. The bearish-influenced price trend forms a falling channel pattern in the daily chart, leading to a third drop within the channel.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, the active buyers are absorbing the supply quickly at levels under $90, leading to lower price rejection candles. This increases the possibility of a bullish reversal with a double-bottom pattern formation or a bullish reversal within the flag pattern.\n\nFurther, the correction phase retests the 38.20% Fibonacci level for the second time, and the drop in trading volume accompanies the price fall. Hence, the lack of selling pressure increases the chances of buyers regaining trend control.\n\nHence, a potential bounce back in the SOL price can rechallenge the overhead resistance trendline.\n\nWhich Levels Can Solana Reclaim?\n\nWhile the short-term correction is in motion for Solana, the falling channel in Solana projects a weakness amidst the prevailing price trend. Therefore, the ongoing buying at the lower levels may soon catalyze a bullish comeback in Solana.\n\nIf the SOL price breaks above the $100 mark, the bullish trend may face crucial resistances at the $120 and $150 mark. However, a quick correction below the 38.20% Fibonacci level would start a downfall to the $72 mark.\n\nRelative Strength: The daily RSI slope resists a drop below the 50% line, with an uptick reflecting bullish fightback.\n\nExponential Moving Average: The 50-day EMA provides dynamic support to the recent drop and coincides with the 38.20% Fib level to cement the base.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Solana Price Prediction: Make or break moment as SOL runs back to the trend line with falling TVL - FXStreet",
        "content": "Solana price pullback since late December has seen the altcoin retrace the ascending trendline.\n\nSOL could drop 7% to test the $89.02 support level, which is critical to determining the next directional bias.\n\nThe odds favor the downside, witj a dwindling TVL accentuating the falling momentum.\n\nSolana (SOL) price has been on an uptrend since mid-October, outperforming most tokens, especially Ethereum after the ETH versus SOL narrative resurfaced. However, the bullish streak for SOL has run out and now it is on a bearish momentum like most altcoins.\n\nAlso Read: Solana meme coin Bonk Inu price defies ETF FUD and rallies 22%\n\nSolana price at an inflection point as TVL drops\n\nSolana (SOL) price is at an inflection point, recording yet another downtrend while the ascending trendline support continues to hold. Amid falling momentum, a break and close below the trendline could send SOL to a cliff, as its Total Value Locked drops.\n\nBetween January 11 and 13, SOL TVL has dropped from $1.417 billion to $$1.333 billion, representing a 10% drop in two days. This points to money flowing out of the SOL ecosystem, accentuating the bearish outlook.\n\nSOL TVL\n\nSolana price outlook\n\nWith the Solana price trading within the lower half of the Bollinger indicator, bound between the centerline at $103.09 and the lower band at $88.92, momentum dropping, could extend the fall.\n\nThis could see Solana price extend a leg lower, first losing the support offered by the horizontal line at $89.02 before testing the lower band of the Bollinger indicator. A break and close below this level would confirm the downtrend.\n\nThe ensuing selling pressure could see Solana price retrace the $80.00 psychological level, standing 13% below current levels.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart\n\nNevertheless, the bulls maintain a strong presence in the SOL market, evidenced by the green histogram bars in the positive territory. Moreover, the Average Directional Index (ADX) indicator continues to flatten, with the slope reducing to show the prevailing trend is losing steam. A retest of the trendline could trigger a bold bounce with the trendline holding, akin to what happened on January 7.\n\nIf the support offered by the confluence between the ascending trendline, the lower band of the Bollinger indicator, and the horizontal line around $89.02, the bulls could still recover in a bold attempt to salvage Solana price.\n\nEnhanced buying pressure could see Solana flip the centerline of the Bollinger into support above $103.09. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extend for SOL market value to ascend beyond the $112.38 blockade, or higher, tag the upper band of the Bollinger indicator at $117.27. In a highly bullish case, the gains could see the purported Ethereum killer extend a neck higher to the $126.36 range high, levels last seen on Christmas day."

        "title": "Will The Price Of Solana Rise In 2024? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "2017: The Dawn of Solana\n\nIn 2017, Solana emerged as a scalable blockchain platform designed to support high-performance decentralized applications (dApps). Its native token entered the market at an initial price of around $0.50 per coin. Despite limited initial recognition, Solana\u2019s innovative approach to blockchain technology laid the foundation for its future growth and development. It provided a new proof-of-history consensus mechanism.\n\n2018: Building Momentum\n\nDuring 2018, Solana worked diligently to build momentum within the blockchain community. SOL prices fluctuated between $0.20 and $1.00 per token as the project focused on developing its infrastructure and attracting developers to build on its platform. A major selling point was its high speeds and low fees as compared to Ethereum.\n\n2019: Mainnet Launch\n\nIn 2019, Solana achieved a significant milestone with the launch of its mainnet. Prices surged to over $2 per SOL as the project gained traction among developers seeking a high-performance blockchain platform. Solana\u2019s innovative consensus mechanism and low transaction costs appealed to users looking for scalable solutions for decentralized applications.\n\n2020: DeFi Integration\n\nThe year 2020 marked a period of integration for Solana within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Prices climbed to over $4 per SOL as the project became increasingly integrated with various DeFi protocols. Solana\u2019s high throughput and low latency made it an attractive option for DeFi applications, driving demand for its native token. In 2020, Ethereum gas prices were extremely high.\n\n2021: Explosive Growth\n\nLike all tokens, Solana experienced explosive growth in 2021. Prices soared to over $200 per token, propelled by the rapid expansion of decentralized applications and the growing popularity of the Solana ecosystem. The project\u2019s ability to handle thousands of transactions per second and its low fees positioned it as a leading competitor in the blockchain space.\n\n2022: The Post-Boom Price Decline\n\nAfter the rapid ascent of the previous year, Solana declined in 2022. Prices retraced to around $50 to $100 per SOL as investors took profits and market sentiment shifted. However, Solana\u2019s fundamentals remained strong. It continued to make a huge number of market partnerships. Like the wider market, it took a hit after the 2022 FTX collapse with its link to Sam Bankman Fried.\n\n2023: Resilience and Innovation\n\nSOL would be one of the most successful tokens of 2023. While retracting to around $20 and staying there for most of the year, it rose in prominence during the final quarter. In December, its price would rise beyond $100. This is puzzling to many analysts who suggested that the ecosystem would go bust after negative press surrounding FTX.\n\nA Bright future\n\nOn a yearly basis, Solana was a top-performing coin in 2024. Trading at ~$20 in mid-2021, it would rise above $200 by Q1 2024. In April, it could retract to ~$150, but this is still a very strong performance. Many analysts contend that Solana-based meme coins are what contributed to its price rise in 2024, not project fundamentals."

        "title": "Forget XRP: This Crypto Could Be Unstoppable in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Unlike XRP, Solana has a number of high-upside growth catalysts in place for 2024.\n\nAt the end of December, Solana (SOL -0.53%) flipped XRP (XRP 1.33%) to become the fifth-most valuable cryptocurrency. This capped off an impressive run for Solana in 2023. At one point, Solana was up more than 1,000% for the year.\n\nAll this has me thinking it's finally time to forget about XRP. The former crypto market darling is still bogged down in litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Until that regulatory matter is cleared up, XRP shows no signs of breaking through the $1 price level. Contrast that to Solana, which now seems to have a very bright future ahead of it. Let's take a closer look.\n\nSolana is on pace to topple Ethereum\n\nThe primary investment thesis for Solana is that it is the new Ethereum (ETH 0.82%). Since 2020, crypto investors have been touting Solana as a potential \"Ethereum killer,\" and that scenario now seems to be finally playing out. While there are plenty of other Layer 1 blockchain challengers out there, Solana seems to be the one with the best chance of displacing Ethereum.\n\nSimply stated, Solana is a faster, cheaper, more efficient version of Ethereum. While Ethereum had to pull off a very complicated technical transformation (known as The Merge) to become an energy-efficient, proof-of-stake blockchain back in 2022, Solana launched right out of the box as a proof-of-stake blockchain. Whether it's transaction processing speed or overall transaction throughput, Solana seems to have the superior technology.\n\nGranted, the \"best technology\" does not always win. There are a lot of other factors to consider, including first-mover advantage and network effects. That's why Solana has taken nearly four years to finally catch up to Ethereum. But the investment narrative around Solana certainly seems to be shifting. A number of very smart investors -- including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest -- now seem to buy into the idea of Solana as a faster, more cost-efficient version of Ethereum.\n\nSolana has some big-time growth catalysts in place\n\nWhile Ethereum has been around longer than Solana, Solana has one thing Ethereum does not: a mobile crypto strategy. First announced back in the summer of 2022, this mobile crypto strategy has steadily been taking shape over the past 18 months.\n\nLast May, Solana finally launched the first-ever mobile crypto phone, the Saga. The goal of the crypto phone was to usher in a new mobile-first approach to crypto. Think about it -- today's smartphones are not crypto-native. They are designed for neither crypto users nor crypto wallets or for buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while waiting in line for a coffee from your favorite barista. So, Solana -- led by a talented team of former Qualcomm (QCOM 4.26%) engineers -- decided to change all that.\n\nThis mobile crypto strategy also includes a mobile payments component. In February 2022, Solana launched Solana Pay, a blockchain-based payment protocol for merchants who want to accept crypto at the point of sale. Again, this builds on a very intuitive idea: Some people want to pay with crypto, and most merchants want to avoid high credit card processing fees. As a proof-of-concept, Solana announced an integration with Shopify (SHOP -1.16%) at the end of August.\n\nYes, of course, these mobile crypto initiatives could absolutely fail. But they are the types of big-time growth catalysts that XRP simply does not have right now. As long as the legal drama with the SEC stretches on (which could be until the end of 2024), it's highly unlikely that XRP will be able to do much of anything in the U.S. market.\n\nAt the same time, the company behind the XRP token (Ripple Labs) is hemorrhaging cash to pay lawyers. According to Ripple executives, these legal costs could wind up being more than $200 million.\n\nBefore you dump all your XRP tokens\n\nWhile I'm highly confident that Solana could be an unstoppable crypto in 2024, there's also a chance that XRP could soar in price this year. Last summer, when XRP scored a major legal win in its ongoing SEC court case, the price of XRP doubled nearly overnight. So, there is upside potential. If you're currently holding XRP tokens, it could be worth waiting to see what develops.\n\nOver a long-term horizon, though, Solana appears to be a far superior investment. As soon as Solana flipped XRP at year-end, that should have been a wake-up call to XRP investors. It's finally time to look for a new crypto champion, and right now, that champion appears to be Solana."
