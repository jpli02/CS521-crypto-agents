        "content": "Now let's ask this: how much money would it take for Solana to overtake Ethereum in terms of value? Solana's Fully Diluted Value (FDV) is around $11bn and Ethereum's is over $220bn, that's approx 1845% more! Solana (SOL) is currently trading at around $21.70, so if this growth were to happen (and ETH's price didn't change at all), then Solana (SOL) would be worth around $320 a coin. However for this to happen we would need to see way bigger adoption as it would take over $200bn of new investment into Solana (SOL) to make this possible, and that isn't on the horizon any time soon as far as we know."

In its final state, Polkadot (DOT) will use a Nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus model to verify transactions. As Polkadot (DOT) operates as a multi-blockchain ecosystem, it can be split into separate layers, with the Polkadot (DOT) relay chain as the core communication layer. The Polkadot (DOT) parachains have their own governance, consensus, and tokens, and with that, Polkadot (DOT) offers an affordable option for developers, giving them the possibility to create networks using a pay-as-you-go model. DOT is the native token of the ecosystem which offers staking incentives and community governance, and is needed to launch parachains or parathreads."

        "title": "Solana going green with real-time data on network carbon emissions - Inside Bitcoins",
        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nWe have been hearing quite a bit recently on the environment and sustainability. It seems that almost every other day some environmental issue is being reported on, but at the same time, we hear about positive developments. One such development comes from a beloved coin among investors, Solana.\n\nThe Solana Foundation stated today that Solana is now monitoring data relevant to its carbon emissions in real-time. It is \u201ca major smart contract blockchain network\u201d that claims it is a first-of-its-kind action. The code that drives NFT projects and decentralized apps (Dapps) is stored in smart contracts.\n\nThey are reporting that starting today, Solana will routinely update a dedicated dashboard with statistics tracking the network\u2019s main environmental indicators, including its network power intensity, energy usage and carbon footprint. The dashboard will be updated only every two weeks, but it gathers real-time data from software placed on Solana validator nodes.\n\nThis is very positive news to all those conscious of the environmental impacts of cryptocurrency. Later in this article, we will discuss other exciting initiatives in this sector, such as the new project Ecoterra, which is currently in pre-sale. For now, let\u2019s see what Solana has unveiled.\n\nThe emissions tracker, created in partnership with carbon data platform Trycarbonara, collects statistics from on-chain data as well as information that was gathered directly from a sample of Solana validators. In comparison to earlier relied-upon estimates, the more detailed data, which monitors each validator\u2019s geographic location and the times they are online and offline, provides a significantly more accurate evaluation of Solana\u2019s energy use.\n\nPolicy Lead Amira Valliani said in an interview with Decrypt,\n\nI would love for this to become an industry standard. We ought to be upfront about how emissions seem. You may choose how you use a chain intentionally if you are aware of what is happening at the blockchain level as a user.\n\nEnormous energy costs\n\nBlockchain networks, which may consume enormous amounts of energy to create new tokens and support on-chain transactions, have long been a contentious topic. It is an often-cited argument by crypto detractors against cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nIn the case of Solana Foundation, which is responsible for the decentralized Solana network\u2019s well-being, they believe that the problem needs to be acknowledged in order for there to be hope in addressing it.\n\nMembers of the foundation believe that by setting an example and being upfront about their network\u2019s climate impact, other networks will follow suit and this will alter how crypto users perceive their relationship to the environment.\n\nFor example, according to recent research, pollution created by software and computers\u2014a sector in which crypto-related outputs play a significant role\u2014accounts for about twice as much pollution as that produced by the whole aviation industry, although maybe being less visually harmful.\n\nHowever, for all cryptocurrency users to have access to such data, most significant blockchain networks will need to actively participate in the disclosure of their carbon footprint. Analysts are able to quantify a blockchain\u2019s environmental effect thanks to publicly available on-chain data. However, without information provided voluntarily by members of specific networks, those estimations may eventually be incorrect.\n\nAccording to Hayagriv Sridharan, co-founder and CEO of Trycarbonara,\n\nThat data is frequently either underestimated or overestimated, but there is never certainty around it. The data will not be as accurate or useful as when we have stronger collaboration, even if we can model any blockchain without its foundation\u2019s help.\n\nThe Proof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake controversy\n\nSridharan is hopeful that further blockchains will emulate Solana and offer such assistance. The fact that users of proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin, which frequently consume far more energy than proof-of-stake networks like Solana and Ethereum, are ready to willingly subject their way of life to more scrutiny by environmentalists, however, might complicate matters.\n\nProof-of-stake blockchains enable validators to validate on-chain transactions and create new cryptocurrencies as a result of their substantial cryptocurrency deposits (or stakes) into the network. Proof-of-work blockchains, on the other hand, demand miners to process transactions by focusing massive amounts of computer power at challenging problems, with winners receiving fresh cryptocurrency.\n\nNot long ago, Ethereum switched from the energy intensive Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nTrycarbonara estimates that a single Bitcoin transaction uses 5.79 million times as much energy than a proof-of-stake Solana transaction. The difficulty of these puzzles\u2014and the energy needed to answer them\u2014is only rising as reward supplies of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin get more and more constrained.\n\nA law limiting Bitcoin miners\u2019 capacity to draw electricity from the unstable Texas energy system during demand surges was approved by the Texas Senate last week. In order to evaluate the harmful environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining, a county in North Carolina is considering a one-year moratorium.\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s successful \u201cmerge\u201d in the fall of last year, which switched the network from its long-standing proof-of-work methodology to proof-of-stake, some of the criticism over the environmental effect of cryptocurrencies has subsided. The Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute estimates that the action reduced Ethereum\u2019s projected carbon footprint by more than 99.99%.\n\nThe larger argument, though, recently resurfaced when a contentious New York Times piece looked at the impact Bitcoin mining has on the environment. The article was criticized as \u201cfalse and misleading,\u201d \u201cpolitically-driven,\u201d and a \u201chit piece\u201d that served as a \u201cmonument of intellectual laziness,\u201d according to the critics.\n\nSome proponents of Bitcoin assert that such studies ignore the volume of renewable energy utilized to mine the currency or what they perceive to be a beneficial effect on grid stability. Other cryptocurrency proponents point out that centralized sectors do not disclose their energy use, making it difficult to make an accurate comparison to, say, the footprint of IT giants or the conventional banking system.\n\nIt is obvious that both sides of the argument still find the subject to be delicate. But a tracker like Solana\u2019s is a start in the right direction for more accuracy and openness in energy reporting in the Web3 era. However, it will be left to individual cryptocurrency users to determine what effect it will have.\n\nEcoterra \u2013 a new green cryptocurrency\n\nIn the area of green cryptocurrencies, a project worth mentioning is Ecoterra, a new presale crypto aiming to solve climate change issues using blockchain tech, \u2018Recycle2Earn\u2019, and carbon credits. This project is one of the best ways to earn free crypto, all while helping the environment.\n\nAs mankind works to lessen the effects of climate change and environmental deterioration, recycling is both an ecological requirement and a financial opportunity.\n\nEcoterra is developing a system to reward recyclers and a system to encourage ecological action actions that benefit our environment in order to assist in achieving those goals.\n\nThe most crucial component of the ecosystem is the recycle2earn app from Ecoterra. Users of the smartphone app have access to the platform\u2019s three primary pillars: the markets for recycled materials and carbon offsets, as well as the impact profile, which tracks ecological acts.\n\nEcoterra\u2019s CEO Mihai Ciutureanu on the Market for Recyclable Materials\u2019 Filtering System\n\nIn a recent AMA on Coinsniper, ecoterra CEO Mihai Ciutureanu gave his audience an explanation of some of the design choices made for the project, how it would operate, and what will be done with the money raised from investors.\n\nMore information regarding the market for recycled materials was given by the CEO.\n\nAccording to Ciutureanu,\n\nThe Recycled Materials Marketplace serves as a platform that connects businesses in need of recycled materials with recycling businesses providing those resources. The marketplace makes sure that the products posted are in line with the precise requirements of purchasers by utilizing a sophisticated screening mechanism.\n\nPayments may be made using other cryptocurrencies or $ECOTERRA tokens, and for better transparency, the purchase history may be linked into a company\u2019s trackable profile.\n\nHe included an explanation of the team\u2019s decision to use the Ethereum blockchain. \u201cIn our opinion, Ethereum is the blockchain that best meets our needs. It facilitates the creation of smart contracts that are suited to our particular needs and is trustworthy and safe.\u201d\n\nThe Coinsniper AMA moderator, Kieran, posed a query that emphasized the significant benefit the initiative offers not just to consumers but also to business:\n\nI work for a top plastic packaging firm, and this is clearly something the industry needs. Most businesses also want it right now because doing so would result in significant tax savings for businesses that employ recycled plastics for packaging.\n\nCiutureanu agreed as one might assume, saying that \u201cpair[ing] with blockchain technology is the greatest approach to link demand and offer [options] for recycled materials.\u201d\n\nLiquidity Pool and Corporate Onboarding Strategy of Ecoterra\n\nCiutureanu continued by providing some further details on the tokenomics used by Ecoterra.\n\nThe ecosystem liquidity pool (LP) balances the $ECOTERRA that comes in from fees and packages that businesses buy with the $ECOTERRA that goes out to reward users of the Recycle2Earn app. For corporate adoption, we will focus on the initial set of businesses and entice them to join our ecosystem by providing free trial packages.\n\nThey will be able to comprehend the workings of Ecoterra\u2019s ecosystem better thanks to this method. The CEO\u2019s discussion of how his team plans to fulfill the roadmap milestones may have been the most crucial.\n\nWhile continuing to work on the other Ecoterra pillars, we aim to release the beta version of the Recycle2Earn app before the end of the year. We are incorporating different brands into the ecosystem in the meantime. We now have Vittel, Heineken, San Pellegrino, and Dr. Pepper included, and we want to add more in the upcoming weeks. In the future months, we will also concentrate on developing collaborations. Our current conversations have produced encouraging outcomes thus far.\n\nPepsi, Fanta, and Peroni are currently being added to the Ecoterra database of recyclables that may be scanned.\n\nThe Ecoterra team has extensive knowledge of the recycling sector, and the initiative has already established a collaboration with the Delhaize (Lion) grocery chain.\n\nReverse vending machines (RVMs)\n\nReverse vending machines (RVMs), a crucial component of the circular economy-aligned recycling system, are offered at Delhaize\u2019s stores across its branch networks in Europe, North America, and Asia. Recycling value machines (RVMs) take recyclables and repay the user. For each item you recycle, you will be able to earn tokens using the recycle-earn Ecoterra app.\n\nPromoting Sustainable Actions and Recognizing Environmental Stewardship: Ecoterra\u2019s NFTs\n\nExperts anticipate more interest in initiatives like Ecoterra that score highly in the environmental, social, and governance categories. To put that into perspective, it may result in an exorbitant return on investment for early purchasers, resulting, at the very least, in a ten-bagger (10x) price for Ecoterra.\n\nWith Ecoterra, all environmental initiatives that a person or business performs are added up to milestone achievement totals that are represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Every activity is measurable and serves as the primary input for the impact profile of each person or business.\n\nBy using NFT technology, environmentally friendly activities like planting trees or eliminating plastic from the environment are made marketable commodities. NFTs, in essence, provide us all more motivation to act in the best interests of the environment.\n\nBy producing renewable energy, you may make money and help the environment. Another fantastic Ecoterra feature is the option to employ renewable power produced by businesses and people to earn $ECOTERRA token revenue.\n\nPre-sale\n\nThe current Stage 4 of the presale has only seven days left. However, as there is only $450,000 left, this level will be sold out much before then.\n\nSince Ecoterra has been selling at a rate of about $200,000 per day on average, Stage 4 may be completely sold out by the weekend. This indicates that the window of opportunity to lock in the present cheap price is getting smaller. In order to lock in the Stage 4 $ECOTERRA token price of $0.0065, prospective investors must act quickly.\n\nThe token price increases by 12% when Stage 5 begins, from $0.00625 to $0.0070.\n\nAs the presale ends, experts anticipate high returns for investors.\n\nAs the presale progresses, the fundraising run rate keeps increasing, and analysts anticipate significant returns on investment for early purchasers of the $ECOTERRA token. There truly is not much time left because the presale has been so successful that it could be completely sold out by the end of April.\n\nInvestors who want to purchase $ECOTERRA tokens must have ETH or the Tether stablecoin (USDT). Those who are not familiar with cryptocurrencies can make purchases using a card and regular \u201cfiat\u201d money.\n\nAfter the presale is over, $ECOTERRA will list on exchanges for $0.01, which is 150% more expensive than Stage 1\u2019s $0.004 pricing and 60% more expensive than Stage 4\u2019s current price.\n\nParticipate in the Pre-sale Now\n\nRelated\n\nSmog (SMOG) - Meme Coin With Rewards Rating Airdrop Season One Live Now\n\nEarn XP To Qualify For A Share Of $1 Million\n\nFeatured On Cointelegraph\n\nStaking Rewards - 42% APY\n\n10% OTC Discount - smogtoken.com Visit Site"
