        "title": "Investing In Zebec Protocol (ZBC) \u2013 Everything You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "Blockchain technology made a promise 13 years ago to revolutionize the way payments work. And, while many were skeptical at the time, these days, we are witnessing that promise being fulfilled in real-time. Of course, we are still very far away from mass adoption, but the number and diversity of all kinds of solutions that are emerging throughout the blockchain industry is really making people believe that there is something to the promises that the blockchain made when Bitcoin first came out.\n\nOf course, the realization of the promise is somewhat different from what was expected back then. Initially, everyone believed that the promise meant that Bitcoin would become a worldwide-adopted currency, legal tender everywhere, and the coin that will be used for all sorts of payments. Today we know that this is not the case and that it cannot be the case. There are too many limitations to Bitcoin, and the project is very slow to change, which is why it is taking on a new role as digital gold.\n\nHowever, there are 19,000 other cryptocurrencies out there at the time of writing, and some of those actually have the potential to change the way payments work. Take Zebec Protocol as an example. It is a continuous settlement protocol that aims to transform things like payroll, cash flow, and token vesting by allowing users to send payments and distributions every second. This got us interested, which is why we decided to take a deeper look into what it has to offer.\n\nWhat Problems Does Zebec Protocol (ZBC) Solve?\n\nFirst, we decided to see what impact can the project have on the world, and what issues it plans to solve with its technology. We found that it does things such as:\n\nEnabling payment streams\n\nZebec is a Solana-based project that acts as a continuous settlement protocol Its goal is to enable the composable transfer of value, starting with its main service called Zebec Payroll. The project is also very user-friendly, and it claims that users can get started in only two steps \u2014 by connecting their wallets and starting the money stream.\n\nEnabling DeFi revolution\n\nOne of Zebec Protocol\u2019s goals is to enable the DeFi revolution. DeFi made a lot of noise when it emerged, and it attracted a lot of people with its promises of earning passive income while helping out other members of the community simply by locking up the tokens they own. However, DeFi can also be applied to change the way things are done in traditional finance, including things like payrolls.\n\nBringing change in the digital economy of Web3\n\nZebec Protocol stands as modular money, layer, which is extensible and upgradeable through governance. Apart from pursuing a DeFi revolution, it also aims to bring change in the WEb3 digital economy by establishing programmable money streaming as a foundation for better, greater, and \u201cmore legendary\u201d financial innovations.\n\nBenefits of Zebec Protocol (ZBC)\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s take a look at some of the benefits that you can personally experience if you decide to join this project.\n\nTreasury management\n\nTo start things off, we have treasury management. Essentially, the project uses multi-signature approach to manage crypto treasury, meaning that you can expect advanced security of funds and that no one can take them away on their own.\n\nInstant and continuous funds streaming\n\nWhen it comes to funds streaming, it is of crucial importance that it continues to flow uninterrupted at all times. This is why Zebec ensures that the funds stream is on a per-second basis and that you have full control over it, with the ability to pause it, resume it, or cancel it at any time.\n\nHigh customization\n\nThe team behind the project understands that different businesses have different requirements, and that there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d when it comes to this sort of thing. This is why it allows you to customize Multisig for all custom workflows, no matter how many of them, or what you need them to be like.\n\nAccess multiple tokens\n\nTreasury management is not only for the project\u2019s native ZBC token, either. In fact, it supports all SPL tokens. In other words, it is compatible with any and all tokens issues on Solana\u2019s blockchain, so no matter which coin or token you prefer, the project will be able to offer services to you.\n\nYield farming and staking\n\nThe project also offers more than just the funds streaming, as it also recognizes the importance of DeFi to individual users. This is why it offers yield farming, where users can allocate some, or even all of their earnings to an investment account and arrange for the funds to be automatically deployed into partner yield farming and staking protocols.\n\nCrypto IRA & 401k Accounts\n\nInvesting in crypto in the long term is one of the best investment strategies there is. This is why many people are choosing to invest in them now, years, or even decades before retirement. Zebec Protocol understands this also, which is why it allows users to stream their payroll to compliant crypto IRA & 401k accounts. Not only that, but they can also easily swap between top cryptocurrencies, which allows them to modify their investment as new coins emerge, or as others become more profitable.\n\nCustom debit card\n\nFinally, the project also understands that users need more than simply the ability to store crypto or be paid in it, which is why it offers a custom crypto debit card that will allow employees to seamlessly convert their real-time liquidity to fiat currency and use it in everyday life. At the time of writing, this feature is not yet available, but the project says that it is working on it, and that custom debit cards will be coming soon.\n\nHow Does Zebec Protocol (ZBC) Work?\n\nZebec Protocol is a revolutionary DeFi technology aimed at empowering businesses and their employees alike. It offers real-time, frictionless and continuous streams of payments, where the automatic money streams are made possible via Zebec\u2019s advanced technology.\n\nWith them, businesses, employees, and consumers can completely reimagine the way payments and salaries work, as well as investments, purchases of products, and payments for services. The project\u2019s mission is to allow direct and instant financial transaction settlements between the involved parties, with no needs for intermediaries, but also with no difficulties, long waiting periods, large transaction fees, and alike.\n\nSimply put, it wishes to disrupt the current, traditional financial system and allow DeFi to change the payments world and expand its use cases and reach into traditional finance, instead of existing outside of it.\n\nHow to Buy Zebec Protocol (ZBC)\n\nCurrently, Zebec Protocol (ZBC) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nKuCoin \u2013 This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. This exchange currently accepts International & United States residents.\n\nGate.io \u2013 This exchange was established in 2013, and is one of the more popular & reputable exchanges. Gate.io currently accepts most international jurisdictions including Australia & the UK. USA & Canada residents are prohibited.\n\nHTX \u2013 Established in 2013, HTX has since become one of the world\u2019s largest digital asset exchanges, with an accumulated trading volume of US $1 trillion. It should be noted that HTX currently does not accept USA or Canadian residents.\n\nZebec Protocol (ZBC) \u2014 Multisig treasury management and streaming payments protocol\n\nZebec Protocol is a project that can change the way businesses work and pay their employees forever, but also the things that these employees will do with their money, and how they do it. Whether you wish to use your payments for investments into various coins and tokens, if you wish to deposit them in an IRA account for retirement, or even if you wish to spend it \u2014 the project offers all of this, and more. As such, it can push adoption into the business sector, and help people save time and money by offering near-instant transactions at cheap transaction costs, and alike. We believe that a project like this can go a long way once crypto and blockchain reach mass adoption, which is why entering it now could have positive consequences for the users\u2019 financial future."
