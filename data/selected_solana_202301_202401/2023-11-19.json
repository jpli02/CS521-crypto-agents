        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSOL\u2019s Price Increase : Solana\u2019s (SOL) price recently spiked to nearly $70, prompting discussions about its potential to surpass Ripple\u2019s (XRP) market cap by the end of 2023.\n\n: Solana\u2019s (SOL) price recently spiked to nearly $70, prompting discussions about its potential to surpass Ripple\u2019s (XRP) market cap by the end of 2023. Factors for Market Position : The likelihood of SOL overtaking XRP hinges on the regulatory environment, specifically Ripple\u2019s SEC lawsuit outcome, and the overall crypto community sentiment.\n\n: The likelihood of SOL overtaking XRP hinges on the regulatory environment, specifically Ripple\u2019s SEC lawsuit outcome, and the overall crypto community sentiment. Drivers of Solana\u2019s Surge: Solana\u2019s growth is linked to the broader positive crypto market trend, institutional interest, Coinbase\u2019s SOL perpetual futures listing, and endorsements from industry figures like Cathie Wood.\n\nCan SOL Surpass XRP?\n\nSolana\u2019s native token \u2013 SOL \u2013 has captured much attention lately due to its considerable price increase. It spiked to almost $70 on November 16, a figure last observed in May 2022. Its market dynamics have become a trendy topic among cryptocurrency participants, with some wondering whether an additional rally could be on the cards before the year\u2019s end.\n\nAccording to the AI-powered language model ChatGPT, SOL could continue its uptrend in the remaining months of 2023 and even surpass the market capitalization of Ripple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 should several critical factors be in place.\n\nOne such element is the regulatory environment. ChatGPT estimated that a favorable update surrounding the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC could benefit XRP, meaning it would be tough for SOL to catch up with the pace.\n\nThe overall sentiment across the community is also worth observing. The general feeling of investors toward a certain crypto asset could play a role in its price swings, while positive news and partnerships might also propel a bull run.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s possible for Solana to surpass Ripple in market cap, such an event would depend on a complex interplay of the above factors and others that might emerge. It\u2019s always advisable for investors to conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks involved in cryptocurrency investments,\u201d ChatGPT concluded.\n\nWhat Stands Behind SOL\u2019s Recent Rally?\n\nSolana\u2019s latest ascend could be attributed to the overall green wave in the cryptocurrency market, the rising interest from institutional investors, Coinbase\u2019s interaction, and many other factors.\n\nRecall that the US-based cryptocurrency exchange recently listed SOL perpetual futures on its international exchange and Coinbase Advanced. The service gives clients additional leverage to bet on the token\u2019s price movements. It also makes Solana more accessible to institutional investors globally, who often use Coinbase as a venue to trade digital currencies.\n\nLast but not least, SOL\u2019s surge came shortly after Cathie Wood (CEO of ARK Invest) praised the asset\u2019s merits and described it as \u201cfaster and more cost-effective than Ether.\u201d"

        "content": "Solana has taken the lead in the midst of a bullish market, attracting increased investor interest and defying the odds that the bear market threw at it. Kunal Goel, Senior Research Analyst at MessariCrypto, recently delved into Solana\u2019s tokenomics to unravel its value and potential pathways to further success.\n\nWith Solana leading this bull run and seeing increased investor interest, I take a look at its tokenomics and try to find a value and potential paths to (more) success.\n\n\n\nBut first, huge props to the Solana team and community. With every narrative going against them in the bear\u2026 pic.twitter.com/FPxEYexdl3 \u2014 Kunal Goel (@kunalgoel) November 17, 2023\n\nAcknowledging the Solana team\u2019s and community\u2019s resilience, Goel commended their ability to withstand the challenges of the bear market. Despite narratives working against them, SOL has not only weathered the storm but has emerged stronger, establishing itself as the home for DePIN apps. The platform has also announced several exciting partnerships, including a notable collaboration with Visa, dispelling any lingering doubts over its narrative.\n\nMoving on to evaluating Solana\u2019s value, Goel emphasized the inherent difficulty in valuing Layer-1 tokens but outlined potential scenarios based on specific assumptions.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the cost of transactions is fixed, the analysis reveals that Solana would require an astounding 13 billion non-vote transactions daily or approximately 150,000 non-vote transactions per second (TPS) to achieve a net 0% inflation. However, the current network capacity falls short of supporting such a high transaction volume.\n\nProjecting Solana\u2019s Needs In 2030\n\nLooking ahead to Scenario 2 in 2030, with the launch of Firedancer and a gross inflation rate of 1.5%, Solana would need around 50,000 non-vote TPS to maintain zero net inflation. It, Goel notes, is only achievable through the widespread adoption of high-throughput applications like social media, payments, trading, or DePIN.\n\nAlternatively, the analysis explores the transaction activity required to support different SOL prices at zero net inflation by fixing the fee per transaction in dollar terms. Under Scenario 2 growth (approximately 50,000 non-vote TPS), Solana could potentially support a price of $500. At current activity levels, the platform can sustain a price of $5 with net zero inflation.\n\nAdding to the positive momentum, Santiment reported that Solana experienced another surge in market value over the weekend. Traders successfully pushed prices above $60 for the first time since May 2022, with a noticeable increase in FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). According to Santiment, positivity around $SOL is now at its highest level over a year.\n\n\ud83e\udd73 #Solana has seen yet another leg up in its market value this weekend, and traders have now officially pushed prices above $60 for the first time since May, 2022. $SOL #FOMO has picked up in a big way, with positivity at its highest level in over a year. https://t.co/04Tabsz5Hs pic.twitter.com/uzEG56w6RY \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 19, 2023\n\nRelated Reading | dYdX Deploys $13.5 Million Insurance Fund After $38 Million Liquidation Event"

        "content": "Solana Blockchain Games Thrive on the Epic Games Store \u2013 Next Big Thing?\n\nThe number of Web3 games on the Solana (SOL) blockchain has grown substantially amid the spike in the network\u2019s native token over the past month.\n\nAccording to Game7\u2019s 2023 State of Web3 Gaming Report, the number of crypto games on the Epic Games Store has increased from 10 in January to 69 in October.\n\nThe report also revealed that Solana currently boasts a little over 125 games in its ecosystem, making it the fourth most popular blockchain network for game developers overall and the top non-EVM chain.\n\nThese games encompass a range of genres, from ambitious sci-fi MMOs to fantasy pet battlers.\n\n\u201cSolana remains the largest non-EVM ecosystem of Web3 games,\u201d the report said.\n\nMajor Solana-Based Games\n\n\n\nStar Atlas, a sci-fi MMORPG in development, is one of the many games that has chosen Solana for its tokens and NFTs.\n\nEarly access footage showcases an immersive world replete with massive spaceships, modern structures, and futuristic apparel for its playable characters.\n\nDespite some setbacks, such as the studio behind the game laying off 73% of its team in July, development has been going on.\n\nIn September 2022, a playable demo for Star Atlas NFT holders was released on the Epic Games Store.\n\nAnother Solana-based game, Aurory, a free-to-play fantasy RPG, combines elements of Pok\u00e9mon and the Matrix.\n\nWhile originally releasing its NFTs and AURY token on Solana, the team revealed plans to expand to the Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum in July.\n\nAurory recently announced that its RPG expansion, \u201cSeekers of Tokane,\u201d will be available on the Epic Games Store alongside its native browser version.\n\nSeekers of Tokane promises players limitless lands to explore, expanded battle features, and character customization. Although a firm release date on the Epic Games Store is yet to be announced, it is listed as \u201cComing Soon.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Yaku, a free-to-play social metaverse game, currently supports both the Solana and Ethereum blockchains.\n\nIt is in early access on the Epic Games Store, with a focus on user-generated content and community-driven development.\n\nThe game envisions a dystopian sci-fi environment ruled by the omnipotent mega-corporation Saikou. Yaku plans to gradually release the game world through incremental updates over the next five to seven years.\n\nMoreover, Chain Crisis, described as a free-to-play cyberpunk dystopian shooter set in the fictional near-future world of Warpgate City, is listed on the Epic Games Store as \u201cComing Soon.\u201d\n\nIt has already released male PFP-style avatar NFTs on Solana and intends to offer in-game character cosmetics as NFTs.\n\nFinally, Angelic, a sci-fi RPG, offers multiplayer, co-op, and single-player game modes.\n\nThe Angelic team raised $10 million for the game, with support from Animoca Brands, Pantera, and Solana Capital.\n\nAngelic: Dark Symphony, the single-player campaign mode, is listed as \u201cComing Soon\u201d on the Epic Games Store.\n\nThe developers use Solana and Ethereum for optional NFT elements and have committed to never implementing \u201cpay-to-win\u201d or \u201cplay-to-earn\u201d mechanics, considering such models \u201ctoxic and unsustainable.\u201d"

        "title": "ChatGPT expects Solana to set this price target for 2024 - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nIt has been one month since the crypto price rally began due to speculations around exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Solana [SOL] has achieved one of the most remarkable price surges among all the cryptocurrencies during the ongoing bull run.\n\nSince mid-October, SOL\u2019s price has surged by more than 160%. It was trading at $57.86 at press time.\n\nWe recently witnessed some large-scale whale activity too. On 12 November, for instance, Whale Alert reported two substantial Solana transactions, each exceeding $30 million.\n\nThe first transaction involved the transfer of 325,222 SOL, valued at over $18.6 million, to Binance. The second transfer consisted of 199,998 tokens, valued at over $11.5 million, sent to the Coinbase exchange.\n\nClearly, the token is a major player in the crypto market, attracting a large number of investors. That is why AMBCrypto has looked at Solana\u2019s price fortunes in the past too.\n\nHow it began\u2026 Solana journey\n\nSolana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper in late 2017, describing the proof of history (PoH) consensus mechanism.\n\nSolana combined both PoH and proof of stake (PoS) on its blockchain project. It is critical at this juncture that we understand what both these mechanisms\n\nPoH is a proof for verifying order and passage of time between events, is used to encode trustless passage of time into a ledger. PoS requires validators to stake some of their coins as collateral. The network then chooses a validator at random to construct a new block depending on stake size and other parameters.\n\nBuilt by San Francisco-based Solana Labs, Solana got launched in 2017. The open-source blockchain project is currently run by Geneva-based Solana Foundation.\n\nDisruptive \u201cEthereum killer\u201d\n\nSolana\u2019s launch was a major disrupter in the crypto industry as it challenged the dominance of Ethereum [ETH]. So much so that it came to be known as \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nMuch of the buzz surrounding Solana was due to its distinct advantage over Ethereum in terms of transaction processing speed and transaction costs. Solana can process as many as 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), and its average cost per transaction is $0.00025. In contrast, Ethereum can only handle less than 15 TPS, while average transaction fees are around $1.68.\n\nAs a result, the blockchain network onboarded a large number of enthusiasts.\n\nAccording to on-chain analyst Patrick Scott, Solana\u2019s DEX volume has been skyrocketing in recent days. He also referred to the recovering Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nDEX Volume on Solana exploding the past few days. Important to note that Solana's volume over the past 24 hours has been nearly 3X its total DEX TVL ($424M vs $153M). In comparison, other major chains have less 24 hour volume than TVL. High volume/TVL should push fees higher,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6Q0XkQsmvU \u2014 Patrick Scott | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) November 3, 2023\n\nRyan Sean Adams, co-founder of the Bankless VC fund, meanwhile criticized its relatively smaller TVL in comparison to other L2 blockchains.\n\nBut Helios CEO Mert Mumtaz quickly dismissed Adam\u2019s take. Mumtaz said TVL was a \u201cnoisy\u201d metric. He also pointed out that SOL easily trumped Ethereum when it came to TPS.\n\nRyan, you have absolutely no idea what you're doing lol TVL and active addresses are easily gamed, noisy metrics \u2014 especially in the context of people who farm L2 airdrops Solana does more TPS than all those combined while being 100x cheaper and having a much larger community \u2014 mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) November 3, 2023\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nHas Solana managed to contain its outages??\n\nHowever, the network was notorious for its outages. But the team worked on resolving this persistent issue. The team claimed in July to have not suffered any outages since February.\n\nFyi there's a $400k reward for anyone that can find code that can turn off Solana Please go ahead and find ithttps://t.co/2oxcB0EEyx \u2014 Jacob Creech (@jacobvcreech) October 12, 2023\n\nIs Solana a security?\n\nEven as Solana is touted to be the \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d Yakovenko seemed to be in agreement with the idea of using Ethereum as an L2 blockchain for Solana.\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security. In this setup, holders of solana assets on ethereum would have finality guarantees that they can exit back\u2026 https://t.co/XE5ETsxGIW \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nEven Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is an admirer of Solana. When the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance and Coinbase in early June, it labeled several altcoins, including SOL, as securities.\n\nButerin rued the manner in which the regulator was targeting projects like Solana.\n\nThe one comment I'll make is that I feel bad that @solana and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don't deserve it, and if ethereum ends up \"winning\" through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that's not an honorable way to win, and in the long term\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 30, 2023\n\nAt this point, we decided it\u2019s a good time to ask ChatGPT about different aspects of Solana. ChatGPT has proven to be valuable for traders and analysts.\n\nAt first, ChatGPT wasn\u2019t able to provide any details. So I decided to educate and jailbreak it.\n\nI asked ChatGPT if it thought the court would overturn the SEC\u2019s decision to classify Solana as a security.\n\nWhile the classic version refused to comment on the matter, the jailbroken version gave a rather speculative response.\n\nLooking at Solana\u2019s price movement\n\nSolana emerged as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies within a few years of its launch. In November 2021, it reached an all-time high (ATH) of $250. Its market cap also reached an ATH of $75 billion, making it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the bloodbath last year led to SOL plummeting to as low as $10 in December 2022. It was in November 2022 that FTX [FTT], the monstrously huge blockchain project of Sam Bankman-Fried \u201cSBF,\u201d collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in the U.S.\n\nRemember that SBF was one of the most vocal proponents of the Solana network. The community saw him as a credible and smart entrepreneur who was leading one of the largest crypto exchanges across the world.\n\nThe Solana Foundation had sold a significant amount of SOL tokens to FTX and Alameda Research. This amounted to 58.08 million SOL, or 11% of the circulating supply at the time FTX filed for bankruptcy. The total value of these tokens was estimated to be $1.1 billion at the time.\n\nEarly this month, the court announced its final judgment in the case against SBF, finding him guilty on all the seven counts. The judge set the sentencing date for 28 March 2024; SBF could be sentenced for a maximum of 115 years.\n\nThe reputation of Solana took a beating during the episode. But, a lot has changed since then.\n\nDuring the recent bull run, its price surged more than 160% within a month to $57.86 at press time.\n\nHowever, both SOL\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) rested below the neutral 50-level. It seems that the price rally isn\u2019t going to last long as these on-chart indicators suggested.\n\nHowever, the overwhelming majority of opinion favors a further price rally for Solana.\n\nQuizzing ChatGPT about Solana\u2019s price trends\n\nWe decided to ask ChatGPT for its take on the price trends of Solana in the future. ChatGPT has been a remarkable AI chatbot which has proved to be a powerful tool for learning on an array of topics. Yet, we must remember that the bot is engineered to mimic a human, and is not necessarily guaranteed to be factually accurate.\n\nAnd yet, it is possible to obtain some guesses from the chatbot on what the future might hold if we provide it with details about recent price movements.\n\nWe asked ChatGPT to predict Solana\u2019s price towards the end of the year.\n\nSolana could potentially reach a stellar price of $500 by the end of December 2023, forecasted ChatGPT. A surge of 8x in its price within two months seems very unlikely.\n\nWe then asked ChatGPT to predict Solana\u2019s cryptocurrency by the end of 2024. As usual, its classic version didn\u2019t solicit any response.\n\nBut the jailbroken version predicted SOL\u2019s price to hit $1,000 by December 2024.\n\nI suppose the bot was already presuming that its earlier prediction of $500 in December 2023 would indeed come true. It thereafter expected SOL to surge even further to $1,000.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nConclusion\n\nChatGPT predicted too positive a performance for Solana in 2023 and 2024. It expected SOL to reach $1,000 by December 2024. However, its on-chart metrics were rather modest.\n\nTraders are advised to do their own research before investing in a crypto-asset."
