        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nAs the crypto bull market approaches, altcoins are all the rage. Some of the best crypto projects on offer this alt season are Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Cosmos (ATOM), Avalanche (AVAX) and newcomer, Big Eyes Coin (BIG). With a record-breaking presale, Big Eyes Coin has already made quite the impression and is destined for greatness as the presale comes to an end.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Ends Presale With A BIG Bonus Code\n\nBig Eyes Coin is coming to the end of its impressive presale. Having started in late 2022, this new project has raised over $35 million, with presale ending on June 3rd. In the lead-up to the launch, the team are offering investors the chance to receive a 300% bonus with their purchase by using the code END300.\n\nInvestors have been flocking to Big Eyes Coin for its unique and innovative features. The impressive ecosystem is designed to self-propagate growth for the community, with NFTs, regular giveaways and a community-centred approach. The project will also have real-world utility to help users make money, and to ensure the longevity of the token.\n\nCardano Announces Djed Alliance\n\nCardano is one of the top performing crypto assets, currently ranked 7th by market capitalization and its on-chain activity is on the rise. Cardano\u2019s ecosystem allows developers to create tokens and decentralised applications (dApps) on its scalable blockchain network. The most recent development for the blockchain is the announcement of the Djed alliance which will allow the deployment of stablecoin on the Ethereum compatible sidechain of Cardano. Analysts predict that this could act as a catalyst for Cardano\u2019s growth this year.\n\nSolana Partners With AI\n\nSolana has been one of the top performing cryptos this year, which was a surprise following its poor performance in 2022. Solana is a smart contract platform with an innovative architecture that allows it to process thousands of transactions per second while keeping costs very low. It has one of the most impressive ecosystems in the crypto sector and uses a proof-of-history algorithm with a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. It has just released a ChaptGPT plugin which allows users to interact with Solana through the AI ChaptGPT chatbox. This is set to simplify many tasks for Solana users including the ability to check wallet balances, make token transfers and buy NFTs on the Solana blockchain.\n\nCosmos \u2013 The Internet Of Blockchains\n\nKnown as the \u2018internet of blockchains\u2019, Cosmos is an innovative blockchain that is designed to allow blockchain platforms to interoperate with each other. It uses a proof-of-stake consensus which enhances its energy efficiency and can connect with blockchains outside of the Cosmos ecosystem using a protocol called IBC (inter-blockchain communication). Cosmos has been gaining this year, with a 2.48% hike in the last week alone.\n\nCan Avalanche Continue Bullish Momentum?\n\nAvalanche has seen a bullish trend since the start of the year, recording impressive and stable market activity. While it was trading at around $10 at the start of the year, it rallied to $20 in the first few weeks of 2023, before calming down to around $16 today. Avalanche is popular for its ability to deliver trustworthy agreements in a widespread computer network and has been dubbed the \u2018Ethereum killer\u2019 for its ability to perform a high level of transactions per second.\n\nThe crypto market is constantly evolving with new coins being introduced and new developments in the market. Big Eyes Coin is set to make a big impression when it enters the market, and users have the chance to make a high return on their investments by buying in presale and using the 300% bonus code, END300.\n\nFor More On Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpensea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nDigiToads is a meme coin project that has become the talk of the crypto community. Unlike other meme coin projects that fade as their trend vanishes, DigiToads is a revolutionary project that is here to stay. With its fast-selling TOADS tokens, a play-to-earn gaming model, and exciting features that allow investors and community members to earn passive income, DigiToads has become the trendiest cryptocurrency to buy this year.\n\nExperts believe if this meme coin project grows at the same pace, it will soon stand among the top 100 credible crypto coins on Coinmarketcap. Solana and Polygon, on the other hand, which were once top crypto projects to look out for, are now showing slow performance in the competitive market.\n\nDigiToads: The Rising Crypto Asset\n\nWith a toad as its mascot, DigiToads is a project gaining popularity for its exciting and practical features. DigiToads investors and community members are praising one of these exciting features: the Toad-Cade. Players in this Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming can care for their toads like pets in preparation for tournaments. Each toad in this game has its personality traits, strengths, and flaws. Using $TOADS, players may stock up on supplies to feed and train their virtual toads. Once the toad is stronger and ready to defeat other toad pets, players can participate in exciting gaming contests to bag prizes and $TOADS for every win.\n\nAnother factor that has helped DigiToads become a successful meme coin project, leaving many competitors in the dust, is its rapidly selling TOADS token. The deflationary token of the project has become one of the fastest-selling crypto assets among meme coin investors while still in its Lilypad 6 stage, selling more than 85% of the TOADS tokens allotted for the presale. The current price of 1 $TOADS is 0.027 USDT.\n\nHolders of three or more TOADS NFTs can also participate in DigiToads Toad School, which offers complete courses taught by trading specialists. Because of this Toad School, trading students can learn from the best and become market leaders, making DigiToads an excellent cryptocurrency for beginners. Toad School graduates will be recognized as Pro-Traders, and they will be able to polish their skills and earn real-time on DigiToads\u2019 upcoming decentralized exchange, The Trading Post. The exchange will be introduced once DigiToads creates its strong community of ToadVestors.\n\nDigiToads will host on-chain trade contests with Platinum Toad awards every month. Because these contests will last a year, there will be 12 Platinum Toads available for grabs. Platinum Toad holders will gain remote access to one-twelfth of the TOADS treasury, which they may trade with. DigiToads intends to use this strategy to build the best trading community inside its ecosystem to manage the treasury while allowing traders to seek 10% profits on all trading earnings.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nSolana:\n\nSolana\u2019s May 3, 2023 price analysis shows the market in a partially bullish movement. However, Solana has achieved enormous negative momentum, indicating a decrease in the SOL market.\n\nPolygon:\n\nPolygon (MATIC) established itself as an essential component of the Ethereum network. It sprang to prominence as a scaling solution for Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees, limited throughput, and interoperability layer. However, this reliable crypto asset has subsequently experienced a volatile market trend. Polygon (MATIC) recently fell below $1.0 for the first time since January 2023.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe slow market movements of best cryptocurrencies like Solana and Polygon are influencing investors to add TOADS to their crypto portfolios. DigiToad\u2019s rising meme coin trend of a toad and practical features promise investors and community 400x returns on their investment, setting this project apart from competitors.\n\nWith different value-adding features adding to the market stability of DigiToads fast-selling TOADS tokens, crypto analysts predict this meme coin will soon rank among the 100 top crypto coins in the market today.\n\nFor more information on DigiToads, visit the website, join the presale, or join the community for regular updates.\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."
