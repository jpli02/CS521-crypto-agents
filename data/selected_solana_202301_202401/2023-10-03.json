        "title": "SOL Exploded by 25% Weekly, Here are the Key Targets (Solana Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Solana has been one of the best performers in the altcoins space for over a week and is approaching $30.\n\nKey Support levels: $22, $20\n\nKey Resistance levels: $25, $28\n\n1. Massive Rally Ongoing\n\nWith the breakout from the downtrend successful, SOL started a major rally, which increased its price by over 25% this week alone. This impressive performance has taken Solana just under the key resistance at $25. Should this momentum continue, then the next target will be $28.\n\n2. Is $30 Likely?\n\nThe most significant resistance will be found above $30, which was the previous high from July. While Solana may have the strength to reach it, it would be surprising to see it pass that level on the first attempt.\n\n3. Bullish Cross Sparks a Buying Frenzy\n\nThe 3-day MACD completed a bullish cross, and the buying pressure exploded this week. This is a major change in the market momentum and may last for quite some time before SOL enters a significant correction.\n\nBias\n\nThe bias for SOL is bullish.\n\nShort-Term Prediction for SOL Price\n\nThe biggest targets on the chart are $28 and $30. At this rate, Solana is likely to hit them. The biggest question is if SOL will also be able to sustain its price at those levels. In the past, sellers came in strong after the price hit $30."

        "content": "Solana's cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko recently took to social media to criticize Ethereum, describing it as a \"novel spectacle of bourgeois upheaval\" rather than a genuine revolution. He argued that Ethereum perpetuates a form of digital tyranny, pressing upon the \"toiling masses\" with a different but equally oppressive boot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYakovenko emphasized the need for a truly stateless digital realm, where the cost of state creation is negligible, to emancipate people from capitalist intermediaries and state surveillance.\n\nIn response, Vitalik Buterin had earlier noted that \"smart people\" have told him Solana has an \"earnest\" developer community. This seemed like a subtle nod of approval toward Solana, but it also left room for interpretation.\n\nIt is somewhat self-righteous for Yakovenko to criticize Ethereum for not being a true revolution for the \"toiling masses\" when Solana itself has been propelled to the top of the cryptocurrency market with significant financial backing from VCs. This backing has arguably made Solana more of a \"VC's blockchain\" than a \"people's blockchain.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Buterin's comment about Solana's \"earnest\" developer community is a more diplomatic approach. It acknowledges Solana's contributions without necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with its philosophy. However, it also subtly implies that while Solana may have an earnest community, that does not necessarily make it revolutionary or superior to Ethereum.\n\nBoth leaders raise compelling points. Yakovenko questions the social impact of blockchain technology, urging the community to aim for true decentralization and accessibility. Buterin, meanwhile, seems to focus on the practical aspects, implicitly suggesting that an \"earnest\" community can indeed bring about meaningful changes, even if it does not fully align with everyone's ideological expectations."

        "content": "Despite opening the week on a bullish note, the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sector are consolidating their earlier gains, including Solana (SOL), but for which certain artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms predict a much brighter future by the end of this year.\n\nAs it happens, the AI-driven price prediction algorithms over at the cryptocurrency tracking platform CoinCodex have set the price of Solana at $39.73 by December 31, 2023, which would indicate a gain of nearly 65% to its price at press time, as per the most recent data seen by Finbold on October 3.\n\nSolana 3-month price prediction. Source: CoinCodex\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nIn terms of its price at present, Solana stood at $24.08, demonstrating a decline of 0.6% in the last 24 hours, although across the previous seven days, it has accumulated a gain of 24.52%, in addition to increasing 23.23% in the past month and as much as 140% since the year\u2019s turn.\n\nSolana year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIt is also worth noting that Finbold had previously reported on Solana rapidly approaching the $25.50 price level, from where, should the cryptocurrency surpass it, there is a strong chance of continuing the bullish move, as pseudonymous crypto market analyst Crypto Tony observed.\n\nMoreover, the same crypto expert had earlier predicted Solana at $100 \u201cnext week,\u201d and while some of his followers disagreed with such a prognosis, it is not entirely impossible for the seventh-largest crypto asset by market capitalization, which had its all-time high (ATH) at almost $260.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the AI algorithms also see the $100 price level in Solana\u2019s future, although not as soon as Crypto Tony would have it. Specifically, their one-year prediction for this digital asset currently targets $107.11 \u2013 a level they expect Solana to hit by October 1, 2024.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Solana Beach City Council members approved an ordinance Sept. 27 that allows for more enforcement of e-bikes and bicycles on local roads, honing in on some of the unsafe behaviors local residents have noticed, and creates a diversion program that gives first-time offenders a chance to complete a safety course.\n\nSeveral other cities have added similar regulations as the rise in popularity of e-bikes on local roads has coincided with more collisions . Encinitas council members added a diversion program, with enforcement aimed at schools during the morning and afternoon hours when children are arriving and departing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve also indicated that they\u2019ve noticed a definite trend toward more kids wearing helmets and obeying the laws,\u201d Solana Beach City Manager Greg Wade said \u201cKeep your fingers crossed, we hope that this will have an impact.\u201d\n\nAccording to a city staff report, the ordinance will penalize \u201cmore violations for bicycle and e-bike-related behavior than just the prohibition of riding bicycles on sidewalks.\u201d\n\nE-bike and bicycle riders will be required to \u201cobserve all applicable laws including yielding to pedestrians,\u201d according to the text of the ordinance. Riding on sidewalks is banned on any street that has a designated bicycle path. It\u2019s also illegal for riders to have passengers sitting on handlebars or anywhere else on the bike that isn\u2019t designed to carry another person.\n\nGiven that Class 1 and 2 e-bikes can reach assisted speeds of up to 20 mph, and Class 3 e-bike riders can zoom up to 28 mph, residents have been concerned about children using them with little preparation or experience on the roads.\n\nThe issue of e-bike safety has been a priority followed by two recent fatalities, one in Carlsbad last year and one in Encinitas a few months ago.\n\nE-bike safety has also been a growing priority for state lawmakers. The California Highway Patrol released an e-bike safety online course, per the direction of a bill by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner, D-Encinitas. Another bill proposed by Boerner would add licensing and age requirements for children to ride e-bikes.\n\nSolana Beach City Councilmember Jill MacDonald has repeatedly expressed her concern about children riding on sidewalks.\n\n\u201cI hope one of the takeaways about this ordinance is that your children are on e-bikes, they\u2019re not driving age, they\u2019re on the streets, they\u2019re not always obeying the traffic laws, they\u2019re sometimes going through stop signs, they\u2019re sometimes ignoring traffic lights,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cPlease make sure they\u2019re safe.\u201d"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nStar Atlas creator ATMTA is unlocking access to its developer tools and documentation on the Solana blockchain, offering fellow game creators access to its ecosystem and economy starting with the new SAGE Labs browser-based game.\n\nFor developers wanting to take a peek under the hood of Star Atlas, the company has released a building hub where links and documentation can be found, offering free access to Star Atlas\u2019 imagery, audiovisual assets, Unreal Engine tooling, APIs, and mainnet program IDs and addresses.\n\nOther features include a new player profile for customized gaming, a tool to use the ATLAS token for Solana transactions instead of SOL, a system for managing token ownership and permissions, an enlistment tool for factions that other developers can use, and functions to regulate the sending of in-game tokens like ships.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStar Atlas is a space exploration-themed role-playing game (RPG) built on the Solana network. ATMTA launched a \u201cshowroom\u201d demo on the Epic Games Store in September 2022. SAGE Labs (Star Atlas Golden Era) is a browser-based game that ties into the larger Star Atlas universe.\n\nATMTA said that it is making its Star Atlas data publicly available in the name of transparency and fostering trust among players and stakeholders, with the aim of also creating a broader ecosystem of apps around the game.\n\n\u201cIt's what transforms Star Atlas from just being a set of gaming products to a development platform,\u201d Star Atlas CEO Michael Wagner told Decrypt\u2019s GG in an exclusive interview. \u201cYou can even commercialize using those [Star Atlas] assets.\u201d\n\nAs Wagner explained, ATMTA requires no cut for the first $1 million worth of gross revenue for any company that uses the tools. If a company using Star Atlas\u2019 assets and branding begins generating more than $1 million in revenue, fees ranging from 3% to 10% kick in depending on which industry or sector the company operates within.\n\nIn a release, ATMTA wrote that the tools can be harnessed to create new functionality around SAGE Labs, but it can also enable creators to spin off into new genres and experiences built around the same assets and features.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is also part of cultivating a flourishing ecosystem of people who want to build around Star Atlas,\u201d Wagner added. \u201cIt effectively says that here's a repository of assets, including branding and Star Atlas imagery, that you are free to use.\u201d\n\nWhile Wagner is optimistic about the rollout of the Star Atlas build platform and SAGE Labs, he did acknowledge that there could be hurdles to launching such public resources.\n\n\u201cThe only potential challenge is we just get a bunch of people asking questions because they want to build something using it. Maybe they don't completely understand it, but that's about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is a win. Nevertheless, it's people coming in requiring resources from us to help get them started.\u201d\n\nThough Star Atlas has been hotly anticipated by the Solana community, the road to success has not been without its bumps. In July, ATMTA reduced its staff by 73%, citing market conditions and spending needs. Wagner said that as painful as it was to let those people go, it was necessary and that the Star Atlas teams\u2019 efficiency and momentum have improved significantly. He\u2019s optimistic about where the company is heading.\n\n\u201cRevenues are ticking up, and we're seeing a lot more peer-to-peer transaction volume, which helps us with our royalty fees,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cSentiment in our community couldn't be higher.\u201d\n\nWhile SAGE Labs' build hub is intended for the Solana ecosystem, Wagner said that anyone on any blockchain can benefit from the information and tools. Using SAGE Labs, he added, anyone can build their own front-end user interface (UI) or even customize gameplay mechanics and roll out a separate product.\n\n\u201cIf they build something that's better, it still uses all of the Star Atlas assets; that's how the programs are defined,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cAnd if that happens to get really popular, well, then we can just focus more of our attention on Unreal Engine. We still have to build more programs.\u201d"
