        "content": "Alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP, Ether (ETH), SOL, Tron's TRX, Dogecoin (DOGE) and are tracking bitcoin higher, as they usually do. The altcoin bounce comes days after traders sold these tokens, pricing in the possibility of defunct exchange FTX securing approval from the bankruptcy court to sell assets from its multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency holdings. SOL fell over 8% on Monday, leading the decline in altcoins after a court filing showed FTX's solana holdings at $1.6 billion."

        "content": "A top crypto trader says that he is reaccumulating one Solana (SOL) ecosystem crypto and another under-the-radar altcoin.\n\nPseudonymous trader The Flow Horse, formerly known as Cantering Clark, tells his 182,400 followers on the social media platform X that the Solana-based sports betting and online gambling platform Rollbit (RLB) and crypto claims trading and derivatives marketplace Open Exchange (OX) are currently attractively priced after undergoing corrections of between 30% and 60%.\n\n\u201cStarted buying back OX and RLB.\n\nAmerican football season is starting which ideally should bring attention to Rollbit as crypto futures dry up more, both venues are still underpriced, and the expected dip has been generous.\u201d\n\nRLB is trading at $0.143 at time of writing, down by around 30% from its all-time high reached in August. Since mid-June, RLB has rallied by around 521%.\n\nOX is trading at $0.0328 at time of writing, down by around 60% from its all-time high recorded last month.\n\nOn why he believes OX is underpriced, the pseudonymous analyst says,\n\n\u201cCrypto Twitter will buy all types of meaningless garbage, so my alarm bells go off with something being unanimously hated. It just means that it is under-allocated for the time being, and I would not put it past the people behind the token to use it as a signaling mechanism.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "A Degen's Guide to Solana Points - Delphi Digital",
        "content": "Jito \u2014 the MEV-powered liquid staking provider on Solana \u2014 just became the latest DeFi protocol to launch a points program. We\u2019ve been following Solana\u2019s points meta for awhile, so see this blog post and Ghost of Cycles Past report for more deep divey thoughts. This post will skew more degen-y.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a high level, points are a way to quantify and reward users\u2019 contributions to a protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n@segfaultdoctor\n\nWe\u2019ve seen several Solana DeFi protocols unveil points programs, including MarginFi, Cypher, Solend, and now Jito.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all these points poppin up, it\u2019s worth asking: what\u2019s the best strategy for stackin \u2019em?\n\nDisclosure: none of this is investment advice. Proceed with caution; these strategies involve several layers of risks.\n\nLet\u2019s start our very sophisticated DCF analysis on points by comparing each of the points programs.\n\nmrgn points:\n\n$1 lent = 1 point per day\n\n$1 borrowed = 4 points per day\n\nreferring users also earns you points. see mrgn blog for the maths\n\ncypher points:\n\n$1 perps (maker) volume = 20 points\n\n$1 perps (taker) volume = 15 points\n\n$1 spot (maker) volume = 10 points\n\n$1 lent = 1 point per day\n\n$1 borrowed = 5 points per day\n\nnote: cypher just announced its $CYPH tokenomics; its point program is still live (for now), but the plan is to deprecate it when the CYPH token launches\n\nsolend points:\n\n$1 margin trading volume = 10 points\n\n10M points are distributed per day\n\nlending/borrowing points are distributed proportionally to global lend/borrow\n\nsolend points have \u201cseasons.\u201d the ongoing season 1 has 100k SLND and will last ~3 months\n\nsee solend blog for the maths\n\njito points:\n\n1 jitoSOL = 1 point per day\n\n1 jitoSOL in money market (marginfi, solend) = 1.5 points per day\n\n1 jitSOL in liquidity pool (orca, raydium) = 2 points per day\n\nreferrals earn you 10% of points they earn\n\nAlright, so now that we have all the numbers in one place, how can we play this points meta in a GTO fashion? Well, ideally, you want to combine as many points programs as you can to really maxx your rewards. Here\u2019s one idea:\n\n\n\n\n\n@mrink0\n\nLet\u2019s assume you have $20,000 good ole uncle sam bucks. You turn $20k USD into 1,000 SOL ($20/SOL). You then head over to Jito and stake that 1,000 SOL for 944 jitoSOL, where you\u2019ll earn ~6.9% on your staked SOL.\n\nYou now have options. You can LP your jitoSOL on Solana DEXs like Orca, but most of these pools are unincentized and thus don\u2019t offer great yields. Many would also put your schmoney at risk of IL, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo wat do? Well, an alternative strategy to LPing, is to dump your jitoSOL into a money market protocol like marginfi and earn additional interest on your deposits. Granted, it\u2019s not that much @ 0.04% APY for jitoSOL deposits, but it\u2019s something. You\u2019d also be earning mrgn points in the process. And if you really wanted to get crazy, you could then borrow against your jitoSOL deposits and do some looping. Anders from marginfi had a good thread on this.\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay so let\u2019s say you want to loop. One rewards-maximizing strategy you could pursue is to borrow USDC against your jitoSOL collateral and eat the 7.7% borrow APY. Then flip your USDC into UXD and deposit all the UXD back into marginfi to earn an incentivized ~8% yield. So, you wouldn\u2019t be making that much on the yield spread, but you would be juicing your marginfi points and also getting some upside exposure to UXP (UXD protocol\u2019s gov token), which makes up ~7% of UXD\u2019s total 8% yield.\n\nOn a pure points basis, this is probably one of the better Solana DeFi strategies right now. If you were to do this with 20k USD, here\u2019s the total points you would stand to make across Jito and marginfi:\n\n$20,000 = 1,000 SOL (1 SOL = $20)\n\n1,000 SOL = 944 jitoSOL\n\njito points \u2014 944 jitoSOL in marginfi = 1,416 jito points/day and 520,490 jito points/year\n\nmarginfi lending points \u2014 944 jitoSOL in marginfi = 20,000 mgrn points/day and 7.3 million mrgn points/year\n\nmarginfi looping points \u2014 if we assume you borrow the max USDC against your jitoSOL collateral, then you\u2019d have 5,000 USDC 5,000 USDC marginfi borrow = 20,000 mrgn points/day and 7.3 million mrgn points/year 5,000 UXD marginfi deposit = 5,000 mrgn points/day and 1.825 million mrgn points/year\n\n\n\nSo, in summation, your annual rewards across protocols employing this points maxxing strat would look something like this:\n\n520,490 jito points\n\n16.425 million mrgn points\n\n< $100 interest income from USDC-UXD rate spread, assuming rates stay constant and you immediately dump all UXP rewards\n\nAnyway, this is just one strategy to consider; there are many more to explore. And hopefully, far more salient opportunities still lie on the horizon as Solana DeFi continues to stage an impressive post-FTX recovery. Happy points farming!"

        "content": "Everlodge (ELDG), now in its presale phase, is carving an impressive path that makes it stand shoulder-to-shoulder with established giants Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). This piece delves into the journey of Everlodge, outlining its rise and the potential to reshape the future of DeFi.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): An 80% Price Surge and Global Anticipation\n\nWith just $100, you could own a stake in an upscale New York hotel, a coveted Airbnb in London's center, or a serene Maldivian villa. But how is this possible?\n\nThe Everlodge vision is to transmute these properties into divisible NFTs available for trade on the blockchain, making high-end real estate investments accessible to many without hefty initial investments.\n\nAnchored on the Ethereum blockchain, these NFTs embody trust, clarity, genuineness, and an unmatched level of investor authority. Notably, the NFT metadata encapsulates every critical property detail to avoid the limitations of traditional real estate investments.\n\nEverlodge's idea is a game-changing one. Its potential lies in that real estate investments usually limited to investors with deep pockets, can now be purchased as fractional shares at low prices. Thus, Everlodge allows smaller-sized investors to benefit from the industry's growth without paying exorbitant fees or settling for lower returns.\n\nThe fervor surrounding Everlodge's presale is palpable, with millions of investors clamoring for the last remaining ELDG tokens selling for $0.018 in phase 3. The current price represents an 80% pump as the price rises throughout the presale event.\n\nGiven that the vacation rental market is valued at a staggering $82.6 billion and is poised for a 4.7% CAGR from 2023-2030, change is unmistakably in the wind. The upside for Everlodge is immense, prompting early investors to look at the project's promise in anticipation.\n\nAnalysts project Everlodge not merely as a participant but potentially as a game-changer in the real estate landscape, with whispers of ELDG's value skyrocketing by a whopping 30x once the full platform launches.\n\nEthereum (ETH)'s Fluctuations between $2,000 and $2,100\n\nOver the past few months, Ethereum has attempted to break free from the $2,000 to $2,100 range. However, a swift 12% descent over the past few weeks to the $1,600 level has further dampened Ethereum's momentum.\n\nSo, what's curbing Ethereum's potential? Despite its strong fundamentals and a $21 billion TVL, Ethereum remains chained to Bitcoin's price movements. As Bitcoin grapples with its own market hurdles, Ethereum is caught in the ensuing ripple effect, leading traders to seek more stable grounds.\n\nBut the Bitcoin link is just one facet. Diminishing network activity and looming apprehensions of massive sell-offs further darken the horizon. This sentiment is mirrored in Ethereum's TVL, which witnessed a sharp 50% drop since mid-April.\n\nYet, for Ethereum's major stakeholders, the landscape isn't entirely bleak. Many draw parallels between the early promise they saw in Ethereum in 2017 and the potential they now see in Everlodge. This budding interest, amplified by the enticing offers in the Everlodge presale, is steering Ethereum traders to venture into this emerging realm.\n\nSolana (SOL): Shifting Investor Focus to New Horizons like Everlodge (ELDG)\n\nSolana's price recently surged from $8 to an admirable $32. A combination of factors fueled this ascent: Solana's recovery from the FTX debacle, the success of the Ripple/SEC legal case, and its ability to overcome minor technical glitches that once dampened its appeal.\n\nHowever, despite this strong trajectory, Solana could not breach the $32 resistance point. Its current standing at $18.95 marks a considerable 40% slide in just two months. While analysts hold the conviction that the $16 mark offers staunch support, the precipitous drop undeniably jolted the faith of Solana enthusiasts.\n\nYet, experts continue to spotlight Solana's promise as a frontrunner in layer-1 technology and the DeFi realm. Since the year's outset, the platform's 50% augmentation in TVL is a testament to its bullish prospects.\n\nThat said, it's undeniable that Solana, much like its counterparts, has been swayed by the overarching bearish market mood. Consequently, some investors are setting their sights on fresher prospects, with Everlodge emerging as a shining beacon in the darkness.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.
