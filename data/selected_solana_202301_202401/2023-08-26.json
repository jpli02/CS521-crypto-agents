        "content": "CNBC, one of the world\u2019s largest cable news networks providing real-time financial market coverage, has dropped Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) and replaced them with Solana (SOL). Meanwhile, they will continue to cover news related to Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the world\u2019s most valuable crypto platforms and pioneers in their respective fields.\n\nAs of August 26, it could not be ascertained why CNBC dropped Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. However, what\u2019s evident is that they have been on the receiving end in recent days, and their valuation has been suffering in the past few years.\n\nSOL In, BCH And LTC Out\n\nDespite posting impressive gains in July, BCH has recoiled as the hype around the approval of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States faded. Bitcoin and BCH rose earlier after BlackRock applied for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, Litecoin is down days after halving its miner rewards in early August.\n\nSubsequently, BCH and LTC are no longer in the top 10 by market capitalization and have emerging smart contracts and transactional networks that have taken positions in recent years. LTC and BCH have a market capitalization of around $4.8 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, and are among the top 20 most valuable coins at 16th and 18th in the leaderboard.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana is perched at 9th in the market cap leaderboard, commanding a valuation of $8.3 billion. The network is ahead of Tron, at 10th, with 6.9 billion. SOL is also closing in on Dogecoin and Cardano, whose market cap stands at $8.8 and $9.1 billion, respectively.\n\nRise Of NFT Activity And Solana Pay\n\nThat CNBC chose to cover SOL and dismiss BCH and LTC has triggered discussions in social media platforms. On X, one user said the decision was an endorsement for Solana. He pointed to the developments \u201cbehind the scenes,\u201d including the spike in non-fungible token (NFT) activity.\n\nIn early July, the number of NFTs minted on Solana surpassed those generated from Ethereum for the first time since May 2022. The surge could be attributed to Solana\u2019s high scalability, which translates to low transaction fees, benefiting creators. OpenSea and Rarible, two of the world\u2019s popular NFT marketplaces, supported Solana NFTs in 2022. With their support, it becomes easier for users to trade, which could further boost blockchain activity.\n\nBeyond NFTs, Solana Pay, a payment solution, is finding traction. Early this week, Shopify, a leading ecommerce platform, integrated Solana Pay for users to settle USDC payments easily. Circle, the issuer of USDC, and Checkout, a payment processor, have supported Solana Pay.\n\nFeatured image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Solana NFT volume has surged over 120% in the last 24 hours.\n\nSolana Blue Chip NFT Index has also seen a 10% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe Solana [SOL] NFT space has experienced a surge in activity over the past few days, as recent data indicates. How has this recent uptick in activity affected the NFT trade volume and the value of SOL?\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nSolana NFT volume surges\n\nAs of 24 August, according to a post by Step Data Insights, Solana emerged with the highest NFT sales volume within the last 24 hours. The post unveiled a nearly 20% surge in sales volume for Solana, in contrast to Ethereum [ETH], which experienced approximately a 3.4% increase during the same duration.\n\nHowever, a more comprehensive analysis of the volume data on Crypto Slam revealed a more substantial escalation in sales volume. As of this writing, the sales volume had skyrocketed by over 124% within the past 24 hours.\n\nFurthermore, while Solana trailed behind Ethereum regarding trade volume denominated in USD, it outpaced Ethereum regarding the number of sales within the same timeframe. As of this writing, the cumulative sales volume had accrued to approximately $2.2 million.\n\nAnalyzing the Solana 7-day NFT volume\n\nAccording to insights gathered from Solana Floor, it was evident that the surge in activity was not confined solely to daily trading volumes; the seven-day trading volume also experienced a positive upswing. As of this writing, the seven-day volume had escalated by 12%, amassing nearly $5 million in USD volume.\n\nIn addition, the Solana Blue Chip NFT Index indicated a notable 10% surge within the last 24 hours. However, it was worth noting that this increase remained below the threshold it had reached earlier in the month.\n\nFurthermore, the statistics from Solana Floor highlighted that Mad Labs had established itself as the top NFT collection on the network. As of this writing, it had a cumulative floor value surpassing $11 million, with the second-highest floor value coming at over $8 million.\n\nHow does this impact the total SOL NFT trade volume?\n\nDespite the impressive surge in total volume, the SOL NFT trade volume, as indicated by Santiment data, remained unaffected. As of this writing, the cumulative trade volume denominated in USD barely surpassed $2,600.\n\nThis figure presented a stark divergence from the average volume of around $5 million observed before the significant decline around July.\n\nHowever, an improvement could be seen if the ongoing spike in trading volume maintains its momentum. In that case, there was a possibility that the USD trade volume could revisit the region where it had been prominent several months earlier.\n\nThis suggests a potential resurgence in trading activity if the current trend continues."
