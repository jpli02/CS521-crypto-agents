        "content": "The Solana-based crypto lending platform Jet is relaunching with fixed-rate loans, taking a page from traditional finance even as the majority of its crypto rivals cling to variable rate products.\n\nJet uses an order book design where borrowers and lenders set their own terms, including the level of interest rates and payback timelines.\n\n\u201cIt's not some artificially derived APY,\u201d or annualized percentage yield, said founder James Moreau. \u201cIt's entirely market-based.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how most capital moves through the global economy. In crypto, things are different; lending protocols advertise ever-changing interest rates that can climb sky-high and crash in the same day. The upside is that you might make a lot of money by taking a lot of risk. The downside is that you probably won\u2019t.\n\nEven with less risk, Moreau said, Jet\u2019s model faces some friction from big traders like market makers who have grown used to the flexibility of variable-rate products, where they can often pull their money at any time (assuming the utilization rate isn't too high, of course). With a fixed-rate product their crypto is locked for the length of the contract.\n\nJet\u2019s own performance metrics \u2013 like almost every Solana protocol \u2013 have fallen sharply from their highs in late 2021, when the protocol had over $36 million in total value locked, according to DeFLlama. These days it is under $200,000.\n\nMoreau admits it's unlikely that fixed-rate lending products will provide the spark for a rush of liquidity returning to Solana. But he\u2019s hopeful that the product can appeal to a niche of DAOs and other on-chain organizations who have large, dormant treasuries they can put to use.\n\nTraders of staked SOL can also find \u201ca very easy use case\u201d for acquiring easy money through Jet, Moreau said. He\u2019s targeting those who are engaged in maximal extractable value (MEV) strategies and staked SOL.\n\n\u201cWe basically want to see as much of the lending money get borrowed as possible, and so that's what I'm working on,\u201d Moreau said."

        "title": "An Overview of xNFTs - LCX",
        "content": "Difference between xNFTs and NFTs\n\nxNFTs NFTs Can run code inside them While NFTs cannot run a code inside them xNFTs and NFTs can represent verifiably unique and scarce digital assets While NFTs also represent verifiably unique and scarce digital assets as well. Are exclusive to Solana While NFTs are available on Ethereum. Use React xNFT, a framework for building executable NFTs on Solana. NFTs on Ethereum use the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standards.\n\nHow do xNFTs function?\n\nExecutable NFTs are generated using xNFT, an algorithm for creating executable NFTs on Solana. It enables developers to build native Web3 applications and standards that operate within the environment of a web browser. In other words, they may display elements directly while effectively connecting to external applications.\n\nxNFTs are distributed as SPL tokens, the Solana equivalent of the ERC-20 standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum. SPL tokens can be transferred, traded, and stored in any supported wallet or application. The computer that runs the system obtains the program ID from the blockchain and extracts the code from the program database when a user opens an xNFT. The code is then executed using the runtime execution engine of React xNFT within the sandbox. The React xNFT components that render the xNFT\u2019s user interface enable users to communicate with it.\n\nUse Cases of xNFTs\n\nFractional Ownership: These permit fractional ownership of valuable assets like artwork, real estate, and uncommon collectibles. By dividing a non-financial asset (NFA) into smaller portions, multiple investors can own a portion of the asset, making it more affordable and readily available.\n\nPortfolio Diversification: They offer investors the chance to diversify their holdings by purchasing fractional shares of multiple NFTs. Individuals can obtain exposure to a wide range of assets without allocating a significant quantity of their money to a single NFT.\n\nCollective Ownership: It facilitates collective asset ownership and management. Organizations or groups can collaboratively own an NFT and engage in asset-related decision-making processes, such as lending, renting, and exhibiting.\n\nAccessible Investing: Fractionalizing NFTs facilitates the investment of high-value assets by individuals with limited capital. By lowering the barrier to entry, more individuals will be able to partake in the NFT market and possibly profit from the rising value of valuable assets.\n\nRoyalties and Revenue Sharing: These can integrate smart contracts for the distribution of royalties or revenue shares to fractional owners. This feature enables creators or artists to share their NFTs\u2019 financial benefits with investors or supporters.\n\nCollateralization of Loans: Fractionalized NFTs can be used as security for loans and other financial products. By pledging fractions of a NFT, owners can access capital without selling their whole share of the asset.\n\nConclusion\n\nBesides being a group of generative avatars, they are also executable NFTs, meaning they have additional functionality. Interoperability is evidently the ultimate aim of the xNFT ecosystem. Innovative products such as xNFTs will introduce a more user-centric product experience to the Web3 ecosystem while providing software developers with a completely customizable application platform."

        "content": "Neon EVM announces the launch of its closed beta.\n\nWhat is Neon EVM\n\nNeon EVM is a low-friction solution that enables Ethereum DApps to settle transactions on Solana, eliminating the gap between these two leading blockchains.\n\nNeon EVM positions Ethereum developers to enjoy the best of Solana\u2019s network, from low fees to high transaction speeds and parallel transaction execution capabilities.\n\nWhile Solana is one of the fastest organically-growing chains, its incompatibility with EVM has left several hundred million in TVL, millions of users and an entire ecosystem untouched by EVM multichain DApp developers \u2013 until now.\n\nNeon EVM\u2019s pioneering solution is the anticipated innovation in the Solana ecosystem and makes Solana a viable option for multichain builders.\n\nNeon EVM brings together the best of both chains while ensuring the finality of settlements on Solana.\n\nWhat is Neon EVM closed beta\n\nThe launch of the closed beta version of Neon EVM \u2013 Neon EVM? \u2013 to Solana\u2019s mainnet is a significant milestone on the roadmap.\n\nNeon EVM? is a fully-functioning Neon EVM with one major alteration \u2013 it supports fee-free transactions.\n\nThis means that all transactions are settled to Solana\u2019s layer one and require payment in Sol, as per any Solana-settled transaction.\n\nHowever, in beta, the NEON token is not requested by the proxy operator responsible for accepting the transaction request and ensuring that it is finalized.\n\nWhy launch in beta\n\nThe Neon EVM ecosystem includes many more players than just the Neon EVM and the proxy operators that accept and settle transaction requests.\n\nIt includes DAO, oracles, indexers, wallets, multisigs, bridges, explorers and more.\n\nNeon EVM? provides an opportunity for all parties to deploy and test to ensure the seamless integration of their services before the official Solana mainnet launch.\n\nWhile Neon EVM could have chosen to do a Shadow mainnet launch on a fork of the Solana mainchain, launching directly to mainnet offers significant advantages \u2013 not least of which is that deployed and tested contracts will retain their addresses on Solana mainnet.\n\nWhy launch in \u2018closed\u2019 beta\n\nLaunching in closed beta allows the Neon EVM team to onboard and test the services of ecosystem players in controlled phases.\n\nThe first phase onboarded the infrastructure components, and the second phase accepted DApps and will test the connection of wallets.\n\nOperating in closed beta also controls the budget by keeping the activity limited to an invite-only list. Remember, while the proxy operator is not charging a fee, the Solana network still does.\n\nIt simply is not possible to provide an open beta and predict the cost in Sol for such an initiative \u2013 though it is possible to predict that the Sol cost will be less than the equivalent ETH cost would be for an EVM settling to Ethereum.\n\nWhen the testing period ends and NEON tokens are available on the market to pay for transactions, Neon EVM will switch back to its normal operation mode.\n\nThis means that independent proxy operators \u2013 P2P and Everstake \u2013 will resume responsibility for accepting and processing transactions. The proxy operator\u2019s RPC endpoints will be made available on ChainList.\n\nWant to get involved\n\nWhile Neon EVM is deployed to Solana mainnet at this address, as this is a closed beta, unless you are on the guest list, it won\u2019t accept your transactions yet.\n\nTo engage with the community, you can find us on Twitter, and join Neon EVM\u2019s very active Discord to meet some of our long-term and loyal community builders.\n\nFor a high-level overview of the technical architecture and features of Neon EVM, the whitepaper is available here.\n\nTo follow the activity of the network, you can view Neon EVM transactions settled to Solana with the NeonScan dashboard."

        "content": "The crypto market is seeing a much-needed upswing, thanks to the multiple Bitcoin ETF filings led by BlackRock, leading to investors regaining confidence on the digital assets. Bitcoin (BTC) managed to climb above the $30,000 mark for the first time since April. Ethereum (ETH), managed to rise above the $1,900 mark alongside.

As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 1,520.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (June 22)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nPepe (PEPE)\n\nPrice: $0.000001512\n\n24-hour gain: 40.66 percent\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nPrice: $139.73\n\n24-hour gain: 24.84 percent\n\nConflux (CFX)\n\nPrice: $0.2564\n\n24-hour gain: 18.12 percent\n\nNeo (NEO)\n\nPrice: $9.22\n\n24-hour gain: 11.66 percent\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV)\n\nPrice: $28.73\n\n24-hour gain: 10.36 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (June 22)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nRocket Pool (RPL)\n\nPrice: $41.69\n\n24-hour loss: 1.17 percent\n\nToncoin (TON)\n\nPrice: $1.38\n\n24-hour loss: 0.69 percent\n\nPAX Gold (PAXG)\n\nPrice: $1,918.17\n\n24-hour loss: 0.38 percent\n\nTether Gold (XAUT)\n\nPrice: $1,934.29\n\n24-hour loss: 0.22 percent\n\nPax Dollar (USDP)\n\nPrice: $1.00\n\n24-hour loss: 0.20 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cOver the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has maintained a position above the $30,000 mark, experiencing a 5 percent increase compared to the previous day. This upward trend has been fueled by investor enthusiasm following the announcement of multiple spot Bitcoin ETF filings. After a prolonged period of decline, BTC has reached its highest value since April 2023. Its month-to-date gains exceed 10 percent and year-to-date gains stand at an impressive 80 per cent. Similarly, Ethereum has surged above the $1,900 level, indicating strong buying activity.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cBTC, up 5.6 percent, crossed its resistance level of $30,000 for the first time since April and currently trading above it. Market confidence has been on the rise as BlackRock has successfully attained over 500 ETF applications, with only one denial. This has started institutional entry into the BTC ETFs by major financial institutions like WisdomTree and Invesco. Fidelity is rumoured to join the bandwagon.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, \u201cBitcoin\u2019s price continues to gain momentum as more financial institutions aid in crypto adoption globally. The market indicators for the largest crypto token indicate a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 sentiment for the second day in a row.\"\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is currently trading at $30,800 and Ethereum is currently around $1,917. The price of Bitcoin has crossed $30,000 and is aiming to reach $31,000, which may lead to a 15 percent increase towards $35,000. The rising momentum of buyers is evident through the rising Relative Strength Index (RSI) and positive green histograms, which indicate bullish dominance. Ethereum (ETH) is also benefiting from Bitcoin's rally with a 5 percent daily gain and a target of $1,941. However, if Bitcoin shows exhaustion, it could break ETH's rally and potentially cause a drop below the 50-day EMA. Ripple (XRP) is trading with a bullish bias, but is facing resistance at the $0.528-$0.520 bid zone, which could turn into blocking failed orders if not breached.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market has experienced a remarkable upswing in trading activity, with a total volume of $59.34 billion over the past 24 hours, representing a substantial 35.35 percent increase. Within this dynamic landscape, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has made significant strides, contributing $3.61 billion in volume, accounting for 6.08 percent of the overall crypto market activity. Additionally, stablecoins have emerged as a dominant force, boasting a volume of $55.33 billion, making up an impressive 93.24 percent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. Notably, Bitcoin has crossed the $30,000 mark, further solidifying its position as a leading cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cEDX Markets, a crypto-platform supported by Schwab and Fidelity, has commenced trading for popular cryptos such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Notably, an institutional non-custodial wallet, meaning it does not hold customer crypto-assets but relies on third-party custodians to ensure the security of customer funds. This approach eliminates concerns about potential fund misappropriation. The emergence of EDX, backed by prominent firms like Citadel Securities and Fidelity Digital Assets, has the potential to reshape the digital asset landscape, particularly in the face of increased scrutiny of the sector by US regulators.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: https://t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
