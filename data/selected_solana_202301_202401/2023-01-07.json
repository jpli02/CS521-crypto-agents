As the first token on the Solana blockchain network to be dog-focused, the new meme coin caused a commotion in the cryptocurrency world. Many people went on board to buy the token as the crypto community sought so much excitement, driving its price to an extremely high pedestal.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of the SHIB killer was $0.00000163, down 57.4% from the previous day. Despite the token\u2019s steep daily decline, its price has increased by more than 2,000% over the last seven days.

When a user on Twitter mentioned that he could think about using BONK tokens to purchase the phone if some of the revenue will be burned off, Solana Mobile suggested it.\n\nTherefore, in addition to using BONK to pay for the Saga phone, it\u2019s also possible that the business will burn some of the new meme coin tokens it makes from sales.\n\nA new meme coin from Solana is being compared to Shiba Inu by many (SHIB). Additionally, BONK has burn features, just like SHIB. However, compared to SHIB\u2019s 549 trillion in circulating supply, $BONK has a significantly smaller 99.185 trillion."

        "content": "Just a week into the new year, and new meme coin Bonk Inu (BONK) has already grabbed eyeballs, this time on Solana.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to reward everyone that made #Solana what it is today,\u201d the team behind the Solana-focused meme coin, which went live on Dec. 25, wrote on Twitter early last month.\n\nThe total supply of the cryptocurrency is set to 100 trillion tokens, half of which were airdropped for free to the Solana community. Buzz surrounding the bounteous airdrop, combined with its developers burning all their tokens, led BONK to surge over 2,000% this week.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAbout 20% of the airdrop went to Solana NFT collections, 15% to early OpenBook traders, 10% to Solana artists and collectors, and 5% to Solana developers, according to the token\u2019s webpage. Its market cap is still tiny, around $77 million, so holders should expect volatility.\n\nThe Inu tokens are a brand of meme coin common across Ethereum and BNB Chain, with Dogecoin knock-off Shiba Inu the premiere example. Token holding binds a meme coin community inspired for potential gains, whether by buzz or by burning supply to boost scarcity.\n\nBonk Inu is porting crypto\u2019s long-running dog coin tradition over to Solana, albeit with a white paper with scant details on future tokenomics, which may raise red flags for some veteran crypto investors.\n\nBONK\u2019s price has retraced by about half from its recent peak, and it may well get worse from here. Source: Blockworks Research\n\nData shows unique BONK wallets have surged about 250% this week. Austin Federa, head of strategy and communications at Solana, has also expressed enthusiasm for the coin.\n\n\u201cWhy Bonk? Bonk is the first Solana dog coin for the people, by the people with 50% of the total supply airdropped to the Solana community,\u201d the project\u2019s site reads.\n\n\u201cThe Bonk contributors were tired of toxic \u2018Alameda\u2019 tokenomics and wanted to make a fun memecoin where everyone gets a fair shot.\u201d\n\nBONK airdrop provides great excuse to try Solana\n\nBut, those concerns aside, why shouldn\u2019t BONK be BONK? Solana has been hit negatively in the last two months for reasons including FTX\u2019s implosion. (Investors should however do their own research before buying BONK, or any meme coin.)\n\nFormer FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was a vocal cheerleader and proponent of the blockchain, which has added to concerns about projects leaving the Solana ecosystem.\n\nRead more: Q&A: A Conversation With Solana Founders Raj and Anatoly\n\nThe network\u2019s native token SOL plunged to single digits for the first time in nearly two years last week, weighed down by its ties to Bankman-Fried.\n\nHis trading firm Alameda Research invested in Solana Labs\u2019 initial coin offering for SOL and held about $1.2 billion in SOL tokens at the time questions surrounding its balance sheet surfaced.\n\nMoreover, two super popular NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, recently decided to abandon ship and move to rival blockchains Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nSource: BONK\n\nBut now BONK is appearing to gain steam with major platforms such as NFT marketplace Magic Eden hinting at adopting the token, even though it has only been around less than two weeks.\n\nSolana naturally benefits from increased usage of its network, with Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko sharing a tutorial on how to use decentralized exchange Orca to trade BONK via Twitter.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token SOL has risen up to 36% this past week, according to data from TradingView, having outperformed the market since the start of the year.\n\nSolana may not have fully recovered from its FTX-laden woes, and a dog-themed coin won\u2019t fix everything. But, apparently, it doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
