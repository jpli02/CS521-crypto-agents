        "title": "Solana Apps May Soon be Ported to Cosmos Ecosystem - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Developers of Solana Web3 apps may soon be able to port their apps to the Cosmos ecosystem, creating new opportunities for users and providing a greater variety of uses for Cosmos blockchains. This information has been made available as a consequence of a recent announcement made by Injective (INJ), a developer of a network based on Cosmos. The Injective team has reportedly launched a layer-2 testnet that makes use of Solana's Sea Level Virtual Machine, as stated in the announcement that was made on the 30th of March (SVM). Because of this new advancement, certain Solana developers are now able to test their applications for usage in the Cosmos environment without having to switch either the programming language they use or the tools they use.\n\nThis marks a significant advancement for the Solana community as well as the Cosmos community. Developers can now reach a new audience and provide users with more opportunities to engage with their apps by porting Solana Web3 apps to the Cosmos ecosystem. This allows developers to expand their potential user base. In addition, the Cosmos ecosystem is able to capitalize on the benefits of Solana's high-speed and low-cost transactions, which positions it favorably in comparison to other blockchain ecosystems.\n\nEclipse, a company that offers specialized zero-knowledge and optimistic rollups for software developers, was enlisted to assist in the development of the brand new layer-2 testnet. Eclipse has been instrumental in the creation of this new layer by utilizing their expertise to develop a safe and effective layer-2 solution that enables the seamless integration of Solana Web3 applications into the Cosmos ecosystem. This solution was made possible thanks to Eclipse's contribution to the development of this new layer.\n\nThis brand new development is currently going through the testing phase, but it shows a lot of promise for the future of the Cosmos and Solana ecosystems. Because there will be more opportunities for cross-chain compatibility, developers will be able to create applications that are even more robust and innovative, and these applications will be able to take advantage of the distinctive characteristics of both Solana and Cosmos. As a consequence of this, the prospects for the future of the blockchain technology are more encouraging than they have ever been.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock\n\n. . .\n\nTags"

        "title": "Solana Options Protocol Cega Comes to Ethereum - Blockworks",
        "content": "Exotic derivatives protocol Cega Finance will be launching on Ethereum mainnet, branching out from its native Solana.\n\nIn traditional finance, exotic options fill the same role, more or less, as regular options \u2014 enabling leveraged longs and shorts on an underlying asset, but they can be used to achieve specific investment goals that cannot be accomplished with American or European options.\n\nFor example, Barrier options have a payoff that depends on whether the underlying asset price reaches a certain barrier level during the life of the option, while Asian options\u2019 payoff depends on the average price of the asset over a period of time.\n\n\u201cExotic options are a natural evolution in an economic market,\u201d Arisa Toyosaki, Cega Finance co-founder, told Blockworks. \u201cThey are a conditional option on top of a vanilla option.\u201d\n\nSeasoned investors can use exotic options to dial in risk preferences while trading a wider range of investment products.\n\nLeveraged options vaults\n\nCega also supports structured vault products pitched to enable yields during volatile market environments.\n\nThe protocol will be offering a leveraged options vault (LOV) strategy, expected to launch within the second quarter. This option will be offered on top of the products which are already available to those on the Solana blockchain.\n\nLOV is an options structured product that Toyosaki believes will resolve capital inefficiency in DeFi as it \u201cdoes not require additional liquidity accessed through redemptions of user-funded margins or overcollateralization.\u201d\n\nLOV\u2019s Gotta Go Fast offering, for example, offers a 21% to 30% APY. The underlying assets will be BTC, ETH and SOL, and Cega says it will offer a 50% principal protection barrier.\n\nToyosaki notes that in order to take a leverage position in the existing market, the amount of capital that must be staked \u2014 but never put to work \u2014 is significant.\n\n\u201cWe created a method for our leverage options vaults that is extremely capital efficient and allows you to get a leveraged return by having a combination of options which can maximize your appetite for the market,\u201d she said.\n\nLOV liquidations work like this, Blockworks Research analyst Ren Yu Kong explains:\n\nA user deposits crypto into a vault for a set time period of time \u2014 for example, 30 days; and\n\nif BTC, ETH, or SOL drop by over 50% across that period, then;\n\nthe 50% principal protection barrier has expired, requiring collateral to be taken.\n\n\u201cFrom there, the vault takes the worst-performing asset. Say BTC decreased by 30%, ETH decreased by 45%, SOL decreased by 60%. Then the vault will return 40% (100-60) of your initial deposit,\u201d Kong said.\n\nOn top of LOV, Cega is also launching a trading firm, Tras Mobian. The entity is designed to resolve one-sided demand issues in decentralized financial markets.\n\n\u201cIf you look at every DeFi option vault in the market, everyone is focused on selling options. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of demand for users buying options,\u201d Toyosaki said.\n\nThis is where Tras Mobian comes in. It will be focused on research and development in the space, according to Toyosaki, with the hopes of creating more demand for both sides of the market.\n\nTas Mobian will run independently of Cega, the company notes. A third-party custodian will manage its multisig and oversee its balance sheets and audits.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

She\u2019s determined to come up with a plan that will get her back home (and away from her molecular-biologist dad, who\u2019s job has made them move, and his involvement in GMOs might create even more trouble for her). Maybe she can go back with her grandparents when they come visit. Or maybe she can win the drawing competition that\u2019s offering a a plane ticket to any destination in the world as a grand prize.\n\nMeanwhile, though, she\u2019s stuck in seventh grade at an American school, where she has to communicate in English and get used to American ways of doing things. Worst of all, she faces antisemitism up close for the first time. But she also finds support and friendship where she least expected it and starts to see her new life with different eyes. Maybe home doesn\u2019t have to be the place she\u2019s always lived. Maybe home can be a place in the heart.\n\nEvents at the Del Mar Fairgrounds\n\nA variety of events are being held this month at the Del Mar Fairgrounds.
