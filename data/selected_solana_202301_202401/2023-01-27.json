        "content": "With the 344-unit Esperanza apartments now in lease up next to the Metro L Line's Duarte Station, developer MBK Rental Living has turned its attention to a site next door.\n\nRecently, Irvine-based MBK commenced construction of Solana, the second phase of a master-planned project along Fasana Road just east of Duarte Road. Plans call for a five-story building containing a total of 292 studio, one-, two-, three-, and four-bedroom apartments, wrapping around an eight-story parking garage.\n\nTCA Architects is designing Solana, which is depicted in a rendering as a contemporary wood-frame structure.\n\nAccording to a landing page on the website or general contractor R.D. Olson Construction, the apartments will be accompanied by amenities including courtyards, a pool, a spa, club rooms, and a fitness center.\n\nMBK, a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Mitsui & Co., acquired the project site in early 2021 through a joint venture with Haseko Corporation.\n\nSolana and Esperanza also sit across the L Line tracks from the 110-acre City of Hope campus, which is poised to undergo an expansion that will increase its patient capacity by 1,000 and its employment base by 1,500 through the 2030s.\n\nFollow us on social media:\n\nTwitter / Facebook / LinkedIn"

        "title": "Aptos Surge Triggers Flashbacks of Ripple's 2017 Bull Run - Blockworks",
        "content": "Layer-1 Aptos has seen the price of its token, APT, soar by 460% since the start of the year.\n\nPreviously dubbed the \u2018Solana Killer,\u2019 proof-of-stake network Aptos promised to create a fast and cheap blockchain that would enable NFTs, DAOs and DeFi activity but fell short when it launched in October last year.\n\nOnly 50 active developers are currently active on Aptos, according to data from TokenTerminal. Its number of daily active users currently sits around 31,000.\n\nDespite these numbers, Aptos\u2019 fully diluted valuation (FDV) is significantly greater than that of other blockchains, including Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, and Optimism, Blockworks Research Senior Analyst Dan Smith said.\n\nAptos\u2019 recent price surge correlated with the deployment of the decentralized exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap on its blockchain two weeks ago \u2014 the DEX makes up a total of $33.26 million in TVL on Aptos \u2014 almost 60% of the entire Aptos TVL, according to DefiLama.\n\n\u201cThe lack of development is obvious in the on-chain liquidity, which mostly resides on a non-native DEX \u2014 PancakeSwap \u2014 in the form of non-native tokens such as USDC, BUSD, WETH,\u201d Smith said.\n\nProjects often run a series of testnets with developers who are building on their network before mainnet launches. That \u201ccreates a community of developers and users before the token launch, which is undeniably a more ethical process,\u201d Smith added. Aptos ran four testnets in 2022 before launching on mainnet.\n\nSo why is the network with few users and developers seeing such a huge increase in its token\u2019s price?\n\nNearly 400 articles about Aptos were published in the weeks leading up to its 460% rally | Chart by David Canellis\n\nThe South Korean market\n\nThe price rally of Aptos parallels the beginning of \u201cXangle Blockchain Foundation Week\u201d in South Korea, where the project has been heavily promoted.\n\nIn fact, Aptos\u2019 focus on the South Korean market has always been intentional. A Twitter user who goes by the pseudonym DataaRocks noted in a series of tweets that the company had released a Korean language version of its white paper and partnered with local gaming company Npixel in November last year to launch METAPIXEL.\n\nIt is also preparing to launch its world tour hackathon in Seoul, DataaRocks said.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThis momentum, however, is reminiscent of Ripple\u2019s run in 2017, Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in a report.\n\n\u201cThis reminds \u2018Matrix on Target\u2019 of XRP Ripple, which had 50% of [its] trading volume driven by Korean retail investors during the 2017 peak when the token went 10x in a matter of weeks,\u201d Thielen said in a report.\n\nShort positions\n\nIt is also likely that many traders are looking to short APT, Thielen said, noting that over the past 48 hours, price movements have been driven by two large short squeezes.\n\n\u201cBy far, the largest volume comes from ByBit for Aptos, which is estimated to have its web traffic source from Russia [at] 19% and Korea [at] 14%,\u201d he said.\n\nFunding rates for APT perpetual futures have also been trading negatively, indicative of heavy short interest. According to information on Coinalyze, Aptos\u2019 funding rate fell sharply on Jan. 25 and Jan. 26, before leveling out once the price spiked.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Why Can Cosmos (ATOM) Not Grow as Ethereum Killer? - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCosmos (ATOM) is one of the Ethereum (ETH) competitors with one of the best market capitalizations. However, it has failed to draw much attention to itself and is losing the popularity contest and capital to other so-called \u201cEthereum killer\u201d networks such as Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX).\n\nCosmos had its launch in 2019 and was developed to be an ecosystem where multiple networks can talk to each other, as well as overcome the scalability and interoperability problems that affect many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and its rival Ethereum.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is built around a hub-based architecture, where each hub is an independent blockchain that acts as a bridge between other networks. This allows different cryptocurrencies to be exchanged and used with each other without the need for a centralized crypto exchange, strengthening the idea of an ecosystem free of a centralizer.\n\nBut why does Cosmos not grow like an Ethereum killer?\n\nFirst of all, Cosmos solves the problem of lack of communication between networks only in its ecosystem or hubs. Thus, not just any blockchain can reach Cosmos and exchange smart contracts, for example. This breaks the expectation that Cosmos could be a powerful Layer 0 network.\n\nAnother factor hindering Cosmos\u2019 growth is the value of the token to its ecosystem. You have probably heard that developing on the Ethereum blockchain is expensive and that fees are paid through the network\u2019s native token, ETH. However, the same importance that Ether has for the leading smart contract platform, ATOM does not have for Cosmos.\n\nOn the altcoin network, appchains can create their own logic, which makes ATOM unnecessary since this technology runs its sovereign blockchain instead of a smart contract implemented on another chain.\n\nMoreover, the ATOM community is far removed from the supporters of other ETH rivals such as Solana and Cardano. The community around it is very important for a cryptocurrency because, without it, hardly any project \u2014 even a serious one like Cosmos \u2014 can survive.Without being able to attract more of an audience to itself, the cryptocurrency may continue to lose ground not only to smart contract platforms but also to altcoins with no real value proposition, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nDoes this mean that Cosmos is a bad project?\n\nNo. The altcoin, even though it needs to overcome some challenges, remains in the top 10 assets with the most development activity, proving that its network is growing and that more people may soon use it.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, although it is not one of the cryptocurrencies with a large community, Cosmos is regularly present on social media, something that is also very important.\n\nIn addition, it has made important partnerships, and blockchain industry projects are using its network. A great example of this is the arrival of the DeFi dYdX protocol on its blockchain.\n\nOther advantages of Cosmos are:"

        "title": "Bitcoin world's most hated cryptocurrency - Fox Business",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s precipitous plunge in price helped it become the world\u2019s the most hated virtual currency in 2022, according to a survey by crypto education website Coin Kickoff.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value was the most disliked coin in 16 countries, led by Canada, Qatar and Finland.\n\nEthereum and solana were the world\u2019s most loved, led by Indonesia, Russia and Uzbekistan.\n\nCoin Kickoff came up with its love/hate ranking by analyzing more than 835,000 Twitter posts with the artificial intelligence algorithm HuggingFace.\n\nBitcoin lost 70% of its value in 2022, causing investors to vent their frustration on social media. Ethereum, crypto\u2019s second-largest currency, fell almost as much, dropping by 67.5%, but was spared the backlash.\n\nCoin Kickoff noted, in contrast to bitcoin, many of ethereum\u2019s projects are based around decentralized finance (DeFi) \u2014 which aims to broaden the usage of cryptocurrencies for more complex transactions such as loans.\n\nSolana was also loved, despite losing 94% of its value. Its network suffered over five outages, numerous hacks and fallout from FTX\u2019s bankruptcy with FTX and sister company Alameda Trading holding 10.7% of its tokens, according to Coin Telegraph.\n\nBRUTAL YEAR FOR BITCOIN AND ALMOST $3B IN CRYPTO HACKS MARKED 2022: REPORT\n\nRecent rally\n\nSentiment for bitcoin may improve with its recent price recovery.\n\nIan Wright, the crypto expert behind Coin Kickoff, told FOX Business: \"While it is still 67% down on its all-time high, investors are confident that the current economic climate in the U.S. and bitcoin\u2019s standing as the pre-eminent crypto coin will yield further gains as the year progresses.\"\n\nFxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich was more cautious. \"Despite the positive performance of the U.S. stock indices, bitcoin continued its unsuccessful attempts to consolidate above $23,000 on Wednesday. The crypto market has, at least, paused after rallying since the beginning of the year,\" he said.\n\nWright added that investors will look to see whether etherum can hit $5,000 in 2023.\n\n\"Like bitcoin, its value is rallying as a result of economic conditions. It is still highly regarded within the U.S. crypto community because of its long-term potential and the blockchain base for many of the industry\u2019s most exciting prospects,\" he told FOX Business.\n\nSolana is benefiting from bonk, a new coin launched on its blockchain in December. Bonk rocketed 5,000% by early January, but has since fallen back, though it was up 910% year-to-date as of last week.\n\nSurprisingly, bitcoin was not America\u2019s most hated virtual currency.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS LAUNCHING DIGITAL ASSET SUBCOMMITTEE AFTER TROUBLED YEAR FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY INDUSTRY\n\nAmerica\u2019s Top 5 hated by percentage of negative tweets:\n\n1. Axie Infinity (32.34%) lost 90% of its value in 2022. Hackers stole $625 million from its Ronin Network and the player base for its games dwindled due to competition for virtual 3D worlds.\n\n2. 1inch Network (31.59%) saw its value peak in 2021 at almost $7.50 against the dollar. Its performance was much more sluggish in 2022 as a result of the wider turmoil in the crypto market.\n\n3. Terra (27.35%) was one of crypto\u2019s high-profile casualties of 2022. Despite a promising introduction where startup Terraform Labs secured $200 million in funding, the blockchain collapsed in May 2022 \u2014 wiping out $45 billion of market capitalization in a week. Its founders Do Kwon and Daniel Shin have been sued in Singapore, Korea and the U.S. for alleged financial irregularities, and authorities in Seoul issued an arrest warrant for Shin in November 2022.\n\n4. Uniswap (22.00%) peaked at $42 against the dollar and has yet to see its value move past the $10 mark.\n\n5. Holochain (21.24%) is billed as a more ethical alternative to the centralized crypto offerings. Holo allows customers to make their own choices and create more transparency around its blockchain technology. However, the coin is still valued at just $0.02 against the dollar.\n\nCRYPTO.COM CUTS 20% OF STAFF, CITING ECONOMIC HURDLES AND FTX COLLAPSE\n\nAmerica\u2019s Top 5 most loved by percentage of positive tweets\n\n1. Stellar (68.72%) partnered with Ukraine\u2019s government in 2021 to develop its digital infrastructure. The coin\u2019s value increased further when Franklin Templeton became the first investment firm to launch a \u2018tokenized\u2019 mutual fund in the U.S. using Stellar\u2019s blockchain.\n\n2. EOS (64.29%) gained popularity for its versatility, open-source capability and intuitive user-friendly platform that helps developers and investors. That transparency and accessibility makes it a favorite for investors.\n\n3. Decentraland (53.89%) has the largest metaverse currently online. Many predict that its coin will reach parity with the dollar in 2023. Mainstream interest in the platform from brands including Adidas, Dolce & Gabbana, Samsung, Sothebys, and Tommy Hilfiger make it feel more relatable as a concept for the wider public.\n\n4. NEAR Protocol (53.03%) reached record highs at the start of 2023. Many investors believe it has some of the most reliable technology on the market, with an active developer community and emphasis on security.\n\n5. Ravencoin (51.76%) as a peer-to-peer platform offers more coin versatility than its rivals.\n\nReuters contributed to this report."

        "title": "Top 5 crypto projects leading the pack in terms of developer activity - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "There are multiple indicators that traders and investors use to analyse a crypto project before they put their money behind it. These indicators provide relevant information about the status of a project, its future price action and whether or not it is attracting interest from the masses. A network\u2019s developer activity is one of these metrics.Developers are the core of a blockchain project. They build incredible applications that generate interesting use cases and attract people to the blockchain. This usually leads to price momentum, which draws even more developers to the project, and the cycle continues.Here\u2019s a look at the blockchain networks with the most developer activity in recent times.At the top of the list is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH). A report by Electric Capital, a leading venture capital firm, indicated that there were 1,873 full-time developers active on the network in 2022. That was the highest amongst all blockchains last year.Further, according to Santiment data, the leading altcoin blockchain is off to a good start in 2023 as well, coming in ninth in terms of developer activity since the year began. As per the report, Ethereum saw 219 notable GitHub commits to the network\u2019s open-source code since 2023 began.Developer activity could spike further, with Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai update scheduled to take place later this year. This much-anticipated update will allow users to withdraw staked ETH and their accrued staking rewards.According to Electric Capital, the second largest project in terms of developer activity in 2022 was Polkadot (DOT). As per the report, there were 752 full-time developers working on the network. Polkadot has continued this momentum into 2023 as well. Per Santiment data, the platform has seen the highest developer activity since the start of the year. The network saw 441 notable GitHub commits to its open-source code YTD.Polkadot also has ambitious plans for 2023. The network is gearing up for the Asynchronous Backing Upgrade, which is supposed to increase throughput on the network. After the upgrade, the network should be able to process between 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) and 1,000,000 TPS without compromising the network security.The Cosmos blockchain registered the third-highest developer activity in 2022. As per the report, there were 511 full-time developers working on the network. Cosmos also has an ambitious roadmap for 2023, which could see further increases in developer activity.The first major upgrade is the Interchain Security Rollout, followed by the v8-Rho Upgrade, the v9-Lambda Upgrade, the v10-Epsilon, and the v11-Gamma upgrades. All these upgrades will roll out through 2023, projecting healthy developer activity for Cosmos in the coming months.As such, Santiment data shows that Cosmos has the sixth-highest developer activity in 2023, with 258 notable GitHub commits to its source code. This could be one of the reasons why Cosmos (ATOM) has witnessed a significant price increase since the beginning of the year. At the time of writing, ATOM was changing hands at $12.97, after experiencing a 37 percent increase YTD.As per the Electric Capital report, there were 383 full-time developers working on Solana at the end of 2022. The number of developers on the platform has grown 10X since 2018, with a further 83 percent jump in 2022. However, the FTX collapse caused SOL prices to plummet, leading to several Solana projects moving to other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and Polygon.Fortunately, Solana has made a significant comeback in 2023. At the time of writing, SOL had gained 139 percent YTD. Moreover, the platform has a host of upgrades planned for the rest of the year, starting from the Solana Mobile Stack, an Android-compatible mobile device named the Solana Phone.Other upgrades include the Firedancer and other network upgrades such as QUIC, Stake-weighted QoS, and Local free markets. These upgrades could see Solana\u2019s developer activity rise once again.Bitcoin (BTC), often termed the King Coin, is still the market leader a market capitalisation of $436 billion at the time of writing. The world\u2019s oldest blockchain network also came in fifth in terms of developer activity last year. According to the Electric Capital report, there were 300 developers working on the network in 2022.Bitcoin experienced a devastating bear phase throughout the previous year. The world\u2019s oldest cryptocurrency dropped to $15,000 from its peak of $65,000 in November 2021. However, BTC has made a significant recovery in 2023, rising from its $16,000-post-FTX range to reach $23,014.74 at the time of writing. That translates to a 40 percent increase since the start of the year.As per the Electric Capital report, there were 23,343 monthly active developers working in the crypto industry as of 2022. That equates to a 297 percent increase since 2018; an encouraging sign for the crypto industry.Some other notable mentions from Electric Capital\u2019s report include Polygon, Kusama, NEAR, Cardano, and Tezos. This is in line with Santiment data, which puts Kusama and Cardano in first and third place, respectively, in terms of developer activity since the start of 2023.Metaverse project Decentraland (MANA) and web3 messaging app Status (SNT) bring up the fourth and fifth positions, as per Santiment findings.It is also worth noting that all these coins have posted significant gains since the start of 2023. Thus, developer activity can provide a fair insight into a project\u2019s future valuation.However, this is not the only metric one should look at when evaluating a blockchain network. There are plenty of other technical and fundamental indicators that should be examined.Moreover, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and prices can fluctuate wildly despite the strongest indicators. Therefore, you should do your own research and invest only as much as you can afford to lose completely."
