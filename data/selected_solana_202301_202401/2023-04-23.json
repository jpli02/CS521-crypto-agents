        "title": "Solana's Isolated Fee Markets in Action - Delphi Digital",
        "content": "Solana had its most hyped mint of the year on Friday and went off without a hitch. Compare this to even just a year ago when NFT mints and IDOs would render the chain unusable. TPS this time didn\u2019t even flinch.\n\nEven after the mint the chain continued to perform exceptionally well all while the NFT collection was doing numbers, at one point doing more sales volume than the next 9 projects combined. Fees stayed low and DeFi was unaffected. This is a materially different outcome than we are accustomed to seeing on other blockchains. Remember the BAYC land sale? Gas prices spiked to >$1k and rendered the chain unusable for an entire day, even sending L2 gas costs on Optimism to $50 for a brief period of time.\n\nPriority fees worked as expected, but even still barely spiked. In a bull market we\u2019ll get to see mints like this combined with active DeFi trading, and that\u2019s when the true test will come and we\u2019ll really get to see how effective Solana\u2019s fee markets are. For now, they\u2019re still largely not needed.\n\nTo visualize the demand further we can look no further than Tensor\u2019s historical trade volume. Tensor is the fastest growing NFT trading platform on Solana and is quickly becoming the preferred destination to trade.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to be excited about with Solana. Their flagship phone Saga is starting to ship, it\u2019s quickly becoming the chain for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) with projects like Hivemapper, recently migrated Helium and upcoming Render, Jump Engineering\u2019s new Firedancer validator at the end of the year, Backpack and their new xNFT standard, and all the recent improvements over the past year like Quic, stake weighted QoS, and localized fee markets all starting to shine through.\n\nSolana\u2019s still looked down upon or misunderstood in the public discourse. Yes, it has high hardware requirements to validate, but no blockchain can ignore this and just needs to shift these high requirements *somewhere else* instead. I would highly recommend giving this 3 minute read from Alex Beckett at Celestia for more context. In Solana\u2019s case, diet clients and Tinydancer are their path towards cheap verification.\n\nI believe Solana is still largely under-appreciated for what it\u2019s been able to achieve. It was only 4 months ago where people were legitimately saying the ecosystem was dead and would never return. Meanwhile, the people who stuck around have formed a cult like dedication to it and have been improving it day in and day out. I don\u2019t think public perception has really changed yet, but maybe this weekend starts to shift it a bit in that direction. If I had to guess, by the back half of the year the perception around Solana will be much different. Slowly but surely people will wake up. Even if you disagree with some of Solana\u2019s design choices, there\u2019s a lot that other ecosystems can learn and take away from it."

        "content": "Between these two top smart contract blockchains, it's clear which is a better investment.\n\nSince Ethereum (ETH 0.94%) was created in 2015 it has radically altered the cryptocurrency landscape. Thanks to an innovation known as smart contracts, developers could create blockchain-based applications that automatically run and transfer value when certain criteria are met.\n\nInitially, Ethereum was the only smart-contract-capable blockchain, but in recent years this has changed. New blockchains have come into existence that not only offer smart contract functionality, but also a slew of other features hoping to build off of Ethereum.\n\nOne of those blockchains is Solana (SOL 0.30%), a blazingly fast smart contract blockchain that has a considerable user base and is the 10th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap. Many believe Solana could eventually outdo Ethereum as the premier smart contract blockchain, but those hopes might be greatly inflated.\n\nA looming problem\n\nFirst, let's address the elephant in the room: Solana's multiple outages. Over the past year, Solana has experienced at least six network outages, including the most recent one in February where the blockchain was down for more than 18 hours, disrupting a number of exchanges and apps running on the network.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum has a proven track record of stability and reliability. Ethereum's network has been operating smoothly for years, even with the increasing demand for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nThe undisputed DeFi champ\n\nAnother key factor to consider when comparing Ethereum and Solana is the total value locked (TVL) metric. TVL is an important measure of the adoption and usage of a blockchain in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Since DeFi functionality is one of the primary use cases for both Ethereum and Solana, evaluating TVL can be an easy way to compare the two.\n\nEthereum utterly dominates the decentralized finance (DeFi) market with a TVL of more than $31 billion, compared to Solana's TVL of just over $292 million. That means Ethereum supports 100 times more value in DeFi than Solana. Clearly, the competition isn't even close and demonstrates the greater adoption and usage of Ethereum's network in the DeFi market. From this perspective, Ethereum is a much more attractive investment option for those looking to tap into the growing DeFi niche.\n\nSpeed isn't everything\n\nFans of Solana often say that it has some of the fastest transaction speeds. While this is true, it distorts the purpose of a blockchain. One of the primary reasons blockchain technology is so profound is because it allows users to transfer value in a decentralized and secure fashion. While Solana prioritizes speed, it sacrifices higher levels of decentralization and security found in Ethereum.\n\nAlthough many are quick to point out that Ethereum moves at a snail's pace compared to Solana, they also fail to realize that there is serious progress being made to narrow this gap thanks to new solutions known as Layer 2s.\n\nThrough the use of Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum, Ethereum is transformed into a lightning-fast network, while also maintaining its decentralized and secure nature. As these solutions continue to be developed and adopted, Ethereum's competitive advantage over Solana will likely become even more apparent.\n\nThe big picture\n\nSo, what does this mean for investors looking to pick between Solana and Ethereum? Although Solana may seem like a tempting option with its impressive speed, the lack of value it supports in DeFi and the sacrifices in decentralization and security make it a riskier investment, especially considering it still remains down more than 90% from its all time high.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a proven track record and a solid foundation in the decentralized finance market. Its market dominance, along with the development of Layer 2 solutions, makes it a safer and more promising investment for those looking for long-term growth."
