        "content": "In an interview with CoinDesk, Livington spun KIN\u2019s regulatory baggage as a positive: \"KIN is the only token that's on Solana that has no inflation that's been through the SEC gauntlet.\" The idea is that it has been given a green-light for trading in the U.S., and is, in Livingston\u2019s view, better suited for adoption as a payment method than similar virtual currencies that have yet to get regulatory clearance. (The SEC\u2019s case against KIN wasn\u2019t all that dissimilar from the one currently underway with Ripple, albeit at a much smaller scale.)"
