        "content": "Solana Below $10: The Solana price has been falling not just for the past 30 days but also for the last 6 months. The last Solana ATH ($258.93) was set in the first week of Nov 2021. Unfortunately for Solana supporters and developers, it is not clear where the project is heading as the network's underlying cryptocurrency lost an enormous 96% from the ATH, practically making the assets worthless and bringing losses to investors that they will not be able to recover. At the time of writing, Solana's price was $9.91 and looking at the current state it is expected that the price will fall below $5."

        "content": "By EWN \u2022 Published: 01 Jan 2023 \u2022 11:45\n\nIn recent years, the rise of cryptocurrency has brought about a new era in finance and technology. Many cryptocurrencies have gained significant value and have brought numerous benefits to their users.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG), Solana (SOL), and Toncoin (TON) are one of the few cryptocurrencies that have gained attention for their innovative features and remain just under $15 as of now- making them phenomenal options for those looking to invest on budget.\n\nCan Solana take over its competitors with such benefits?\n\nSolana (SOL) is a decentralised network that aims to provide fast and secure transactions at scale. It is designed to be a scalable platform for decentralised applications and smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralised applications on top of their blockchain. Solana boasts high transaction speeds and can process over 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nSolana is known for its low transaction fees, which make it an affordable platform for developers and users. It also strongly focuses on security and decentralisation, with a decentralised governance system to let users participate in its voting. It is also one of the most environmentally friendly blockchains, using only a fraction of the energy used by other projects.\n\nThe total token supply for Solana is limited to 990 million tokens, with a small percentage of new tokens being released each year to fund ongoing development and support the network.\n\nWhat purpose does Toncoin Serve?\n\nToncoin (TON) is a cryptocurrency that aims to revolutionise how people interact and transact online. It was developed by the team behind the popular messaging app Telegram and utilized a unique blockchain technology known as \u201cInstant Hypercube Routing.\u201d This technology allows for lightning-fast transactions and high scalability, making it suitable for various applications such as payments, messaging, file sharing, and more.\n\nTON focuses on privacy and security, with features such as end-to-end encryption and secure messaging. The max supply of TON is limited to 5 billion tokens, with a portion of these being released through an initial coin offering and the rest being reserved for future development and distribution.\n\nWhat makes Big Eyes Coin better than other Meme Tokens?\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a token currently being sold through its presale and has reached stage 7. Its presale has been a great success, raising over $11.8 Million. Moreover, it operates on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain and is an ERC-20 token, allowing it to benefit from the many changes brought about by the Ethereum Merge.\n\nAdditionally, BIG aims to launch its NFTs alongside its custom-themed merchandise to sell to its fans.\n\nBIG holds a large total supply of tokens, 200 billion, which is planned for different purposes. 20% of the complete supply will be distributed to exchanges, 70% will be sold in public presale, 5% will be donated to charities for improving oceans, and the remaining 5% will be used for marketing.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Presale: How To Purchase\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is currently being sold through its presale, and purchasing it is very uncomplicated:\n\nMake a wallet on MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Choose a purchasing method to buy BIG, such as USDT, BNB, and ETH. Confirm your order and wait for the end of the presale season to collect your tokens from the Big Eyes Coin (BIG) website.\n\nThe purchased tokens can be collected once the presale ends. Additionally, users who use code BIGsave681 will receive a 5% BIG token bonus upon receiving their tokens, so don\u2019t miss out!\n\nIn conclusion, these cryptocurrencies are great examples that may offer unique benefits and are valued at a relatively low price point. However, they may not remain at this price for long once the market uptrends, and they collect a larger user base.\n\nFor more information on Big Eyes Coin (BIG), you can visit the following links:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nSponsored\n\nWARNING: The investment in crypto assets is not regulated, it may not be suitable for retail investors and the total amount invested could be lost\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE: La inversi\u00f3n en criptoactivos no est\u00e1 regulada, puede no ser adecuada para inversores minoristas y perderse la totalidad del importe invertido"
