Discover SCENE\n\nThe popular trading app Robinhood is ending support for three cryptocurrencies in Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) from June 27, 2023.\n\n\"We regularly review the crypto we offer on Robinhood,\" the firm shared in an update. \"Based on our latest review, we\u2019ve decided to end support for Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) on June 27th, 2023 at 6:59 PM ET.\"\n\nUsers have to withdraw or sell these assets for fiat or other eligible assets on Robinhood by the deadline.\n\nPost that, these assets will be sold at market prices with the sale proceeds going toward the users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPer data from CoinGecko, the price of all three assets has been mixed with ADA falling 2.7%, MATIC dropping 0.4%, and SOL rising 1.1% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe decision comes days after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and Coinbase for a variety of allegations, with securities law violations being common between the two charges brought by the regulator.\n\nBoth the lawsuits alleged that ADA, MATIC, and SOL were unregistered securities.\n\n\"This introduced a cloud of uncertainty around these assets and, as a result, our team has decided to end support for them,\" a Robinhood spokesperson shared with Decrypt. A similar message was issued to some of Robinhood's user base this morning.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDan Gallagher, Robinhood\u2019s regulatory compliance head also testified before the House Agriculture Committee on Tuesday claiming that the firm was \u201cactively reviewing\u201d its crypto offerings.\n\nThe trading app added support for Solana and Polygon in April 2022 with Cardano\u2019s listing coming in September 2022.\n\nRobinhood will support three fewer crypto tokens from its initial list of 18 which includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), layer-1 tokens like Avalanche (AVAX) and Tezos (XTZ), and DeFi tokens like Aave (AAVE), Compound (COMP), and Uniswap (UNI)."

        "content": "Robinhood (HOOD) has decided to delist certain crypto assets from its trading platform after the Securities and Exchange Commission deemed them unregistered securities.\n\nCardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) will be delisted after being named in SEC lawsuits filed this week against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase (COIN). The lawsuits are part of a broader SEC effort to regulate cryptocurrency.\n\nKey Takeaways Crypto assets ADA, MATIC, and SOL will be delisted from Robinhood on June 27.\n\nUsers who still have ADAM, MATIC, or SOL in their Robinhood accounts on June 27 will have those assets automatically sold on the market.\n\nThe move by Robinhood comes days after these three crypto assets were referred to as unregistered securities by the SEC in lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThe Solana Foundation and Cardano development firm IOG have disputed the characterizations of Solana and Cardano as securities.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For Your Investments?\n\nRobinhood will cease trading of ADA, MATIC, and SOL on June 27. Any customers who have those three crypto assets in their Robinhood accounts at the time of the removal will have them automatically sold on the market.\n\nThat said, users are able to simply withdraw their ADA, MATIC, and SOL prior to the delisting if they'd rather not have the assets sold. However, the ability to withdraw those crypto assets is not available in every state.\n\nAlthough not explicitly mentioned in the announcement, this move from Robinhood appears to be a direct response to the recent SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, as the three crypto assets targeted for removal from the platform were referred to as unregistered securities in those complaints.\n\nOn Thursday, the Solana Foundation dismissed the claim that SOL is a security, stating it is a community-driven project that relies on decentralized engagement from users and developers.\n\nCardano's development company IOG has similarly disputed the notion that ADA is a security. There have been no public comments from any entity associated with Polygon on the matter.\n\nOther crypto assets that were referred to as securities in the lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase include but aren't limited to BNB Chain (BNB), Binance USD (BUSD), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), Algorand (ALGO), Internet Computer (ICP), and Dash (DASH).\n\nAdditionally, SEC enforcement actions have been taken against a number of crypto projects directly such as Augur (REP) and Tron (TRX).\n\n"

        "title": "Robinhood to delist tokens for Solana, Cardano, and Polygon after SEC suits name them as securities - Fortune",
        "content": "Dan Gallagher, Robinhood\u2019s chief legal officer, testified before the House Agriculture Committee on Tuesday that the stock trading app was \u201cactively reviewing\u201d tokens the Securities and Exchange Commission deemed were securities in lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.\n\nOn Friday, Robinhood, which recently expanded into crypto, said in an update on its website that it will delist Solana\u2019s SOL, Cardano\u2019s ADA, and Polygon\u2019s MATIC beginning June 27 at 6:59 p.m. ET. Users will be able to buy and sell the tokens up until the end of June. However, come then, any existing tokens in a user\u2019s wallet \u201cwill be sold for market value.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarlier this week the SEC sued crypto companies Binance and Coinbase and alleged that a number of cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities. This includes Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Cardano (ADA), which are currently supported on the Robinhood Crypto platform,\u201d the company wrote in a message to its users. \u201cThis introduced a cloud of uncertainty around these assets, and as a result, our team has decided to end support for them.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Polygon Labs did not immediately return a request for comment. Neither did the Solana or Cardano foundations, but in a statement issued to Fortune yesterday, a spokesperson for Solana said it \u201cstrongly believes that SOL is not a security.\u201d\n\nPrices of those tokens didn\u2019t move significantly after Robinhood notified its users on Friday morning. However, since the SEC singled out Solana, Polygon, and Cardano earlier this week, their prices have plummeted. SOL was down approximately 12% from Monday to Thursday afternoon. MATIC was also down about 12%, and ADA dropped 5%. The three tokens are in the top 10 in total market capitalization among all cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe sudden pivot in the fortunes of Solana, Polygon, and Cardano follow the SEC\u2019s two blockbuster lawsuits on Monday and Tuesday. In its suit against Binance, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said: \u201cThrough 13 charges, we allege that [CEO Changpeng] Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law.\u201d\n\nIn less aggressive language, Gensler also said that Coinbase did not comply with U.S. securities law. \u201cCoinbase\u2019s alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection by the SEC,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nCentral to both lawsuits are the agency\u2019s allegations that 13 tokens, which include SOL, ADA, and MATIC, are securities. Others singled out were SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO."
