While stability issues have always been my top concern with Solana, their focus on fixing such issues this year makes me believe this is a great contender for cryptos that could 10x by 2025.\n\nSolana has a lot of potential to become a leader in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, as it offers low fees, scalability, and interoperability with other blockchains. It is capturing a lot of the non-fungible token market share from Ethereum, and once the project figures out its stability issues, I believe more developers are likely to migrate.\n\nStill, Ethereum remains the top dog, and fees are very low.

Simply put, it can combine the best aspects of both Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, I believe a lot of patience is needed here. That primarily concerns the lack of marketing. But as blockchain development continues to advance, the flexibility and interoperability offered by this project will make it very appealing.\n\nNervos Network is currently trading with a market cap of over $120 million and that leaves a lot of room for upside.\n\nStorj (STORJ)\n\nAn image of a hand holding a cell phone with several visualizations of digital building blocks floating above it. representing sto platforms\n\nSource: Marko Aliaksandr/ShutterStock.com\n\nStorj (STORJ-USD) is similar to Filecoin (FIL-USD), as it buys data storage from individuals worldwide with its STORJ token and then resells it in bulk to others.
