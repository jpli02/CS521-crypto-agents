        "title": "SHIB Rival BONK May Get Burned via Solana Phone, Hints Official Account - U.Today",
        "content": "The first batch of Solana phones, called Saga, has been delivered to the first customers. As expected, it is a complete Android-compatible smartphone with additional features to interact with the Solana blockchain. That said, it is possible that Saga could do even more of what has been announced when it comes to BONK, which the official Solana Mobile account has hinted at the possibility of burning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay tuned \u2014 Solana Mobile (@solanamobile) January 4, 2023\n\nApart from the possible burning of Bonk Inu token through Solana's phone features, the official Twitter account has also hinted at the possibility of purchasing Saga for a meme token.\n\nWhat's up with Bonk Inu and BONK burning?\n\nBonk Inu (BONK) is a new meme coin, a kind of successor to Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), but on Solana. Despite the fact that the hype around it grew no more than a week ago, the token has already managed to grow by 5.351%. At the same time, it is being actively promoted by various Solana-based projects and even official blockchain accounts.\n\nLike Shiba Inu, BONK has a monstrously huge token supply of 99.185 trillion. As with SHIB, the Bonk Inu token is proposed to be burned, thereby reducing the number of zeros after the decimal point in its price.\n\nTo date, 815 billion BONKs have been burned, more than half of which were destined for Solana's most popular NFT collection, the DeGods team. However, as U.Today wrote, the DeGods team moved to other blockchains after failing to reach an agreement with Solana, and the Bonk Inu team responded by burning their BONKs."

        "content": "BONK has recorded a growth of 3034.4% over the past week and is trading at $0.00000280.\n\nShiba Inu has grown by as much as 10,533,193.25% since its All-Time Low.\n\nTo keen observers in the digital currency ecosystem, the name Bonk (BONK) must have been ringing a bell. The memecoin is a Solana-based digital currency that is now being paraded as a viable Shiba Inu (SHIB) killer. The coin boasts itself as the first dog token on Solana and with its targeted milestones and growing community, it has recorded impressive price strides over the past 7 days.\n\nFor the coin that hasrecently been launched, BONK has recorded a growth of 3034.4% over the past week and is trading at $0.00000280 per data from CoinMarketCap. Its growth has been tapering down over the past 24 hours but it remains the most vibrant memecoin this year by ecosystem activities, functional partnerships, and trading volumes.\n\nAs a memecoin, BONK boasts of a circulating supply of 56 trillion tokens atop a total supply of 100 trillion. As customary to memecoins and most decentralized protocols, BONK has infused in it a burn mechanism that recently saw as much as 500 billion tokens.\n\nIn its proceeding burn events, there are chances that the Solana Phone Saga may support the burning mechanism. The phone was introduced last year and its first set of orders has been shipped across the world. As a Solana-based smartphone, Saga can support a significant number of events on the blockchain.\n\nThe official Solana Mobile account on Twitter shared the hints on its official account when it tweeted a question asking its followers if they will purchase the phone using BONK tokens. A follower with the username @DoubleDCH said he will consider buying the phone if Solana Mobile will consider burning a portion of the tokens they will earn through the sales.\n\nIn response, the Solana Mobile account tweeted \u201cstay tuned.\u201d\n\nIs BONK Token Investment Worth the Hype?\n\nMemecoins are generally known to be the most volatile of digital currencies, a feature that contributes to their growth and also mars them.\n\nWhen compared to Shiba Inu which has grown by as much as 10,533,193.25% since its All-Time Low (ATL) of $0.000000000082 attained back in September 2020, the future looks bright when projected for the long term. Shiba Inu\u2019s growth is still as high despite the almost year-long crypto winter that has dampened the prices of most digital assets.\n\nWith the gloom that is currently in the broader industry, retail investors are keenly looking for a new thrill to invest their cash in. The sentiment favors BONK which has amassed more than 70,000 followers on Twitter in its short stint. As the pioneering memecoin on Solana, the coin will have the first mover advantage as other competing tokens might spring up.\n\nWhile Crypto-News Flash is not endorsing an investment in BONK tokens, chances are there that the memecoin will trail its existing coins in their moments of bullish runs, thus increasing the likelihood that investors now can get a good return for their investments post-crypto winter era."

        "content": "We may only be less than a week into the new year, but developments in the Solana blockchain have been one of the biggest stories so far. Following a December that saw them trading below double digits, the coin has hit a 40+% weekly surge to $13.50. The question remains, is 2023 truly a Solana Renaissance?\n\nNot only has it fought through a rigid cryptocurrency winter but also contagion from the infamous collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Still, the year has started with a 50% increase in active users, which could be a sign of a resurgence. It may also simply be Solana \u201chopium\u201d that comes with the optimistic perspective of a new year.\n\nThe FTX Conundrum\n\nSource: Yahoo Finance\n\nFor any kind of return to favor for Solana, there was the necessity for the blockchain to weather the storm provided by FTX. It was the biggest financial disaster in crypto history and among the largest financial crimes ever recorded.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the mastermind behind the massive fraud case, was a known Solana supporter. Markets Insider detailed the Bankman-Fried-backed projects on the blockchain and the massive amounts of SOL he accumulated.\n\nSource: The Verge\n\nIt was that contagion that resulted in the altcoin crashing 96% from its November 2021 high in that same report. Thereafter, eliminating tens of billions in market cap from the platform. Now, it has moved forward from that relationship, with a blog post assuring users that less than 1% of its cash or cash equivalents was on FTX.com prior to its demise. Moreover, there was no SOL in the custody of the exchange.\n\nThis assurance to their consumer base, along with quick action, has separated its fate from those of Gemini or Genesis, both boasting their own issues. Furthermore, the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, Tweeted praise for his competitor. Stating that people he trusts have remarked to him about the \u201cearnest smart developer community in Solana.\u201d\n\nSolana\u2019s Bounceback into the New Year\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nFollowing its decimated price, Solana was quick to bounce back, with yesterday alone seeing a 15% increase in SOL. That development marked its sixth-straight session increase since the new year. Moreover, despite the price decline, 2022 relayed on-chain data that displayed continued growth throughout the year.\n\nThe network saw continued new addresses and monthly users all year despite slowed growth in Q4. Now, Solana has seen its daily active user base increase by 50% in January, according to Token Terminal. The question, however, is whether or not the renaissance is for real, or if \u201chopium\u201d is at an all-time high.\n\nSource: Analytics Insight\n\nThe entire cryptocurrency market has seen momentum meet its start to 2023, with spikes in both competitors, Ethereum and Polygon, according to U.Today. Correspondingly, Solana\u2019s growth is attributed to its impressive speed of transactions. Their website states their impressive block time of 400 milliseconds, with room to increase through upgraded networks and hardware. Moreover, the speed equates to a remarkable 2,804 transactions per second.\n\nWhether or not Solana\u2019s 2023 renaissance is sustainable is a question only time can answer. The festive hope of the new year could be propelling Solana, along with the industry, to a temporary height. How things level out remains the truest test."

        "content": "An overview of the current state of the crypto market, with a focus on Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Cardano, Solana, and Cronos.\n\nFollowing the numerous black swans of 2022, many investors have initiated sudden capital shifts, resulting in an even more volatile market for meme coins in particular.\n\nPrice analysis of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Cardano, Solana, and Cronos\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the prices and situation of the most beloved meme coins and then widen our gaze to the more emblazoned Cardano, Solano, and Cronos.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nDOGE (Dogecoin) born now 10 years ago from the energies of Billy Markus and engineer Jackson Palmer, is nothing more than a fork of Litecoin (LTC), itself a fork of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn the plans of the two engineers, the coin was to be a fast and likeable payment method (Meme Coin) with classic payment fees totally absent.\n\nIn addition to taking on these features, the token was used for the social Reddit and Twitter, the latter belonging to the now no longer richest man in the world, Elon Musk.\n\nThe crypto is named after the famous \u201cDoge\u201d meme with the Shiba Inu puppy that is also used as the logo.\n\nWithin the crypto community, it is considered the quintessential meme coin characterized as all those digital coins belonging to this highly volatile group.\n\nToday the value of Dogecoin is \u20ac0.06866754 and registers an increase of 0.55% compared to yesterday while the volume is \u20ac436,392,338.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s price reaches eighth place in the special market capitalization ranking with \u20ac9,439,455.225.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nDogecoin\u2019s twin is Shiba Inu, same little dog to inspire the coin but different logo and name.\n\nIts price to date is \u20ac0.00000766 and is characterized by ever-volatile sessions.\n\nThe crypto was born as a main competitor to Dogecoin and unlike the latter which is based on Scrypt, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is based on Ethereum\u2019s mining algorithm.\n\nIn total there are six dog-inspired meme coins and they complete the \u201cfamily\u201d Baby Dogecoin (BabyDoge), JINDO INU (JIND), Alaska Inu (LAS), and Alaskan Malamute Token (LASM).\n\nAfter losing the Dogecoin train in 2013, other fans and careful investors poured right into SHIB, which as of today has a value of \u20ac0.000008 with a daily trading volume of \u20ac141,750,743.\n\nThe currency dropped 30% in the last day, slipping to the 16th position by market capitalization with \u20ac4,331,305,837 and a circulating volume of SHIB 549,063,278,876,302.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano touched the price $0.27 again with +0.24% today and a recovery of almost 9% in the last week (8.75%).\n\nThe new bundles in the altcoin furnace bring Cardano back above Polkadot and it has been a while since this has occurred.\n\nIf one takes into consideration the ratio of market value to realized value (MVRV) one will notice how it has been rising significantly in the last 5 days which bodes well for a continuation of the digital currency\u2019s bullish trend.\n\nThe EMA (Exponential Moving Average), shows us that the bearish players dominate in the market while the On Balance Volume (OBV) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) bring to light a downward trend in stark contrast to what was said at the beginning.\n\nThe initial theory, however, finds fertile ground in the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) which gives hope to those who feel bullish.\n\nAccording to most analysts in 2023 Cardano might even touch $0.200.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana shares 12.43 euros down 5.01% from the last day after it had risen 37% in the last 7 days.\n\nThe current price is 94.93% away from the all-time high of \u20ac244.95 Euro with a circulating amount of 367,932,019.513 SOL.\n\nSolana is aiming for greater scalability of the blockchain through proof-of-stake and proof of history i.e., a definite record of transactions in chronological order, essentially SOL can support 50,000 transactions per second while remaining decentralized.\n\nCronos (CRO)\n\nThe crypto today touched the price $0.05886 while its daily trading volume is $9.05 Million exhibiting a growth of 2.19% compared to yesterday.\n\nCronos is Crypto.com\u2018s native token and boasts a 24-hour trading volume of \u20ac13,381,608.\n\nIts capitalization makes it among the top 30 Coins stopping at \u20ac1,414,020,299 with 25,263,013,692 CRO in circulation."

        "title": "This Crypto Will Be the Solana of 2023 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Will the Aptos token ever live up to its hype?\n\nOne of the most highly touted cryptos to debut in 2022 was Aptos (APT 1.12%), a Layer 1 blockchain network that some were calling \"the next Ethereum (ETH 0.89%)\" and \"the next Solana (SOL -0.08%)\" right out of the gate. The token came with a world-class developer team, tremendous hype, and hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital financing.\n\nUnfortunately, Aptos arrived in the crypto market on Oct. 19 -- just days before the meltdown of FTX (FTT). Add in the fact that much of its venture financing came from former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, and you can see why traders dropped the token like a hot potato. Aptos made its debut at $9, hit a high of $10.25 within its first week, and then fell as low as $3.07 before the end of the year.\n\nSo what can we expect from Aptos in 2023?\n\nSimilarities between Aptos and Solana\n\nBack in 2021, being called \"the next Solana\" would have been the ultimate compliment for a cryptocurrency. At that time, Solana was one of the hottest cryptos, praised for its fast transaction processing speeds and rapidly growing ecosystem. In a head-to-head comparison with Ethereum -- which was still in the process of preparing to carry out The Merge -- Solana looked like a potential winner. Moreover, Solana came with the imprimatur of approval from Sam Bankman-Fried, who was still enjoying his reputation as a legendary figure in the crypto world.\n\nFast-forward to 2022, however, and the situation was turning upside down. Yes, Solana was still one of the fastest blockchains on the planet, but it was also experiencing increasing periods of network outages, and some were questioning its scalability. Then came the first market meltdown of the year, and suddenly all bets were off. After Ethereum managed to pull off The Merge without any hitches, Solana's prospects dimmed further. And once the FTX meltdown hit in November and investors realized just how much of a role Bankman-Fried had played in getting Solana off the ground, Solana went into free fall -- and no wonder. By the end of the year, Solana was down nearly 95%.\n\nThat's why the similarities between Aptos and Solana are so unsettling for investors. Aptos, too, came to market promising to be the fastest Layer 1 blockchain network. It, too, had the support of Bankman-Fried, who helped Aptos conduct a $150 million Series A venture capital financing round in July 2022. And it came with a world-class developer team that had migrated over from Meta Platforms (META 2.67%). This was the same team that helped build the Diem blockchain project for Meta (then known as Facebook), giving the crypto an impeccable pedigree. The future looked bright for Aptos.\n\nTwo scenarios for Aptos\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, Aptos has the potential to be either the Solana of 2021 or the Solana of 2022. In the first scenario, the price of Aptos could skyrocket as traders dig into the numbers and realize just how much the crypto might be undervalued. Right now, Aptos has a market capitalization of just $490 million -- about a ninth of the size of Solana, which now has a market capitalization of $4.5 billion. If Aptos really is \"the next Solana\" -- shouldn't their market caps be closer in size? There might be significant value here.\n\nOne way Aptos is standing out from its rivals is by focusing on large, enterprise-class customers that want to implement huge blockchain projects. As Aptos notes, its blockchain was \"built with billions in mind.\" It's the same technology used to create a production-class blockchain for Facebook, which has billions of users around the globe. Solana had its share of network outages throughout 2022, so the ability to get access to a fast, scalable, and robust blockchain network from Aptos might be attractive to large corporations.\n\nIn the second scenario, though, the price of Aptos could further decline throughout 2023. Just as Solana sank by 95% in 2022, Aptos could take a rocky, volatile ride downward as crypto investors systematically remove all \"Sam coins\" from their portfolios. Now that Ethereum seems to have fended off the challenge from Solana, can we really expect investors to give much of a chance to Aptos, which has only had a few months to make its mark in the crypto market? Investors might decide that Aptos really is \"the next Solana\" -- and then rush for the exits in their efforts to get out before the crypto falls to zero.\n\nIs Aptos a buy?\n\nIn many ways, Aptos offers a cautionary lesson for traders hoping to get in on \"the next hot crypto.\" Often, reality fails to live up to the hype. Right now, Aptos is too new for me to give it a buy recommendation, and it simply came to the market at the wrong time. Had Aptos debuted in 2021, we might not even be having this discussion. Instead of talking about \"the next Solana,\" we might be talking about \"the next Aptos.\""
