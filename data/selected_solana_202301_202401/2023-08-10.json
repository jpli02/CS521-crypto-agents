        "content": "SOLANA BEACH, Calif. (KGTV) \u2014 The United States Coast Guard says it caught 13 undocumented migrants trying to enter the United States on a small boat in San Diego County on Thursday.\n\nAccording to the agency, they received a report from California State Parks around 10:30 a.m. about a vessel trying to land near Carlsbad.\n\nThe boat was blocked by local police and lifeguards in the area, causing it to continue southbound and make another attempt at landing north of Del Mar at Fletcher Cove, officials said.\n\nFor unknown reasons, the vessel became disabled around 100 yards from the shore, and someone jumped into the water.\n\nThat person was apprehended by lifeguards and turned over to Border Patrol. It is unclear if they were a migrant or a U.S. native.\n\nThe Coast Guard told ABC 10News they launched a small boat to the scene and apprehended 13 people in the vessel. Those individuals were also handed over to Border Patrol, who seized the vessel as well.\n\nLocal police, Solana Beach and State lifeguards, San Clemente Border Patrol, and the Marine Task Force assisted with the incident."

However, the 18-foot boat continued southbound instead and tried to land near Fletcher Cove.\n\nOfficials said the boat became disabled about 100 yards offshore.\n\nOne person jumped into the water.

        "title": "Solana cuts price of its Saga phone by 40% four months after launch - Blockworks",
        "content": "The Android-based Solana Saga has seen a significant price reduction from its iPhone-like starting price of $1,000 down to $599.\n\nSolana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, announced the news via Twitter on Wednesday. The company said the $400 cut is \u201cthe next step to get wider adoption of mobile web3 and continue to improve the experience for the Solana mobile community.\u201d\n\nThe numbers tell a slightly different story.\n\nOn-chain data compiled by Flipside Crypto shows that sales for the Solana Saga have come down massively since their April and May highs.\n\nThe data tracks the number of Saga Genesis NFT mints, something that occurs when the owner of a Solana Saga sets up their phone and the Solana app store.\n\nAs of July 25, there are slightly more than 2,100 unique Saga Genesis NFT owners. This suggests that approximately this many Solana Sagas have been activated since early April.\n\nEmmett Hollyer, the head of business operations for Solana Mobile, told Blockworks that price cuts like this are standard in the industry.\n\n\u201cImplementing a price reduction several months after launch is common practice in the consumer electronics business, particularly with smartphones,\u201d Hollyer said.\n\n\u201cA lower price will accelerate user adoption,\u201d he added.\n\nTwitter users who say they purchased the Solana Saga at the $1,000 price point voiced their frustration with Solana\u2019s decision. Others showed support for the price reduction.\n\nOne user said they regretted buying the phone and said this was a \u201cterrible look.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIn the replies to that tweet, some argued that early adopters often pay a premium. In this case, that would be the people who bought the first 2,000 Solana Sagas.\n\nOther argued that early owners of the phone were able to mint exclusive Claynosaurz NFTs. The floor price for one of these collectibles on Magic Eden is about 33 SOL, which equates to over $800. This more than covers the price differential of $400.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe first rumblings of the Solana Saga occurred way back in June 2022, when the company unveiled their plan to give people an opportunity to manage their crypto and NFT holdings from a mobile device.\n\n\u201cWe live our lives on our mobile devices \u2014 except for Web3 because there hasn\u2019t been a mobile-centric approach to private key management,\u201d Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko told Blockworks at the time.\n\nThe phone launched in April, starting out with 16 decentralized apps on its native app store, including Audius, Dialect, Jupiter Aggregator, Ledger and Magic Eden among others.\n\nUpdated Aug. 10, 2023 at 4:36 pm ET: Added comment from Emmett Hollyer, the head of business operations for Solana Mobile.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
