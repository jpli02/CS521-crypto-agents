        "content": "With its longtime chefs in residence taking over at Little Thief, its wine bar and bistro in North Park, the group behind Vino Carta has installed a new team at its Solana Beach kitchen that will be kicking off an indefinite run in the space on Monday, June 12. Operating there every Monday and Tuesday going forward, Cucina Carnevale is a pop-up pizzeria specializing in Neapolitan-style pies.\n\nFounded by Mikey and Sara Carnevale, it revolves around a portable but mighty Ooni pizza oven that the couple received as a wedding gift. After traveling through Italy and Europe for four months last year, the Carnevales returned to San Diego and rolled out the pop-up at farmer\u2019s markets in Solana Beach and Linda Vista as well as Culture Brewing Company\u2019s tasting room and brewery in the Cedros Design District.\n\nNow fueled by multiple pizza ovens, Cucina Carnevale will be offering several 10-inch pizzas at Vino Carta every week, including pepperoni, margherita, and a rotating special. Featuring on June 12 and 13 is the Vino Veggie, a tomato-sauced pie topped with mozzarella, red onion, black olives, green bell pepper, and mushrooms. The Carnevales source all their ingredients from California and making everything by hand, including the dough which undergoes a 48-hour fermentation for optimal flavor and texture.\n\nCucina Carnevale takes over the Monday and Tuesday night schedule from Mesa Agricola, which is currently cooking in North Park and scheduled to return to Solana Beach on August 2 where it\u2019ll serve its farm-to-table menu Wednesday through Sunday. Mesa Agricola will be replacing Long Story Short, which is finishing up the summer in Solana Beach and then moving permanently into Little Thief.\n\nSign up for the newsletter Eater San Diego Sign up for our newsletter.

        "content": "Firedancer delivered good results in initial performance tests, hitting 1 million TPS.\n\nSOL dropped 10% since SEC\u2019s claim that the altcoin was security.\n\nScalability is one of the most significant barriers to blockchain progress in current times. Networks are continuously looking for new, innovative ways to improve transaction throughput so as to gain an upper hand in the competitive environment.\n\nWhile most entities opt for the modular approach i.e, splitting the functions across sidechains and layer-2 chains (L2), the Solana [SOL] network opted for a monolithic way of improving scalability at layer-1 itself, according to on-chain analytics firm Messari.\n\nThe initiative to develop Firedancer, Solana\u2019s second validator client, represents an important step in this direction.\n\n1/ Scalability is a key factor in the crypto space, with the modular approach gaining popularity. However, @Solana has taken a contrarian stance.@kelxyz_ explains how @jump_firedancer, a validator client developed by @jump_ aims to enhance Solana's monolithic approach.? pic.twitter.com/zRc3Q5wSeT \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) June 6, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Solana Profit Calculator\n\nSolana on \u2018Fire\u2019\n\nSolana got into a partnership with Web3 infrastructure developer Jump Crypto in August 2022. This was to create a new validator client Firedancer, separate from the one originally built by Solana Labs. With the ambition of boosting network throughput, the project delivered good results in initial performance tests, hitting 1 million transactions per second (TPS).\n\nAmong other potential benefits of Firedancer, the first and foremost was reducing Solana\u2019s latency times significantly. This made the network conducive for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and attracting high-frequency traders. Messari stated that Solana\u2019s latency times might be reduced to 400-500 milliseconds, putting it on par with centralized exchanges (CEXs).\n\nMessari\u2019s research highlighted that if it clicks the right boxes, Firedancer had the potential to open up unexplored market space and create new demand for the Solana chain. For example, if it manages to clock 1 million TPS, Solana could attract Web2 applications like social media and financial platforms.\n\nAt the time of writing though, the \u2018Ethereum killer\u2019 processed an average of 4,000 TPS over the last seven days, per data from Solscan. The total transaction fees paid to validators to secure the network was 39.256 in the last 24 hours.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nSOL suffers but\u2026\n\nSOL was yet to recover from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s latest blow labeling the ninth-largest crypto asset in the market as a security. At press time, it exchanged hands at $19.85, having dropped 10% since SEC\u2019s claim, according to Santiment.\n\nSurprisingly, market sentiment for the coin turned favorable as a result of this development, going into the positive zone after a week of trading."

        "content": "A widely-followed analyst is giving a bullish outlook on the blockchain development of the Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL).\n\nIn a new interview with Paul Barron, the pseudonymous host of InvestAnswers says that the Solana ecosystem is undergoing impressive upgrades.\n\n\u201cWhat amazed me about Solana early on \u2013 we\u2019re talking 25, 26 months ago \u2013 was I was looking for an ETH killer to protect my ETH position. If there was something coming for it, I needed to be on it. But the type of developments that they have done over those last 26 months \u2013 mind-blowing, absolutely crazy.\u201d\n\nHe says the improvements to the blockchain project like Jump Crypto\u2019s open-source validator client Firedancer will boost scalability and network processing times.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s really intriguing to me is this, is how they\u2019re going to scale as they go forward with Firedancer and they have a thing called side-scaling and this basically will change exactly how they go forward. Firedancer is a Solana validator developed by Jump Crypto and it aims to significantly enhance Solana scalability and most importantly, what people don\u2019t focus on, is reduce latency times down to essentially milliseconds. This will pose a huge threat to many other things\u2026\n\nThis came from [crypto analytics firm] Messari actually. They talk about how Firedancer puts Solana in the range of CEX (centralized exchange) latency times, i.e. the ability to run a New York Stock Exchange or a NASDAQ or multiple exchanges. And they go on and talk about things like security and expenses and processing times and, again, latency, which is so important.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, the upgrades going on in the ecosystem set it apart from many of the other blockchain projects and it will lead to more development and use cases.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the things that I think are just mind-blowing about Solana that many people kind of don\u2019t understand. They lump it in the same category with other layer-1s, layer-2s, but it is so far ahead because of some of those things that I mentioned and it all comes down to scale. How can you onboard a billion people The answer is with a truckload of scale. And how do you have a breadth of use cases, the answer is zero latency and a ton of throughput.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $18.73 at time of writing, down 8% during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Why the US is waging war on Binance, Coinbase - Forkast News",
        "content": "In this issue\n\nBinance/Coinbase: Massive attack Solana NFTs: Bested by Bitcoin Hong Kong crypto: Regulatory rollout\n\nFrom the Editor\u2019s Desk Dear Reader, The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has pulled the trigger on some of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world \u2014 and potentially all of them. By categorizing those cryptocurrencies as securities, it has the crypto industry in its clutches and facing a drawn-out legal battle. It now appears that the regulator\u2019s beef with Ripple and XRP was just the beginning. The SEC is now able to put to use the legal lessons it has learned in that years-long case against the tokens it has named in its complaint against Binance: BNB, BUSD, SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL and ALGO, and implicitly more. The term \u201cripple effect\u201d has acquired an unpalatable new meaning in crypto circles. The SEC\u2019s action on June 5 will go down as the crypto industry\u2019s \u201cBlack Monday.\u201d The regulator\u2019s carpet bombing-style legal offensive wiped out US$320 million within 24 hours as crypto liquidations accelerated. The real impact is only beginning to be felt, but the implications are enormous. Among other questions: What is a utility token? What is a security? Why is Ethereum considered a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when Polygon, a layer-2 chain that scales Ethereum, is considered a security and now potentially finds itself in the SEC\u2019s crosshairs? Is the mere fact that cryptocurrencies are sold and traded sufficient grounds for them to be considered securities and thus subjected to SEC regulation? (The Howey Test, established in 1946 and used as a means to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract, gives the SEC plenty of room for maneuver.) More SEC actions are likely in the works. While it appears that the SEC is going after the industry, the ultimate victims may be Americans themselves. The \u201cmoat\u201d that excludes Americans from services offered in most of the rest of the world and from the innovations offered by digital currencies is only getting deeper and wider. The legal liability and exposure that come with servicing even one U.S. citizen immediately render projects vulnerable to the SEC\u2019s legal dragnet. No one will want to serve Americans. The very regulations that purport to protect investors will essentially rob them of access to digital assets. Meanwhile, I\u2019m in Hong Kong this week, half a world away, a city whose securities regulator has just launched new virtual asset service provider regulations. And for the retail market, it has released virtual asset trading platform rules, outlining a process that onboards crypto to trading platforms for accredited and non-accredited investors alike. Amid the SEC\u2019s onslaught, such developments are leaving Americans in the dust. Freedom indeed. Starve the industry of customers and reduce liquidity, and watch demand and business opportunities dry up in the U.S. Elsewhere, the market continues to thrive in new ways, only with diminished American input \u2014 and vice versa. You can be sure that as U.S. customers find themselves cut off from off-ramping crypto to dollars, others around the world will be picking up bargains today as crypto activity elsewhere ramps up. The SEC has trained its sights on the crypto industry, but may have shot itself \u2014 and the country it\u2019s supposed to serve \u2014 in the foot, hobbling America\u2019s influence over the future of finance. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast\n\n1. Regulatory reckoning\n\nBinance has a colorful history when it comes to interactions with regulators, but its latest tangle with the SEC will likely dwarf its previous troubles. Image: SEC/Canva\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed 13 charges against crypto exchange Binance, Binance Chief Executive Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, and BAM Trading Services \u2014 the Binance affiliate that operates Binance.US \u2014 on Monday, alleging multiple violations of securities laws. The following day, the regulator filed a lawsuit alleging similar violations against Coinbase.\n\nIn the 136-page complaint the SEC filed to the District Court for the District of Columbia, the regulator alleged that despite Binance and Zhang having publicly claimed that U.S. users would be blocked from the platform, the exchange \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 had been secretly providing services to high-value U.S. customers and had committed multiple other violations.\n\n\u201cThrough thirteen charges, we allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law,\u201d SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe regulator charged Binance and BAM Trading with operating as unregistered securities exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies and with engaging in unregistered offers and sales of securities involving a dozen cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe tokens the SEC listed as \u201ccrypto asset securities\u201d in its complaint include Binance\u2019s BNB token, stablecoin BUSD, Solana, Cardano\u2019s ADA and Polygon\u2019s MATIC. Taking into account the other tokens already targeted by the SEC, the value of the coins regarded as securities by the SEC amounts to US$115 billion, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nBinance and its CEO were also charged with commingling or diverting customers\u2019 assets as they pleased, an allegation that also appeared in connection with the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.\n\nThe SEC alleged that the defendants commingled billions of U.S. dollars of investors\u2019 assets and sent them to the bank account of an entity called Merit Peak Limited, which is also owned by Zhao. The regulator alleged that the funds were then transferred to a third party, apparently in connection with the purchase and sale of crypto assets.\n\nWash trading also appears in the list of charges. The SEC complaint alleged that Sigma Chain \u2014 a crypto trading company allegedly owned and controlled by Zhao \u2014 had \u201cartificially inflated\u201d trading volumes on the Binance.US platform from at least September 2019 until June 2022.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint seeks to permanently prevent Binance, Binance.US and Zhao from further violating U.S. federal laws, to compel them to disgorge \u201cill-gotten gains\u201d with interest, to permanently prevent them from engaging in unregistered crypto transactions and crypto exchange and brokerage activities, to impose civil financial penalties, and to compensate investors.\n\nIn response to the SEC\u2019s lawsuit, Binance said in a statement that it had been cooperating with the SEC to \u201creach a negotiated settlement to resolve their investigations.\u201d Binance said: \u201cThe SEC\u2019s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the commission\u2019s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry.\u201d\n\nA Binance spokesperson told Forkast in an emailed statement that BNB and BUSD stablecoin were not securities. \u201cRather, BNB is a native token, designed to create an internal economy; thus, its value derives from its participants,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s latest crypto lawsuit comes as another blow to Binance, not long after a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in March over alleged violations of derivatives rules. Binance claims that it does not service customers in the U.S., having set up Binance.US as a separate company and platform for U.S. residents.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB coin, the 4th largest crypto by market cap, tumbled another 5.8% to US$261.31 in the 24 hours to press time, which is also its three-month low, according to CoinGecko data. But BNB is a relatively minor casualty in a development that has sent shockwaves through the crypto sector. While Bitcoin declined by 2.1% and Ether by 2.4% in the past 24 hours, Cardano dropped by 6.2% and Solana plunged 8.3%.\n\n\u201cThe industry will be very different in a year,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, told Forkast in an emailed note. \u201cTrading volumes will likely drop further and pressure market makers\u2019 revenue projections. Crypto in the U.S. will continue to go through a nuclear winter. The only viable option for crypto firms might be Hong Kong, where the regulator appears willing to offer a licensed level playing field.\u201d Thielen also cited Hong Kong\u2019s multibillion-dollar family office investors who are keen to fund crypto entrepreneurs and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area for access to talent as reasons why the city will seem even more attractive to Web3 startups.\n\nThe SEC continued its onslaught on Tuesday, filing a lawsuit against Coinbase in which it charged the company with operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency, and with engaging in unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities.\n\nThe SEC has been slammed by many in the digital asset industry for its enforcement actions and lawsuits against crypto exchanges. The regulator fined U.S. crypto exchange Kraken and shut its crypto staking program in February, and charged Seattle-based crypto platform Bittrex with operating an unregistered exchange in April.\n\nIn response to the SEC\u2019s series of enforcement actions, Coinbase sued the commission in April, seeking clarity on crypto regulation.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Binance may have finally run out of road in the U.S. And it looks as though Coinbase might be in a similar predicament. Binance is now fighting cases against both the CFTC and the SEC. Coinbase, which has also had a fraught relationship with the SEC, is now also being sued for securities violations. That means both exchanges will be formally frozen out of the world\u2019s biggest single market for cryptocurrency while legal proceedings are under way \u2014 that is, if they don\u2019t collapse first. Fund outflows from Binance have accelerated over the past few days, with more than US$300 million leaving the exchange in one 24-hour period this week. The news, somewhat unsurprisingly, led to a slump in the broader crypto market, for two reasons. First, because both Binance and Coinbase have played an outsized role in crypto\u2019s fortunes. Binance captured two-thirds of the Bitcoin spot trading market, and its BNB token helped it to overtake Ethereum by the number of active addresses. Coinbase had a similar hold on the U.S. market. But perhaps the bigger, more concerning news for the market at large, is that the SEC is not just targeting crypto exchanges. In the regulator\u2019s filing, Binance\u2019s BNB, Binance stablecoin BUSD, Cardano\u2019s ADA, Solana\u2019s SOL, Polygon\u2019s MATIC, Filecoin\u2019s FIL and Algorand\u2019s ALGO were all listed as unregistered securities. That means other exchanges are now having to consider delisting some of the biggest projects by market cap to avoid regulatory risks. The currencies named in the suit are all nursing significant losses as a result. The ongoing regulatory crackdown on crypto exchanges in the U.S., alongside the collapse of crypto-friendly banks earlier in the year, has significantly narrowed the on- and off-ramps for crypto investors. And although authorities in Asia and elsewhere have warmed to the industry, repairing the damage left by the U.S. government\u2019s calamitous handling of crypto will likely take years.\n\n2. Solana eclipse\n\nThe release of the Ordinals protocol, which made Bitcoin NFTs a reality, has come at considerable cost to Solana\u2019s NFT trading volume. Image: Solana/Canva\n\nSolana\u2019s secondary non-fungible token (NFT) sales dropped nearly 50% in May, from US$85.7 million to US$44.9 million in April. The Forkast SOL NFT Composite, an index of NFT activity on the Solana blockchain, fell 12.13% during May.\n\n\u201cThe single reason for the major change in the Solana ecosystem is simply the impact of Bitcoin NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, an NFT strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cSince Bitcoin NFTs launched at the end of January, you can see Solana\u2019s numbers steadily decreasing. Sellers, buyers [and] total transactions are all 50% or less than they were prior to Bitcoin NFTs.\u201d\n\nBitcoin NFTs became a reality after the January introduction of the Ordinals protocol, which allows data such as text and images to be inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s monthly NFT sales skyrocketed 474% in May, topping US$189 million, according to CryptoSlam, the data analytics arm of Forkast Labs. That boost made the Bitcoin network the world\u2019s second-most-popular NFT chain, knocking Solana off a perch it had frequently occupied.\n\n\u201cPeople who use Solana are likely already Bitcoin users, but it doesn\u2019t work the other way around,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cI would assume that many who use Bitcoin don\u2019t touch chains other than Ethereum. The point here is that the Bitcoin blockchain appeals to every single crypto and NFT trader, and the same can\u2019t be said of Solana.\u201d\n\nA recent surge in the popularity of memecoins has also been a factor in Solana\u2019s falling NFT sales, according to Brian Boisjoli, a product manager at Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cThe majority of people were trading memecoins instead of NFTs,\u201d said Boisjoli, who has traded memecoins rather than NFTs amid the former\u2019s recent popularity. \u201cIt suggests people are going to chase the hot item and leave the last shiny [NFT] in the dust.\u201d\n\nThe hype around Ordinals has propelled Bitcoin into a position to challenge Ethereum in the NFT space. Bitcoin\u2019s May NFT sales of US$195.7 million stood at nearly half of Ethereum\u2019s monthly total of US$356.8 million, the highest figure among all blockchains, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s monthly NFT sales surged 71.70% in the 24 hours to press time, but NFT sales on Ethereum dropped 10.82% over the same period, and the Forkast ETH NFT Composite fell 3.71%.\n\n\u201cPeople should really pay attention to how significant, and how disruptive, Bitcoin NFTs are, especially if you are of the mind that Bitcoin NFTs volume could eclipse Ethereum\u2019s in the future,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cAt that point, will there be any demand for blockchains other than Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ethereum\u2019s layer-2s?\u201d Petscher added that Bitcoin would likely continue to capture market share from other blockchains, reshaping the NFT landscape.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Innovation and investment in Web3 have over the past five years trended toward bigger, faster chains and the companies built on them. But an exploit in Bitcoin\u2019s code and the introduction of a token standard by an anonymous Twitter user has meant that the oldest, slowest and most cumbersome chain in terms of utility has eroded many other chains\u2019 unique selling points in the NFT space. That\u2019s because during market slumps, investors\u2019 money tends to flow into Bitcoin and out of newer, more innovative chains. Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance has crept up from a low of 39% in September 2022 to 48% today. While historically that\u2019s been due to the perception that Bitcoin is a useful store of value during market downturns, more recently, BTC\u2019s growing dominance has been down to its ability to attract capital through inscriptions. Bitcoin now boasts a US$600 million token economy spread across 24,000 tokens on its network, in addition to a thriving NFT marketplace. Although that\u2019s rather smaller than Ethereum, Bitcoin achieved that impressive number in a few months, while chains such as Solana have taken years. The ball is now back in the court of Solana and other ecosystems. Low fees and high speeds may have attracted developers to these networks, but they\u2019ll need another big leap forward to tempt investors and developers to jump ship from Bitcoin again.\n\n3. Golden East\n\nObservers say Hong Kong\u2019s new crypto regulatory framework could provide a model for the development of rules for the industry in other jurisdictions.

According to Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs at Hong Kong-based crypto exchange OSL, the city\u2019s move potentially sets an example for other jurisdictions in its new embrace of retail crypto trading.\n\nUnder its new licensing regime, Hong Kong will now allow licensed cryptocurrency trading platforms to offer services to retail investors and implement measures to protect individual traders, aiming to ensure suitability in onboarding processes, good governance, enhanced token due diligence, and clear admission criteria and disclosures.\n\n\u201cNow, all the protections that Hong Kong has built \u2014 client asset protection, capital requirements, insurance requirements, and cyber security controls \u2014 are going to be available to retail investors,\u201d Tiu told Forkast in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good day for retail investors.\u201d Hong Kong previously allowed only institutional and high-net-worth investors to trade crypto.\n\nFounded in 2018, OSL is one of only two digital asset trading platforms in Hong Kong that is licensed to offer services to professional investors. It has applied to the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission to upgrade its license to include retail cryptocurrency trading.\n\nAs Hong Kong officially opens up crypto trading for the masses, companies in the space that are seeking to expand there should expect strict regulation, Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue said last month.\n\n\u201c[Anti-money laundering] controls applying to the regulated digital asset industry are pretty much going to be the norm going forward,\u201d Tiu said. \u201cBut what sets Hong Kong apart is also the fact that, on top of AML, the Hong Kong regime will apply capital requirements, client asset segregation requirements [and other investor protections]. So, we have an equal playing field in the Hong Kong market. That\u2019s certainly a good thing for Hong Kong and for investors. I think it will also be a very important reference point for other markets to study as well.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s desire to allow retail crypto trading contrasts with the stance taken by rival Asian finance hub Singapore, which discourages speculative crypto trading, especially among retail investors. Thailand has banned crypto lending and staking services, and India has imposed steep taxes to discourage retail investors from crypto trading.\n\nHong Kong could function as a sandbox for mainland China, which had imposed an all-out crypto ban in 2021, to test digital asset regulation. Late last month, China\u2019s main national TV network reported on the city\u2019s crypto regulations, and Beijing\u2019s metropolitan government issued a Web 3.0 white paper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like what we did with Shenzhen in the Chinese economic reform in the 1980s,\u201d Deng Jian-peng, a fintech law expert and law professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, told Forkast in an interview, referring to the development of the southern Chinese town as China\u2019s first special economic zone. \u201cWe can evaluate the risks in crypto assets through the experiments in Hong Kong and then decide whether \u2014 or how to \u2014 adjust crypto regulation on the mainland.\u201d"
