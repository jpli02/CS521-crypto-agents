        "title": "Ironforge nabs $2.6M to build platform to make Solana development easier than ever - Refresh Miami",
        "content": "By Riley Kaminer\n\nSolana played a protagonistic role in last week\u2019s $1 trillion crypto crash after regulators spooked digital asset investors by charging major exchanges Coinbase and Binance with a smattering of violations.\n\nThe SEC also classified Solana \u2013 alongside fellow cryptocurrencies Cardano and Polygon \u2013 as unregistered securities. That led Robinhood to stop supporting these currencies and Crypto.com to halt services for US-based institutional traders.\n\nIt was a veritable \u201cbloodbath,\u201d asserted trader Lark Davis. \u201cSEC protecting investors again!\u201d he quipped.\n\nBut amid this dire situation, the blockchain continues to grow and a ray of hope came this week, from Miami no less.\n\nServerless Solana development platform Ironforge yesterday announced that it has raised a $2.6 million pre-seed round led by Reciprocal Ventures. Other investors include Miami-based Hash3, 6th Man Ventures, Alchemy, Monoceros Ventures and Portage Ventures. These funds will enable Ironforge to build their platform and expand their team.\n\nThe startup, which also released its product in a private beta yesterday, aims to make it easier for developers to integrate the blockchain powering Solana into existing systems. The idea is that the novel nature of Solana makes developing on its blockchain tricky. Ironforge reduces this complexity by simplifying app integrations and giving developers shortcuts to popular features.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the longstanding conviction that blockchain\u2019s potential won\u2019t be unlocked until web3 devs have access to frameworks and tooling that are similar to what we\u2019ve grown accustomed to in web2,\u201d Ironforge CEO Italo Casas said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe created Ironforge to ensure developers need to do as little undifferentiated work as possible, devoting as much of their time and energy towards the thing that makes their product unique.\u201d\n\nCasas founded Ironforge in August 2022. Previously, he founded MetaSoftware Labs and was a senior software engineer at Lavu, Bankrate, and FlexShopper \u2013 on top of being on the Node.js core team.\n\nDespite the recent drop in Solana as a cryptocurrency, the ecosystem surrounding is growing. As of the end of May, the chain saw over 12.67 million active addresses, representing 64.1% month-on-month growth. Additionally, Solana has recorded consistent month over month growth in active addresses on the network in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Ironforge platform has the potential to become the global standard for creating applications on Solana,\u201d asserted Craig Burel, partner at Reciprocal Ventures. \u201cBy providing a seamless and delightful developer experience, we expect Ironforge will accelerate the utilization of web3 across the broader developer ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIronforge lowers the barrier to configure, deploy and maintain production grade programs on Solana, accelerating innovation cycles and enabling developers to spend more time on feature development,\u201d added Carl Vogel from 6th Man Ventures. \u201cWe are thrilled to back Ironforge as they make Web3 development as seamless as Web2.\u201d\n\nInterested in checking out Ironforge\u2019s platform?

        "content": "In the crypto and blockchain space, Sui refers to the Sui network or its native token of the same name. Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain with a mainnet launch on May 3, 2023. The native token launches on a variety of crypto exchanges including Bybit and Kucoin as of that day.\n\nEven before the mainnet launch, however, Sui attracted attention from many in the crypto community. Below, we take a closer look at what Sui is and why it is notable in the ever-growing field of blockchains and crypto tokens.\n\nWhat is the Sui Network?\n\nThe Sui blockchain is Layer 1, meaning it provides the underlying infrastructure for a system of validations and transactions in much the same way as the foundational Bitcoin or Ethereum networks. Layer 1 blockchains are the fundamental architecture which support a token\u2014or, in some cases, a broader network of different tokens.\n\nSui sets itself apart from other Layer 1 chains with its focus on instant transaction finality, reduced latency in smart contract deployment, and overall transaction speed.

Sui does not require global consensus on an ordered list of transactions, which is a key bottleneck area for many existing blockchains.\n\nSui's validation system sets itself apart by providing parallel processing of transactions\n\nSui was developed by Mysten Labs, led by several former senior executives and architects for Meta\u2019s now-defunct digital wallet program, Novi. It utilizes a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, with a new set of token holders picking validators for token staking every 24-hour period. Staked tokens are locked during each of these periods, or epochs, but can be pulled or changed to a new delegated validator at the time the epoch changes.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrior to its mainnet launch, Sui\u2019s developers announced a successful $300 million Series B funding round in support of development.\n\nWhat is the SUI Token?\n\nSui\u2019s native token, known as SUI, will facilitate the network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, on-chain voting for upgrades to the blockchain, and gas fees. It will also allow Sui users to participate in the system\u2019s DeFi activities.\n\nThe May 3 launch of the Sui mainnet is accompanied by a SUI token sale, with each participating crypto exchange offering 225 million tokens. Each user is eligible for up to 10,000 SUI tokens at a price of $0.10 each. For the time being, U.S. residents are not eligible to participate in the sale.\n\nSui tokens will be distributed both to a community reserve for research and development, grants, and subsidies, and to early contributors to the project, app testers, and other stakeholders. There is a hard cap of 10 billion SUI tokens in total. 14% of tokens released at launch are available for investors.\n\nWhy is Sui in the News?\n\nShortly before Sui\u2019s launch in May 2023, the Binance exchange announced it would make SUI available through Launchpool, a system for users to contribute crypto assets to a liquidity pool to earn rewards. This announcement brought increased attention to Sui, including by Tron founder Justin Sun. Sun deposited a substantial volume of $56 million in TrueUSD stablecoins into Binance, likely for the purpose of farming SUI tokens. This transaction was picked up by the platform Whale Alert, designed to track significant crypto asset transfers.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, responded to Sun\u2019s move by tweeting that the Launchpool was designed for retail users, not just whales. He warned that Binance would take action against Sun if he attempted a SUI token grab. Sun replied that the deposit aimed to facilitate market-making between exchanges, not to participate in any promotion.\n\nLater, Sun said that he had arranged a full refund of the Binance transfer. Binance said it would reallocate the corresponding 279,000 or so farmed SUI tokens to its TUSD liquidity pool."

        "title": "Solana survived Sam Bankman-Fried. Can it survive Gary Gensler? - Fortune",
        "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried, the now disgraced founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, loved Solana. Launched in 2020 by cofounders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, the high-speed blockchain promised to be an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nIt \u201chas a shot at becoming one of the core layers on which most financial and informational transfers happen between applications in a natively Web3 world,\u201d Bankman-Fried once told Fortune.\n\nThe FTX founder, who\u2019s now facing criminal charges for fraud, lauded Solana so much that Alameda Research, his crypto hedge fund, had more than $1 billion in Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency on its balance sheet right before it and FTX suddenly collapsed in November.\n\nIn the days after Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire crumbled, the total market capitalization of SOL, Solana\u2019s token, plummeted\u2014from above $13 billion to about $5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. But it quickly rebounded, and Gokal, the Solana cofounder, told Fortune in May that the FTX meltdown was \u201cin the rearview mirror\u201d as SOL\u2019s market cap rose back to about $8 billion.\n\nNow, Solana is facing a new threat. On Monday and Tuesday of last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission claimed that SOL and at least 12 other tokens are unregistered securities in lawsuits against Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Coinbase, the U.S.\u2019s largest. After the lawsuits were filed, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the crypto industry was populated with \u201chucksters, fraudsters, scam artists,\u201d and \u201cPonzi schemes.\u201d\n\nSince then, the price of SOL dropped from about $22 to $15\u2014nearly 30% as of Monday evening. Its market cap, the second largest among tokens deemed securities by the SEC, has dropped from near $8.5 billion to about $6 billion. And Robinhood, a stock-trading app that also lets users buy and sell cryptocurrencies, said it will delist SOL from its platform come the end of June.\n\nSolana weathered the fall of Bankman-Fried, but despite developers\u2019 continued belief in the blockchain, the pall of future litigation hangs over the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a black mark on their forehead,\u201d Arthur Jakoby, a former SEC prosecutor who now cochairs the securities litigation and enforcement team at Herrick, Feinstein LLP, told Fortune. And, he added, it\u2019s \u201cpotentially an existential threat\u201d for the Solana ecosystem.\n\nIs SOL a security?\n\nThe core of the SEC\u2019s lawsuits boils down to the following: U.S. securities exchanges need to register with the SEC, and because Binance and Coinbase failed to register, they broke the law.\n\nTo make its case, the agency needs to first prove that both companies effectively operated as securities exchanges, which is why it\u2019s arguing in both lawsuits that SOL and more than 12 other tokens, including Polygon\u2019s MATIC and Cardano\u2019s ADA, are unregistered securities. Both exchanges listed SOL.\n\nThe Solana Foundation, the legal entity that Yakovenko and Gokal launched to promote the cryptocurrency, strenuously disagrees with the SEC. After remaining quiet for days after both suits were filed, it responded to the SEC\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Solana Foundation strongly believes that SOL is not a security,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement to Fortune. \u201cWe welcome the continued engagement of policymakers as constructive partners on regulation to achieve legal clarity on these issues for the thousands of entrepreneurs across the U.S. building in the digital assets space.\u201d\n\nThe Solana Foundation disagrees with the characterization of SOL as a security. We welcome the continued engagement of policymakers as constructive partners on regulation to achieve legal clarity on these issues for the thousands of entrepreneurs across the U.S. building in the\u2026 \u2014 Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) June 10, 2023\n\nThe SEC\u2019s allegations have not translated to a direct legal threat for Solana since the agency has only sued Binance and Coinbase, not the Solana Foundation, its founders, or its promoters. Legal experts, however, say that the risk for Solana and other singled-out cryptocurrencies is unequivocally heightened.\n\n\u201cI would be very surprised if we didn\u2019t see some actions in the near future against individual companies and/or their founders,\u201d David Rosenfeld, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University and former SEC prosecutor, wrote in an email to Fortune. \u201cCrypto is a big priority for the SEC right now.\u201d\n\nRosenfeld said that it\u2019s impossible to predict what litigation the agency will bring, but he suspects that the SEC chose the tokens it can best prove are securities. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the SEC will be pursuing these companies individually, but it does indicate that the agency thinks the case against them would be compelling,\u201d he noted.\n\nSpecifically, he mentioned that Solana Labs, another entity created by Yakovenko and Gokal, filed multiple reports with the agency from 2018 through 2020 to argue that SOL was exempt from registration, which, Rosenfeld told Fortune, \u201cis something that could be seen as a concession that they are securities.\u201d\n\nSolana Labs did not release tokens publicly, as a deluge of companies did during the ICO craze of 2016, but rather sold them to venture capitalists to raise funds. It drummed up almost $340 million from private sales, according to the SEC\u2019s Binance and Coinbase complaints. These private sales of SOL are a potential legal escape clause, as Bloomberg\u2019s Matt Levine described them last week.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the underlying technology and what SOL does\u2026I think it\u2019s a utility. It is not a security at all,\u201d a cofounder of a prominent blockchain company, who declined to be named, told Fortune.\n\nHowever, he added: \u201cIn terms of how it was promoted, I think the Solana Foundation and FTX treated it just like it was a security.\u201d\n\nYesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in securities and cryptocurrency regulation, similarly told Fortune that the case against Solana isn\u2019t simple. \u201cThere are some definite complexities here,\u201d she said, pointing out, for example, how developers pay with SOL to use the blockchain\u2019s computing power.\n\nMoreover, while the SEC has recently expanded its recent crypto litigation strategy to target exchanges, that doesn\u2019t mean it will abandon enforcement actions against individual tokens, Jakoby, the former SEC prosecutor at Herrick, told Fortune. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine,\u201d Yadav added, \u201cthat if the SEC is serious about this, they\u2019re not going to potentially bring a case against some of the very prominent coins that are listed.\u201d\n\n\u2018Continue to build\u2019\n\nWhile legal experts emphasized the potentially existential risks of the lawsuits for the singled-out cryptocurrencies, many Solana community members were comparatively optimistic.\n\nThe day after the SEC sued Coinbase, they flocked to New York City for one of Solana\u2019s Hacker Houses, a frequent event the foundation hosts for developers, artists, and investors.\n\nSolana\u2019s NYC Hacker House ran from June 7 to June 11. Ben Weiss\u2014Fortune\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bFor us and for the devs that we know, none of us are lawyers, so we\u2019re still going to continue to build on cool tech,\u201d the founder of payments app Sphere, which builds on Solana and other blockchains, told Fortune. (He declined to give his full name, citing the regulatory uncertainty.)\n\nAidan Neil, cofounder of Ladder Labs, which has built a Solana-based video game as well as a referral system, had a similarly blas\u00e9 reaction once the lawsuits became public. \u201cWe didn\u2019t budge for a second,\u201d he told Fortune at the Hacker House. \u201cTruthfully, we\u2019ve been through so much that it was like, \u2018Oh, great, here we go again.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd venture capitalists were also undeterred. \u201cI guess we are gratified to see Solana again on the national stage,\u201d an investor in Solana, who declined to give his full name given regulatory concerns, told Fortune. \u201cSolana was an extraordinarily compliant fundraise from the beginning.\u201d\n\nBut despite investor and developer insistence on the lawsuits\u2019 non-impact, potential discord from the litigation has breached the Solana community. Days after the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase, some broached the idea of \u201cforking,\u201d or irrevocably updating, Solana to erase the tokens that FTX and Alameda continue to have on its balance sheet. No plans for a fork are imminent.\n\nDo not fork Solana\n\n\n\n1) The SOL belongs to creditors, not FTX\n\n\n\n2) Shared state is the product of social consensus, which is incredibly valuable and the product of agreement from millions of users. Incredibly powerful. Break it at your own risk\n\n\n\n3) Dangerous precedent \u2014 Keone (@keoneHD) June 11, 2023\n\nAt the NYC Hacker House, talk of whether SOL was or wasn\u2019t a security was noticeably absent\u2014until Amira Valliani, the Solana Foundation\u2019s head of policy, broke the silence during a panel titled \u201cWTF is going on in crypto policy.\u201d\n\nNearly 10 minutes into a discussion on the broader crypto regulatory context in Washington, D.C., Valliani, under the purple lights of a popular NYC concert venue, decided to \u201caddress the elephant in the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cSOL is not a security,\u201d she said. There was a smattering of applause among the crowd of developers, artists, and investors. Discussion quickly returned to the state of potential crypto legislation in Congress. Once the approximately 30-minute panel ended, Valliani asked the panelists to offer parting words to the audience.\n\n\u201cKeep building,\u201d said one. Said another: \u201cDon\u2019t panic.\u201d"
