        "content": "Leaders from the cities of Solana Beach and Encinitas will Thursday shore up their beaches for the next half-century by signing a project partnership agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThe agreement will begin placement of beach-dredged sand this fall as the first phase of a 50-year coastal resiliency project that has been in development since 2000, known as the USACE Coastal Storm Damage Reduction Project.\n\nThe project includes the construction of protective beach berms along two segments within both Encinitas and Solana Beach. Sand will be brought in from offshore via a dredge and pumped onto the beach in a slurry.\n\nAccording to project documents, the first includes the construction of a 50-foot-wide protective beach berm extending along 7,800 feet of shoreline in Encinitas, between north of Swami's Beach to south of Beacon's Beach, using 340,000 cubic yards of sediment.\n\nRe-nourishment of this segment will occur on average every five years, with around 220,000 cubic yards of sediment over a 50-year period of federal participation, for a total of nine additional times.\n\n\"This project to put sand on our beaches in Encinitas has been a long time coming,\" said Encinitas Mayor Tony Kranz. \"Visitors and residents who enjoy our Pacific Ocean shoreline will appreciate the decades of work that was done to make it happen.\"\n\nThe second segment is within Solana Beach, and proposes the construction of a 150-foot-wide beach berm extending along a 7,200-foot stretch of shoreline using around 700,000 cubic yards of sediment.\n\nRe-nourishment will occur on average every 10 years, with around 290,000 cubic yards of sediment, over a 50-year period of federal participation, for a total of four additional nourishments. Segment 2 contains the majority of the beach within the city limits of Solana Beach \u2014 Fletcher Cove south to just north of the Del Mar city limits.\n\nThe federal funding for the project was secured by Rep. Mike Levin, D- Dana Point. A signing ceremony is scheduled to commemorate the milestone as this project is touted as being the first of its kind in Southern California in more than 50 years."

        "content": "Beach sand replenishment at Fletcher Cove in 2018. Courtesy SANDAG\n\nLong-term sand replenishment projects will begin in North County and San Clemente after federal officials set aside nearly $40 million to fund them.\n\nThe Encinitas-Solana Beach Coastal Storm Damage Reduction Project involves placing 700,000 cubic yards of sand along 7,200 feet of beach in Solana Beach and 340,000 cubic yards of sand along 7,800 feet of beach in Encinitas.\n\nThe project also will widen the beaches in an attempt to reduce storm damage, improve safety and expand recreational benefits for the public.\n\nRep. Mike Levin, whose Congressional District is split between coastal North County and parts of Orange County, successfully secured $30.5 million for the Encinitas-Solana Beach project through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nLevin had previously sought $1.5 million in funding to complete the planning, engineering and design phase of the project.\n\nThe other project, the San Clemente Shoreline Protection Project, involves placing about 251,000 cubic yards of sand on the beach, covering a distance of about 3,400 feet, or 2/3 of a mile.\n\nIt also will widen the beach about 50 feet, while focusing on providing protection for the Los Angeles \u2013 San Diego \u2013 San Luis Obispo Rail Corridor (LOSSAN) tracks that run immediately adjacent to the San Clemente coast.\n\nLevin secured $9.3 million in federal funding for the San Clemente project through the Fiscal Year 2022 funding bill.\n\nHe joined the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and elected officials Thursday in announcing the pacts to proceed with the work.\n\n\u201cThe sand replenishment work will address some of the biggest coastal and infrastructure challenges facing our region,\u201d Levin said in a statement. \u201cAfter years of fighting for our communities, along with the work of local partners, I\u2019m proud these crucial funding streams will benefit our communities, and I look forward to seeing the projects begin soon.\u201d\n\nMayor Lesa Heebner of Solana Beach said the project in her city \u201cwill protect and preserve our beaches and bluffs from coastal erosion.\u201d She added that it \u201crepresents the culmination of years of planning and coordination between the cities of Solana Beach and Encinitas, State Parks\u2019 Division of Boating and Waterways and the US Army Corps of Engineers.\u201d\n\nEncinitas city officials said the project, set to begin in the fall, is the first phase of 50 years of coastal resiliency plans that have been in development since 2000.\n\nSegment 1 includes construction of a 50-foot-wide protective beach berm extending north of Swami\u2019s Beach to south of Beacon\u2019s Beach. Replenishment of the berm will occur approximately every five years, officials said.\n\nSegment 2 is within Solana Beach, covering Fletcher Cove and south to just outside of the Del Mar city limit."

Discover SCENE\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) platform Hxro announced that a newly-formed studio, Bitblox Games, has been created to develop on-chain, player-versus-player (PvP) gambling games that leverage Hxro\u2019s Solana-based platform.\n\nIn a blog post Thursday, Hxro said that Bitblox Games is where \"OG degens meet crypto degens,\" referring to the crypto slang term for risk-loving traders or \u201cdegenerates.\u201d It has also appointed Hxro\u2019s VP Business Development Brandt Page to serve as Bitblox Games\u2019 CEO.\n\n\u201cBitblox dramatically expands the scope of what igaming can be,\u201d said Page in the announcement. \u201cBlockchain-based gaming provides additional transparency to igaming operators while giving players the ability to bet in new and engaging ways.\u201d\n\nOG degens \ud83e\udd1d Crypto degens Bitblox Games has launched a studio to bring crypto gaming to the $67.9B online gambling industry, with all games being built exclusively on Hxro Network\u2019s core protocols.

Twitch called unregulated gambling sites \u201cunsafe\u201d in a blog post, and in October 2022, banned creators from livestreaming online gambling sites like Stake, which allows users to gamble with crypto.\n\nThe online gambling industry saw $5 billion in revenue last year, according to the American Gaming Association, but easier access to gambling also makes it easier for players to encounter the potential downsides that come with such activities.\n\nThe National Association of Addiction Professionals reported that \u201cproblem gambling\u201d is linked to a higher suicide rate than alcohol or substance abuse, while the National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that roughly two million Americans struggle with a severe gambling problem."
