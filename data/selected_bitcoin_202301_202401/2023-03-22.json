        "content": "Cryptocurrencies fell on Wednesday as investors weighed the latest policy decision from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBitcoin slid 4.8% to $26,895.88, according to Coin Metrics. Ether fell 4.1% to $1,726.58, following a big move higher on Tuesday.\n\nThe Fed enacted a quarter percentage point interest rate increase at the conclusion of its latest policy meeting, expressing caution about the recent banking crisis and indicating that hikes are nearing an end. Fed projections call for just one more hike this year.\n\nA 25 basis point increase was widely anticipated. The decision makes it the ninth consecutive interest rate hike and the second quarter-point increase in a row after a series of bigger rate hikes were implemented throughout 2022.\n\n\"The hope was that the long-awaited dovish tone from the Fed would finally arrive in the midst of this banking crisis. Those hopes were dashed by Powell's comments that rate hikes could continue as long as things continued to stabilize, weakening some of the momentum that has been leading crypto's rise in recent days,\" said Michael Safai at the crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital.\n\n\"A lot of what has driven the latest bitcoin rally \u2013 the ongoing weakness in the banking system and the potential for increases in central bank balance sheets \u2013 hasn't disappeared completely,\" he added. \"This could provide a floor for cryptocurrencies once the broader institutional reaction to the Fed settles down.\""

The company is producing a hard limit of 30,000 units, mirroring the hard money scarcity of bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWe believe the future is bright for Bitcoin, and that is one of the main reasons we pursued this project,\u201d said Chris Coradini, owner of ProSnacktive Sales LLC. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun way to promote Bitcoin and leave a long-lasting impression with all crypto, collectible, and candy enthusiasts alike! And yes, bitcoin was used to help fund this project!\u201d\n\nWhile the markets are suffering a downturn and news of acquisitions, liquidation events and volatile prices crowd investors\u2019 screens, ProSnacktive intends for this product to be a well-deserved break from the market madness.\n\nThe company noted that while these PEZ dispensers might not need to be HODLed quite as tightly as one\u2019s bitcoin, they still might be worth holding onto as a collectible. One local Connecticut resident and PEZ collector is already excited for the product launch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to hear that Bitcoin was adopted as a custom PEZ design,\u201d local Connecticut resident Phil Grimaldi said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to be buying more Bitcoin before the dispenser goes on sale. I hope I am lucky enough to get one. PEZ and Bitcoin to the moon!\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Ark's Cathie Wood: Bitcoin's Strength Through Bank Crisis Will Attract Institutional Investors\n\nListen to the CoinMarketRecap podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Google Podcasts\n\nArk Invest's Cathie Wood predicted that Bitcoin's strength during the recent banking crisis will bring back institutional investors who have been pushed away by regulators focusing attention on the bitcoins on their balance sheets.\n\nBitcoin is up almost 70% this year and 21% this month as small crypto-friendly banks like Silvergate and Signature were lost along with Silicon Valley Bank, and even mainstream banks like First Republic and Credit Suisse have been hit hard enough to require big rescues and in the latter's case, a bargain basement buyout.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg on March 21, Wood noted that \"one of the things that happens in a crisis is liquidity dries out so that that tends to hurt assets.\" But, she added:\n\nIn a recent report, Ark recommended that institutional investors interested in digital assets should target 2.5% to 6.5% to Bitcoin, she said.\n\n\"So not crazy,\" Wood added. She said:\n\nIn Ark's Big Ideas 2023 report, the base case Bitcoin price prediction was $682,000 by 2030, while the bear case was more than $250,000 and the bull case nearly $1.5 million.\n\nWood said the base case price, she believes, is \"quite conservative.\"\n\nLast week, Ark Invest revealed that it has raised $16 million for a new private crypto fund.\n\nMeanwhile, Wood, who has been buying swaths of Coinbase shares over the last few months, sold $13.5 million worth of COIN on March 21.\n\nThat's after Ark Invest bought about $30 million worth in February and another $30 million in the week of March 6. After its last buy, on March 10, Ark Invest owned 9.9 million shares of Coinbase. Wood has long been a strong supporter of Coinbase, despite its abysmal performance in 2022, when its share price declined 86%.\n\nThat said, she did make some big sells last year, dumping 1.4 million in July alone, although she bought a lot later in the year.\n\nSo what happened? Well, COIN is up almost 150% since the beginning of the year, closing at $83.99 on Tuesday after starting the year at $33.60. And it's up more than a third since March 10. So, while she is a long-term investor, a bit of profit taking does seem like a possibility."

        "content": "In this article BTC.BS=-USS\n\nBTC.CB=\n\nBTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin has rallied nearly 70% so far this year \u2014 and industry insiders who spoke to CNBC remain bullish, with one saying the world's biggest cryptocurrency could reach new heights. Bitcoin previously hit its all-time high of $68,990.90 in November 2021. Since then it has fallen about 60%. Marshall Beard, chief strategy officer at U.S.-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, said $100,000 could be a possibility for bitcoin. \"I think bitcoin probably breaks all-time highs this year,\" Beard said, adding that the $100,000 price figure is an \"interesting number.\" Beard said that if bitcoin gets to its previous record high of near $69,000, \"it doesn't take much more for it to lift up\" to $100,000. Bitcoin would need to rally around 270% to hit $100,000.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at stablecoin issuer Tether, said bitcoin could \"retest\" its all-time high near $69,000. The predictions of new record highs mark a more optimistic outlook than in January when industry executives told CNBC that they expected 2023 to be a year of caution.\n\nIs bitcoin finally becoming 'digital gold'?\n\nPart of the industry's positive view on bitcoin right now actually stems from how the asset has performed during the banking turmoil sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the failure of two crypto-friendly lenders Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank. Instead of crashing, bitcoin rallied. Bitcoin proponents say this is evidence that bitcoin is offering an alternative to the traditional banking system as a place for people to keep their money safe. \"I think the rally is explicable by saying, people have got freaked out by the banking system by the collapses,\" Oliver Linch, CEO of Bittrex Global, told CNBC in an interview at Paris Blockchain Week on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has been stealthily rising in 2023. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nFor many years, bitcoin advocates have argued bitcoin is a form of \"digital gold\" \u2014 a safe-haven asset that can provide investors a hedge against inflation and an investment in times of turmoil. But over the past few years, bitcoin has traded in correlation with stocks, in particular the tech-heavy Nasdaq. There are now signs of decoupling with bitcoin massively outperforming the Nasdaq, many other risk-assets and gold this year. But bitcoin also got a boost on hopes the banking crisis maybe reduce the U.S. Federal Reserve's ability to be as aggressive on interest rate rises, which would be supportive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe $1 million bitcoin bet\n\nDiscussion of where the digital coin's price could go this year has been rife since Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and the former technology chief at Coinbase, wagered on Mar. 17 that bitcoin would be worth $1 million or more in 90 days. He bet $2 million. The wager was in response to a Twitter user who said that they would bet $1 million that the U.S. does not enter hyperinflation. Srinivasan argued that the \"world redenominates on Bitcoin as digital gold\" as hyperinflation kicks in, erodes the value of the U.S. dollar, and nations, individuals and companies begin to buy large amounts of bitcoin. Hyperinflation is the massive rise in prices in an economy.\n\nI think for bitcoin to be a million dollars in 90 days, some crazy things are happening in the world, which we don't want. Marshall Beard Chief strategy officer, Gemini"
