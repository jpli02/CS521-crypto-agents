        "content": "Renton, United States --News Direct-- Chainwire\n\nStably, a leading Stablecoin-as-a-Service (SCaaS) and fiat on/off-ramp infrastructure provider for Web3 projects, is aiming to revolutionize the nascent Bitcoin ordinals market by launching its US Dollar (USD)-backed stablecoin, Stably USD, as a natively-issued BRC20 token under the symbol #USD. This groundbreaking development marks a critical milestone in the exponentially growing Bitcoin ordinals ecosystem that is now reaching half a billion dollars in total market capitalization in less than six months.\n\n#USD is a BRC20 standard stablecoin created via the Bitcoin ordinals protocol which was introduced in January 2023 after the recent Taproot upgrade. BRC20 tokens use a technique called ordinal inscriptions to attach data to individual satoshis, the smallest unit of a bitcoin. These satoshis can then represent anything from digital art ownership to \u201cmeme coins\u201d and even stablecoins.\n\nAccording to Stably, every #USD token is backed 1-to-1 with USD held by a US-regulated custodian in a collateral account for the benefit of KYC/AML-verified token holders. Monthly reports for the account are also conducted by a third-party stablecoin attestor to ensure #USD tokens are always fully collateralized with USD.\n\n\"When I met Domo, the creator of the BRC20 standard, at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, I told him about our upcoming plans for #USD,\" said Kory Hoang, Stably\u2019s CEO and Co-Founder. \u201cHe thought it was great and funny how we are creating a stablecoin on Bitcoin to enable Bitcoin trading on-chain\u2026 With a stablecoin built on Bitcoin. I\u2019m still chuckling about it to this day, actually. In just one week after that, however, we made it happen!\u201d\n\nThe integration of BRC20 #USD into the Bitcoin network is part of Stably\u2019s mission to power the next billion Web3 users with a seamless fiat-to-crypto and stablecoin onramp to all popular and emerging blockchain networks.

Stably states that it is employing a manual process of issuance/redemption for #USD\u2019s initial launch but plans to release support for automatic issuance/redemption through its Stably Ramp widget during Q3 2023. By then, users of #USD will be able to on/off-ramp via more traditional payment methods like ACH, instant ACH, and credit/debit cards, in addition to bank wires.\n\nFounded in 2018, the 20+ team member Seattle FinTech is backed by leading institutional and angel investors in the crypto space, such as Morgan Creek Capital, BEENEXT, 500 Startups, Hard Yaka, CREAM Labs, Sunny Lu of VeChain, and Paul Stahura of Donuts, Inc. The company has raised over $7.5-million in total funding to-date, $5-million of which was collected during its last Pre-Series A round in December 2021. Stably has also expanded its fiat on/off-ramp and stablecoin natively to more than 10 emerging networks, including Arbitrum, XRP Ledger, Stellar, Tezos, VeChainThor, Harmony, Polymesh, Coreum, ICON, and Chia Network.\n\nAbout Stably\n\nStably is a Web3 payment infrastructure provider and FinCEN-registered MSB from Seattle. The company specializes in providing stablecoins and fiat <> crypto on and off-ramps to users of Web3 applications.
