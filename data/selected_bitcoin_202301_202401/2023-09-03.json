The club, based in Bedford, a market town with a population of 170,000 in Bedfordshire, England, is the passion project of local owner and Bitcoin evangelist Peter McCormack.\n\nThe host of the \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did\u201d podcast \u2014 a Bitcoin-based current affairs show that positions the cryptocurrency as a remedy for socioeconomic issues such as rising inflation and state debt \u2014 spoke animatedly on the day of the match about the changes the club has seen under his ownership, and the role that Bitcoin has played in it.\n\n\u201cTeams should care about something,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery club has a history of where it came from. It\u2019s usually the community they were in.\u201d His ownership has brought with it the international reach and decentralized philosophy of Bitcoin \u2014 a \u201cglobal community that cares about hard working people not having the fruits of their labor debased by government mismanagement of money,\u201d he added.\n\nBut financial reliance on a cryptocurrency brings with it certain complications \u2014 including market volatility and industry implosions beyond the Real Bedford owner\u2019s control.\n\nBear market\n\nMcCormack completed the purchase of Real Bedford \u2014 a South Midlands Division One side then known as Bedford FC \u2014 in April 2022 on the back of various business ventures linked to Bitcoin. He said at the time of the takeover that, with Bitcoin-backed financing, he wants to put the club in a position to rise nine tiers to the Premier League \u2014 the pinnacle of English football.\n\n3/ So what is the plan?

But in March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. Then in May that year, stablecoin platform Terra-Luna collapsed, followed by the FTX cryptocurrency exchange in November. A bear market mentality settled over the crypto industry as investors shied away from riskier assets, including Bitcoin. Prices dropped, while over US$2 trillion was wiped off the wider market.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a high of almost US$70,000, Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted to less than US$16,000 by the end of 2022. While it recovered some of that ground to trade within the US$26,000 range as of early September, analysts expect macroeconomic concerns to continue to weigh on the token\u2019s price \u2014 at least in the short term.\n\n\u201cThe main headwind for crypto is rising real interest rates,\u201d said Samuel Lee, founder of U.S.-based SVRN Asset Management, an investment advisory firm. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see a sustained resurgence until interest rates drop back down again and people forget about the trauma and folly of the last bubble.\u201d\n\nCould an extended period of crypto winter combined with further declines in the price of Bitcoin impact Real Bedford?\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t worry me because I fundamentally believe there\u2019s a far higher chance of the pound failing than Bitcoin,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cI think a more important question is: is the club sustainable if we don\u2019t keep winning?\u201d\n\nLocal link\n\nReal Bedford field\n\nAs the referee blew his whistle for the start of last week\u2019s game at McMullen Park, the realities of ninth-tier English football set in. With the music off, the fans quietened down, their cheers replaced by the sound of the wind blowing through the trees lining the ground and a motorway running opposite. It was a long way from the glamor of the Premier League.\n\n\u201cBedford isn\u2019t really known for anything,\u201d said McCormack, 44, who has lived in the town most of his life. \u201cIf a tourist comes to the U.K., most people go to London or Manchester or Bath. There\u2019s no reason to come to Bedford.\u201d\n\nMark Anderson, a local software engineer who volunteers at the club on Saturdays, was more direct. \u201cBedfordshire is basically the arse-end of the nice bits,\u201d he said, referring to the county\u2019s location north of Greater London on the periphery of some of Britain\u2019s most desirable real estate.\n\nBut it is McCormack\u2019s connection to the local area, the Real Bedford owner said, that gives him an advantage over other sporting ownership models backed by digital assets.\n\n\u201cThis has meaning to me because it\u2019s my town,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important thing I\u2019m doing. The town of Bedford should have a team in the Football League.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to fourth-tier English football team Crawley Town \u2014 bought by U.S. crypto consortium WAGMI United in April 2022 \u2014 as an example of an ownership model without a link to the local community. WAGMI, like McCormack, promised to take the club to the pinnacle of English football. But rather than Bitcoin, they planned to use sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to build Crawley\u2019s brand and establish an international fan base.\n\nThe project got off to a promising start, earning \u00a33.5 million (US$4.4 million) from its first NFT drop. But against the backdrop of last year\u2019s turbulence in the crypto market, the new owners became increasingly involved in day-to-day footballing operations \u2014 including a brief stint on the coach\u2019s bench for co-owner Preston Johnson. The club went into a tailspin, suffering its worst finish in twelve years in the football league and narrowly avoiding relegation.\n\nWhile WAGMI United didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, Reuben Watt, Chair of the Crawley Town Supporters Alliance, said that by the end of last season, confidence in the group\u2019s ownership was at an \u201call-time low.\u201d He worried that the owners had consistently focused on pleasing NFT holders over local fans.\n\nConcern among fans appears to have sunk in. WAGMI appointed Sam Jordan, a member of the Supporter\u2019s Alliance, to the board of directors in August.\n\n\u201cI think the appointment of Sam to the club\u2019s board is a huge turning point for the club,\u201d said Watt. \u201cHad WAGMI got in someone with knowledge of English football straight away and put a fan on the board, then we would\u2019ve been in a better situation.\u201d\n\nMcCormack didn\u2019t hold back in his criticism of the Crawley owners. \u201cI think they bought it as a toy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey bought a toy under the hype, probably watched a bunch of Ted Lasso and got excited. They\u2019ve done a terrible job.\u201d\n\nHe also identified issues with the WAGMI group\u2019s association with crypto assets like meme coins and NFTs \u2014 which are fundamentally different, he said, to Bitcoin \u2014 as another flaw in its business model.\n\n\u201cThey basically want to just get people to buy crap that will lose value \u2014 which has been proven historically \u2014 whereas for us, Bitcoin is a monetary asset,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis war we see between Bitcoin and crypto is reflected in the ethos of how we run our clubs. Bitcoin is in our DNA, but we\u2019re also about building that feeling around the town that this is a community thing,\u201d he added.\n\nBitcoin backers\n\nwhT81kxU7gg7esBeHPNaCYf4 aXkds0rZ3CDdLcCpVFXzp9CXDRPsYW0Y6c9dn8ej6jiPyg3nbMizkq7sWcNQFq1YdI2s4AHRuJLfsIsCYXJVkEy tVqZeDy3CE4f3a114Gsd57XuC8QqHfZ5mEiFo\n\nLast season, Real Bedford won its division at a canter, earning promotion to the South Midlands Premier Division. Much of the financing behind that run came from large-scale sponsorship. The club has partnership agreements with a host of Bitcoin companies, including Iris Energy, a sustainable Bitcoin mining firm; Galaxy, a crypto firm dealing in corporate finance; and Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAccording to the club\u2019s records, sponsorship provided \u00a3387,900 (US$491,000) out of the club\u2019s \u00a3549,507 (US$696,000) revenue in the 22/23 season \u2014 a significant amount given that ninth-tier clubs typically only have sponsorship deals in the four to five figure range.\n\nThe revenue brought in through tie-ups with the likes of Gemini \u2014 who, according to a spokesperson, view the Real Bedford partnership as a form of Bitcoin-backed community building \u2014 allows the club to make improvements to its facilities and player welfare in a way unmatched by the league\u2019s other teams.\n\nAnd while the sponsorship revenue gives the club a huge advantage in its ability to attract players, the Bitcoin connection also acts as a magnet for attracting supporters from further afield \u2014 football fans who may not otherwise have chosen Bedford as a place to spend their Saturday afternoons.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, over 100 people have come in from other countries to watch the games here,\u201d McCormack says. \u201cWe had 12 come in from Slovakia! That\u2019s insane! And they\u2019re spending money in the hotels, in the bars, in the restaurants \u2014 that money supports our local economy.\u201d\n\nThe 256% rise in matchday attendances since the takeover has put a strain on facilities unready for the increased level of interest. The club were averaging just 40 attendees per week when McCormack took over, whereas CEO Emma Firman wrote in the week\u2019s program notes that the club is now working with local businesses to expand its designated parking for the game.\n\n\u201cOur match days are getting busier, which is exciting for everyone here at the club as more people recognise our exciting project at McMullen Park,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSustainable growth\n\nBut for all the club\u2019s progress, the club\u2019s ownership model is reliant on Bitcoin-affiliated sponsors impacted by the ongoing bear market.\n\nThe club still sits five rungs below McCormack\u2019s medium-term target of the Football League \u2014 tiers 2 to 4 \u2014 where budgets of newly promoted sides are \u00a31-3 million. Getting there will require sustained success for the next half-decade \u2014 not just for the team, but for Bitcoin-backed sponsors who will have to weather any further market volatility and declines in the token\u2019s price.\n\nCompanies across the sector have been forced to push through large-scale layoffs over the past year, with Real Bedford\u2019s main sponsor Gemini undergoing three consecutive rounds of job cuts between July 2022 and January 2023. Their spending on TV and digital advertisements alone fell from US$3.8 million to US$478,000 between May and November 2022, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cCrypto sponsor\u2019s rich marketing budgets depended on the huge crypto bubble that allowed them to raise money effortlessly,\u201d said SVRN\u2019s Samuel Lee.\n\n\u201cWith the collapse in crypto prices and waning interest in crypto, money is unsurprisingly tight. I think crypto companies are starting to realize that the payoff for expensive sports sponsorships isn\u2019t as high as they thought,\u201d Lee added.\n\nMcCormack said that he personally has little concern for a Bitcoin price drop. The U.K. economy and the pound are more vulnerable to volatility in light of the government\u2019s debt burden, he said. But he did stress the importance of achieving stability beyond a reliance on Real Bedford\u2019s Bitcoin backers.\n\ndfrkKFeDIbN5Rl X2KE5IGi543Qeb7GGim6vc 4i0IvKc3zbD0jaCDxUNRbA 3DWyUV2K Yct67s1hvuPoqI8nmUEDCBja7RNxHeGIIJ2YaQSdCaVGs OFK26ALHBBvUe xqgBZxjLBb2v2 urlfbo8\n\nOne way to do that, he said, is by growing crowds through a brand of football fans can engage with. That starts with the club\u2019s skull-heavy rebrand as The Pirates and a ramped up social media presence that leans heavily into the idea of the world\u2019s first Bitcoin-backed team as rock-n-roll disruptors.\n\n\u201cYou give people a brand of football they can support,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cWe have skulls. Skulls are f\u2013king cool. We play heavy metal when they come on the pitch. And have you seen our tunnel?\u201d\n\nBitcoin in the community\n\nThe team\u2019s brand also involves strong connections with the local area, not just through the men\u2019s team, but through community initiatives, youth and women\u2019s football. The recent FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand drew record global audiences and McCormack said he sees potential for women\u2019s football as a growth market for Real Bedford.\n\nThe club began its expansion in this area by completing a merger with Bedford Ladies and Girls FC in June. McCormack has raised the budget for the women\u2019s team, and is aiming for commercial parity with the men\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a commercial reason to do that because the town will recognize it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might come and watch, or bring their daughters to come and watch. Some people might say, \u2018oh, that\u2019s so woke\u2019 or whatever. But no, it\u2019s a commercially astute decision.\u201d\n\nMcCormack\u2019s emphasis on community building signposts a potential route for the club through the crypto winter and continuing Bitcoin bear market.\n\nUnlike Crawley, where the division between crypto backers and footballing matters has dissolved to the detriment of the club, McCormack maintains that a solid distance is kept between Real Bedford\u2019s Bitcoin financing and the team.\n\n\u201cIf you just want to come for the football, you can just have a full football experience and not have [Bitcoin] forced down your throat,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cThere\u2019s even an article on our website that says why you should not buy Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIn the short term at least, Real Bedford\u2019s focus is on growing the crowds and their fan base. And that means continuing to win, regardless of where the financing comes from.\n\n\u201cThe team\u2019s job is not to care about Bitcoin; the manager\u2019s job is not to care about Bitcoin, their job is to win games,\u201d McCormack said.\n\nAt last week\u2019s game, everyone played their parts to perfection.\n\nREAL BEDFORD 9 \u2013 1 ROTHWELL CORINTHIANS."
