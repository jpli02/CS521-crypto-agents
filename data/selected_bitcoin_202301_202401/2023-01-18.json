        "content": "Bitcoin steadied after snapping a rare 14-day winning streak as a mood of caution supplanted the risk appetite that drove up a variety of assets at the start of the year.\n\nThe largest token swung between gains and losses on Thursday and was up about 0.2% at $20,813 as of 12:50 p.m. in Singapore. Smaller coins like Solana and Polkadot posted modest increases. Bitcoin on Wednesday retreated 2.5%, ending its longest run of daily gains since 2013."

        "content": "Bitcoin has not only started the new year with a rally, its gains have outpaced those of gold. That\u2019s reversed \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 part of the 76% decline in the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio over 12 months through November, a period during which the cryptocurrency tumbled into a bear market. The gauge actually found a low two months ago and drifted sideways, taking support at resistance formerly seen in 2018 and 2019. The jump so far in 2023 signals that the barrier has now turned into a significant support area."

        "title": "Bitcoin Rallies to Recoup Losses Since FTX Collapse (Published 2023) - The New York Times",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency bulls are extending one of the most unlikely rallies of the year so far, pushing Bitcoin above $21,000 for a second day. That means the digital currency has now recouped all its losses since the spectacular collapse of FTX in November.\n\nThe rising tide has lifted most crypto boats, the DealBook newsletter reports. Even some beaten-down tokens \u2014 including FTT, the in-house token of the bankrupt exchange FTX \u2014 have rebounded as investors bet the Federal Reserve will slow its interest rate increases, leading to a broad rally of risky assets. Shares in Coinbase, the publicly traded crypto exchange that has been laying off workers and cutting costs, gained at the market open in New York; it\u2019s up more than 30 percent over the past week.\n\nBut crypto analysts are divided on whether the rally is sustainable; by Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin had fallen back below $21,000. Skeptics argue that the fundamentals for a long-term rise are missing, making the recent jump a risky bet for investors.\n\nThe crypto rally comes as lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm advising on FTX\u2019s multibillion-dollar bankruptcy, disclosed that the company\u2019s assets were worth roughly $5.5 billion, including $1.7 billion in cash and $3.5 billion in crypto assets. That makes this wider rally significant for FTX creditors \u2014 if it lasts."

        "title": "Peter Thiel's fund wound down 8-year bitcoin bet before market crash - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nFounders Fund, the venture capital firm co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, closed almost all of its eight-year bet on cryptocurrencies shortly before the market began to crash last year, generating about $1.8bn in returns.\n\nThe San Francisco-based fund made its first investment in bitcoin in early 2014 and went on to invest large sums in crypto. About two-thirds of its overall investment was used to buy bitcoin, said people close to the fund.\n\nFounders Fund sold out of the vast majority of its entire cryptocurrency portfolio by the end of March 2022 \u2014 before the digital assets market became swept up in a crisis in May last year, said one of the people close to the fund.\n\nThe fund currently has no significant exposure to cryptocurrencies, the people said. The winding-down of its crypto bet has not previously been reported. Founders Fund declined to comment.\n\nThiel, a big backer of Republican candidates and a supporter of former US president Donald Trump, was one of the earliest mainstream investors to buy large sums of bitcoin and has subsequently been loudly bullish on the digital currency.\n\nIn April 2022, about the same time that Founders Fund sold out of most of its cryptocurrency holdings, Thiel said he was optimistic about the future of bitcoin. He told a cryptocurrency conference in Miami that \u201cwe\u2019re at the end of the fiat money regime\u201d and suggested its price \u2014 which was then trading at about $44,000 \u2014 could increase by a factor of 100.\n\nThiel said JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon and BlackRock boss Larry Fink \u201cneed to be allocating some of their money to bitcoin\u201d, adding: \u201cWe need to push back on them.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin, which was launched in 2009, surged dramatically from roughly $750 in 2014 to an all-time high of more than $65,000 by November 2021. However, its price has been volatile in recent years, with several big collapses in value, including a drop to about $15,500 in November last year, a two-year low.\n\nThe digital assets market has been rocked by a crisis since May last year, forcing high-profile crypto companies such as Terraform Labs, Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows Capital into bankruptcy.\n\nMarket sentiment towards crypto was damaged further in November when FTX, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, shut down owing creditors more than $3bn, and its co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was charged with multiple fraud charges.\n\nBy December, bitcoin had lost about three-quarters of its value from its peak and more than $2tn had been wiped off the value of the global crypto market.\n\nSeveral blue-chip Silicon Valley investors have piled into digital currencies in recent years, although most have focused their investments on equity stakes in crypto businesses rather than buying cryptocurrencies directly.\n\nSome exceptions to this include A16z crypto \u2014 the crypto arm of venture firm Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 which raised a $4.5bn fund last year and also invests directly in crypto coins and tokens.\n\nSimilarly, Paradigm, a crypto venture firm founded in 2018 by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang, raised a $2.5bn fund in late 2021.\n\nBut many large financial institutions stayed away from cryptocurrencies over fears about cyber security and their links to money laundering and drug trafficking. In 2017, JPMorgan\u2019s Dimon called bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d.\n\nFounders Fund\u2019s shift on crypto, which had been one of its core positions, was one of about nine big exits the venture fund made between 2020 and the end of last year that allowed it to return roughly $13bn to investors.\n\nOther exits also included the initial public offerings of companies it had backed since their early fundraisings, such as Airbnb and Palantir, the data analytics group that Thiel co-founded.\n\nThiel co-founded PayPal in 1998 and went on to become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most successful investors, including being the first venture capitalist to back Facebook.\n\nFounders Fund has more than $11bn under management, including $5bn of capital raised across two funds last year, and has taken stakes in more than 100 companies, such as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, ride-hailing app Lyft and defence tech group Anduril.\n\nThe fund is in talks to take an equity stake in OpenAI, the developer behind chatbot ChatGPT, at a valuation of $29bn."

        "title": "Bitcoin surges as investors return to riskier assets - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe price of bitcoin has surged nearly 30 per cent against the dollar in January, raising hopes among its faithful followers that the crypto market is emerging from the credit crisis that gripped it for much of last year.\n\nThe token, the most actively traded in the industry, has soared to more than $21,000 in the past week, breaking out of the tight range around $17,000 upon which it had settled following the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in November.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has joined traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds in rallying this year as investors become increasingly confident that the US Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of rapid rates rises to combat inflation is beginning to moderate. Last week, the US consumer price index posted an inflation rate of 6.5 per cent in December, the sixth consecutive month of decline.\n\n\n\nAlthough bitcoin enthusiasts argue the token can be a hedge against inflation, in the past year it has often fluctuated in line with shifts in consumer prices and interest rate expectations. The price began to tumble from its record high of nearly $70,000 in November 2021 when investors realised inflation was soaring.\n\n\u201cThe overall rally across most asset classes year to date due to hopes of a \u2018soft landing\u2019 for the US economy is boosting sentiment in crypto,\u201d said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, JPMorgan managing director focused on alternatives and digital assets.\n\nHe added that a weakening dollar also helped as it boosted the price of commodities such as gold, in turn helping to \u201creprice bitcoin as a substitute asset class\u201d.\n\nThe optimism has spread to other crypto-related assets. Ether, the second most traded cryptocurrency, has risen 31 per cent this month to more than $1,575, according to Refinitiv data. The token is widely used as a building block for ambitious crypto projects because it allows programmers to code functions to automatically buy and sell assets.\n\nOverall, the market value of the top 500 crypto tokens has risen back to $1tn from $830bn at the end of last year. It remains well off its November 2021 peak above $3.2tn, according to data from the Financial Times Digital Assets Dashboard.\n\n\u201cIf inflation is now retreating, pressure on the Fed and other central banks to raise rates aggressively will be reduced, enabling a gentle shift back to more \u2018risk-on\u2019 strategies,\u201d said Edmond Goh, head of trading at B2C2, a crypto market maker.\n\nHowever, confidence in crypto markets remains fragile, in part because investors are wary of further sudden shocks after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX.\n\n\u201cSome upside volatility was due to come eventually and does not mean that this move upwards will be sustainable,\u201d said David Moreno Darocas, research lead at data provider CryptoCompare.\n\nThe fate of Genesis, one of the biggest lenders in the crypto market, in particular is uncertain. It halted customer withdrawals at its lending unit in November after FTX\u2019s failure, blaming \u201cunprecedented market turmoil\u201d and owes its creditors more than $3bn. Its parent, crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group, is trying to raise capital and avoid the bankruptcy of Genesis.\n\nOther bellwether names, including crypto-focused bank Silvergate and crypto exchanges Coinbase and Crypto.com, said they would extensively cut headcount.\n\nResearch provider Kaiko noted that prices rallied last week in part because traders who were betting on bitcoin to fall were caught in a short squeeze, pushing prices higher.\n\nIt also pointed out that market liquidity, or the ability to easily buy and sell assets at prevailing market prices, remained very weak. Nearly 90 per cent of bitcoin trades are conducted using a stablecoin, tokens intended to track real-world currencies and maintain a steady value, it said.\n\nLiquidity for both bitcoin and ether, as measured by the number of offers to buy and sell the tokens within 2 per cent of their price against the stablecoin Tether, had fallen by a fifth since early January to levels seen in the aftermath of the FTX fallout, Kaiko found.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unclear why liquidity temporarily recovered but failed to stick around, especially over the past few days, which has seen the highest trade volumes since early November,\u201d it said.\n\nBut some see another possible market shakeout as the last squeeze of a market that has been caught in a whirlwind since the sudden failure of the TerraUSD stablecoin last May.\n\n\u201cIn my view, Genesis is the last domino to wobble since this sorry contagion crisis began with Terra months ago,\u201d said Ian Taylor, board adviser at CryptoUK, a British crypto lobby group. \u201cEven if Genesis files for bankruptcy, it\u2019s kind of priced in.\u201d"
