        "content": "Bitcoin has dropped more than 30% from when Warren Buffett described it as 'rat poison squared': Here are 3 stocks he's invested in that outperformed crypto\n\nBillionaire Warren Buffett memorably described Bitcoin as \u201crat poison squared\u201d during a shareholder meeting in April 2022. Bitcoin was trading near $40,000 at the time. It\u2019s now trading at around $36,288.\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Class A stock has outperformed the cryptocurrency and recently reached an all-time high, surpassing $560,000. Presently, the Class A stock sits above $545,000.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord\n\nRising prices are throwing off Americans' retirement plans \u2014 here's how to get your savings back on track\n\n'A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency \u2014 3 ways you can prepare\n\nUnsurprisingly, Buffett hasn\u2019t changed his mind about the world\u2019s most persistent digital obsession. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people do stupid things all my life,\u201d Buffett said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year, comparing betting on Bitcoin to playing the slots in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had an explosion of gambling, essentially. And I like to bet on a football game \u2014 if I\u2019m sitting and watching, it makes it more interesting. But I don\u2019t think I want to make a living trying to bet against the house.\u201d\n\nInstead of crypto, Buffett has been laser-focused on his preferred asset class: equities. Here are the top three stocks he\u2019s invested in over the past year that have outperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin.\n\nLennar Corp.\n\nBuffett seems to be focused on American homebuilders right now. He added a stake in Lennar Corporation (LEN) sometime in the second quarter of 2023, according to recent regulatory filings.\n\nThe Florida-based company is one of the largest home builders in the country. That puts it in a favorable position given the shortage of homes across America. Between 2012 and 2022, there were 6.5 million more households formed than homes constructed. If this gap continues to widen, demand for homebuilding could skyrocket.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett seems to be betting on this trend, adding two other homebuilders, NVR (NVR) and DR Horton (DHI), to his portfolio during the second quarter.\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nDiageo\n\nIn the first quarter of the year, Buffett added a stake in British alcoholic beverage giant Diageo (DEO). But the Oracle of Omaha is no stranger to sin stocks, having acquired a sizable stake in Guinness, the beer brand that would eventually be combined with other brands to form Diageo, back in the 1990s.\n\nAt the time, Buffett even compared the investment to his most famous bet. \u201cIn the sense of where they earn their profits \u2014 continent-by-continent \u2014 Coca-Cola and Guinness display strong similarities,\" he wrote in a letter to investors that year.\n\nNow, Diageo is back in the Berkshire portfolio, and that\u2019s probably a sign that the company is undervalued. The stock trades at just under 19 times earnings per share and offers a 2.57% dividend yield. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's dividend yield is 0% and has a non-existent price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nOccidental Petroleum\n\nWarren Buffett is clearly bullish on energy, at least in the medium term. That\u2019s why he started accumulating a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) last year and now controls over 25% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares.\n\nThe price of crude oil has rebounded in recent months. In fact, it hit a 10-month high recently and experts expect demand to keep a price floor on the commodity for the year ahead. That\u2019s a major tailwind for oil producers like Occidental.\n\nBuffett\u2019s bet on energy giants is now a key part of his portfolio. Considering how cheap these companies are (Occidental stock trades at 11 times earnings), retail investors should consider taking a closer look too.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
