        "content": "For much of the four years since he won office, El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele has relished his role as an anti-establishment warrior.\n\nHe sacked judges, exited a regional anti-corruption pact, spurned the International Monetary Fund and adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. All the while, he seemed wholly indifferent to what foreign investors thought of him."

Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nCrypto markets rose on Thursday, shrugging off a tougher regulatory stance from the U.S. government. Bitcoin gained 2.06% to $24,500.00 at around 4:04 p.m. ET while ether was up 1.21% at $1,679.31, according to Coin Metrics. There are \" increasing signs that the market bottomed last November and has turned bullish,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"We are gaining in momentum here and any bad news is being shrugged off, typical signs that the market believes the worst is over.\"\n\nCrypto markets were on edge earlier this week following increased regulatory scrutiny from U.S. authorities on digital currencies. On Monday, the New York State Department of Financial Services told Paxos to stop minting new Binance USD, or BUSD, stablecoins. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a real-world asset and some are backed by assets such as bonds or cash. BUSD is pegged one-to-one to the U.S. dollar. Paxos also confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has notified the company that the agency could recommend an action that alleges BUSD is a security. The SEC has not yet formally levelled any charges against Paxos.\n\nFlows into bitcoin"

        "content": "A similar issue was front and center on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, when the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing to discuss new safeguards for crypto investors, a possible first step toward legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s time now to consider how to protect consumers from unregulated digital assets, and ultimately, who we want our financial system to serve,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and the committee chairman.\n\nOn Monday, New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos, a crypto firm, to cease creating BUSD, a so-called stablecoin, because of \u201cunresolved issues\u201d over its relationship with the crypto exchange Binance, which carried the coin\u2019s branding.\n\nLast week, the S.E.C. charged the crypto exchange Kraken with securities violations, arguing its \u201cstaking\u201d practice \u2014 in which users pledge crypto holdings to companies in exchange for hefty returns \u2014 was akin to selling an unregistered investment contract.\n\nAnd then there is the shadow of the spectacular implosion of FTX, which left investigators on a global hunt to recover billions in missing assets. Amid attempts to claw back funds to repay FTX\u2019s customers, attention has recently turned to $400 million that\u2019s sitting in an interest-bearing bank account.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind the Bitcoin rally? Some say that it\u2019s a so-called short squeeze, in which those who have bet against Bitcoin have to cover their positions by buying more. Another explanation is tax-loss harvesting, in which investors sell at a loss at the end of the year to reduce their tax hit, and then add to their holdings again when the calendar flips. A third potential factor: Crypto investors appear to be selling their holdings in so-called altcoins and putting that money into the relatively more established Bitcoin."

        "content": "Billionaire investor Charlie Munger isn't a fan of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman called the form of virtual currency \"worthless\" during Wednesday's annual shareholder meeting of the Daily Journal Corporation, a publishing company where he's a director.\n\n\"Sometimes I call it crypto 'crappo,' sometimes I call it 'crypto s---.' It's just ridiculous that anybody would buy this stuff,\" Munger, 99, told CNBC's Becky Quick during a livestream of the event, adding: \"It's totally absolutely crazy, stupid gambling.\"\n\nCryptocurrency's advocates maintain that digital assets offer privacy, security, better transaction speeds and lower costs than traditional financial institutions.\n\nBut Munger, a longtime stock investor with a net worth of $2.3 billion, doesn't buy it. \"I think the people who oppose my position are idiots, so I don't think there is a rational argument against my position,\" he said.\n\nMunger's comments come amid an avalanche of problems for crypto investors over the past year.\n\nThe crypto market lost roughly $2 trillion last year. Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, lost more than 60% of its value in 2022. And the implosion of FTX, a now-bankrupt crypto trading platform once valued at $32 billion, has shaken investors' confidence as the industry feels the ripple effects of the company's collapse.\n\n\"Many Americans are coming to realize that cryptocurrency is just a speculative mania and the industry is rife with crooks,\" James Royal, a principal reporter at Bankrate, tells CNBC Make It. Indeed, just 8% of Americans have a positive view of cryptocurrency as of November, according to the CNBC All-America Economic Survey.\n\nOn Wednesday, Munger said he's not proud of his country \"for allowing this crap.\" He's previously urged the U.S. government to ban cryptocurrencies, and may partially get his wish as the crypto industry faces rising regulatory crackdowns.\n\nIncreased scrutiny of crypto-trading firms and investment advisors are among the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's top priorities this year, as outlined in the agency's \"2023 Examination Priorities Report.\"\n\nThe SEC's examinations will focus on the \"offer, sale, recommendation of or advice regarding trading in crypto or crypto-related assets,\" the report says.\n\nThe agency voted Wednesday to expand federal rules that, if passed into law, could require crypto exchanges to hold their assets with a federal- or state-chartered bank to act as a custodian over customers' virtual currency.\n\nThe proposal puts crypto firms in a \"no-win\" scenario, SEC commissioner Mark Uyeda wrote in a statement on Wednesday. U.S. regulators have already warned banks that dealing with crypto exposes them to an array of risks, including fraud and scam.\n\n\"In other words, an adviser may custody crypto assets at a bank, but banks are cautioned by their regulators not to custody crypto assets,\" Uyeda wrote.\n\nGet CNBC's free Warren Buffett Guide to Investing, which distills the billionaire's No. 1 best piece of advice for regular investors, do's and don'ts, and three key investing principles into a clear and simple guidebook.\n\nSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"
