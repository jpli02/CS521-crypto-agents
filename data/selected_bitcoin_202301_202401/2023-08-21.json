        "content": "The crypto market was lower to start the week after bitcoin posted its worst week since May.\n\nBitcoin was higher by just 0.02% at the $26,136.36, according to Coin Metrics. Last week, it lost 11% due to a sharp decline that began Wednesday afternoon. Ether was lower by 0.18% at $1,674\n\nAltcoins were making bigger moves to the downside on Monday, however. Ripple's XRP slid nearly 5%. Coins tied to Ethereum competitors Solana , Polygon and Cardano lost about 3% each. DeFi tokens fell also. The Cosmos token lost more than 3% and Uniswap's coin was 2% lower.\n\n\"External pressure in China is likely the biggest driver to the sell-offs,\" said Chris Martin, head of research at Amberdata. \"Asia plays a huge role in crypto, especially with Hong Kong and Singapore opening the door, but with a wider economic downturn, I don't think we'll see the bull market play out like we hoped or expected.\""

Despite finding some support near $25,000, many analysts anticipate a further decline toward the critical $20,000 mark. This implies that traders are currently adopting a risk-averse approach in the short term.Bitcoin has taken multiple supports in the past at the crucial level of $25,000 (Horizontal trendline & 50% Fibonacci Retracement). This time too, the prices have bounced slightly after testing the support and the lower longer shadow indicates buying around these levels. If it holds and sustains above $25k then we can expect the bulls to resume the up-move whereas a break and close below the support will lead to further downfall.Crypto Cart: Quick Glance (Source: coinmarketcap.com, data as of 11.17 hours, IST on August 21, 2023)Bitcoin $26,124 0.06%Ethereum $1,680 0.78%Tether $0.9997 -0.02%BNB $216.39 -0.04%XRP $0.5311 2.03%Cardano $0.2705 1.44%Dogecoin $0.06379 -0.40%Solana $21.61 -0.75%Polygon $0.5761 0.32%Litecoin $66.53 3.34%Polkadot $4.49 0.27%Tron $0.07614 2.56%Shiba Inu $0.000008314 -1.53%(Note: Price change in last 24 hours)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "Bitcoin spot ETF: What are the odds of approval? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Questions are swirling about whether or not the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin ETF (BTC-USD). Yahoo Finance Crypto Reporter David Hollerith explains that eight companies have filed for approval since BlackRock (BLK) did so back in June. Hollerith explains the situation, stating \"The SEC has several opportunities from here to either approve, deny or push off approval for these applications.\" Hollerith notes that many argue that Bitcoin is \"not regulated enough and too manipulatable\" as reasons for pushback against the potential spot ETF.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, a lot of speculation has surrounded the chances of a Bitcoin spot ETF being approved, given how much scrutiny the sector is feeling from regulators. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith to discuss this more. David, we know that-- we've been hearing a lot about the potential for this, but not seeing any companies quite make it to the finish line just yet.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Hey, Rachelle. Since BlackRock's filing, which happened earlier this summer, there's been eight other companies who've refiled applications to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, and that's included ARK Invest, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Invesco.\n\nAnd now, the SEC has several opportunities from here to either approve, deny, or simply push off approval for these applications. They can't push off approval after six months from now. That's when we'll have a definite decision about whether or not the agency would be OK with listing these products.\n\nBut that being said, earlier this month, ARK Invest application was pushed off approval, and the deadline for these other applications from the other asset managers are coming at the beginning of September. And John Reed Stark, who is a former attorney for the SEC's enforcement division, weighed in on this at the beginning of-- or excuse me, the end of last week. And he had said, he puts the chances at slim to none.\n\nStory continues\n\nStark, obviously having worked for the agency, does know a lot about the enforcement division, and his thoughts are that the Bitcoin spot market is too-- it's a little bit too not regulated enough and a little bit too manipulable, which has been the argument in past years for a why there's been no approval.\n\nBut a lot of people have really come out around the BlackRock filing. And Bloomberg's ETF team-- Bloomberg Intelligence's ETF team, which has been more bullish on the prospects of approval in the coming six months has said, the question is really what could BlackRock know that these other filers didn't know at the time?\n\nThey added a surveillance sharing agreement, which has been taken as a new addition to this. And potentially, people have said that might be what will make the change for the SEC to approve it. But at this point, it is still pretty unclear about how things could go. We're looking at the Grayscale lawsuit with the SEC, which we're expecting a verdict on any week now. And that's expected usually on a Tuesday or a Friday is when these verdicts come out.\n\nAnd obviously, Grayscale is trying to convert their GBTC product into an ETF. And that's been a long battle. So we could see some more clarity into the SEC's thinking with that verdict or at least with what they have to do next, depending on the judge's interpretations. But we're not expecting it to be a clear path for ETFs either, given that the verdict could mean a few different things.\n\nBut that being said, Bloomberg's team, which again, I said, has been a little bit more bullish, has said the odds of a Bitcoin spot ETF, they've placed it at around 65% at this point. So that's much better than it was before BlackRock filed for the product.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, you figure if BlackRock can't make it, what chance does some of these smaller companies have indeed? But thank you for getting us up to speed. And we will be taking a look at those enforcement actions as well. Our very own David Hollerith. Thanks so much."

        "title": "Bitcoin recovers after falling below $26,000 as the ETF excitement bubble bursts - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin stabilized Tuesday morning in Asia after dropping below the key US$26,000 support level overnight. Ether also dipped but held the US$1,600 mark. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower, with Polygon\u2019s Matic leading the losers. Alternative asset manager CoinShares reported a US$55 million outflow in digital asset investment products last week. Analysts say disappointment from the stalemate on U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications has impacted sentiment. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index continued its downward slide in the wake of NFT marketplace OpenSea\u2019s decision to stop enforcing creator royalties. U.S. stock futures traded lower after Wall Street closed mixed on Monday.\n\nETF logjam and low liquidity damaging sentiment\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.10% in the last 24 hours to US$26,133.35 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, expanding its weekly loss of 11.12%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency dropped to a low of US$25,846.09 just after midnight, but rallied to reclaim US$26,000 as the night progressed.\n\n\u201cAs the beginning of the week turned positive for traditional markets, crypto markets seem to \u2014 for now \u2014 be back in stagnation mode,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cMany investors were understandably spooked by last week\u2019s rapid rise in volatility and the subsequent price fall, which now means that a positive mood will only be just enough to keep crypto markets where they are.\u201d\n\nFor some analysts, last week\u2019s rapid decline in the price of Bitcoin is a correction for price increases since June caused by ETF hype in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe recent turmoil led BTC price to trading levels that mirror the ones preceding the Blackrock filing for their BTC Spot ETF,\u201d Matteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in an emailed note.\n\n\u201cThe fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) which lasted a few weeks after the filing seems to be now disappeared, waiting for news on the matter,\u201d Greco added.\n\nStory continues\n\nLow liquidity in the crypto market also contributed to last week\u2019s slide. Limited trading volume is driving market makers \u2014 which typically absorb sudden fluctuations in supply and demand and help provide a more predictable trading environment \u2014 to wind down their activities and wait for a better time to fully resume operations.\n\nGSR Markets, described by Greco as \u201cone of the most important market makers,\u201d has recently gone through two rounds of layoffs in response to worsening market conditions. Greco pointed out that before GSR, influential market makers Jane Street and Jump took similar actions citing difficulties with the state of the market.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether dropped 0.84% to US$1,667.73 and moved down 9.55% for the past seven days.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower over the past 24 hours. Polygon\u2019s Matic token led the losers. It dropped 3.53% to US$0.5589 for a weekly loss of 17.81%.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw an outflow of US$55 million in the week ending August 18. That followed a US$29 million inflow the previous week, according to a CoinShares report released Monday.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is in reaction to recent media highlighting that a decision by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission in allowing a U.S. spot-based ETF is not imminent,\u201d the company wrote in the report.\n\nBitcoin-linked investment products saw the majority of last week\u2019s outflow, totaling US$42 million. Ethereum, Polygon, Litecoin and Polkadot also recorded outflows, while XRP-linked inflows totaled US$1.2 million.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.62% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume rose 35.31% to US$29.31 billion.\n\nNFT marketplace Recur to shut down\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.41% in the past 24 hours to 2,319.54 as of 10:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, falling 6.69% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum Solana and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the Polygon index moved higher.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects a tremendous loss of value this year which has accelerated this week following OpenSea\u2019s announcement that they\u2019re moving away from forced royalties,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, announced last week it will stop enforcing creator royalty fees from August 31, but will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.\n\n\u201cYuga Labs, Animoca, and even Mark Cuban came out with statements calling the move a mistake for the digital economy and creators. Sentiment may be at a low point this year now and as one might expect, prices are tumbling,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nThe average NFT sales price in the week ending August 20 dropped to US$26.26, the lowest since August 2020 and down over 78% from the start of the year, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cNow the flipside is that NFT transactions hit an all time high last week,\u201d said Petscher. Participation matters a lot to me, and seeing 3,702,180 transactions tells me NFTs have reached a new height.\u201d\n\nAmid rising transactions and sliding prices, sellers posted about US$9.5 million in losses last week, CryptoSlam data shows.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume edged up 0.49% in the past 24 hours to US$13.60 million. Volumes on the Ethereum, BNB Chain and Cardano blockchains logged increases, while the Solana, Polygon and Bitcoin volumes dropped.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. It rose 60.15% to over US$2.04 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Ethereum-based Mutant Ape Yacht Club ranked as the second and third largest collections by 24-hour trading volume.\n\nElsewhere, NFT marketplace Recur announced on Saturday it would gradually shut down by November 16.\n\nToday, with heavy hearts, we must share some difficult news.\n\n\n\nAfter much contemplation and consideration, we\u2019ve decided to deprecate the RECUR platform, effective November 16, 2023.\n\n\n\nLearn more: https://t.co/5NbiTQSAGo \u2014 RECUR (@RecurForever) August 18, 2023\n\nThe decision came less than two years after a US$50 million funding round investment raised the platform\u2019s valuation to US$333 million.\n\n\u201cUnforeseen challenges and shifts in the business landscape have made it increasingly difficult for us to continue providing the level of service and dedication that we have always strived to maintain,\u201d said Recur in a Twitter thread on Saturday.\n\nAll eyes on Nvidia\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading lower as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. The three major U.S. indexes closed mixed at the end of regular session trading Monday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logging gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average booked losses.\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia were mixed on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index dipped, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei logged gains.\n\nAI chipmaker Nvidia spearheaded a rally in the technology sector on Monday. The U.S. tech giant posted gains of 8.5% after HSBC raised its price target for the U.S. firm\u2019s stock to US$780, the second highest on Wall Street.\n\nNvidia \u2014 whose share price has surged three times higher since the start of the year on the back of booming interest in artificial intelligence \u2014 will release its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been covering tech since 1994 and I have never seen an environment where you are so dependent on one company to deliver,\u201d Inge Heydorn, partner at investment firm GP Bullhound, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cAI is really the last pillar of growth and everybody is depending on it. If Nvidia shows weakness, we could be in for quite a substantial correction in the market,\u201d Bullhound added.\n\nMeanwhile, investors await U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed-held annual summit will be attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell\u2019s speech could provide insights into the Fed\u2019s thinking on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cThe Fed and investors will soon pivot from a focus on how high the policy rate will go to a concern about how long they will stay at that level \u2014 and what the implications are for a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 scenario,\u201d Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at financial services firm Northern Trust, told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIn our view, Powell will want to stay on message, and will try to push back against a growing market consensus that rate cuts are on the 2024 horizon,\u201d said Nixon.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate currently sits between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 15.5% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, up from 11.5% on Monday.\n\nIn China, investors are assessing Beijing\u2019s latest round of policy stimulus. Analysts suspect Monday\u2019s smaller-than-expected interest rate cut by the central bank may not be enough to stop a slide toward recession.\n\n\u201cThe small injection of stimulus by China\u2019s central bank in the ailing economy has proved largely underwhelming given the scale of the challenges erupting across sectors, but it has given investors hope there could be more to come,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at U.K.-based financial service firm Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"
