        "title": "This Bitcoin-themed bar in Mexico City is a hub for the crypto community. - Slate",
        "content": "It\u2019s 7 p.m. on a Thursday, and I\u2019m drinking a beer next to a Bitcoin ATM.\n\nOn the wall in front of me is an illustration of a masked Satoshi Nakamoto: \u201cDon\u2019t Delay\u2014Be Your Own Bank,\u201d it announces. It\u2019s one of several portraits of Satoshi, including one that features him taking off from a dollar bill as if he were a superhero. (The portraits are particularly creative, since no one knows who Satoshi\u2014a pseudonym\u2014really is.) A TV is mounted above the bar, displaying the current values of hundreds of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin occupies the biggest space on the screen, followed by Ethereum and Binance Coin, and then other coins, many with squares so tiny that they\u2019re imperceptible. The numbers on the screen fluctuate steadily: A Bitcoin is worth $21,163.64, then $21,112.75, then $21,101.05. Behind me is a case full of Bitcoin memorabilia for sale: mugs, T-shirts, rings.\n\nThis is Bitcoin Embassy Bar, a hip two-story establishment in Mexico City\u2019s Roma Norte neighborhood. It\u2019s a place where you can use Bitcoin to pay for a hot doge (Doge Coind, Multidoge, or Dogechain, depending on your liking), or exchange pesos to reload your Bitcoin wallet. It also hopes to be a gathering place for the Bitcoin community in Latin America. As it does so, it weaves a sort of tension: creating a physical gathering space for a community that is, in its DNA, digital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatin America is arguably the most important testing ground for building physical infrastructure and community around digital currencies\u2014from El Salvador to Puerto Rico to Guatemala. Depending on how you feel about crypto, this is either incredibly exciting or incredibly problematic. According to a report by Americas Society/Council of the Americas, the use of cryptocurrencies in Latin America rose 1,370 percent between 2019 and 2021. Mainstream adoption is still quite far away, but crypto proponents make big promises in the region: that a new, decentralized financial system could promote financial inclusion, combat corruption, and serve as a counterweight to hyperinflation. Still, those promises are hard to deliver on\u2014and, as in the case of El Salvador, those who pay the real price of failure are rarely the people with red lasers shooting out of their eyes on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLorena Ortiz, the cofounder and owner of Bitcoin Embassy Bar, first started investing in Bitcoin in 2017. She needed quick money for a trip to Japan\u2014her friend was producing a tour and invited her to go along. \u201cIt made total sense to me to have a tool that could help people break free of the failed system we live with,\u201d Ortiz, 33, said. Bitcoin was punk, and so was she. Around November, she started with a small investment of about $25 USD. In December, Bitcoin hit an all-time high. But Ortiz decided to forgo the trip to dedicate herself to her newfound crypto passion.*\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, Ortiz started talking with the bar\u2019s cofounder, David Noriega, about the need for a physical gathering space for Bitcoiners in Mexico City. Noriega brought the technical Bitcoin experience, and Ortiz knew how to run a restaurant. The bar opened its doors in December of that year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Ortiz told me, the business has grown mostly through word-of-mouth. There are ups and downs: During bull markets, she said, the yet unconverted often wander in with questions about Bitcoin. During bear markets, most of Ortiz\u2019s customers are more dedicated Bitcoiners, who attend frequent meet-ups and share tips. Shortly after our interview, the bar\u2019s second floor welcomed 20 or so Bitcoiners for one such meet-up about myths in Bitcoin, led by a Colombian crypto influencer. During meet-ups, up to 50 percent of customers pay the tab in Bitcoin, Ortiz said, but that drops down to 10 or 20 percent when there isn\u2019t an event. Plastered around the bar are print-outs with tips to avoid crypto scams\u2014and this, Ortiz tells me, is one of her core goals: to create a space where people can learn and ask questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin Embassy Bar isn\u2019t the first business of its kind: There\u2019s a coffee shop in Prague, a bar in Manhattan, and a burger joint in L.A. that follow similar models. This makes sense, because for its core believers, Bitcoin is \u201cnot an investment but an ideology,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s worth remembering that the community that\u2019s formed around said ideology includes many documented cases of misogyny, racism, harassment, extremism, antisemitism, conspiracy, and outright scams. The crypto community is often hostile to outsiders or critics, and online crypto discourse is known for its toxicity\u2014it\u2019s hard to imagine \u201ccrypto bro\u201d culture is a culture worth replicating. But while it\u2019s important to acknowledge the more pernicious elements of this ecosystem, it\u2019s also not necessarily fair to use the loudest, most problematic voices to generalize about such a large group of people. A recent Pew survey found that 16 percent of U.S. adults have invested in, traded, or used a cryptocurrency. And among this community, gathering spaces and meet-ups are foundational. \u201cAll revolutions, all social movements, all of these kinds of systemic disruptions wouldn\u2019t have been possible if a small minority hadn\u2019t started to grow, grow, grow through community,\u201d Ortiz told me. In Latin America, she continued, \u201cwe have a deeply rooted tradition of making community \u2026 in person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMexico\u2019s crypto ecosystem has grown since the bar opened\u2014four years in Bitcoin is equivalent to 20 normal years, Ortiz says. In May 2021, Mexico-based Bitso, a cryptocurrency exchange, became Latin America\u2019s first cryptocurrency unicorn, and in December of that year, the department store Elektra announced it would accept Bitcoin for online sales. Billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the (very!) controversial chairman of Grupo Elektra, is probably the country\u2019s most influential Bitcoin proponent\u2014in June 2021, he announced that Banco Azteca, which he also leads, would endeavor to become the first Mexican bank to accept Bitcoin. (Mexican regulators quickly shot this suggestion down.) In 2022, Salinas Pliego announced that 60 percent of his liquid portfolio was in Bitcoin or Bitcoin equities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSalinas Pliego was a topic of conversation at the first meet-up I attended at Bitcoin Embassy Bar, which featured a lawyer, a consultant, and an economics professor debating whether Bitcoin could\u2014and should\u2014be regulated. Salinas Pliego has a longstanding relationship with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and an attendee wanted to know whether he might be able to convert the president into a Bitcoiner. (The consensus: no.)\n\nThat night\u2019s conversation lasted about an hour and a half, during which the attendees collectively rolled their eyes at Sam Bankman-Fried for dirtying crypto\u2019s reputation and used their iPhones to flip between Instagram, Twitter, and Bitcoin wallets. A Brit who recently moved to Mexico tried to get me to open a Bitcoin wallet right then and there (I don\u2019t own crypto), and a Mexican who worked at a crypto start-up asked what I, as a newcomer, thought were the biggest advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin. Someone at the table next to me, I noticed, had a Sharpie rendering of the Bitcoin logo drawn on their thumbnail. The wall in front of us held a neon sign that read Eat Sleep Crypto Repeat and a large chalkboard with an illustration of an alien ship, complete with the caption We\u2019re going to the moon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the moon, it turns out, is still pretty far away. As I reported this story, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about a tweet Ortiz posted in early January: One of the city pipes connected to the restaurant was broken, and the restaurant, as a result, was having problems with leaking wastewater. They hadn\u2019t been able to get local authorities to do anything for the past month, and were hoping their followers could help up the pressure on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis struck me as the perfect representation of what it\u2019s like to run a Bitcoin bar: You can spend all the time you want talking about a decentralized, digital, financially autonomous future. But at the end of the day, you\u2019re still stuck with clunky government bureaucracy and sewer water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked Ortiz about this, she laughed. It\u2019s a familiar sensation: Every time she goes to the bank, has to knock on the door of government officials, or juggles headaches like the drainage issue, \u201cIt\u2019s like coming back to Earth: \u2018Hey, Lore, don\u2019t fly away. This is your reality,\u2019 \u201d she told me. She treats it as a lesson. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, you have to know where you\u2019re standing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some stories from the recent past of Future Tense.\n\nFuture Tense Fiction\n\nJanuary\u2019s story was \u201cBigfeet\u201d by Future Tense editor Torie Bosch. Written as if it were a New Yorker-esque article, Bosch\u2019s brilliant fiction debut chronicles a billionaire\u2019s revenge-driven quest to \u201cde-extinct\u201d a bigfoot-like creature. The story is largely told from the perspective of Dr. Shelley, one of the researchers who, sequestered on a distant island, helped combine ape, cow, and bear DNA to create Bigfeet: docile, bipedal creatures that look like \u201ca bizarro A.I. rendering of the traditional Bigfoot,\u201d complete with purple tongues. In a response essay, conservation researcher Challie Facemire discusses the unforeseen consequences of introducing species where they don\u2019t belong.\n\nWish We\u2019d Published This\n\n\u201cWhy My Bittersweet Relationship With Shein Had to End,\u201d by Zeyi Yang, MIT Technology Review\n\nFuture Tense Recommends\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving found myself in a bit of a streaming rut last month, I finally heeded the recommendations to watch Bad Sisters on Apple TV+. The 10-episode first season premiered in August, and the show was recently renewed for a second season. It follows the five Garvey sisters\u2014Eva, Becka, Bibi, Ursula, and Grace\u2014and begins by showing the body of John Paul, Grace\u2019s husband, in a coffin. We quickly learn that Eva, Becka, Bibi, and Ursula were trying to kill John Paul, who is presented as controlling, manipulative, and emotionally abusive (for starters \u2026 he eventually gets much worse). The show weaves past and present story lines\u2014the events leading up to John Paul\u2019s death, and the fallout from the same\u2014and guides us through stunning Irish landscapes, which, along with the show\u2019s dark-but-smart humor, serve a sort of numbing function for the heavy topics embedded in the plot. Reviewers have pointed out that the show simplifies many of these topics and flattens naturally complex characters, and I think that\u2019s true\u2014we walk away with little understanding of John Paul as anything other than a caricature of misogyny, for example. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s just really entertaining television.\n\nWhat Next: TBD\n\nOn Friday\u2019s episode of Slate\u2019s technology podcast, host Lizzie O\u2019Leary interviewed Tim Requarth, a Slate contributing writer, about how COVID really affects our immune systems. Last week, Lizzie talked to the Washington Post\u2019s Will Oremus about what the rise of A.I. tools like ChatGPT mean for consumers. She also chatted with Bloomberg\u2019s Leah Nylen about why the Department of Justice thinks Google\u2019s ad-tech business needs breaking up, and whether that\u2019s actually likely to happen. And on Sunday, Lizzie will be joined by Ron Lieber of the New York Times to discuss why JPMorgan says it was conned by a young founder who promised to help students get financial aid\u2014and what made her story so magnetic in the first place.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 7, 2023: This piece originally misstated that Lorena Ortiz went on a trip to Japan after Bitcoin hit an all-time high. She decided to forgo the trip to focus on Bitcoin.\n\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society."

CSGORoll: this website first opened in 206 but was forced to close for a period because of Steam\u2019s CSGO skins policy. Back in 2020 it reopened and is not flourishing with players and bonuses. In fact, new players receive a good bonus offer that makes the quick registration process worthwhile. Furthermore, you will get free daily bonuses, which means that coming back to gamble on a daily basis is a good deal.\n\nCrash Gambling \u2013 What Are the Rules\n\nThis game is loosely based on the concept of trading and caters to players that enjoy that kind of thing. The action involves a graph with a line that constantly goes up. While this occurs the odds for withdrawing go up and you can cash out at any point. However, eventually the game will crash and players that have not cashed out before this happens will lose the wager.\n\nTherefore, it is a risk and reward gameplay mechanic. To win money players need to be patient and wait for the odds to increase so the winnings are higher. However, if they get too greedy, then the entire wager will be lost due to the game crashing.\n\nAt the time of writing, crash is not one of the easiest gaming options to find online because the top software providers have not developed it. For example, you will not find it available from industry-leading software companies like Microgaming and NetEnt.\n\nWhat Are the Game Odds\n\nThe game odds are usually set on the casino or website where you are playing. Therefore, they can be different and you need to adjust your strategy. Ideally, you will find a website that offers the best gambling odds by reducing the house edge.\n\nKeep in mind that many crash games have a mechanic of around 1% chance to instantly crash when the game starts. This means that no matter what you do, there is no chance of winning money for that round.\n\nNote that the odds on the betting line start small and increase rapidly over time. You will start at 1x and potentially end up at 10x, which means that you can cash out for 10 times the wager amount.\n\nWhat Are Crash Game Payouts Like\n\nThis section covers topics that relate to the payouts and multipliers within the game. Note that these are just a rule of thumb. The actual details of the action will be different for each caisno where you are playing. Therefore, make sure to read the terms and conditions to ensure you have the relevant information.\n\nGame rules: the game starts when you wager an amount of money. The amount that you can bet will be based on where you are playing. There might be a minimum and a maximum amount that you can wager. Once you have placed a bet the action starts and the point on the betting line goes up. This increases the odds and the game ends when you cash out or the game crashes, and you lose the entire wager.\n\nThe multiplier: these are the chances of cash out odds as the game changes. So the action starts at 1x and it may increase to a 2x multiplier incrementally or it will jump there in one go. Each casino creates different multipliers so you will need to play to figure out what you will face. Note that the idea is to get the highest multiplier to win the most cash possible.\n\nThe minimum and the maximum crash point: this is the range of multipliers where the game can crash. The house edge typically works by creating a crash point immediately after the game starts. The maximum crash point is the higher possible multiplier for the game. You can risk your wager by waiting for the betting line to reach this number, but there is a high chance of the game going bust before that happens.\n\nThe minimum cash out: this refers to the smallest multiplier that you can hit to get your wager back and winnings. Most games provide a minimum cash out point that is around 2x, which means you will get double your wager. However, this is not set in stone and will be different at each casino. You could use a strategy where you always try to hit the minimum cash out to keep the risk low.\n\nCrash Betting Games Based on Currency\n\nThis section shares the various currencies that can be used when enjoying this game. You will see that the game can be played in a variety of ways to suit your needs. Being aware of the options allows you to get the most out of the experience.\n\nCS:GO Crash Gambling\n\nSkins: one of the best ways to show off in CSGO is by sharing a rare skin. These are essentially cosmetics that change the look of your character. The rarity of skins varies from common all the way to rare. You can win skins from the crash game and the rarity of the skin increases as you increase the risks by waiting for the betting line to increase.\n\nCases: the cases in CSGO have a weapon inside them that are locked. Opening a case provides a new weapon, that also have different rarities. They are usually dropped in game as a random item or you can win them from mission rewards. However, they are also used as the payout option in crash gambling. This means you can win cool new weapons using this method, which might be faster than grinding for them in-game.\n\nLoot boxes: as the name suggests, these items are boxes that when opened provide some loot. The item that is received is random and the chance of getting something rare is low. The odds that you have for getting each item in a loot pool are shared online since this is required by law for transparency reasons. You can win loot boxes by playing crash and the number of loot boxes that you receive increases with the multiplier.\n\nCrypto Crash Gambling\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC): these are arguably 2 of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the planet. Many casinos where crash bitcoin game is available provide cryptocurrency as a means of gambling. It\u2019s a good option because you can deposit funds anonymously and withdraw them the same way. However, the price of these cryptocurrencies fluctuates daily so you need to be aware of this when figuring out your gambling strategy.\n\nEthereum (ETH): this cryptocurrency take around 7.5 days to mine and you can use it to gamble on crash. For example, one casino allows you to fuel a rocket with Ether, which makes it increase on the betting line. However, at any moment it can crash and that will result in a loss of all the Ether that was used to fuel the rocket.\n\nEOS/USDT: this refers to cryptocurrencies on the Binance blockchain. They can also be used to wager on crash gambling, which provides holders of these coins to get involved. However, this is not as widely available as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, you need to check with the casino where you are applying to ensure that it is an option open to players.\n\nCoin Crash Gambling Canada\n\nYou can also gamble with FIAT money using popular currencies like Euros, USD and British Pound Sterling. These currencies are available at many casinos where you can use to deposit and withdraw with several methods.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that some casinos only support crypto-based currencies. This means that currencies like USD or EUR cannot be used for depositing to the cashier and betting. This might be because the financial infrastructure for supporting crypto and FIAT currencies are different.\n\nWhat Crash Gambling Game Should You Choose\n\nWith so many varieties of the game you need to decide on what version to play. First, choose a currency that matches your available funds. For example, if you hold crypto then choose a coin that you have and are familiar with.
