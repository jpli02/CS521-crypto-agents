        "content": "You were right. It\u2019s not a passing fad.\n\nFor all of the legal trouble that entrepreneurs like Sam Bankman-Fried are in and the regulatory mess that companies like Binance find themselves in, people keep buying cryptocurrency.\n\nEven as the price of Bitcoin fell precipitously in 2022, the percentage of people in the United States owning crypto grew to 11 percent from 3 percent in just a year. It\u2019s at 12 percent this year, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, and Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen more than 75 percent from its 2022 low.\n\nCrypto conviction \u2014 or just curiosity \u2014 is not something that merits condescension from the olds and scolds of personal finance. It just requires you to ask a few questions about who you are and why you find crypto alluring.\n\nIt is true that younger adults are more open to this way of putting money to work. If you\u2019re under 40, you\u2019re more likely to own crypto than people over 60, according to the N.B.E.R. research. You\u2019re also more likely to be male."

        "title": "Michael Saylor's Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Bet Has Rebounded - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nMichael Saylor, MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and executive chairman, has seen his bold bet on bitcoin vindicated as BTC\u2019s price has risen dramatically since his resignation as CEO.\n\nA longtime Bitcoin advocate, Saylor began publicly purchasing large amounts of bitcoin in 2020, devoting MicroStrategy\u2019s resources to several high-profile acquisitions that built up a reserve of nearly $2 billion worth by 2022. Although he began these purchases with the bitcoin price at around $10,000, the price had reached more than $30,000 by August 2022, roughly where the price sits at the time of this writing. Many of the firm\u2019s largest purchases were at the higher end of this premium, and Saylor resigned from his position as CEO that same month as MicroStrategy reported a $1 billion loss related to a bitcoin price slump.\n\nAfter Saylor\u2019s resignation, poor performance from bitcoin turned worse as the cryptocurrency exchange FTX cratered in spectacular fashion in November 2022. Through the rest of the year, the bitcoin price remained at around half of what it was when Saylor and MicroStrategy made many of its purchases. However, rising from these lows, the cryptocurrency rose dramatically and consistently throughout 2023 until seeming to generally recover from this valley.\n\nOne year on from his departure from leading MicroStrategy, it seems that Saylor\u2019s persistence is bearing fruit. Although he resigned from his position as CEO, responsible for day-to-day management and operations of his company, he did retain a role as executive chairman of its board, leading the company\u2019s shareholders and representing the firm publicly. With a focus on continuing the firm\u2019s bitcoin strategy, Saylor continued buying thousands of bitcoin at reduced prices, and his commitment seems to be paying off.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Saylor noted MicroStrategy\u2019s 254% increase in stock price since the beginning of his strategy, comparing it to the stock prices of firms like Google and Apple, which rose 78% and 74%, respectively. The decision to publicly tie MicroStrategy\u2019s fortune to bitcoin has, at least for now, led to gains unrelated to the firm\u2019s core products and offerings. This month, the company revealed a plan to sell $750 million of its stock, ostensibly to make further large purchases of bitcoin, and its value rose when the news broke.\n\nSaylor\u2019s work with Bitcoin has gone beyond this high-profile advocacy, as he has taken to development work on the Lightning Network in the past year as well. More than anything, these displays of conviction have shown that his commitment to Bitcoin\u2019s economic vision are genuine, rather than based merely on the dollar price at any given time.\n\nThis decision to wholeheartedly back Bitcoin has seemingly turned into a durable business strategy, capable of weathering and surmounting significant tempests in the global economy.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether dip amid low volatility; Solana gains - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat on Tuesday afternoon in Asia to stay range bound above the US$29,000 support level. Ether dipped, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower, with Solana\u2019s SOL the only one strengthening. The Forkast 500 NFT index moved up after the NFT market saw the largest weekly total transactions since February 2022. Most Asian stock markets dropped after China unexpectedly lowered its interest rate on Tuesday morning and released weaker-than-expected economic data. U.S. stock futures also declined and European bourses traded lower.\n\nBitcoin, Ether flat; Solana rises\n\nBitcoin remained unchanged in the last 24 hours to trade at US$29,380.78 as of 5 p.m. in Hong Kong, and logged a weekly gain of 0.82%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly reached a high of US$29,660.25 early Tuesday morning.\n\nBitcoin prices are below its 50-day moving average of US$29,887, with its 30-day realized volatility falling to 17%, the lowest since November 2018, which both indicate bearishness in the token, Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed note on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cGreed & Fear Index prints 54% for Bitcoin, above the 21-day moving average which signals that a rally could occur imminently,\u201d added Thielen.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has remained largely within at US$29,000-30,600 for the past seven weeks, causing frustration among investors seeking higher rewards. However, low volatility could prove to be a blessing in disguise, said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThis newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cThis stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,\u201d he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nDigital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending Aug. 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Bitcoin saw an inflow of US$27 million \u2014 roughly 93% of the total inflows.\n\nThe inflows to digital asset investment products are \u201clikely due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,\u201d CoinShares wrote in the report.\n\nEther dipped 0.33% to US$1,840.95 but added 0.71% for the past seven days. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded lower with the exception of Solana\u2019s SOL, which moved up 1.39% to US$24.82 and gained 7.09% for the week.\n\nSynthesis One, an artificial intelligence (AI) data crowdsourcing platform based on the Solana blockchain, launched its new train-to-earn application \u201cWorkspace by Synesis\u201d on Monday.\n\nThe app allows users to train AIs as data providers while earning cryptocurrencies as rewards. This process, Synthesis One claims, will result in a \u201cfully traceable and auditable\u201d data supply chain.\n\nShiba Inu, which has recently replaced Polkadot as the 10th biggest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market cap, led the losers, falling 2.89% to US$0.00001028 while logging a weekly jump of 14.51%\n\nThe token received a boost from the incoming launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 network built by Shiba Inu developers whose launch date is yet to be unveiled.\n\nBlockchain analytics platform Lookonchain noted Tuesday that bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital had been selling its assets including Shiba Inu, which could weaken the upward trend in the token.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.18% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume edged up 7.75% to US$26.17 billion.\n\nWeekly NFT transactions rise to year-high\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index moved up 0.27% in the past 24 hours to 2,482.04 as of 17:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, and up 0.05% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano NFT indexes also logged gains, while the index for Solana dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 28.04% in the past 24 hours to over US$17.71 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all logged double-digit gains, while volumes on the Bitcoin blockchain shrank.\n\nIn the week ending Aug. 13, NFT sales topped US$101 million after sitting short of US$100 million for three consecutive weeks. NFT transactions for the week exceeded 2.8 million, a high since February 2022.\n\nOn the past week\u2019s surge in NFT sales, Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, said that he saw the emergence of low-priced collections as key to a sustained potential uptick in the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a glimpse of the future of NFTs. More affordable prices, higher volume, likely big brands and this is what we\u2019re seeing in DraftKings, DMarket, Gods Unchained, and Sorare,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nCombined, Petscher noted, those three collections alone notched 872,185 transactions \u2014 nearly a third of the week\u2019s total transactions.\n\n\u201cThe question is, is this sustainable? I think it is, and that\u2019s exactly why this will be the future. Traders haven\u2019t really left NFT, they just ran out of liquidity since there\u2019s no profits. But they can afford NFTs that are priced at just a few dollars,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based DeGods saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, surging 255.38% to over US$2.92 million after the project launched its \u201cSeason 3\u201d digital art collection on Sunday.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mythos Chain-based DMarket, ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained and Polygon-based DraftKings took up the rest of the top five NFT collections in terms of 24-hour sales volume.\n\nAdidas Originals, a subdivision of sports apparel corporation Adidas, will launch its first NFT auction on Aug. 22 in collaboration with crypto payment platform Moonpay.\n\nThe auction will feature 100 \u201cproduct-linked\u201d NFTs, each of which can be later redeemed for a pair of limited-edition sneakers in the real world as well as a digital replica.\n\nMost Asia stock markets drop, U.S. equities down\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures slid as of 18:30 p.m. in Hong Kong following gains at the close of trading Monday, while the main stock indexes traded mixed. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all logged losses, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved higher.The stock market took a blow after China\u2019s central bank unexpectedly lowered the rate of its medium-term lending facility (MLF) by 15 basis points to 2.5% on Tuesday morning, only two months after the previous rate cut in June.\n\n\u201cThe slightly earlier timing and a larger than expected 15 basis point rate cut of MLF show that Beijing feels the urgency to take more policy easing actions to stabilize expectations and growth,\u201d Xiaojia Zhi, chief China economist at international banking group Credit Agricole, told Bloomberg, adding that China could see more monetary easing in the coming months.\n\n\u201c(The rate cut in China) is a positive but I suspect the support to the market from this will be subdued and short-lived,\u201d Redmond Wong, a market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Hong Kong, told Bloomberg in another Tuesday report. \u201cInvestors now are worried about credit events, not just from the ailing property sector.\u201d\n\nThe decision was announced shortly before China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics reported disappointing economic data for July. That data included a rise in the urban unemployment rate, as well as decelerated and smaller-than-expected growth in retail sales and industrial production, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nU.S. global investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a Sunday note it expected the Federal Reserve to start cutting the interest rates in the second quarter of 2024 and keep the rates unchanged at its next meeting in September, Bloomberg reported on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inflation is closer to target,\u201d wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in the Sunday note.\n\nU.S. investors now await the release of retail sales data on Tuesday, followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes on Wednesday, for further insight on the health of the U.S. economy and the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level since January 2001. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 88.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September.\n\nElsewhere, European bourses traded lower on Tuesday, with the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 both dropping during afternoon hours in Asia.\n\nStocks in U.K. and Sweden spearheaded the drop in the European markets, as a strong wage increase in the U.K. and high inflation data in Sweden triggered fears of more interest rate hikes, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"
