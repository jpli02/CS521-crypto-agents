        "title": "An Introduction to Bitcoin Ordinals - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Ordinals. Inscriptions. If you\u2019re a crypto newbie, these terms may seem foreign to you. If you\u2019ve been in crypto for long, it is also unlikely you know these terms. Yet, Ordinals have been all the rage this past month. So, what exactly are these? Today, we provide an introduction to Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nTo do so, we\u2019ll be summarizing an interview by Stephan Livera as shown below. Said interview is with Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals.\n\nWho Is Casey Rodarmor?\n\nThe interview starts off with Casey summarizing his own background. In short, he is a long-time Bitcoiner and software engineer. In his early days, he worked for big tech companies like Google and Meta. After discovering crypto, his accomplishments include:\n\nHelping Chaincode Labs as a Bitcoin core developer.\n\nCreating Agora. Agora allows users to sell files for $BTC lightning payments.\n\nHosting the San Francisco Bitcoin Developer\u2019s meetup.\n\nTo date, his biggest achievement would be the creation of Ordinals. He began working on it since early 2022. Moving forward to August 2022, he created ORD. ORD comprises a wallet and block explorer, which you can access here. On 21 January 2023, Ordinals launches and immediately gains a large user base.\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nNext, Casey moves on to explain what Ordinals and Inscriptions are. In a nutshell, this is a dual-layer project. Ordinals make up the base layer, and Inscriptions make up the top layer. With this, users can create and store digital NFTs directly on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\n1) Ordinals\n\nOrdinals is arbitrary data stored in one satoshi (sat) on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. A sat is a small fraction of a Bitcoin. To recap, 1 $BTC equals to 100,000,000 sats. Moreover, users can send/receive ordinals.\n\nAs Casey explains in his exact words, \u201cOrdinals are a convention which anyone can opt into\u201d. He states that it is \u201cjust a convention that does not exist on the Bitcoin layer\u201d. With it, \u201cyou can do things like see a sat\u2019s particular history, make sats rare and exotic, give sats names and other wacky stuff.\u201d Again, he reiterates that \u201cit\u2019s just this thing that you can convention that you can view the blockchain and pretend that individual sats have an identity and individual sats can move from UTXO to UTXO.\u201d\n\nSo, how do we modify sats? This brings us to the next layer \u2013 Inscriptions.\n\nInscriptions\n\nInscriptions refer to the addition of data to each Sat, to make it an Ordinal. Said data can be in various forms, such as:\n\nText.\n\nAudio.\n\nVideo.\n\nAudio.\n\nIn Casey\u2019s own words, inscriptions are \u201canother convention which allows you to stick content (any file returnable by a file server, or any content viewable by a browser). Content is assigned to one of the SATs in the output of the transaction.\u201d. With this, \u201cthis turns the sats effectively into a \u201cDigital Artifact\u201d.\n\nNow, you can see that each Sat has the potential to exist as an NFT. Or a Digital Artifact, as Casey puts it. Each Ordinal is also immutable and secure. This is similar in nature to Ethereum\u2019s NFTs.\n\nPros and Cons of Ordinals\n\nMoving on, Stephan and Casey went on to discuss the pros and cons of Ordinals. Starting with the bull case, Casey states the benefits of Ordinals:\n\nRepresenting art, culture and money. Casey explains that old forms of money were intertwined with art and culture. In the olden days, money was in the forms of carved beads and art. Ordinal inscriptions are its modern representation.\n\nCasey explains that old forms of money were intertwined with art and culture.

He believes that Ordinals provide the right product-market fit.\n\nCasey brings up the immense popularity of NFTs. He believes that Ordinals provide the right product-market fit. Onboarding users to the Bitcoin network. Casey opines that Ordinals can attract more users to use Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a flip side as well. During the interview, Stephan brings up a few cons for Ordinals.\n\nFirstly, he says that Ordinals could make validating harder. Bitcoin nodes have to download more data in order to validate the blockchain. Casey acknowledges this concern. Secondly, Stephan brings up a concern if Ordinals gaining traction. More users on the Bitcoin network would equate to higher fees. Again, this is a valid point.\n\nThe Potential of Ordinals\n\nDespite the cons above, Casey provides a simple reply. NFTs are meant to be fun! Every person views NFTs differently. Some value it while others think that it\u2019s garbage. Truth of the matter is: There is a thriving market for it. So, the Bitcoin network should improve to cater to increased volume instead. It makes no sense to stifle innovation just to keep Bitcoin fees low.\n\nThe discussion then segues into the consumption of blockspace. Now, what does this mean? Let\u2019s find out more.\n\nConsumption of Blockspace\n\nCasey makes it clear that Ordinals are more secure compared to Ethereum\u2019s NFTs. This is because Ordinals exist fully on-chain. Remember what we went through earlier? Data is inscribed directly onto a Sat. With that, an Ordinal is as secure as a Bitcoin.\n\nThis is in contrast to Ethereum\u2019s NFTs. On Ethereum, NFT metadata could be stored off-chain. It could be stored on third party systems. For instance, an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or external servers. If such third parties go offline, you could lose access to your NFT.\n\nBitcoin is the most badass, resilient, immutable database on planet earth. Ordinal inscriptions are how you write files to that database. Stop asking \"why ordinals?\" if your pfp is stored in the AWS data center in Columbus, Ohio. \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) February 23, 2023\n\nWith Ethereum, NFTs also face smart contract risks. Your NFT could be lost if its smart contract is buggy or malicious. Bitcoin Ordinals and Inscriptions address both of these risks Ethereum NFTs face. Hence, an increase in blockspace consumption here does have its own benefits too!\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all, the interview was very informative. The discussion skews toward the technical side at times. Even so, it provides a great overview of Casey\u2019s project.\n\nWhat I do agree with Casey on is: Bitcoin Ordinals are here to stay. Whether you like it or not. Indeed, it\u2019s a new use-case for Bitcoin. We should embrace such new innovations, rather than fight it.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency markets and the United States equities markets witnessed profit-booking this week as the macroeconomic data hinted toward continued rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin (BTC) is down more than 4% and the S&P 500 fell 2.7% to record its worst week of the year.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool shows a 73% probability of a 25 basis points rate hike by the Fed in the March meeting but after the hotter-than-expected inflation readings in two weeks, the probability of a 50 basis point rate hike has started to slowly gain traction.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nDuring periods of uncertainty, some coins enter a deeper correction while a few buck the trend and continue to outperform. Hence, it becomes important to select the right coins to trade.\n\nA few coins that have witnessed a shallow correction or have bounced sharply off the support have been selected in this list. Let\u2019s see their charts and determine the levels to watch out for.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin plunged below the 20-day exponential moving average ($23,391) on Feb. 24 but the bears could not build upon this advantage and sustain the price below the strong support at $22,800.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price bounced off $22,800 on Feb. 25 and the bulls are trying to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, it will indicate that the BTC/USDT pair may consolidate between $25,250 and $22,800 for a few days.\n\nThe flattening 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint also suggest a range-bound action in the near term.\n\nAlternatively, if the price slips below $22,700, the selling could intensify and the pair may plummet to the next strong support at $21,480.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA has turned down on the four-hour chart and the RSI is in the negative territory. This indicates an advantage to the bears. Sellers will try to protect the 20-EMA, and if the price turns down from this level, the likelihood of a break below $22,800 increases. If that happens, the selling may intensify and the pair may slide to $21,480.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price breaks above the 20-EMA, it will suggest that bulls are buying on dips. That could push the pair to the 50-simple moving average and keep the price stuck inside the range for some more time.\n\nLDO/USDT\n\nLido DAO (LDO) did not sustain below the 20-day EMA ($2.75) during the recent correction, which is a positive sign. Another bullish sign is the formation of the pennant near the local highs.\n\nLDO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to propel the price above the resistance line of the pennant. If they succeed, the LDO/USDT pair could start the next leg of the up-move. The pair may first rise to $3.90 and thereafter attempt a rally to $4.24.\n\nConversely, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. That could keep the price inside the pennant for a while longer. The bears will have to sink the price below the pennant if they want to signal a short-term trend reversal.\n\nLDO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe strong bounce off the support line of the pennant indicates aggressive buying on dips. Buyers will have to overcome the obstacle at the resistance line to regain control. If they do that, the pair may resume its uptrend.\n\nHowever, the bears are likely to have other plans as they will try to protect the resistance line. If the price turns down from this level, the state of equilibrium may continue for some more time.\n\nA break below the pennant could attract profit-booking by short-term traders. That may tug the price to $2.20 and later to $2.\n\nEGLD/USDT\n\nMultiversX (EGLD) turned down from the resistance line but an encouraging sign is that the bulls are trying to defend the 20-day EMA ($47).\n\nEGLD/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 54, indicating that buyers have a slight edge. The bulls will try to push the price toward the resistance line where they are again likely to face strong opposition from the bears.\n\nThis bullish view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA. That will indicate selling by the bears on every minor rally. The EGLD/USDT pair could then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($44) and later to $40.\n\nEGLD/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is falling inside a descending channel pattern. Buyers purchased at lower levels and have pushed the price to the resistance line of the channel. If this resistance gives way, the pair could rise to the 50-SMA and thereafter attempt a retest of the strong barrier at $54.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that the bears have not given up. That could result in a drop toward the support line of the channel.\n\nRelated: How does the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) impact cryptocurrencies? Watch Macro Markets\n\nTHETA/USDT\n\nThe bulls are trying to arrest Theta Network\u2019s (THETA) pullback at the 20-day EMA ($1.15). Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating advantage to the bulls.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf buyers thrust the price above the downtrend line, the THETA/USDT pair could climb to the overhead resistance at $1.34. This is a formidable resistance and a break above it could open the gates for a possible surge to $1.70.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and plunges below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the short-term bulls may be rushing to the exit. That may start a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($1.05) and then to the psychological support at $1.\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern. Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is oscillating near the center, indicating a balance between supply and demand.\n\nA break below the triangle could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The pair could first fall to $1.12 and then to $1.\n\nIf bulls want to prevent the decline, they will have to quickly propel the price above the triangle. That could start a journey to $1.27 and later to $1.30.\n\nKLAY/USDT\n\nKlaytn (KLAY) is attempting to break out from a basing pattern. The price rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($0.26) on Feb. 25, indicating solid buying on dips.\n\nKLAY/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to pierce the overhead resistance at $0.34. If they do that, the KLAY/USDT pair could pick up momentum and soar to the psychological resistance at $0.50. Such a move will signal a potential trend change.\n\nIf the price turns down from $0.34, it will indicate that bears are fiercely protecting the level. That could again pull the price down to the 20-day EMA. A break below this level could indicate that the pair may spend some more time in the basing pattern.\n\nKLAY/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls arrested the pullback near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of $0.26 and started a recovery. There is a minor resistance at $0.32 but if this level is crossed, the pair could attempt a rally to $0.34 and thereafter to $0.37.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. That may enhance the prospects of a break below $0.26. If that happens, the pair may slide to $0.22.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
