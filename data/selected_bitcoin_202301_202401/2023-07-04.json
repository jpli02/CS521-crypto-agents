This significant recovery in Bitcoin's price has also spurred buying activity in various altcoins, causing them to rise substantially from their annual lows. After reaching above the $31,000 mark on June 23, Bitcoin consolidated at $30,000 throughout the past week. It currently remains near the strong resistance level of $31,000, with neither bulls or bears taking control in the larger time frame.To gain momentum, buyers must restore the rate to the $31,200 zone, potentially leading to a breakout above the $31,458 resistance level. This indicates that the bulls are not rushing to secure profits, as they expect further upward movement. Bulls have shown increased interest in Bitcoin recently, driven by the positive investor sentiment, which has been fueled by notable financial institutions such as BlockRock Invesco , and WisdomTree filing for Bitcoin ETFs However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said these filings were inadequate last Friday, citing a lack of clarity and the need for additional information before reconsidering approval. Despite this news, BTC has maintained a positive stance well above the $30,000 level. BTC's support level currently stands at $29,500. This week will feature significant economic events in the US, including the release of the FOMC minutes for June on Wednesday, the job openings report on Thursday, and new employment numbers on Friday, which may introduce some market volatility.Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading in close proximity to the $2,000 level.

        "title": "Bitcoin trades flat after losing US$31,000 peg; Solana gains; Polygon, BNB lead losers - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether traded little changed on Wednesday morning in Asia, while the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. Bitcoin fell back under US$31,000, but its dominance in total crypto market cap is gaining, a sign of market recovery. Solana added to its gains this week, while Polygon\u2019s Matic and the BNB tokens led the daily losers list. Bitcoin Cash has taken the number 12 spot in the list of top tokens by market cap after its listing on the new EDX Markets exchange.\n\nCrypto price pause\n\nBitcoin fell 1.0% over the last 24 hours to US$30,801 at 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, shaving its weekly gain down to 0.39%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. On Tuesday, the price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, on the back of optimism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications by a raft of Wall Street heavyweights, including Blackrock.\n\nThe level of Bitcoin dominance sits near 50%, which is the highest since April 2021. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, says this price uptrend in Bitcoin is a typical market recovery pattern in which the most significant asset in the sector attracts buyers first.\n\n\u201cIt will probably take about a year of Bitcoin price recovery before crypto enthusiasts start looking for one with higher risk, pushing altcoins higher and leading to a new wave of capitalisation swell,\u201d said Kuptsikevich, in an email statement. He said he doesn\u2019t see altcoins rallying before November.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent price recovery was sparked by Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, filing an application last month to launch a Bitcoin ETF and refiling it again after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated it lacked details.\n\nSeveral other U.S.-based asset managers, such as Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree, have filed their own Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting mainstream finance recognizes the Bitcoin opportunity and wants to offer clients the access to its price movements without actually owning the token.\n\nStory continues\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, looked to be on a run to break US$2,000 this week, but fell back 0.81% to US$1,941 today after a gain of 2.64% for the past seven days.\n\nThe other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization traded mixed to flat, with Solana leading gainers with a 2.0% rise to US$19.45. The token has surged 15.35% in the past week.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic and Binance\u2019s BNB token were amongst the losers \u2014 Matic lost 1.99% to US$0.6981, though it\u2019s still up 4.29% for the week. BNB lost 1.68% to US$242.83, cutting its weekly gain to 1.81%.\n\nAltcoins have suffered from the SEC\u2019s crackdown on tokens that they deem financial securities. Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB were among those that the regulator named as unregistered securities in its lawsuits filed against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges in early June.\n\nWhile these altcoins have partially recovered after an initial plunge following the SEC suits, several trading platforms including California-based Robinhood Markets Inc., Israel-based eToro and UK\u2019s Revolut ceased support or limited access to some of these tokens for their U.S.-based customers.\n\nBitcoin Cash climbed to become the twelfth largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap at US$53.8 billion. The Bitcoin spin-off is one of the four cryptocurrencies listed on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed, compliance-focused crypto exchange that launched on June 20 in the U.S.\n\nBitcoin Cash had a market capitalization of US$20.6 billion and was valued at US$106.34 on June 19. It has since surged 160% to US$276.87. It dipped 1.70% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 0.80% to US$1.21 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 22.22% to US$31.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAzuki dents NFT sentiment\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.28% in the 24 hours to 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,783.58, but logged a loss of 3.17% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets rose.\n\nHowever, despite moderate gains in the indexes on Wednesday morning, the NFT market overall remains in a downtrend, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects declining sales prices across collections on all chains, but it\u2019s Ethereum that\u2019s really dragging the market down with it,\u201d said Petscher, pointing to the recent problems with the Azuki NFT collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki\u2019s struggles exasperated the already struggling market \u2026 Azuki\u2019s new Elementals mint was supposed to be a boom for NFTs and instead was a bust, becoming a catalyst that drove NFT collections down to all-time lows.\u201d\n\nAzuki NFT creator Chiru Labs debuted its latest Elementals collection last Tuesday, to much negative response from the community, who deemed it almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nWhile the team behind Azuki posted an public apology to buyers on Twitter, dissatisfied Azuki holders formed the Azuki DAO last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO.\n\nLegalDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization formed in 2020 by a group of legal professionals, said Tuesday that it will help Azuki DAO in the effort to claim the 20,000 ETH.\n\nBy NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the trading volume rankings on Cryptoslam with US$3 million, but the volume was down 18.97% on the day. Mutant Ape Yacht Club, another Yuga Labs\u2019 Ethereum-based collection, saw its volume grow 11.94% to US$2.39 million to place second in the rankings.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 9.24% to US$31.5 million. Volume on Ethereum fell 9.17% to US$22.7 million according to Cryptoslam data. Volume on the Bitcoin network gained 3.73% to US$3.19 million, while volumes on Polygon, Solana and BNB all plunged.\n\nU.S. equity futures drop during holiday\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures dipped as of 10:45 a.m. in Hong Kong ahead of the restart of trading in the U.S. following the July 4 public holiday.\n\nFutures on all three indexes \u2013 Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq \u2013 declined but by less than 1%.\n\nAsian equities opened lower Wednesday morning. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.5%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dipped 1.3%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index edged down 0.3%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi also lost 0.08%.\n\nThe Caixin China General Composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2014 a measure of the performance of both the manufacturing and services sectors in China \u2014 dropped to 52.5 in June from 55.6 the previous month. This marks the sixth consecutive month of expansion for China\u2019s private sector. However, the growth rate was the slowest since January.\n\nEmployment in China also returned to growth, as the service sector created more jobs following a drop in manufacturing payrolls, according to Trading Economics.\n\nIn the U.S., New York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. The Fed will also release its June meeting minutes on Wednesday, where it decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, down from 89.9% on Tuesday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 12.6%.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"
