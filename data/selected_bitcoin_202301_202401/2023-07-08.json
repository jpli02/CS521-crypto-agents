        "content": "Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nEchoing last week, the values of market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum remained pretty inert over the past seven days.\n\nNonetheless, market leader Bitcoin (BTC) hit a one-year high after crossing the $31,000 threshold on Monday on news that the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, was refiling its application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot ETF\u2014a regulated investment vehicle that, if approved, would provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin without the dangers of buying it directly.\n\nThe SEC expressed misgivings about BlackRock\u2019s first filing last month, stating broadly that none of the many applicants for a Bitcoin spot ETF have been specific enough about how they'll integrate a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" to deter fraud and manipulation. Such an agreement would allow applicants to monitor market trading activity and clearing activity and verify customer identity.\n\nBlackRock named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner in its refiling. Two days later, the crypto-focused asset manager Valkyrie also refiled its ETF application and, echoing BlackRock, it named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner.\n\nIn another bullish sign for Bitcoin fans, the crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot became the first company of its kind to be publicly listed on the NASDAQ on Monday.\n\nHowever, the headlines weren\u2019t enough to turn Bitcoin\u2019s upward price movement into a sustained rally. The biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped back under $31,000 on Tuesday, then briefly recrossed the threshold early on Thursday before bottoming out at $30,153.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility settled down by the weekend.

The second biggest cryptocurrency in the world dropped in value 2.8% to enter the weekend at $1,861. It moved in step with Bitcoin, posting intraweek highs of close to $2,000 on Monday and Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe prices of most of the top thirty cryptocurrencies remained flat over the last seven days. The biggest growth was observed in Solana (SOL), which exploded 20% to hit $22.85 by Saturday, up nearly 20% for the week.\n\nRemarkably, Solana thrived in spite of news that popular trading app Revolut is delisting it\u2014along with Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA)\u2014after they were named as securities by the SEC in its ongoing lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.\n\nBig losses were felt by holders of Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).

        "title": "Coinbase Is The Real Winner in the Bitcoin ETF Race - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the last month, a wave of major financial institutions have applied to offer spot Bitcoin (BTC -0.18%) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in a bid to bridge Wall Street with the original cryptocurrency. BlackRock (BLK -0.43%) made headlines on June 15 as the first firm to submit an application, followed by Fidelity, Ark Invest, Invesco, WisdomTree, and VanEck, all vying for a piece of the Bitcoin ETF market.\n\nWhile the potential benefits for Bitcoin itself seem obvious, there is another player that stands to gain significantly from this race: Coinbase Global (COIN -1.72%).\n\nThe current situation\n\nAfter receiving the applications, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wasted no time in reviewing them and promptly sent them back for revisions, deeming them \"inadequate.\" The main issue it identified was a lack of clarity on how the firms would minimize fraud and market manipulation, a key concern for the agency.\n\nIn response to the SEC's feedback, each of the six firms expeditiously refiled their applications and tapped Coinbase as the partner for a shared surveillance agreement. By adding measures to monitor potential market manipulation, Coinbase will play a crucial role in enhancing market integrity and providing the necessary oversight asked for by the government.\n\nTaking on a bigger role\n\nCoinbase's integral role in these applications is a testament to its position as a leader in the cryptocurrency industry. But the true opportunity for Coinbase lies not only in its surveillance capabilities but also in the additional services it will provide to the proposed fund issuers.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Coinbase is expected to perform various functions for these firms, including custodial services and acting as a trading platform to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, both Ark Invest and BlackRock have tapped Coinbase for their custodial services. BlackRock explicitly states in its SEC filing that it will use Coinbase Prime, a product tailored for institutional investors, as the platform for its Bitcoin transactions.\n\nA lucrative opportunity\n\nTransaction fees and custodial services have historically contributed around 10% of Coinbase's quarterly revenue, but now that the platform might serve as a custodian and a brokerage with some of the biggest names on Wall Street, introduction of the Bitcoin ETFs could significantly bolster profits.\n\nTo understand the full scope of how much capital could be involved, we can take a look at the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC 3.00%), a popular product that provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin but one plagued with limitations such as inaccurate price tracking, a shortcoming that a spot ETF can remedy.\n\nAs of today, Grayscale holds more than 625,000 Bitcoins to back its Bitcoin Trust, totaling more than $19 billion. Assuming Coinbase hasn't changed its pricing structure since 2021 and still charges a 0.1% fee on custodial accounts, if it were to hold close to the same number of Bitcoins as the Grayscale Trust, the potential revenue from fees could amount to approximately $190 million based on recent Bitcoin prices. With net revenue from the first quarter of 2023 totaling $736 million, a boost in custodial fees of this size could increase Coinbase's bottom line by roughly 25%.\n\nAdding to the profitability of custodial services, Coinbase is in line to also benefit from transaction fees. A unique feature of the new spot ETF applications is that the firms will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin on a daily basis, a feature not currently present with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. (This explains why it goes through bouts of trading at premiums or discounts relative to Bitcoin's actual price.)\n\nWith this added functionality, firms like BlackRock will be conducting a multitude of large transactions on a near-daily basis to help the ETF track Bitcoin's price more accurately, potentially adding a significant boost to Coinbase's revenue.\n\nSome necessary context\n\nDespite Coinbase's ongoing lawsuit involving the SEC, the momentum and common theme among all the ETF applications should be viewed as a vote of confidence from some of Wall Street's biggest players looking to do business with the company regardless of the SEC suit.\n\nAlthough no ETF has been approved yet, the SEC's blessing looks more likely by the day. Even better, Coinbase shares still remain down more than 75% from their all-time high.\n\nFor investors seeking exposure to the crypto industry's continued growth and a potential SEC approval of the United States' first spot Bitcoin ETF, Coinbase could be a compelling long-term opportunity at current prices."
