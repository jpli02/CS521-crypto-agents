        "content": "Bitcoin Sender Mistakenly Overpays Record $3M in Transaction Fees\n\nA Bitcoin (BTC) sender made a costly error by paying an unprecedented $3 million in transaction fees for a single transaction. The sender intended to send 139.42 BTC, valued at around $5.1 million, but mistakenly lost 83.64 BTC in fees, leaving the recipient with only 55.77 BTC, approximately $2 million. This transaction fee sets a new record in Bitcoin's history.\n\nAccording to blockchain data from Bitinfocharts, the transaction was processed by Bitcoin miner AntPool in block 818087. While Bitcoin transactions can be expensive during busy periods, data from Bitinfocharts indicates that the average transaction fee on the Bitcoin network is currently $14.1.\n\nIn September, stablecoin issuer Paxos paid a $500,000 fee for processing a transaction worth just $2,000. Fortunately, Bitcoin miner F2Pool agreed to refund the excessive payment in that instance.\n\nWhile this is a costly mistake, Bitcoin transaction fees have been surging lately due to growing interest in Bitcoin Ordinals. Ordinals are digital assets inscribed on the smallest unit of Bitcoin, called a satoshi. The inclusion of Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain has increased network activity, resulting in higher transaction costs.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -2.25% 's price could surpass $40,000 this year after Binance\u2019s DOJ settlement and former CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s guilty plea to financial violations signaled a turning point in the crypto landscape, according to Matrixport analyst Markus Thielen.\n\nBinance's agreement to pay $4.3 billion in fines marks one of the largest corporate settlements in U.S. history. After stepping down as CEO, Zhao will pay a $50 million fine and a $175 million personal recognizance bond. He also faces a possible 18-month prison sentence, with a hearing set for Feb. 23.\n\nThe outcome, less severe than a feared $10 billion fine and not accusing Binance of misappropriating user funds or alleging market manipulation, suggests it will likely remain a top-three exchange over the next 2 to 3 years, the analyst argued.\n\nDespite the Binance news initially being perceived as a risk-off event, bitcoin only experienced a temporary correction, Thielen said, bouncing back from the $36,000 level in a \"robust counter-trend reaction.\u201d with \u201cbitcoin surging above $40,000 inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe anticipate bitcoin surpassing $38,000 by the end of this month with an 80% probability, followed by a rally above $40,000 in December with 90% probability,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nBitcoin seasonality\n\nOctober 2023 saw bitcoin's price soar by 28%, a trend that may continue with the anticipated approval of a bitcoin spot ETF in the U.S., the Matrixport analyst said, something that would further underscore confidence in bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.\n\nSeasonality is another factor, with average December returns of 12% potentially lifting bitcoin to $42,000 by this metric alone, he added.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nTether\u2019s USDT market capitalization increases by $5 billion\n\nSince September, Tether\u2019s USDT market capitalization has increased by $5 billion, signaling a growing trend among institutional investors shifting from fiat into stablecoins, potentially converting them into other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, Thielen said.\n\n\u201cLast night, another $600 million USDT appeared to be minted, potentially signaling inflows into bitcoin after the Binance/CZ deal with U.S. enforcement authorities that seemed to increase the probability that a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF could be approved by January,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nMacro environment supportive of crypto\n\nThe macro-environment also continues to support crypto, Thielen said, with Matrixport anticipating another halving of inflation toward 1.6% and a decline in bond yields to 2.60% by 2024 or 2025, following the peak of the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield at 4.95% in this cycle.\n\nThe adjustment in bond yields is expected to usher in a surge for the stock market, which often correlates with cryptocurrencies, the analyst added."
