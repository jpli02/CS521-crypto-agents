        "content": "A sign is seen in a stand during the Bitcoin Conference 2023, in Miami Beach, Florida, U.S., May 19, 2023.\n\nThis report is from today's CNBC Daily Open, our new, international markets newsletter. CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here .\n\nDip in markets\n\nU.S. markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was flat, but major bourses dipped slightly and ended the day in the red. Germany's DAX lost 0.1% as new data showed the country's July exports dropping 0.9% on the month and 1% year on year, adding to fears about the German economy contracting in the third quarter.\n\n'Sick man of Europe'\n\nGermany is once again the \"sick man of Europe,\" said Hans-Werner Sinn, president emeritus at the Ifo institute. The country's business activity in August contracted sharply, according to the HCOB flash purchasing managers index. Moreover, Germany's plans to be carbon neutral by 2045 poses a risk to its industry, which might cause a \"backlash\" from the population, Sinn said.\n\nMissing Xi at G20\n\nPremier Li Qiang will lead China's delegation at the G20 summit in New Delhi this weekend, said China's foreign ministry. While the ministry declined to confirm if President Xi Jinping would attend the summit, spokesperson Mao Ning didn't correct reporters who asked if Li's attendance meant Xi would not show up. Another noteworthy absence: Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNegotiating new grain deal\n\nPutin met his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, Russia on Monday. Putin reportedly said Russia is ready to renew the Black Sea Grain Initiative which allowed Ukraine to export agricultural products \u2014 but only if concessions are made to Russia as well.\n\n[PRO] Don't sleep on these stocks\n\nAdults need seven to nine hours of sleep per day. Even though 63% of U.S. adults don't meet that requirement, they are growing increasingly concerned about their wellbeing, according to a 2022 McKinsey survey. That's the start of a good dream for these sleep-related stocks."

        "title": "Why cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are unlikely to disappear anytime soon - The Economic Times",
        "content": "I \u2019m sorry to say that Bitcoin has not been cancelled. After the FTX collapse, I had written that I was happy crypto had not been officially regulated in India. However, it\u2019s clear that apart from the taxation-based measures, there won\u2019t be a crypto ban in India, unlike, say, in China. This is fine. Crypto should not be regulated, and those who dabble in it should be left to their own devices. They should be free to go bankrupt in the manner and time they choose.At the same time, the FTX scam has not proven to be the death knell of crypto, something one could have hoped for. This implies that the cryptocurrency market may now be a permanent fixture in the global financial landscape . FTX has demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to attract billions from investors around the globe and squander it, and yet, fail to fundamentally challenge the underlying basis of cryptocurrency. The potential for profit is simply too great and too easy to attain. The prevailing opinion is that cryptocurrency is a valid asset class, and while there may be some regulatory hurdles, these will eventually be resolved. In time, another surge in value is inevitable, leading to a significant increase in the value of the surviving currencies and tokens. Consequently, a new wave of unsuspecting savers worldwide will jeopardise their finances. While many of the fringe cryptos have become irrelevant, Bitcoin has survived and has actually performed well enough for people to start getting fooled again. This year, for instance, despite the recent drops, Bitcoin is up 57%. In fact, from its low in November last year to its high in mid-July this year, Bitcoin has doubled.Any speculative asset that can randomly double and halve is well equipped to be exploited for luring newcomers. Clearly, this is the role that Bitcoin will play well from now onwards. Unfortunately, this could continue in the foreseeable future. Looking at the Bitcoin advocacy in social media, it becomes evident that the FTX crash and the post-FTX period have, in a somewhat paradoxical manner, benefited Bitcoin. The Bitcoin advocates\u2019 argument now is that if it has survived this, it will survive anything.At a rational level, it is not possible to refute this argument in a manner that will satisfy the surviving cryptomaniacs. To them, it\u2019s just the line of graph that matters. If someone\u2019s entire focus is on speculative trading without regard to the asset class, then Bitcoin serves perfectly well. In fact, it serves better than anything else because the more violent the gyrations of price, the more exciting the speculation. If something shoots up drastically and then falls as spectacularly, those who guess correctly will make that much more. This is like a drug to an addict. The crypto phenomenon cannot be understood without looking at the ordinary people who drive it. Some time ago, I read a book, Cryptostorm, written by business journalist Sundeep Khanna. It focuses almost entirely on people who got caught up in crypto. It\u2019s a very diverse set of people, with many defying our stereotypical image of cryptomaniacs.There\u2019s a small-town teacher, a hacker, a lawyer, and a student, among others. In many of these, one can see a yearning, a desire that if technology can create so many changes at such a fast pace, perhaps it can change money too. The entire crypto propaganda is based on inventing and exploiting this urge. Unfortunately for all these people, the rules of money and investing don\u2019t change. That\u2019s why this story will continue. Beyond criminal activities and ransomware, cryptocurrency is perfectly designed to take advantage of the savers, who lack the fundamental understanding about why some investments succeed and others seem too promising to be real. Human nature is invariably marked by greed, as well as the manipulation of this greed by others. That is not going to change.(The author is CEO, VALUE RESEARCH.)"

The U.S. still accounts for US$23 billion, or 80% of the total assets invested in listed Bitcoin fund products.\u201d\n\nEther slipped 0.18% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,638 and declined 0.03% during the past week.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token was the day\u2019s biggest winner in the top 10, after it rose 1.9% in the past 24 hours to US$19.84, but remained near a two-month low.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.31% to US$1.05 trillion while market volume increased 8.21% to US$21.56 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nMythos Chain becomes 2nd largest network by NFT sales, Lufthansa launches NFT rewards platform on Polygon\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.28% to 2,198.27 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 1.93% during the week.\n\nStory continues\n\nMythos Chain became the second largest blockchain by 24-hour sales volume, despite its sales falling 17.44% in the past 24 hours to US$1.15 million. The network was boosted by the DMarket collection that generated US$1.14 million in sales for the network in the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 6.49% to US$5.05 million, but sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 33.69% to US$446,463.\n\nIn the wider NFT space, Lufthansa Group, the parent company of one of the world\u2019s largest airlines, announced the launch of an NFT-based loyalty program called Uptrip. Built on the Polygon blockchain, the platform will reward travelers with digital trading cards.\n\nFollowing the positive news, the Forkast POL NFT Composite rose 0.65% during the day, while all other Forkast Labs NFT indexes were in the red.\n\nAsian, European equities rise ahead of ECB President Christine Lagarde\u2019s speech\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posting gains.\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index logged its biggest weekly gains in over a month last Friday, as the country ramped up policy support for its ailing post-Covid economic recovery, according to Reuters on Monday. Investor confidence also received a boost from Beijing\u2019s measure to allow cities to reduce payments for homebuyers and encourage lenders to lower rates on existing mortgages, to boost the country\u2019s real estate industry.\n\nOver in the U.S., the stock market is closed for the Labor Day holiday.\n\nMajor European bourses started the week in the green, with the benchmark STOXX 600 rising 0.66% and Frankfurt\u2019s DAX 40 up 0.5% for the day, in line with its Asian peers that also strengthened, fueled by optimism over China\u2019s property support measures.\n\nInvestors are anticipating a speech by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde at the Distinguished Speakers Seminar organized by the European Economics & Financial Centre later today, expecting further clues on the bloc\u2019s interest rate trajectory.\n\nSee related article: Grayscale wins against SEC as India moves on blockchain; Friend.tech loses friends\n\nUpdates with equities"

Ether dipped to near the US$1,600 mark, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP posted the biggest gains while Solana led the losers. Digital asset investment products saw a minor outflow last week accompanied by a surge in trading volumes, indicating mixed sentiment among institutional investors. U.S. stock futures traded mixed ahead of regular trading following the long holiday weekend.\n\nBitcoin below US$26,000\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.57% in the last 24 hours to US$25,804.63 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 1.15%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency had been trading in the US$26,000 range since Friday. It briefly breached US$28,000 last Tuesday as an apparent victory for Grayscale Investment against the U.S. Securties and Exchange Commission boosted sentiment. That optimism has now cooled.\n\nEther dipped 0.49% to US$1,627.26, losing 1.58% over the past seven days.\n\nThe crypto market is suffering from regulatory uncertainties in the U.S., said Samer Hasn, market analyst for online brokerage XS.com, in an emailed comment. He also noted the effect of large transactions on the market, including a US$213 million XRP transaction and a US$37 million Shiba Inu transaction recorded over the weekend.\n\n\u201cAlthough the reasons behind the series of huge transfers that we are witnessing in the cryptocurrency market are not yet completely clear, I believe that they may continue to fuel a state of anticipation and caution in the markets, especially since these transfers come amid weak sentiment among market participants, with the continuing battle in the judicial arena in the United States,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance\u2019s global head of product Mayur Kamat resigned from the company, Reuters reported on Monday. The world\u2019s largest crypto exchange faces lawsuits from the U.S. SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as an investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nStory continues\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, with movement within the 1% range across the board. XRP led the winners with a 0.61% gain to US$0.5082, but remained 3.01% lower for the week.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw a minor outflow of US$11.2 million in the week ending Sept. 1. That was a slowdown from US$168 million last week, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Despite the small outflow, digital investment products\u2019 trading volume totaled US$2.8 billion, a 90% rise on the year-to-date average.\n\n\u201cThe recent minor outflows from digital asset funds may be due to uncertainty around the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 following an initial surge of enthusiasm upon their announcement,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, it will be interesting to see how these regulatory uncertainties are balanced,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event will see the amount of new tokens issued every 10 minutes cut in half, increasing its scarcity. This is widely anticipated to produce a surge in the token\u2019s price. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024.\n\nElsewhere, crypto exchange Bybit introduced TradeGPT on Monday \u2014 an artificial intelligence-powered education tool that uses ChatGPT to generate market analysis and answer technical questions based on Bybit\u2019s real-time market data. Other crypto exchanges including Binance, Crypto.com and OKX also launched A.I.-powered analyzing tools earlier this year.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.56% to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume rose 20.65% to US$23.77 billion.\n\nU.S. stock futures dip; China services activity slows\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading lower ahead of the opening bell Tuesday after a holiday-extended weekend for markets. Despite closing mixed on Friday, all three major U.S. indexes posted weekly gains, with Friday\u2019s jobs data easing rate hike worries.\n\nAll the main stock indexes across Asia were showing losses as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nChina\u2019s release of key economic data Tuesday morning cast a cloud over markets. The Caixin China services purchasing managers index (PMI) \u2014 a private gauge of the business activities in the country\u2019s service industry \u2014 dropped from 54.1 in July to 51.8 in August, the lowest level in the past eight months. A PMI reading above 50 indicates a growth in business activities, while a sub-50 reading indicates a contraction.\n\nThe PMI report followed an unexpected expansion in China\u2019s manufacturing industry on September 1. But a slowdown of growth in the services industry provides more evidence of a wider economic downturn.\n\n\u201cThe marginal slowdown in the services sector\u2019s supply and demand expansion offset the improvement in manufacturing production and demand,\u201d Wang Zhe, an economist at Caixin Insight Group, told Reuters. \u201cThere was still considerable downward pressure on the economy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Japan\u2019s manufacturing PMI rose from 53.8 in July to 54.3 in August \u2014 the highest reading in three months, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA stronger improvement in new orders received by Japanese service firms underpinned an acceleration in business activity growth,\u201d Usamah Bhatti, an economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Reuters. \u201cThat said, service providers signalled a steeper increase in inflationary pressures during August.\u201d\n\nInvestors now await a decision on interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia expected later Tuesday. Analysts expect the country\u2019s central bank to keep the rate unchanged at 4.10% for the third straight month, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Reserve will meet on Sept. 20 to make its next move on interest rates, which are currently between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in 22 years.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the Fed will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, up from 78% on August 28.\n\nFurther indication of how the Fed\u2019s plan for rates will arrive with a series of official speeches on Thursday. Elsewhere, S&P will release its U.S. services purchasing manager index (PMI) for August on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"
