        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s crypto winter appears to be thawing, bouncing to the $43,000-$46,000 range, up 159% from last December as tracked by Dow Jones Market Data Group. The upward move could be the start of a new cycle.\n\n\"There seems to be a lot of retail investor sentiment that's been sidelined. There hasn't been the hype and excitement that you've seen kind of mid to late cycle of the last crypto rally. So that actually gives us confidence that we're still a little bit early innings, that there's a lot of capital that has a cushion,\" John Todaro, senior research analyst, Needham & Company, told FOX Business.\n\nSeveral tailwinds are fueling the recent run. The Federal Reserve, which ends its final meeting of the year Wednesday, may start cutting rates in March 2024, according to forecasts tracked by the CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool, which would be supportive of cryptos.\n\nPlus, BlackRock and Fidelity have pending applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds filed and under review with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There has been speculation at least one of these could win approval, which would mark the first Bitcoin ETF. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose firm oversees $9 trillion in assets, commented on rumors of a possible approval during an appearance of \"The Claman Countdown\" in October.\n\nFOX BUSINESS' LIVE CRYPTO PRICES: HERE\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % BLK BLACKROCK INC. 809.12 -16.92 -2.05%\n\n\"I can't talk about the specifics of anything, I think it's just an example of the pent-up interest in crypto. We are hearing from clients around the world about the need for crypto,\" Fink said. Investors, including Todaro are eyeing early January for a possible decision.\n\nMany investors who held Bitcoin when it was trading at the all-time high of $67,802.30 in November 2021, before sinking to the $16,000-$17,000 range, are gun shy, Todaro noted, but he sees a turning point.\n\n\"I think if Bitcoin crosses $50,000, which is a psychological point for a lot of retail investors, I think it starts to see a wave of some of that capital come back,\" he added.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % COIN COINBASE GLOBAL INC. 233.67 -18.06 -7.17%\n\nAdditionally, Todaro has a buy rating on crypto trading exchange Coinbase, which gets 90% of its revenue from retail customers. He notes interest in its app on the Apple store bottomed to No. 40 in February 2023 following the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all charges last month and is facing over 100 years in prison.\n\nFTX KING SAM BANKMAN-FRIED FOUND GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES\n\nSince it has recovered to No. 24 this month, further improvement would correlate with retail investors putting new money to work.\n\nTodaro has a $160 per-share price target on Coinbase.\n\nCoinbase\n\nNot everyone is a believer. Last week JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told lawmakers during a hearing that cryptocurrencies are for criminals and if he had control of the U.S. government he would \"close it down.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin is the undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency asset class. In a November 10 Barchart article highlighting Bitcoin, I wrote:\n\nThe bullish technical break in October 2023 could lead to much higher prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies as investors, trend-following traders, and speculators flock to the asset class. However, the historical trading pattern shows that the higher they rise, the greater the odds of another price implosion. Like a game of speculative musical chairs, when the bullish music stops, buyers become sellers, and prices can plunge.\n\nLast week, Bitcoin rose to over $44,000 per token, the highest level since April 2022. With the leading crypto at high 2023 highs late in the year, a speculative frenzy could take Bitcoin to higher highs over the coming weeks.\n\nThe next technical resistance level is at over $48,000 per token\n\nBitcoin is steaming toward the March 2022 high, the technical resistance area on the long-term chart.\n\nAs the chart dating back to 2010 shows, Bitcoin\u2019s next upside target is $48,187.21, the March 2022 high. Above there, Bitcoin faces resistance at $59,043.43, the December 2021 peak, and $68,906.48, the November 2021 record high.\n\nEthereum rises to a new 2023 high- The technical target is above $3,500 per token\n\nEthereum, the second-leading cryptocurrency, has followed Bitcoin higher, moving to a new 2023 high.\n\nThe chart illustrates at a high of over $2,400 per token on December 8, 2023, Ethereum is moving towards the $3,579.866 peak. Ethereum\u2019s all-time high was $4,865.426 in November 2021.\n\nAt the late 2021 highs, the cryptocurrency asset class\u2019s market cap rose to the $3 trillion level. On December 8, it was over $1.6 trillion. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap was 53.7% of the total, while Ethereum\u2019s was 17.1%. The two leaders had 70.8% of the total market cap. Bitcoin\u2019s was over $860 billion, with Ethereum\u2019s near $275 billion. Tether (USDT) had around a $90 billion market cap and was the third most valuable crypto. However, Tether\u2019s market cap was one-third of second place Ethereum\u2019s, indicating the asset class\u2019s significant value concentration in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nRIOT has a great year with more upside potential\n\nRiot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) is a Bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure company. At the $15.83 per share level on December 8, RIOT had a market cap of over $3.269 billion. RIOT is a highly liquid stock, trading an average of over 26.28 million shares daily.\n\nThe chart shows that after reaching a $3.25 low in late December 2022, RIOT shares have rallied 387% over the past year. Technical resistance is at the July 10, 2023, $20.65 per share, and RIOT traded to $79.50 in February 2021. RIOT could have lots of upside if the rally in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues.\n\nMARA is in a bullish trend\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings Inc. (MARA) also mines cryptocurrencies with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets. At $16.78 per share, MARA\u2019s market cap was around $3.735 billion, with average daily trading volume at nearly 49 million shares.\n\nWhen Bitcoin reached its bottom, MARA reached a $3.11 per share low in late 2022. At $16.78 on December 8, MARA was over 439.5% higher. Technical resistance is at the July 2023 $19.88 high. In November 2021, when Bitcoin peaked, MARA traded to $83.45 per share. Like RIOT, MARA will track Bitcoin higher or lower over the coming weeks and months.\n\nBITQ moves towards a critical resistance level\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) tracks the performance of companies involved in blockchain and the digital currency asset class. At $10.18 per share on December 8, BITQ had around $115.3 million in assets under management. The ETF trades an average of more than 180,000 shares daily and charges a 0.85% management fee.\n\nAfter trading to a $3.20 low in late December 2022, BITQ has more than tripled over the past year. Technical resistance is at the July $11.34 high. BITQ traded to a record high of $35.68 in November 2021.\n\nThe trend is always your best friend in markets. Cryptocurrencies, a highly speculative asset class, have a history of boom-and-bust price action. They are back in boom mode after reaching significant bottoms in late 2022. If Bitcoin and Ethereum are moving towards a challenge of the November 2021 record highs, expect RIOT, MARA, and BITQ to follow on the upside. These liquid stocks are regulated and do not require computer wallets or holding cryptos on platforms.\n\nThe upside potential comes with commensurate risks. Only invest capital you are willing to lose in the cryptocurrency asset class, as the oversized reward potential involves the risk of a total loss.\n\nMore Crypto News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrew Hecht did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
