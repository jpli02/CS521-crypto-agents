        "content": "The correlation between bitcoin and ether prices fell below 80% for the first time since November 2021, indicating a significant shift in the relationship between the two largest cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe rolling 30-day correlation between bitcoin and ether dipped to about 78% this week, according to data provider Kaiko. Correlation measures how closely the prices of two assets move together. When the correlation is low, it means their prices are moving in different directions more often.\n\nIn other words, the falling correlation means that BTC and ETH prices are not moving together as closely as they used to.\n\nBitcoin-ether correlation falling\n\nLast month, Coinbase analyzed the correlation between BTC and ETH returns. The exchange concluded that it has been falling since mid-to-late March as bitcoin began to outperform other cryptocurrencies against the backdrop of U.S. banking sector turmoil and heightened regulatory scrutiny on non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\"But the decline of that relationship has become more pronounced in the days following the Shanghai (Shapella) fork, reminiscent of a similar trend observed in September 2022 during the Merge (when Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake),\" Coinbase said at the time.\n\nTheoretically, a falling correlation between two assets reinforces the case for diversification by including both assets in an investment portfolio.\n\nBitcoin and ether prices are up around 62% and 50% so far in 2023, respectively, according to The Block's Data Dashboard.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Going Full Bitcoiner: 1 Million Addresses Now Own 1 BTC or More - Blockworks",
        "content": "Bitcoin hit a wild high of $69,000 in November 2021. And despite a healthy rally in this year\u2019s first quarter, it\u2019s still down nearly two-thirds from its price record.\n\nThe good news? This price drop made it easier for folks to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon or continue stacking sats.\n\nOne million addresses now hold more than 1 BTC ($26,800), according to data from Glassnode.\n\nMost recently, the number of addresses with full BTC status picked up considerably at the end of February last year, when bitcoin was halfway through correcting after its record high.\n\nThere\u2019s some inverse correlation with bitcoin price and the number of \u2018full bitcoiner\u2019 addreses\n\nDan Ashmore, head of research at Investoo Group, told Blockworks that holding a full bitcoin is equal to roughly half the median US salary. So, while it\u2019s now easier than it was back in late 2021, it could eventually be out of reach for many once again if high prices return.\n\n\u201cThis is what we saw during the relentless bull market during the pandemic \u2014 a clear leveling off of the previous trajectory at which the number of addresses containing 1 bitcoin or more was growing,\u201d Ashmore told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cAs bitcoin fell in price last year, the previous upward trajectory in the growth of these addresses was resumed. I would not expect this pattern to change going forward.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that one bitcoin address doesn\u2019t always represent one person, so this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean one million people own 1 BTC. Certain individuals control multiple bitcoin addresses, while some addresses may belong to institutions or groups of people.\n\nAccording to Ashmore, the 1 million milestone highlights how deeply Bitcoin has established itself in the mainstream realm in recent years.\n\nWhales (and exchanges) among million full Bitcoin addresses\n\nDespite the Bitcoin network\u2019s inherent decentralization, the distribution of wealth is more concentrated than commonly assumed.\n\nOnly 7% of the supply (1.356 million BTC, worth $36.4 billion) is distributed among the nearly 46.5 million addresses with at least some bitcoin \u2014 but less than one \u2014 per BitInfoCharts.\n\nThe other 93% (18 million BTC, worth $482.7 billion) exists in the one million addresses that now own a full BTC.\n\nSo, the addresses containing more than 1 BTC represent about 2.1% of all non-zero Bitcoin addresses.\n\nIt must be stressed that those stats are somewhat skewed considering how much BTC resides within crypto exchange addresses \u2014 which mostly represent aggregate user holdings.\n\nCoinGlass shows 1.89 million BTC ($50.7 billion) sitting with crypto exchanges, about one in every 10 bitcoin in circulation, led by Binance, Coinbase and Bitfinex.\n\nThere\u2019s also the 1.46 million BTC ($39.2 billion) that Glassnode considers \u201cprobably lost\u201d forever, equal to 7.5% of all bitcoin in existence right now.\n\nStill, Erik Saberski, vice president of data science at The Tie, pointed out that even distribution across financial systems leads to stability in associated asset classes.\n\nFewer holders, on the other hand, results in imbalanced buying and selling pressure, causing significant price fluctuations. So, more people holding a full bitcoin could indicate increased price stability, reflecting bitcoin\u2019s maturation.\n\n\u201cBecause bitcoin is the flagship asset of the crypto economy, this signal of adoption seems to portend broader growth for the overall digital asset ecosystem,\u201d Saberski told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cWith this in mind, a measure for adoption does not necessarily suggest anything about the market in the short term. Indeed, adoption happens on a much slower timescale.\u201d\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Grimes and Bitcoin: How crypto and the open-source movement offer lessons for the music industry in the age of A.I. - Fortune",
        "content": "An A.I.-generated song featuring a \u201ccollaboration\u201d between Drake and The Weeknd turned up on streaming services and TikTok last month, quickly racking up millions of listens. In response, Universal Music Group, which represents the musicians, issued an agitated statement, and then, as the song turned up on other platforms, embarked on a legal whack-a-mole campaign in a bid to put the A.I. cat back in a bag.\n\nAll of this came even as the legal status of the song remains unclear. Some music business veterans argue the song was functionally no different than a remix, while others decried it as a dangerous new paradigm. Rarely does a video made by a random handle create such uproar.\n\nThen there\u2019s Grimes, who may not be as famous as fellow Canadian Drake, but is a critically acclaimed musician in her own right. Grimes, who is not affiliated with any record label, announced she will use that relative freedom to perform a radical experiment called \u201cElf.Tech.\u201d Using A.I., Elf.Tech allows users to generate a Grimes-style work with their own inputs. In return, all Grimes asks is for tasteful use of their now-open-source talent and a 50% cut on any master recording royalties.\n\nBecause the cost of producing high-quality music has dropped precipitously with advancements in A.I., the race to design a new distribution model is afoot. Currently, platforms must obtain permissions from both publishers and labels to play a song\u2014in most instances, the label owns the sound recording while the publisher controls the underlying music and lyrics. In Grimes\u2019s case, she could be the performer and also own the sound recording.\n\nTellingly, the first prompt on Elf.Tech asks users to connect to an email account or a cryptocurrency wallet. Presumably, the platform anticipates using blockchain and crypto to help enforce the suggested royalty split.\n\nUnfortunately, as veterans of the NFT space know, while smart contracts have the potential to create a more efficient royalties system, the reality is that the process remains messy since NFT marketplaces circumvent the rules. Nonetheless, many maintain hope a cultural or technical innovation\u2014likely tied to crypto\u2014will emerge to help artists enjoy a fairer compensation system.\n\nThough technology doesn\u2019t exist to enforce it yet, my long-term bet is that Grimes\u2019s approach will prevail over Universal\u2019s. The reason is that the challenges of generative A.I. have striking parallels to those of another disruptive technology: open-source software.\n\nAll software began as \u201copen source.\u201d Software vendors would provide their clients with their source code, the human-readable version of the software that\u2019s then transformed into machine code before it\u2019s executed. Tinkerers and computer scientists would modify software, learn from it, and share ideas. As the field commercialized, source code became closely protected, like a trade secret. While companies made handsome profits exerting copyright over their code, allowing for additional investments, the downside was a less cooperative environment.\n\nThe open-source movement, a reaction to ever-tighter controls over software, promoted the release of source code under permissive licenses to foster the tinkering, sharing of ideas, and collaboration seen in the field\u2019s early days. Today, open-source projects range from small hobbyist efforts to large-scale projects such as the Linux kernel, which is deployed in billions of devices around the world.\n\nIn similar fashion, traditional music publishers and labels thrived in a world where counterparties and IP were tightly controlled. Their moat was legal agreements that could hamstring pirates and, in some unfortunate cases, the artists themselves. As experimentation from pseudonymous creators\u2014including those who deploy A.I.\u2014shifts the balance of power from this model, artists will have to find new ways to engage with the increasing commoditization of their work.\n\nBitcoin, the first successful cryptocurrency, succeeded in large part because it was open-sourced. Alternatives to centralized institutions that issue credit require a radically transparent, queryable code base to stand apart. Early enthusiasts trusted the outcome of the Bitcoin ledger because they trusted the process, and because they could check it themselves. Today\u2019s music pioneers would be smart to take note.\n\nThe next few years will see more explicit separation of designing versus controlling music production. To that end, Grimes\u2019s experiment is a worthy exercise pushing the limits of a multibillion-dollar business and our burgeoning world of open-sourced talent.\n\nKathleen Breitman is a cofounder of Tezos.

For those who don\u2019t know him, he is one of the most pro-Bitcoin politicians in the country. He has actively courted Bitcoiners to come to Miami and help make it the Bitcoin capital of the world. So far, he has largely succeeded in doing that.\n\nBut in addition to making the U.S. an epicenter for Bitcoin innovation, having a Bitcoiner like Suarez as president will, critically, stop the emergence of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in America dead in its tracks. If Biden or Trump is elected, it is almost certain that some form of CBDC will be activated in America. With the deployment of a CBDC, you can kiss your financial freedom goodbye. You can kiss your privacy goodbye.\n\nYou will no longer have autonomy over what you can eat or how far you can travel. You will have a social credit score, as has been implemented in China. Is this the type of life that you want? We have to strive for a better life.\n\nJust recently, the rails for a CBDC were introduced to the public. FedNow, as it is called, will be operational by July 2023. It is said that it will be used to speed up payments between customers and businesses, which may be accurate at the moment. However, as with any system, it will likely evolve into something vastly different than what it was intended to be.\n\nCan we really trust a government that has given us the Patriot Act, PRISM and now the proposed RESTRICT Act to resist total control over what you spend your money on?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act, for instance, put forth by none other than Bitcoin-hating Senator Elizabeth Warren, has the potential to harm Bitcoiners in the United States with its overly-broad language about digital communication tools being a threat to national security. While the overt target may be TikTok, nothing is stopping regulators from using this law against Bitcoin in the future.\n\nLooking past this smokescreen, you can see that they are building their case to the public: Hilary Clinton, international regulators and the U.S. Treasury have all warned about the dangers of cryptocurrency.\n\nNow, put this in the context of $31 trillion in U.S. national debt, unsustainable entitlement spending, a world slowly moving away from the dollar, high gas prices and uncontrollable inflation. Then it becomes clear that they will close off the exits to Bitcoin before most people learn about how to use them. They want to herd the masses into a CBDC for a \u201cgreat reset\u201d of the monetary system.
