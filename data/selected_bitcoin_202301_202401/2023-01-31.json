        "content": "Want to see what\u2019s different in markets so far in 2023? Look no further than the performance of Bitcoin versus bonds.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has surged almost 40% so far this year thanks to a general return of risk appetite and the expectation that the Federal Reserve will hit the pause button on hiking interest rates. Of course, those same factors have sparked a rally in bonds \u2014 but not enough to offset historic losses incurred last year."

        "content": "U.S. users of Strike can now use Send Globally to send instant, cheap remittances to loved ones in the Philippines.\n\nStrike, the leading digital payment platform built on Bitcoin's Lightning Network, has announced the expansion of its \"Send Globally\" product to the Philippines. This will allow for fast, secure and low-cost money transfers between the U.S. and the Philippines, which is one of the world's largest remittance markets. The Philippines relies on more than $35 billion annually in money sent from abroad, with over $12 billion coming from the U.S. alone.\n\nStrike has partnered with Pouch.ph to enable transfers from U.S. dollars to Philippine pesos, which can be received in a bank or mobile money account in the Philippines.\n\nStrike uses the Lightning Network to make digital payments faster, cheaper, and more accessible, particularly in countries with a high number of unbanked individuals. With Send Globally, dollars are converted into bitcoin, sent via the Lightning Network to a third-party partner in the recipient's country, then converted into local currency and sent directly to the recipient's bank or mobile money account. This eliminates the need for both the sender and recipient to worry about bitcoin's tax treatment, dollar volatility or custody implications.\n\n\u201cRemittances are a broken system and Strike delivers an incredibly empowering experience for people to send money around the world in nearly an instant,\u201d Jack Mallers, founder and CEO of Strike commented. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Pouch.ph to advance financial inclusion and bring fast, low-cost cross-border payments via the Lightning Network to the Philippines. Our technology allows us to both improve on the existing cross-border experience and include those that have previously been excluded by legacy payment rails.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Magazine was fortunate enough to interview Mallers on the development, which can be viewed below:\n\nSend Globally was launched in December 2022 starting with transfers from the U.S. to Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana. CoinCorner has also partnered with Pouch.ph to enable remittances for European customers.\n\n\n\nWith the integration of Pouch.ph and Strike, the cross-border payment experience has been revolutionized and has further empowered people to easily send money to their loved ones back home. Lightning will continue to expand into more markets with more partners to provide better payment services to communities around the world.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Is the Bitcoin 4-Year Market Cycle Real? - Benzinga",
        "content": "Happy birthday, Bitcoin! On Jan. 3, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain reached the age of fourteen. In some ways, 2009 seems like a lifetime ago and in other ways like it was yesterday. After 14 years, Bitcoin, the first successful cryptocurrency, is still the king, and, as king, the rest of the crypto market follows it.\n\nThroughout Bitcoin\u2019s short history, its price has experienced enormous swings to new all-time highs, followed by retracements that take back most of the gains. Studying the four Bitcoin market cycles, it becomes clear that other than the first cycle, the others are relatively consistent regarding timing.\n\nThis trend is especially true of the last two cycles, which are very close to 4 years each from peak to peak and bottom to bottom. Some have speculated that this timing results from the Bitcoin halving that occurs approximately every four years (210,000 blocks mined). The question now is: Is the Bitcoin 4-year cycle a real phenomenon or just a coincidence? And if it is real, will it continue?\n\nget started Limited Time Offer: Trade $100, Get $10 Buy $100 worth of crypto and get a $10 bonus! get started Disclosure: eToro supports the following currencies: BTC, ADA, DASH, DOGE, EOS, ETH, LTC, NEO, XLM, XTZ, TRX, ZEC. eToro USA LLC; Investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Show More\n\nDissecting Bitcoin\u2019s Market Cycles\n\nFor clarity, this article defines a market cycle from one bear market bottom to the next.\n\n2010 to 2011 Market Cycle\n\nThe first accurate Bitcoin price tracking occurred in July 2010. By October, Bitcoin's price started to rise and peaked on June 8, 2011, at $31.90. The price began to fall over the next five months and bottomed at $2.01 on Nov. 19, 2011. This first cycle was the shortest of all the cycles to date.\n\n2011 to 2015 Market Cycle\n\nCycle #2 began at the 2011 bear market bottom on November 19, after which the price bounced higher almost immediately. After the bounce, there was a six-month period of consolidation. After BTC broke out of the consolidation, it peaked at over $268 on April 10, 2013; a 76% drop followed that peak.\n\nBTC recovered almost immediately and hit a bull market peak of $1,177 on Nov. 30, 2013. An 86% drop followed that peak; the bottom was hit on Jan. 14, 2015.\n\n2015 to 2018 Market Cycle\n\nThe third cycle began at the 2015 bear market bottom on January 14. For the first 9 \u00bd months, the price of Bitcoin accumulated in a range of about $100. After the price of Bitcoin broke out of the accumulation range, it re-tested the range once before moving higher.\n\nThe move higher culminated in the bull market peak at just under $20,000 on Dec. 17, 2017. Once again, a price drop of 84% followed the peak and the bottom was hit almost one year later, on Dec. 15, 2018.\n\n2018 to 2022 Market Cycle\n\nThe fourth cycle began on Dec. 15, 2018, and after about four months of accumulation, the price of Bitcoin broke out in a dramatic fashion. Over the next three months, the price of Bitcoin increased by over 200% and hit a high of $13,831 on June 26, 2019.\n\nOver the remainder of the year, Bitcoin\u2019s price slowly dropped but still finished up about 90% for the year. The start of 2020 saw a 45% increase in the price of Bitcoin, which peaked in mid-February. That was followed by the COVID crash, which bottomed in mid-March.\n\nThe recovery from the COVID crash was swift and eventually led to the next bull market. This bull market was reminiscent of the 2013 bull market. After pushing higher throughout much of 2020, the price of Bitcoin peaked on April 14, 2021. This peak was followed by a 55% pullback that bottomed on July 20.\n\nOver the next month, the price of Bitcoin increased by over 134%, which led to the ultimate bull market peak on Nov. 10 at $69,000. Bitcoin\u2019s price immediately began to drop and just over a year later, on Nov. 21, 2022, it hit what appears to be the bottom at $15,495.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) Entire Price History - Weekly Chart\n\nBy zooming out and looking at the entire price history of Bitcoin, you can calculate the timing of each market cycle. In the chart above, the green vertical lines mark the bull market peaks and the time intervals between them. The yellow dashed lines mark the bear market bottoms, with the time intervals between them.\n\nTake note of the timing of the last two market cycles. They are close to a four-year cycle, from one peak to the next and from bottom to bottom. Another interesting observation is the time of year when the peaks and bottoms occur.\n\nOther than the very first peak in 2011, all the others occurred in November, December or January. November has the most with two peaks and two bottoms, assuming that Nov. 21, 2022, marks the bottom for this bear market. Is this timing a coincidence, or is there a reason behind it?\n\nAnother observation is that each bear market low is higher than the previous low. Will that continue? Below is another chart showing the entire price history of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) Entire Price History - Weekly Chart\n\nThe vertical lines on this chart mark each peak (green), when each halving occurred (red) and the date one year before each halving (yellow). The percentage increase in price is then measured between the vertical lines for each cycle. It is calculated for the year leading up to the halving and from the halving to the following peak.\n\nIt is clear that with each successive cycle, the percentage increase in price for the year leading up to the halving is declining. The same pattern is evident from the halving to the following peak. Again, with Bitcoin\u2019s short history, it is unclear whether or not this pattern will continue. Visually, it is easy to see the diminishing returns with each successive cycle.\n\nTiming for Bitcoin Bottoms - Halvings - Peaks\n\nThis chart shows how consistent the timing is from the bottom to the halving and from the halving to the following peak. The next halving is estimated to occur on March 28, 2024. Just for fun, extrapolating the data from the other cycles puts the next bull market peak in late October 2025.\n\nIs there a meaning behind these patterns? Will these patterns continue? Can you even call these patterns with the limited amount of data? So many questions and because no one has a crystal ball, all people can do is watch as the next Bitcoin market cycle unfolds. It should also be noted that because many altcoins follow Bitcoin\u2019s price action, there is also a crypto market cycle.\n\nWill Bitcoin\u2019s 4-Year Market Cycle Continue or Evolve?\n\nAnother important question is how the changing investor demographics will affect the Bitcoin market cycle. Over the last couple of years, the number of institutional investors has been increasing. The number of corporations holding Bitcoin has been growing as well. As more regulation is brought into the sector, institutional investment will grow.\n\nThe days of only retail investors and traders buying Bitcoin are over. Will this trend affect Bitcoin\u2019s market cycle? As investor demographics change, the steep bear market pullbacks may become shallower. If this does occur, it will affect not only Bitcoin but also the entire crypto market cycle.\n\nRetail buyers will come in late and panic sell when the market turns against them. As they become a minor part of the overall investor pool, their effect on Bitcoin\u2019s price will diminish.\n\nInstitutional investors and corporations will be more likely to hold onto their Bitcoin. And depending on their average cost, they may even hold through bear markets. Together, these changes may significantly impact Bitcoin\u2019s market cycle.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin\u2019s Current Market Condition?\n\nThe bottom of the 2018 bear market occurred two days shy of the one-year anniversary of the 2017 bull market peak. The low set on Nov. 21, 2022, at $15,476 (Binance), is one year and eleven days after the bull market peak on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nIt may be too early to say that Nov. 21, 2022, is the bottom for this bear market. But, after 49 days of sideways price movement, Bitcoin\u2019s price surged over 50% to just under $24,000. The likelihood of that being the bottom continues to increase.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Daily Chart\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s history, a macroeconomic environment like the past 12 months has not occurred. Inflation has soared to levels not seen in 40 years. To combat this, central banks worldwide increased interest rates to slow economic growth. The unknown now is whether this policy will result in recessions in some countries or worse worldwide.\n\nA severe recession would drop markets worldwide and most likely put downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin. If a severe downturn can be avoided, 2023 should be a year of recovery for BTC. January has only a few days left and Bitcoin is up about 45% for the month, which marks an excellent start to the year.\n\nHistorically, the meat of bull markets has occurred after each halving. The next halving is estimated for the end of March 2024, so if this cycle follows past cycles, the next macro bull market should begin soon after.\n\nMark Twain is credited with saying, \u201cHistory never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme.\u201d This does appear to be true for Bitcoin\u2019s market cycles. Whether or not rhyming continues is anyone's guess. What is becoming more evident is that with each day inches closer to the most exciting time in crypto. Will you be prepared for liftoff?\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin\n\nNow that you know how to use Bitcoin market cycles to get an idea of what the future holds for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general, here's how to buy Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is the largest and most popular crypto in the world, it is offered by essentially all crypto exchanges. Some of the best exchanges that offer Bitcoin trading are eToro, WeBull, Gemini, Binance, Uphold and HYCM. Once you buy your Bitcoin, you should keep the coins off of the exchange to custody your crypto yourself for the best security. Ledger hardware wallets are all you need to keep your crypto safe and they support more than 1,800 cryptos including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple and all ERC-20 tokens."
