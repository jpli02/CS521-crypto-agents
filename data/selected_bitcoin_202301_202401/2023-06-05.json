        "content": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year.\n\nCryptocurrency prices dropped Monday after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, with violating securities laws.\n\nBitcoin fell 5.5% to $25,662.50, its lowest level since March, according to Coin Metrics.\n\nEther slid 5.1% to $1,807.79. Binance Coin , a token used to pay transaction and trading fees on the Binance exchange, tumbled 9.5%.\n\nThe declines came after the SEC alleged Binance and its co-founder, Changpeng Zhao, comingled billions of dollars of investor funds with their own and violated securities laws. The complaint follows a similar one against Binance from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission earlier this year.\n\n\"Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume so it's no surprise that the market is responding the way it is to the news,\" Sam Callahan, lead analyst at bitcoin services company Swan Bitcoin, told CNBC. \"Any regulatory action against a major player in the cryptocurrency space creates uncertainty and leads to increased market volatility in the short term.\"\n\n\"However, such volatility is often temporary, and prices may recover once the market absorbs the news,\" he added. \"Long term this can be seen as a healthy development for the ecosystem as bad actors are cleansed out, and capital flows out of cryptocurrencies with significant regulatory risk and into bitcoin.\"\n\nThe suit is the latest development in this year's crackdown on the crypto industry by U.S. regulators. Since January, the SEC has charged Kraken, Genesis and Gemini Trust with offering unregistered securities to investors and has warned Coinbase of potential securities charges.\n\nBitcoin last week capped its worst month of trading since November, finishing May down 7.9% after trading in a narrow range of between $26,000 and $28,000. Technical analysts see $25,200 as the key level to watch for bitcoin on the downside."

        "title": "Proposed 30% Tax on Bitcoin Mining Energy Use Dies in U.S. Debt Deal - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nA tax proposed by the Biden Administration to curtail Bitcoin mining in the United States has apparently been shelved indefinitely, thanks to the terms of a compromise over the U.S. debt ceiling.\n\nThe tax in question was known as the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax, and it was originally made public by the White House in early May as part of a broader budget proposal. Primarily targeting the environmental impact of the crypto industry, DAME as originally envisioned would have required all crypto miners in the United States to pay a tax equivalent to 30% of the cost of the electricity these companies use. Such a tax would not only be devastating to a business that relies on cheap power costs, but would also completely ignore the reality that a huge number of bitcoin miners today are reliant on renewable energy.\n\nHowever, this plan, and indeed all the White House\u2019s proposals for economic functioning, have been dramatically hampered by the latest round of negotiation over the U.S. debt ceiling. In essence, without a vote of confidence from an embittered Congress, the federal government would have defaulted on its loans, creating a crisis for the dollar. To continue the normal functioning of the global reserve currency, a deal was reached in late May that largely focused on concessions over economic policy. It\u2019s thanks to this deal that the DAME act seems well and truly shuttered.\n\nThe crypto community has generally reacted to this news with celebration, as some of the largest mining firms are seeing massive stock rallies on top of a year that has already been successful. For the moment, it does not seem like there is political will to carry out an attack on Bitcoin from this angle.\n\nJust because this plan has failed, though, does not mean that crypto miners are safe from similar taxes on other fronts. Considering that this proposal collapsed over the federal government\u2019s spending, Bitcoiners should be wary of the White House\u2019s arguments that the DAME tax would generate billions for federal coffers. In other words, it seems very likely that similar attacks on crypto mining will be proposed in the future, possibly in a reworked fashion to seem more economically valuable or otherwise accompanied by increased efforts to link crypto mining and climate change.\n\nFor now, DAME failed in the same month it was proposed, and the immediate threat to Bitcoin has passed. The speed of this victory should remind the world of how far cryptocurrency has come in the last few years; an economic maverick has seen enough acceptance within the halls of power that it now has no shortage of friends in the U.S. House and Senate. As the crypto industry continues to grow and represent economic freedom for millions of people worldwide, it seems safe to say that it\u2019s smart to bet on Bitcoin.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell almost 6% and Ether lost 5% in a broad market fall by all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies on Tuesday morning in Asia after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao on charges of securities violations. The BNB token issued by Binance was the biggest loser with a drop of more than 10% in the past 24 hours.\n\nTop 10 cryptos slide\n\nBitcoin dropped 5.66% over the last 24 hours to US$25,730 at 7:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, bringing losses over the past seven days to 7.23%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEther fell 4.91% in the same period to US$1,808, and logged a 4.56% weekly loss.\n\nBNB skidded 10.21% to US$275.17 in the last 24 hours, losing 11.61% over the past week.\n\nThe SEC on Monday filed 13 charges against Binance, alleging the exchange made unregistered and unlawful offers and sales of its BNB and BUSD tokens. The SEC also alleged that Binance did not register Binance.com as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency.\n\nIn response to the SEC lawsuit, Binance said in a Tuesday statement that it intends to defend its platform \u201cvigorously.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission\u2019s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry,\u201d Binance said.\n\nCryptocurrencies traded on the Binance exchange, including BNB, BUSD, Solana, Cardano\u2019s ADA, Polygon\u2019s MATIC, are securities and require registration and regulation, according to the SEC suit.\n\nSolana dropped 9.52% over the past 24 hours, with ADA falling 7.73% and MATIC losing 7.64%.\n\n\u201cThe total crypto market cap is down,\u201d Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock, told Forkast on Tuesday morning in Asia. \u201cThe fact that the news doesn\u2019t come as a shock doesn\u2019t mean that it was priced in, apparently.\u201d\n\nIn a Monday tweet, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in \u201can extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure and calculated evasion of the law.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIn response, Zhao tweeted: \u201cWonder if he ever reads the comments under his post, from the consumers he is [supposed] to protect.\u201d\n\nWonder if he ever reads the comments under his post, from the consumers he is suppose to protect. https://t.co/xQjC872GsD \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) June 5, 2023\n\nAccording to d\u2019Anethan, the SEC\u2019s legal action is not a surprise considering the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission had earlier filed a lawsuit against Binance for alleged violations of trading rules for derivatives.\n\nHowever, traders see the lawsuit as extremely bearish and it\u2019s shaking up the market, he said.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 4.6% to US$1.09 trillion in the 24 hours through to 8:30am Hong Kong, while trading volume surged 118% to more than US$48 billion.\n\nApple headset bumps Binance in NFT market\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged down 0.17% to 3,295.91 in the 24 hours to 9:20 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance \u201chasn\u2019t had an impact on NFTs yet, but it likely will,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, said on Tuesday. \u201cIt has already impacted crypto, and usually NFTs lag behind just a bit.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. overnight, Apple Inc. unveiled its highly-anticipated mixed-reality headset Vision Pro. While priced at a hefty US$3,499, the headset has got the NFT industry excited about its potential application in metaverse developments.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s headset is really all the NFT spaces was talking about today and rightfully so,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cReally, it\u2019s the single most important thing to happen to NFTs since CryptoPunks, even though Apple didn\u2019t mention NFTs or the metaverse once in their reveal of the Vision Pro.\u201d\n\nS\u00e9bastien Borget, co-founder and chief operating officer of decentralized gaming giant The Sandbox, said in a Tuesday interview with Forkast that Apple\u2019s headset is \u201copening a big field of opportunity\u201d for metaverse developments.\n\n\u201cThis has the highest chance of becoming a game changer versus everything we\u2019ve seen so far over the past five years in this field \u2026 allowing people to interact with their virtual assets in the physical world.\u201d\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 5.64% over the last 24 hours to US$25.75 million, and gained 90.84% in the past week. Sales on the Bitcoin network climbed 4.17% to US$3.16 million, but recorded a 11.87% weekly decline.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Azuki remained the two most-sold Ethereum collections. BAYC had the biggest sales in the past 24 hours of US$7.26 million, followed by Azuki\u2019s US$2.65 million.\n\nDMarket, a Mythos blockchain-based collection of gaming NFTs, was the third most-sold collection over the past 24 hours with an 11.49% rise in sales to US$1.52 million.\n\nCoinbase shares hit by Binance\n\nImage: Coinbase\n\nShares of Coinbase, the largest crypto trading platform in the U.S., dropped 9.05% on Monday following the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance. Shares of MicroStrategy, the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, fell 8.53%.\n\nU.S. stock futures also moved marginally lower as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.05%, S&P 500 futures fell 0.04%. Nasdaq Futures fell 0.09%.\n\nCoinbase has its own legal battle with the SEC. In March, the SEC alleged Coinbase violated investor protection laws and threatened enforcement action against the exchange. Coinbase argued back in April that the SEC\u2019s move appeared to be undermining its own role as the monitor of companies registering to sell shares to the public.\n\nCoinbase has also requested a court to compel the SEC to publicly respond to the exchange\u2019s July 2022 petition asking for clearer crypto regulation guidelines.\n\nOn the regulation front, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, tweeted on Monday that he will testify on Tuesday before the House Committee on Agriculture on the need for clear crypto rules and on the Digital Asset Market Structure discussion draft released Friday.\n\n\u201cThe US is falling behind,\u201d Grewal tweeted. \u201cWe cannot afford to ignore crypto while other markets take advantage of our absence, developing rules and regulations that enable the industry to thrive and risk sending jobs, investment, and technological leadership overseas.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Who Has The Bitcoin? A Closer Look At The Bitcoin Supply - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The article below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.\n\nWho Holds The Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s public ledger comes with a unique level of transparency that includes significant information detailing where the bitcoin supply lives. With the help of address tracking, public announcements and some estimation across data sources, we can get a sense of where nearly 47% of total bitcoin supply is today. A considerable portion of bitcoin\u2019s 21-million supply is estimated to be lost, which includes Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s coins. There\u2019s useful data from both Glassnode and Chainalysis to suggest that nearly 4 million bitcoin has been lost.\n\nOther large amounts of bitcoin are on exchanges, in the Grayscale trust, or in bitcoin miners\u2019 wallets. Swaths of bitcoin have been accumulated by the likes of MicroStrategy, and more recently Tether. Some 5,500 bitcoin are locked up on the Lightning Network, while other sums exist as wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) on blockchains besides Bitcoin.\n\nMost bitcoin estimates can be tracked on a routine basis when looking at examples, like known U.S. government-associated on-chain addresses from various bitcoin seizures, or when analyzing monthly production updates from public bitcoin miners, while other holding details can be much harder to come by. A private institution may have indicated bitcoin holdings years ago, but isn\u2019t required to publicly announce updates of their stash. Other instances include uncertainty around government holdings. China may have 194,000 bitcoin from seizure, but it\u2019s difficult to verify if this number is current.\n\nAll that said, the below chart is a rough cut of available data that can be expanded upon and improved for better accuracy across different groups. These figures come from on-chain forensics, public SEC filings and balance sheet attestations.\n\nBitcoin holdings separated by type of entity.\n\nOf the 2.3 million of bitcoin on exchanges, the majority resides on Binance and Coinbase. This wouldn\u2019t include bitcoin in investment custody products like Grayscale and Coinbase Custody, for example. Binance\u2019s share of bitcoin on exchanges has risen from under 10% in 2019 up to 30% today. The company is estimated to have nearly 700,000 bitcoin on their platform, which can predominantly be attributed to their derivatives marketplace dominance and their international presence, whereas Coinbase is mainly a spot exchange with a heavy U.S. presence.\n\nThe percent share of exchanges' bitcoin balances.\n\nOver time, the amount of circulating bitcoin supply on exchanges has reached 17.5% of circulating supply, reaching its peak in March 2020 before declining to just 11.89%. We suspect that the trend of declining bitcoin on exchanges as a percentage of circulating supply will continue as bitcoin distributes across an increased number of global adopters, thanks to sophisticated personal custody solutions becoming more mainstream and robust as time goes on.\n\nA little less than 12% of circulating bitcoin is held on exchanges.\n\nIn absolute terms, there has never been this level of long-term holders in bitcoin. In relative terms, the only two times in history with a larger share of long-term holder coins is in 2009 before bitcoin had an exchange rate, and in the depths of the 2015 bear market. With so much of the supply off the market, sell-side pressure in the interim can result in large price adjustments to the downside, since many market participants are partaking in more of a passive role.\n\nLong-term holders' percentage of circulating supply is growing.\n\nWe can also look at bitcoin\u2019s illiquid supply to quantify holder dynamics. The term \u201cilliquid supply\u201d refers to bitcoin that are held by entities that rarely sell, meaning these coins are not readily available for trading. To quantify this, an entity's bitcoin holdings are deemed illiquid if less than 25% of its received bitcoins have been spent, liquid if 25% to 75% have been spent, and highly liquid if over 75% have been spent.\n\nIn the post-2016 halving era, bitcoin\u2019s illiquid supply as a percentage of circulating supply is at its highest level, with holder accumulation taking coins off the market faster than miner issuance can distribute them.\n\nAs of this April 2023, bitcoin\u2019s illiquid supply surpassed 15,000,000 coins.\n\nA large majority of bitcoin's supply is illiquid.\n\nIlliquid bitcoin supply has trended upward since 2016.\n\nThe trend is clear: Bitcoin continues to distribute into more hands, with a greater concentration of supply shifting from entities holding large amounts of bitcoin \u2014 balances of 1,000-10,000 BTC, 10,000-100,000 BTC, and greater than 100,000 BTC \u2014 to entities holding balances of 10 BTC or less.\n\nEntities' bitcoin balances of over 1,000 bitcoin has been trending down since 2011.\n\nBitcoin balances of less than 10 bitcoin has been growing for over a decade, meaning supply is getting distributed more evenly.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that entities holding large amounts of bitcoin, particularly those with 10,000-plus BTC, are likely managing keys for thousands or even millions of users, exchanges being an obvious example. This is often a classic source of mischaracterization and misinformation when people make claims regarding a lack of wealth distribution of bitcoin. Yes, there are clumps of addresses with large holdings of bitcoin, but this is like claiming that one corporation owns 14% of all U.S. dollars in the commercial banking system. While JPMorgan Chase has $2.4 trillion out of $17.1 trillion of deposits in domestic banks and the deposits are a liability of JPMorgan, in actuality, they are custodied for millions of unique individuals and businesses.\n\nThe key difference \u2014 aside from the legal versus cryptographic ownership structure \u2014 is the fact that bitcoin\u2019s ownership structure, the UTXO set, is much more transparent and easily auditable. This makes it easy for anyone to look at the data and make informed claims about bitcoin\u2019s supply concentration.\n\nFinal Note\n\nBitcoin has been successful in attracting a broad spectrum of holders, from individuals to corporations, private entities and even nation-states. As evidenced by increasing retail ownership and historically high levels of long-term holders, it\u2019s clear that bitcoin's supply is getting distributed more evenly across this vast array of adopters. This trend is further reinforced by a declining amount of bitcoin held on exchanges and an increasing illiquid supply.\n\nMoving forward, we anticipate these trends of increased distribution and declining concentration to continue, as bitcoin\u2019s 21,000,000 hard capped supply is divided up between the world\u2019s individuals, institutions, corporations and nation states.\n\nThat concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO.
