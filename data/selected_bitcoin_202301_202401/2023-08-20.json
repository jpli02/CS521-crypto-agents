        "content": "Bitcoin's back to its volatile ways after its big move down late last week \u2014 but not for the reason investors expected. Volatility has been a defining characteristic of bitcoin in both positive and negative ways, but it's been almost completely absent from the market for several weeks. That was, until Thursday night, when the cryptocurrency suddenly tumbled as much as 9% . Aside from the mismanaged crypto lenders (and FTX) that plagued the crypto market in 2022, the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting rate hiking campaign played a big part in bitcoin's downward price pressure. Though investors had started to think the Fed was done with rate hikes for the rest of this year, the minutes of the latest FOMC meeting released Wednesday showed central bank sees \"upside risks\" to inflation that could lead to more increases. That's when bitcoin's decline really began, and the volatility could linger, according to Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian investment fund manager 3iQ. \"The volatility will have a persistence if we're going to stay here at an elevated real rate environment,\" he told CNBC. \"We're not surprised when we see a stepwise function in yields, 25 basis points in a month to 4.25% on the 10-year \u2013 the highest in the long time. Mortgage rates are higher, the next hanging chads to drop is credit risk defaults.\" BTC.CM= 5D mountain Bitcoin (BTC) began falling after the July FOMC meeting minutes were released Wednesday. Market observers typically monitor where the benchmark fed funds rate is hovering, but \"real rates\" account for the difference between nominal rates and inflation indicators. Even if the Fed doesn't raise interest rates anymore, the crypto space seems more focused now on real rates and keeping them elevated to fight inflation. \"These are just normal developments that happen when we're stepping into a new rate regime,\" he said. \"This isn't like bad behavior from last year. The centralized, unregistered, unregulated bad actors and fraudsters hiding offshore entities \u2013 that was last year.\" A 'healthy bloodletting' Investors expected volatility would return when regulatory headwinds turned into tailwinds \u2014 by seeing an SEC-approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund or clear crypto legislation enacted in Congress. That would also usher in the return of liquidity, which left the market after the banking crisis in the spring, and help create a better functioning market. \"This is a healthy bloodletting of some of the active trade management and a reminder that we don't have liquidity and of why we need regulation,\" Connors said. \"We need to have more active engaged market makers in this space to absorb and provide liquidity with guidance from developed markets like the U.S.\" Crypto needs regulatory clarity so institutional buyers can own crypto assets, Connors explained, likening the situation to high-yield debt in the 1980s: It's still a core holding even though it had its own notorious bad actors that've gone away. \"The market and institutions own it. It's a stable market because you have long bias market,\" he said. \"If we get clarity \u2026 and we get the ability of institutions to just buy \u2026 then when you get these downdrafts of 10% or 15%, institutions won't rebalance their 1% to 2% holdings in bitcoin against equities, they'll add more.\" \"When Bitcoin goes up \u2026 there'll be selling into people buying it. That's a healthy ecosystem,\" he added. Having institutions with an established long core holding would act as a stabilizing force for Bitcoin, Connors added. But currently, institutions are one the sidelines until they get clarity from regulators on how they can bring crypto into their business. That's why this summer's bitcoin ETF filings from BlackRock, Fidelity and other institutions are so critical. \"Until this gets settled, capital can't go into the space to help provide that shock absorption,\" Connors said. \u2014CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed reporting."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether stable after last week's nosedive; XRP leads crypto gains; US stock futures mixed - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Monday morning in Asia to trade slightly above the US$26,000 support level, after sliding over 10% for the week. Ether also moved higher but remained below US$1,700 following last week\u2019s losses. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP led the winners, despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moving to challenge a June court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped as NFT marketplace OpenSea said it will stop enforcing creator royalties from August 31. U.S. stock futures traded flat after Wall Street logged weekly losses at close of trading Friday.\n\nBaby steps upward for cryptos after painful few days\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.28% in the last 24 hours to US$26,178.36 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, logging a weekly loss of 10.68%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency hit a two-month low of US$25,409.11 on Friday, but held position above the US$26,000 support level over the weekend.\n\nA cool-off of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype in the U.S. could be behind the retreat of the token. That\u2019s the view of James Butterfill, head of research at European alternative asset manager CoinShares.\n\n\u201cThe surge in June, spurred by BlackRock\u2019s application for SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF, led to a noticeable spike in prices,\u201d said Butterfill in a report released Friday.\n\n\u201cHowever, markets are now coming to terms with the realization that an immediate SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is unlikely. It\u2019s noteworthy that current Bitcoin prices have stabilized around levels observed before this announcement,\u201d he added.\n\nThe low volume and volatility in Bitcoin, a rise in U.S. treasury yields, as well as concerns over China\u2019s ailing economy contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s sharp weekly decline, the CoinShares report found.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for the markets in the forthcoming months presents a blend of opportunities and challenges. It\u2019s anticipated that the U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking rates further in September,\u201d Butterfill said.\n\nStory continues\n\nA dovish shift in Fed policy could provide a boost to Bitcoin\u2019s prospects, he added.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, investors are eagerly awaiting the SEC\u2019s verdict on the Grayscale ETF and BlackRock applications in September. Anticipations are that decisions on both applications might be postponed, potentially leading to investor disappointment,\u201d Butterfly said.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether moved up 0.85% to US$1,683.57 but remained 8.50% lower for the past seven days.\n\nThe U.S. SEC could approve several ETFs based on Ethereum futures by October 2023, Bloomberg reported on Friday citing unnamed sources. Investment firms Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares have all applied for Ethereum ETF licenses.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, but all posted weekly losses. Cryptocurrencies have seen a total liquidation of US$24.91 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nThat\u2019s a considerable decrease on the daily losses posted last week during a calamitous downturn in the crypto market. On Friday alone, traders liquidated over US$1 billion in cryptocurrencies, including US$851.94 million in long positions \u2014 positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise. On Monday, long position liquidations stood at US$6.89 million for the past 24 hours, according to data from crypto information platform CoinGlass.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the winners, gaining 3.96% to US$0.5408 but plunged 13.76% for the week.\n\nIn the on-going legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres on Thursday granted the SEC permission to appeal an earlier judgement in favor of Ripple Labs. That ruling in late June found that the technology firm\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws.\n\nIn a Saturday tweet, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said the SEC should not be allowed to appeal until the conclusion of the case. He said that, even if an appeal is granted, \u201cthe case should still continue and the appeal should run in parallel.\u201d\n\nYes. A party that loses on any claim or issue in their suit is entitled to appeal any adverse rulings at the conclusion of the suit. The SEC is asking for permission to appeal here because the suit is not complete yet for any party.\n\n\n\nYou can see why there would be a rule like\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) August 18, 2023\n\nRipple will have until September 1 to respond to the SEC\u2019s appeal motion.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.45% in the past 24 hours to US$1.06 trillion, while trading volume fell 13.09% to US$21.67 billion.\n\nOpenSea NFT marketplace to stop enforcing creator royalties\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.08% in the past 24 hours to 2,327.91 as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, and fell 5.94% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum Polygon and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the index for Solana moved higher.\n\n\u201cThe catalyst for this (NFT index drop) was OpenSea\u2019s decision to get rid of royalties,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, in a YouTube video uploaded Sunday.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, announced on Thursday it would stop enforcing creator royalty fees, making them optional. The change will take effect from August 31. The platform will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.\n\n\u201c(The mandatory royalty fee on OpenSea) was meant to empower creators with greater control over their Web3 business models, but it required the buy-in of everyone in the Web3 ecosystem, and unfortunately that has not happened,\u201d wrote OpenSea in the announcement.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s move received criticism from commentators. In a tweet Friday, Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and an investor in OpenSea, described the decision as a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that would hurt the industry.\n\nNot collecting and paying royalties on NFT sales is a HUGE mistake by @opensea. It diminished trust in the platform and hurts the industry. And I say this as an @opensea investor @DevinFinzer \u2014 Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 18, 2023\n\nYuga Labs, the creator of NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), responded to the news in a tweet Saturday saying it will gradually wind down its support for OpenSea. \u201cYuga believes in protecting creator royalties so creators are properly compensated for their work,\u201d the company said.\n\nOn @opensea's decision to sunset their Operator Filter. pic.twitter.com/ahc155WWkX \u2014 Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) August 18, 2023\n\n\u201cWhat I think will happen is they either reverse their decision, or Yuga Labs may end up launching their own NFT marketplace,\u201d said Forkast Labs\u2019 Petscher on Sunday. While the impact of the decision is only just being felt, he added, it will \u201cchange the landscape of NFTs.\u201d\n\nTotal NFT trading volume gained 15.60% in the past 24 hours to US$14.76 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana and Polygon blockchains all logged increases, while Cardano\u2019s volume dipped.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based BAYC saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, which rose 45.30% to US$2.02 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Polygon-based DraftKings ranked as the second and third largest collections by 24-hour trading volume.\n\nIn terms of single NFT sales, BAYC #8585 sold at over US$255,000 on Sunday, making it the most expensive NFT traded in the past 24 hours. However, its former holder purchased the NFT at over US$1 million in October 2022.\n\n\u201cThis seller took a huge loss on this NFT,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThat explains the rising average sale price but also the declining profits.\u201d\n\nChina policy stimulus lacks punch\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed on Friday and booked losses for the week.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes traded mixed on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng logged losses, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved up.\n\nIn the U.S., investors await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed\u2019s annual summit is attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell\u2019s speech could provide insights into the Fed\u2019s thinking on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cWe view the event as a good opportunity for Powell to start laying the ground for the next step in the Fed\u2019s policy guidance: no longer focused on how many hikes to expect, but rather on rates remaining \u2018higher for longer,'\u201d analysts at Canadian investment bank TD Securities said in a note viewed by Reuters.\n\nIn July, the Fed raised the interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% \u2014 the highest level since January 2001. Powell said in a statement following the decision that the U.S. central bank will \u201ctake a data-dependent approach\u201d in determining its future monetary policies. It did not indicate if there are more hikes in the cards or how long the Fed would keep up its tightening cycle.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 11.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.\n\nU.S. data to watch in the week ahead includes U.S. chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s second-quarter earnings report, as well as S&P Global\u2019s purchasing manager indexes (PMI). Both are set for release Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s central bank cut its one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.45% from 3.55% on Monday morning. However, it kept the five-year LPR unchanged at 4.2%, according to the state media Xinhua News Agency.\n\nThe stimulus measure was smaller than the analyst expectation of two 15-basis-point cuts to both the one-year and five-year rates. Commentators said China\u2019s central bank may need to act more decisively to soothe growing fears of a recession.\n\n\u201cUntil more forceful policy responses are made available to backstop the contagion risk, we believe Chinese stocks will settle in a lower trading range than we previously envisaged,\u201d Goldman equity strategists wrote in a note viewed by Bloomberg.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

That ruling in late June found that the technology firm\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws.\n\nIn a Saturday tweet, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said the SEC should not be allowed to appeal until the conclusion of the case. He said that, even if an appeal is granted, \u201cthe case should still continue and the appeal should run in parallel.\u201d\n\nYes. A party that loses on any claim or issue in their suit is entitled to appeal any adverse rulings at the conclusion of the suit. The SEC is asking for permission to appeal here because the suit is not complete yet for any party.\n\n\n\nYou can see why there would be a rule like\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) August 18, 2023\n\nRipple will have until September 1 to respond to the SEC\u2019s appeal motion.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.45% in the past 24 hours to US$1.06 trillion, while trading volume fell 13.09% to US$21.67 billion.\n\nOpenSea NFT marketplace to stop enforcing creator royalties\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.08% in the past 24 hours to 2,327.91 as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, and fell 5.94% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum Polygon and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the index for Solana moved higher.\n\n\u201cThe catalyst for this (NFT index drop) was OpenSea\u2019s decision to get rid of royalties,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, in a YouTube video uploaded Sunday.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, announced on Thursday it would stop enforcing creator royalty fees, making them optional. The change will take effect from August 31. The platform will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.\n\n\u201c(The mandatory royalty fee on OpenSea) was meant to empower creators with greater control over their Web3 business models, but it required the buy-in of everyone in the Web3 ecosystem, and unfortunately that has not happened,\u201d wrote OpenSea in the announcement.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s move received criticism from commentators. In a tweet Friday, Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and an investor in OpenSea, described the decision as a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that would hurt the industry.\n\nNot collecting and paying royalties on NFT sales is a HUGE mistake by @opensea. It diminished trust in the platform and hurts the industry. And I say this as an @opensea investor @DevinFinzer \u2014 Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 18, 2023\n\nYuga Labs, the creator of NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), responded to the news in a tweet Saturday saying it will gradually wind down its support for OpenSea. \u201cYuga believes in protecting creator royalties so creators are properly compensated for their work,\u201d the company said.\n\nOn @opensea's decision to sunset their Operator Filter. pic.twitter.com/ahc155WWkX \u2014 Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) August 18, 2023\n\n\u201cWhat I think will happen is they either reverse their decision, or Yuga Labs may end up launching their own NFT marketplace,\u201d said Forkast Labs\u2019 Petscher on Sunday. While the impact of the decision is only just being felt, he added, it will \u201cchange the landscape of NFTs.\u201d\n\nTotal NFT trading volume gained 15.60% in the past 24 hours to US$14.76 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana and Polygon blockchains all logged increases, while Cardano\u2019s volume dipped.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based BAYC saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, which rose 45.30% to US$2.02 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Polygon-based DraftKings ranked as the second and third largest collections by 24-hour trading volume.\n\nIn terms of single NFT sales, BAYC #8585 sold at over US$255,000 on Sunday, making it the most expensive NFT traded in the past 24 hours. However, its former holder purchased the NFT at over US$1 million in October 2022.\n\n\u201cThis seller took a huge loss on this NFT,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThat explains the rising average sale price but also the declining profits.\u201d\n\nChina policy stimulus lacks punch\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed on Friday and booked losses for the week.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes traded mixed on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng logged losses, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved up.\n\nIn the U.S., investors await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed\u2019s annual summit is attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell\u2019s speech could provide insights into the Fed\u2019s thinking on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cWe view the event as a good opportunity for Powell to start laying the ground for the next step in the Fed\u2019s policy guidance: no longer focused on how many hikes to expect, but rather on rates remaining \u2018higher for longer,'\u201d analysts at Canadian investment bank TD Securities said in a note viewed by Reuters.\n\nIn July, the Fed raised the interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% \u2014 the highest level since January 2001. Powell said in a statement following the decision that the U.S. central bank will \u201ctake a data-dependent approach\u201d in determining its future monetary policies. It did not indicate if there are more hikes in the cards or how long the Fed would keep up its tightening cycle.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 11.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.\n\nU.S. data to watch in the week ahead includes U.S. chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s second-quarter earnings report, as well as S&P Global\u2019s purchasing manager indexes (PMI). Both are set for release Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s central bank cut its one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.45% from 3.55% on Monday morning. However, it kept the five-year LPR unchanged at 4.2%, according to the state media Xinhua News Agency.\n\nThe stimulus measure was smaller than the analyst expectation of two 15-basis-point cuts to both the one-year and five-year rates. Commentators said China\u2019s central bank may need to act more decisively to soothe growing fears of a recession.\n\n\u201cUntil more forceful policy responses are made available to backstop the contagion risk, we believe Chinese stocks will settle in a lower trading range than we previously envisaged,\u201d Goldman equity strategists wrote in a note viewed by Bloomberg.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"
