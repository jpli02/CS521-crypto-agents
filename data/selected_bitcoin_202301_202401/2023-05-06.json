        "title": "Bitcoin trader eyes $63K BTC price for new Bollinger Bands 'breakout' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) could be set for historic gains thanks to a simple trend line breakout, a popular trader hopes.\n\nIn a Twitter discussion on May 5, Titan of Crypto flagged a rare bull signal on the Bollinger Bands indicator for the Bitcoin monthly chart.\n\nBitcoin price may see \u201cinexorable breakout\u201d\n\nBTC price action currently impacts sentiment in different ways across various timeframes. While observers are unsure about short-term moves, the consensus remains that Bitcoin\u2019s upside mainly lies ahead as the block subsidy halving approaches.\n\nWhen tracking what comes next, however, it may be enough to look at past halving cycles, specifically, volatility.\n\nAs Titan of Crypto notes, Bollinger Bands on monthly timeframes are setting up a repeat of a breakout event that has occurred only once in each cycle.\n\nIn the two previous instances shown on an accompanying chart from 2016 and 2019, BTC/USD broke through into the upper section of the Bollinger Band channel to see significant gains.\n\nBollinger Bands are a key volatility indicator across price timeframes. They revolve around a 20-period simple moving average (SMA) functioning as a midline, with two standard deviations above and below representing the channel.\n\nThese bands expand and contract with volatility and certain events: among them, the price coming into contact with the bands or even breaking beyond them is often considered important by traders.\n\nCurrently, the one-month BTC/USD chart shows the price attempting to break above the SMA line, which, if confirmed, would suggest a classic repeat of past bull runs.\n\nCommenting, Titan of Crypto described it as an \u201cinexorable breakout.\u201c\n\n\u201dBTC is about to break its monthly Bollinger Bands base line. And when that happens 1st target will follow inexorably,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThat would bring Bitcoin to a solid $63,500.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Titan of Crypto/ Twitter\n\nWhile not quite enough to match its current all-time high, the price target could come around the point of the halving in one year\u2019s time. How long it will need in reality remains to be seen, Titan of Crypto acknowledged.\n\nBTC price bides its time\n\nLast month, John Bollinger, the band\u2019s creator, himself argued that Bitcoin was at a crucial point on daily timeframes.\n\nRelated: Is Bitcoin overbought or oversold?

Now, however, it is heading higher toward the upper band, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart (Bitstamp) with Bollinger bands.

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin miners have received a boost in profits after the scheduled difficulty level adjustment resulted in a positive balance. This is the first time since February that the difficulty, which controls the issuance of coins on the network, has decreased. Recent data from Braiins showed that Bitcoin computing power experienced a drop of over 45+ EH/s between April 20 and 28. However, this trend has been reversed with the increase in miner profits over the last week.\n\nDespite the recovery of the hashrate to 350 EH/s, it was not sufficient to prevent a 1.45% difficulty adjustment retracement, as stated by Mempool.space. Currently, the mining difficulty level is at 48T (trillions). This change in difficulty level affects the miners\u2019 profitability, as less competition for the reward means increased estimated income for those still connected to the network.\n\nBitcoin Miners Profit As Hashprice Increases\n\nThe current price for Bitcoin hashpower rose to 0.088 USD/TH/day (88 USD/PH/day), up from 0.077 USD/TH/day (77 USD/PH/day) on May 2. This 11.49% increase over three days is a positive development for Bitcoin miners, indicating increased profitability for their operations. The hashprice is a crucial metric for calculating the profitability of a mining operation, representing the value assigned to a unit of computation in dollars per terahash or petahash per day. While the cause of the significant hashrate drop last week is uncertain, the current state of the network justifies the quick reconnection of miners.\n\nRecently, there has been increased interest in BRC-20 tokens, which are used to create memecoins, leading to network congestion in Bitcoin within a few days of their release. As recently reported, this could be a possible factor in the hashrate drop. As a result of this high activity on the network, the fees are now making up 12.4% of the miners\u2019 revenue.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Out: Experts Predict $36,000 Target As Market Outlook Remains Positive\n\nBitcoin Commissions Rise After New Ordinals Record\n\nIn the wake of the rising interest in tokens that can be registered to Bitcoin through Ordinals, the value of transaction fees paid by Bitcoin users has surged. Within a single day, the average transaction fees have more than doubled. As per the data from Mempool.space, the current transaction fees range from 70 sat/vB to 100 sat/vB. This implies that a transaction of 140 vB (median) would require payment of almost $4 USD to get confirmed within the first few minutes.\n\nNote that the sudden interest in tokens registered through Ordinals is responsible for the backlog of transactions that need confirmation, leading to a surge in average commissions. According to Murch, a Bitcoin developer, the mempool depth has reached 104 blocks despite having 8 blocks per hour for the last six hours. The rise of Ordinals NFTs has not been without controversy, as some Bitcoin maximalists blame this trend for the increased transaction fees that have resurfaced in recent months.\n\nRelated Reading: Former DoJ Kennedy Jr, Laments on Global Financial Censorship, Shows Support For Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,000, up 2% in the last week.\n\nFeatured Image from iStock.com, charts from Braain.com, Mempool.space and Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Dash (DASH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) & Sparklo (SPRK) - Which One Is A Better Buy? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency investing, staying ahead of the game can mean the difference between making a fortune and missing out on the next big thing.\n\nToday, numerous cryptocurrencies are vying for investors\u2019 attention, but among the top contenders are Dash (DASH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Sparklo (SPRK). Knowing where to place your bets can be challenging with so many options.\n\nHowever, after careful analysis, experts agree that Sparklo (SPRK) is the clear winner regarding potential return on investment. With potential growth up to 4,000 times, it\u2019s no wonder investors are flocking to Sparklo.\n\nSparklo Presale Momentum On The Rise As Bulls Take Control\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be intrigued by Sparklo (SPRK)\u2019s incredible momentum. Though still in its presale, demand for this cryptocurrency is going through the roof. And it\u2019s easy to see why. On May 4th, the price of Sparklo (SPRK) increased by two cents with a current price of $0.019.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant jump! No wonder investors are rushing in before the second stage of the Sparklo (SPRK) presale. But what\u2019s so special about Sparklo (SPRK)? Well, its use case is simply fascinating.\n\nThrough its clever fractionalization of ownership, Sparklo (SPRK) lets you own a piece of valuable metals like gold, platinum, and silver. And transparency? Sparklo (SPRK) has that in spades.\n\nWith Sparklo\u2019s (SPRK) smart contract being audited by InterFi and locked in a 100-year liquidity lock, you can trust Sparklo\u2019s (SPRK) transparency practices. If Sparklo (SPRK)\u2019s momentum keeps up, some analysts predict it could do 4,000x.\n\nThat\u2019s something worth watching and perfect to include in a portfolio that includes both Dash (DASH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\n>>>> BUY SPARKLO TOKENS <<<\n\nDash Coin (DASH) Bearish As Investors Seek Better Returns Elsewhere\n\nDash (DASH) has been making waves in the crypto world due to its impressive use cases and widespread adoption. Its ability to facilitate private transactions at low fees has made it a highly sought-after crypto for everyday use.\n\nAdopted heavily in South America, Dash (DASH) has a strong foundation that has allowed it to remain in the upper echelon of cryptos. However, with its market cap already being substantial, analysts predict it may underperform the market.\n\nAs new crypto options emerge, analysts are looking towards up-and-coming options like Sparklo (SPRK) to outperform Dash (DASH) soon.\n\nNevertheless, Dash (DASH) remains a powerhouse in the world of cryptocurrencies, with its many benefits making it a top choice for crypto enthusiasts. Dash (DASH) adoption rate means it will remain one of the safest cryptos.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Growth Prospects As An Investment Weak\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of the most used cryptos today for business transactions. Many retailers and businesses that accept crypto do accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH). This gives Bitcoin Cash (BCH) an edge over many other cryptos.\n\nThat being said, analysts are not bullish on Bitcoin Cash (BCH), giving investors a return that they can\u2019t get from any other crypto.\n\nOn the bright side, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can diversify. While Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\u2019s large market cap suggests a limited potential for exponential growth, plenty of smaller cryptocurrencies \u2013 like Sparklo (SPRK) \u2013 offer an opportunity for significant gains.\n\nA crypto like Sparklo (SPRK) is in so high demand that some analysts expect it to do 4,000X. That\u2019s something you can\u2019t get from Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.sparklo.finance\n\nWebsite: https://sparklo.finance\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparklo_finance\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/sparklofinance\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin could hit a new record high next year, said Bob Ras, cofounder of blockchain firm Sologenic.\n\nHe cited bitcoin halving, which will reduce mining rewards and supply of the token.\n\nThe banking crisis and expectations that the Fed will start easing may also lift bitcoin, he added.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has soared more than 74% to start 2023, but the world's most popular token by market cap could more than double by next year, according to Bob Ras, cofounder of blockchain firm Sologenic.\n\nA key catalyst will be the halving process, which is when the reward for miners is cut in half. It's meant to cut the supply of tokens and historically has sparked price increases.\n\n\"When bitcoin's halving kicks in a year from now, we'll likely be well on our way past the previous all-time high,\" Ras told Insider.\n\nThat would mean bitcoin soars past the $67,000 level reached in November 2021, up from about $29,000 on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin appears to be front-running the belief that looser policy from the Federal Reserve is on the way, Ras explained.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday hiked rates for the 10th consecutive time, but Wall Street widely expects that to be the last increase of this tightening cycle.\n\nHe thinks the token's rally points to a future that is effectively a return to lower rates and more quantitative easing.\n\nTechnical indicators, such as long-term moving averages, suggest upside and momentum, he said, but it's the broader landscape that will determine its performance the rest of the year. And he wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin hits $40,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Coupled with signs of slowing [economic] growth, the changing macro picture is pointing towards a Fed that will likely soon have to cut interest rates and inject a lot of liquidity into the market,\" Ras said. \"If the Fed doesn't do this, then we could face a serious contraction, punctuated by a possible credit crunch. Either way, all roads appear to be leading to a loosening of monetary policy sooner rather than later.\"\n\nRas isn't alone in his bullishness. Standard Chartered published a recent note that said bitcoin could soar to $100,000 by the middle of next year, and Matrixport predicted that bitcoin could more than double to about $65,000 by next April.\n\nA hedge against financial turmoil\n\nAs the banking crisis that started with Silicon Valley Bank in March continues to spark contagion fears, more retail and institutional investors have been turning to bitcoin as a hedge, Ras said.\n\nThat turmoil re-emerged over the past week as regulators seized First Republic on Monday and sold the bulk of its assets to JPMorgan, triggered sell-offs at regional banks PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The banking crisis helped to cement the narrative of bitcoin serving as a key store of value that lacks the sort of counterparty risk of holding funds by way of bank deposits,\" Ras said. \"Bitcoin offers protection by way of decentralization, self-custody and a network that has never been hacked.\"\n\nBut a credit crisis poses the biggest downside risk for bitcoin, he said. In such a scenario, bitcoin as well as gold, another traditional safe-haven investment, could see a sharp decline in value.\n\n\"I'm not sure such a scenario would happen,\" Ras said, \"but it's possible and would unleash a tremendous amount of volatility, not only for bitcoin but all markets.\""

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Mixers Are a Double-Edged Sword for Anti-Money Laundering Efforts - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Why Bitcoin Mixers Are a Double-Edged Sword for Anti-Money Laundering Efforts\n\nAlthough bitcoin mixers are frequently targeted by financial regulators in relation to anti-money laundering efforts, they are also used for a range of legitimate purposes such as protecting financial privacy and avoiding nefarious transaction monitoring.\n\nBitcoin has become one of the world\u2019s most popular forms of payment due to its convenience, speed, and low transaction fees. However, as more and more people use bitcoin for everyday transactions, privacy concerns have arisen. Bitcoin transactions are pseudo-anonymous, meaning that while transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, the identities of the sender and recipient are not necessarily known. This anonymity has made bitcoin a popular choice for those who value their privacy. However, the pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin has also made it attractive to criminals who use it for illegal activities such as money laundering. Since on-chain analytics companies can easily trace any blockchain transaction, more and more crypto users prefer coin-anonymizing services such as bitcoin mixers or bitcoin tumblers.\n\nBitcoin mixers have become a popular tool for those who want to keep their financial transactions private. While the concept of bitcoin mixers may seem innocent enough, they have become a double-edged sword in the fight against money laundering. According to a report by Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company, the total value of bitcoin transferred through mixers increased from $11 million in 2022 to $67 million in 2023. This represents an increase of 500% in just one year. In this article, we will explore why bitcoin mixers are problematic for anti-money laundering efforts and how they can be used in a positive way.\n\nThe Dark Side of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nBitcoin mixers are online services that allow users to mix their bitcoins with other users\u2019 bitcoins. This process is also known as bitcoin mixing or bitcoin tumbling. The idea behind bitcoin mixing is to make it difficult for anyone to trace a bitcoin transaction back to its original owner.\n\nThis anonymity is a major problem for anti-money laundering efforts. Criminals can use bitcoin mixers to launder money by mixing their illegally obtained bitcoins with legitimate ones. The process of mixing makes it almost impossible to trace the illegal bitcoins back to their original source.\n\nAccording to a report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization that develops anti-money laundering guidelines, bitcoin mixers are one of the biggest threats to anti-money laundering efforts in the cryptocurrency space. The report states that mixers are mostly used by criminals to launder money and avoid detection by law enforcement. Although cryptocurrencies are often singled out by politicians and enforcement agencies when discussing money laundering, the reality is that crypto-related money laundering is a drop in the bucket compared to the global money laundering total.\n\nFor example, in 2021 Chainalysis estimated around US$9 billion was laundered using cryptocurrencies. In the same time period, the United Nations office on Drugs and Crime estimated total global money laundering to be at least $800 billion annually \u2013 and potentially up to $2 trillion. Even more surprising is the number of respected international banks that were fined in 2021 in relation to breaches of anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\n\nThe Positive Side of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nWhile bitcoin mixers are problematic for anti-money laundering efforts, they are also used for legitimate purposes. Many people use bitcoin mixers to protect their financial privacy and avoid potential transaction monitoring. For example, when someone buys something online using bitcoin, they may not want the seller to know their identity. By using a bitcoin mixer, they can ensure that their transaction is anonymous and cannot be traced back to them. Bitcoin mixing can help protect them from potential fraud or identity theft.\n\nBitcoin mixers are also often used by businesses to protect their financial information from competitors. If a company is making a large transaction, it may not want its competitors to know how much money it is moving. By using a bitcoin mixer, they can ensure that their transaction is private and cannot be traced back to them.\n\nAnother reason for seeking transaction privacy is political persecution. Of 205 countries and territories surveyed by Freedom House recently, in terms of their political rights and civil liberties, the NGO found 125 to be either \u2018not free\u2019 or only \u2018partly free\u2019. Political movements are costly to organise, and cutting of access to funding is a common tactic of oppressive governments.\n\nIn terms of personal security, bitcoin mixers can be used by law-abiding citizens to protect themselves from hacking and theft. By mixing their bitcoins with others, users can disguise the origin of their funds, making it more difficult for hackers to target them.\n\nTendencies to Regulate the Use of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nAs bitcoin has grown in popularity, there have been attempts by governments and regulators to bring it under their control. This has led to discussions about the regulation of bitcoin mixers, which are seen by some as only a tool for money laundering. In some countries, bitcoin mixers are currently illegal or operate in a legal gray area.\n\nFor example, in the United States, the use of bitcoin mixers is considered a violation of anti-money laundering laws, while in Japan, bitcoin mixers can only operate if they are licensed by the government. Similarly, in the European Union, bitcoin mixers are subject to anti-money laundering regulations and must comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin mixers are a double-edged sword for anti-money laundering efforts. While they can be used for illicit purposes, they also have legitimate uses in protecting financial privacy and preventing hacking and theft. It is important for governments and regulators to strike a balance between preventing illicit activity and protecting the legitimate uses of bitcoin mixers. Furthermore, the positive aspects of bitcoin mixers should not be overlooked. They are an important tool for individuals and businesses seeking to protect their financial privacy and secure their funds. The use of bitcoin mixers can help increase the adoption and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, which can lead to greater financial inclusion and economic empowerment. To fully realize the benefits of bitcoin mixers, it is important to promote transparency and collaboration between governments, regulators, and the cryptocurrency community. By working together, we can ensure that bitcoin mixers are used in a way that is responsible, legal, and beneficial for everyone. Ultimately, bitcoin mixers are an important tool in the cryptocurrency landscape that can be used for both good and bad. By recognizing their potential and working to mitigate their negative effects, we can create a safer and fairer financial system for all."
