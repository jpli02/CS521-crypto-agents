        "title": "3 Reasons to Invest in Crypto in 2023 -- and 1 Reason Not To - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that the last year has been rough for crypto.\n\nBitcoin (BTC 2.41%) and Ethereum (ETH 1.95%) are both down roughly 70% from their peaks, and Cardano and Solana have plummeted by around 90%. Those numbers are tough to stomach, and many investors have fled the crypto market in recent months.\n\nIf you're nervous about the market right now, you're not alone. But should you keep investing? There are three reasons to stick with crypto in 2023, and one reason you're better off avoiding it for now.\n\nWhy now could be a smart buying opportunity\n\n1. Prices are at rock bottom\n\nAt its peak, Bitcoin cost nearly $70,000 per token, and Ethereum was priced at close to $5,000 per token. Today, Bitcoin stands at just under $21,000, with Ethereum at roughly $1,500.\n\nIf you've been looking for a more affordable time to invest in crypto, you may not get a better chance than right now. The crypto market is essentially on clearance at the moment, and it's possible to load up on quality investments for a fraction of the price.\n\n2. The upswing could be lucrative\n\nOf course, nobody knows for certain whether the crypto market will recover. However, downturns like this aren't necessarily uncommon in this industry, and major cryptocurrencies have faced worse in the past.\n\nFor example, back in 2018, Ethereum's price fell by nearly 95% over the course of the year. If you had invested at its lowest point, you would have seen returns of nearly 4,500% over the following three years alone.\n\nAgain, it's unclear what the future holds for crypto, and we may not see another rally similar to the 2020-2021 surge. But even if cryptocurrencies don't reach their all-time highs again anytime soon, even a relatively small upswing could still be lucrative if you invest at rock-bottom prices.\n\n3. You might regret not investing\n\nCrypto is a speculative investment, so nobody -- even the experts -- knows how it will fare over the long term. While it could fail, it could also change the world.\n\nWhen you're deciding whether to invest, consider which of these options you'd regret more: investing now and losing money if crypto fails, or not investing and missing out on the investment of a lifetime if crypto succeeds.\n\nTo be clear, this doesn't mean you should go all-in and invest every dollar you have in crypto. As with any investment, it's important to buy wisely and only invest what you can afford. But for some people, it's worth risking a little money to avoid the regret of not taking this chance.\n\nWhy it may be best to avoid crypto\n\n1. You're a risk-averse investor\n\nFor all its potential, crypto also carries a significant amount of risk. At the moment, it's impossible to know whether crypto will succeed, and there's always a chance that you could lose whatever you invest. If money is tight, now may not be the best time to buy.\n\nAlso, this investment is notorious for its extreme volatility. Even in good times, it can experience nauseating ups and downs. Not all investors have the stomach for crypto, and that's OK. If you know you'd lose sleep over that level of volatility, you might be better off sticking to stocks for now.\n\nThe future of crypto is uncertain, and whether you choose to invest now will depend largely on your risk tolerance and personal preferences. But if a rebound is on the way, right now may be one of the best chances to buy."

        "title": "Stellar Blockchain: Overview, History, FAQ - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Stellar Blockchain?\n\nThe Stellar blockchain is one of the hundreds of networks that store and transmit cryptocurrencies. As bitcoin garnered headlines over the past ten years, many other virtual currencies and platforms racked up impressive gains and user bases. The stellar blockchain, with its lumens token, is one of them.\n\nIn early 2021, the value of Stellar's lumen token grew more than fivefold, from $0.13 to $0.73, before collapsing over the following year. As of early 2023, the lumen token is trading for about $0.08, according to the crypto data site CoinMarketCap.\n\nKey Takeaways The Stellar blockchain is a distributed ledger used to transmit digital currencies.\n\nThe main token of the Stellar blockchain is Stellar lumens or XLM.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain uses a consensus algorithm that is faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than that of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain was launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, who also founded Mt. Gox and co-founded Ripple.\n\nCritics say that the Stellar blockchain is centralized around the Stellar Development Foundation, which controls a large share of the lumens tokens.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Stellar Blockchain\n\nStellar's basic operation is similar to that of most decentralized payment technologies. It runs a network of decentralized servers with a distributed ledger that is updated every two to five seconds among all nodes. The most prominent distinguishing factor between Stellar and bitcoin is its consensus protocol.\n\n\n\nStellar\u2019s consensus protocol does not rely on the entire miner network to approve transactions. Instead, it uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) algorithm, which enables faster processing of transactions. This is because it uses quorum slices (or a portion of the network) to approve and validate a transaction.\n\nEach node in the Stellar network chooses another set of \u201ctrustworthy\u201d nodes. Once a transaction is approved by all nodes within this set, then it is considered approved. The shortened process has made Stellar's network extremely fast and it is said to process as many as 1,000 network operations per second.\n\nHow the Stellar Blockchain Process Works\n\nThe current process for cross-border transfers is a complicated one. It requires domestic banks to maintain accounts in foreign jurisdictions in local currencies. Their correspondent banks must operate a similar account in the original country.\n\nThe Nostro-Vostro process, as it is known, for cross-border transactions with fiat currencies is a lengthy one involving conversion and reconciliation of accounts. Because it enables simultaneous validation, Stellar\u2019s blockchain can shorten or eliminate the delays and complexity involved.\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumens cryptocurrency can also be used to provide liquidity and streamline the process. According to some reports, banks will use their own cryptocurrencies to facilitate such transfers in the future. According to David Mazi\u00e8res, a Stanford University professor and SCP creator, the protocol has \u201cmodest\u201d computing and financial requirements. This enables even organizations with minimal IT budgets, such as nonprofits, to participate in its network.\n\nHistory of Stellar Blockchain\n\nStellar was launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb (pictured), who also co-founded the cryptocurrency company Ripple and the exchange Mt. Gox. After leaving Ripple over his differences with other co-founders, McCaleb and his partner Joyce Kim launched the Stellar protocol as a fork of the Ripple codebase. Payments company Stripe provided $3 million in seed funding.\n\nStellar came into the spotlight in October 2017 after it announced a partnership with IBM. The partnership envisages the setting up of multiple currency corridors among nations in the South Pacific.\n\nThe project stated a goal of processing up to 60% of all cross-border payments in the region, which includes countries like Australia, Fiji, and Tonga. This would enable connections between small businesses, non-profits, and local banking institutions to expedite commercial transactions. For example, a farmer in Samoa would be able to connect and conduct transactions with a buyer in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2016, prominent technology consulting firm Deloitte also announced a partnership with Stellar to develop a payments app. At a conference in 2017, McCaleb confirmed that 30 banks signed up to use Stellar\u2019s blockchain for cross-border transfers.\n\nEach Stellar wallet must maintain a minimum balance in order to exist. At present, each account must maintain a base reserve of 1 XLM.\n\nConcerns About Stellar Blockchain\n\nFollowing the launch of the Stellar protocol, many investors raised alarms about the high number of lumens tokens controlled by the Stellar Development Foundation. Rather than let Stellar nodes \"mine\" new cryptocurrency, the creators of Stellar simply created 100 billion lumens tokens. The vast majority of them were assigned to the Stellar Development Foundation.\n\nAlthough these resources are ostensibly intended to fund development and adoption, some investors worry that they could be sold on the market, thereby diluting the holdings of potential investors. In order to address these concerns, the SDF intentionally destroyed 55 billion lumens tokens in 2019.\n\nThere are also concerns that the network relies on a small number of nodes, many of them controlled by the SDF. In 2019, two of those nodes unexpectedly failed, causing the Stellar blockchain to halt for over an hour.\n\nStellar Blockchain vs. Ripple\n\nStellar is an open-source payment technology that shares several similarities with Ripple and its XRP cryptocurrency. Like Ripple, Stellar is a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers.\n\nBoth networks use similar protocols and were derived from the same codebase. In both protocols, there is no mining or algorithmic proof-of-work: All tokens were created at the moment the blockchain was launched.\n\nThe majority of XRP tokens are controlled by Ripple, a for-profit company, while the majority of lumens tokens are held by the nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation. While Ripple is a closed system, Stellar is open-source.\n\n\n\nThey also have different customers. Ripple works with established banking institutions and consortiums in order to streamline their cross-border transfer technology. In contrast, Stellar is focused on developing markets and has multiple use cases for its technology, including money remittances and bank loan distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is XLM Crypto? XLM, or Stellar lumens, is the native cryptocurrency of the stellar blockchain and it is used to pay transaction fees. However, it is not the only cryptocurrency on the Stellar blockchain, which can be used to move tokens representing anything from commodities to fiat currencies.\n\nHow Do I Check the Blockchain for a Stellar Transaction? You can check a stellar transaction on a stellar-focused block explorer. These are online tools that allow users to view recent transactions, blocks, and account balances. Popular Stellar explorers include Stellarchain.io, Blockchair.com, and StellarExpert.\n\nHow Does Stellar Blockchain Work? The Stellar blockchain uses a proof-of-agreement consensus algorithm to ensure coordination between different nodes. These nodes broadcast transactions to one another every five seconds, ensuring that they are all keeping identical versions of the Stellar ledger.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Stellar blockchain is one of the thousands of competitors to Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is used for fast, cheap transactions with minimal computational or energy costs. Although it has occasionally enjoyed sharp price rises, the value of Stellar lumens has plunged with respect to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.
