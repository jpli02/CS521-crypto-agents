        "content": "Exchange-traded fund experts anticipate spot bitcoin ETFs, which debuted this month, to spark a new wave of crypto products.\n\nCboe Global Markets' Catherine Clay believes options are a natural progression for bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\"We believe that the utility of the options, what they provide to the end investor in terms of downside hedging, risk-defined exposures into bitcoin, really would help the end investor and the ecosystem,\" the firm's global head of derivatives told CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" this week.\n\nThe Cboe, the largest U.S. options exchange, filed with the SEC on Jan. 5 to offer options linked to bitcoin exchange-traded products. It expects those options to begin trading later this year, per its news release.\n\nAccording to Dave Nadig, financial futurist at VettaFi, options on the crypto funds could appeal to institutional investors, who have been more reluctant to invest in the digital asset class.\n\n\"You're going to start seeing all sorts of hedge fund players in the space,\" he said in the same interview. \"Folks who might not have been traditionally speculating on crypto directly in the crypto ecosystem are now going to have something to play with.\"\n\nNadig also suggested that zero-day options \u2014 contracts that expire the same day they're traded, commonly known as \"0DTEs\" \u2014 would be the ultimate goal for bitcoin derivatives products.\n\n\"If what happens in bitcoin is what's happened in single stocks, we're going to see retail in particular and a lot of institutions move towards zero days to expiration options trading on bitcoin itself,\" he said.\n\nStill, Cboe's Clay cautioned that those products could be very far away.\n\n\"We still have not even received approval to list options, so let's not get ahead of ourselves and think about 0DTEs,\" she said. \"We want to get options on these ETFs in a very intelligent and thoughtful way that actually \u2026 really builds the ecosystem of new entrants into the market.\"\n\nDisclaimer"

        "content": "Agencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approval of 11 Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) marks a significant milestone in the history of crypto . This event signifies a new era of legitimacy and potential growth for Bitcoin, prompting widespread interest from both retail and institutional investors . Let's take a quick look at the top takeaways from this landmark development and explore its implications for the future of Bitcoin.The SEC's decision to approve 11 Bitcoin ETFs is a historic moment, introducing a new asset class to the global financial markets . This move is expected to lower barriers to entry for investors, simplifying access to Bitcoin investments through traditional investment channels.The ETF approval is poised to significantly impact Bitcoin's market value. Analysts like Tom Lee of Fundstrat and Metlem Demirors of Coinshares predict a significant increase in demand, with price targets ranging from a short-term $100,000 to $150,000 and a long-term potential of $500,000 within the next 3 to 5 years.Currently, Bitcoin stands at the 10th position among the world's largest assets. However, this ranking is expected to rise rapidly. Bitcoin is anticipated to soon surpass major assets such as Meta, Silver, and even tech giant Nvidia, reflecting its growing significance in the global asset hierarchy.There's a notable surge in institutional interest and investment in Bitcoin, particularly in derivative markets. The open interest in Bitcoin Futures on the CME Exchange has achieved a new record, reaching an unprecedented high of 36% in relative dominance. This indicates the substantial involvement of institutional investors in the derivatives market, particularly in purchasing Bitcoin Futures. Additionally, there is a notable surge in Bitcoin short positions, reflecting heightened market activity.Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event in April, where the reward for mining new blocks is halved, is anticipated to further enhance its scarcity, thus potentially driving up its value. This supply shock, combined with a wall of institutional money that is going to come, contributes significantly to Bitcoin's appeal as a long-term investment.Another unique factor is that the percentage of Bitcoin's (BTC) circulating supply that was last active on-chain is about 70% which means that they are HODLing (a term in the crypto community meaning to hold onto the currency long-term). Now, the trend of short-term Bitcoin holders converting to long-term HODLers highlights growing confidence in Bitcoin's future. This shift indicates a belief in the enduring value of Bitcoin, despite its known volatility.Blackrock\u2019s move to cut the fee on its spot ETF to 0.25% makes Bitcoin investments more accessible and cost-effective. This strategic decision is likely to attract a larger group of investors, further embedding Bitcoin in mainstream investment portfolios. Moreover, for the first time, Bitcoin gets serious marketing budgets from these 11 ETFs.The ETF approval has triggered a global ripple effect, with other financial hubs like Hong Kong gearing up to launch additional Bitcoin ETFs. This global adoption speaks volumes about Bitcoin's increasing acceptance and potential for becoming a standard component in investment portfolios worldwide.Financial advisors the world over are beginning to recognise Bitcoin as a viable asset class and will now recommend varying allocations in investment portfolios. This change reflects a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a speculative instrument to a legitimate investment option.Despite facing volatility and regulatory challenges, Bitcoin continues to show robust growth potential. The mainstream acceptance and institutionalisation of Bitcoin ETFs underscore a bullish outlook for the future of this digital asset.The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a regulatory development; it\u2019s a paradigm shift in the world of finance. It signifies the merging of traditional investment methods with the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin continues to make strides into mainstream finance, it\u2019s not only reshaping the investment landscape but also challenging the traditional notions of finance and asset management. With institutional backing, reduced barriers to entry, and a growing acceptance among the general public, Bitcoin is poised to play a pivotal role in the future of global finance. This development marks the beginning of a new chapter, not just for Bitcoin but for the entire crypto ecosystem. As we witness this historic moment, one thing is clear: the world of finance is evolving, and Bitcoin is at the forefront of this revolution.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Right now, crypto investors are laser focused on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). That's fair enough. The recent approval of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs has made Bitcoin even more popular than it already was.\n\nBut if you expand your focus, there are several stocks that stand to benefit from any future gains in Bitcoin. The one that's on my radar right now is MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR). That might sound strange, given that MicroStrategy is an enterprise software company. But if you look under the hood, you'll see why this stock could skyrocket 100% or more this year.\n\nMicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy stock\n\nThe first thing you need to know about MicroStrategy is that it holds a lot of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. And I mean a lot. After a recent buying spree at the end of 2023, MicroStrategy now holds 189,150 Bitcoins. That ranks first among all publicly traded companies, and it's not even close. At Bitcoin's current price of $42,500, those holdings are valued at approximately $8 billion.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIf you compare the company's overall market cap ($6.5 billion) to the value of its Bitcoin, then it becomes immediately obvious just how leveraged MicroStrategy is to the price of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin holdings are worth more than the company itself! In fact, some investors refer to MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy stock because, for the past year, the stock has essentially been just a way to get access to Bitcoin without actually buying Bitcoin. As a result, over the past 12 months, MicroStrategy is up more than 100%.\n\nBitcoin proxy stock or Bitcoin ETF?\n\nBut there's just one problem. The approval of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024 has completely shifted the narrative. The very same investors who once used MicroStrategy as a proxy stock can now invest in Bitcoin ETFs instead. Theoretically, these Bitcoin ETFs will do a much better job of tracking the price of Bitcoin. And, thus, they could eventually make MicroStrategy less appealing to investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs evidence of this, the price of MicroStrategy fell by 20% in just the first 48 hours after Bitcoin ETF approval. For the year, MicroStrategy is down 30%. On top of all that, former MicroStrategy CEO (and current executive chairman) Michael Saylor says that he is planning to sell off 315,000 shares in the company worth over $200 million between now and April. So that should put downward pressure on the price of MicroStrategy as well.\n\nWill Bitcoin go to $100,000?\n\nBut there might be two very good reasons to buy the dip on MicroStrategy. For one, investors appear to be ignoring completely the fact that MicroStrategy is actually an enterprise software company. As noted above, they are ascribing zero value to the company's core business operations (which includes artificial intelligence- and business intelligence-related software solutions), and instead simply valuing MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy. So that's one additional source of value for MicroStrategy.\n\nMoreover, there's the future price of Bitcoin to consider. The Bitcoin ETF is just the first catalyst for Bitcoin this year. The second major catalyst -- the upcoming halving event -- is arriving in April. In three previous halving cycles, the price of Bitcoin has exploded, so investors are expecting the same to happen this year as well. That partially explains why Saylor plans to sell off all those company shares by April: He needs the money to invest in more Bitcoin before it goes completely parabolic.\n\nAdmittedly, this is a very risky strategy, but it's so bold it just might work. According to a growing number of influential voices on Wall Street, the price of Bitcoin could top $100,000 by the end of the year. Thus, by extension, the value of all that Bitcoin on the balance sheet of MicroStrategy should also double. And that means the market cap of MicroStrategy should also double.\n\nBefore you buy MicroStrategy\n\nJust keep in mind that investors have a number of different ways to get access to Bitcoin. They can buy it directly, via a cryptocurrency exchange such as Coinbase Global. They can buy it indirectly via a futures-based Bitcoin ETF. They can buy it indirectly via a spot Bitcoin ETF. And, finally, they can buy it indirectly via an investment in a Bitcoin proxy stock such as MicroStrategy.\n\nYour risk-reward profile will likely determine which strategy makes the most sense for your portfolio. For example, investment giant Vanguard Group has said that it would not be offering the new Bitcoin ETFs to its customers. Instead, (drum roll, please) it will be loading up on MicroStrategy.\n\nFor me, that's a pretty convincing argument that Bitcoin proxy stocks such as MicroStrategy will continue to perform well in 2024. You get indirect access to Bitcoin, plus the additional value from the underlying operations of the company. There is likely to be quite a bit of volatility along the way, so just be sure to buckle up if you plan on adding to your MicroStrategy position this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and MicroStrategy wasn't one of them.

        "content": "You Might Also Like: \u200bCheque fraud victims to get Rs 74 lakh from Axis Bank after 15 years long legal fight\n\nWhat is an exchange-traded fund?\n\n\n\nWhat is a bitcoin ETF?\n\n\n\nDidn\u2019t bitcoin ETFs already exist?\n\n\n\nDo the new products come with any investor protections?\n\n\n\nDoes the SEC\u2019s approval suggest these investment products are safe for ordinary investors?\n\n\n\nThere are 11 new ETFs. How do they differ?\n\n\n\nHow safe is the bitcoin held by these exchange-traded products?\n\n\n\nWhat are the tax implications?\n\n\n\nDo financial planners recommend cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, in this new format?\n\n\n\nWhat do retirement account regulators say about the new products?\n\n\n\nAre bitcoin ETFs available everywhere, given their risks?\n\n\n\nNow that the SEC has approved this, can we expect more crypto-based exchange-traded products?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly a dozen new investments funds that hold bitcoin began trading last week, making it easier for anyone with a basic brokerage account to buy a slice of the digital currency.Several established financial institutions, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have coalesced around bitcoin because it is the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency.But bitcoin remains an enigma to most everyday investors, and it\u2019s hard to separate the buzz from any true potential. It\u2019s also wildly volatile.In other words, it\u2019s a bet. And institutions are wagering that plenty of investors want in.But putting crypto into a traditional investment wrapper does not paper over the underlying risks. Here\u2019s a look at how it works:Exchange-traded funds are similar to mutual funds, but they can be traded on an exchange like a stock. ETFs track the performance of the assets they hold, which might include a diversified basket of securities like stock or bonds, or even single commodities, like gold, silver and crypto.They were initially designed to track indexes (like the S&P 500) or spheres of the market and were heralded for their low costs and tax efficiency. But they\u2019ve grown in popularity in recent years. Many ETFs now track narrower and more esoteric slices of the markets, while others use leverage to magnify bets on a specific stock or sector or the market overall.The bitcoin exchange-traded products that recently started trading are designed to track bitcoin\u2019s price, minus the fees and cost of trading. This throws open the gates to any investors with a traditional brokerage account who can now buy the shares as if they were buying stock in Apple or Google.These investments are similar to gold exchange-traded products, which provide an easier way to get exposure to gold without holding the gold bars themselves.There are several other ways to gain direct exposure to bitcoin, including through crypto exchanges as well as specialized digital wallets. But with bitcoin ETFs , you\u2019re delegating the complicated part to large financial institutions, meaning you don\u2019t have to worry about \u201chot wallets,\u201d \u201ccold storage\u201d and lost passwords that can forever lock you out from access to your bitcoin.Yes, but they\u2019re different: ETFs that invest in bitcoin futures contracts \u2014 or agreements to buy or sell an asset at a certain price sometime later \u2014 have been around since 2021. The reason the new products are called \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin ETFs is that they\u2019re holding bitcoin itself, not a derivative that provides secondary exposure. So-called spot markets trade something, often some type of commodity, on the spot, or instantly.The futures-based bitcoin ETFs can end up being more expensive because the contracts expire and must be sold and repurchased, or \u201crolled,\u201d each month. Those costs can be potentially significant, particularly when the new contracts cost more than the previous month\u2019s, causing managers to buy high and sell low.VanEck recently said it would shutter its bitcoin futures ETF now that it offered a spot version.The new bitcoin products are not your standard-issue exchange-traded funds, which, like mutual funds, are typically registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and come with more regulatory protections than these investments.Instead, these \u201cexchange-traded products\u201d are subject to looser controls around their fees and conflicts of interest. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn\u2019t have the same authority to conduct examinations of these products as with typical ETFs.If you\u2019re considering making a small bet, take the time to read the product\u2019s prospectus, which is a typically dense and lengthy document that explains an investment\u2019s objective, high risks, costs and other pertinent information.The prospectus for the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund is 112 pages, but you need to read only six paragraphs before you\u2019re hit over the head with the following, in all caps: THE SHARES ARE SPECULATIVE SECURITIES. THEIR PURCHASE INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND YOU COULD LOSE YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Disclosures from other providers use the same language.Nope. Just because everyday investors have been granted easy access in a well-known investment wrapper does not change anything about the underlying holdings.Crypto supporters had been pushing for a bitcoin ETF for more than a decade, but the SEC rebuffed them, arguing that the market was awash with fraud and subject to manipulation. (More than 20 related products were denied approval in recent years.) But this time, a federal appeals court decision seemingly forced the SEC\u2019s hand: The court ruled that the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale Investments\u2019 application didn\u2019t adequately explain its denial, since it had already approved similar products using bitcoin futures.The matter was sent back to the SEC, which voted 3-2 to approve the products. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who voted in favor, said the agency\u2019s product approvals were not an endorsement of bitcoin, and he called it \u201cprimarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion and terrorist financing.\u201dCaroline Crenshaw, a Democratic commissioner who voted to deny approval, ran through a list of investor safety concerns in her dissent, from inadequate oversight of the markets to wash trading, where traders artificially increase trading volume by buying and selling products simultaneously, to drum up interest and drive prices higher.They\u2019re pretty similar in both structure and price.But a couple of familiar names \u2014 BlackRock and Fidelity \u2014 set themselves apart from the pack early on with higher trading volumes, which can translate into lower costs for investors. They were followed by Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and Bitwise, a boutique firm that specializes in cryptocurrency. All four products had already amassed roughly $2.5 billion in total assets as of Thursday.But they were eclipsed by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC, which had a head start: It has been around for more than a decade and converted its established bitcoin trust into an ETF, which has about $26 billion in assets.Having nearly a dozen products drop onto the market at once was a huge win for investors: Providers immediately began undercutting one another on price; most fees range from 0.19% of assets annually to 0.39%, according to Morningstar, with many firms waiving fees for an introductory period. Since many online brokerage firms have eliminated most trading commissions, the cost of entry is minimal.There is an outlier: Grayscale has a fee of 1.5%. But more than $1.5 billion had recently flowed out of the fund, probably because some investors are turning to cheaper alternatives.They will be held by a third party. Most of the new ETFs have hired Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, to be their custodian, which means it will be responsible for the security of all the private keys to bitcoin held by these ETFs, explained Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar. It is also likely to be the exchange where much of the trading occurs when the shares of these products are created and cashed out. \u201cMuch relies on Coinbase\u2019s safe passage,\u201d Armour noted.The VanEck Bitcoin Trust hired Gemini, another exchange with an institutional operation. (VanEck\u2019s trading symbol is HODL, an abbreviation for \u201cHold on for dear life,\u201d which refers to holding on to bitcoin despite its stomach-churning volatility.)Fidelity is an exception: Its fund will hold its products\u2019 bitcoin on its own platform, Fidelity Digital Asset Services.For tax purposes, the IRS views bitcoin and other digital currencies as property, not currency, which means it is treated similarly to an investment in stocks.\u201cThe tax treatment of a bitcoin ETF will be similar to holding Bitcoin directly,\u201d said Selva Ozelli, a certified public accountant and the author of \u201cSustainably Investing in Digital Assets Globally.\u201dIf you\u2019ve held the shares for more than a year in a taxable account, any gains would be taxed at the less onerous capital gains rates (generally 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your taxable income and tax bracket that year). Short-term gains, which apply to investments held for a year or less, are taxed as ordinary income.A vast majority do not.\u201cAt best, it\u2019s deemed too volatile,\u201d said Michael Kitces, an influential thinker in the financial advisory industry, who added that advisers were at risk of being sued when markets crashed more than 35%, so there wasn\u2019t much appetite for something that periodically crashed 80% or more. \u201cAt worst, the advisers are skeptics about crypto and its viability altogether.\u201dIn a 2023 survey conducted by the Journal of Financial Planning and the Financial Planning Association, cryptocurrency was dead last on a list of what advisers were using in their clients\u2019 portfolios. The survey found that just 2.3% of advisers allocated crypto, up from 0.3% in 2019, but 3.1% said they planned to recommend it more in the next year. Will that meaningfully change with the availability of user-friendly, low-cost bitcoin ETFs?Kitces said he would expect a segment of advisers to allocate 1% or 2% of a client\u2019s portfolio to bitcoin ETFs, particularly if the individual expressed interest. But others are likely to argue that such a small allocation won\u2019t make a material difference over the long term, so they would rather not introduce the risk. There\u2019s a long list of alternative investments that can help diversify a portfolio \u2014 with less volatility \u2014 before you resort to crypto, he said.They have serious concerns about Americans using their retirement money to invest in crypto, echoing a stance regulators issued a couple of years ago.Few workplace retirement plans offer crypto, but after hearing that more plans were receiving pitches from firms to add digital assets to their investment menus, the Labor Department issued guidance in March 2022, reminding plan administrators of their responsibilities. The department oversees workplace retirement plans, which held $8 trillion on behalf of 96 million 401(k) participants.Retirement plan administrators \u2014 who must act solely in the best interest of the employees participating \u2014 are responsible for choosing prudent investment options. If they include what could be deemed an imprudent option and leave it to the worker to decide its merits, that would amount to a failure of fiduciary duty, the department said in its guidance.\u201cBefore they expose plan participants to the risks associated with cryptocurrency, they should study our guidance carefully and make certain that they can square their actions with their duties of care and loyalty to the plan participants they are charged to protect,\u201d said Lisa Gomez, assistant secretary for employee benefits security at the Labor Department.Not all mainstream institutions are embracing the new crypto ETFs, and firms that make them available will have guardrails.Vanguard has no plans to introduce its own bitcoin ETF, and other firms\u2019 shiny new bitcoin products won\u2019t be available for purchase on its brokerage platform, either.\u201cThese products are not aligned with our long-standing focus on offering core building blocks for long-term investment portfolios to help clients meet goals such as retirement or saving for college,\u201d Vanguard said in a statement. \u201cUnlike equities and bonds, they generally lack intrinsic economic value and do not generate cash flows like dividends and interest payments.\u201dMerrill, part of Bank of America, is making them available only to people with $10 million in investable assets.Others are offering the products, but with some restrictions: Schwab and E-Trade, for example, said the bitcoin ETFs could not be sold short or sold on margin, which involves borrowing money from the brokerage to trade (and can increase gains but amplify losses).Yes. There are already seven applications \u2014 from many of the same players \u2014 to track the spot price of ether, another digital currency, according to Deborah Fuhr, founder and managing partner of ETFGI, a research and consulting firm. And ProShares is seeking approval for a handful of ETFs that make bets on the direction of bitcoin\u2019s price.Industry experts expect these products to be ushered through by regulators, too.\u201cThat\u2019s likely all we get for a while,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, an ETF data and analytics firm. \u201cThe government remains uncertain about cryptocurrency in general.\u201dI\u2019m still thinking about wading in.Before you do, perform a small thought experiment: What would happen if I woke up one morning, and my investment had dropped 40%? How would I react? What would it mean for my finances overall?Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, said his firm\u2019s research had found that once investors allocated more than 5% of their portfolio to cryptocurrency, it became the biggest driver of a portfolio\u2019s steepest losses.\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that gives you a pit in your stomach,\u201d he said."
