        "content": "A popular crypto analyst is unveiling his forecast for Bitcoin (BTC) after the king crypto plunged over 6% on March 3rd.\n\nAnalyst Justin Bennett says in a recent newsletter that Bitcoin bulls should pay close attention to the $23,130 price for BTC.\n\nAccording to the trader, BTC could witness another sell-off event if bulls fail to recapture the key price area.\n\n\u201cThe key for bulls is a reclaim above the $23,130 monthly open. The longer Bitcoin trades below that area, the stronger it becomes as resistance.\n\nIf Bitcoin bulls fail to reclaim $23,130, we could move toward the $20,800 liquidity pool.\n\nIf they can reclaim $23,130, then $23,800 is the next hurdle for buyers.\n\nBut, for now, Bitcoin is range bound between the January trend line at $21,900 and the monthly open at $23,130.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $22,491, way below the analyst\u2019s crucial price level.\n\nLooking at Ethereum (ETH), Bennett believes that the leading smart contract platform is following in the footsteps of BTC. According to the analyst, ETH could be gearing up for the next leg down as long as it is trading below $1,600.\n\n\u201cAs of now, the $1,600 area is new resistance based on recent closing prices and lows this week.\n\nThe monthly open is just above that at $1,605, so keep that in mind.\n\nIf ETH bulls can\u2019t reclaim $1,605 in the next few days, we\u2019ll likely see a retest of $1,500 support, and below that is the $1,420 confluence of support.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,575.\n\nAs for blockchain scaling solution Polygon (MATIC), Bennett says the altcoin looks bearish and appears to be at risk for a move below $1.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s a bit concerning is how MATIC has (so far) been unable to climb back above $1.179 today.\n\nThat\u2019s been a key pivot since late January, so a daily close below it could be significant.\n\nIf MATIC closes below $1.1790, the next stop is $1.056 unless it becomes a fakeout, of course.\n\nBut all in all, MATIC looks increasingly weak, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see $1.056 tested in the coming days, if not the $1 mark or lower.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, MATIC is worth $1.15.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Monetary policy of cryptocurrencies, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is monetary policy in crypto? Monetary policy in crypto refers to the mechanisms used to manage the supply and circulation of cryptocurrencies. These mechanisms are intended to ensure the sustainability, stability and predictability of a coin\u2019s value over time. Cryptocurrencies rely on decentralized protocols to handle their monetary policy, as opposed to conventional fiat currencies, which are controlled by central banks and governments. These protocols may contain a number of tools for regulating the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply, including block rewards, changes to the mining difficulty and issuance rates. For instance, Bitcoin (BTC) has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. As time goes on, the pace at which new coins are introduced to the supply continuously declines, eventually causing a deflationary situation as the rate of new supply gets closer to zero. On the contrary, certain cryptocurrencies may employ alternative mechanisms to govern their monetary policy, like proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus systems, which use staking to encourage network activity and control the cryptocurrency supply.\n\nHow do cryptocurrencies have monetary value? Cryptocurrencies have monetary value because people assign value to them, much like any other currency or asset. A cryptocurrency\u2019s value is primarily influenced by market forces of supply and demand. A cryptocurrency will become more expensive if there are more buyers than there are sellers prepared to accept their offers. The price will fall, however, if there are more sellers of a cryptocurrency than there are buyers ready to purchase it. Related: What is tokenomics? A beginner\u2019s guide on supply and demand of cryptocurrencies Other factors that can influence the value of a cryptocurrency include its utility, security and adoption. For instance, a cryptocurrency that is widely recognized as a form of payment and has a clear use case will probably be worth more than one that is not extensively accepted. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies with robust security features and a track record of dependability will often be more valuable than those with lax security or a history of hacks and flaws.\n\nHow will cryptocurrencies affect monetary policy? Although the precise impact will depend on how widely cryptocurrencies are used and integrated into the current financial system, cryptocurrencies have the potential to influence monetary policy in a number of ways. Here are some possible ways in which cryptocurrencies could affect monetary policy: Reduced control over the money supply: Due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the lack of a central controlling entity, standard monetary policy tools like printing money or changing interest rates may not have the same effect on them as they do on fiat currencies. This might restrict central banks\u2019 power to affect the total amount of fiat money in circulation.\n\nNew sources of data: Large amounts of transactional data generated by cryptocurrencies could be used to get important insights into consumer behavior and broader economic patterns. It may be necessary for central banks to figure out how to include this data in the decision-making process.\n\nIncreased competition: Since cryptocurrencies provide an alternate method of payment and a store of value, they may become more competitive than traditional fiat currencies. This can put pressure on central banks to keep their currencies stable and valuable to remain competitive. Additionally, banks are experimenting with CBDC projects in response to the potential threat of cryptocurrencies, which could disrupt traditional banking and payment systems.\n\nEnhanced financial inclusion: Cryptocurrencies have the potential to give people and enterprises who might not have access to traditional banking services better financial access and inclusion. As a result, monetary policy may shift as central banks may need to consider how a more diversified and decentralized financial system will behave. Related: What is a CBDC? Why central banks want to get into digital currencies\n\nWho controls Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy? BTC\u2019s monetary policy is controlled by the rules built into the Bitcoin software protocol, which is open-source and operates in a decentralized manner. The protocol\u2019s rules dictate how new BTC is created and distributed over time. Moreover, any proposed changes to the protocol must be approved by a majority of the network\u2019s users, making Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy subject to the consensus of its users. Particularly, the protocol\u2019s built-in issuance schedule serves as the foundation for Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy. The total number of BTC that will ever be created is 21 million. New Bitcoin is produced through a process called mining, where users compete to solve challenging mathematical problems in exchange for rewards that include newly created BTC. The mining reward is automatically reduced by half every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), a process known as halving. This indicates that as time passes, the rate of new BTC generation declines, eventually resulting in a maximum supply of 21 million. One of the main components of Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy is its constant supply, which works to maintain scarcity and prevent inflation.\n\nDo stablecoins alter the monetary policy transmission mechanism? Stablecoins may function outside of conventional banking and payment systems and may offer an alternative form of payment and store of value, which has the potential to change how monetary policy is transmitted. A classic monetary policy transmission mechanism involves the employment of various tools, such as changing interest rates by central banks to affect the money supply, the actions of financial institutions and the behavior of people. Stablecoins, however, might operate separately from these conventional dynamics and might not be directly impacted by adjustments to interest rates or other monetary policy instruments. For instance, stablecoins may be considered a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of market turbulence or economic unpredictability. Stablecoins may see a surge in popularity during these times, which may lessen the impact of conventional monetary policy tools like interest rate increases. Moreover, stablecoins might alter the demand for conventional fiat currencies and affect the effectiveness of monetary policy if they were to gain widespread adoption. Nonetheless, in order to account for stablecoins\u2019 effects on the whole economy and incorporate them into their policy frameworks, central banks may need to develop new strategies."

        "title": "What Ordinal NFTs Mean for Bitcoin \u2013 BRINK \u2013 Conversations and Insights on Global Business - BRINK",
        "content": "Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images\n\nThe Bitcoin community is in turmoil. Ordinal NFTs \u2014 also referred to as \u201cDigital Artifacts\u201d and \u201cOrdinal inscriptions\u201d \u2014 surfaced on January 21, 2023, on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin maximalists are furious \u2014 they believe NFTs are spamming and attacking the Bitcoin network. Other Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that Ordinal NFTs make the Bitcoin network not only more fun but also can help generate more revenues for Bitcoin miners.\n\nBitcoin is now home to 100,000+ Ordinal NFTs, including a playable DOOM game clone, and JPEGS of \u201cTaproot Wizards,\u201d \u201cAstral Babes,\u201d and \u201cOrdinal Punks.\u201d\n\nHeated debate has primarily focused on whether Ordinal NFTs are a positive or negative development for the Bitcoin network. The answer depends on whether one believes Bitcoin should be purely a monetary system or serve multiple use cases.\n\nWhether one loves or hates them, the fact is that Ordinal NFTs exist and will continue to be minted on the Bitcoin network \u2014 in the absence of a soft or hard fork.\n\nGiven that Ordinal NFTs have arrived, what do they mean for Bitcoin? Here are my thoughts on three implications:\n\nBlockchain upgrades can bring significant, unintended consequences. Ordinal NFTs could pose a threat to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. Bitcoin is decentralized in technology and decision-making \u2014 especially because Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared.\n\nA Brief History of Bitcoin NFTs\n\nImmortalizing non-monetary data (e.g., JPEGs, video files, etc.) on the Bitcoin network is not new. In fact, the Genesis block \u2014 the very first Bitcoin block ever created by pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto included a message: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\n\nBuying/selling immortalized data is also not new to Bitcoin. Counterparty NFTs are an example of Bitcoin-based NFTs that have existed since 2014.\n\nBut three technical features distinguish Ordinal NFTs from previously existing Bitcoin NFTs: 1) content size limit 2) content storage and security 3) cost to mint (i.e., create an NFT).\n\nTwo soft-fork upgrades enabled these net new technical features on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe SegWit upgrade in 2017 increased the total data that a block could carry to 4MB and created a cheaper category of data The Taproot upgrade in 2021 which enabled the mechanism by which content attached to Ordinal NFTs gets published to the Bitcoin network.\n\nImplication 1: Blockchain upgrades can bring significant, unintended consequences\n\nWithout both Segwit and Taproot upgrades, it would not be possible to upload 4MB of content completely and relatively cheaply onto the Bitcoin network.\n\nYet, the motivations behind the Segwit and Taproot upgrades were far from seeking to enable anything akin to Ordinal NFTs.\n\nSome have dismissed Ordinal NFTs as \u201cnothing new, Bitcoin goes on\u201d since uploading non-monetary content to the Bitcoin network has always been possible \u2014 since the Genesis block.\n\nThese critics are missing the point. Bitcoin NFTs prior to Ordinal NFTs did not achieve mass popularity, at least partly because they were too expensive to mint, and only up to 80 bytes of content could be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain itself. This meant that NFT enthusiasts were incentivized to turn to other blockchains, such as Ethereum, where they faced less restrictive content size (compared to 80 bytes) and fee limitations when minting NFTs. This incentive no longer exists with Ordinal NFTs due to the three new technical features outlined above in Figure 1. Today, more content can be immortalized and secured per NFT on Bitcoin than on other blockchains, including Ethereum, for significantly reduced fees.\n\nImplication 2: Ordinal NFTs could pose a threat to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and as a store of value\n\nBitcoin maximalists are furious about Ordinal NFTs because they believe that the sole purpose of Bitcoin should be to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as articulated in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s whitepaper. Ordinal NFTs attack this vision as they take up block space that would otherwise be used for financial transactions, increase the bandwidth required to operate a full Bitcoin node, and drive up transaction fees for financial transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nOrdinal NFT proponents argue that the Bitcoin network can be used by anyone for anything, including funny JPEGs, so long as they can pay the associated transaction fees. After all, the Bitcoin protocol itself permits uploading non-financial content for a price.\n\nIf Ordinal NFTs gain and maintain popularity, they will compete with financial transactions for space on the Bitcoin network. Given the increased demand for block space, the transaction fees needed to transact on Bitcoin will increase. Transaction fees have generally increased since Ordinal NFTs were launched on January 21. Increased transaction fees harm some but benefit others. Those who rely on Bitcoin\u2019s historically low transaction fees \u2014 for example, those who send Bitcoin to send remittances \u2014 will be negatively impacted. Benefit will accrue to other stakeholders, including Bitcoin miners, whose revenues rely partly on transaction fees.\n\nAll else equal, increased transaction fees can threaten Bitcoin\u2019s viability as an everyday medium of monetary exchange in the shorter term. Some would argue that layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, already solve this potential threat to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Yet, layer 2 solutions offer less decentralization and security than the Bitcoin network.\n\nIn the longer term, Bitcoin as a store of monetary value may be at risk. Practically anyone can upload anything up to 4MB to the Bitcoin network for a price that many are willing to pay \u2014 this could run the whole gamut of funny videos, child pornography, confidential documents, how-to guides banned by governments, etc. In particular, if Bitcoin is associated with immortalizing illegal content in significant volumes, Bitcoin\u2019s perceived legitimacy as a legal monetary system will be put to the test.\n\nImplication 3: Bitcoin is decentralized in technology and decision-making \u2014 especially because Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared\n\nExtreme emotions abound in the \u201cOrdinal NFTs, good or bad for Bitcoin?\u201d debate.\n\nYet, no one can unilaterally take any action.\n\nThe current conflict between Bitcoin maximalists and Ordinal NFT proponents \u2014 where arguments are vehement and actions are curtailed \u2014 reflects Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, not only in technology but also in decision-making.\n\nThe decentralized nature of decision-making in the Bitcoin community is likely only possible due to the disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe debate about the legitimate use cases of the Bitcoin network has existed since the beginning. In 2009, Nakamoto explicitly indicated their belief that Bitcoin should be used for financial transactions and that financial and non-financial use cases should not mix on a blockchain network (see Figure 2).\n\nA counterfactual scenario to consider: If Nakamoto were still present today, their voice and reason would likely hold significant sway over the Bitcoin community, similar to how Vitalik Buterin\u2019s voice and reason hold weight in the Ethereum community.\n\nBitcoin As Money Is At Stake\n\nRelated Reading Is the Metaverse Dying Already? NFTs: 4 Insights to Capitalize on a Multibillion-Dollar Market How Will Web3 Impact the Future of Work? Purchasing the Metaverse \u2014 How Does It Work?\n\nBitcoin upgrades are highly technical. Translating these highly technical changes precisely and comprehensively into non-technical terms is often challenging. It is incumbent on technical and non-technical Bitcoin stakeholders to work together to think through not only the intended implications for blockchain operations but also the potentially inadvertent implications that often result from a complex web of incentive structures. Thinking through potential unintended consequences is particularly important in a decentralized system, where achieving majority consensus to do \u2014 and undo \u2014 actions is incredibly difficult.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ordinal NFTs will seriously compete with financial transactions on the Bitcoin network. One thing is clear \u2014 resources to develop the Bitcoin network are limited. When competing priorities exist, no single priority can get full attention.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Metaverse Musings on Substack"
