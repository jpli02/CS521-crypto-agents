This positive price movement might be because of a paper that came out yesterday from the IMF and the G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board.

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum (ETH) have been caught in a whirlwind of changes, and there's a new contender that's making waves: Everlodge. Let's delve into the recent movements of these cryptocurrencies, and explore how they are shaping the future of digital finance.\n\nJoin the Everlodge\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Soars After Grayscale Wins the SEC Case\n\nRecently, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has become popular because Grayscale won a case against the SEC. The cryptocurrency market went up after this news, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was one of the coins that experienced maximum surge. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is now trading at around $220, which is the highest price it has been in a week.\n\nBut, these kinds of big changes are not always permanent. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is still 95.65% lower than its all-time high price. In the past week, the price has gone up by 12.96%, but in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has only gone up by 1.63%.\n\nHowever, the future of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is uncertain. While some analysts believe that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could go up in price, others have a bearish outlook about it.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Releases New Guide to Replace Outdated Yellow Paper\n\nEthereum (ETH) has created a new guide, called Ethereum EELS. It is replacing the old Yellow Paper, which is not up-to-date. The EELS is easy to use, and has all the latest information about Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe EELS provides a complete guide to how Ethereum (ETH) works at every stage. This is important because previous Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) only suggested changes, without explaining how they would fit into the existing Ethereum (ETH) framework.\n\nAs of now, Ethereum's (ETH) price is $1,646.42. While Ethereum (ETH) has grown by 2.98% in the past week, it has declined by 1.13% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is still 66.34% below its all-time high of $4,891.70.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG)\n\nThe average vacation rental owner earns $24,000 per year. But what if you could start earning passive income from vacation rentals without having to own, or manage a property? With Everlodge, you can do just that.\n\nEverlodge is a new platform that makes it easy to invest in vacation rentals. It is like Airbnb, but instead of renting out your own home, you can buy a share of a vacation rental for just $100, using Web3. The platform has already sold over 27 million tokens, and is valued at $0.012.\n\nELDG uses blockchain technology to make the process secure, and transparent. Each vacation rental is represented by a non-fungible token (NFT). NFTs are special digital items that you can buy and sell. When you buy an NFT, you are buying a share of the vacation rental.\n\nAdditionally, the marketplace will let you buy, sell, and invest in small parts of real estate properties, like villas, homes, and hotels. You can browse listings, purchase your vacation home, and start generating income, all in one place.\n\nThe platform will also have a launchpad where developers can raise money from the ELDG community. The Rewards Club will give members free stays at Everlodge properties. This is a great way to enjoy vacation rentals without having to pay full price. Members can also resell their free stays for extra income.\n\nFinally, co-owners of the properties can use their property-backed NFTs as collateral for loans. Thus, they can borrow money against the value of their property.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG)\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.

        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: ETF developments bolsters Bitcoin above US$26,000 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose 1.1% from Sept. 1 to Sept. 8 to US$26,267 as of 3:30 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading below US$30,000 since Aug. 9, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAfter falling to a weekly low of US$25,413 last Friday, Bitcoin briefly rose above US$26,000 on Sunday and Monday before regaining the support level on Friday.\n\n\u201cDespite Grayscale\u2019s recent court win, investor confidence in Bitcoin remains subdued. The court victory failed to boost the Bitcoin price,\u201d Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe lackluster response indicates generally bearish sentiment in the crypto sector. Investors are increasingly diversifying their portfolios with assets other than Bitcoin, such as stocks or real estate. While the crypto markets have been relatively quiet in recent months, the stock market offers them more volatility and therefore opportunity.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, asset manager Grayscale\u2019s lawyers sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting a meeting with the agency about the path to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Grayscale\u2019s lawyers said that there are no grounds for the SEC to continue to block the conversion.\n\nThis pivotal ruling is not only a beacon of optimism for Grayscale but may also pave the way for other financial heavyweights, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, waiting for the SEC\u2019s decision on their own spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Image: Grayscale/SEC\n\nOn Wednesday, asset manager Ark Invest filed for a spot Ether ETF in the U.S., naming Coinbase as a custodian. If accepted, this would be the first publicly traded Ether ETF in the U.S. Despite the positive development, Ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, inched up 0.16% over the week to US$1,647.\n\nOn the same day, Bitcoin received institutional fair value accounting approval from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The long-awaited rules will kick in in 2025, allowing companies with large Bitcoin holdings to report their assets at fair value, capturing the most up-to-date value of the asset and making it easier for companies to hold Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action may also be affected by the September effect, which refers to the phenomenon where traditional equity performance is historically weaker during the month, according to Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto.\n\n\u201cWhile there is some statistical evidence from the last century supporting its existence, many economists and market professionals dismiss it as a reliable predictor. If one accepts the September effect as true for equity markets and given that correlations between Bitcoin and traditional markets are currently positive, it\u2019s conceivable that a weak September in the stock market could also influence Bitcoin prices negatively,\u201d Betz told Forkast.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.05 trillion on Friday at 3:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, maintaining the same value from a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$511 billion, Bitcoin represented 48.5% of the market while Ether, valued at US$198 billion, accounted for 18.8%.\n\nNotable movers: SNX, IOTA\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of decentralized finance protocol Synthetix (SNX) was this week\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 100, rallying 17.07% to US$2.26. The coin started gaining on Monday, shortly after the protocol announced details about the upcoming perpetual futures V3 testnet, including a trading competition on the new testnet with a US$5,000 reward for first place.\n\nThe utility token of the IOTA protocol (MIOTA), a blockchain designed for value and data transfers on the Internet of Things, was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 14.57% to US$0.1791. The token started picking up momentum on Wednesday after the protocol announced that the victims of the 2018 online seed generation scam will have their losses refunded.\n\nNext week: Could Bitcoin fall to US$20,300?\n\n\u201cTechnical analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s price charts reveals concerning patterns. The formation of lower highs, price reversals to the downside, and failure to breach key resistance levels indicate a potential continuation of the ongoing downward trend,\u201d wrote Yield App\u2019s Kiely.\n\n\u201cWhile trend lines suggest Bitcoin could fall below US$20,000, it could also revisit US$23,000 in a Fibonacci retrace.\u201d\n\nArk Invest\u2019s The Bitcoin Monthly report also noted that Bitcoin has a downside risk of US$20,300, which is the market\u2019s average cost basis.\n\nNext week, investors will be looking forward to the release of the U.S. core consumer price index, which measures the inflation of goods and services, excluding foods and energy.\n\nOver in Europe, the European Central Bank\u2019s next interest rate decision is scheduled for next Thursday.\n\nSee related article: N.
