        "title": "Why Did Citadel-Backed EDX List Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin Cash, a spin-off from the oldest digital asset, has struggled to find a market since launching in 2017. But it\u2019s been on a roll this month: since the start of June, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 98%, jumping from $113 to $224.\n\nThe slightly obscure digital asset\u2014one of many cryptocurrency \u201cforks\u201d\u2014is following Bitcoin, like many other coins and tokens which have surged in price since the biggest digital asset experienced a run. But BCH is doing by far the best.\n\nWhy? The coin is one of the lucky four chosen for EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nEDX, which launched last week, decided to let its traders\u2014institutional investors only\u2014start off with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe reason is simple: regulatory clarity.\n\n\u201cThese specific cryptocurrencies are generally perceived as commodities by regulatory bodies, which significantly mitigates potential legal challenges,\u201d Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\nYouwei Yang, Chief Economist at BTCM, added that the four assets are \u201cwidely regarded as digital commodities, making them relatively safe\u201d from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because they are made with electricity\u2014a commodity.\n\nIn perhaps its toughest regulatory crackdown yet, the SEC has gone after a number of major crypto brands for allegedly flogging unregistered securities. Earlier this month, it went after Coinbase for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service. It also targeted Binance, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, with a massive lawsuit for allegedly \u201coperating as a fking [sic] unlicensed securities exchange in the U.S.A. bro,\u201d according to the SEC.\n\nIn February, it hit Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nEvery Crypto Project Must Reckon With the SEC's Howey Test\n\nStory continues\n\nThese regulatory enforcements are all because SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks\u2014and has said for years\u2014that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.\n\nBut he has made it clear that Bitcoin is a commodity. He has been less clear on Ethereum, but the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) has said the asset is a commodity.\n\nAnd Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are both Bitcoin forks\u2014new cryptocurrencies that emerged from the asset\u2019s original code\u2014meaning they are likely to have the same status in the eyes of regulators.\n\nGreg Moritz, Co-Founder at the crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said that \u201cnone have been listed by the SEC as unregistered securities,\u201d adding that all four assets are established and have history, \u201ckey factors in the decision-making process of EDX\u2019s backers.\u201d\n\nEDX Markets CEO Jamil Nazarali also said that he felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d that the four assets weren\u2019t securities.\n\nFor now, these four \u201cold school\u201d cryptocurrencies will give \u201cold school\u201d investors a taste of the crypto world. But things could change, Feng noted. \u201cAs regulations evolve and the understanding of different cryptocurrencies becomes more nuanced, we could anticipate exchanges like EDX broadening their offerings,\u201d he added."
