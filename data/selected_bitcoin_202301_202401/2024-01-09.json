        "content": "For 15 minutes, the cryptocurrency industry was euphoric.\n\nAt 4:11 p.m. on Tuesday, the official X account of the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that regulators had approved a new investment product tracking the price of Bitcoin, an apparent victory for embattled crypto supporters. Coinbase, a giant crypto exchange, posted a celebratory banner. Crypto executives hailed it as a historic day for the industry. Bitcoin\u2019s price spiked.\n\nThen at 4:26 p.m., Gary Gensler, the chair of the S.E.C., posted that the agency\u2019s account had been compromised, resulting in an \u201cunauthorized tweet.\u201d An S.E.C. spokeswoman confirmed the hack in an emailed statement.\n\nThe security breach was the latest twist in the crypto industry\u2019s yearslong pursuit of an investment vehicle known as an exchange traded fund tied to the price of Bitcoin. Since the fall, crypto enthusiasts have counted down the days until a Jan. 10 deadline for the S.E.C. to decide whether to allow a Bitcoin E.T.F. Bitcoin\u2019s price has surged more than 60 percent in recent months, driven by the rising optimism that an approval was imminent.\n\nAn announcement was widely expected this week, with major financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity poised to roll out the Bitcoin products. On social media, speculation has raged about the exact timing of an approval, inspiring memes about once-obscure S.E.C. procedures and propelling E.T.F. analysts to online stardom."

        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nBitcoin initially jumped as high as $47,901, its highest level since March 2022, according to Coin Metrics, before dropping to as low as $44,816.94. It was last trading lower by more than 1% at $46,162.79.\n\nThe SEC later deleted the post and said its account on X was compromised and it had not approved the ETFs.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell during late afternoon trading Tuesday following a false social media post from the X account of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that stated the agency had approved bitcoin exchange-traded funds for trading.\n\n\"The sell-off is showing a rattled market,\" said Michael Rinko, research analyst at Delphi Digital. \"This kind of high-volume boomerang event probably spooked some people and led to people taking some risk off the table, but the initial market reaction is encouraging.\"\n\nInvestors had expected an update from the SEC as soon as tomorrow, with some hoping the decision would come earlier. Wednesday marks the deadline for the SEC to either approve or deny the Ark 21Shares spot bitcoin ETF application. It is widely believed that the agency will approve several at once.\n\nBitcoin had traded below the $47,000 level for much of Tuesday, after crossing it one day prior for the first time since April 2022, as updated SEC filings from potential bitcoin ETF issuers bolstered investors' confidence that an approval is inevitable.\n\nSome investors say the day one effect of an approval has been overestimated and that it could be a sell-the-news event. Bitcoin has advanced about 60% in the past three months, primarily as a result of the ETF hype. Additionally, investors have been sitting on high unrealized profits \u2014 a trend that historically precedes price corrections \u2014 according to data from CryptoQuant.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"
