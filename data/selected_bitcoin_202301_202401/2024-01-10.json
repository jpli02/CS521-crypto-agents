But the wild market reaction may serve as a preview of the S.E.C.\u2019s actual decision on those Bitcoin products, which is expected today.\n\nFor 15 minutes, the crypto community was euphoric. At 4:11 p.m. Eastern, the @SECGov account on the platform X said that the S.E.C. had approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, investment products tied directly to the price of the digital currency.\n\nThe crypto community has been eagerly awaiting that announcement, because such products \u2014 including those proposed by investment giants like BlackRock and Fidelity \u2014 could help make buying into Bitcoin easier for mainstream audiences. (The exchange Coinbase, for instance, posted a celebratory banner.) Investors plowed money into Bitcoin, with its price rising 2.5 percent to a weeklong high of $47,893 on the post."

Some of the largest financial firms in the world, including the asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity, were approved to offer the products, known as E.T.F.s, which could begin trading as soon as Thursday on traditional platforms like the Nasdaq.\n\nThe approvals were hailed as a sign that mainstream financial institutions remain willing to deal in digital currencies even after 18 months of market crashes and high-profile bankruptcies. Since the fall, Bitcoin\u2019s price has surged more than 60 percent, as traders bet that approval of the new crypto products would give the industry an imprimatur of regulatory legitimacy, drawing fresh investment from professional wealth managers and amateur traders.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin shot up on Tuesday after a post appeared on the S.E.C.\u2019s official X account announcing the approval of the E.T.F.s, but dropped swiftly when Gary Gensler, the S.E.C. chair, said the agency\u2019s account had been hacked."

        "title": "11 newly approved bitcoin ETFs start trading today\u2014but experts say to 'approach with caution' - CNBC",
        "content": "As of Thursday morning, the Securities Exchange Commission has approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The move is widely expected to bring more legitimacy to an industry marred by the recent collapse of cryptocurrency exchanges. Several large investment firms had filed applications for ETFs with the SEC, including BlackRock, ARK Invest, Invesco and Fidelity Investments. The approved ETFs have already begun trading Thursday on traditional SEC-regulated exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. An ETF is an investment fund that tracks the price of an underlying asset or index, much like a mutual fund, and can be bought and sold through a brokerage account.\n\n\n\nFor investors, \"an ETF might be perceived as safer than a direct investment through crypto exchanges,\" says Marcel Miu, a certified financial planner and founder of Simplify Wealth Planning. \"This is primarily due to the regulatory oversight governing ETFs \u2014 they are subject to the regulatory standards of financial markets that can offer a layer of security and transparency not always present in the crypto space.\"\n\nWhat this means for you\n\nAs a result of the approvals, investors can now buy ETFs through their existing brokerage accounts instead of dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges. Plus, they don't need to own crypto directly to have a stake in the market. In the past few weeks, the price of bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies has risen in anticipation of a new crop of potential buyers. However, the price of bitcoin tumbled on Tuesday after the SEC said that an announcement posted to X about bitcoin ETFs being approved was incorrect. As of late Thursday morning, bitcoin's price has regained those losses. Still, that doesn't change the risky nature of cryptocurrencies, which are highly speculative assets. \"Investing in a bitcoin ETF carries risks, similar to investing in cryptocurrencies directly,\" says Miu. \"The value of bitcoin can be highly volatile, influenced by factors such as regulatory news, technological developments and market sentiment.\" Indeed, bitcoin lost more than 75% of its value following the collapse of FTX in 2022, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges at the time. Although it has since bounced back, it remains volatile, with 5% to 10% daily price swings common.\n\nShould you invest in a bitcoin ETF?"

Approved applicants for bitcoin ETFs include Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Hashdex, BZX, VanExk, WisdomTree, and Franklin.\n\nApplications for bitcoin ETFs first popped up in 2013, but had been repeatedly rejected by the SEC up until now.\n\nTrading can begin as early as tomorrow, January 11, 2024, with over a dozen bitcoin ETF applicants \u2014 including Fidelity, BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark Investments, and 21Shares \u2014 eager to launch new products.\n\n\"We've fought with the SEC for ages, and they have been really slow in accepting the cryptocurrency market,\" says Stuart John Barton, CFP and co-founder of Volatility Shares. \"The SEC has lost enough battles and is now realizing they may have been leaning too conservative and need to loosen up. The SEC should be working with the investment community to improve products and make them better, not just stand in the way of innovation.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about bitcoin ETFs.\n\nInvest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether, and more with some of the best cryptocurrency exchanges. The best crypto trading platforms offer advanced chart tools, real-time market data, low trading fees, and account flexibility.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nA bitcoin ETF, not to be confused with a bitcoin futures ETF, is an exchange-traded fund that can directly hold bitcoin among other investable securities. Unlike bitcoin itself, which can only be bought and sold along the blockchain, bitcoin ETFs can be traded by retail investors through regular brokerage accounts.\n\n\"It opens the crypto market up to a broader world. Over time, we're likely to see a maturing market with more people trading and buying bitcoin,\" says Barton, \"In a more general sense, it just simplifies the process as most Americans have brokerage accounts. That means pretty much everybody has access to bitcoin ETFs.\"\n\nAlthough bitcoin futures ETFs were first introduced on the NYSE back in 2021, investors still haven't been able to invest directly in bitcoin through an ETF until today. But with bitcoin ETFs, people can more easily mitigate risk, simplify the investing process, and increase overall portfolio diversification.\n\nA bitcoin ETF doesn't have to just hold bitcoin, either. Just like any other exchange-traded fund, bitcoin ETFs can be a combination of crypto, stocks, bonds, and other commodities. Bitcoin ETFs, therefore, provide an easy way for investors to diversify their portfolios further.\n\nAdvantages of bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe launch of bitcoin ETFs could change the game of crypto trading by granting retail investors a more accessible means of exposure to the crypto world. Plus, ETFs are one of the most affordable ways to decrease volatility through portfolio diversification.\n\nInvesting in bitcoin through an ETF is now the simplest, least-risky way to get exposure to the crypto market. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and the market, in general, has been riddled with fraudulent activity and scams. However, more investors can get involved in the cryptocurrency market by being regulated by the SEC and trading on the traditional exchange.\n\nThat said, it's important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (even through an ETF) is still risky. Making bitcoin accessible through an ETF won't eliminate its hyper-volatile nature. So, only investors with a high-risk tolerance should invest in bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBarton theorizes how the bitcoin ETF may impact how bitcoin is traded down the line. \"Bitcoin ETFs are more investment-based than bitcoin futures ETFs are. I believe bitcoin ETFs will be more aimed at people who will put money in and leave it in there for a few years. If that's the case, we might actually see a reduction in the volatility of the bitcoin itself.\"\n\nWhere to invest in bitcoin ETFs\n\nLike most regulated securities on the market, you can invest in bitcoin ETFs through some of the best online brokerages and investment platforms. Dozens of platforms have already submitted applications to the SEC to begin trading bitcoin ETFs, and 11 have been approved so far, including Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Hashdex, BZX, VanExk, WisdomTree, and Franklin.\n\nFidelity, one of the most popular brokerages out there, has already posted several of its proposed bitcoin ETFs on its site. There are sure to be quite a few more brokers and popular cryptocurrency exchanges jumping on the opportunity to offer bitcoin ETFs to their users in the next few weeks.\n\nIf you're interested in investing in cryptocurrencies but don't know where to start, you can always consult with a financial advisor with crypto trading experience for professional insight."
