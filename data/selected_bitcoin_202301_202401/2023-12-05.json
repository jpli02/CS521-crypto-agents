        "content": "South Korean crypto traders appear to be growing in influence during the recent rally that has seen Bitcoin surge more than 50% to the highest price level in almost two years.\n\nIn November, the won overtook the dollar as the largest fiat trading pair in crypto for the first time, according to data compiled by CCData. That excludes trading volume for stablecoins and some other trading pairs, the market data provider said. Stablecoins are by far the largest trading pair for other cryptocurrencies. CCData began tracking the data in 2021."

        "content": "Bitcoin is building on its upward momentum, with the flagship cryptocurrency topping $44,000 for the first time since April 2022 on Tuesday.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was last higher by more than 4% to $43,794.99, according to Coin Metrics, extending gains from the previous day, as the drumbeat for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. grew louder. At one point, the coin traded as high as $44,903.45, its highest level since Apr. 7, 2022.\n\nTuesday's gains bring bitcoin up more than 160% for the year. Ether was higher by 1.6% on the day at $2,263.76. It's up 88% for 2023.\n\nBitcoin has been reaching new highs more frequently over the past several weeks. It broke through $40,000 over the weekend for the first time since April 2022, after beginning November around the $34,000 level and climbing incrementally to new year-to-date highs in between."

        "content": "Swiss City of Lugano Adopts Bitcoin and USDT as Payment for Taxes and Municipal Services\n\nThe city of Lugano in Switzerland has embraced digital currencies by enabling its citizens and businesses to utilize them for tax payments and municipal fees. In an official announcement on December 5, Lugano announced its acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) as payment methods for invoices issued by Lugano, using the Swiss cryptocurrency platform Bitcoin Suisse.\n\nUnder this new initiative, residents of Lugano can conveniently settle their taxes and various services by scanning the Swiss QR-bill code featured on their invoices and executing the transaction using their preferred mobile wallet and the chosen cryptocurrency.\n\nThis development is part of Lugano's broader Plan B, a collaborative venture with Tether aimed at leveraging Bitcoin technology to revolutionize the city's financial system. Bitcoin Suisse, serving as the technical partner in this integrated payment solution, supports Lugano in accepting Bitcoin and Tether payments for tax payment and other invoices related to municipal services.\n\nChief Product Officer at Bitcoin Suisse, Armin Schmid, said:\n\n\u201cIt is great to see that more and more Swiss municipalities are offering payments in cryptocurrencies as an option available to both citizens and companies, complementing traditional payment methods such as post-office counters and e-banking platforms.\u201d\n\nLugano has implemented blockchain-based solutions in the past, including integrating the Polygon chain on the MyLugano app, LVGA Points payment token, Lugano digital franc, and the 3Achain blockchain infrastructure. Other Swiss municipalities like Zug started accepting Bitcoin and Ether for tax payments from local individuals and companies in 2021, while Zermatt introduced the option to pay taxes with Bitcoin in partnership with Bitcoin Suisse in January 2020.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Bitcoin's bounceback d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - Cryptocurrencies - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe crypto bulls are back again. Bitcoin surged to $42,000 on Monday, its highest in nearly 20 months, marking a dramatic 150 per cent rise so far this year. After losing more than 60 per cent of its value in 2022, its climb back has sparked yet another wave of euphoric calls: industry veterans now project the token will breach $100,000 by the end of 2024, and at least $750,000 by 2026. Competitors including ethereum, dogecoin, solana and cardano are all up by double-digit percentages too.\n\nAs with any instrument, the investment case for crypto hinges on finding a convincing narrative. But unlike other assets, bitcoin has no intrinsic value, nor is it backed by anything. Some may argue that gold is not much different. Yet the glossy metal has been trusted as an effective store of wealth for millennia, and has been shown to offer some protection in down markets and times of high uncertainty \u2014 living up to its status as a hedge.\n\nThe same cannot be said for bitcoin. Its most consistent facet is its inconsistency. What the cryptocurrency ultimately offers, then, is a chance to speculate on the market\u2019s sentiment towards itself. And here the current pro-bitcoin sales pitch from its evangelists appears to be three-fold.\n\nFirst, they argue, a \u201crisk-on\u201d mood has returned to financial markets. In recent weeks, investors have become increasingly convinced that the US Federal Reserve has reached the end of its interest rate-raising cycle, and that cuts will happen sooner than it is signalling. With ample liquidity, and rate expectations lower, punting for something more speculative seems appealing. And rising bitcoin prices tend to generate a buying frenzy, which reinforces itself \u2014 until it inevitably pops.\n\nThe bulls are, however, also claiming that this time it is more than just hype. The second part of their pitch is that the closure of the most high-profile criminal cases that have hung over the crypto-market for the past year is akin to a cleansing moment. Last month the US successfully prosecuted Sam Bankman-Fried, former chief executive of FTX, for fraud, while Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, pleaded guilty to charges related to money laundering and sanctions breaches.\n\nThird, crypto optimists expect signs of a possible US regulatory approval for spot bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, among others, to drive a wave of crypto fund products backed by mainstream asset managers. Wider institutional adoption by serious players, they claim, gives cryptocurrency credibility.\n\nBut the buy-and-hold case is full of holes. Crypto\u2019s brushes with the law are far from over. In the nascent industry, the authorities are still cautiously calibrating regulations and hearing legal cases. Gary Gensler, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, recently said the sector was rife with \u201cfraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering\u201d.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF applications, if approved, may attract more investors who seek crypto exposure yet are fearful of theft and lost coins in digital wallets and exchanges. But they do not protect investors from crypto\u2019s volatility. As it is, Grayscale\u2019s private trusts tracking cryptocurrencies are trading at absurd multiples of their underlying value. For mainstream asset managers, ETFs are also just another way to collect fees from investors seeking crypto exposure, not necessarily a backing of the asset class itself.\n\nWhat remains of the bull case, then, is the flimsy argument that there appears to be some appetite for speculation, and that bitcoin is a speculative asset. This is basically the \u201cgreater fool theory\u201d playbook for investors: all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone silly enough to buy the asset at an even higher price. That will last, until it doesn\u2019t. Bitcoin has collapsed before; it will surely do so again.\n\nLetter in response to this editorial:\n\nBitcoin loses its lustre next to gold bullion / From Alex J Pollock, Senior Fellow, Mises Institute, Lake Forest, IL, US"
