CNBC\n\nSeb True is a full-stack engineer who made the move to Lisbon over the summer. The British national initially traveled to Portugal on what was meant to be a short trip to make a presentation at the monthly bitcoin gathering. Soon after his arrival, he was hooked and committed to a three-month sublet. True quit his full-time job so he could focus on traveling the world and teaching people about bitcoin from the perspective of sound money and the philosophy of libertarianism. He has dubbed his educational modules The Bitcoin Student, and he's looking to expand the brand by capitalizing on his engineering background. Lisbon has been a relief for True, who previously ran underground workshops in Egypt where bitcoin is illegal. \"Apparently they throw people in jail for talking about it and just working on it or doing anything with it,\" he said. \"That's actually the first place I started giving presentations on bitcoin.\" He says he knew the risks but ultimately ignored warnings about his safety, because he felt the population could greatly benefit from learning more about decentralized virtual money that existed outside the reach of governments or central banks. \"It's a country that has experienced over 50% inflation just this year, people are suffering, they don't understand why and they don't know who to blame,\" continued True. \"Their view was, 'Oh, bitcoin, someone controls that, too, surely, so it's not going to be any better,'\" he said, adding that it didn't take long to \"orange pill\" them, a phrase used by bitcoiners to describe the process of indoctrinating someone in the ways of bitcoin. True has now shifted his focus to Portugal, describing Lisbon, in particular, as the ideal base to grow his enterprise. \"The people here that I'm meeting are doing things, actually creating content, they're active about making a difference, and they are interested in collaborating,\" True told CNBC. \"I've already had people contacting me asking to make content for me or for my project, not for any money, not for any fame ... but just because they're passionate, because they believe in the mission,\" continued True. \"They believe in the idea, and that's really what's made me think, 'Wow, I should really stay here. This is where the community clearly is.'\"\n\nLisbon's skyline, showing the city's Ponte 25 de Abril spanning the river Tagus. Stephen Knowles Photography | Moment | Getty Images\n\nTax breaks on bitcoin\n\nBefore making the move from Asia to Europe, Chan pored over tax law in the European Union, narrowing down the ideal jurisdiction to either Switzerland or Portugal. \"If you know anything about Switzerland, it's a millionaires' and billionaires' paradise,\" said Chan. \"Looking at me, I don't think I've achieved that level of success yet, so I chose the poor man's Switzerland.\" The tax perks in Portugal are certainly a big draw. The resident-non-habitual (NHR) status is a fiscal regime that in some cases grants expats living in Portugal total exemption from paying taxes on their income for a period of up to 10 years. In addition, unlike the U.S., which treats virtual currency as property, taxing it in a manner similar to stocks or real property, Portugal views cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. That distinction is a game-changer with respect to taxes. Up until the end of 2022, capital gains resulting from crypto transactions, such as cashing out and crypto-to-crypto trades, were not subject to personal income taxes. The government has since added more caveats to its crypto tax breaks, including a requirement that an investor hold a digital asset for more than a year before selling in order to avoid paying taxes on the sale. This means that gains from buying or selling cryptocurrency, as with other fiat currencies, are not taxed if the trader holds on to their coins for at least 12 months. Meanwhile, profits made on crypto held for less than a year is taxed at a rate of 28%. \"This makes Portugal a really attractive place for crypto users to live,\" explained Shehan Chandrasekera, a CPA and head of tax strategy at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.io. The only exception to the country's generous crypto scheme relates to companies registered in Portugal that deal in crypto. These businesses face some taxes under certain circumstances, like if they earn cryptocurrency by providing services in Portugal.\n\nCyclists photographed in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2018.

It doesn't require owning any property, and unlike other crypto tax havens, such as Puerto Rico, foreigners aren't required to spend a certain number of days in the country. Citizens of the European Union have the right to permanent residence in Portugal, and for non-EU citizens, it offers expats a few paths to residency, including the golden visa and the D7 Visa (also known as the retirement visa or passive income visa), both of which tend to attract wealthy foreigners. The Portuguese golden visa is given to those who buy property, or invest a certain amount of money in the country. There are also steps that involve getting a tax identification number, opening a bank account and formally applying for residency. Companies such as Plan B Passport streamline the application process for expats. Plan B CEO Katie Ananina tells CNBC the company has helped hundreds of people from countries such as the U.S., the U.K., Australia and Canada obtain a second passport in one of seven countries, including Portugal. Plan B works in tandem with each government's residence- or citizenship-by-investment programs. One drawback to Lisbon's burgeoning popularity: As more crypto fans flood the city, some of the longtime natives are complaining about rising prices, similar to other tech hubs around the world. \"There's been quite a sort of influx of foreigners that have come in recently,\" says Ethena's Young. \"And there's been a bit of pushback around property prices, what's going on with sort of the prices in some of the restaurants and stuff like that. But as a foreigner who's come here, I have no complaints.\"\n\n'It's just paradise'\n\nWout Deley \u2014 who has been researching cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology since 2013 \u2014 was working as an international sales manager for a galvanization company in Ghent, Belgium, when he decided to sell his house, invest in tokens and hit the road. After a few months traveling through Europe during the early days of the Covid pandemic, he ultimately settled in Portugal. Deley invested two-thirds of the house-sale proceeds in cryptocurrency and then lived off the final third. \"At any given time, I have maybe \u2014 at a maximum \u2014 10,000 euros ($11,450) in my bank account,\" said Deley. \"All the rest is always in crypto.\" For Deley, establishing residency in Portugal was a no-brainer. \"Cryptocurrencies in Belgium are massively taxed, and I was looking at seven figures of profit,\" said Deley, who said that he would have faced a tax obligation of close to 40% had he remained in Belgium. \"You want to double your profit? Just move to Portugal,\" he said.\n\nPra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio is a popular tourist destination in Lisbon's city center. Imazins | Image Bank Film | Getty Images\n\nDeley lives in Lagos in the southwest tip of Portugal. He says that he found a villa available as a long-term rental which was \"very cheap\" and that was enough to establish residency. The living is easy in Portugal, according to Deley, who says the southern coastline of the Algarve offers the perks of Los Angeles \u2014 a warm climate and great surf \u2014 but without the traffic jams. And there is a solid social scene. \"It's full of expats. It's just paradise,\" continued Deley. He says that he knows of at least three bitcoin billionaires who live nearby \u2014 plus another 12 people at least, mostly from the U.K., who are moving to Portugal in the next few months for the crypto tax benefits. Deley doesn't speak Portuguese, but he says that's not a problem because everyone speaks English. He is also surrounded by a lot of like-minded crypto investors. \"Everyone has cryptocurrency here. Everyone knows bitcoin. Everyone has it,\" he said. Deley says the crypto investor migration is good for Portugal, too. \"They have a huge brain drain. Younger people are leaving. So they're trying to be more open to people with capital, digital nomads,\" said Deley. Meanwhile, Didi Taihuttu of the 'Bitcoin Family' wants to disrupt the typical expat experience in Portugal by building a crypto village. The family is currently shopping for real estate. They've narrowed their options down to three different plots of land, one as big as 250,000 acres, in the Algarve. The plan is to run the community in a decentralized fashion, in which the land is divvied up by the square meter and sold as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, in order to signify ownership. Taihuttu also wants to mine for bitcoin with solar and wind power and then use the heat produced by the rigs to warm houses in the winter, in a sort of closed-loop system. The working plan, for now, is to use a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, to govern the community. DAOs run on blockchain technology. \"We want to build a decentralized lifestyle, which is the future,\" he said. In the meantime, the Taihuttus found an abandoned inn and are retrofitting it to be the first web3 hotel in the Algarve that is financed and owned by the community."

Lisbon has been a relief for True, who previously ran underground workshops in Egypt where bitcoin is illegal. \"Apparently they throw people in jail for talking about it and just working on it or doing anything with it,\" he said. \"That's actually the first place I started giving presentations on bitcoin.\" He says he knew the risks but ultimately ignored warnings about his safety, because he felt the population could greatly benefit from learning more about decentralized virtual money that existed outside the reach of governments or central banks. \"It's a country that has experienced over 50% inflation just this year, people are suffering, they don't understand why and they don't know who to blame,\" continued True. \"Their view was, 'Oh, bitcoin, someone controls that, too, surely, so it's not going to be any better,'\" he said, adding that it didn't take long to \"orange pill\" them, a phrase used by bitcoiners to describe the process of indoctrinating someone in the ways of bitcoin. True has now shifted his focus to Portugal, describing Lisbon, in particular, as the ideal base to grow his enterprise. \"The people here that I'm meeting are doing things, actually creating content, they're active about making a difference, and they are interested in collaborating,\" True told CNBC. \"I've already had people contacting me asking to make content for me or for my project, not for any money, not for any fame ... but just because they're passionate, because they believe in the mission,\" continued True. \"They believe in the idea, and that's really what's made me think, 'Wow, I should really stay here. This is where the community clearly is.'\"\n\nLisbon's skyline, showing the city's Ponte 25 de Abril spanning the river Tagus.

The resident-non-habitual (NHR) status is a fiscal regime that in some cases grants expats living in Portugal total exemption from paying taxes on their income for a period of up to 10 years. In addition, unlike the U.S., which treats virtual currency as property, taxing it in a manner similar to stocks or real property, Portugal views cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. That distinction is a game-changer with respect to taxes. Up until the end of 2022, capital gains resulting from crypto transactions, such as cashing out and crypto-to-crypto trades, were not subject to personal income taxes. The government has since added more caveats to its crypto tax breaks, including a requirement that an investor hold a digital asset for more than a year before selling in order to avoid paying taxes on the sale. This means that gains from buying or selling cryptocurrency, as with other fiat currencies, are not taxed if the trader holds on to their coins for at least 12 months. Meanwhile, profits made on crypto held for less than a year is taxed at a rate of 28%. \"This makes Portugal a really attractive place for crypto users to live,\" explained Shehan Chandrasekera, a CPA and head of tax strategy at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.io. The only exception to the country's generous crypto scheme relates to companies registered in Portugal that deal in crypto. These businesses face some taxes under certain circumstances, like if they earn cryptocurrency by providing services in Portugal.\n\nCyclists photographed in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2018.

It doesn't require owning any property, and unlike other crypto tax havens, such as Puerto Rico, foreigners aren't required to spend a certain number of days in the country. Citizens of the European Union have the right to permanent residence in Portugal, and for non-EU citizens, it offers expats a few paths to residency, including the golden visa and the D7 Visa (also known as the retirement visa or passive income visa), both of which tend to attract wealthy foreigners. The Portuguese golden visa is given to those who buy property, or invest a certain amount of money in the country. There are also steps that involve getting a tax identification number, opening a bank account and formally applying for residency. Companies such as Plan B Passport streamline the application process for expats. Plan B CEO Katie Ananina tells CNBC the company has helped hundreds of people from countries such as the U.S., the U.K., Australia and Canada obtain a second passport in one of seven countries, including Portugal. Plan B works in tandem with each government's residence- or citizenship-by-investment programs. One drawback to Lisbon's burgeoning popularity: As more crypto fans flood the city, some of the longtime natives are complaining about rising prices, similar to other tech hubs around the world. \"There's been quite a sort of influx of foreigners that have come in recently,\" says Ethena's Young. \"And there's been a bit of pushback around property prices, what's going on with sort of the prices in some of the restaurants and stuff like that. But as a foreigner who's come here, I have no complaints.\"\n\n'It's just paradise'\n\nWout Deley \u2014 who has been researching cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology since 2013 \u2014 was working as an international sales manager for a galvanization company in Ghent, Belgium, when he decided to sell his house, invest in tokens and hit the road. After a few months traveling through Europe during the early days of the Covid pandemic, he ultimately settled in Portugal. Deley invested two-thirds of the house-sale proceeds in cryptocurrency and then lived off the final third. \"At any given time, I have maybe \u2014 at a maximum \u2014 10,000 euros ($11,450) in my bank account,\" said Deley. \"All the rest is always in crypto.\" For Deley, establishing residency in Portugal was a no-brainer. \"Cryptocurrencies in Belgium are massively taxed, and I was looking at seven figures of profit,\" said Deley, who said that he would have faced a tax obligation of close to 40% had he remained in Belgium. \"You want to double your profit? Just move to Portugal,\" he said.\n\nPra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio is a popular tourist destination in Lisbon's city center.

He says that he found a villa available as a long-term rental which was \"very cheap\" and that was enough to establish residency. The living is easy in Portugal, according to Deley, who says the southern coastline of the Algarve offers the perks of Los Angeles \u2014 a warm climate and great surf \u2014 but without the traffic jams. And there is a solid social scene. \"It's full of expats. It's just paradise,\" continued Deley. He says that he knows of at least three bitcoin billionaires who live nearby \u2014 plus another 12 people at least, mostly from the U.K., who are moving to Portugal in the next few months for the crypto tax benefits. Deley doesn't speak Portuguese, but he says that's not a problem because everyone speaks English. He is also surrounded by a lot of like-minded crypto investors. \"Everyone has cryptocurrency here. Everyone knows bitcoin. Everyone has it,\" he said. Deley says the crypto investor migration is good for Portugal, too. \"They have a huge brain drain. Younger people are leaving. So they're trying to be more open to people with capital, digital nomads,\" said Deley. Meanwhile, Didi Taihuttu of the 'Bitcoin Family' wants to disrupt the typical expat experience in Portugal by building a crypto village. The family is currently shopping for real estate. They've narrowed their options down to three different plots of land, one as big as 250,000 acres, in the Algarve. The plan is to run the community in a decentralized fashion, in which the land is divvied up by the square meter and sold as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, in order to signify ownership. Taihuttu also wants to mine for bitcoin with solar and wind power and then use the heat produced by the rigs to warm houses in the winter, in a sort of closed-loop system. The working plan, for now, is to use a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, to govern the community. DAOs run on blockchain technology. \"We want to build a decentralized lifestyle, which is the future,\" he said. In the meantime, the Taihuttus found an abandoned inn and are retrofitting it to be the first web3 hotel in the Algarve that is financed and owned by the community."
