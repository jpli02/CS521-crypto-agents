        "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrating the $250 Million Pizza Order - Investopedia",
        "content": "Each year, May 22 marks the anniversary of when a Florida man paid for two pizzas in the first Bitcoin transaction. The day has become legendary, less because it was the first commercial use of bitcoins, but because of Bitcoin\u2019s worth in the following years. For the two pizzas, the man in question paid 10,000 bitcoins, which, as of Sept. 11, 2023, is worth over $250 million.\n\nOn May 22, 2010, now known as \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day,\u201d Laszlo Hanyecz, the Florida man, agreed to pay 10,000 bitcoins for the delivery of two Papa John\u2019s pizzas. On the Bitcoin Talk forum, Hanyecz reached out for help. \u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas \u2026 like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day,\u201d Hanyecz wrote.\n\n\u201cI like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I\u2019m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don\u2019t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a \u2018breakfast platter\u2019 at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you\u2019re happy!\u201d\n\nA British man took up Hanyecz\u2019s offer and bought the two pizzas for him in exchange for 10,000 bitcoins. Even then, the recipient of the bitcoins got a bargain, paying $25 for the pizzas, while 10,000 bitcoins were then worth around $41.\n\nSince that purchase, Hanyeczs\u2019 pizzas have become far more costly. Nine months after the purchase, Bitcoin reached parity with the U.S. dollar, making the two pizzas worth $10,000. In 2015, the fifth anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, the two pizzas were valued at $2.4 million. On May 22, 2023, Bitcoin was at just over $26,850, making the pizzas worth \u2026 you get the point.\n\nDespite the massive rise in the price of Bitcoin, Hanyecz says he is not phased about his deal. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,\u201d Hanyecz has said.\n\nWhat Was Bitcoin's Highest Price? As of September 2023, Bitcoin reached its all-time peak in November 2021, exceeding $65,000 per bitcoin.\n\nWhat Type of Transaction Is Bitcoin Mostly Used for? Bitcoin is primarily used for digital transactions. This includes ecommerce purchases, peer-to-peer transfers, and cross-border payments. Moreover, it's used for international transactions and, increasingly, for banking by those who don't have access to traditional financial institutions. Among these transactions, though, are those linked with illicit activities, such as darknet trades.\n\nWhat Is the Average Number of Bitcoin Transactions Daily? As of 2023, there are an average of almost 500,000 Bitcoin transactions within the blockchain per day, a significant increase from previous years. This surge reflects the growing adoption and use of Bitcoin for digital transactions across the globe.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin's value has gone up significantly since the first Bitcoin Pizza Day, illustrating the cryptocurrency's impressive growth since its early days, when its worth was fungible for not more than a couple of pizzas. The rise in Bitcoin's value is a testament to its increasing acceptance and use in digital transactions worldwide. However, Bitcoin has been highly volatile. Its price can fluctuate rapidly, potentially leading to momentous gains and significant losses. Thus, while the growth trajectory of Bitcoin attracts investors, caution and informed decision-making are paramount when investing in this cryptocurrency because of its elevated risk."

        "content": "Three finalists have been selected for the Bitcoin Alpha Competition, a crowd-sourced campaign to find the next top Bitcoin fund manager. The manager with the most promising approach for generating alpha in the bitcoin market will be awarded $1 million USD in seed capital and announced on the Main Stage of the Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference on Friday, October 13th by Samara Alpha Management.\n\n\n\nSamara Alpha Management and Bitcoin Magazine PRO reviewed more than 150 applications from traditional finance and digital asset fund managers, and have selected the following finalists: Andrey Aakelyan (Theta Digital), Jaron Abbott (Armor Strategy), and Maximilian Pace (Animus Technologies). Of these three, one winner will walk away with one million dollars in seed funding \u2013 as well as all the necessary operational infrastructure to launch and run their fund strategy \u2013 thanks to the generous support of Samara Alpha Management and their signature seeding platform.\n\n\n\nBelow are insights into each of the finalists\u2019 fund strategies:\n\n\n\nAndrey Arakelyan - Theta Digital\n\nTheta Digital is focused on taking discretionary Long or Short positions in Bitcoin Futures at varying timescales to achieve incremental alpha denominated in BTC preserved by systematic risk management.\n\nJaron Abbott - Armor Strategies\n\nThe Armor Strategy utilizes a portfolio of indicators to quantitatively describe and measure the psychological behavior of panic selling in its early stages. Signals are aggregated and translated to predict and extract alpha from impending price moves.\n\nMaximilian Pace - Animus Technologies\n\nAnimus Technologies is an AI-platform designed to develop data-driven trading strategies for cryptocurrencies. The result, developed over the past 6 years, is a systematic solution to reducing market volatility and enhancing investor returns over market cycles.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with Roy Tse, Chief Risk Officer at Samara Alpha Management, for his thoughts on the competition and why Samara Alpha Management has made such a decisive move into the Bitcoin ecosystem:\n\n\u201cWe have a belief that we can find interesting managers that are really adding accretive value to the Bitcoin space. At Samara, a lot of us believe in the power of Bitcoin and what it can do for the world.\n\nEvery day, we hear tons of great investment ideas and strategies. Given the current regulatory environment, and the disjointed-ness of the exchanges and markets, that is why many of these market opportunities emerge, similar to the early days of other traditional finance businesses that we\u2019ve seen such as mortgage-backed trading and CLOs. Any time there is a new industry, there is a chance for novel financial strategies to succeed. But, to capitalize on that, the difficulty lies in the environment to set up the required infrastructure in such a new market, like Bitcoin and digital assets.\n\nWe are Bitcoin maximalists, we want to increase adoption. If folks can\u2019t enter the market because of things like setting up their fund, or not knowing who to call \u2013 those are the pressure points we want to alleviate.\n\nBecause of that, we created the Samara seeding platform, which is essentially a fund in a box. We provide the ability for a manager to come in with a great idea and subscribe to a technology platform complete with all of the different disciplines needed to set up a Bitcoin investment management company. You have fund administrator connectivity with data coming through from the exchanges, pre-existing exchange partners and accounts, risk management functions complete with analytics, calculations and customization, liquidity management functions etc.\n\nThe million dollar prize for the Bitcoin Alpha Competition is very exciting for us, but the true excitement we have is for the seeding platform \u2014 being able to provide this functionality to fund managers with great strategies and helping them bring their ideas to life at the push of a button.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the crowning of the Bitcoin Alpha Competition winner at Bitcoin Amsterdam fast approaching, stay tuned for the announcement on Friday, October 13th for who will take home the $1 million prize as well as full access to Samara\u2019s fund management platform.\n\n\n\nFor media inquiries and additional information on the competition, please contact: kristyna.mazankova@btcmedia.org\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "The Lightning Network Makes Bitcoin Unstoppable: Bitcoin Backstage with David Marcus - Nasdaq",
        "content": "One of the biggest challenges Bitcoin faces is scalability. Transactions can be slow and costly, making mainchain settlement less efficient for everyday transactional use. Enter the Lightning Network, an innovative solution that has the potential to make Bitcoin unstoppable. In the latest episode of Bitcoin Backstage, we explore the concept behind the Lightning Network, its role in Bitcoin's growth, the involvement of David Marcus with LightSpark, and the unstoppable nature of Bitcoin itself.\n\nUnderstanding the Lightning Network\n\nBefore we delve into the incredible impact the Lightning Network has had on Bitcoin, it is essential to understand how it works. The Lightning Network is a second-layer, off-chain scaling solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It addresses the scalability issue by enabling faster and cheaper transactions. The Lightning Network has revolutionized the way Bitcoin transactions are conducted.\n\nThe Concept Behind the Lightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network operates by creating payment channels between two parties, allowing them to transact without broadcasting every transaction to the blockchain. These channels are then connected to form a vast network, enabling payments to be routed through multiple nodes securely and efficiently.\n\nHow the Lightning Network Enhances Bitcoin\n\nThe Lightning Network enhances Bitcoin by significantly reducing transaction fees and speeding up settlment times. With the Lightning Network, users can make near-instantaneous transactions, making it ideal for micropayments and everyday transactions. This scalability solution opens up new possibilities for Bitcoin to be used as a medium of exchange, similar to traditional currencies.\n\nBefore the Lightning Network, Bitcoin faced challenges in terms of scalability. As the number of users increased, the Bitcoin blockchain became congested, resulting in high transaction fees and slower confirmation times. This made it impractical for small-value transactions and hindered Bitcoin's potential as a widely accepted form of payment.\n\nHowever, with the Lightning Network, these limitations are overcome. By conducting transactions off-chain, the Lightning Network relieves the majority of the burden on the main blockchain, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. This scalability solution has made Bitcoin more accessible and practical for everyday use.\n\nThe Lightning Network has also sparked innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Developers are now creating applications and services that leverage the Lightning Network's capabilities, such as instant payment processors, decentralized exchanges, and microtransaction platforms. These developments are expanding the use cases of Bitcoin and driving its adoption.\n\nThe Lightning Network has revolutionized the Bitcoin landscape by providing a scalable and efficient solution for transactions. Its concept of payment channels and off-chain transactions has opened up new possibilities for Bitcoin to be used as a medium of exchange. As the Lightning Network continues to evolve, we can expect even more exciting developments in the world of Bitcoin.\n\nDavid Marcus: A Key Player in Bitcoin's Evolution\n\nLet's take a closer look at David Marcus's role in the Bitcoin ecosystem and his vision for its future.\n\nMarcus's Vision for the Future of Bitcoin\n\nAs a prominent figure in the financial technology world and the Co-Founder and CEO of LightSpark, David Marcus has been vocal about his optimism for Bitcoin and its underlying technology. He believes that the Lightning Network has the potential to unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin, making it more accessible and efficient for global transactions. Marcus envisions a future where Bitcoin becomes a mainstream medium of exchange, providing financial inclusion to the unbanked and revolutionizing cross-border payments.\n\nThe Unstoppable Nature of Bitcoin\n\nFactors Making Bitcoin Unstoppable\n\nBitcoin's decentralized nature, robust blockchain technology, and scarce supply all contribute to its resilience and immutability. These factors make it highly resistant to censorship and external control, making it a truly people-centric currency.\n\nThe Role of the Lightning Network in Bitcoin's Unstoppability\n\nThe Lightning Network strengthens Bitcoin's unstoppable nature by introducing a layer of trustless, decentralized payment channels. By utilizing these channels, Bitcoin transactions occur off-chain, making them less susceptible to network congestion, censorship, and high fees. The Lightning Network ensures that Bitcoin retains its unstoppable nature on a global scale.\n\nLooking Ahead: The Future of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network's Potential Impact on Cryptocurrency\n\nThe Lightning Network sets a precedent for scalability solutions on Bitcoin. Its success demonstrates the feasibility of off-chain payment channels, inspiring innovation and development within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe Lightning Network has emerged as a game-changer for Bitcoin, addressing its scalability challenges and propelling it towards mainstream adoption. With its potential to make transactions faster, cheaper, and more efficient, the Lightning Network is instrumental in making Bitcoin unstoppable. Combined with visionaries like David Marcus, Bitcoin's future looks bright, with the unstoppable nature of this revolutionary cryptocurrency set to transform the way we transact and interact with money.\n\nNews Recap of the Week (9/22/2023)\n\nAnti CBDC Bill\n\nThe First Anti-CBDC [Central Bank Digital Currency] Bill in the USA was passed out of the Financial Services Committee. The Bill was brought up by whip Tom Emmer. This bill prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC directly or indirectly to individuals or maintaining accounts on behalf of individuals. This is to thwart the ever expanding digital surveillance state that has been plaguing the world.\n\nFree Julian Assange\n\nThis week a cross-party delegation of Australian Politicians met with US officials, members of congress, and civil rights groups to urge the US government to abandon efforts to prosecute Wikileaks' Founder Julian Assange who is being accused of leaking classified US military documents. He is facing up to 175 in an American high security prison. What happened to freedom of press?\n\nNigeria is Bullish on Bitcoin\n\nCryptocurrency usage is growing as the country of Nigeria grapples with a weakening currency and soaring inflation. Nigeria\u2019s volume of crypto transitions has grown 9% year-over-year to over 56.7 billion dollars between July 2022 and July 2023.\n\nEurope tightens its grip on Crypto\n\nEurope plans to tighten its grip on crypto in 2026. European Union's eighth version of the directive on administrative cooperation or the DAC8 law will come into full force. This law is designed to help EU tax authorities track digital asset transactions and any efforts made trying to reduce potential tax fraud and evasion.\n\nStanford University returns money\n\nStanford University will return the $5.5M in donations from Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX. This donation was done directly by Joe Bankman, Sam\u2019s father and a long time faculty member at Stanford. The same man who was unhappy with his compensation at FTX, triggering an email to SBF asking for more money, pulling the \u2018I am telling your mother\u2019 while CC\u2019d Sam\u2019s mom Barbara.\n\nUS hits new milestone\n\nThe US has officially hit a new milestone of gross national debt just passed $33 Trillion dollars meaning it has spiked $1.58 Trillion since the debt ceiling was lifted in June.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
