        "title": "Bitcoin dips below $30,000 to start the week as crypto investors refocus on economic concerns - CNBC",
        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nCryptocurrencies fell on Monday as investors put excitement from Ethereum's \"Shapella\" upgrade behind them and refocused on upcoming bank earnings and recession concerns.\n\nBitcoin fell more than 3.3% to $29,478.54, according to Coin Metrics, falling below the key $30,000 it hit last week for the first time since June. Meanwhile, ether was lower by 2.4% but maintained the $2,000 it broke through last week.\n\nCrypto is coming off a winning week in which prices were boosted by optimism around Ethereum's latest tech upgrade, dubbed \"Shapella\" (also known as \"Shanghai\"). The update is meant to bring greater liquidity to the network by allowing \"locked up\" ether to be withdrawn and ultimately draw in more institutional interest in the long term. Bitcoin and ether advanced 8% and 12%, respectively, for the week.\n\nThis week, it wouldn't be surprising to see a small correction in prices, according to Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank, and there could be some selling pressure as some investors may want to take profits from the previous week.\n\nWhile crypto was rallying, \"Friday's U.S. stock market showed unstable movements as stronger-than-expected consumer sentiment and Fed's Waller's speech strengthened the possibility of another rate hike in May,\" Hasegawa said. \"Nevertheless, the Fed Funds futures market has already priced in more than 80% chance of a 25bp hike in May, so pressures from macro factors on the price of bitcoin is expected to be limited.\"\n\nCrypto investors are watching bank earnings this week for more insight about the health of the sector and possibility of a coming recession. Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week too.\n\n\"We haven't seen crypto perform in a high-rate, slowing growth environment until now,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investing company eToro. \"It's anyone's guess how crypto acts during a recession.\"\n\nFor this week, any downside potential \"should not be severe\" or keep bitcoin from continuing on its uptrend, Hasegawa said."

        "title": "Bitcoin's chart has some eerie parallels to gold in the 1970s - CNBC",
        "content": "Many investors have dismissed the notion that bitcoin could be a type of digital gold since the cryptocurrency has been trading like a speculative risk asset for much of the past two years. But about 50 years ago, gold did the same thing, Morgan Stanley said in a recent note. If bitcoin's current moves continue to follow those of gold in the 1970s, the cryptocurrency could be in for some tough times ahead. In 1971, individuals could no longer convert U.S. dollars to a specified amount of gold. Since 2008, governments have become more reliant on central banks creating new fiat currency \u2014 money that isn't backed by a commodity \u2014 to provide support in times of crisis, according to Morgan Stanley's note. That's different from bitcoin, which has a limited supply. In the '70s, \"gold was tracking the rising rate of consumer price inflation (CPI), which was largely a result of the recent explosion of fiat money supply,\" said Sheena Shah, a strategist at Morgan Stanley and a coauthor of the note. \"Bitcoin, on a logarithmic scale, has so far followed a similar path to the price speculation of gold in the 1970s, which also seemed to follow a four year cycle.\" Starting in 1971, gold prices quadrupled within four years as the U.S. dollar money supply grew rapidly, the strategist said. \"That wasn't the height of the speculation, however: from August 1976 to January 1980, the price of gold rose eightfold from $102 to $850.\" \"As the gold price was still managed for the first few years, the similarities may be a statistical coincidence \u2026 more likely, in our view, is that both were driven by similar speculation cycles,\" she added. Bitcoin fans have long highlighted its potential to act as a \"digital gold\" because it's divisible, scarce and doesn't rely on a central issuer. They also once argued that bitcoin offered a hedge against equities, but last year's market havoc threw cold water on that idea as the cryptocurrency's correlation with stocks hit an all-time high . At the end of March, that correlation fell to its lowest since 2021 , while bitcoin's correlation with gold has been climbing. After the Federal Reserve loosened monetary policy to support the economy at the start of the Covid pandemic, bitcoin outperformed gold 2.9x over the three-and-a-half-year period, Bernstein recently noted. This year, banking crisis fears in the U.S. helped push bitcoin to even greater gains. \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom and Gabriel Cortes contributed reporting"

        "content": "For Eddy Zillan\u2019s bar mitzvah in 2012, his parents gave him $5,000 to start an investment fund. They expected him to start dabbling in stocks. Instead, he began buying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nEddy saved up another $7,000 from summers spent working at a tennis club and other jobs, adding that to his investment fund for a total $12,000 in principal.\n\nAnybody who has been following cryptocurrencies knows where this story is going: Eddy\u2019s $12,000 investment is now worth well over $500,000, a return exceeding 4,100% in just a few years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a prodigy, but he\u2019s close,\u201d says Eddy\u2019s father, Gary Zillan. Eddy, now 18, is a high school senior in Orange, Ohio, near Cleveland. He hopes to study dentistry next year at Case Western Reserve University. But if that doesn\u2019t work out, he has a Plan B, since he just launched a company that provides tutorials and insights on cryptocurrencies. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll be a multimillionaire by the time he\u2019s my age,\u201d says his father, who is 46.\n\nEddy Zillan, 18, of Orange, Ohio, has amassed well over $500,000 worth of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. (Photo courtesy of Eddy Zillan)\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are suddenly the hottest investment since the dot-com bubble, after a stunning surge in value during the last year.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, has soared by more than 700% in 2017. Ethereum is up a mind-boggling 3,900% \u2014 and early purchasers are suddenly watching the zeroes multiply on their accounts. Many crypto investors are reluctant to talk about their holdings, since alt-currencies are still associated with illicit activity, and they tend to appeal to non-traditionalists in the first place. But we found some willing to tell us their experiences. There are also plenty of detractors who insist cryptocurrencies are Ponzi schemes or worse. Yet regulators may soon bestow validity on cryptocurrencies by allowing broader investments, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), to track their value.\n\nThe origins of bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a digital payment system launched in 2009 by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. A network of coders with powerful computers has slowly \u201cmined\u201d more bitcoin since then by running complex computations that adhere to a set of founding principles, making bitcoin a kind of crowd-sourced currency. The market value of all bitcoin in the world is around $132 billion at current prices, roughly comparable to the current value of McDonald\u2019s (MCD).\n\nStory continues\n\nOther cryptocurrencies, sometimes referred to as \u201caltcoins,\u201d have emerged as well, including ether, the token of the blockchain network ethereum ($32 billion in market cap), ripple ($9 billion), litecoin ($3.7 billion) and dash ($3.3 billion).\n\nIn a recent Yahoo Finance survey, 77% of respondents told us they have never purchased bitcoin \u2014 but of those, 11% said they\u2019re planning to, and 38% said they\u2019re thinking about it. As more people buy in, that interest alone could send the crypto rally even higher.\n\n[See the full results of our bitcoin survey, conducted online Nov. 10-13.]\n\nOrdinary people can buy cryptocurrencies through services like Coinbase, SpectroCoin or Kraken, usually by linking a bank account or credit card and following simple instructions. (Disclosure: I own a small amount of bitcoin.)\n\nOf 1,011 poll respondents saying they\u2019ve purchased Bitcoin, 71% have made money. Source: Yahoo Finance survey conducted via SurveyMonkey\n\nCritics such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and hedge-fund titan Ray Dalio see cryptocurrencies as a craze that will eventually implode, akin to tulips or Enron. But Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Mark Cuban are believers, and many investors think bitcoin and other digital currencies are like the Internet in 1995 \u2014 a transformative technology about to erupt.\n\nThe money is certainly real.\n\nBitcoin as currency\n\nPeter Saddington of Atlanta first read about bitcoin in 2011, and bought some for less than $3 per coin. With bitcoin now trading at around $7,500, the return on those early investments is around 250,000%. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d says Saddington, 35, an entrepreneur who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and three master\u2019s degrees. \u201cWhat solidified my confidence that this is worth investing in is that the code is based on math. It can\u2019t really be turned off.\u201d\n\n[Had a wild experience with cryptocurrencies? Let us know! Email us at rickjnewman@yahoo.com.]\n\nIn October, Saddington cashed out 45 bitcoins to buy a 2015 Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n, for the equivalent of about $238,000. He and the seller made the transaction in bitcoin, without using a traditional bank. The transaction fees totaled $7.50.\n\nSaddington, who runs a cryptocurrency social network called TheBitcoin.pub, deliberately sought a supercar he could purchase with bitcoin in order to tout the credibility of the currency. \u201cBuying the Lambo with bitcoin is proof it can be used for real transactions, buying really cool stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only used by criminals.\u201d\n\nAs for how much bitcoin he still holds, he says: \u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to wonder about.\u201d\n\nPeter Saddington of Atlanta, 35, in front of the Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n he bought in October for 45 Bitcoin, or $238,000.\n\nA California wine executive we interviewed also tried to buy a fancy car with bitcoin \u2014 and he\u2019s grateful the transaction fell through.\n\nThe 55-year-old saw a friend ask about bitcoin in a Facebook post a few years ago. He researched it and began buying a few coins per month, at prices ranging from $225 to $800, until he accumulated about 80 bitcoins. The wine executive had always wanted an Audi A8L, and in 2016 he saw a slightly used model advertised for $50,000. Since bitcoin had fallen to around $600, that was almost exactly how much bitcoin he had. He sold all his coins to finance the car.\n\nThe owner, however, refused to make any concession on price, which scotched the deal. So, what to do with the $50,000? He decided to put it back into bitcoin, even though the price had risen to $900 by then. At that price, he ended up with just 60 bitcoins \u2014 but that\u2019s now worth more than $450,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more than $120,000 short because I wanted that stupid car,\u201d the wine executive says. \u201cBut by not buying that car, I made almost half a million in profit.\u201d\n\n[Editor's note: This story originally identified the wine executive. We removed identifying information in April 2023 after he received threats and demands to turn over his bitcoin to a criminal enterprise.]\n\nOthers have invested in cryptocurrencies far more aggressively \u2014 with some paying a steep price. When the Mt. Gox digital exchange collapsed in 2014, more than 24,000 customers lost essentially all their holdings. Some customers had dozens or hundreds of bitcoin stored at Mt. Gox, with losses approaching $1 million or more at today\u2019s value.\n\nMore than half of the respondents to our survey think bitcoin is currently overvalued. Source: Yahoo Finance survey conducted via SurveyMonkey\n\nIn our Yahoo Finance survey, 71% of bitcoin buyers said they\u2019ve made money on their investment. But 8% said they had lost money. The median amount of the loss was $500, but some listed five- and six-digit losses. Of those who have made money on bitcoin, the median gain was $3,000, with a few reporting seven-figure hauls.\n\nThe obvious question now is whether the value of bitcoin will continue going up, or whether a speculative bubble is about to burst.\n\nCounting on bitcoin\n\nMany early buyers think bitcoin is only getting started, and at some point will become a mainstream currency used routinely. \u201cIt\u2019s like the early 1990s, when people were asking, \u2018where is this internet thing going to go?\u2019\u201d says a New York bitcoin investor who asked we identify him by his nickname, Duke. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early lunatic adopter phase, slowly shifting to the early adopter phase.\u201d\n\nDuke, who teaches technology at a high school, first tried to buy bitcoin in 2011, but a snafu with a PayPal transaction prevented the transaction. The 30-year-old figured he\u2019d get to it later, but the price jumped to more than $1,000 per coin and he assumed he missed the boat. The price came back down, however, and he eventually bought 21 bitcoins, at prices as low as $200.\n\nAt one point, he spent an entire paycheck buying bitcoin.\n\nNow, with a portfolio worth nearly $160,000, he\u2019s reluctant to cash out even a tiny fraction of coin, for fear of missing out on even bigger gains in the future. \u201cA lot of bitcoin holders are kind of afraid to spend it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could end up spending the equivalent of $2 million on a couple of pizzas. Twenty or thirty years from now, if I have grandkids, maybe I\u2019ll be able to pay for their colleges.\u201d\n\nBy then, maybe schools will even accept tuition payments in bitcoin.\n\nRead more:\n\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.
