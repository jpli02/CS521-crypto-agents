        "content": "Global payment giant PayPal holds a significant part of its financial liabilities in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) offered to its customers.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, PayPal held a total of $604 million in various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), according to the annual report filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 10.\n\nBitcoin has the largest share in PayPal\u2019s crypto assets, accounting for $291 million in the firm\u2019s asset breakdown, while $250 million is held in ETH. The remaining $63 million includes Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash combined.\n\nThe amount of PayPal\u2019s crypto holdings accounts for 67% of the company\u2019s total financial liabilities, amounting to $902 million as of Dec. 31. PayPal\u2019s total financial assets stood at more than $25 billion, according to the filing.\n\nDespite introducing cryptocurrencies onto its platform more than two years ago, PayPal did not include a similar breakdown of crypto holdings in its previous annual financial report.\n\n\u201cDue to the unique risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including technological, legal, and regulatory risks, we recognize a crypto asset safeguarding liability to reflect our obligation to safeguard the crypto assets held for the benefit of our customers,\u201d PayPal wrote in the recent filing.\n\nRelated: PayPal Xoom adds cross-border remittance on debit card deposit\n\nPayPal stores customers\u2019 cryptocurrencies through a third-party custodian, the company noted in the filing. PayPal stressed that it contractually requires the custodian to segregate customer assets and not mix them with proprietary or other assets, adding:\n\n\u201cWe cannot be certain that these contractual obligations, even if duly observed by the custodian, will be effective in preventing such assets from being treated as part of the custodian\u2019s estate under bankruptcy or other insolvency law.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, PayPal debuted its hold-and-sell service for Bitcoin in the United States in November 2020. The company has been doing its best to bring all possible blockchain and crypto integrations to its services, including central bank digital currencies, according to vice president Richard Nash."

A P2P service means that the two parties interact directly with each other on their own terms without the need for third-party involvement.\n\nAlthough LocalBitcoins is remarkably efficient and easy-to-use, other platforms exist. The following platforms provide a similar service that will allow you to interact directly with buyers or sellers to get a good price for your sats (or other digital assets.)\n\nBinance\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange has a P2P section where users can buy or sell a number of cryptocurrencies\u2014including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Binance Coin. Just like LocalBitcoins, the prices of the assets are labeled lowest to highest and users can interact directly with sellers from over 40 countries.\n\nThe service is very easy to use and quick\u2014just like when spot trading on the platform, and the service offers more payment methods than LocalBitcoins (though it lacks some of what LocalBitcoins offers, such as PayPal.)\n\nPaxful\n\nPaxful is one of the most popular P2P Bitcoin exchanges. The platform offers over 350 ways to buy and sell Bitcoin, and offers users a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe exchange also allows buyers and sellers to choose the location they want to shop in, the amount they want to spend, and if they want to make a transaction using another cryptocurrency (LocalBitcoins does not allow users to use cryptocurrency to buy Bitcoin.)\n\nStory continues\n\nUsers can buy Bitcoin using a number of digital assets on Paxful's P2P platform.\n\nPaxful\u2019s platform currently offers Bitcoin and stablecoins Tether and USD Coin and sign-uping up to the website is quick and easy.\n\nHuobi\n\nLike Binance, Singapore-based Huobi is another giant cryptocurrency exchange which also offers a P2P service. And just like LocalBitcoins, it\u2019s not complicated for even beginners to use.\n\nThe platform lists an impressive number of payment methods\u2014including, surprisingly, some banks which have said they don\u2019t allow customers to buy or sell crypto. But note that a trader using the P2P service must use the same details which match their Huobi account details.\n\nBisq\n\nBisq is a private, open-source P2P platform that allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin\u2014and only Bitcoin\u2014using fiat currency without know your customer (KYC) procedures. That means you don\u2019t have to hand over personally identifiable information, such as your name and address, before making a trade.\n\nYou have to download Bisq's desktop app to get started.\n\nFor those wanting complete decentralization, this is the platform: Most cryptocurrency trading platforms now require documentation to sign up, especially if fiat money is involved.\n\nDeposits are held in multisig wallets\u2014meaning the wallet is secured by various private keys, not just one\u2014to protect buyers and sellers. User data is not stored anywhere but traders have to download the desktop app to use it.\n\nOKX\n\nSeychelles-based crypto exchange OKX also has a P2P service where users can buy and sell Bitcoin, Tether, Ethereum, USD Coin, and some other digital assets in their local currency.\n\nLike other services on this list, OKX offers lots of payment methods and users are able to search through the long-list of currencies to find the best offers.\n\nBut users can only use fiat currency to make or receive payments\u2014not crypto."

This week, we\u2019re asking whether crypto donations really make a difference in times of crisis.\n\nAfter the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria at the start of this week, the crypto industry has tried to do its part by rounding up millions in donated tokens.\n\nBlockchain records show wallet addresses shared by AHBAP, a local non-profit, have received more than $3mn in donations this week. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis estimates that more than $5mn in crypto donations have been sent to Turkey and Syria.\n\n\u201cMany people around the world want to help with cryptocurrency,\u201d AHBAP founder and local artist Haluk Levent wrote on Twitter.\n\nChainalysis rival Elliptic has also been crunching donation numbers, finding more than $10mn worth of crypto tokens pledged by a host of crypto firms, most notably Binance which has promised a total of $5mn in donated funds.\n\nIn many ways, Turkey\u2019s economic strife even before the earthquake means the country is tailor-made to embrace crypto. An era of soaring prices and falling interest rates plays into the hands of crypto evangelists who claim digital assets such as bitcoin are a store of wealth and a hedge against inflation.\n\n\u201cIf you ask people, they are so eager on crypto,\u201d one Ankara local named Tolga told me. The FT\u2019s new Turkey correspondent \u2014 and my old boss \u2014 Adam Samson spotted a coin store in his first week in Ankara.\n\nA coin store in Ankara, spotted by the FT\u2019s Turkey correspondent Adam Samson \u00a9 FT montage / Adam Samson\n\nFor an industry scarred by scandal, it\u2019s a great sales pitch to paint crypto as the go-to tool for financial relief in times of crisis. But is it true?\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t use crypto in daily life,\u201d Tolga explained, adding that locals need to convert their crypto to the Turkish lira and withdraw newly converted fiat to their bank account. Hardly the type of financial gymnastics needed in the aftermath of a natural disaster.\n\nAnother local \u2014 who I\u2019ll refrain from naming but who traded cryptocurrencies before the earthquake \u2014 has struggled since the disaster to release funds from a popular exchange. \u201cI am really sad, I have nothing left to do but wait for [the exchange to help],\u201d they told me via Twitter.\n\n\u201cSome of our friends are under the rubble . . . we can\u2019t hold back our tears.\u201d\n\nThe intent on behalf of crypto\u2019s advocates may be admirable, but the simple fact is where crypto succeeds in enabling near-real-time transactions, it fails in real-world utility.\n\n\u201cIf the goal is to get grandma money quickly and simply, there is a strong economic argument that a countertrade swap through a crypto asset isn\u2019t going to be any cheaper than traditional mechanisms,\u201d software engineer and crypto critic Stephen Diehl told me via text. \u201cUltimately, the recipient doesn\u2019t have much use for bitcoin because they can\u2019t spend it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say crypto can\u2019t serve a humanitarian purpose. I\u2019d be remiss not to point out that more than $50mn worth of crypto tokens were donated to Ukraine\u2019s war effort in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion last year.\n\nWeeks after the invasion, Ukraine\u2019s deputy minister for digital transformation Alex Bornyakov said crypto was \u201cextremely helpful\u201d when it came to sending vital supplies to armed forces. \u201cEach and every helmet and vest bought via crypto donations is currently saving Ukrainian lives,\u201d he said.\n\nThat may be true, but before Christmas Bornyakov also told me that Russian use of crypto to evade sanctions was set to become a \u201chuge issue\u201d. So there are always two sides to the coin in crypto land.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on crypto\u2019s utility in times of crisis? Let me know at scott.chipolina@ft.com\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nAnother week, another crypto platform bites the dust. LocalBitcoins, one of the world\u2019s oldest crypto exchanges, announced it will discontinue its service after 10-plus years of activity. The company blamed the \u201congoing very cold crypto-winter\u201d for its closure and apologised to users for \u201cany inconvenience this may cause\u201d.\n\nThe bad news for crypto exchanges continues: late on Thursday Kraken ended its staking programme for US customers and paid $30mn in a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement is the latest in a number of enforcement actions targeting actors the SEC says violated securities rules. Check out my story with Stefania Palma here.\n\nMy colleague Joshua Oliver published a fascinating FT Magazine piece on the final hours of FTX, written during his recent trip to New York. Check it out here.\n\nFormer Coinbase employee Ishan Wahi pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. You may recall the 32-year-old\u2019s case from July last year, when the former product manager was charged with sharing tips on tokens due to be listed on Coinbase. \u201cWahi is the first insider to admit guilt in an insider trading case involving the cryptocurrency markets,\u201d said US attorney Damian Williams.\n\nDays before cracking down on Kraken, the SEC laid out its priority for the year ahead. Among other areas, the regulator pointed to emerging technologies and crypto assets as one sector that may pose risks to investors or financial markets. That much is obvious to anyone who has followed crypto for more than a day, but if you thought the SEC was tough on this industry in 2022, my advice would be to buckle up.\n\nSoundbite of the week: \u2018Shameless\u2019 crypto founder\n\nThree Arrows Capital co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies oversaw one of the highest-profile crypto collapses of 2022 not named FTX.\n\nEarlier this year both men announced a new exchange, named GTX. The idea behind GTX is to offer impatient folks the chance to trade bankruptcy claims before the slow wheels of justice settle claims for themselves. No, I\u2019m not kidding.\n\nThree Arrows\u2019 liquidators, who have long complained about the co-founders\u2019 lack of willingness to engage in the bankruptcy process, slammed Davies for his newest project.\n\n\u201cSince January 5, 2023, Mr Davies has been active on social media, having \u2018tweeted\u2019 or \u2018retweeted\u2019 dozens of times . . . Shamelessly, while ducking his obligations to his failed company, Mr Davies has been recently active in an effort to raise tens of millions to start a new crypto exchange.\u201d\n\nData mining: A word on darknet market share\n\nIf you follow the ever-evolving nexus of cryptocurrency and crime, you will recognise Hydra Market \u2014 at its height the largest darknet market in the world.\n\nEarlier this year the US Department of Justice took action against the founder of Bitzlato, a little-known crypto exchange that allegedly acted as a conduit for laundered money. Its largest trading counterparty, Hydra Market, was shut down in April last year.\n\nFresh data shared by Chainalysis shows that despite having only a third of the year to play with, Hydra crushed the competition.\n\nCryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.
