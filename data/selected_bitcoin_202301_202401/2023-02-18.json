        "content": "According to independent developer Udi Wertheimer, Bitcoin (BTC) non fungible tokens (NFTs) will positively impact the ecosystem by improving its security and incentivizing developers to build on the network.\n\nThe number of newly created Ordinals has been spiking in recent weeks, causing a surge in transaction fees and average block size on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAccording to Wertheimer, Bitcoin NFTs are going to be beneficial for Bitcoin\u2019s security budget. By driving up transaction fees, the creation of Ordinals will incentivize miners to secure the network while the revenue from mining rewards will decrease with each Bitcoin halving.\n\n\u201cBecause the block space is scarce and because there\u2019s demand for stuff like inscriptions, there\u2019s a lot of hope that we will get enough people who want to pay fees in order to keep the Bitcoin network secure,\u201d Wertheimer explained in a recent interview with Cointelegraph.\n\nAlso, Wertheimer noted, Ordinals provide a new use case to make building on Bitcoin commercially profitable.\n\n\u201cWith all of that interest around Ordinals and inscriptions, I expect that there is going to be a very big ecosystem that is built around that,\u201d he said.\n\nWertheimer dismisses the notion held by some Bitcoin core developers that creating NFTs is not an appropriate use case for Bitcoin. According to him, in recent years, Bitcoin core developers \u201chave ignored what actual Bitcoin users want.\u201c\n\nTo learn more about Ordinals and how they impact the Bitcoin network, watch the full interview on our YouTube channel and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!"

        "title": "The economics of cryptocurrency mining: Costs, revenues and market trends - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Mining refers to the process of verifying and adding new transactions to a blockchain network, such as in the case of Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies. The economics of mining refers to the economic incentives and costs associated with the mining process, as well as its impact on the broader economy.\n\nThe economics of crypto mining are driven by a variety of factors, including cryptocurrency prices, mining difficulty, hardware costs, energy expenses, block rewards and transaction fees. This article will explain economics of mining, including costs, revenues and market trends.\n\nCryptocurrency mining costs\n\nThe costs associated with cryptocurrency mining can be broken down into several categories:\n\nHardware costs: The price of specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), for example, can have a big impact on the profitability of mining.\n\nEnergy expenses: Since mining uses a substantial quantity of electricity to run the computing equipment, energy consumption is one of the highest costs involved. Therefore, the profitability of mining can be significantly impacted by the cost of power in a particular area.\n\nCooling costs: The heat produced by mining equipment needs to be dispersed to keep the machinery in good condition. Costs associated with cooling can be high, particularly in hotter areas or in large-scale mining operations.\n\nMaintenance and repair costs: For mining equipment to operate at its best, constant maintenance and repairs are necessary, and these expenses can mount over time.\n\nTransaction fees: Miners may receive transaction fees in addition to block rewards for processing network transactions. The profitability of mining may be impacted by the level of transaction fees, which may change depending on network activity and other elements.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners as energy buyers, explained\n\nCryptocurrency mining revenues\n\nThe amount of cryptocurrency that a miner is able to produce over a specific time period is often used to determine how much mining revenue a miner generates. The revenue is determined by multiplying the value of the mined cryptocurrency by its current market price.\n\nConsider a scenario in which a miner employs mining equipment that can produce 1 BTC every 10 days. The miner\u2019s profit for each block produced would be as follows if the market price of BTC is $50,000:\n\nHowever, the amount of revenue made from mining cryptocurrencies fluctuates based on a number of variables, such as the price at which the cryptocurrency is currently trading on the market, the difficulty of the mining process, the price of power and the effectiveness of the mining equipment being utilized.\n\nFor example, in the early days of Bitcoin mining, it was possible to generate significant revenue with relatively simple hardware. The revenue per unit of computer power did, however, decline as mining complexity and the number of miners rose.\n\nRelated: How to build a cryptocurrency mining rig\n\nCryptocurrency mining market trends\n\nIn recent years, the cryptocurrency mining market has experienced significant growth and has become an increasingly important part of the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem. Some key trends in the crypto mining market include:"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is leaving traders guessing as the bull market's future depends on the last week of February.\n\nIn multiple tweets on Feb. 17, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital flagged crucial resistance battles ongoing on BTC/USD across multiple timeframes.\n\nBitcoin price squares off with bear market downtrend\n\nBitcoin hit new six-month highs this week as the latest innings of its 2023 recovery kept the bull-bear debate raging.\n\nAfter a consolidatory start to the month, February has become a reckoning point for Bitcoin price strength. Gains have been harder to cement than in January, when BTC/USD finished up nearly 40%.\n\nFor Rekt Capital, now is the time to pay attention \u2014 whether trading daily, weekly or even monthly timeframes.\n\nThe weekly chart perhaps represents the biggest struggle in the wake of the 2022 bear market. Bitcoin is currently attempting to beat out an area of resistance it failed to conquer last August, so far without success.\n\n\u201cUltimately, a Weekly Close above this key area is what BTC needs to achieve to break this confluent area of resistance to continue moving higher,\u201d Rekt Capital wrote in part of an update on the weekly chart.\n\nThe picture is complicated thanks to two other major resistance trend lines lying overhead, coming in the form of the 50-week and 200-week moving averages (MAs).\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, these have formed their first-ever \u201cdeath cross\u201d \u2014 a potential nail in the coffin for those hoping that a new bull market is beginning.\n\nOn monthly time frames, an equally tense situation is developing. Here, too, BTC/USD is \u201cgetting very close to breaking the Macro Downtrend,\u201d Rekt Capital says.\n\nThe upcoming monthly close will be the deciding factor, as continued strength could see Bitcoin begin March outside a falling trend line in place since the November 2021 all-time highs.\n\nWhile this would be a significant event, certain signs already suggest that it could become a reality. Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), formerly at all-time lows, \u201chas confirmed a new Bull Trend already.\u201d\n\nBTC price analysis: Whales targeting \u201cbull market maxis\u201d\n\nCloser to home, intraday activity remains tantalizingly opaque as Bitcoin bulls cling to a portion of the week\u2019s upside.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin metric prints \u2018mother of all BTC bullish signals\u2019 for 4th time ever\n\nTwo trips above $25,000 have nonetheless failed to result in a resistance-support flip, and at the time of writing, BTC/USD traded at around $24,500, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour candle chart (Bitstamp).

        "title": "The impact of Ordinals on Bitcoin mempools & transaction size - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The introduction of the Ordinals Protocol, which enables the development of Bitcoin-based NFTs, has coincided with significant changes to mempool activity and transaction size, new data by CryptoSlate and Glassnode show.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nThe ability to mint non-fungible tokens directly onto Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain with all associated content, such as images and videos, is made possible by Ordinal NFTs, also known as digital artifacts or inscriptions.\n\nLaunched in January 2023, the Ordinals protocol allows users to interact with and exchange individual satoshis that may contain unique inscribed data. This new approach to creating NFTs on Bitcoin takes advantage of changes included in the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade. It involves placing the complete content of the NFT directly on-chain, providing a novel way to explore, transfer, and receive such tokens.\n\nWhen combined with the SEC\u2019s decision to exempt Bitcoin from the \u201csecurity\u201d classification, some experts say a bullish outlook for Bitcoin begins to emerge, which could positively impact the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nQuantitative analysis\n\nAccording to recent Glassnode data sourced in conjunction with CryptoSlate, the aftermath of Ordinals has positively impacted Bitcoin. However, the data suggests there are factors to consider in relation to the \u2018health\u2019 of the Bitcoin network. For example, the mean size of transactions increased by over 100%, from 600 B (bytes) to 1100 B.\n\nHowever, the below chart illustrates that Ordinal transactions have low satoshi fees (purple color dominant).\n\nThe total fees (USD Value) of transactions waiting in the mempool in different size (vByte) cohorts have increased since FTX collapsed, and inscriptions have lifted the baseline fee from 1 \u2013 4 satoshis. The congestion within the mempools was raised partly due to an increase in space needed to store Ordinals inscriptions compared to standard transaction data. In addition, a surge in Bitcoin usage during the FTX saga, as investors led an exodus in exchange-held crypto, played a role in the November spike.\n\nGlassnode data shows that Bitcoin\u2019s mean block size upper range has increased significantly since the launch of Ordinals, rising from 1.5-2.0 MB to 3.0-3.5 MB within a few weeks. The increase correlates with not only images but larger files such as audio and video starting to be stored as Ordinals.\n\nNotably, on Feb. 1, Inscription 652, the first piece in the Taproot Wizards collection, set a new record as the largest block and transaction in the history of Bitcoin, reaching 4 MB in size. Additionally, on Feb. 17., CryptoSlate reported on a fart that had been uploaded to the Ordinal network, inscription 2042.\n\nQualitative analysis\n\nGlassnode shows that while the Ordinal network has had a significant impact on Bitcoin transaction hash size and cost, qualitatively, this may be connected to a broader crackdown on proof-of-stake mechanisms.\n\nThe majority of other layer-1 crypto protocols, which refer to base-layer blockchains having their own native tokens, are built on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, including Ethereum.\n\nHowever, with the SEC\u2019s crackdown on Kraken\u2019s staking service in the United States, which suggests that only highly sophisticated retail investors can partake in validating networks of such blockchains, it appears that investing in ETH and similar tokens could become the exclusive domain of institutional players, leading to improvements to the Ordinal network.\n\nAs a result, the Ordinals Protocol is being hailed as a game-changer for the Bitcoin blockchain. By enabling the creation of Bitcoin-based NFTs, it has given the world\u2019s most famous cryptocurrency a new purpose beyond just facilitating peer-to-peer transactions. This is particularly significant, given that the mainstream appeal of Bitcoin has arguably been hindered by factors like banking system regulations and its volatile price swings.\n\nAs evidenced by data from Glassnode, intense bullish activity appears to be forming around the Ordinal network.\n\nFeatured Data Partner\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Although it's possible to buy cryptos like Bitcoin with a credit card, you should think very carefully before you do.\n\nWhile a credit card might seem like a convenient payment option, there are some serious downsides you need to consider, including excess fees and the risk of your payment being blocked. And, it can be tricky to find a crypto trading platform that accepts credit card payments.\n\nThis is not an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade or use any services.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin with credit card\n\nIf you've decided to buy Bitcoin with credit card from an exchange, there are a few steps you will need to follow.\n\nChoose a platform that accepts credit cards First you will need to find a platform that actually accepts credit card payments. There are a small number of platforms including crypto exchanges, investment apps and brokers that may let you pay by card. Create an account Regardless of which service you use to buy Bitcoin with a credit card, you will need to create an account. At a minimum, this requires you to sign up with an email and password. Additionally, most exchanges will require you to pass a Know Your Customer (KYC) process which involves photo ID. Make your purchase The next step is to actually purchase Bitcoin with your credit card. This requires you to provide your full credit card details. Depending on the service provider, they will also ask for billing details such as the associated address, along with the name on the card. Once the details of the credit card have been entered, then you can choose the amount of Bitcoin you would like to purchase. Remember \u2013 you can purchase less than 1 whole BTC. Store your crypto Trading platforms typically offer an in-built wallet to hold your Bitcoin on your behalf. If you don't plan on trading frequently, it's a good idea to consider transferring most of your funds to a personal crypto wallet for added security.\n\nPurchasing Bitcoin with a credit card might seem convenient but it carries a lot more risk than using funds in your bank account. Using a credit card means you are taking on debt which is going to compound rapidly if you don't pay it off immediately. Taking on debt to invest in anything \u2013 especially a volatile asset like Bitcoin \u2013 is particularly ill-advised because you could wind up losing more than your initial investment.

Currency exchange fee If you're using a local credit card on an overseas exchange, you might wind up paying foreign currency conversion fees. Higher interest rates Credit card providers often charge fees upwards of 10% p.a on credit loans.
