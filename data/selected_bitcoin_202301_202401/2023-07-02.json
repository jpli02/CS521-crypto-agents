The token surged 27.98% in the past seven days.\n\nLitecoin, which was created in 2011 as a hard fork to Bitcoin, was one of the four tokens selected to trade on the EDX Markets exchange, which is backed by Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments. The other tokens are Bitcoin, Ether and Bitcoin Cash. The New Jersey-based EDX opened for business despite the crackdown on crypto from U.S. regulators.\n\nThe California-based crypto exchange Kraken was ordered by a U.S. judge on Friday to submit information about its users to the Internal Revenue Service in an investigation of underreported tax liabilities. The crypto exchange was fined US$30 million in February by the SEC for its staking services, which the federal agency said were an offering of unregistered securities.\n\nOther crypto movers included Tron, which dipped 1.85% to US$0.07572, but gained 3.31% for the week. Binance\u2019s BNB token edged down 0.31% to US$247.13, and Cardano\u2019s ADA fell 0.13% to US$0.2905.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap edged up 0.02% to US$1.2 trillion, with trading volume dropping 7.54% to US$27.26 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFTs \u201cbrutal weekend\u201d\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

Another Ethereum-based collection, The Captainz, came in at second place with US$2.3 million.\n\nOver the weekend, the Memeland team behind The Captainz NFTs, revealed their PFPs or Profile Picture art upgrades for the collection but met with mixed to negative response. \u201cMost negative responses to the art came from people who were unaware that the art would be upgradeable with purchasable traits,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cWithout these traits the base characters are nearly identical, which caused some confusion in the NFT community.\u201d\n\nU.S. equity futures little changed\n\nU.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were little changed as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down 0.029%, S&P 500 futures dipped 0.011%, while Nasdaq Futures added 0.068%.\n\nU.S. equities rallied during regular trading on Friday, the last day of the first half of 2023, though face disruptions to trading this week with limited trading hours on Monday and the July 4 public holiday on Tuesday when equity markets will be closed.\n\nEconomic indicators to come this week include US manufacturing activity on Monday as well as a monthly jobs report on Friday. Tesla Inc.\u2019s Sunday announcement of record-breaking vehicle sales in the second quarter is a bullish factor for investors.\n\nJapan equities on Monday gained on the coattails of the Friday rally on Wall Street, with technology stocks leading the gains in Tokyo.\n\nIn China manufacturing slowed, but by less than expected. Both purchasing managers\u2019 Indices in Taiwan and South Korea also showed manufacturing contraction.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is traveling to China in an effort to try and improve communications and the frosty ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nInvestors are expecting more interest rate hikes this year in the U.S. following reiterated warnings from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in speeches last week in Europe that inflation has yet to be brought under control.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on July 26 and predicts only a 12.6% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "content": "It seems like bitcoin has a good setup for the new quarter, with major institutions signaling confidence in both the future of crypto and even in its U.S. regulators at the end of the month . Don't get too carried away though \u2013 crypto is still part of the broader market, which remains in a challenging macro environment. The third quarter is historically the weakest for bitcoin. The average third-quarter gain going back to 2014 is just 4.67%, according to CoinGecko, and it's posted a positive third quarter for only four of the nine in its lifetime. Before the recent rush of applications to launch U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs injected new optimism in the crypto market, it was a frustrating second quarter for traders. Between the end of the banking crisis in May and the BlackRock bitcoin ETF filing on June 15, regulatory pressure weighed heavily on sentiment and bitcoin traded sideways. That lull could come back in the next three months as industry drivers wrestle with macro drivers. \"It's clear that [the Fed] is not fully comfortable yet with the direction of headline inflation numbers,\" Christopher Ferraro, president and chief investment officer of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC. \"So while they pause rate hikes, they're in no way yet committing to a permanent pause or even a rate decline.\" Read more in CNBC Pro's Quarterly Investment Guide The options for weight loss treatment are about to explode.

Here's how investors can catch the next opportunity The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its June meeting, but said two more could be coming later this year. Some on Wall Street are anticipating the Fed will move in July and September. Powell has said the FOMC hasn't decided if a new hike is likely to take place in July. \"You see every day disparate and sometimes orthogonal data points coming out around is the economy growing? Is it shrinking?

It could take a while, however. \"From a timing perspective, I think it's largely unknown\" when a decision on an ETF could come, Ferraro said. \"But \u2026 all these institutions have real concerted efforts and likely would not have put the effort in motion now if there wasn't a strong belief that the market and the regulators, in particular the SEC, were ready to allow regulated products.\" \"Given all of the regulatory uncertainty and the court cases that are going on \u2026 it's actually an opportune time for the regulators to allow regulated products into the market and help clear out some of the concern or lack of clarity,\" he added. The rest of the world While that uncertainty continues in the U.S., other parts of the world are taking a friendlier stance toward the industry. U.K. regulators have developed a \"Regulatory Sandbox\" to allow crypto companies to test new innovations, continental Europe has an established exchange-traded products market for crypto, and Hong Kong has been clear and vocal about its desire to become a crypto hub for the world. \"There's still a disparity in the treatment of crypto in the U.S. and the rest of the world,\" Han said. \"The question is will the U.S. follow suit or continue with its litigious approach?\" There's a growing number of U.S. companies that are no longer willing to wait for regulatory clarity as the price of bitcoin ticks higher, he added \u2013 and many are expecting a big price surge in the spring they won't want to miss. BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin is up more than 80% YTD \"Some are looking to move their headquarters, or at the least establish large offices, in crypto friendly jurisdictions,\" Han added. \"One U.S. crypto company we know is now even seriously contemplating its public listing in London or Hong Kong and we're also seeing more U.S. crypto companies looking to create offshore offerings\" like Ripple and Coinbase . While Ferraro and others remain upbeat about the future of crypto and unworried that regulators will eventually find an appropriate path forward for American crypto businesses, it could end up being too little too late. \"I am optimistic we will get it right,\" Ferraro said. \"I am fearful that the U.S. will take its time and while that happens, sticky capital and sticky intellectual capital gets formed elsewhere in the world, and then it's hard to undo.\"\n\nRepresentations of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are seen in this illustration, August 10, 2022.

Don't get too carried away though \u2013 crypto is still part of the broader market, which remains in a challenging macro environment. The third quarter is historically the weakest for bitcoin.
