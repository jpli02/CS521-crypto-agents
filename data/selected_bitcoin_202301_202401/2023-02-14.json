The force then shared its findings with the FCA.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to be able to work in partnership with the FCA in what we believe is a national first here in West Yorkshire,\u201d Brants said.\n\nThe FCA said it was working with \u201cmultiple law enforcement partners\u201d, including other local police forces as it continues to investigate other sites that may be hosting illegal crypto ATMs.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to identify and disrupt unregistered crypto businesses operating in the UK,\u201d Mark Steward, the FCA\u2019s director in charge of enforcement and market oversight, said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Echo that sentiment and the proof of stake allows concentration of larger funds just buying up simply the coin and having an influence on the networks, grassroots work is truly democratized.

I'd love to double down on that with you, Jamie, because you would just kind of mention this idea where you had mined theorem as well. You know, what's the path forward? It was interesting to see a theory and prices really rebound. Even with that looming threat of greater regulatory oversight or crackdown, if you will. So what's the road ahead for assets outside of Bitcoin? I think it's really it's really difficult to say, and certainly clarity is something that the industry desperately needs in order for it to chart a more solid path forward. And you know, Michael, on that note as well to, you know, what does it do now that the book, both of your companies are put together in an industry that was so sorely bruised after last year, you are seeing this kind of price increase this year? What is that price increase in Bitcoin itself mean for the merger of both of your companies? We have a ton of synergies. We always held cuts the highest regard and with Jamie at the helm.

What's your approach, Mike, to the energy usage debate? I know Jamie has long been a champion of greener mining at Hot 8. How do you approach this problem? Absolutely, it is shown within the sites that we operate out in New York.

Yeah, I think we were expecting to see consolidation in this space. It was a little bit late to come, but we have seen some really interesting deals in mining in the last few months.

        "title": "Coinkite's New Bitcoin Hardware Wallet Looks Like BlackBerry, Takes AAA Batteries - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nCanadian crypto hardware manufacturer Coinkite has designed a bitcoin hardware wallet reminiscent of an old-school BlackBerry phone straight out of the 2000s.\n\nBut the company says its new design reflects forward thinking on the tightest possible security measures and user-friendly features gleaned from customer feedback.\n\nThe soon-to-be-released device, dubbed Coldcard Q1, became available for pre-ordering on Feb. 9 and comes with a full keyboard, an LCD screen and an LED-illuminated QR code scanner.\n\nThe waffle-phone-style QWERTY keyboard gives off strong 2002 BlackBerry vibes and is supposed to cut down on so-called fat-finger errors when entering sensitive passwords, PINs and passphrases.\n\nRead more: Wasabi Wallet Will Pay You to 'Crack' a Bitcoin Wallet\n\nCoinkite added a battery compartment on the Q1\u2019s rear side that fits three AAA batteries, so there\u2019s no need for a tethered power supply, although a USB-C port is available for customers who prefer using a power cord.\n\nIt\u2019s the company\u2019s fifth iteration of a bitcoin hardware wallet, following the introduction of the MK line starting in 2018. The most-recent model, the Coldcard MK4, was released in February 2022.\n\nThe company aims to crack into the market-leadership ranks of hardware wallet makers, currently dominated by big names including Trezor and Ledger. But the overall market may be growing as more crypto investors seek out hardware wallets as an alternative to simply leaving coins on exchanges.\n\nOutsiders may scoff at the Q1\u2019s bulky, throwback user interface or UX, but Coinkite says it intentionally came up with that anachronistic design after consultations with users of its smaller, slimmer MK4.\n\nWay more ppl than I expected like the bulky-QWERTY-non-pocketable mountain-man-devices like we do. \ud83d\ude06 \u2014 NVK \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf1e @nvk@nvk.org (@nvk) February 11, 2023\n\nThe exact size, weight and price of the Q1 will be confirmed in the near future, but eager users can already reserve the device with a $199 deposit. The retail price is not expected to be much higher than the deposit amount.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe Q1 was built mainly to help less advanced users,\u201d Celia Cherif, a Coinkite business development representative, told CoinDesk in an interview. \u201cWe gathered their feedback from the MK4 and made everything more UX friendly for them in the Q1.\u201d\n\nGrowing market for hardware wallets\n\nCoinkite\u2019s roots in the Bitcoin space go all the way back to 2011, when co-founders Rodolfo\n\nNovak and Peter Gray stumbled across the Bitcoin white paper and later built a rudimentary bitcoin hardware wallet. The pair eventually incorporated as Coinkite, and the firm now produces and sells a suite of hardware and software Bitcoin products, including the MK4, which Cherif says is Coinkite\u2019s best-selling product.\n\n\u201cColdcard sales have been higher than expected,\u201d Novak wrote in a tweet. Coinkite declined to provide CoinDesk with official sales data.\n\nLast year\u2019s implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX crypto exchange triggered an exodus of customers from centralized exchanges to self-custody devices.\n\nOne crypto publication reported that two of the largest players in the hardware wallet space \u2013 Trezor and Ledger \u2013 captured a significant share of those spooked customers in November. According to the publication, Trezor reported a 300% increase in week-over-week sales while Ledger saw a six-fold increase in account creations for Ledger Live, the firm\u2019s wallet management software.\n\nCoinkite also saw an uptick in sales, although it\u2019s not clear by how much. \u201cBitcoiners are so resolute on bitcoin and so many are getting off exchanges,\u201d Novak tweeted. \u201cIn all my years, I've never seen so much activity.\u201d\n\nConvenience and 'air-gapping'\n\nThe Q1\u2019s design revolves around convenience and security, especially \u201cair-gapping,\u201d which means isolating the device from potentially unsecured networks like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.\n\nCherif says that some less-tech-savvy customers reported difficulties using the MK4. Many customers were fumbling to enter sensitive passphrases, struggling to scan bitcoin address QR codes, dealing with the hassle of connecting power cords and switching back and forth between microSD cards.\n\nWith that backdrop, Coinkite designed the Q1 to include two microSD slots for saving wallet seed phrases \u2013 a series of 12 to 24 random words used to \u201crecover\u201d or regain private keys in the case of accidental loss. The double microSD slots offer more secure data transfer than traditional USB-A connections (more commonly referred to as simply \u201cUSB\u201d), which Cherif says are vulnerable to all sorts of sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of vulnerabilities with USB data connectivity,\u201d Cherif explained. \u201cThere's a website created just to monitor all the known vulnerabilities. The list is never-ending. These are vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited by malicious actors.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s engineers included both AAA batteries and the USB-C port as power sources for the Q1. Cherif also emphasized that the Q1\u2019s USB-C port is strictly reserved for power transmission and not data transfer.\n\n\u201cIf you choose to plug the USB-C cable into an Internet-connected device, it remains a much safer option than a USB cable because it doesn't have any data lines connected, only power,\u201d Cherif said.\n\nCoinkite added a flashlight to the Q1 so users can easily scan Bitcoin QR codes (encoded Bitcoin addresses) in dim lighting.\n\nThe wallet has an LED QR code scanner instead of a video camera-based version. Coinkite says the choice was deliberate because cameras, being more technologically complex, are more prone to malicious hacks.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, the camera is an attack vector,\u201d Cherif explained.\n\nA few Twitter users perusing details of the new device wondered out loud if the Q1\u2019s large color LCD screen is able to display Ordinals, a new type of on-chain Bitcoin non-fungible token (NFT).\n\nOrdinals will look great on that big screen. \u2014 Mike In Space! (@mikeinspace) February 9, 2023\n\nFor now, the answer is \u201cno,\u201d although Coinkite is collaborating with Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on a project that uses a different Coinkite product \u2013 the Satschip \u2013 for Ordinals provenance (using a Bitcoin private key to prove ownership of an Ordinals NFT).\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Community Erupts in Existential Debate Over NFT Project Ordinals"
