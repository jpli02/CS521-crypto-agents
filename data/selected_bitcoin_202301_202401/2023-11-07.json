        "content": "The top 13 public crypto-mining companies sold the equivalent of all the Bitcoin they minted in October, plus a little more, while the digital asset posted one of its biggest rallies since token prices crashed last year.\n\nThe liquidation-to-production ratio was about 105% for companies including Marathon Digital Holdings and Core Scientific Inc., according to data compiled by industry trade publication TheMinerMag, meaning they sold Bitcoin from their holdings in addition to what was produced. That is significantly higher than the previous three months, when the ratio was 64%, 77% and 77% in July, August and September respectively. The ratio peaked at 390% last June amid the crypto market crash and surging power costs."

        "content": "A different kind of ATM is setting up shop in your local convenience store.\n\nThese machines look like traditional banking kiosks, but they allow customers to buy bitcoin in cash.\n\nBitcoin ATMs, or BTMs, exploded in popularity between 2020 and mid-2022, at the height of the crypto craze. At their peak, BTMs totaled 34,000 across the U.S., according to Coin ATM Radar.\n\nMore and more people are using bitcoin ATMs to send money at lightning speed. A study from Bitcoin Depot, the company with the largest share of BTMs across the U.S., found that two-thirds of their customers use the machines for remittances and online purchases. But these machines have also gained a reputation as a vehicle for crime. Scammers can send their victims to these kiosks to take advantage of the faster transaction speeds.\n\nWatch the video above to learn more about what's driving the BTM boom, why these machines attract crime, and how prosecutors plan to fight back."

        "content": "Bitcoin Accumulation Increases as Supply Reaches Historic Low, Supporting Price Stability: Report\n\nBitcoin's available supply has reached a new historical low, indicating an accumulation pattern, according to data from Glassnode. The report suggests that Bitcoin's illiquid supply and long-term holders are on the rise, resulting in a tightening supply and increased bullish sentiment.\n\nAccording to Glassnode's data, smaller, long-term holding entities are actively purchasing the available BTC supply, accounting for 92% of newly produced Bitcoin. The accumulating pattern is visible across investor cohorts, with long-term holdings outperforming short-term holders. This limiting of supply is helping Bitcoin keep its price over $34,000, giving strong support above $30,000.\n\nThe growing trust in Bitcoin is not limited to smaller entities; practically all investors have increased their Bitcoin holdings this year. This pattern displays an optimistic market attitude and points to a long-term bullish outlook.\n\nAnother positive indicator is the accumulation of illiquid Bitcoin, which has a limited quantity. Monthly inflows into the illiquid Bitcoin supply continue, with a net gain of 71,000 BTC per month.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Bitcoin wallet and API platform Blink, formerly known as Bitcoin Beach Wallet, has announced a new partnership with Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n, the second-largest distributor of consumer goods in El Salvador, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nThis collaboration between Blink and Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n has paved the way for a pilot program that allows the distributor to accept bitcoin from a select segment of its extensive customer base, which includes over 40,000 merchants. Furthermore, Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n is actively encouraging and supporting these merchants in integrating Bitcoin as a payment option in their retail locations. This move by Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n is a strategic endeavor to promote and foster business-to-business (B2B) Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador.\n\n\"Our distribution operation, until today, has been predominantly managed in cash and this presents a series of logistical, time, and operational difficulties that slow our day-to-day ability to visit more points of sale. Bitcoin solves that,\" said Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n CEO Rodrigo Jacir Garcia-Prieto. \"The vast majority of our customers do not have access to banking services and this is the perfect way to introduce them to their first financial tool. We want to take full advantage of what bitcoin can do for us and our customers by enabling cash management efficiency, reducing operational expenditures, and increasing our ability to expand our reach within Central America while using a secure payment method such as Blink.\"\n\nThe pilot program has already been rolled out to 30 of the target 80 Phase I merchants, with plans to onboard up to 3% of Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n's customers, equivalent to 1,000 merchants, in 2024.\n\n\"Our collaboration with Distribuidora Moraz\u00e1n isn't just about a feature or a program. It's about catalyzing a nation's shift to embrace Bitcoin from the ground up,\" said Noor El Bawab, CEO of Blink.\n\nThis partnership, along with Blink's new 'Buy & Sell Bitcoin' feature, marks a substantial step forward in normalizing Bitcoin transactions in everyday life in El Salvador. These initiatives exemplify a concerted effort to harness Bitcoin's potential for efficient business operations and inclusive economic growth among communities and small businesses.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
