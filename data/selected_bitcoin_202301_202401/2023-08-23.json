        "content": "This month\u2019s crypto retreat may get worse if key charts for Ether , the second-largest token, prove prophetic.\n\nBoth Ether and a gauge of the top 100 coins have shed about 12% so far in August, the most since November last year, as the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates hurts demand for speculative investments."

        "content": "Bitcoin posted its biggest gain in almost six weeks amid increased optimism that central banks will pause interest-rate hikes that had helped to dent the appeal of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe original digital currency rose as much as 3.6% to $26,794 on Wednesday, the biggest one-day jump since July 13. The increase comes on the heels of Bitcoin\u2019s worst week since November and crypto exchange FTX\u2019s collapse."

        "title": "'We've Seen Enough': Battered Bitcoin at $26K Can't Stay Down Much Longer, Pantera's Morehead Says - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) this summer completed its longest-ever period of negative year-over-year returns, wrote Dan Morehead, founder of crypto investment firm Pantera Capital.\n\nIt won't last, he argued.\n\n\"Our view is that we've seen enough,\" Morehead wrote. \"There's just so long markets can be down.\"\n\n#Bitcoin recently experienced the longest period of negative year-over-year returns in its history, lasting 15 months.\n\n\n\nThe longest period prior was just under a year.\n\n\n\nOur view is that we\u2019ve seen enough \u2013 there\u2019s just so long markets can be down.\n\n\n\nMore: https://t.co/REfxkTp9CJ pic.twitter.com/UCEMMcznAM \u2014 Dan Morehead (@dan_pantera) August 23, 2023\n\nAs of June 12, Morehead said, the price of bitcoin had been negative on a year-over-year basis for 15 consecutive months (starting Feb. 8, 2022). Prior to this, the longest period had been less than a year (Nov. 14, 2014, to Oct. 31, 2015), he continued.\n\nIt's notable that bitcoin is, as of Wednesday, up more than 20% year-over-year, even after last week's tumble from the near-$30,000 level.\n\nAs for possible positive catalysts for a market surely in need of one, Morehead notes that July's positive court ruling on the XRP token for Ripple Labs still stands, as do \"endorsements\" from BlackRock, Fidelity and other asset managers in the form of their spot bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAnd don't forget about the upcoming April 2024 halving at which the BTC block reward for mining fresh blocks will be cut in half. Morehead isn't buying the efficient market hypothesis that the halving is so widely known that the its effect has already been reflected in pricing.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"If the demand for bitcoins stays constant and the supply of new bitcoins is cut in half, this will force the price up,\" said Morehead. His models suggest bitcoin bottomed for good late last year, should hit around $35,500 by the April 2024 halving and nearly $150,000 by late 2025.\n\nBitcoin retakes $26,000 level on Wednesday as rates plunge\n\nWeak economic data out of Europe early Wednesday sent previously surging interest rates sharply lower, with 10-year government bond yields in Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. all lower by 12 to 20 basis points.\n\nU.S. stock indexes are higher, led by the Nasdaq Composite's 1.5% advance. The S&P 500 is ahead by 1%.\n\nBitcoin is up 2% to $26,400, roughly inline with the gain for the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI).\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell takes center stage\n\nThe week's main economic event takes place on Friday morning, where U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell will deliver the keynote speech at the Kansas City Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium.\n\nWhile the Jackson Hole speech in the past has occasionally been a forum for important policy announcements, the betting this time around is that Powell delivers a status quo message \u2013 that the Fed remains focused on containing inflation and will be data dependent going forward on decisions about whether to further tighten monetary policy.\n\n\n\n"
