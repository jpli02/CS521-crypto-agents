        "content": "For more than a decade, the pioneers of the cryptocurrency industry envisioned digital coins as an alternate branch of finance, a renegade sector that would operate outside the reach of big banks and government regulators.\n\nBut as digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether became more mainstream, the crypto industry collided with a 1946 Supreme Court decision that created what is known as the Howey Test, a legal analysis that determines when a financial product becomes subject to the same strict rules as stocks and bonds.\n\nIn recent years, regulators have seized on that legal precedent to argue that cryptocurrencies are just another security, like shares of Apple or General Motors. The crypto industry has fought back, leaving it in a legal gray zone with an uncertain future in the United States.\n\nNow the long-running dispute is edging closer to a resolution, as federal judges begin weighing in on a series of lawsuits by the nation\u2019s top securities regulator against some of the largest crypto firms. This month, judges held hearings in two of the most consequential cases, which could dictate whether the multitrillion-dollar crypto industry can continue growing in the United States."

        "content": "A German programmer who is accused of running an illegal movie streaming site more than a decade ago transferred $2.17 billion worth of Bitcoin to the authorities to repay at least some of the money he had made illegally, the police said on Tuesday. The transfer required the man to use his unique Bitcoin credentials to hand over the funds.\n\n\u201cThis is the most extensive seizure of Bitcoins by law enforcement in the Federal Republic of Germany to date,\u201d said Kay Anders, a spokesman for the Saxony state police. The money will remain in the authorities\u2019 Bitcoin account until a court can figure out what to do with it, Mr. Anders added.\n\nThe man, identified only as a 40-year-old German citizen, and his business partner are under investigation on allegations that they ran what was once the country\u2019s most successful illegal video-sharing site.\n\nIn its heyday, from 2008 to 2013, the site, movie2k.to, had tens of thousands of movies in a host of languages available for download. Users from around the world visited the site, making it among the 25 most-visited websites in Germany, according to news reports at the time. After the authorities shut it down in 2013, several sites with similar names opened to fill the void."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police seized more than \u00a31.4bn worth of bitcoin derived from a huge investment fraud in China, a London court heard on Tuesday, one of the largest seizures of the cryptocurrency by law enforcement globally.\n\nThe disclosure came during the trial of Jian Wen, 42, who is accused of laundering bitcoin on behalf of her former employer, an alleged fugitive from the Beijing authorities. Wen has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn 2018 the UK police seized four separate devices containing more than 61,000 bitcoin from a safety deposit box and a property where Wen and her then-employer, Yadi Zhang, lived at the time, Southwark Crown Court heard.\n\nThe value of the bitcoin by the time all of the cryptocurrency had been recovered by the police, in July 2021, added up to about \u00a31.4bn.\n\nThe prosecution told the jury at the start of the trial on Monday that the bitcoin derived from an investment fraud Zhang had committed in China between 2014 and 2017.\n\nZhang, whose real name is Zhimin Qian, stole roughly \u00a35bn from more than 128,000 investors. She then converted the money into bitcoin and arrived, under a false identity, in London in 2017, the court heard.\n\nShe has since fled the UK and remains at large, according to prosecutors.\n\nWen is not accused of any involvement in that fraud. However, she has been accused of helping to convert some of Zhang\u2019s bitcoin into cash, jewellery and other luxury items, as well as property, while allegedly knowing it was the proceeds of crime.\n\nGillian Jones KC, counsel for the Crown Prosecution Service, told the jury on Tuesday that Wen had tried to purchase a \u00a312.5mn London property on behalf of Zhang in 2018 using the law firm Mishcon de Reya. The purchase had failed because the law firm could not verify the source of the bitcoin, the jury heard. In October that year, the Met froze money held by Mishcon in its client account.\n\nWen had moved to the UK in 2007 from China and became a British citizen in 2018. She has described herself as Zhang\u2019s \u201ccarer\u201d and said she believed all of Zhang\u2019s bitcoin had derived from legitimate business activities, Jones told the jury.\n\nBut Jones said on Monday that Wen was a \u201cfront person\u201d who was paid to \u201ckeep Ms Zhang in the background\u201d.\n\n\u201cMs Wen had been trusted not only with copies of the passwords and passphrases to access the laptops [containing the bitcoin] but with access to where the laptops were being stored,\u201d Jones said.\n\nBefore meeting Zhang in 2017, Wen had worked in Chinese takeaway restaurants, the court heard.\n\nThe trial continues."
