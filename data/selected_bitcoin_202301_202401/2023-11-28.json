        "content": "Bitcoin climbed back above $38,000 on Tuesday amid optimism the US central bank may be closer to lowering borrowing costs if inflation continues to decline.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market value gained as much as 3.3% to $38,264 before trimming the increase. Bitcoin reached an 18-month high of $38,422 on Friday. Lower rates generally increase investors\u2019 appetite for riskier assets such as digital tokens."

        "content": "Standard Chartered: Bitcoin On Track To Hit $100K By End of Next Year\n\nStandard Chartered Bank has restated its previous projection that Bitcoin (BTC) will achieve a value of $100,000 by the end of 2024. Geoff Kendrick and the team at the bank conveyed their confidence that the approval of various spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States will serve as the next driving force behind the cryptocurrency's expansion, with these events expected to happen earlier than initially foreseen.\n\nThe bank anticipates that multiple spot ETFs for both BTC and ETH will likely be granted approval in the first quarter of 2024, thereby paving the way for heightened institutional investment. Furthermore, Standard Chartered emphasized the forthcoming Bitcoin \"halving,\" an event that restricts the currency's supply and is predicted to occur in late April 2024, as an additional factor that could contribute to potential price increases.\n\nStandard Chartered originally predicted BTC will hit $120,000 by end of next year, attributing Bitcoin's triumph to its status as a reputable safe haven asset. The bank maintains BTC's dominance, stating: \u201cBTC\u2019s dominance remains intact \u2013 its share of overall digital assets market cap has increased to 50% from 45% in April.\"\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "00:00\n\nAnd what you will find is it is broadly an update for digital assets really rallying across the board. Bitcoin, one of the ones leading the charge here, up 3.3%. We are now north of $38,000. This is the highest level we have seen for Bitcoin going back to May of 2022. So it's been about a year and a half ether, Of course, taking part in this rally, though it has been lagging behind the recent rally we have seen in Bitcoin in Bitcoin to a large degree, it's up by about 2.9% on the day in that action. And really across the digital asset space, you're seeing tokens moving higher is feeding back into crypto related equities, one of them being Marathon digital. It's higher by about seven and a half percent on the day. And Coinbase generally one I know you're paying a lot of attention to, it's up by about 6% at this point in the session. Coinbase has really been lighting up the internet as well. A lot of people talking about it on the platform now known as X. And remember, it has not only been up every day since we've seen struggles that big multibillion dollar settlement over at big rival Binance, it's actually been on quite a tear, Kelly, since it's hit its October lows again, Of course, some of that some of that is helped by that love in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But really, it's almost an 80% rise since it retested its lows in October. And if you pull out the chart even more, you would see that it's nearly quadrupled since its December lows that it hit last year. It's too soon to see just how much those troubles over Binance have meant over at Coinbase, what it's meant in terms of flows and customers moving over. But soon enough, time will tell."

The bounce has ignited broader interest in the crypto space sooner than anticipated.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Going forward, then, we expect digital assets' rising overall market cap to be a bigger driver of BTC price upside than a continued rise in BTC dominance within the space,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of mined bitcoin have dropped to around 80% in the fourth quarter, as miners tend to hold larger quantities of the token as its price rises.\n\nNew supply will also be diminished by next April's bitcoin halving, a recurring event that reduces the amount of tokens awarded for mining. Typically, prices peak 12-18 months after it occurs, Kendrick said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a positive surprise is also emerging from the demand side, given the rising likelihood that bitcoin spot ETFs become approved for US markets, he added.\n\n\"We now expect more price upside to materialize before the halving than we previously did, specifically via the earlier-than-expected introduction of US spot ETFs. This suggests a risk that the USD 100,000 level could be reached before end-2024,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nThat's as the SEC's attempts to block spot ETFs have suffered a number of court losses. The ETFs would bring fresh capital into bitcoin, as they would allow traditional brokerage accounts access to the cryptocurrency.\n\nFalling Treasury yields can further propel bitcoin, given that crypto tends to be a very long-term trade, Kendrick added. The 30-year yield has dropped to 4.60% from last month's high of 5.17%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStandard Chartered's bullishness was recently joined by analysts at Bernstein, who predicted that bitcoin could hit $150,000 by mid-2025 given similar supply reasons."

        "title": "Bitcoin rally: What the charts show - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 40% over the last three months. Investors are waiting to hear if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin ETF, with inflows into the cryptocurrency surging the last five weeks. Yahoo Finance Reporter Jared Blikre joins the Live show to break down the numbers and give insight into whether or not this bitcoin rally can continue into next year.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right. Let's take a look at the crypto market because Bitcoin bulls are ready to charge. Bitcoin looking for direction this morning as investors' anticipation over an eventual US spot Bitcoin ETF, has pushed the cryptocurrency higher in the last three months. The question now, though, is whether this rally has staying power into the new year. Jared Blikre joining us with maybe a closer look at some of those technicals and the momentum that we've seen. Jared, what do you think?\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, I'm looking at inflows into Bitcoin and this chart goes back to the beginning of the year. And we are on the ninth straight week of inflows into Bitcoin, approaching about $300 million. This is the highest week of the year. And just looking, we can see a lot of activity over the last five weeks. Why? Whatever happened five weeks ago? We got a huge breakout in price.\n\nAnd let's go to the Bitcoin chart. And let's do a year to date. And we can plot this, you can see we really got going in about mid-October here. And you can even see that better with the candlesticks. We got that huge break above 30,000 and then 35,000. Huge, huge sticking points. And the reason those were sticking points is because there is a lot of price memory.\n\nLet me change this back to a line chart. And you can see we are now firmly in the bottom area of all this price history that we had in 2021. Lots of things sorted out in there. Suffice to say, it's going to take a lot to get through there.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs it going to happen slowly, quickly? Depends on the catalyst. But the regulatory environment finally seems to be getting a little bit more habitable for crypto players. It looks like Binance is probably going to skate with a $4 billion fine. But the industry itself is going to survive. And they've taken their lumps over the last couple of years. For the industry to bounce back now, I'd say yes, the bad, the worst is definitely in the past. And there's a lot of smooth sailing ahead. But exactly how that plays out, it's hard to see.\n\nI think the spot Bitcoin ETF, that's probably priced in. But you never know. There could be another burst of enthusiasm around that. Anecdotally, I will say the only time I get recognized in the streets of New York is when crypto prices are popping, and I'm not getting recognized. So I know we haven't gotten that level-- gotten to that level in this cycle yet.\n\nSEANA SMITH: It's weird. I didn't know you were so tied to the crypto. I never would have guessed that.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Apparently, I am personally levered to Bitcoin prices. I don't know what's in that, but that's the way it happens. So I started getting recognized, yeah, I'll be really bullish, but we're just in the beginning stages right now, guys.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: All right, Jared Blikre. We will have to put a pin in that one and come back to you. We'll watch out for you for your man on the street Bitcoin quote.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: That's a great idea, Diane. Man on the street, person on the street Bitcoin. We're going to do that.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: Exactly. All right, thank you, Jared."
