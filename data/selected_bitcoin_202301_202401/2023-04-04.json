        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recovered to trade above US$28,000 on Tuesday afternoon in Asia. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also rose, with Dogecoin gaining the most. Asian markets were mixed following weak U.S. factory data and renewed concerns over recession and inflation after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) unexpectedly cut oil production.\n\nSee related article: WonderFi, CoinSmart, Coinsquare to merge into Canada\u2019s largest crypto trading platform\n\nBitcoin rose 0.26% to US$28,029 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. on Tuesday in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly gains to 3.97%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether rose 0.96% to US$1,812 and strengthened 5.09% in the last seven days.\n\nDogecoin gained the most among top 10 cryptos, rising 26.1% in the last 24 hours to US$0.09845, gaining 35.72% on the week. The memecoin\u2019s price surge comes after Elon Musk, the chief executive of social media platform Twitter and a fan of the token, changed Twitter\u2019s blue bird icon to a Japanese Shiba Inu, the same dog species featured on Dogecoin.\n\nXRP dropped the most on the day, by 3.07% to US$0.4979, but strengthened 2.85% on the week.

The Shanghai Composite rose 0.49% and the Shenzhen Component Index dropped 0.25%.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index slid 1.05% on the day to 4,014 points, making for a weekly gain of 0.17%. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast Labs data branch, CryptoSlam.\n\nEuropean equity markets opened higher on Tuesday, as the benchmark STOXX 600 rose nearly 0.35% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 gained 0.57% by 11 a.m. local time, after data revealed that Eurozone producer price inflation slowed more than expected in February.\n\nRobert Holzmann, a governing council member of the European Central Bank (ECB), has said that the ECB may increase interest rates by another half-point if the banking sector crisis does not worsen, according to a Bloomberg report."

        "content": "Peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace Paxful has announced that it will shut down, directing users to retrieve their funds from its platform.\n\n\u201cThis will probably come as a shock to many,\u201d Paxful co-founder and CEO Ray Youssef wrote in a blog post. \u201cAll customer funds are accounted for. Please withdraw them and, if you can, self-custody.\u201d\n\nBitcoin peer-to-peer markets are getting getting a lot more pressure. @paxful just suspended its marketplace. pic.twitter.com/UKLkICZcfm \u2014 calle \u26a1\ufe0f (@callebtc) April 4, 2023\n\nThe blog post cited \"key staff departures\" and \"regulatory challenges for the industry,\" but Youssef said during a Twitter space on Tuesday that the decision to close the platform was also influenced by a lawsuit brought by a Paxful co-founder who is suing Paxful and Youssef after being \u201ckicked out of the company\u201d more than a year ago.\n\n\u201cMy co-founder sued the company and sued me,\u201d Youssef said. \u201cI have a lawsuit over my head right now.\u201d\n\nThough he did not name the plaintiff explicitly, Youssef is likely referring to co-founder Artur Schaback, who filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against Youssef in January, according to a court docket hosted on CourtConnect.\n\nSchaback could not be reached for comment by Decrypt.\n\n\u201cPaxful is a nominal defendant in the litigation, so we cannot share much around the case,\u201d a Paxful spokesperson told Decrypt, also declining to identify the plaintiff. \u201cBut I can confirm that Artur Schaback is a co-founder and current board member of Paxful.\u201d\n\nPaxful Vows to Refund Celsius Earn Bankruptcy Victims\n\nThe announcement of Paxful\u2019s closure comes just days after Youssef promised to make Paxful Earn customers whole. The service had allowed Paxful customers to earn a yield on Bitcoin through a partnership with Celsius, a prominent crypto lender that filed for bankruptcy last July.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Paxful spokesperson told Decrypt that, despite the company\u2019s impending closure, Paxful\u2019s wallet is operational, and \u201cusers can get their funds out safely.\u201d\n\nPaxful database is a bit overloaded now as everyone is withdrawing funds. It is making transfers slow. I promise funds r safe and they will clear soon \u2014 Ray Youssef (@raypaxful) April 4, 2023\n\nYoussef claimed that Paxful\u2019s senior staff were largely driven away from the company because of actions taken by the unnamed co-founder\u2019s legal team. Youssef added that the co-founder refused to pay some of Paxful\u2019s employees.\n\n\u201cHis litigation team was really nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey drove away all of our senior-level staff who just couldn't deal with this guy anymore.\u201d\n\nBy this past Friday, it had gotten to the point where there were no engineers, compliance team members, or security personnel left working at the company, Youssef said. Ultimately, he said he decided at that point to shut the company down due to security concerns.\n\nYoussef claimed he subsequently hired an engineering team to assume control of Paxful\u2019s digital wallet\u2014presumably still being used for safekeeping funds. He said it was the right thing to do, even though it conflicted with a court order that he\u2019s received.\n\n\u201cI've managed over the weekend to get an engineering team to secure everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to make an ethical decision.\u201d\n\n'Integrity Over Revenue' Says Paxful CEO After Booting Ethereum From Platform\n\nPaxful was originally founded in 2015, and it is the latest firm to succumb in the midst of crypto winter. The company is headquartered in New York and has offices in Estonia, the Philippines, and Russia, according to a press release.\n\nAt one point, the company allowed customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2014the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014along with the leading stablecoin Tether. But the company dropped support for Ethereum last December.\n\nYoussef said that Paxful was ultimately successful in the sense that it fostered Bitcoin adoption in West Africa and other areas of the Global South. According to Coin Dance, trading volume on Paxful totaled around $35 million in the past week, with users based in countries like Argentina, Kenya, and India."

        "title": "Bitcoin Volatility Index's Correlation With Price Flips Positive, Boosts Appeal of Bullish Call Options - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nCrypto options exchange Deribit's forward-looking bitcoin volatility index (DVOL) offers clues about the market's expectations for price turbulence over the next 30 days, just as the Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index, VIX, does for equities.\n\nA key difference has emerged this year. While the VIX continues to serve as Wall Street's fear gauge, rising during bouts of risk aversion, the DVOL has developed a positive correlation with the cryptocurrency's price. The 30-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin's price and the DVOL index flipped positive in early January and rose to a high of 0.85 last week. At press time, the coefficient was 0.72. That has made call options tied to bitcoin (BTC) more attractive than ever, according to observers.\n\n\"Since the start of 2023, bitcoin has displayed a strong spot/implied volatility regime of positive correlation. That has flipped 2022 on its head,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data provider Amberdata, told CoinDesk. \"It's been rewarding call buyers with directional spot gains and increasing volatility gains.\"\n\nDVOL, introduced in early 2021, measures bitcoin's 30-day implied or expected volatility using Deribit's options order book. The VIX is based on the options prices of the S&P 500 stock index.\n\nOptions are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, a signal the holder has a bullish stance, while a put option gives the right to sell. Options prices are determined by several factors, including market direction as well as implied volatility, which is influenced by the supply and demand for options.\n\nDVOL's positive correlation with the cryptocurrency's price means call options stand to benefit from both favorable directional movement and an uptick in implied volatility. In other words, calls are likely to see faster price appreciation during bullish moves than puts during bearish moves.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Assuming the spot/vol correlation persists, this raises the appeal of owning calls as a call buyer can hit a 'double whammy,' winning on both Delta [directional gains] and Vega [implied volatility gains] in a sharply rising market,\" Spencer Hallarn, an over-the-counter trader at crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.\n\nCaught off guard\n\nThe positive correlation is in stark contrast to last year, when bitcoin's turn lower after an 18-month bullish trend caught traders off guard, leading to panic buying of put options. At the time, DVOL spiked during notable price declines and puts saw faster price appreciation during bearish price action than calls during corrective rallies.\n\nCBOE's VIX index rises during bearish market environments and falls or holds steady when the market rallies. That's because stock traders tend to be long-term bullish and are quick to snap up puts for protection on the first signs of weakness in the stock market. Demand for protection dissipates when the market rallies, leading to a decline in the VIX. The net effect is that puts see faster appreciation in value during market swoons than calls do during risk-on trends.\n\nDVOL acted as a fear gauge in 2022, spiking during notable price sell-offs. The situation has changed this year with implied volatility moving in lockstep with the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nBitcoin rallied almost 70% in the first three months of the year, contradicting expectations for a continued market decline. According to OTC tech platform Paradigm, funds have been piling into bullish positions via options.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, could soon kick in, driving stronger demand for options and pushing DVOL higher.\n\n\"The crypto market can sometimes spike up and everybody then wants to be fully in it (FOMO, especially since we came down from the $68K level),\" Pierino Ursone, head of options at Deribit, said while explaining DVOL's positive correlation with the price. \"When extra demand for out-of-the-money higher strike calls kicks in for crypto, one should beware it can be really strong and persevering.\""
