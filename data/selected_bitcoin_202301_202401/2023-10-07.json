        "content": "In a recent development, Bitcoin proponent and crypto advisor to El Salvador\u2019s President Max Keiser has made a future prediction for the Bitcoin price, joining the ranks of analysts who have made bold assertions about the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s trajectory.\n\nKeiser Says Bitcoin Price To $220,000\n\nIn a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Keiser stated that the Bitcoin price will experience an explosive rise to $220,000 in the short term. However, he didn\u2019t specify how soon the crypto token would see such a rally. He made this assertion in response to a CNBC article about the current decline in the financial market amid economic and inflation concerns.\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Keiser once again reiterated that Bitcoin would rise to $220,000 as he claims that \u201cCentral banks will print a wall of money visible from outer space.\u201d His belief seems to stem from the fact that many will be looking to use Bitcoin as a hedge against rising inflation.\n\nHe even alluded to the fact that the US dollar was losing its purchasing power \u201cat a very rapid pace.\u201d He gave an instance of how paying $100 for hamburgers years ago looked like a joke, but he had just spent \u201c$84 for a very ordinary hamburger.\u201d\n\nFor the longest time, Keiser has been bullish on the foremost cryptocurrency. In 2011, he called Bitcoin the \u201ccurrency of the resistance\u201d and the \u201cbiggest story of the decade.\u201d Additionally, he always touted a financial collapse as what would spark a massive rally in the Bitcoin price. Then, he stated that Bitcoin\u2019s adoption and price will increase as banks collapse.\n\nArthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, also shares similar sentiments with Keiser. He recently stated that the government would likely resort to money printing to save the bond market, which could lead to a meteoric rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC bulls struggle to maintain control | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nIs Inflation Good Or Bad For Crypto?\n\nThere seem to be divergent views on how rising inflation could affect Bitcoin and the crypto market by extension. While people like Keiser and Hayes see rising inflation as bullish for Bitcoin, others like Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten believe that inflation could spell more trouble for Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to Merten, the Federal Reserve needs to keep hiking interest rates to bring down the inflation rate as there is excess money in the system due to the \u201cexcess printing of money.\u201d Meanwhile, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone warned that the rising interest rates could cause a further decline in the Bitcoin price.\n\nThere also seems to be a correlation between the stock and crypto markets. As such, it doesn\u2019t seem like Bitcoin and the crypto market exist in isolation, as any financial crisis could significantly impact it.\n\nFeatured image from The Face, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Stocks are in a bubble and could crash by over 50% if it ends badly, Jeremy Grantham says.\n\nThe elite investor sees house prices falling and predicts a recession will strike next year.\n\nHere are his 16 best quotes from a new interview, including comments about bitcoin and AI.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeremy Grantham floated the possibility of a 50% crash in the S&P 500, predicted US house prices would drop, and rang the recession alarm during the latest episode of Bloomberg's \"Merryn Talks Money\" podcast.\n\nThe GMO cofounder and market-bubble historian also slammed bitcoin as a scam, advised against buying US stocks or real estate, and shared his outlook for fossil fuels and artificial intelligence.\n\nHere are Grantham's 16 best quotes, lightly edited for length and clarity:\n\n1. \"The market suffers from attention deficit disorder, so it always thinks every rally is the beginning of the next great bull market.\"\n\n2. \"If everything works out badly, I would not be amazed if the S&P went to 2,000. That would require a couple of wheels to fall off, and wheels tend to fall off in the great bubbles' unraveling, but it doesn't mean they have to. The S&P would be unlikely not to get to something close to 3,000.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"The simple arithmetic suggests you'll either have a dismal return forever, or you'll have a nice bear market and then a normal return. And the nice bear market will be hopefully less than a 50% decline, but it won't be a huge amount less than 50% from the peak in real terms.\"\n\n4. \"You increase the pressure on a very complicated system until a few things snap. That is the pattern \u2014 something breaks and nobody seems to know what it is. It's always a surprise, but you always have a surprise, so the idea of a surprise is totally unsurprising.\"\n\n5. \"My guess is we will have a recession. I don't know whether it will be fairly mild or fairly serious, but it will probably go deep into next year.\"\n\n6. \"The most vulnerable area in my opinion is the Russell 2000. It often has no collective earnings at all. It has a very high density of zombies \u2014 companies that really can only pay their interest payments by issuing more debt. They're vulnerable on the debt front, vulnerable on the financial front, and vulnerable on a broad economic front.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \"An over 40-year period of driving down mortgage rates, of course you drove up house prices all over the world, pretty much. And now the rates have gone up, of course it will drive down.\"\n\n8. \"House prices are worse for the ordinary household. They're worse for the economy than stocks because they're substantially more broadly owned. It's really an important part of the median family's income picture and capital picture. The motto should be, 'Don't mess with housing.' The super motto should be, 'Never have a housing bubble at the same time as you have a stock-market bubble.'\"\n\n9. \"Although we didn't get carried away with ridiculous subprime this time, the multiple of family income actually went higher than it did in 2007. So in terms of actual long-term vulnerability posed by overpricing, this housing market was more overpriced, and it was accompanied by a much more overpriced and classically bubbly stock market than 2007.\"\n\n10. \"Don't invest in real estate, don't invest in the US. If you have to invest in the US, quality has been the mispriced asset for 100 years. They outperform in bear markets. They underperform in bull markets, because you want to own Tesla, you want to own meme stocks, you want to own what's flying. You don't want to own Coca-Cola, it's just too boring.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. \"When it comes to quality, they have less risk of every kind. They have less debt, they go bankrupt less, they have less volatility, they have a lower beta. Yet they outperform. That is a free lunch.\"\n\n12. \"Bitcoin is, of course, an elaborate scam, really.\"\n\n13. \"Commodities break your heart because just as they're doing well, they have a wipeout for 18 months, and then they go roaring back to a new high.\"\n\n14. \"Artificial intelligence is absolutely for real. Is it big enough, soon enough to stop the deflating? No, I don't think it is. It's a 10-, 20-year, multi-decadal effect going off into the distant future, and it will be potentially vast in its effects.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. \"I'm not a great believer in economists. They've lost the plot for the last 70 years. They've forgotten their job description, which is to be useful. They drown in assumptions and closed systems, which are largely irrelevant for everything except their reputation inside their industry.\"\n\n16. \"You should not be surprised if the price of oil doesn't go over $100 maybe once or twice in the next five years. You should be amazed if the price of oil does not then have a long-term crutch, and it will run down to a level where the Saudis or somebody will be able to grind out $45 oil into the setting sun. That's how I think the game will end.\""
