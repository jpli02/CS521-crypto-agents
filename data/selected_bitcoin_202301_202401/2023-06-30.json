A Cboe spokesperson confirmed that it will refile on the behalf of Fidelity. Nasdaq is working to answer questions and give updates for its next iteration of the filing."

        "content": "The price of bitcoin fell Friday following a report that recent bitcoin filings from big names such as BlackRock and Fidelity have been deemed inadequate in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBitcoin finished the day below the flat line at $30,398.43, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it briefly fell under the $30,000 level, after rising as high as $31,260.52.\n\nBitcoin ended the week down 1.5%. Nevertheless, it finished the month up 12.3%, following a down month in May, which was the cryptocurrency's first losing month of the year and worst month since November 2022. June's positive performance brought its year-to-date gains to 83%.\n\nThe move came after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the SEC told Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets, both of which filed bitcoin exchange-traded funds applications on behalf of various institutions this month, that the filings aren't sufficiently clear or comprehensive.\n\nSpecifically, the SEC said it returned the filings because they didn't name the spot bitcoin exchange that the Nasdaq and Cboe would have a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" with or provide enough detail about the arrangement, according to the report.\n\nThe filings can be resubmitted. A Cboe spokesperson told CNBC that the exchange plans to update and refile."
