        "title": "Bitcoin Is Here to Stay, Tim Draper Says - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nLet's talk, first of all, about the reason that you've had to move your target on Bitcoin back, $250,000, you now say, by 2025. What has been holding Bitcoin back you think the most? I wasn't when I predicted it because I was at 4000. So it's gone to 30,000 in that time. And I wasn't really expecting the U.S. bureaucracy to be this aggressive. And I thought that maybe they would be recognizing that they've got to compete with the rest of the world. They've got to provide a platform from which entrepreneurs can can flourish. And by having this regulation, by enforcement that the SCC has been professing and driving, it's really driving all the great entrepreneurs out. And I think that that is that has hurt the Bitcoin price. But but Bitcoin is here to stay. It's a great it's a great system, it's a great currency, it's a great way to operate. I can't wait until I can raise a fund all in Bitcoin, invest it all on Bitcoin. And my my portfolio companies all pay their employees and suppliers all in Bitcoin and have taxes all paid in Bitcoin and have the waterfall all fall into people's bitcoin wallets because then there's no accounting, there's no auditing, there's no bookkeeping. It's all done on the blockchain and it's all honest and it's all straight. And I think that that is going to be that's going to bring society to an anthropological leap forward. It's going to be an amazing time and I can't wait for it. I guess I thought that it was going to happen a little sooner than it did. I also thought retailers would recognize that they can save 2% by accepting Bitcoin, and I thought they'd recognize that sooner. But that hasn't happened yet, and I think it's going to happen about the right time, about the same time as that happening. And maybe we'll get my price target then. Tim, a lot of you know, a lot of the OG Bitcoiners have sort of given up on the transactional piece of it on the currency side of it, looking at it more as a store of wealth like digital gold, why are you still pushing that that use case and how would it work? Would you use the Lightning Network or some other software patch to make it faster and more efficient? Yeah, I think when people talk about using Bitcoin as a store of value and that that being the only use, what they're missing is that the Lightning Network can operate on chain. So all these people who talk about Bitcoin using too much energy or it's too slow or whatever, they're missing that. When you move it off to the Lightning Network and maybe with open Node or whatever, it can do 5000 transactions a second and it doesn't require a lot of energy. And and I think that as the software starts being built for the smart contracts on Bitcoin, when ETFs are more targeted toward Bitcoin, they're calling for calling them ordinal, not ETFs, foreign entities. Yes, there were a lot of credibility and BlackRock guys are going to be doing it, but the nav ts, one CnF, ts or ordinal become a part of Bitcoin. And when when it does start focusing around Bitcoin, I think you're going to start seeing the real flourishing of Bitcoin. And and I think FDX sent us a very strong message that we don't want centralized currencies of any kind and we don't want I mean, we don't want a central bank, we don't want centralized currencies of any kind because they can be controlled by one person and that one person can take us off a cliff."

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, July 11, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ault Alliance, Inc. (NYSE American: AULT), a diversified holding company, (\"Ault Alliance\" or the \"Company\"), announced today that it plans to explore a pathway that will allow it to issue a special dividend payable in Bitcoin to stockholders. The Company intends to collaborate with regulatory authorities, its transfer agent and others, which may include a trusted custodian, to determine what is required in order to pay a special dividend in Bitcoin.\n\nThe planned dividend would be paid from Bitcoin generated by the Company\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, BitNile, Inc. (\"BNI\"). As previously announced, BNI issued an unaudited update on its Bitcoin mining operations reporting BNI\u2019s mining operations is currently operating at an operational hash rate of 2.1 exahashes per second with approximately 9,000 of its Bitcoin miners at its Michigan data center and 10,000 Bitcoin miners that are being hosted through its strategic collaboration with Core Scientific, Inc. The annualized gross value of Bitcoin currently being mined utilizing BNI\u2019s miners is more than $55 million, or approximately 1,800 Bitcoin, based on current market conditions, including a current trading price of Bitcoin at $30,400 and a mining difficulty of 50.65 trillion.\n\nAult Alliance remains dedicated to its core mission of driving innovation and delivering exceptional value to its stockholders. With the increasing popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies, Ault Alliance recognizes the potential of Bitcoin as a valuable asset for its stockholders. The idea of potentially issuing a Bitcoin dividend is aimed at providing a forward-thinking approach to stockholder value enhancement. By leveraging its Bitcoin mining operations, Ault Alliance seeks to provide an alternative investment opportunity and potential long-term value appreciation for its stockholders.\n\nAult Alliance is also exploring ways to facilitate the effectuation of its conceptual design for stockholders who may not be familiar or comfortable with receiving a dividend in Bitcoin itself. Ault Alliance would, with the intention of addressing the preferences of all of its stockholders, accomplish this objective by offering its stockholders as of the ex-dividend date a choice of receiving actual Bitcoin or a cash payment equal to the dollar value of the Bitcoin as of such ex-dividend date.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"By exploring a possible Bitcoin dividend, we aim to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and provide additional value to our stockholders,\" said Milton \"Todd\" Ault III, Founder and Executive Chairman of Ault Alliance. \"We believe that cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, hold tremendous potential for the future, and we want our stockholders to benefit from this exciting opportunity.\"\n\nIn order to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and promote transparency, Ault Alliance will be working closely with relevant regulatory authorities throughout the process. The Company is committed to adhering to the highest standards of corporate governance and regulatory compliance in all its operations. At this time, the Company has not declared a dividend and there can be no assurances that it will declare a dividend payable in Bitcoin or a Bitcoin-denominated cash payment, if at all. The Company has not yet determined what procedures would be required to permit stockholders to receive a dividend in Bitcoin, and even if the Company is able to pay a special dividend in Bitcoin, there are no guarantees that all stockholders will be permitted by their local governmental bodies to receive the dividend in Bitcoin.\n\nAult Alliance notes that all estimates and other projections are subject to the volatility in Bitcoin market price, the fluctuation in the mining difficulty level, the ability to build out and provide the necessary power for miners, and other factors that may impact the results of Bitcoin mining production or operations.\n\nFor more information on Ault Alliance and its subsidiaries, Ault Alliance recommends that stockholders, investors, and any other interested parties read Ault Alliance\u2019s public filings and press releases available under the Investor Relations section at https://www.ault.com/ or available at https://www.sec.gov/.\n\nAbout Ault Alliance, Inc.\n\nAult Alliance, Inc. is a diversified holding company pursuing growth by acquiring undervalued businesses and disruptive technologies with a global impact.

The Mediterranean sun bounces off the bright white stucco walls of the house, illuminating the orange terracotta roof and casting a glow over Taihuttu, who sits on a plastic chair tucked under a round table of the same make. The Dutch patriarch of the Bitcoin Family drinks black coffee and pores over cryptocurrency price charts on his MacBook Pro as he decides which trades will begin his day. \"We just need a few thousand per month to live on so our performance is not really important to us,\" Taihuttu tells CNBC from his deck overlooking an expansive stretch of cobalt-colored water, cliff-backed beaches and bougainvillea.\n\nTaihuttu's family home in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nTaihuttu's self-effacement and modest surroundings belie the 45-year-old's success. In 2017, Taihuttu, along with his wife and three kids, liquidated all their assets, trading a 2,500-square-foot house and most of their earthly possessions for bitcoin and a life on the road. This was back when the price of bitcoin was about $900. Bitcoin is currently trading at over $30,000, down from an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in November 2021. Those extreme price swings have helped grow the Dutch family's crypto nest egg. For seven years, the investor has regularly been swapping his bitcoin for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins to capitalize on the volatility in the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency. When Taihuttu thinks bitcoin is reaching a bull market peak, he trades his bitcoin into stablecoins such as tether, USDC and DAI. When it appears as though bitcoin is touching cycle lows during a bear market, he starts buying it back. So far, Taihuttu says the gamble is working out great thanks to a market indicator he created himself dubbed the Didi BAM BAM.\n\nDidi Taihuttu in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nTaihuttu's indicator considers a mix of inputs, including directional trading data and moon cycles. It has guided all of Taihuttu's investing decisions since he built it before the Covid-19 pandemic. \"From mid-November to the start of December 2022, we saw the first signs the bear market was completely over,\" said Taihuttu. \"It was confirmed in January 2023 when the long flag appeared in the model.\" He added, \"People should have been buying bitcoin already, because every bitcoin you bought at $16k, it's at $30k now, so that's almost 90% upside.\" The father of three says his bitcoin investment is up about 50% since the bottom of the most recent bear market. The Taihuttus declined to share with CNBC the current dollar amount of their crypto investment in aggregate. But Taihuttu did disclose that they had fully bought back into bitcoin by the time the coin surpassed the $19,000 price threshold, so they're \"not doing so bad.\" It also helps that the nomadic family's primary domicile is in Portugal \u2014 Europe's ultimate crypto tax haven. \"You don't pay any capital gains tax or anything else in Portugal on cryptocurrency,\" said Taihuttu. \"As long as you don't earn cryptocurrency for providing services in Portugal, you're in the clear.\" \"That's a very beautiful bitcoin heaven,\" he said.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Didi Taihuttu in Lagos, Portugal. Didi Taihuttu\n\nHow the BAM BAM indicator works\n\nWhen Taihuttu began day trading tokens, he initially turned to traditional predictive metrics such as the stock-to-flow model and the Mayer Multiple \u2014 a measure calculated by dividing the current price of bitcoin by the 200-day moving average to help identify frothy moments in the market when an asset's value eclipses its intrinsic value. But spending the time reading the tea leaves of all these somewhat-related measures didn't seem like a particularly productive use of his time, so Taihuttu decided to create his own proprietary blend of the best indicators on the market. \"It's not just enough to know which indicators go into a formula,\" explained Taihuttu. \"What you can't see is the calculus and the code that implements over the stock conditions. Those calculations display in charts.\" Beginning in 2019, Taihuttu started to incubate and perfect a custom-built predictive trading tool that would weigh multiple technical indicators \u2014 plus a bit of astrology \u2014 and then spit out real-time insights into potential price swings. \"It's a combination of Bollinger Bands, Lower and Upper Bands, NMA, Red/Green Ribbon, NormStoch, RSI, Price Oscillator, Plot, MACD, Cross, Chande Momentum Oscillator, RSI-EMA, Full Moon and New Moon,\" explained Taihuttu, naming a dozen of the most popular market signals that crypto traders watch when they make investment decisions. \"Short and long signals and confirmation signals are shown on the charts when it could be a great moment to buy or sell,\" continued Taihuttu.\n\nThe Taihuttu family in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the technicals that underlie the model: Bollinger Bands focus on price volatility over time.

Didi Taihuttu\n\nThen there are the intangible price influencers such as moon phases. \"I'm not saying it always affects the price of bitcoin, but the moon influences a lot,\" said Taihuttu. Taihuttu has found that when there is a full moon or a half moon, people tend to trade more. \"They tend to buy more, they tend to sell more,\" he said. \"Maybe it's a coincidence, but if you look at the chart, you can see that mostly at the full moon, depending on where we are in the cycle, there's a dump or a pump.\" Taihuttu added that the lunar phases also typically sync with the opening and closing of bitcoin's monthly puts and options. \"So, if we are in the top of the Bollinger Band in combination with a full moon, then you know that we are going to run,\" continued Taihuttu, suggesting a market sell-off is imminent.\n\nLosing his edge to ChatGPT\n\nTaihuttu used to sell the Didi BAM BAM indicator to traders but says he will soon give the trading tool away to selected bitcoin evangelists to help spur adoption. But he also admits his business model is disappearing. \"Anyone in the world can now go into ChatGPT and tell them, 'Write me an indicator based on the moving averages and this cycle or that cycle. And write me a script that I can implement into TradingView and then they can make their own indicators,''\" explained Taihuttu. \"I'm losing business there.\"\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards The \"Bitcoin Family\" in Thailand. Didi Taihuttu\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence is a specific form of AI that is able to produce content from scratch. The systems take inputs from the user and feed them into powerful algorithms fueled by large datasets to generate new text, images and video in a way that can appear almost human-like. AI captured the spotlight following widespread public adoption of OpenAI's GPT language processing technology. ChatGPT, which uses massive language models to create human-sounding responses to questions, has ignited an arms race among some companies over what is seen as the next \"paradigm shift\" in tech. While ChatGPT isn't able to deliver a querent a trading algorithm in Pine Script, which is TradingView's programming language, the technology does challenge the role of investment advisers. In March, Goldman Sachs' chief information officer, Marco Argenti, told CNBC the bank is experimenting with generative AI tools internally to help its developers automatically generate and test code. More recently, in May, Goldman spun off the first startup from the bank's internal incubator \u2013 an AI-powered social media company for corporate use called Louisa. The push into AI is part of a larger effort by CEO David Solomon to expedite the bank's digital makeover. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, is using it to inform its financial advisors on queries they may have. The bank has been testing an OpenAI-powered chatbot with 300 advisors so far, with a view to ultimately aid its roughly 16,000 advisors in making use of Morgan Stanley's repository of research and data, according to Jeff McMillan, head of analytics and data at the firm's wealth management division. Taihuttu uses ChatGPT himself, but more for writing articles about subjects such as bitcoin and the Lightning Network. But he notes that while it is a productivity hack, the output doesn't necessarily rank highly in search results. \"They will still find out that it's ChatGPT,\" he says. \"But it's still saving you a lot of time.\" \u2014 CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report."
