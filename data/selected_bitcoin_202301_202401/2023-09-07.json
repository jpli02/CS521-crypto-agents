        "title": "22-year-old who lost $80,000 in crypto: 'I was investing with money I didn't necessarily have' - CNBC",
        "content": "Ethan Nguonly, a 22-year-old software engineer, started investing in the stock market with the help of his parents before he was a teenager. Today, his investment portfolio includes close to $135,000 in retirement and brokerage accounts, plus two houses. But he didn't get there without making what he now calls his biggest financial mistake. Between November 2021 and June 2022, Nguonly says he lost about $80,000 by investing in crypto on margin. His losses include $30,000 of his original investment and an estimated $50,000 in unrealized gains. Investing with margin involves using borrowed funds to purchase an asset. Nguonly says he had already made pretty hefty crypto investments in bitcoin and ethereum of around $40,000, plus a few hundred dollars in altcoins like shiba inu and dogecoin. But as bitcoin's price went on a tear, he decided to buy more \u2014 about $15,000 worth \u2014 on margin. For a moment, Nguonly says he was up about $50,000 as the price of bitcoin reached its all-time high. But at the end of 2021 the crypto market took a turn, and by the summer of 2022 bitcoin's price crashed over 70%. \"I was investing with some money that I didn't necessarily have,\" Nguonly tells CNBC Make It. \"Once the crypto market kind of reversed, my losses were amplified.\"\n\nBuying on margin: Know the risks\n\nInvesting on margin is a sophisticated strategy that can prove lucrative if your investments continue to perform well. But it amplifies your losses if the market takes a dip. When you buy on margin, you're borrowing money from a broker in order to invest more than you otherwise could have. As a result, you can boost your earnings, but are also at risk of losing more if the market goes the other way, as Nguonly experienced. Bitcoin's price crashed so much he faced a margin call, meaning he had to sell a significant portion of his holdings to cover the cost of the loan. To make a profit when buying on margin, your investments have to outperform the cost of the loan itself, which is part of why your losses will be greater if your investments depreciate. This can happen with any kind of security, but particularly volatile assets like cryptocurrency may make you more vulnerable to losses like Nguonly's. Indeed, investing in cryptocurrency in any capacity has always been risky. Even during the run-up to bitcoin's November 2021 all-time peak, the investments remained speculative, volatile and mostly unregulated. While investing is an important factor in building wealth, it always comes with risk. Especially when it comes to crypto, experts recommend only investing what you can afford to lose. It's also important to avoid investing techniques you don't understand, such as options trading or investing on margin. \"Margin accounts can be very risky and they are not appropriate for everyone,\" the Securities and Exchange Commission warns in its guide for investors. There are rules, like minimum deposits and borrowing limits, from the Federal Reserve and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority aimed at ensuring people who open margin accounts know the risks and understand the financial commitment they're making.\n\n'Only invest money you have'"

        "title": "Bitcoin above US$26,000; JP Morgan working on blockchain payment system - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Friday morning in Asia to trade above the resistance level of US$26,000, leading a rally across most top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. The exceptions were Cardano and Toncoin, which both posted minor losses. Ether logged moderate gains but remained below US$1,650. U.S. financial services giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reportedly exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system, raising optimism for more institutional adoption of blockchain. U.S. stock futures traded mixed, after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Thursday. Stronger-than-expected jobs data has added to U.S. rate hike concerns.\n\nBitcoin spearheads crypto winners\n\nBitcoin rose 1.62% in the last 24 hours to US$26,179.43 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, turning a weekly loss into a gain of 0.75%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency had been trading between around US$25,500 and US$26,000 since Saturday. It reached an eight-day high of US$26,409.30 early Friday morning.\n\nJPMorgan, the largest bank in the U.S. by asset size, is \u201cin the early stage\u201d of developing a blockchain-based digital deposit token for cross-border payments and settlements. The bank has already laid out most of the underlying infrastructure, but will wait for approval from U.S. regulators before making the token itself, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nDeposit tokens are transferable digital assets representing deposit claims against a commercial bank. Token transactions take place on blockchains, making deposits faster and cheaper than traditional methods.\n\n\u201cIt is another sign that large corporations continue to build their blockchain capabilities during this bear market,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to crypto, some traditional players are holding back while others are making strides,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock. PayPal\u2019s announcement that it will launch a stablecoin has started a domino effect of institutional action in crypto, he said.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOnce a large player kicks things off and competitors see that as a desirable/profitable set-up, it won\u2019t be long until other players launch their own solution, if only to stay relevant in an ever-advancing space,\u201d d\u2019Anethan added.\n\nThe market is currently waiting on a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding another U.S. financial giant \u2014 BlackRock. On June 15, the world\u2019s top asset manager applied for approval to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\u201cWhile most expect the SEC Blackrock decision to hit the market in October, the news of a potential ETF approval can also come any time,\u201d Thielen said.\n\n\u201cOnce Bitcoin regains some momentum, the rally could have legs and bring prices back above US$30,000,\u201d he added.\n\nElsewhere, Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), said on Thursday that despite the apparent good health of the U.S. economy, the country\u2019s banking industry \u201ccontinues to face significant downside risks from the effects of inflation, rising market interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty.\u201d\n\nBitcoin prices have historically benefited from uncertainties in the banking system, such as the crisis at Zurich-based lender Credit Suisse in March. The bank\u2019s sudden collapse sent the token\u2019s price from below US$27,000 to over US$28,000 on March 19.\n\nEthereum gained 0.77% to US$1,644.68 over the past 24 hours and edged down 0.07% for the past seven days.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged small gains. Cardano\u2019s ADA and the TON network\u2019s Toncoin were the only tokens that posted losses, dipping 0.14% and 0.70% respectively. But both coins posted gains for the week at 1.07% for ADA and 3.68% for Toncoin.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.37% to US$1.05 trillion. Trading volume dropped 11.95% to US$23.81 billion.\n\nStrong US jobs data; China restricts iPhone use for government employees\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading mixed as of 09:40 a.m. in Asia. The three major U.S. indexes also closed mixed on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite posting a 0.89% loss. All the main Asian indexes were down Thursday morning, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng leading the losses with a 1.34% drop.\n\nInitial jobless claims in the U.S. fell to 216,000 for the week ending Sept. 2, the lowest level since February. That was short of the 234,000 forecast by experts in a Reuters poll.\n\nLast week\u2019s August jobs data pointed to a gradual softening in the U.S. labor market. But Thursday\u2019s jobless report shows \u201cthe labor market is still tight,\u201d Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told Bloomberg. She said the data could influence the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking on interest rates,\n\n\u201cMore moderation in job growth will be needed to keep rate hikes further down the road off the table,\u201d Vanden Houten said.\n\nOn the other side, multiple Federal Reserve officials said on Thursday they thought the U.S. central bank should keep interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Sept. 20. In July, the Fed raised the rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% \u2014 the highest level in the past 22 years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not yet convinced that we\u2019ve extinguished excess inflation. But in today\u2019s complex economic environment, returning inflation to 2 percent will require a carefully calibrated approach\u2014not endless buckets of cold water,\u201d Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said on Thursday.\n\nLogan said that another rate hike pause would be \u201cappropriate\u201d when the Fed meets again later this month.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 95% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, up from 93% on Thursday. It gives a 57.4% chance for another pause in November.\n\nMeanwhile, multiple Chinese government agencies have instructed their staff not to bring iPhones to work amid tensions between Beijing and Washington. The government may also expand restrictions to state-owned enterprises and affiliated organizations.\n\nChina is one of Apple\u2019s largest foreign markets. It accounted for nearly a fifth of the firm\u2019s global revenue in 2022. Apple\u2019s shares closed 2.92% lower on Thursday following the reports.\n\n\u201cThe Nasdaq is sinking as one bad Apple spoils a bunch of mega-cap tech stocks,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst at U.S.-headquartered foreign exchange corporation OANDA, told Fortune on Friday.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s growth story is heavily reliant on China and if the Beijing crackdown intensifies that could pose a big problem to the bunch of other mega-cap tech companies that rely on China,\u201d Moya said.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF: The quiet 800-pound gorilla in the room is about to roar - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A Bitcoin ETF will likely be approved in the U.S. by the end of 2023. The general public has no idea this is about to happen. Even crypto natives, dismayed by depressed markets and a decade of rejections by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are somehow brushing off the current state of affairs.\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds have been highly sought after since 2013 when the first application was submitted to the SEC and subsequently rejected. Over the past 10 years, the SEC has denied each of the several dozen ensuing proposals, including over 30 just since 2021. There are currently 10 active applications from major institutions. An uninformed observer may expect more of the same rejection, but this would be naive.\n\nTwo substantial developments in the past three months have drastically improved the prospects of an approval. Let\u2019s take a look at these developments and consider whether or not a spot ETF could revitalize Bitcoin and lift crypto out of its bear market.\n\nDevelopment 1: BlackRock\u2018s ETF bid\n\nMomentum kicked off on June 15 this year when BlackRock made waves by unexpectedly submitting a Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink has spoken favorably about Bitcoin since then. Bitcoin \u201chas a differentiating value versus other asset classes, but more importantly, because it\u2019s so international it\u2019s going to transcend any one currency,\u201d Fink said. His change of tune is remarkable as he previously denounced Bitcoin as an \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d back in 2017.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s track record of ETF application approvals is nothing short of superb. The asset management giant has submitted 576 applications and all but one have been approved. Have the Bitcoin ETF tea leaves adjusted, and BlackRock taken note? BlackRock\u2019s 99.8% approval rate suggests so.\n\nSeveral other high-profile institutions including Fidelity and Ark Invest have followed suit with pending applications under review. Their filing dates and decision deadlines are largely identical. There are four deadlines during the review process in which the commission may, and often does, opt for delay and further review.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether the SEC decision arrives early or not until final deadlines, the caliber of the institutions currently applying and their optimism are signaling one result: approval.\n\nDevelopment 2: Grayscale\u2018s court win\n\nA separate but equally significant development in the direction of ETF approval is the Aug. 29 federal court ruling that the SEC was wrong to deny Grayscale Investments\u2019 filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale previously applied to convert their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The SEC denied this application, and Grayscale responded with a lawsuit arguing that the decision was incorrect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with Grayscale in its decision stating \u201cIn the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful.\u201d The court also ruled that the SEC\u2019s \u201cdenial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThe court ordered the SEC to once again review Grayscale\u2019s application, effectively reversing the previous rejection.\n\nWhile the ruling does not equate to automatic approval, it strengthens the odds that approval is on the horizon. The SEC would need to provide strong support for further rejection. This begs the question: If such support exists, would it not have been included in their original rejection?\n\nOdds of approval\n\nWhile the SEC recently delayed all ETF applications on Sept. 1, as most applicants\u2019 first deadline for review was on Sept. 2, the delays were largely expected. The market responded accordingly with Bitcoin dropping about 5% from the delay announcement to around US$25,700 at the time of this writing. Despite the delays, the path to a spot ETF approval is much clearer after Grayscale\u2019s win in court. JPMorgan analysts believe this, as well as former SEC Chair Jay Clayton who says approval is \u201cinevitable.\u201d\n\nIt is reasonable to expect the SEC to approve several or even all of the filings at once. The applications are structured very similarly, and it may be considered unfair to grant any of the applicants a head start. Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, told Bloomberg: \u201cI think the SEC, if it\u2019s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once.\u201d Ark Invest has the earliest \u201cfinal deadline\u201d for its filing, which is slated for Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, believes there is a 75% chance of a spot Bitcoin ETF getting SEC approval this year. He ups the odds to 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nScreen Shot 2023 09 07 at 1.22.09 AM\n\nIf SEC approval is inevitable, how might we expect markets to respond?\n\nWhat crypto markets will do, post-ETF\n\nBitcoin ETFs already exist in the European Union, Canada, Brazil and Dubai. But as the U.S. is the center of world financial markets, including crypto markets, approval by its government would undeniably be a major event.\n\nAn ETF would shuttle new money into Bitcoin. While crypto exchanges such as Coinbase are the primary avenue for entering crypto today, the average American understandably has trust issues with them. KYC (know-your-customer) procedures and having to transfer funds to purchase crypto are also onerous as opposed to simply buying an ETF share. Crypto wallets, private keys and self-custody complicate matters further.\n\nThe institutions applying for a Bitcoin ETF deeply understand these hurdles. They know an ETF is an opportunity for a large segment of the population, who have thus far remained sidelined, to comfortably begin adding crypto exposure to their portfolio.\n\nBitcoin spot ETFs, in contrast to futures ETFs \u2014 which have traded in the U.S. since 2021 \u2014 may be particularly constructive to crypto markets. Spot ETFs, the type that all current applicants are applying for, would require the offering institutions to back the ETF with real Bitcoin. This differs from futures ETFs, which merely enable investors to trade an indexed derivative. In the case of futures ETFs, Bitcoin does not actually change hands. A new buyer of a spot ETF has a genuine positive impact on the price of the underlying asset.\n\nAnother way of thinking about a futures-based ETF is like two people betting on how the price of something will change. It\u2019s more akin to a side bet on what will happen. Their bet has no direct effect on the price of the asset they are betting on.\n\nA Bitcoin spot ETF issuer such as BlackRock or Fidelity must buy bona fide Bitcoin to back the shares of the fund that their customers hold. A Bitcoin spot ETF buy or sell will actually change the price of BTC.\n\nThe new source of fund flows into the space may provide the spark the industry needs to recover from a series of blows in 2022. The news itself will almost certainly cause a rush of buying in the short term. The volatility will breathe new life into the markets which have largely been subdued throughout this summer. The Grayscale decision on Aug. 29 produced a near immediate 6% Bitcoin price increase from US$26,100 to US$27,700. This increase fully re-traced on news of the SEC\u2019s choice to delay all of the outstanding applications on Aug. 31 as the first decision deadline for most filings approached.\n\nIf the ETF is approved, it is possible that market gains will extend longer than only in the short term.\n\nIn the short to medium term, a reflexivity loop may be created whereby:\n\nBitcoin price increases on ETF approval news.\n\n\u2b07\n\nInvestors desire Bitcoin allocation due to price increases.\n\n\u2939 \u2934\n\nInvestors purchase shares in a spot ETF, which drives Bitcoin prices up further.\n\nIn the long term, we will see BlackRock et al shepherding clients to diversify part of their portfolio into Bitcoin. Passive investors will buy and hold for the long term. As Bitcoin\u2019s supply is finite, the price is bound to be driven upward.\n\nGold appreciated eight years in a row after the initial spot Gold ETF was approved back in 2004. For all proclamations of Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d it would be fitting for Bitcoin\u2019s next upward cycle to similarly commence following ETF approval.\n\nThe world is not paying attention to Bitcoin at the moment. That will change before the year ends."

It\u2019s more akin to a side bet on what will happen. Their bet has no direct effect on the price of the asset they are betting on.\n\nA Bitcoin spot ETF issuer such as BlackRock or Fidelity must buy bona fide Bitcoin to back the shares of the fund that their customers hold. A Bitcoin spot ETF buy or sell will actually change the price of BTC.\n\nThe new source of fund flows into the space may provide the spark the industry needs to recover from a series of blows in 2022. The news itself will almost certainly cause a rush of buying in the short term. The volatility will breathe new life into the markets which have largely been subdued throughout this summer. The Grayscale decision on Aug. 29 produced a near immediate 6% Bitcoin price increase from US$26,100 to US$27,700. This increase fully re-traced on news of the SEC\u2019s choice to delay all of the outstanding applications on Aug. 31 as the first decision deadline for most filings approached.\n\nIf the ETF is approved, it is possible that market gains will extend longer than only in the short term.\n\nIn the short to medium term, a reflexivity loop may be created whereby:\n\nBitcoin price increases on ETF approval news.\n\n\u2b07\n\nInvestors desire Bitcoin allocation due to price increases.\n\n\u2939 \u2934\n\nInvestors purchase shares in a spot ETF, which drives Bitcoin prices up further.\n\nIn the long term, we will see BlackRock et al shepherding clients to diversify part of their portfolio into Bitcoin. Passive investors will buy and hold for the long term. As Bitcoin\u2019s supply is finite, the price is bound to be driven upward.\n\nGold appreciated eight years in a row after the initial spot Gold ETF was approved back in 2004. For all proclamations of Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d it would be fitting for Bitcoin\u2019s next upward cycle to similarly commence following ETF approval.\n\nThe world is not paying attention to Bitcoin at the moment. That will change before the year ends."
