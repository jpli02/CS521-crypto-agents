        "content": "Nearly a dozen new investments funds that hold Bitcoin began trading last week, making it easier for anyone with a basic brokerage account to buy a slice of the digital currency.\n\nSeveral established financial institutions, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have coalesced around Bitcoin because it is the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut Bitcoin remains an enigma to most everyday investors, and it\u2019s hard to separate the buzz from any true potential. It\u2019s also wildly volatile.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a bet. And institutions are wagering that plenty of investors want in.\n\nBut putting crypto into a traditional investment wrapper does not paper over the underlying risks. Here\u2019s a look at how it works:\n\nWhat is an exchange-traded fund?\n\nExchange-traded funds are similar to mutual funds, but they can be traded on an exchange like a stock. E.T.F.s track the performance of the assets they hold, which might include a diversified basket of securities like stock or bonds, or even single commodities, like gold, silver and crypto."

        "title": "Bitcoin Spot ETFs Nearing $4B in AUM After 6 Days Since Launching - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin Spot ETFs Nearing $4B in AUM After 6 Days Since Launching\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively acquired 95,000 BTC in just six trading days, surpassing outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, Fidelity's (FBTC) and BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) lead inflows, with over $1.2 billion each. IBIT has a slight edge in assets under management, with $1.4 billion compared to FBTC's $1.3 billion.\n\nInvesco's ETF had its best day for inflows on Friday, January 19, attracting over $63 million. VanEck's ETF also had a strong Friday, pushing its total assets under management beyond $100 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC saw $590 million in outflows on Friday, putting the total outflows from GBTC to be $2.8 billion since it was converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF. However, total net flows is a positive $1.2 billion, as other spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $4 billion in funds, likely due to the lower fees compared to GBTC.\n\nOn their fifth trading day last Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs netted a combined $440 million in Bitcoin from investors. BlackRock's IBIT led with 8,700 BTC, valued at nearly $358 million. Nine ETFs, excluding Grayscale, have acquired almost 68,500 BTC, valued at around $2.8 billion, since their inception. Meanwhile, the rest of the spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a 34% increase in daily trading volume by the fifth day of trading.\n\nThe successful approval and launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs was a highly anticipated milestone, showing growing institutional interest and demand for regulated Bitcoin investment products. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 2.53% over the past week and is currently trading at $41,250.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Blockchain hit the market in 2009 with the launch of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. In the context of bitcoin, the technology is an immutable and tamper-proof public ledger of transactions. Businesses have been looking to put these principles to use in other applications for blockchain, which is sometimes referred to as distributed ledger technology.\n\nOne of the concerns about the AI models \u2014 the kind that underpin applications like ChatGPT \u2014 is that the data they are trained on could contain biases or misinformation. That means the answers an AI system may give would contain those biases and false information.\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Blockchain could be used to prevent bias in the data that artificial intelligence models are being trained on \u2014 and that could be a \"killer use case\" for the technology, executives told CNBC.\n\nIn the case of AI, training data can be put on the blockchain. That will allow the developers of the AI system to keep track of the data that the model has been trained on.\n\nCasper Labs, a business-focused blockchain firm, partnered with IBM this month to create such a system.\n\n\"The product that we are developing, the datasets are actually checkpointed and stored on the blockchain so you have a proof of how the AI is trained,\" Medha Parlikar, chief technology officer and co-founder of Casper Labs, told CNBC during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week.\n\n\"And so as you use the AI, if it's learning and you find that the AI is starting to hallucinate, you can actually roll back the AI. And so you can undo some of the learning and go back to a previous version of the AI.\"\n\nHallucinations broadly refer to when an AI system gives out false information.\n\nBlockchain is a technology that has been spoken about for many years, and a host of industries ranging from finance to health care have been looking at ways to use it.\n\nSheila Warren, the CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, said, however, that a blockchain-based AI training data ledger could be the \"killer use case\" for the technology.\n\n\"I actually do think that the verification of an AI and sort of the checks and balances ... within an AI system, are going to be blockchain driven and blockchain backed,\" Warren told CNBC during the panel."

        "title": "1 Top Bitcoin ETF to Buy Before the Crypto Market Soars 300%, According to a Wall Street Analyst - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently worth $1.6 trillion, and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) accounts for 50% of that total. Bitcoin dominance (i.e., the market value attributable to Bitcoin) was also 50% five years ago, though it has ranged from 38% to 70% during that time period.\n\nWith that in mind, Morningstar analyst Michael Miller expects the cryptocurrency market to soar 300% to $6.4 trillion by 2032. If Bitcoin dominance stays at 50%, the implied upside for Bitcoin would also be 300%. Alternatively, the implied upside would be closer to 200% if Bitcoin dominance slipped to 38%, and the implied upside would be closer 460% if Bitcoin dominance increased to 70%.\n\nRegardless, cryptocurrency bulls have good reason to invest in Bitcoin, and that can be done in a few ways. The most obvious method is a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN). But creating and managing an account may be a headache, especially for investors with existing brokerage accounts.\n\nFortunately, a new type of investment product eliminates that friction: spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs reduce friction for investors\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, funds that track the price of Bitcoin. That landmark decision could draw more retail and institutional investors to the market, and the influx of capital could drive the price of Bitcoin much higher in the years ahead.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are particularly attractive because they eliminate the headache of managing multiple accounts. Investors no longer need to buy Bitcoin through a specialized exchange, nor do they have to worry about storing the cryptocurrency with a blockchain wallet. Instead, spot Bitcoin ETFs make it possible to add Bitcoin exposure to existing brokerage accounts. That convenience is why spot Bitcoin ETFs could drive the price of the cryptocurrency higher.\n\nFor context, analysts at Bernstein believe the price per Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by 2025, implying 252% upside from its current price of $42,600. Similarly, analysts at Standard Chartered Bank believe the price per Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025, implying 369% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe best (and worst) spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nGenerally speaking, all spot Bitcoin ETFs do the same thing. They purchase Bitcoin from a cryptocurrency exchange (often Coinbase), divide the Bitcoin into shares, and sell those shares on the stock market. In other words, this is not a situation where a team of experienced asset managers could create substantial value for fund holders by trading the right securities at the right times.\n\nFor that reason, buy-and-hold investors should focus on fees or expense ratios. As mentioned, the SEC has approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, but fees vary widely between certain funds, as detailed below:\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: BITB): 0.20%\n\nArk 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKB): 0.21%\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (NYSEMKT: FBTC): 0.25%\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT): 0.25%\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (NASDAQ: BRRR): 0.25%\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: HODL): 0.25%\n\nFranklin Templeton Digital Trust (NYSEMKT: EZBC): 0.29%\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: BTCW): 0.3%\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BATS-CHIXE: BTCO): 0.39%\n\nHashdex Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: DEFI): 0.94%\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: GBTC): 1.5%\n\nPersonally, I would eliminate the bottom half of that list based on fees alone, and none more so than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. There is simply no reason to pay 1.5% for an ETF -- that means investors would pay $15 annually on every $1,000 invested -- when an identical product could be purchased for a fraction of that cost.\n\nNext, I would consider the issuer behind the ETF. Several funds listed above are run by asset managers with plenty of experience, including Ark Invest and Fidelity. But the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be my top choice, because the fund is run by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world.\n\nTo be clear, the issuer should matter very little, but ETFs run by larger asset managers may be less prone to liquidity problems arising from insufficient demand. For instance, the iShares Bitcoin Trust finished Jan. 18 at a 0.08% premium to its net asset value. That means investors are valuing the ETF at a 0.08% premium to the price of Bitcoin. That points to strong demand. Conversely, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust traded at a 0.27% discount to its net asset value, which hints at weaker demand.\n\nHere's the bottom line: I would avoid spot Bitcoin ETFs with an expense ratio above 0.25%, and I would absolutely avoid the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, simply because there are less expensive alternatives. Building on that, I would feel comfortable buying the spot Bitcoin ETFs run by Ark, BlackRock, and Fidelity, but the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be my first choice.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.
