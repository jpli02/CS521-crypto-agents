        "title": "Happy birthday to a 'giant Ponzi scheme', from bitcoin's accidental co-creator - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIt\u2019s 14 years exactly since the launch of bitcoin and one big mystery remains unanswered: why is the front page headline of a UK newspaper from Saturday, January 3, 2009, baked into the code of the first bitcoin block?\n\nJanuary 3 has become Independence Day among those who fear centralisation, with the genesis block their digital Liberty Bell. Hiding a bank bailout reference in bitcoin\u2019s foundation stone was more than a timestamp or lorem ipsum, they reason; it was Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s way of telling the world that crypto meant freedom. No more reckless government intervention in monetary policy, no more debasement of fiat to save private enterprises, etc.\n\nThis is not a view shared by Francis Elliott, former political editor of The Times, who wrote the story. Crypto is \u201cnothing more than a giant Ponzi scheme\u201d and \u201can absolute scam\u201d, he told FT Alphaville.\n\n\u201cI first heard about my connection [to bitcoin] maybe six, seven maybe eight years ago* when people started tagging me on Twitter. They all thought it was really cute that I\u2019d only just found out,\u201d he said, emphasising the back half of the sentence by adopting a Californian accent.\n\nElliott said he has never bought crypto. Nor has he considered turning his accidental fame into a career as a crypto influencer. He also, when prompted, denied being Satoshi.\n\nNevertheless, coinbros would often find him online and offer him \u201cbits of bitcoins\u201d that he deposited in a wallet created specifically for the purpose. These unprompted donations amounted to \u00a31500 at the market peak, which was around when he cashed out after gifting \u201cabout \u00a310 each\u201d in tokens to his sons.\n\nElliott offers no explanation as to why his slightly speculative story about UK bad bank proposals became embedded in crypto\u2019s alpha block.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those stories I was relieved was right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an OK source but . . . well, it was a Christmas New-Year story. I\u2019ve no idea why [Nakamoto] used that piece or who he is. Perhaps he knew something we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBecause of its place in crypto history, copies of The Times from January 3, 2009, have held their value better than most cryptocurrencies. Back-issue websites and online auction houses show zero availability. The \u201cGenesis Block Newspaper\u201d market quotes asking prices of up to $1.3mn and claims \u201conly eight verified copies\u201d exist, which might ring false for anyone who has ever visited a UK library.\n\nHas Elliott kept a souvenir copy?\n\n\u201cI did get the front page framed, but I lost it,\u201d he said.\n\n* A Twitter search pins the exact date of discovery to December 18, 2013."

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining: A Positive or Negative Indicator for the Future of Crypto? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "In a recent piece titled \u201cCrypto will be fine,\u201d former CoinDesker Brady Dale noted that even though crypto has taken a beating throughout the year that was, there are some indicators that remain bullish. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate (how much computational power is directed towards securing the network) remains steadfast.\n\n\u201cIf the industry were dying, these miners should be winding down. They aren't,\u201d Dale wrote. Indeed, according to Blockchain.com data, Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate is just a ways off its all-time high set in November, 2022.\n\nThis article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hashrate rose steadily over the past 12 months even as the network\u2019s token, bitcoin, lost over two-thirds of its value. For many, this is a sign of faith in the long term success of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency network.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s more to the story than a single statistic. As Compass Mining\u2019s Zack Voell (another ex-CoinDesker) detailed in a Monday report, the bitcoin mining industry took a series of beatings in 2022.\n\nIn his catalog of \u201call of the bad things that miners suffered,\u201d Voell found that at least four executives of major mining firms resigned over the year, six lawsuits have been filed against mining companies \u2013 for reasons stretching from breach of contract to zoning rule violations \u2013 and stocks for publicly-traded mining companies are in the doldrums.\n\nAdditionally, two mining companies, Core Scientific and Compute North, filed for bankruptcy while Celsius and BlockFi, two bankrupt crypto lending firms with sizable mining wings, are likely going to have to restructure their operations. Another two mining companies, Marathon and Argo, are also at risk of declaring bankruptcy.\n\nRead more: Inside Core Scientific\u2019s Prearranged Bankruptcy\n\nThe situations vary by firm, but the main causes of the issue stem from BTC\u2019s depressed price and, often, poor treasury management. My colleague George Kaloudis simplified the picture by saying that over the last few years many mining companies pursued accelerated growth strategies financed by debt and other investments while often choosing to hold onto their mined coins.\n\n\"Many miners acted too deterministically,\" projecting bitcoin would hit $100,000, Juri Bulovic, head of mining at crypto mining and staking firm Foundry, which is owned by CoinDesk\u2019s parent company, Digital Currency Group, told CoinDesk\u2019s Eliza Gkritsi. The situation worked well when bitcoin\u2019s price was rising and the cost of financing expansion was cheap \u2013 two things thrown off course amid macroeconomic uncertainty and rising interest rates.\n\nAlready, outside firms have been stepping in to backstop losses and inject much-needed capital into the lagging professional mining sector. Galaxy Digital struck a $100 million deal with Argo, Binance has spun up a fund for distressed miners and just today investment giant BlackRock committed $17 million to bankrupt bitcoin miner Core Scientific.\n\nAlthough the mining sector is in a precarious position \u2013 fueled in part by unprecedented deployment of state-of-the-art mining equipment order and deployed during the heady days of 2021, when bitcoin hit a high of $69,000 \u2013 the industry isn\u2019t likely going to be wiped off the map. In addition to battle-tested firms deploying better treasury management, there are also a line of new financing options coming online \u2013 like derivatives options from Two Prime, which could allow miners to hedge their risk over mining bitcoin in a similar way as in other commodities markets like oil.\n\nMore capitulation and bankruptcies could come, and unprofitable miners may be taken offline. But considering the global sprawl of the mining industry, the sectors\u2019 committed activist investors and supporters and the growing importance of mining within the hydrocarbon and wider energy sector mining will remain. And the business might be better for its recent troubles.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "The Genesis Block: The First Bitcoin Block - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The Genesis Block was simply the first block of bitcoin (BTC) to be mined. You might see it called Block 0 or Block 1.\n\nIt\u2019s still there today and will remain there as long as any computer runs the Bitcoin software. Every node in the Bitcoin network can go and look at it, even though it now sits at the other end of a chain hundreds of thousands of blocks long. That\u2019s the point of the blockchain.\n\nA block is a collection of transactions that get validated all together. The transactions in a block get added at once to the chain, which is the complete history of legitimate transactions using bitcoin. Every blockchain has a genesis block, just as every regular chain has a final link. People care especially about the first Bitcoin block because Bitcoin was the first blockchain and remains the largest cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nThe number of transactions in a Bitcoin block is variable, but these days it\u2019s generally between 1,000 and 2,500. On the other hand, the time blocks take to get validated or \u201cmined\u201d is consistently around 10 minutes. This schedule is built into the software: If blocks are mined too quickly, the validation hurdle contrived to keep the network secure and ensure the mining process is competitive automatically gets harder, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the Genesis Block contains the first set of bitcoin transactions to be validated. In fact, there was only one transaction, which was the distribution of the 50 BTC reward for mining the block to a certain address. Miners are still rewarded today, though the reward has since declined to 6.25 BTC. In the case of the Genesis Block, there was only one person who knew about bitcoin to mine it: the original cryptocurrency\u2019s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSatoshi (almost certainly a pseudonym) mined the Genesis Block on Jan. 3, 2009. That was three months after he or she published the Bitcoin white paper in an online cryptography forum. People now call Jan. 3 \u201cGenesis Block Day.\u201d\n\nThe first Bitcoin block\n\nSatoshi made the Genesis Block special in a number of ways. For one thing, the 50 BTC reward was sent to an address from which it can never be recovered. On a technical level, the 50 BTC transaction wasn't recorded as such in the same way as later transactions. That\u2019s why any attempt to spend those coins would fail. Satoshi never commented on the reasons for that.\n\nIn a still more mysterious move, Satoshi wrote a message within the standard lines of data attached to the block. It was a headline from British newspaper The Times:\n\nThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\n\nAgain, Satoshi never explained this. But others have read heavily into the choice. One of Satoshi\u2019s aims in creating Bitcoin might have been to save people from having to hand money over to a bank as an alternative to stashing cash under their mattress. In 2009, the great recession was in full swing. Some people had gone to their bank only to find their money was gone. Other people found their pensions had gone the same way. Many think it is no coincidence that Satoshi chose that particular headline to write into the Genesis Block. This was supposed to be the beginning of the end of people relying on banks so much that the government had to rescue them from their own mistakes using taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nWhether Satoshi\u2019s comment was targeted mainly at banks or governments or both remains a topic of debate among Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nAnother theory is a little more mundane. The inclusion of a headline from that day proved that the code wasn't written before that day. Satoshi might just have wanted to dispel any suggestion he had mined the block in advance to give himself some advantage as its creator.\n\nSatoshi might have had all these things in mind. Barring a spectacular unmasking, we will never know for sure.\n\nIt is also peculiar that the second Bitcoin block was mined on Jan. 9, a whole six days after the first one. Remember, Bitcoin blocks are supposed to take 10 minutes to mine. There could be lots of reasons for the outlier block time. The algorithm that adjusts the difficulty of mining to maintain the 10 minutes only kicks in every two weeks or so. But the fun theory is that Satoshi was consciously echoing the six days that God takes to create the world in the Book of Genesis.\n\nHow are Bitcoin blocks different today?\n\nBitcoin blocks have changed a lot since 2009. They contain thousands of transactions, instead of one. They take 10 minutes to mine. Miners are rewarded with 6.25 BTC, after three \u201chalvings\u201d of the reward, which occur roughly every four years on a predetermined schedule. As of December 2022, there were more than 750,000 blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain. They form an unbroken sequence, each specifically referencing the previous one, stretching all the way back to the Genesis Block.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
