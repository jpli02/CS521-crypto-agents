        "title": "Did bitcoin leak from an American spy lab? - The Economist",
        "content": "Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.\n\nT he origins of covid-19 remain unknown. Most scientists think it jumped from wild animals to humans at a meat market in Wuhan. But it is also possible it escaped from a virology research lab in the same city.\n\nNow a similar argument has broken out around bitcoin, the first and most used cryptocurrency. Bitcoin\u2019s accepted origin is that it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous coder, who published a paper describing it in 2008 before later vanishing from sight.\n\nBut a theory circulating online holds that bitcoin was dreamed up by the National Security Agency ( NSA ), an American spy agency that also does cutting-edge cryptography research. \u201cI think it was a shuttered internal R & D project which one researcher thought was too good to lay fallow on the shelf and chose to secretly release,\u201d tweeted Nic Carter, a prominent bitcoin fan. Mr Carter and his fellow travellers think they have a smoking gun: a paper written in 1996 by NSA employees entitled \u201cHow to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash\u201d. And the paper cites work by a researcher named \u201cTatsuaki Okamoto\u201d.\n\nBut the paper is more smoke than gun. It is merely a survey of cryptographic ideas that might be used in digital cash. Unlike bitcoin, whose big innovation was its decentralised design, the schemes in the paper rely on an overseeing authority. It discusses the risks that electronic cash would pose to taxation and law enforcement. \u201cThus the idea that the NSA would develop a decentralised, trustless cryptocurrency as a \u2018monetary bioweapon\u2019 that would impair their own government\u2019s functions\u201d is implausible,\u201d writes David Rosenthal, a cryptocurrency sceptic, on his blog.\n\nJust another conspiracy theory, then? Almost certainly. But something similar has happened before. In 1997 it emerged that Clifford Cocks, a mathematician at GCHQ , Britain\u2019s NSA equivalent, had secretly invented a vital cryptographic technology that underlies both bitcoin and the internet in general, several years before the trio of American researchers who had been given credit.\n\nA better parallel between bitcoin and covid-19 may be that, like the virus, the cryptocurrency has proved hard to kill off. Despite a big crash last year, a bitcoin is still worth around $27,500. \u25a0"

        "title": "Bitcoin Edges Higher to $27.7K; AVAX, XRP Jump as Crypto Market Settles - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) edged higher Wednesday, gaining 1.3% over the past 24 hours as headwinds in traditional markets alleviated and crypto markets calmed after Monday\u2019s sharp rally.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at around $27,700 during U.S. afternoon hours. Earlier this week, BTC briefly rose above $28,000 then pared some of its gains.\n\nCrypto services provider Matrixport\u2019s analysts noted Wednesday that BTC broke out from its downtrend starting in the summer and turned the $27,000 level into support.\n\nThe report said BTC\u2019s price could be headed toward $30,000. However, the initial surge on Monday lacked a significant follow-through, as BTC trading volume dropped to $11 billion from $19 billion.\n\nEnigma Securities, an institutional digital asset liquidity and advisory firm, forecasted Wednesday in a report that low volatility on crypto markets will prevail for the next months.\n\nMarkets will likely consolidate and chop sideways in October, extending the window for accumulation for long-term investors, Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, noted in a market report.\n\nThe broader crypto market-proxy CoinDesk Market Index inched 0.8% higher.\n\nTraditional markets calmed after a turbulent Tuesday session as fresh jobs data pointed to a cooling U.S. labor market.\n\nThe ADP reported earlier today that the U.S. economy added 89,000 jobs in September, significantly less than the 153,000 analysts expected and August\u2019s 180,000. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that this was the smallest rise in private sector jobs since 2020.\n\nThe S&P 500 index closed the day 0.8% higher, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index posted a 1.45% gain.\n\nEther (ETH) price underperformed and slid 0.7% as market participants digested the disappointing first days of the first futures-based exchange-traded funds in the U.S. K33 Research advised investors to rotate into BTC, citing the lack of medium-term catalysts for ETH.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token SOL also pared its gains from earlier this week, slumping 2.3% in the past 24 hours. The token is still up over 20% in a week.\n\nLayer 1 blockchain Avalanche\u2019s AVAX was a top performer among major cryptocurrencies, surging 7%. XRP also rallied over 3% earlier in the day as Ripple\u2019s Asian arm obtained a license in Singapore and a favorable court ruling."
