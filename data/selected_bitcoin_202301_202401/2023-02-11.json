        "title": "Bitcoin logo imperfection found on original artwork after 12 years - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "While Satoshi Nakamoto is credited as the anonymous creator of Bitcoin (BTC), what often goes unnoticed are the selfless contributions of the community members \u2014 miners, developers, designers, hodlers and investors \u2014 that help materialize the original vision. However, one such significant contribution was found to carry an imperfection for over 12 years, invisible to the naked eye.\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2010, bitcointalk.org member bitboy (not related to YouTuber BitBoy Crypto) posted the vector files of the iconic Bitcoin logo, which has been widely accepted worldwide. While Bitcoiners preach the \u201czoom out\u201d narrative during crypto bear markets, zooming in on the original Bitcoin logo shows a small orange line from the background going into the white colored \u201c\u20bf.\u201d\n\nA small design detail that has stayed with many iterations of the original #bitcoin logo since its inception in 2010 pic.twitter.com/nYElwD2S6v \u2014 Doc (@_Bosch_) February 9, 2023\n\nThe information was first revealed by Crypto Twitter member @_Bosch_, who then shared an updated Bitcoin logo after removing the mark and improving the stylistic proportions. On further investigation, community member @skyler_fs found that one of the curvatures of the \u20bf logo was not smooth either.\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s investigation of the above claims confirmed the imperfections sported by the original Bitcoin vectors. The image below shows the two locations where the microscopic design issues exist.\n\nTwo imperfections found in the Bitcoin logo after 14 years. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nThe revelation does not impact how Bitcoin operates and community members have not shown any concerns about it. Even if someone were to create new vectors after fixing the flaws, it would not gain mainstream acceptance unless the community decides otherwise.\n\nRelated: Is it possible to achieve financial freedom with Bitcoin?\n\nAs markets maintain a positive trajectory toward recovery, Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark continues to amass equipment from distressed mining companies.\n\nCleanSpark\u2019s chief financial officer Gary Vecchiarelli said that the company envisions \u201cexplosive growth\u201d in 2023 through mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\u201cWith respect to our strategy regarding M&A, we have been one of the most active miners to date in acquiring infrastructure and machines, and we will continue to be active,\u201d he added."

        "content": "The Central American country became the first worldwide to adopt Bitcoin as a legal currency in 2021. The IMF said the government should be more transparent.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has urged the government of El Salvador to exercise greater transparency with its Bitcoin transactions, highlighting the cryptocurrency's \"risks.\"\n\nIn September 2021, El Salvador became the first country worldwide to introduce Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside the US dollar. El Salvador's Congress passed a law last month to regulate the issuance of other digital assets by the state and private entities.\n\nIn a report on Friday, the IMF once again warned the government regarding Bitcoin following a visit to the country.\n\n\"While risks have not materialized due to the limited bitcoin use so far,\" the IMF report said, the use of the cryptocurrency could grow, given new legislative reforms adopted to encourage its use.\n\nThe IMF noted that \"underlying risks to financial integrity and stability, fiscal sustainability, and consumer protection persist.\"\n\nHow has El Salvador embraced Bitcoin?\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele, reputed to be a tech enthusiast, is attempting to get more of the country's residents to use traceable ways of exchanging goods and money. Many Salvadorians do not have bank accounts.\n\nThe country rolled out a digital wallet, called Chivo, in September 2021, parallel to adopting Bitcoin as a legal currency. Many Salvadorans have since protested against the move and Bukele's policies in general.\n\nBukele then announced last November that the country's treasury would start buying a Bitcoin every day.\n\nThe Reuters news agency has calculated nearly 2,470 coins were acquired by the government for about $106.4 million (\u20ac99.4 million) since the announcement. The Salvadoran government doesn't officially disclose purchases, holdings or where the coins are kept.\n\nIn its statement, the IMF stressed the importance of \"greater transparency over the government's transactions in Bitcoin and the financial situation of the state-owned Bitcoin-wallet (Chivo).\"\n\nDespite the warnings, the IMF report applauded the growth of the Salvadoran economy by 2.8% in 2022. It cited the government's effective pandemic response, the \"unprecedented\" crime reduction and the strong tourism revenues as the reasons.\n\nAt the same time, IMF officials warned that Salvadoran exports and remittances could be affected by a pronounced slowdown in the US.\n\nBitcoin is now legal tender in El Salvador To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nrmt/dj (AFP, Reuters)"

        "title": "Bitcoin is already in its 'next bull market cycle' \u2014 Pantera Capital - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is beginning its \u201cseventh bull cycle,\u201d and investors should not be scared of crypto post-FTX, Pantera Capital believes.\n\nIn its latest \u201cBlockchain Letter\u201d on Feb. 8, the asset management firm\u2019s CEO, Dan Morehead, predicted that 2023 would be a \u201cyear for rebuilding trust.\u201d\n\nMorehead: Crypto assets have \u201cseen the lows\u201d this cycle\n\nWith BTC price action retracing slightly after gaining 40% in January, some market participants still insist that new macro lows are due across crypto assets.\n\nWhile the timing for such a scenario varies, consensus remains absent when it comes to how the market will rebound.\n\nFor Morehead, however, the time to flip bullish on crypto is already here.\n\n\u201cPantera has been through ten years of Bitcoin cycles and I\u2019ve traded through 35 years of similar cycles,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cI believe that blockchain assets have seen the lows and that we\u2019re in the next bull market cycle \u2013 regardless of what happens in the interest-rate-sensitive asset classes.\u201d\n\nThat perspective differs from the majority in casting aside the debate over crypto price correlation with risk assets such as equities. As Cointelegraph continues to report, this forms the backbone of some other prognoses for 2023.\n\nMorehead argued that the drawdown from Bitcoin\u2019s latest all-time highs had placed the market well within the historical context, despite dipping below its previous bull market all-time high after the FTX debacle in November 2022.\n\n\u201cThe decline from November 2021 to November 2022 was the median of the typical cycle. This is the only bear market to more than completely wipe out the previous bull market. In this case, giving back 136% of the previous rally,\u201d he wrote, alongside accompanying data.\n\n\u201cThe median downdraft has been 307 days and the previous bear market was 376. The median drawdown has been a -73% downdraft and the latest bear market ended at -77%.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, a trend change will ensue, with Bitcoin on its way to fresh record highs.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re done with that and beginning to grind higher,\u201d Morehead added.\n\nBitcoin price cycles chart (screenshot). Source: Pantera Capital\n\nA \u201cjurisdiction-by-jurisdiction\u201d recovery\n\nSimilar optimism was directed at the decentralized finance space, with Pantera nonetheless positioning for a year of \u201crebuilding trust\u201d in centralized finance (CeFi) first and foremost.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price taps 3-week lows as SEC fears liquidate $250M of crypto longs\n\nThis would be necessary, Morehead claimed, in light of last year\u2019s multiple corporate failures, which precipitated the crypto bear market.\n\n\u201c2022 was a year of booms and major busts, especially as it pertains to CeFi. In the span of a few months, the world saw Three Arrows Capital collapse, Do Kwon\u2019s LUNA disintegrate, Voyager Digital go bankrupt, and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s (SBF) FTX empire shatter,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cWhat did all these events have in common? The headlines like to suggest that it was crypto or Web3 that failed. But, in fact, it was a combination of bad actors skirting lines in jurisdictions without clear regulations. If 2022 was the year of breaking rules and failing, I believe 2023 is the year that entities instead follow the rules and enjoy the rewards of doing so.\u201d\n\nWhile the letter did not mention the current regulatory battle involving the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, it foresaw CeFi reclaiming its clout worldwide \u201con a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction level.\u201d\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Cathie Wood Thinks Bitcoin Is Going to $1.48 Million. Is She Right? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC 1.61%) turning in its best January performance since 2013, it's no surprise that analysts are ratcheting up their price targets for this suddenly hot crypto. Bitcoin was up nearly 40% in January, and that has led to a completely revised outlook for just how high this crypto could fly in coming years.\n\nCathie Wood of Ark Invest -- known for her previously controversial $1 million price target for Bitcoin -- has just ratcheted up her Bitcoin price prediction. She now thinks Bitcoin could skyrocket to $1.48 million by 2030. But just how feasible is that prediction?\n\nThe long-term growth story for Bitcoin\n\nAccording to Wood, the case for Bitcoin at these stratospheric levels is really a story of enormous growth on a global scale. Over time, the story goes, Bitcoin will account for a larger and larger share of global assets held by institutions. It will continue to scale globally as more nations accept it as legal tender, and as more people use Bitcoin to carry out online transactions.\n\nThis story gets more interesting when Ark Invest lays out the specific numbers behind its assumptions. Ark Invest suggests there will be eight primary market segments (e.g., \"emerging market currency\" and \"remittance asset\") where Bitcoin will see growth. Based on estimates about the penetration rate for Bitcoin in each of those markets, it is possible to develop a bearish, a base case, and a bullish scenario for Bitcoin's price.\n\nHow fast can Bitcoin grow?\n\nSo, for example, Ark Invest suggests that Bitcoin could account for up to 10% of the M2 money supply of emerging market countries. Thus far, there are only two nations that have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender -- El Salvador and the Central African Republic -- so this seems a bit optimistic. According to some economists, nations that struggle with hyperinflation or devalued currencies could decide to embrace Bitcoin.\n\nArk Invest also suggests that Bitcoin could capture 25% of the \"remittance asset\" market, and 50% of the \"digital gold\" market. So, imagine one in four migrants around the world sending money back to family and loved ones in the form of Bitcoin, and one in two central banks around the world deciding to build their Bitcoin reserves instead of their physical gold reserves. In addition, Ark Invest suggests that Bitcoin will soon account for 6.5% of institutional investor portfolio holdings.\n\nAll of these numbers are aggressive, but not entirely unthinkable. It really depends on how you view global growth, and how much faith you have in fiat currency.\n\nFrom my perspective, the \"base case\" estimates provided by Ark Invest make a lot more sense than the \"bullish case\" numbers. For example, in a base case scenario, Bitcoin will only account for 3% of the M2 money supply of emerging market countries. And Bitcoin will only account for 2.5% of institutional investor portfolios. The problem here is that even Ark Invest acknowledges that these \"base case\" assumptions only support a future price of $682,800 for Bitcoin, well below the pie-in-the-sky figure of $1.48 million.\n\nDo the numbers make sense?\n\nMoreover, it's helpful to stress-test these assumptions about Bitcoin against current asset values in global markets. Given that Bitcoin has a fixed coin supply of 21 million, a target price of $1.48 million implies a total market capitalization of $31 trillion.\n\nJust how big of a number is that? Well, the total value of the world's physical gold supply is estimated to be worth about $12 trillion, so Bitcoin would be worth more than 2.5x all the gold in the world today. Moreover, the total value of the S&P 500 is approximately $32 trillion. So, Bitcoin would be worth almost the same as the 500 largest publicly traded companies in America today.\n\nFor that reason, I don't think $1.48 million is a reasonable price target for Bitcoin. Even a $1 million price target seems to be a bit of wishful thinking on the part of the Bitcoin bulls. That would imply a market cap of $21 trillion, which is nearly 10x the current market cap of Apple. Would you rather own all the Bitcoin in the world, or all the equity in 10 different Apple corporations?\n\nWhile I'm long-term bullish on Bitcoin, I also think it's important to have a sense of scale here. If Warren Buffett thinks the value of all the Bitcoin in the world isn't even $25, and Cathie Wood thinks the value of all the Bitcoin in the world is $31 trillion, a rational person would say that the real value of Bitcoin is somewhere in the middle. I'm bullish that Bitcoin will eventually regain its $1 trillion market cap -- I just think it will take longer than some people think."

        "title": "Bitcoin miners as energy buyers, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Why does mining crypto use energy? The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a trade-off for the security and decentralization of blockchain networks. However, through the use of sustainable energy sources and effective mining algorithms, there are ongoing efforts to make the process more energy-efficient and sustainable. Mining crypto uses energy because it is a process that requires computers to perform complex mathematical calculations in order to validate transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain. These calculations use a lot of computer resources, which results in high energy usage. The main sources of energy consumption are the CPUs and GPUs, as well as the cooling systems necessary to keep mining rigs cool. The first step in mining cryptocurrency is to confirm the transactions on the blockchain network using a consensus algorithm such as proof-of-work, which calls for miners to solve challenging mathematical puzzles. Miners use specialized software and hardware, such as ASICs, to perform these calculations at high speeds. The first miner to solve the puzzle adds the following block to the blockchain and receives a specific quantity of Bitcoin (BTC) in return. In order to increase their odds of becoming the first to solve the puzzle, miners are motivated to employ as much computer power as they can. As more miners join the network and competition heats up, the need for energy rises, resulting in increased electricity usage. According to some estimates, the entire energy use of the Bitcoin network alone might be comparable to that of a small nation. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a concern because it has an environmental impact. The majority of the power required for mining is generated from fossil fuels, which cause the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. The cost of electricity for mining can be rather high in some areas, which makes it less economical for miners.\n\nDo Bitcoin miners use renewable energy resources to mine? While a sizable fraction of Bitcoin mining currently uses non-renewable energy sources, there is a growing tendency among miners to power their operations with renewable energy sources. It is likely that more miners will use renewable energy as it becomes more affordable to power their operations. As already noted, Bitcoin mining uses a lot of energy for miners to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain by using powerful computers to solve challenging mathematical puzzles. Initially, the majority of Bitcoin mining took place in China, which is also the biggest generator of coal-based electricity in the world. As a result, non-renewable energy sources accounted for a sizable amount of the energy utilized to mine BTC. When comparing Bitcoin mining by nation, the United States ranks the highest, making it a legal activity after Bitcoin mining was outlawed in China. The use of renewable energy sources by miners, such as hydroelectricity, is an increasing trend, though. This is especially true in areas with a wealth of renewable energy sources, such as Quebec and Iceland. Additionally, due to a fall in the price of renewable energy sources, mining companies are beginning to use them to power their operations. Moreover, in order to fuel their mining operations, several businesses are also investing in their own renewable energy initiatives, such as solar and wind farms.\n\nHow do Bitcoin miners act as energy buyers? To power their mining operations, Bitcoin miners either purchase electricity from conventional and renewable energy sources or develop and run their own renewable energy facilities, turning them into energy consumers. Miners typically purchase electricity from energy providers, such as utility companies or independent power producers, to mine BTC. They then use that electricity to power their mining equipment. This can include both traditional energy sources, such as coal or natural gas, as well as renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind energy. Hydro-Quebec, a Canadian utility company that sells electricity to Bitcoin miners, is a real-world example of how Bitcoin miners act as energy buyers. In order to take advantage of the low electricity prices in the province, the firm has been actively courting Bitcoin miners to establish operations there and utilize excess hydroelectric power to mine BTC. In some circumstances, miners might also sign long-term agreements with energy suppliers, which could provide them access to a more reliable and consistent source of electricity. Large-scale miners can benefit the most from this, as it enables them to plan and budget for their energy requirements in advance. By establishing and running their own renewable energy facilities, such as solar or wind farms, Bitcoin miners can also take on the role of energy users and function as energy purchasers. By doing this, they support the switch to sustainable energy sources as well as securing energy for their mining activities. For instance, a Bitcoin miner called Genesis Mining has established operations in Iceland and is running them using geothermal and hydroelectric energy. This allows the miner to benefit from Iceland\u2019s plentiful renewable energy resources and lessen its environmental impact. Additionally, one of the largest Bitcoin mining facilities in the world, KnCMiner, is powered by a wind farm that the company developed on its own land in Sweden. To make use of extra energy that would otherwise be wasted, miners may also choose to locate their mining operations next to existing renewable energy facilities, such as hydroelectric dams or geothermal plants. For instance, the Bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation in upstate New York, U.S. generates electricity for its mining operations using extra natural gas from a local power plant. The company also constructed a 7-megawatt solar farm to help meet its energy requirements.\n\nHow do renewable energy resources benefit Bitcoin mining in rural areas? Renewable energy sources offer a more reliable power supply for Bitcoin mining operations since they are less prone to experiencing power disruptions. Additionally, using sustainable energy for Bitcoin mining can support job growth and economic expansion in rural areas. In the context of Bitcoin, gridless computing, which refers to the usage of alternative computing resources such as edge devices, can encourage the use of renewable energy resources to mine BTC in Africa. That said, gridless computing offers an alternative to the centralized electrical grid, which is often unreliable or unavailable in many parts of the continent. This can enable miners to operate in remote or off-grid locations using locally generated renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power. The lack of electrical infrastructure in many rural parts of Africa makes it challenging to establish and run conventional mining operations. Gridless computing, on the other hand, enables miners to power their mining machinery with portable, decentralized renewable energy sources like solar or wind turbines. This enables miners to establish operations in remote locations and make use of the region\u2019s abundant renewable energy resources. Gridless computing can also promote the growth of community-based mining operations, which can assist nearby areas economically by generating jobs and sources of income. By offering education and training on sustainable energy methods, these community-based mining companies can also encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources."
