        "content": "Bitcoin Country seeks to generate world-class Bitcoin and Lightning engineers through a new program utilizing the university system.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Office has announced a new six month educational program entitled \u201cCUBO+\u201d that aims to produce elite-level Bitcoin and Lighting developers through the Salvadoran university system.\n\nAccording to the Office, the program, beginning in May, will consist of a relatively small group of students, under 25, narrowed down from some of the brightest students in El Salvador\u2019s universities. The first group will be through students at the University of Don Bosco. They will be competing for the inaugural Plan B Fellowship, funded by Tether and Fulgur Ventures. The project is a result of the recently announced agreement between El Salvador and Lugano, Switzerland for the world\u2019s first Bitcoin Embassy in the Swiss city.\n\nThe program will be led and taught by some of the brightest minds in Bitcoin who will be announced soon. Classes will range in topics from high-level technical development specific to Bitcoin, to distributed technologies such as Holepunch, Nostr and Web5. Private funding is responsible for the program, and all students who qualify for the Plan B Fellowship will receive a stipend in order for them to cover the costs of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first two months of the program will be online, followed by a two week in-person bootcamp, featuring intense full-day courses located in San Salvador. The remaining months will include close online mentorship with the top names in Bitcoin.\n\nThe information shared with Bitcoin Magazine described how the program will become a framework upon which others can utilize as an open-source standard for high-level Bitcoin education. Educational experts are participating in the course design which promises to set the standard for other nations to follow.\n\nStudents who complete the course will be presented with various options for continuing their Bitcoin journey, including the option to take on a full-time job at reputable Bitcoin companies. Otherwise, entrepreneurial opportunities and continuing education will be available.\n\nThe name Cubo+ is derived from a project that President Nayib Bukele started in his Mayor position of San Salvador. When he was mayor, the city would erect buildings in areas that were impoverished, and these buildings served as libraries and community centers for furthering education. The program hopes to draw on this inspiration for building El Salvador\u2019s future.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nFilip Radwanski | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin is up 50% this year despite the collapse of major crypto-focused banks, beating major stock indexes and commodities. On Jan. 1, bitcoin began trading at just over $16,500. On Wednesday, it was hovering around the $25,000 mark, thanks to a rally that began on Sunday. The surge in price this year comes after bitcoin crashed 65% in 2022 after a number of major collapses of projects and hedge funds, bankruptcies, liquidity issues and the failure of FTX, one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. The recent rise has come as somewhat of a surprise, given the closure of Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank, two of the biggest lenders to the crypto industry. And Silicon Valley Bank, viewed as the backbone of the technology startup industry, also failed.\n\n\"Bitcoin's 50% surge in 2023 is a reflection of how beaten down it was post the FTX collapse, the changing interest rate outlook and the failure (& resurrection) of SVB,\" Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto trading platform Nexo, told CNBC. From its peak of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin is still down more than 60%. Here are some of the main reasons bitcoin is up.\n\nBank collapses\n\nWhile the collapse of Silvergate, Signature Bank and SVB sent shockwaves through financial markets, bitcoin's rebound could also be fueled by those very failures, according to Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno. \"This past week's events around the failure of SVB and other banks have also shone a spotlight on the power of decentralised currencies that people can fully custody and own,\" Ayyar said. \"Decentralised finance is beginning to hit home in terms of a concept to many more people now.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin is called a decentralized currency because it isn't issued by a single entity like a central bank. Instead, it relies on an underlying technology called blockchain and its network is maintained by a community. U.S. regulators had to step in to guarantee customer deposits at these banks, however. Nexo's Trenchev said the intervention \"reminded investors about the structural deficiencies of the U.S. banking system and the U.S. dollar underpinning it, reasons why we've seen a flight to Bitcoin this week.\" Bitcoin proponents have claimed the digital currency is a way for investors to protect themselves against central bank moves, particularly quantitative easing and looser monetary policy, which they say erodes the value of fiat currency. Proponents point to bitcoin's finite supply as a key feature of it being a store of value.\n\nInterest rate outlook\n\nThe bank collapses came after a year of interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve. SVB's issue was that it had to sell off assets, mainly Treasurys, to shore up its balance sheet as depositors withdrew funds. But it sold those assets at a hefty loss because interest rate rises had pushed the price of Treasurys lower. Some analysts have suggested the stress on the financial sector could slow down the pace of rate hikes from the Fed, which could help risk assets, such as stocks and bitcoin. That came even after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said days before the bank collapses that rates are likely to be higher than policymakers anticipated.\n\n\"In the space of a few days we'd turned from a hawkish Powell to an environment where economists were predicting the Fed might not even hike rates in March, benefiting Bitcoin,\" Trenchev said. \"It's been said that the Fed will only stop hiking rates when they break something, and now that something is broken, attention has turned to Bitcoin.\"\n\nBitcoin vs. stocks"
