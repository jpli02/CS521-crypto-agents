        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, today brought a mix of intriguing developments that are sure to capture the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and traditional finance professionals. From Bitcoin's resurgence on the back of weak Chinese economic data to the buzz around PayPal's stablecoin, here's a comprehensive roundup of the day's most significant crypto news.\n\nBitcoin Climbs to the $30K Mark As Global Yields Decline\n\nBitcoin's price saw a 3% uptick, climbing to just shy of $30,000 in response to a plunge in global long-dated government bond yields. This fall in yields was triggered by China's far weaker than anticipated trade numbers for July. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield tumbled below the 4% mark. These macroeconomic shifts have seemingly buoyed the crypto market, with other notable cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON), and Chainlink (LINK) registering gains of over 4% at the time of writing.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Rises 3% to Challenge $30K After Weak China Data Sends Yields Plunging\n\nBeware of Fake PayPal USD Tokens\n\nWith PayPal's recent stablecoin announcement, scammers are attempting to capitalize on the hype by releasing counterfeit PYUSD tokens on various blockchains. This serves as a cautionary tale for investors to exercise due diligence and verify the authenticity of tokens before making any transactions.\n\nRead More: Fake PayPal USD Tokens Pop up on Several Blockchains\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs: A Glimmer of Hope\n\nProminent figures in the crypto space, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, have expressed optimism regarding the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC. With several applications pending, the crypto community eagerly awaits a positive decision, which could further legitimize and boost the adoption of cryptocurrencies\n\nRead More: Cathie Wood and Mike Novogratz Are Both Bullish on Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals\n\nAccording to \"contacts\" from inside BlackRock and Invesco spot Bitcoin ETF approval a matter of \"when, not if\" likely in \"four to six months\" -- Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz on earnings call this morning pic.twitter.com/TIhHC7xnHI \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 8, 2023\n\nHuobi Sees Influx from a Crypto Whale\n\nHuobi, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, received substantial deposits from a crypto whale, including $200 million USDT and 5,000 ether (ETH). These transactions come amidst a backdrop of continued outflows from the exchange.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Huobi Receives $200M USDT, $9M Ether From Whale\n\nReddit's Community Tokens Gain Traction on Kraken\n\nReddit's community tokens, Moons (MOON) and Bricks (BRICK), experienced significant price surges following their listing on Kraken.

        "title": "Bitcoin Isn't Going Away, Says David Rubenstein - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nThis is perfectly timed because Novogratz has been the pinata of Bitcoin when it goes down. It's been the genius of Bitcoin when it goes up and all of a sudden Larry showed up at the door to say, Hey, big, respectable firms can prosecute and do Bitcoin. Link Lawrence Fink of BlackRock to Mike Novogratz. Well, what's happened is people, as you suggest, make fun of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But now the establishment of Larry Fink at BlackRock is now saying they're going to have an ETF if approved by the government in Bitcoin. So you're saying, wait a second, the mighty BlackRock is willing to have an ETF in Bitcoin. Maybe Bitcoin is going to be around for a while. Lisa wants to jump in here, but I'm going to cut to the news moment. Is Carlyle announcing this morning a Bitcoin advocacy? No, I don't think so. But there's no doubt that Bitcoin is something that I wish I had bought it at $100 a bitcoin when Mike Novogratz started buying, it's now at $29,000. So he's made a lot of money and a lot of people who bought it at $100 or less are feeling pretty good now. It went up as high as 61,000, I think even down to 31,000 or even 29,000. Now, there's still a pretty good profit if you're bought in 100. We all wish we would have bought it at 100 and to write it up. It's one thing for BlackRock to come up with an ETF because they believe the proposition of Bitcoin. It's another because they see a profitability proposition where they can, you know, basically take advantage of the interest other people have. I mean, isn't that more of what this is that basically Wall Street is saying if there is a market for it and we can viably make one for them and make some money, why not? Well, remember, Wall Street is in business to make money and this is something they can probably make money off. You have to remember, the United States government has been somewhat skeptical of it. I think Democrats in the Congress and particularly the people regulating the FCC are skeptical of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But outside the United States, there's a lot of interest in it. I think FCX really hurt when it went bankrupt and it hurt the the crypto industry. But a lot of people around the world want to be able to trade in a currency that their government can't know what they have and they want to be at a moving around, rightly or wrongly. And so I don't think Bitcoin is going away. I think the Republicans on Capitol Hill have been pretty supportive of it. There's a difference between having a seamless cross-currency payment, basically saying that instead of going to Western Union, I can go and just transfer something in Bitcoin if it has a stable enough price. That's one proposition. But the proposition of Bitcoin as a store of value, that could kind of be bid up the way that gold or silver could seems to have been sparked with the advent of yield suddenly that you can get for actual money. I mean, isn't that sort of the feeling that you're getting? Well, there's no doubt that when when interest rates are as high as they are, you don't need to have gold or other kinds of things to get you some solid return, because when you get 5% on Treasuries, but eventually 5% will be coming down at some point. I don't think Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies that are the better ones, the better known ones, Bitcoin. And so a number of others are going to go away. There's enormous interest around the world in being able to have something you can transfer without the government knowing about it and keep it private. And you know, you can say, well, people shouldn't do that, but that's not going to stop people from doing it. Mr. Novogratz And Mr. Gensler, what did he say about the efforts of our chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who's the chairman of the SEC, is not a big fan of cryptocurrencies. I think that's fair to say. But he lost a major case recently in court where he was trying to argue that one of the cryptocurrencies ripple was was a security and he lost that case. So I think the SEC has not been able to convince these the government yet, or at least the courts that cryptocurrency is such a dangerous thing. And I remember a lot of people in the government now are thinking that Gary Gensler won't be the chairman of the SEC for ever going to go. I mean, these guys just wait them out, right? I think that's a strategy that's very popular in Washington, waiting out regulators who don't like."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Long term investors continue accumulating Bitcoin, despite the asset\u2019s recent price action, industry experts told Forkast.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin plunges under US$30,000 amid market turbulence. Is US$27,000 next?\n\nDogecoin leads declines across most top 10 cryptos\n\nBitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,161 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it fell below the US$30,000 support level on July 24. Despite struggling to rally higher in recent weeks, industry experts say that Bitcoin\u2019s accumulation remains robust among long-term holders.\n\n\u201cWhat we see today is very similar to this stage of previous cycles \u2013 an absence of speculative activity and intense accumulation with coins moving to high conviction, sticky hands \u2013 with more in cold storage than ever before,\u201d wrote Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, to Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe metrics we track that encapsulate asset-accumulation behavior have never been more robust. Nearly 75% of the issued supply is held in wallets where the coins haven\u2019t moved for more than six months. And for the first time, there are now over 1 million \u201cwhole Bitcoiners\u201d \u2013 people owning at least 1 full BTC.\u201d\n\nIn the crypto market, Ether rose 0.21% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,828 and declined 0.36% during the past week.\n\nDogecoin was the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, after it fell 1.54% in the past 24 hours to US$0.07352, followed by Polkadot\u2019s DOT token that declined 0.57% to US$4.96.\n\nLeading the winners, the XRP coin rose 1.05% to US$0.6203, followed by Solana\u2019s SOL token that gained 0.68% to US$23.24\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.21% to US$1.16 trillion while market volume increased 42.48% to US$32.32 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nStory continues\n\nPayPal\u2019s stablecoin lifts NFT sales on Ethereum, top NFT blockchains\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.69% to 2,476.83 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 1.3% during the week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales continued yesterday\u2019s decline, falling 14.92% to US$365,955 with the network slipping to the eighth largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales recovered after yesterday\u2019s slump, rising 19.43% to US$8.05 million, while sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, declined 10.40% to US$563,891. Its twin collection, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, rose 26.24% to US$630,187, becoming the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection by 24-hour sales volume.\n\n\u201cA rare day in the green with sales volume across most blockchains up double-digit percentages. Bitcoin however is still struggling,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cPaypal announcing the launch of a stablecoin has excited the NFT market a bit, as they look forward to an easy way to onboard the masses to crypto.\u201d\n\nPaypal launched the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin on Monday. The Ethereum-based token is issued by Paxos Trust Company \u2013 the U.S.-based issuer of Binance\u2019s BUSD stablecoin \u2013 and is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. treasuries and similar cash equivalents.\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast SOL NFT Composite and the Forkast POL NFT Composite were the only ones in the green for the day.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures fall as investors await key U.S. inflation data\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities declined as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, except Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 that rose for a second consecutive day. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posted declines.\n\nInvestor appetite remained subdued, after China\u2019s trade figures showed that exports from the country fell by 14.5% in July, the biggest fall since the beginning of the pandemic. Imports also dropped at the highest pace since January.\n\nDespite yesterday\u2019s strong session, U.S. stock futures fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all declining.\n\nTraders remained cautious ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data for July, scheduled for Thursday, as this can also signal the path for further interest rate decisions.\n\nOn the corporate front, investors are now anticipating earnings from companies like UPS, Zoetis and Duke Energy Corporation.\n\nEuropean equities fell on Tuesday, extending Monday\u2019s decline, with the Dax losing 0.9% and the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling 0.71%, as markets lacked notable catalysts.\n\nSee related article: Standard Chartered\u2019s great expectations for Bitcoin in 2024\n\nUpdates with equities section"
