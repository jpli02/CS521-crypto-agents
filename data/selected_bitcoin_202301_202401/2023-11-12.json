        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Revenue Hits Yearly Highs of Over $42.3M - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin Mining Revenue Hits Yearly Highs of Over $42.3M\n\nOn November 9, Bitcoin mining revenue reached a new yearly peak, totaling $42,386,514.038, surpassing the previous high of $41,744,197.067 in May 2023, as per data from Blockchain.com. This surge coincided with Bitcoin's price spiking to over $37,000 on the same day, driven by heightened expectations surrounding the potential approval of a U.S. spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe upswing in mining revenue is attributed to the combined impact of Bitcoin's price increase and heightened network activity. Lane Kasselman, President of Blockchain.com, pointed out that increased network congestion results in higher transaction fees, contributing to miners' earnings. While network congestion in May was influenced by demand for Ordinals\u2014a concept akin to NFTs\u2014the current surge is primarily linked to the escalating price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe anticipation of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approval has played a pivotal role in the recent price rally. The SEC, known for historically rejecting Bitcoin ETF applications, is facing a unique situation with the expiration of deadlines for rebuttal comments on multiple pending ETF applications, potentially leading to the simultaneous approval of 12 Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "What Is Paul Krugman's Problem With Bitcoin? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Paul Krugman is a Distinguished Professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center and a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He is published regularly in the New York Times and is known for his skepticism of cryptocurrency and blockchain.\n\nKey Takeaways Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman has never been a fan of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.\n\nKrugman argues that these digital tokens serve no economic purpose and that their valuation is tenuous.\n\nWhether or not Bitcoin is genuinely a bubble remains to be seen, but many prominent thinkers strongly disagree with Krugman's position.\n\nUnderstanding Paul Krugman's Position\n\nPaul Krugman bases his opinions and stance on cryptocurrencies on his years of economics study, teaching, and expertise.\n\nIn a 2018 New York Times op-ed titled \"Transaction Costs and Tethers: Why I'm a Crypto Skeptic,\" crypto-skeptic Paul Krugman wrote:\n\n\u201cWhat problem does this technology solve? What does it do that other, much cheaper and easier-to-use technologies can\u2019t do just as well or better? I still haven\u2019t heard a clear answer.\"\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist's sentiments haven't changed much since the 2018 op-ed he filed from vacation in Europe, a result of his pondering of bitcoin and blockchain while \"hiking and biking in various parts of Europe.\"\n\n\n\nThat year, he stated that it set the monetary system back by 300 years when gold was the primary form of exchange and that there didn't seem to be a clear upside to this regression. Krugman still made the claim three years later:\n\n\"Because Bitcoin and its relatives haven\u2019t managed to achieve any meaningful economic role, what happens to their value is basically irrelevant to those of us not playing the crypto game.\"\n\nMultiple Strikes Against Bitcoin?\n\nThroughout his published op-eds, Krugman describes why more caution and regulation are needed for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\nCosts\n\nThe transaction costs for gold are high because it's heavy and bulky and is considerably expensive to store. Fiat currencies incur lower, but still significant, transaction costs because they are paper-based. Subsequent shifts towards checks and credit and debit cards have further decreased the need and costs for paper-based currency.\n\nIn turn, this has led to them being widely adopted by countries around the world. That they are widely accepted provides further impetus for their use. In contrast, bitcoin has significant transaction costs in the form of its energy requirements. It is also not widely accepted, and that further increases the costs required to conduct practical commerce using Bitcoin.\n\nLack of Tethering\n\nBitcoin has a lack of tethering capability. In practical terms, this means there are no real backstops available to it as they are to paper money and gold. Government backing provides credibility to paper money. Gold has practical applications in jewelry and industry, which provide \"a weak but real tether to the real economy.\"\n\nBecause of its digital and stateless nature, bitcoin has neither a physical application nor a central authority to vouch for its status as a medium of exchange. \"If speculators were to have a collective moment of doubt, suddenly fearing that Bitcoins were worthless, well, Bitcoins would become worthless,\" writes Krugman.\n\nIn a June 2021 op-ed, along with the opinion that stablecoins like TerraUSD start as a way to keep third parties out of transactions but eventually end up needing them to operate as a stablecoin, Krugman furthered his stance on a lack of tethering, pointing to TerraUSD's loss of its peg to the dollar and eventual collapse. As it turns out, the only way to truly be stable, pegged, or tethered is to hold an amount of currency (or an equal value of property) equal to the total intended value of the cryptocurrency (such as $1,000 for 1,000 tokens).\n\nIt's a Bubble\n\nTo be sure, Krugman has maintained a steady position against Bitcoin. In 2018, Krugman said that the cryptocurrency was an obvious bubble. He said its prices were rising because \"Early investors in a bubble make a lot of money as new investors are drawn in, and those profits pull in even more people. The process can go on for years before something\u2014a reality check, or simply exhaustion of the pool of potential marks\u2014brings the party to a sudden, painful end.\"\n\nNo Hard Evidence to Oppose His Opinions\n\nHe has argued in a similar manner in more recent op-eds, reiterating his belief that Bitcoin is a scam, bubble, and designed by people who don't understand the fundamentals of a fiat currency system. Many of his opponents respond with, in his words, \"technobabble,\" which doesn't offer any oppositional evidence. Some of his main points over the years are:\n\nPonzi and pyramid schemes excel where there is a strong narrative, and Krugman believes that the \"narrative\" is where crypto \"really excels.\"\n\nBitcoin has turned out not to be inflation-proof.\n\nMost investors buy cryptocurrencies through exchanges, which take their money and hold their keys for them, creating the need for trust in a financial environment designed to dispel the need for trust.\n\nCryptocurrency has only gained its status through association with institutions and individuals playing on their trustworthiness.\n\nWhat Is Paul Krugman's Theory? Paul Krugman won his Nobel Prize for disputing that countries produce different goods due to their different circumstances. He claimed that economies of scale meant similar countries producing similar products dominate world trade.\n\nWhere Did Paul Krugman Go to College? Paul Krugman earned his Ph.D. in economics from MIT and his bachelors from Yale.\n\nWhat Awards Has Paul Krugman Won? Most notably, he has won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and the John Bates Clark Medal. Other awards include the Adam Smith Award, the Howland Memorial Prize, and the H.C. Recktenwald Prize in Economics from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPaul Krugman is a well-respected and award-winning economist with a strong stance against Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption and use. He makes many excellent and concerning points in his op-eds that are contested by cryptocurrency fans and investors and lauded by other skeptics.\n\n\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Rebuild or retreat? Crypto faces tough choices after FTX - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nHours after Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of FTX and poster child of the crypto industry, was convicted of fraud and money laundering in New York, one of his leading venture capital backers had his say.\n\n\u201cImmediately after FTX collapsed, we extensively reviewed our due diligence process and evaluated our 18-month working relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried,\u201d said Alfred Lin, partner at Sequoia Capital. \u201cWe concluded that we had been deliberately misled and lied to.\u201d\n\nCrypto sceptics would argue that Lin was hardly the first to be taken in. Ever since bitcoin was created in 2009, the industry has variously been associated with illicit trading, such as the now defunct Silk Road marketplace, or business failures such as the 2014 collapse of Mt Gox, which at its peak handled almost three-quarters of all bitcoin in circulation.\n\nAt the height of his power, Bankman-Fried was seen as the industry\u2019s most likely route to respectability. Alongside Sequoia, FTX boasted mainstream backers such as Tiger Global, Singapore\u2019s state-owned Temasek and the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan.\n\nIn Washington, Bankman-Fried testified before congressional committees, supported more regulation and became a major political donor.\n\nIn the Bahamas, where FTX was based, Prime Minister Philip Davis championed the company as a marquee acquisition as the Caribbean country\u2019s economy sought its next economic boost.\n\nMeanwhile, FTX secured celebrity endorsements and signed sponsorship deals with Major League Baseball, the Miami Heat basketball franchise and the International Cricket Council. It filmed a Super Bowl advertisement with actor and producer Larry David.\n\nA giant screen shows Sam Bankman-Fried at a cryptocurrency conference in the Bahamas \u00a9 FT montage\n\nBut on November 2, a 12-person New York jury needed less than five hours to reach unanimous agreement that Bankman-Fried was guilty of seven charges.\n\n\u201cSam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d said US attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams. \u201cThis kind of fraud, this kind of corruption is as old as time, and we have no patience for it.\u201d\n\nAs crypto\u2019s former leading light contemplates a possible lengthy jail sentence, the industry he championed could go one of two ways: either it collectively regroups and tries \u2014 all over again \u2014 to be accepted in the world of mainstream finance, or it falls back on its longstanding image as a niche market for speculators, day traders and those who fervently believe money should remain separate from the state.\n\nFor John Reed Stark, former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s office of internet enforcement, the trial verdict is \u201ca death knell for crypto, Web 3 and blockchain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an industry that has run its course,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it all went away tomorrow, it wouldn\u2019t impact a single person on the planet other than the speculator.\u201d\n\nBut others believe the industry can recover from the debacle of the Bankman-Fried trial and become a part of mainstream finance.\n\n\u201cCrypto\u2019s public image is at an all-time low, but the industry isn\u2019t done yet,\u201d says Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto futures index platform Phuture.\n\nAn inglorious history\n\nThe ignominious conclusion of Bankman-Fried\u2019s career follows more than a decade of non-compliance with traditional financial rules, run-ins with regulators around the world, and accusations that cryptocurrencies are used to fund terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the computing power needed to \u201cmine\u201d crypto assets like bitcoin generates a carbon footprint roughly equivalent to a country the size of Ukraine.\n\nFTX\u2019s bankruptcy in 2022 capped off a crisis of confidence that resulted in popular digital assets such as bitcoin and ether losing more than half their value. Other once prominent firms like Terraform Labs and Three Arrows Capital also collapsed.\n\nIn response, lawmakers and regulators in multiple jurisdictions stepped up their oversight of the sector to unprecedented levels during 2023. US regulators have issued a blitz of enforcement cases and lawsuits against some of the biggest crypto companies still standing. They include US-listed Coinbase \u2014 which is facing an SEC lawsuit after allegedly violating securities laws \u2014 and Binance, FTX\u2019s great rival and the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by some distance.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance in March, alleging it had illegally accessed US customers and that it knew it facilitated potentially illegal activities.\n\nBinance is now the biggest crypto exchange but the company and its chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, face regulatory action from both the CFTC and SEC \u00a9 FT montage/Reuters\n\nThree months later, the SEC filed a lawsuit of its own against Binance, alleging that it had mixed customers\u2019 cash with a separate trading firm owned by its chief executive Changpeng Zhao. Both Binance and Coinbase have denied the allegations and said they will fight their respective lawsuits.\n\nIn the wake of the October 7 atrocities, Israeli law enforcement authorities closed more than 100 Binance accounts and identified about 150 crypto donation initiatives affiliated with Hamas, prompting renewed allegations about the industry\u2019s ties to financing terrorism and fresh calls for a crackdown.\n\n\u201cThis industry came to prominence after the failure of Mt Gox and the controversy of Silk Road,\u201d says Charley Cooper, a former chief of staff at the CFTC. \u201cThroughout its history, it has had multiple scandals \u2014 as a far greater proportion of their market \u2014 than any other industry has had.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of doctors are not defrauding the healthcare system, the majority of lawyers are not violating court ethics. The Wall Street guys, you can call them greedy, but they\u2019re not breaking the law,\u201d Cooper adds.\n\nYesha Yadav, professor of law at Vanderbilt Law School, describes Bankman-Fried\u2019s conviction as \u201ca monumentally important moment\u201d for the wider crypto sector. \u201cThat the jury came back so decisively really highlights how far and how deeply a key symbol of the industry had fallen . . . it\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger reputational hit.\u201d\n\nThose working in the industry are concerned that their career prospects could be damaged as a result. One professional who contacted the Financial Times says he is \u201ca little concerned with how being affiliated with crypto could be perceived for recruiting for traditional industries.\u201d\n\nHe has lost money with FTX as well as Voyager, another crypto company that collapsed last year. \u201cThe experience has made me a lot more conservative,\u201d he adds.\n\nCrypto glasnost\n\nAfter FTX filed for bankruptcy last November, influential voices in the sector called for a renewed focus on transparency.\n\nBinance\u2019s Zhao said \u201call crypto exchanges\u201d should provide proof of reserves and committed his own business to \u201cfull transparency\u201d. Days later, rival exchange OKX said it was launching its first proof of reserves \u201cto set a new standard of transparency, risk management and user protection\u201d.\n\nBut according to figures from industry data provider CCData, only about a third of crypto exchanges currently offer proof of reserves or alternatives, such as regularly audited financial statements.\n\nThose exchanges that have offered some form of financial transparency to their customers account for about 81 per cent of the market, but that is down from 86 per cent in March \u2014 and about the level it was in November 2022, when FTX went bust.\n\nAccording to Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, this suggests that \u201cproof of reserves might have become less discerning to users compared to the early months after the collapse of FTX\u201d.\n\nJames Newman, co-head of perfORM Due Diligence Services Limited, says the largest and most influential of exchanges \u201chave taken steps to bring additional transparency over the assets they hold\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are many that have been slow in adopting proof of reserves,\u201d he adds, saying it is \u201clikely symptomatic of the continued dominance of retail money held on exchanges who do not speak as one voice\u201d.\n\nRetail traders \u2014 individuals trading for themselves \u2014 have been instrumental in the sector\u2019s growth. But many feel it now needs to widen its appeal. \u201cCrypto\u2019s survival relies on external support and belief from other industries,\u201d says Storry. \u201cRetail is on board, but we now need institutional backing to take the industry to the next level.\u201d\n\nThere are signs this is happening. In the summer, payments giant PayPal became the first major financial institution to launch a US dollar-pegged crypto token. The company has offered trading in the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrencies since 2020, but the launch of a so-called stablecoin \u2014 a crypto asset whose price tracks that of a more recognised asset, often a conventional currency \u2014 marked a major boon for a troubled sector.\n\nEven greater hopes for institutional backing rest on BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, gaining SEC approval to launch a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund. That would allow investors to speculate on bitcoin within a regulated financial vehicle run by a recognised name.\n\nLast month, as speculation grew over BlackRock\u2019s application possibly being approved, bitcoin\u2019s price surged to $35,000, erasing all the losses it had racked up since the crypto market crisis began in May 2022.\n\nRegulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission under Gary Gensler, have been wrestling with how to regulate crypto asset trading \u00a9 FT montage/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cThere are signs of entry into this industry if you know where to look: we are talking about BlackRock launching a bitcoin exchange traded fund and PayPal launching a dollar-pegged stablecoin,\u201d says Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at financial services firm Marex.\n\nBut nothing is set in stone. The SEC, led by chair Gary Gensler, has so far resisted approving any such applications and may never give BlackRock \u2014 or any other candidate \u2014 the green light to take bitcoin to the mass market.\n\nLawmakers have also turned more circumspect. Last month, Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative French Hill urged the Department of Justice to consider criminal charges against Binance and Tether, the largest trading exchange and the largest stablecoin issuer, respectively.\n\nFollowing Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel, more than 100 lawmakers from both major political parties in the US signed a letter urging the Biden administration to outline the steps it is taking to mitigate cryptocurrencies being used as a means of financing terrorism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder to get legislation passed in the US, and there will now be a colder reception in Congress,\u201d says one crypto industry lobbyist in Washington. It remains to be seen in 2024, whether Coinbase and Binance are as willing \u2014 or even as able \u2014 to lobby regulators and politicians as FTX once was.\n\nBack to first principles\n\nThe irony of crypto\u2019s push for respectability is not lost on Reed Stark, the ex-SEC executive. \u201cAll of these crypto guys are now crying out for a bitcoin ETF, but started the bitcoin project because they were upset about the 2008 banking crisis. They were upset about the government being able to surveil their financial transactions,\u201d he points out.\n\n\u201cSo what do they do? They rally around one of the biggest financial services companies in the world because there\u2019s nothing left. It\u2019s the ultimate hypocrisy,\u201d he adds.\n\nCustomers protesting outside the offices of Mt Gox\u2019s operator in Tokyo in 2014. The failure of the exchange presaged many of crypto\u2019s current problems \u00a9 FT montage/Bloomberg\n\nBut while many in the industry have pinned their hopes on a mainstream future, another branch would prefer crypto to go back to its roots.\n\nErik Voorhees, founder of crypto platform ShapeShift and an unabashed libertarian, last month issued a rallying cry to those still faithful to the original crypto cause.\n\n\u201cWhy do we accept this world in which we are free to transact only on the conditional approval of strangers?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis of course is not freedom. It is subservience, it is serfdom, and that the chains bear lightly down in most cases should not lull us into forgetting that the chains exist.\u201d\n\nInstead of walking head first into an increasingly hostile crowd of regulators and lawmakers, Voorhees and others like him are pushing for the industry to go back to first principles: permissionless finance that stands as an explicit rejection of the establishment, government oversight and unelected regulators.\n\n\u201cWhat prevents the man of tomorrow from even greater servitude? We do . . . we are building the economic defence of modern society against plunder and restriction by the state, we are saying no to the perpetual encroachment of permissioned existence,\u201d Voorhees added.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan, author, investor and former chief technology officer at Coinbase, launched the Network State conference last month in Amsterdam in a bid to \u201cbuild the parallel establishment\u201d.\n\nSpeakers including Vitalik Buterin and Anatoly Yakovenko \u2014 the minds behind the popular ethereum and solana crypto blockchains, respectively \u2014 and the Winklevoss twins \u2014 who founded the Gemini crypto exchange \u2014 all attended.\n\n\u201cThis is a meeting of all the people building the parallel establishment. That\u2019s more than parallel money. It\u2019s parallel media, parallel education, parallel science, parallel construction, even parallel cities,\u201d Srinivasan said.\n\nAfter the scandalous demise of crypto\u2019s former poster boy, the decision to retreat from a losing battle with lawmakers and regulators may be tempting, but it is a decision that risks undermining a market that is already thinly traded.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan, former chief technology officer at Coinbase, and other crypto pioneers are pushing against government regulation \u00a9 FT montage/Bloomberg\n\nAt the start of 2023, it would have required the purchase of more than 1,400 bitcoins \u2014 about $23mn at the time \u2014 to move the price of the token by more than one per cent, according to numbers shared by data provider CCData.\n\nBut by the end of April, it would have taken only 462 bitcoins \u2014 then worth about $13mn \u2014 to achieve the same market movement. This was the lowest point of market depth for bitcoin and tether, the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, since May 2022 when the sector plunged into chaos.\n\nToday\u2019s numbers have improved, but still do not portray a widely traded market with retail momentum and fresh money coming in; it would now take 752 bitcoins, worth about $26mn, to move the price of the coin.\n\n\u201cBankman-Fried\u2019s guilty verdict has been priced in for a long time, in my view,\u201d says Solot, of Marex.\n\n\u201cBut hypothetically, if this proved to be the major fork in the road where crypto adoption slowed down or even failed, the risk . . . is that you would only have internal money sloshing around in the market, and it basically atrophies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere would be no new money, there would be no growth.\u201d\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nWhere cryptocurrencies resemble Ponzi schemes / From Jean Jacques Chenier, Paris, France"

It filmed a Super Bowl advertisement with actor and producer Larry David.\n\nA giant screen shows Sam Bankman-Fried at a cryptocurrency conference in the Bahamas \u00a9 FT montage\n\nBut on November 2, a 12-person New York jury needed less than five hours to reach unanimous agreement that Bankman-Fried was guilty of seven charges.\n\n\u201cSam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d said US attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams. \u201cThis kind of fraud, this kind of corruption is as old as time, and we have no patience for it.\u201d\n\nAs crypto\u2019s former leading light contemplates a possible lengthy jail sentence, the industry he championed could go one of two ways: either it collectively regroups and tries \u2014 all over again \u2014 to be accepted in the world of mainstream finance, or it falls back on its longstanding image as a niche market for speculators, day traders and those who fervently believe money should remain separate from the state.\n\nFor John Reed Stark, former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s office of internet enforcement, the trial verdict is \u201ca death knell for crypto, Web 3 and blockchain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an industry that has run its course,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it all went away tomorrow, it wouldn\u2019t impact a single person on the planet other than the speculator.\u201d\n\nBut others believe the industry can recover from the debacle of the Bankman-Fried trial and become a part of mainstream finance.\n\n\u201cCrypto\u2019s public image is at an all-time low, but the industry isn\u2019t done yet,\u201d says Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto futures index platform Phuture.\n\nAn inglorious history\n\nThe ignominious conclusion of Bankman-Fried\u2019s career follows more than a decade of non-compliance with traditional financial rules, run-ins with regulators around the world, and accusations that cryptocurrencies are used to fund terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the computing power needed to \u201cmine\u201d crypto assets like bitcoin generates a carbon footprint roughly equivalent to a country the size of Ukraine.\n\nFTX\u2019s bankruptcy in 2022 capped off a crisis of confidence that resulted in popular digital assets such as bitcoin and ether losing more than half their value. Other once prominent firms like Terraform Labs and Three Arrows Capital also collapsed.\n\nIn response, lawmakers and regulators in multiple jurisdictions stepped up their oversight of the sector to unprecedented levels during 2023. US regulators have issued a blitz of enforcement cases and lawsuits against some of the biggest crypto companies still standing. They include US-listed Coinbase \u2014 which is facing an SEC lawsuit after allegedly violating securities laws \u2014 and Binance, FTX\u2019s great rival and the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by some distance.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance in March, alleging it had illegally accessed US customers and that it knew it facilitated potentially illegal activities.\n\nBinance is now the biggest crypto exchange but the company and its chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, face regulatory action from both the CFTC and SEC \u00a9 FT montage/Reuters\n\nThree months later, the SEC filed a lawsuit of its own against Binance, alleging that it had mixed customers\u2019 cash with a separate trading firm owned by its chief executive Changpeng Zhao. Both Binance and Coinbase have denied the allegations and said they will fight their respective lawsuits.\n\nIn the wake of the October 7 atrocities, Israeli law enforcement authorities closed more than 100 Binance accounts and identified about 150 crypto donation initiatives affiliated with Hamas, prompting renewed allegations about the industry\u2019s ties to financing terrorism and fresh calls for a crackdown.\n\n\u201cThis industry came to prominence after the failure of Mt Gox and the controversy of Silk Road,\u201d says Charley Cooper, a former chief of staff at the CFTC. \u201cThroughout its history, it has had multiple scandals \u2014 as a far greater proportion of their market \u2014 than any other industry has had.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of doctors are not defrauding the healthcare system, the majority of lawyers are not violating court ethics. The Wall Street guys, you can call them greedy, but they\u2019re not breaking the law,\u201d Cooper adds.\n\nYesha Yadav, professor of law at Vanderbilt Law School, describes Bankman-Fried\u2019s conviction as \u201ca monumentally important moment\u201d for the wider crypto sector. \u201cThat the jury came back so decisively really highlights how far and how deeply a key symbol of the industry had fallen . . . it\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger reputational hit.\u201d\n\nThose working in the industry are concerned that their career prospects could be damaged as a result. One professional who contacted the Financial Times says he is \u201ca little concerned with how being affiliated with crypto could be perceived for recruiting for traditional industries.\u201d\n\nHe has lost money with FTX as well as Voyager, another crypto company that collapsed last year. \u201cThe experience has made me a lot more conservative,\u201d he adds.\n\nCrypto glasnost\n\nAfter FTX filed for bankruptcy last November, influential voices in the sector called for a renewed focus on transparency.\n\nBinance\u2019s Zhao said \u201call crypto exchanges\u201d should provide proof of reserves and committed his own business to \u201cfull transparency\u201d. Days later, rival exchange OKX said it was launching its first proof of reserves \u201cto set a new standard of transparency, risk management and user protection\u201d.\n\nBut according to figures from industry data provider CCData, only about a third of crypto exchanges currently offer proof of reserves or alternatives, such as regularly audited financial statements.\n\nThose exchanges that have offered some form of financial transparency to their customers account for about 81 per cent of the market, but that is down from 86 per cent in March \u2014 and about the level it was in November 2022, when FTX went bust.\n\nAccording to Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, this suggests that \u201cproof of reserves might have become less discerning to users compared to the early months after the collapse of FTX\u201d.\n\nJames Newman, co-head of perfORM Due Diligence Services Limited, says the largest and most influential of exchanges \u201chave taken steps to bring additional transparency over the assets they hold\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are many that have been slow in adopting proof of reserves,\u201d he adds, saying it is \u201clikely symptomatic of the continued dominance of retail money held on exchanges who do not speak as one voice\u201d.\n\nRetail traders \u2014 individuals trading for themselves \u2014 have been instrumental in the sector\u2019s growth. But many feel it now needs to widen its appeal. \u201cCrypto\u2019s survival relies on external support and belief from other industries,\u201d says Storry. \u201cRetail is on board, but we now need institutional backing to take the industry to the next level.\u201d\n\nThere are signs this is happening. In the summer, payments giant PayPal became the first major financial institution to launch a US dollar-pegged crypto token. The company has offered trading in the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrencies since 2020, but the launch of a so-called stablecoin \u2014 a crypto asset whose price tracks that of a more recognised asset, often a conventional currency \u2014 marked a major boon for a troubled sector.\n\nEven greater hopes for institutional backing rest on BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, gaining SEC approval to launch a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund. That would allow investors to speculate on bitcoin within a regulated financial vehicle run by a recognised name.\n\nLast month, as speculation grew over BlackRock\u2019s application possibly being approved, bitcoin\u2019s price surged to $35,000, erasing all the losses it had racked up since the crypto market crisis began in May 2022.\n\nRegulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission under Gary Gensler, have been wrestling with how to regulate crypto asset trading \u00a9 FT montage/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cThere are signs of entry into this industry if you know where to look: we are talking about BlackRock launching a bitcoin exchange traded fund and PayPal launching a dollar-pegged stablecoin,\u201d says Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at financial services firm Marex.\n\nBut nothing is set in stone. The SEC, led by chair Gary Gensler, has so far resisted approving any such applications and may never give BlackRock \u2014 or any other candidate \u2014 the green light to take bitcoin to the mass market.\n\nLawmakers have also turned more circumspect. Last month, Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative French Hill urged the Department of Justice to consider criminal charges against Binance and Tether, the largest trading exchange and the largest stablecoin issuer, respectively.\n\nFollowing Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel, more than 100 lawmakers from both major political parties in the US signed a letter urging the Biden administration to outline the steps it is taking to mitigate cryptocurrencies being used as a means of financing terrorism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder to get legislation passed in the US, and there will now be a colder reception in Congress,\u201d says one crypto industry lobbyist in Washington. It remains to be seen in 2024, whether Coinbase and Binance are as willing \u2014 or even as able \u2014 to lobby regulators and politicians as FTX once was.\n\nBack to first principles\n\nThe irony of crypto\u2019s push for respectability is not lost on Reed Stark, the ex-SEC executive. \u201cAll of these crypto guys are now crying out for a bitcoin ETF, but started the bitcoin project because they were upset about the 2008 banking crisis. They were upset about the government being able to surveil their financial transactions,\u201d he points out.\n\n\u201cSo what do they do? They rally around one of the biggest financial services companies in the world because there\u2019s nothing left. It\u2019s the ultimate hypocrisy,\u201d he adds.\n\nCustomers protesting outside the offices of Mt Gox\u2019s operator in Tokyo in 2014. The failure of the exchange presaged many of crypto\u2019s current problems \u00a9 FT montage/Bloomberg\n\nBut while many in the industry have pinned their hopes on a mainstream future, another branch would prefer crypto to go back to its roots.\n\nErik Voorhees, founder of crypto platform ShapeShift and an unabashed libertarian, last month issued a rallying cry to those still faithful to the original crypto cause.\n\n\u201cWhy do we accept this world in which we are free to transact only on the conditional approval of strangers?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis of course is not freedom. It is subservience, it is serfdom, and that the chains bear lightly down in most cases should not lull us into forgetting that the chains exist.\u201d\n\nInstead of walking head first into an increasingly hostile crowd of regulators and lawmakers, Voorhees and others like him are pushing for the industry to go back to first principles: permissionless finance that stands as an explicit rejection of the establishment, government oversight and unelected regulators.\n\n\u201cWhat prevents the man of tomorrow from even greater servitude? We do . . . we are building the economic defence of modern society against plunder and restriction by the state, we are saying no to the perpetual encroachment of permissioned existence,\u201d Voorhees added.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan, author, investor and former chief technology officer at Coinbase, launched the Network State conference last month in Amsterdam in a bid to \u201cbuild the parallel establishment\u201d.\n\nSpeakers including Vitalik Buterin and Anatoly Yakovenko \u2014 the minds behind the popular ethereum and solana crypto blockchains, respectively \u2014 and the Winklevoss twins \u2014 who founded the Gemini crypto exchange \u2014 all attended.\n\n\u201cThis is a meeting of all the people building the parallel establishment. That\u2019s more than parallel money. It\u2019s parallel media, parallel education, parallel science, parallel construction, even parallel cities,\u201d Srinivasan said.\n\nAfter the scandalous demise of crypto\u2019s former poster boy, the decision to retreat from a losing battle with lawmakers and regulators may be tempting, but it is a decision that risks undermining a market that is already thinly traded.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan, former chief technology officer at Coinbase, and other crypto pioneers are pushing against government regulation \u00a9 FT montage/Bloomberg\n\nAt the start of 2023, it would have required the purchase of more than 1,400 bitcoins \u2014 about $23mn at the time \u2014 to move the price of the token by more than one per cent, according to numbers shared by data provider CCData.\n\nBut by the end of April, it would have taken only 462 bitcoins \u2014 then worth about $13mn \u2014 to achieve the same market movement. This was the lowest point of market depth for bitcoin and tether, the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, since May 2022 when the sector plunged into chaos.\n\nToday\u2019s numbers have improved, but still do not portray a widely traded market with retail momentum and fresh money coming in; it would now take 752 bitcoins, worth about $26mn, to move the price of the coin.\n\n\u201cBankman-Fried\u2019s guilty verdict has been priced in for a long time, in my view,\u201d says Solot, of Marex.\n\n\u201cBut hypothetically, if this proved to be the major fork in the road where crypto adoption slowed down or even failed, the risk . . . is that you would only have internal money sloshing around in the market, and it basically atrophies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere would be no new money, there would be no growth.\u201d\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nWhere cryptocurrencies resemble Ponzi schemes / From Jean Jacques Chenier, Paris, France"
