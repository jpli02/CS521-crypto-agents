        "content": "A digital token launched 12 years ago as a more transaction-friendly version of Bitcoin is drawing the attention of speculators after a meme-token frenzy drove up costs on the largest blockchain.\n\nLitecoin has rallied almost 20% since May 8, when fees on Bitcoin reached a high of $30 per transaction, compared with a decline in an index of cryptocurrencies. The surge in Bitcoin fees has also driven transactions on the Litecoin blockchain to a record as users sought a cheaper alternative \u2014 without spawning a similar jump in costs."

        "content": "Tether Holdings Ltd., the operator of the largest stablecoin, will invest as much as 15% of profits on a regular basis in Bitcoin as part of a strategy to diversify its reserves.\n\nStarting this month, all Bitcoin purchased will be considered as additional holdings on top of the minimum assets kept in reserve to back its USDT token and other stablecoins, the British Virgin Islands-based firm said in a statement. Stablecoins are digital tokens that aim to keep a one-to-one value with a less volatile asset like the dollar, typically by maintaining large reserves as segregated collateral."

        "content": "While bitcoin and ether were flat on Wednesday, altcoins rose higher.\n\nLitecoin rose 5.67% and XRP added 6%, according to Coin Metrics. The Sandbox token jumped 4%. The price of the Axie Infinity token added about 8%.\n\nAmong the Ethereum competitors, the Solana token gained 2%, Cardano's ada added 3.5% and the Polkadot token jumped 3%.\n\nOn Wednesday Ripple, the global payments company behind XRP, announced its acquisition of Metaco, a Swiss crypto custody services firm. The deal is expected to give Ripple access to clients like Citi and BNP Paribas and expand its overseas presence.\n\nCrypto price action has been relatively subdued for the past month, despite volatility coming back a bit recently due to thin liquidity in the market. Still, realized 30-day volatility for both bitcoin and ether are off their record lows of the year, according to Glassnode.\n\nWith that, some investors have shifted their attention away from bitcoin and toward smaller and newer tokens, or \"altcoins.\" This is a recurring period in the bitcoin cycle known as \"altcoin season.\" In recent months, bitcoin and ether have been regarded by many as so-called \"blue chip\" or \"flight to safety\" assets in crypto.\n\n\"Like macro markets, juggling resilient stock prices with increasingly bleak economic data points, the crypto market is also dealing with duality. There are some signs of frothiness,\" said Noelle Acheson, author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter.\n\nSpecifically, earlier this month ether briefly rallied and the Bitcoin blockchain saw a record high in daily transactions amid a surge in interest around memecoins and NFT-like tokens on the Bitcoin network called ordinals.\n\n\"In spite of these hints of froth, activity is low,\" Acheson added. \"Prices are down more than 10% on the month, and volumes are trending lower.\"\n\nBitcoin and ether continued to hover around the flat line Wednesday at the $27,000 and $1,800 levels, respectively."

        "content": "A picture taken in London shows gold-plated souvenir cryptocurrency tether, bitcoin and ethereum coins arranged beside a screen displaying a trading chart, May 8, 2022.\n\nCryptocurrency giant Tether on Wednesday said that it's going to purchase hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin to back the world's largest stablecoin.\n\nThe company said it would invest 15% of its net profit into bitcoin to \"diversify\" the reserves that back its USDT token, which aims to stick to a 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThat would amount to roughly $222 million, based on the company's last attestation report, which provides a breakdown of the assets that make up its USDT reserves as well as excess reserves and profits.\n\nA Tether spokesperson clarified the bitcoin it purchases would amount to only a small portion of its overall net profit, with the bulk of excess income being spent on running the business, including bank fees.\n\n\"The aim is to keep the Bitcoin portfolio value well below the size of our total excess reserves that accounted for 2.48B at the end of Q1/2023, while bitcoin holdings accounted for 1.5B,\" the Tether spokesperson said.\n\nUSDT is the largest stablecoin in the market, with a circulating supply of more than $82.8 billion, according to CoinGecko data. It competes with Circle's USD Coin and Binance's BUSD.\n\nStablecoins are used by traders to move in and out of different cryptocurrencies without converting money back into fiat currencies.\n\n\"The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset,\" Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement.\n\n\"Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned Bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike.\"\n\nThe move would make Tether an even bigger holder of bitcoin \u2014 the firm already holds over $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 and follows moves from notable investors like Paul Tudor Jones and MicroStrategy boss Michael Saylor to accumulate huge stockpiles, in the belief that the token is immune to the effects of currency depreciation and inflation.\n\nAnalysts and investors have previously told CNBC that bitcoin could get a boost this year due to the influence of so-called \"whales\" \u2014 market players with significant financial firepower, which enables them to buy up huge sums of tokens.\n\nTether's methods to maintain a $1 value for its token have drawn controversy in the past because of concerns over the quality of its reserve assets. Previously, the company held a great deal of its reserves in commercial paper \u2014 a form of short-term, unsecured debt issued by companies. This is seen as less safer than other forms of debt, such as U.S. Treasury bills.\n\nTether sought to allay investor fears by rotating out of commercial paper and replacing these fund holdings with only U.S. government debt securities.\n\nIn February, the company said it had whittled down its commercial paper holdings to zero.\n\nUSDT and its issuer remain a source of contention in the crypto market. The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly investigating executives at Tether over possible bank fraud.\n\nStablecoins were already a hot-button issue for regulators, who have been scrambling to figure out how to keep the industry in check after the demise of several notable firms in the space."
