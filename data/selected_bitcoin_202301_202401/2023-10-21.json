        "content": "The US government has seized at least $5.5 billion worth of bitcoin since 2020, according to analysts.\n\nIts stake makes it one of the world's largest crypto \"whales\".\n\nWhether it holds or sells its bitcoin stash could have a huge impact on the token's price.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.
