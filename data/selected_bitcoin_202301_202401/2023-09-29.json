        "title": "Quarterly Investment Guide 4Q 2023: Bitcoin outlook - CNBC",
        "content": "Patient bitcoin investors may have to hold their composure for at least another quarter as the Federal Reserve's outlook on interest rate policy dampens what might have been an even stronger month for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has had a difficult but decent year so far. The flagship cryptocurrency is up more than 60% for the year, according to Coin Metrics, thanks to a big run up in the first quarter. Not much has happened since, however. Bitcoin is down about 5% since April 1, and subsequent gains from any of several positive developments in the industry this year \u2013 like Ripple's win in the SEC's lawsuit against it, Grayscale's victory in its SEC suit, and several financial giants putting their names in the hat for a bitcoin ETF \u2013 have failed to hold. In the final quarter of the year, bitcoin is likely to see continued chop and although there's room for some upside, it may be limited. \"If we have positive ETF developments, I could see us going back to the top of the range that we saw this year,\" said Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data provider Amberdata. Bitcoin has traded in a narrow range of between $25,000 and $30,000 since about March. A bitcoin ETF getting the green light is widely regarded as a key event that would push bitcoin to a new high and bring liquidity and trading volumes back into crypto. Read more from CNBC Pro's Quarterly Investment Guide Wall Street sees the market's bumpy ride continuing in the 4th quarter. Here are the risks in store Danger, 'pothole' ahead: Economic growth slowing to a near-halt to end the year Oil prices and the dollar surged in the third quarter. These ETFs can help you reset your portfolio After a rough third quarter, here's what to expect from technology stocks into the end of 2023 These underperforming stocks are due for a fourth-quarter comeback, according to Wall Street Supply cuts from Saudi Arabia remain price drivers for oil heading into the fourth quarter \"One of the big problems with us breaking out into new high territories is we still have this backdrop of a hawkish Fed that's dragging on risk assets across the board,\" he added. \"A crypto-specific catalyst could bring us up to the top of that range, but the macro is still a headwind. That probably prevents us from breaking to new highs on the year.\" Last week, at the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting, the central bank hit pause on rate hikes but indicated it could hold rates at higher levels for longer than previously thought. Rob Ginsberg, a chart analyst at Wolfe Research, said he wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoin break below $25,000, a key support level for the cryptocurrency, when rates break out to new cycle highs. When the Fed pivots on rate hikes, investors could expect a \"violent\" rotation back into risk , he said. Still, bitcoin is currently on pace to end September, typically its worst month of the year, up more than 3%. That would mark its first positive month in the quarter. Typically, it has ended the month in the red in eight of the last 10 years, according to CoinGlass. Despite this, it remains on pace for an 11% decline in the third quarter, historically a weaker quarter for the cryptocurrency. That would make it its sixth third-quarter loss in 11 years. Bitcoin is entering a historically upbeat period. The cryptocurrency has posted a monthly gain in eight out of the last 10 Octobers and a fourth-quarter gain in six of the last 10 years. Blame it on interest rates In a year when the Fed has continued to raise rates \u2013 and following a year when its rate hiking drove much of bitcoin's price \u2013 inflation data and monetary policy haven't been big drivers for bitcoin the way industry-specific catalysts have been. That influence may be back in play in Q4, however, after it hinted at higher rates for longer last week. \"The Fed has put markets and the economy in conservation mode by forcing investors to make hard choices with their money, and it reminded us last week that they may not switch back to innovation mode any time soon,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investment company eToro. \"People are more concerned about protecting their portfolios than taking a shot at the next, hot thing in crypto. That's weighed on trading volumes, liquidity and speculation within the industry.\" With bitcoin as the digital gold play for investors and ether as the crypto tech play, higher rates could continue to weigh more heavily on ether, which is up about half as much as bitcoin in 2023 and on pace to post a more than 13% loss for the quarter. Meanwhile, holding a non-yielding asset like gold or bitcoin could become \"less interesting\" as rates go higher, Amberdata's Magadini said. BTC.CM= ETH.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin's biggest gains may be in for the year, but there's still some room for more limited upside in Q4. But that could be good for bitcoin, which is sitting in the middle of a shift from speculative to quality investments, according to Cox. While bitcoin as a risky investment to traditional-minded investors lining it up against stocks and bonds, for the crypto-focused investor, bitcoin is a relatively stable store of value and a hedge against the traditional financial system, which has shown cracks this year that supported that narrative. There's a significant crowd on both sides, Cox said \u2013 \"that's why bitcoin is up 60% in a year when the Fed has hiked interest rates so aggressively.\" \"Bitcoin is at levels where it could struggle technically, but in a weird way, you may continue to see money flow into well-known cryptocurrencies because of the focus on quality,\" said Cox. \"That's the story of the fourth quarter: how does the appetite for quality collide with the appetite for speculation? The answer to that depends on interest rates, which will probably stay high.\""

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs Will Move the Needle for Institutional Adoption of Digital Assets in the U.S. - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have already witnessed tremendous growth, and now there\u2019s an increasing number of solid applications to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs by some of the largest traditional financial institutions.\n\nBy taking those two factors into account, along with Grayscale's recent court battle win and Franklin Templeton's spot Bitcoin ETF application, it seems that it\u2019s a matter of when spot Bitcoin ETFs will be available to investors rather than if this will happen.\n\nWhen they\u2019re available, they will help to streamline and facilitate mainstream institutional adoption of digital assets in the United States.\n\nETF Growth in the United States and World\n\nETFs can be a logical choice for investors: cost-efficient and easily accessible. As a quick overview, total U.S. ETF net assets under management (AUM) have exploded from $102B in 2002 to $6.44T in 2022.\n\nProjected growth hasn\u2019t stagnated, either. According to BlackRock\u2014which shows a global total of $10T USD in ETFs in 2022\u2014this financial product could reach $14T in value, worldwide, by the end of 2024.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are a natural progression in this financial product.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nAlthough debate still exists about whether a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States would create a pathway to mainstream crypto adoption, many people in the digital asset world are increasingly optimistic\u2014both about the potential for approval and its impact.\n\nWe believe this approval will help to bring fresh capital into the market through demand for the product. Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow people to directly invest in Bitcoin in simplified ways. Investments are based on current market prices with the owners holding the crypto like they would a stock within the fund, which would make it feel familiar to people who are used to investing but new to crypto.\n\nThese opportunities already exist in Canada and are launching in Europe; currently, though, eyes are on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the spot Bitcoin ETF application from BlackRock\u2014which was quickly followed up by applications from additional traditional finance mainstays; the following have filed for a Nasdaq spot Bitcoin ETF listing: Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and Bitwise.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo date, the SEC has not approved any spot Bitcoin ETF applications, citing market manipulation of Bitcoin prices as the primary reason for most rejections. BlackRock\u2019s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust application, though, contains an element that may cause the SEC to agree to the fund\u2019s creation: a proposed surveillance-sharing agreement with Nasdaq and a large U.S. digital asset exchange that will serve as a barrier against market manipulation.\n\nThis surveillance-sharing agreement would provide transparency in market trading and clearing activities as well as customer identification. Plus, if this approach meets the SEC\u2019s approval, it would serve as a guidebook for other companies to follow.\n\nOnce these spot ETFs are available, providing ease of investing in Bitcoin, it will naturally lead to more institutional flows of funds\u2014especially as the number of distribution sources increases. Because Bitcoin supply is limited to 21MM, this capped availability could provide a positive price action as increasing numbers of institutional investors have more seamless access to the coins.\n\nBecause the likelihood of SEC approval seems high, several major asset managers have recently applied to offer Ethereum ETFs: Van Eck, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, Roundhill, and Proshares.\n\nHedge Funds Increasing Exposure to Digital Assets\n\nOn a related topic, \u201cRebuilding confidence in crypto: 5th Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report (2023)\u201d notes how traditional hedge funds have continued to look at increasing their digital asset exposure despite the volatile 2022 environment.\n\nMore than half of the traditional hedge funds currently investing in crypto-assets intend to maintain the same levels of capital deployed this year while nearly half (46 percent) intend to deploy more capital into this asset class by the end of 2023. Notably, none of the respondents said they planned to reduce their exposure.\n\nCrypto curiosity has edged up among those funds not yet investing in crypto-assets. More than one-third (37 percent) of survey respondents confirm that they\u2019re simply waiting for further maturity before investing\u2014with more than two-thirds (69 percent) of the curious survey participants being hedge funds managing over a billion dollars.\n\nOptimism about the future reigns: 93 percent of crypto hedge funds expect crypto-asset market capitalization to be higher at the end of 2023 than it was at the end of 2022.\n\nAs for the investors in crypto hedge funds, they want the following: mandatory asset segregation; mandatory financial audits; independent statements of reserve assets; and platform security. To further build confidence with these investors, the hedge fund industry is increasing their use of standard liquidity management tools and enhancing their counterparty risk management policies. They\u2019re focusing on optimal custody solutions, and use for third-party custodians is strong with 80 percent of crypto and traditional hedge funds selecting this as their primary custody route.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s proposed rule on qualified custodians would further regulations in that direction, appropriately segregating assets and otherwise protecting investors\u2014which meshes with what the hedge fund industry and its investors desire in risk management.\n\nETFs Offer the Best Avenue to Traditional Financial Adoption Today\n\nSpot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs available through trusted traditional financial institutions will break down barriers and streamline mainstream adoption, helping investors navigate a crypto ecosystem that might seem complex and feel intimidating.\n\nOnce available through familiar traditional financial institutions, the process will feel more comfortable and welcoming. Some investors may limit digital asset exposure to ETFs while others may ultimately expand beyond that into the broader world of crypto investing. Traditional asset managers increasing allocations to digital assets will also help to drive mainstream adoption going forward.\n\nAdam Sporn is BitGo\u2019s Head of Prime Brokerage and US Institutional Sales.\n\nRead the original post on The Defiant"
