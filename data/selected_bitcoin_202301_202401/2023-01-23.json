        "title": "Congo's Oldest National Park Bets on Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nIn Congo\u2019s Virunga National Park, compounding issues from the pandemic and violent conflict have had a dramatic impact on tourism, leading park administrators to turn toward green-energy-based Bitcoin mining.\n\nVirunga National Park has had a storied history since its founding in 1925. The oldest national park in The Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is arguably one of the oldest in Africa, especially considering that older parks were established with titles like \u201cGame Preserve No. 3.\u201d Having once been the largest park in the Congo, it sits on the border with two other countries, and has since split between them. The largest piece, however, remains in the Congo, where it is home to thousands of endangered species, including a gorilla that only exists in the park. And it is in trouble.\n\nA series of significant problems has led to park authorities\u2019 decision to begin bitcoin mining in the national park. The park\u2019s status on the border between three nations has engulfed it in various humanitarian crises, like the Congo Wars and the Rwandan Genocide. Although refugees can certainly disrupt endangered habitats, the real danger has come from the fighters. Armed militias from these conflicts can come to poach timber and animals, extract oil, even set up permanent bases and more. And while these threats are bad enough to discourage visitation, the global COVID-19 pandemic further hurt tourism revenues, wiping out 40% of park revenue.\n\nIt is for these reasons that park director Emmanuel de Merode has pursued a radical solution: using park facilities to mine Bitcoin. Three hydroelectric dams exist within the park, which can readily convert excess electricity into bitcoin with zero carbon emissions. The operation began in late 2020, and now includes thousands of mining rigs. Some 70% are owned by Big Block Green Services, which has partnered with the park and purchases electricity, while the other 30% are owned directly by the park itself. De Merode seemed unconcerned about market fluctuation, claiming that, \u201cWe\u2019re not speculating on its value; we\u2019re generating it. If you buy bitcoin and it decreases, you lose money. We\u2019re making bitcoin out of surplus energy and monetizing something that otherwise has no value. That\u2019s a big difference.\u201d\n\nThis radical solution is right at home in a climate of growing Bitcoin adoption in Africa. As international Bitcoin conferences take off, major developers worldwide are already planning to build the infrastructure that can meet growing demand. Virunga turning to decentralized cryptocurrency is just another example of how well Bitcoin can penetrate into new markets, and how its use-cases beyond pure speculation to power a strong community. Although Virunga National Park is facing real dangers near its 100-year anniversary, Bitcoin can show it a bright future for 100 more.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nThomas Trutschel | Photothek | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin continued its climb Monday as traders took news of another crypto bankruptcy in their stride and placed bets on a Federal Reserve \"pivot\" to cutting interest rates. The price of the No. 1 token briefly topped $23,100 Monday, after touching $23,333.83 Saturday for the first time since Aug. 19, according to Coin Metrics. The jump brings bitcoin up almost 39% since the start of January. Ether , the second-biggest digital coin, rallied as high as $1,664.78 on Saturday. That's the first time it has surpassed $1,600 since Nov. 7, 2022. It was last trading at $1,637.40 apiece. Bitcoin has kicked off 2023 on a positive note, with investors hoping for a reversal in the monetary tightening that spooked market players last year. The Fed and other central banks began cutting interest rates in 2022, shocking holders of risky asset classes, like stocks and digital tokens. Publicly-listed tech stocks and private venture capital-backed start-ups particularly took a beating, as investors sought protection in assets perceived as safer, such as cash and bonds.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon A chart showing bitcoin's year-to-date price performance; the digital currency has climbed nearly 39% since the start of January.\n\nWith inflation now showing signs of cooling in the U.S., some market players are hopeful that central banks will start easing the pace of rate rises, or even slash rates. Economists previously told CNBC they predict a Fed rate cut could happen as soon as this year. \"Fed tightening seems to be lighter and inflation less of a risk,\" Charles Hayter, CEO of crypto data site CryptoCompare, said in emailed comments to CNBC. \"There is hope there will be more caution to rate rises globally.\" The Fed is likely to keep interest rates high for the time being. However, some officials at the bank have recently called for a reduction in the size of quarterly rate hikes, wary of a slowdown in economic activity. The world's top digital currency, bitcoin, is \"increasingly looking like it has put in its bottom,\" according to Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno. Bitcoin short sellers have been squeezed by sudden upward moves in prices, according to Ayyar. Short selling is an investment strategy whereby traders borrow an asset and then sell it in the hope that it will depreciate in value. A wipe-out of those short positions sparked by the rising price of bitcoin has added \"fuel to the fire,\" Ayyar said, as short sellers are forced to cover their bets by buying back the borrowed bitcoin to close them out.\n\nWhat crypto collapse?\n\nInvestors don't seem to have been greatly perturbed by the collapses of top crypto companies, stemming from the fallout of digital currency exchange FTX's insolvency in November.\n\nLast week, the lending arm of New York-based crypto investment firm Genesis became the latest casualty of the crypto crisis, seeking bankruptcy protection in a \"mega\" filing listing aggregate liabilities ranging from $1.2 billion to $11 billion. \"The Genesis debacle has been playing out for a while and is likely priced in already. FTX, on the other hand, has already had a significant impact on many investors, on market psychology and on the prices of several toxic assets,\" Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of crypto investment advisory firm Quantum Economics, told CNBC. \"It should be noted however that the price on bitcoin itself is quite limited since FTX didn't have any on their balance sheets.\" Bitcoin is still about 67% off its all-time high, despite its recent surge. The latest crypto plunge is different from past cycles, in large part due to the role played by leverage. Major crypto players became entangled in risky lending practices, offering lofty yields that many investors now say were unsustainable. This began in May with the collapse of terraUSD \u2014 or UST \u2014 an algorithmic stablecoin that was supposed to be pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. The failure of UST brought down terraUSD's sister token luna and hit companies with exposure to both tokens. Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund with bullish views on crypto, plunged into liquidation because of its exposure to terraUSD. Then came the November collapse of FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It was run by Sam Bankman-Fried, an executive who was often in the spotlight. The fallout from FTX continues to ripple across the cryptocurrency industry. Roughly $2 trillion of value has been erased from the overall crypto market since the peak of the crypto boom in November 2021, in a deep downturn known as \"crypto winter.\"\n\nwatch now"
