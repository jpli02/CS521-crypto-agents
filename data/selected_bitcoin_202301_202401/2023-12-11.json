        "content": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year.\n\nBitcoin fell Monday as investors took profits after its December rally.\n\nThe price of the cryptocurrency was recently lower by more than 7% at $40,887.81, according to Coinbase, after a big drop Sunday night that at one point took it as low as $40,300. Bitcoin topped $44,000 last week and traded just below that level throughout the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, ether fell 7% Monday to $2,202.92. Solana's SOL token was down 7% as well while Ripple's XRP fell about 8%. According to Coin Metrics, bitcoin and ether are on pace for their worst days since Aug. 18 and March 9, respectively.\n\nCrypto equities were dragged down, too. Coinbase fell about 5%, while MicroStrategy lost 7%. Bitcoin miners dropped double digits, with Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital , the largest mining stocks, lower by 11% and 12%, respectively. Wall Street favorites CleanSpark and Iris Energy were down nearly 15% and 14%, respectively.\n\nThe moves come after a 12% advance for bitcoin in December, according to Coin Metrics, as expectations grew that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could approve the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in early January. Galaxy Digital estimates the addressable market size of a U.S. bitcoin ETF to be about $14 trillion in the first year after a launch, growing to about $26 trillion in the second year."

        "content": "Bitcoin\n\nAs excitement builds among investors that a much-anticipated first spot bitcoin ETF could launch early next year, firms are disclosing the tickers for their funds as they prepare for fierce marketing competition if the exchange-traded funds are approved.\n\nVanEck included the firm\u2019s meme reference ticker HODL in their most recent amendment filed Dec. 8 to the firm\u2019s S-1 filing, while Fidelity Investments\u2019 ticker, FBTC, appeared on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. website on Dec. 7.\n\nVanEck\u2019s ticker, HODL, is likely a nod to a popular cryptocurrency term often used to mean \u201cHold On For Dear Life.\u201d Eric Balchunas noted on X that HODL was differentiated from tickers from BlackRock Inc., Invesco and Fidelity as a \u201cdeparture from the more boring Boomer-y choices.\u201d BlackRock\u2019s proposed ticker is IBTC, and Invesco\u2019s is BTCO.\n\nWhile having a catchy or entertaining ticker could speak directly to crypto retail investors, it doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that investors would be won over by a pertinent reference or pun.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to say how much impact a ticker has on the demand for an ETF,\u201d said etf.com senior analyst Sumit Roy. \u201cA good ticker could make a fund more memorable (i.e. \"HACK\" for a cybersecurity ETF), but it only plays a tiny part in an ETF's success.\u201d\n\nMany ETFs with memorable tickers have also failed to gain traction. For example, Roundhill Investments recently announced it was shuttering its Roundhill MEME ETF (MEME) after the fund failed to gain traction with its targeted audience of retail traders.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nFees, liquidity and brand recognition will be key factors that investors will use to differentiate funds, according to both fund issuers and analysts.\n\nIn an interview with etf.com in November, Cathie Wood, who operates spot bitcoin ETF hopeful issuer ARK Invest, said that if multiple spot bitcoin ETFs are launched at the same time, firms will jockey to win over both institutional and retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt's a marketing game from there, although some people would call it a war,\u201d Wood said.\n\nThat issuers are updating their tickers is also a sign that firms are in the final stages of amending their applications. The ETF issuers who have been in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission have narrowed down the agency\u2019s concerns to a few key details, according to Reuters.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrency Platforms That Could Outperform Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Amid the rally in the cryptocurrency market, now is the time to consider some cryptos that are better than Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Although BTC may never be usurped from its throne as the king of decentralized currencies, it may not be as flexible or robust as others in specific situations. Furthermore, diversifying one\u2019s portfolio with different coins may lead to stronger gains overall.\n\nSo, in this article, we\u2019ll discuss three cryptos that are better than Bitcoin. That way, you can unlock more value from your portfolio and expose yourself to different segments of the market.\n\nHere are three coins for you to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nConcept graphic of Ethereum Classic (ETC) crypto logo in green techno style\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/BT Side\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) wins over Bitcoin due to better ecosystem support and more efficient use of energy through proof-of-stake.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may be monolithic, Ethereum is comparatively more diverse due to the community\u2019s ability to host and scale decentralized applications on its platforms and allow investors to stake their Ethereum-based tokens for strong APY returns.\n\nWhat\u2019s better is that while the market is focused on a proposed Bitcoin ETF, there\u2019s also an Ether ETF proposal in the making. Companies like Fidelity National Financial (NYSE:FNF) have submitted applications for an ETF over the past few years, and more are expected to be lodged in the future. That would give retail investors and institutions direct exposure to ETH without owning the underlying, offloading custody risk and making it generally more accessible overall.\n\nThat makes ETH one of those cryptos that are better than Bitcoin.\n\nCardano (ADA-USD)\n\nA concept coin for Cardano (ADA). Cardano Price Predictions\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCardano (ADA-USD) stands out for its research-driven approach to blockchain development with its Ouroboros network. Although ADA also uses proof-of-work, its architecture is designed to be less energy-intensive than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nADA stands out as a pick because if history repeats itself as in previous rallies, altcoins should also rally along with Bitcoin and for a few weeks after the upcoming halving event. What gives ADA an advantage in this case is its market capitalization, which stands at an eighth position in Coinmarketcap\u2019s rankings.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince ADA\u2019s market cap is far smaller than Bitcoin\u2019s, and the total amount of coins in circulation for ADA is not far off Bitcoin\u2019s max supply, ADA could undergo a far stronger rally amid the halving event. Some analysts predict that it could increase by 2,800%.\n\nUnlike other altcoins that come and go, ADA has stood the test of time and is one of those tokens most investors would keep in their portfolios whether a massive rally takes place, finding the sweet spot between risk and reward. That puts it on the list of cryptos that are better than Bitcoin.\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nAbstract 3d rendered coin solana (SOL-USD)\n\nSource: solvertv / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) is my risky contrarian play to ride out the halving event and for a long-term hold. SOL is known for its exceptionally high throughput and low transaction costs via its unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism combined with proof-of-stake.\n\nUnfortunately, SOL took an enormous reputational hit amid the FTX exchange collapsing in 2022. At one point, it had lost 94.2% of its value. Most of the damage came from Sam Bankman-Fried praising the token despite a lack of direct exposure to FTX and Alameda Research.\n\nSOL could be undervalued and oversold. Its all-time high was $260, but it currently trades for around $69.56 at the time of writing. It then has a lot of room to surge higher to make up for the ground it lost in the FTX fiasco.\n\nThen, on a fundamental level, some analysts have posited that SOL could further benefit from the rise of meme coins in its ecosystems. These coins are wildly speculative as they usually have no utility or real intrinsic value besides what someone is willing to pay. Due to their fundamentals, they could rise the most out of all ecosystem tokens.\n\nSome of the hottest meme coins, like Bonk (BONK-USD), are based on SOL, so owning the underlying may give investors good exposure to a solid network as well as potentially explosive gains moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMatthew started writing coverage of the financial markets during the crypto boom of 2017 and was also a team member of several fintech startups. He then started writing about Australian and U.S. equities for various publications. His work has appeared in MarketBeat, FXStreet, Cryptoslate, Seeking Alpha, and the New Scientist magazine, among others.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post 3 Cryptocurrency Platforms That Could Outperform Bitcoin appeared first on InvestorPlace."
