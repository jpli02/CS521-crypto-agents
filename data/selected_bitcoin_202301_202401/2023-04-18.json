        "content": "Today, Majority Whip Tom Emmer (MN-06) and Representative French Hill (AR-02) sent a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler regarding Chair Gensler\u2019s regulatory hypocrisy and inconsistency in his treatment of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETP) applications.\n\nOver the last decade, over twenty spot bitcoin ETP applications have been filed with the SEC, but none have been approved. Chair Gensler has denied all bitcoin spot ETP applications in the United States, citing concerns over fraud and manipulation in the market. Chair Gensler, however, has authorized bitcoin futures ETPs to trade, even though the pricing for those futures contracts is derived entirely from the same market he claims is fraught with fraud and manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been unacceptable,\u201d said Emmer. \u201cChair Gensler has exhibited regulatory inconsistency between his treatment of bitcoin futures ETPs, which he has allowed to trade in the United States, and bitcoin spot ETPs, which he continually denies the American people from accessing. The SEC must provide consistency of treatment to the marketplace and retail investors in the United States are worse off because of the Chair\u2019s decision to deny all bitcoin spot ETP applications. We look forward to the SEC\u2019s response to our concerns.\u201d\n\nHill said, \u201cThe reasoning behind the SEC\u2019s continued refusal to approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) appears to be inconsistent and doesn\u2019t take into account what we know from other jurisdictions where regulators have approved similar products. We look forward to Chair Gensler\u2019s appearance before the Financial Services Committee today and his response to our letter.\u201d\n\nBoth Emmer and Hill serve as members of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nText of the letter is available here.\n\n###"

The currency broke into mainstream consciousness in 2017, as its price ran up thousands of dollars over the course of the year. More recently, it skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021, as traders saw it as a way to get rich quickly, before plummeting massively in 2022.\n\nBitcoin has created much controversy, from proponents who say it\u2019s the future of currency to those who decry it as a speculative bubble. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Bitcoin, how it works and some of its drawbacks.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin and how does it work?\n\nBitcoin debuted in 2009, when the software underpinning the currency was released. Its origins are a bit mysterious, however, and a person (or perhaps group) known as Satoshi Nakamoto claims the credit for unveiling the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin operates on a decentralized computer network or distributed ledger using blockchain technology, which manages and tracks the currency. Think of the distributed ledger like a huge public record of transactions taking place in the currency. The networked computers verify the transactions, ensuring the integrity of the data and the ownership of bitcoins, and they\u2019re rewarded with bitcoins for doing so.\n\nThis decentralized network is a huge part of the appeal of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Users can transfer money to each other, and the lack of a central bank to manage the currency makes the currency almost autonomous. This autonomy means that the currency, at least theoretically, can avoid the interference of governments and central banks.\n\nBitcoin can operate mostly anonymously. While transactions might be traceable to certain users, the person\u2019s name is not immediately tied to the transaction, even if the transaction is processed publicly. However, authorities have become better at tracking the movements of bitcoins, because the ledger of bitcoin transactions is publicly available.\n\nWhere do bitcoins come from?\n\nBitcoins are created, or \u201cmined,\u201d when computers on the network verify and process transactions in the currency. Some computers called miners are specially outfitted with high-powered processors that can chew through transactions and earn a part of a bitcoin. So Bitcoin requires a lot of processing power to maintain the network and a lot of electricity to run those computers.\n\nBitcoins aren\u2019t created infinitely, however, and the currency is limited to 21 million whole units. Experts expect the remaining number of bitcoins to be mined out around the year 2140. When this occurs, miners will be rewarded solely with a fee for processing transactions.\n\nWhile the number of bitcoins may be limited, each whole bitcoin can be split into much smaller units. In practice, bitcoins are divided into fractions of a coin to facilitate payments of very small amounts of real currency. A bitcoin can be officially divided into as many as one hundred million parts, which are called satoshi in honor of the mysterious founder.\n\nBitcoin is just one type of cryptocurrency, and literally thousands more have been created. Some of the most popular include Ethereum, Solana and XRP.\n\nUsers can hold and spend bitcoins from a cryptocurrency wallet. A wallet is like a personalized location on the distributed ledger that refers to only your currency holdings. When you acquire bitcoins, your wallet provides a unique cryptographic address to the sender. To spend or send bitcoins, you might scan a retailer\u2019s QR code or direct money to its public address.\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has some advantages as a currency and is popular for many reasons, ranging from the utopian to the capitalistic.\n\n1. Decentralized currency management\n\nThrough its decentralized network and limited number of coins, Bitcoin promises a kind of utopian version of currency. Proponents say that by getting central banks and governments out of the currency game, the currency will maintain its value better over time. By extricating these entities, some say that Bitcoin returns power to the people.\n\n2. Anonymous or semi-anonymous transactions\n\nThe relative anonymity of Bitcoin is also a huge feature for many. Some proponents (such as certain libertarians) like that the government or other authorities cannot easily track who uses the currency. However, such anonymity means that the currency can also be used for criminal activities.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that every transaction is tracked and can be used to reconstruct a given wallet\u2019s spending. It\u2019s all public, allowing any entity to track spending, creating further privacy concerns, even if it\u2019s finally not clear who owns a given wallet.\n\n3. Hard or impossible to counterfeit\n\nBitcoin\u2019s popularity is also due to an entirely practical matter, though. It\u2019s tough to counterfeit, because of the blockchain ledger system that verifies transactions over and over.\n\n4. Surging popularity\n\nBitcoin is also popular because the hype surrounding the cryptocurrency has made it a trendy trading vehicle. Because the value of the currency fluctuates so much, traders can jump in and make (or lose) money. This hype and the perceived limited nature of coins has driven the price of bitcoins much higher over the last decade, though it continues to fluctuate significantly.\n\nDisadvantages of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin suffers from some significant drawbacks that are intrinsic to its design, notably its limit on the number of coins in circulation and its general volatility.\n\n1. Bitcoin is an energy hog\n\nBig computer miners require a lot of energy to operate. Producing the electricity is expensive and pollutes the environment, for what some detractors say is a currency project with little feasibility.\n\nJust how much electricity does Bitcoin use and how much greenhouse gas does it emit? According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Bitcoin would rank as the 27th highest user of electricity, if it were a country as of April 2023. It would rank 70th in terms of its greenhouse gas emissions. Those are huge numbers for a rarely used digital currency.\n\n2. The number of coins is limited\n\nBy its very nature, the number of coins is limited, and that poses a serious problem on using Bitcoin as a currency. In effect, this limit does not allow the money supply to be increased, which is valuable when an economy experiences recession. If used throughout an economy, Bitcoin could create destructive deflationary spirals, which were more typical when economies ran on the gold standard. In fact, this concern is a key reason why the gold standard was eliminated.\n\nA challenging situation arises when consumers and others hoard currency during tough economic times. When money doesn\u2019t flow, it slows the economy. Without a central authority such as a bank to stoke the economy or offer credit, the economy could move into a deflationary spiral. So consumers don\u2019t spend because goods will be cheaper tomorrow, creating a destructive spiral.\n\nWith a fixed number of units, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t provide the flexibility needed to manage a system-wide currency.\n\n3. A volatile currency is useless\n\nImagine going to a restaurant where the prices moved up or down every day, sometimes by 10 percent or more. If this sounds like an unattractive prospect, then it\u2019s exactly what makes Bitcoin virtually useless as a currency. While volatility makes Bitcoin attractive for traders, it renders it all but worthless as a medium of exchange.\n\nConsumers need to know what a currency can buy when they make spending decisions. If they expect the currency to rise \u2013 or even skyrocket \u2013 there\u2019s little incentive for them to use it as currency.\n\n4. Government regulation is coming\n\nGovernments have been relatively slow to react to the advent of cryptocurrency, but many have now woken up and are beginning to study how to regulate it. Some countries, such as China, have banned it outright, while others are considering doing so. Still others, such as the United States, are examining how they might regulate cryptocurrency more effectively.\n\nWhat form the U.S. regulation takes remains unclear, though President Joe Biden has tasked the federal government with studying cryptocurrencies, the risks to financial stability and national security, the environmental impact and even the creation of a digital dollar.\n\nThe move to a clear regulatory framework is vital in light of the high-profile blow-up of TerraUSD, a stablecoin cryptocurrency that\u2019s meant to hold a fixed value. The creation of a digital dollar, with the stability of real dollars, may make private cryptocurrencies less attractive.\n\n5. Any transaction is reportable to the IRS\n\nThe laws surrounding cryptocurrency are onerous for consumers, making it tough to use.\n\nThe IRS now requires you to declare on your annual tax return if you\u2019ve had any transaction in a cryptocurrency in the current tax year. And if you sell crypto assets or make a transaction with one, you could create a tax liability. So you\u2019ll need to keep clear records of your buy and sell prices if you\u2019re using the digital currency, lest you run afoul of the law and run up a tax bill.\n\nHere\u2019s the full rundown on what you need to know about cryptocurrency taxes.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile Bitcoin is an interesting experiment, it has serious drawbacks that make it difficult to achieve the stated mission of being a medium of exchange or even a store of value. In fact, one of the world\u2019s greatest investors, Warren Buffett, has called the currency \u201cprobably rat poison squared\u201d and has said that it\u2019s not the kind of thing he considers an investment. Add on the fact that governments could potentially shut down the currency, and it\u2019s a risky investment at best. Still, if you\u2019re looking to get started trading cryptocurrency, here are the key things you need to know."

        "title": "The Best Bitcoin Loan Platforms of 2023 - Blockworks",
        "content": "A bitcoin loan is money, property or goods lent to a borrower using BTC as collateral. It is the permabull\u2019s ultimate hack for using BTC without the FOMO and tax burden that comes with selling.\n\nAlthough the term \u201cbitcoin loan\u201d might be unclear to some, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the loan is made in bitcoin. It is only considered a bitcoin loan if the collateral backing the loan is denominated in BTC.\n\nAdditionally, these loans are overcollateralized, which means that the value of the collateralized bitcoin exceeds the loan\u2019s value. For instance, some lenders allow borrowers to borrow up to 50% of the deposited collateral\u2019s USD value. As with traditional loans, borrowers receive their collateral back once they pay off the loan and interest in full.\n\nSo, what is the point if borrowers get back less than what they put in? This article in our series on crypto and bitcoin loans will explain the appeal and the pros and cons of different bitcoin loan platforms.\n\nWhy get a bitcoin-backed loan?\n\nLike all loans, bitcoin-backed loans aim to make the inaccessible or illiquid value of something more accessible in an open market. Traditional lenders do this by making the value of your future work or endeavors available in cash or a line of credit.\n\nBitcoin is more liquid than future work but less accessible than a common medium of exchange. First, only a few merchants and sellers accept bitcoin as payment. But more importantly, because the IRS classifies bitcoin as property, you create a taxable event every time you sell it or exchange it.\n\nThirdly, if you view your BTC holdings as an investment, you want to wait to sell until you have made a return. And if you are a bitcoin permabull, you want to avoid selling BTC for as long as possible. So while bitcoin is considered more liquid than most assets such as property and stocks, it is still less liquid than the cash in your pocket.\n\nHow it saves money\n\nA bitcoin-backed loan makes a portion of that investment available without selling bitcoin, thus retaining any potential upside and avoiding a taxable event. There are many instances where this loan would save the borrower money and even make a profit off the initial investment.\n\nSuppose a borrower uses it to buy a house, flip a used car or even buy more bitcoin. In that case, they can use the investment proceeds to repay the loan without selling any collateral. This strategy is called a leveraged investment and always comes with a degree of risk. For example, if the price of bitcoin drops during the loan duration and the borrower cannot satisfy the collateral requirement, they could lose their initial investment. Borrowers amplify this risk when they use it to buy more bitcoin.\n\nBut if the second investment pays off and the price of bitcoin increases, an investor can pay off the borrowed amount without selling their collateral and paying capital gains. And if bitcoin doubled in price, the investor can avoid selling bitcoin to pay off the loan by using that collateral to take out another bitcoin loan. This process is called rolling your debt, and it can get risky if investors do not save enough capital on the side to account for price volatility.\n\nWhen is the best time to buy?\n\nThe best time to buy BTC used as collateral for a bitcoin loan is after a significant market drawdown. Bitcoin\u2019s historical chart reveals that the leading cryptocurrency has suffered severe pullbacks of over 80% after hitting a new all-time high in a bullish market cycle.\n\nBuying BTC close to a bear market bottom allows investors to maximize the benefits of a bitcoin loan while minimizing the risk of being margin called on their position. However, the difficulty in timing the bottom of a bear market means investors using bitcoin as collateral must be wary of a continued downtrend and hedge against such an outcome. A good rule of thumb is to over-collateralize so that an 80% drawdown from the most recent all-time high won\u2019t liquidate your collateral. Considering a move where the investor uses the credit line to acquire more bitcoin, their portfolio gains substantially as the market trends upwards following a market bottom.\n\nBenefits vs. risks\n\nA bitcoin-backed loan may be a no-brainer given BTC\u2019s historical performance and ability to recover from severe drawdowns. Yet, these loans come with risks that investors must recognize before using the option. This section discusses the benefits and risks when you borrow against BTC.\n\nBenefits\n\nInstant liquidity: Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset compared to other assets such as real estate, bonds, and stocks. A bitcoin loan allows investors to tap into bitcoin\u2019s highly liquid nature within same-day funding. Since loans are overcollateralized, most platforms do not subject users to credit checks and paper filings that could delay access to liquidity as with other financial assets.\n\nGreater returns: Since bitcoin loans allow investors to borrow money without spending their bitcoins, they can generate greater returns as the value of their collateral increases. For example, if the value of the collateral doubles, the investors can sell half of it to pay off the loan. This would still incur similar and possibly greater capital gains to selling the same amount of BTC prior to the loan. But in this case, the investor nets a greater profit because they avoided selling BTC at half the price.\n\nTax benefits: Bitcoin loans can save investors from the tax headaches associated with selling bitcoins to book profits or losses. The borrowing transaction is not a taxable event in most jurisdictions. Users do not need to file tax returns until they choose to sell the BTC collateral in the future.\n\nCollateral/token value: During severe market downturns, BTC historically records less volatility compared to other crypto assets. Thus, a loan backed by bitcoin can better weather market pullbacks while saving investors from platform risks associated with using altcoins as collateral.\n\nRisks\n\nCollateral liquidation: Investors risk losing their BTC collateral if the asset\u2019s price drops substantially below capital requirements. Failure to supply additional collateral upon a margin call will cause the bitcoin loan platform to liquidate deposited BTC to cover the borrowed amount. Bitcoin\u2019s volatile nature also means that such drops could happen quickly, catching investors off guard.\n\nTechnology risks: Blockchain technology and underpinning technologies such as smart contracts, cross-chain bridge protocols, and currency peg mechanisms are still in their infancy. Users risk losing funds to technology risks such as bugs and security breaches. Even simpler risks, such as transferring funds to the wrong addresses, could lead to permanent losses due to the irreversibility of blockchain transactions.\n\nThird-party risks: Investors take on several counterparty risks when they obtain bitcoin loans through a platform that requires the transfer of assets to the centralized entity. The platform could rehypothecate user deposits for personal interests or suffer a security breach. In some cases, the bitcoin loan platform is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning investors cannot pursue legal recourse in the event of a loss.\n\nHow does it work\n\nWhen borrowers take out a Bitcoin loan, they use their deposited bitcoins as collateral for the amount they borrow in fiat currency. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio sets the maximum USD value the borrower can borrow. Also, it determines the price at which the deposited assets may be sold to cover the borrowed amount.\n\nCustomers are incentivized to add more collateral to avoid an impending liquidation. For example, consider a user that deposits $1,000 worth of BTC with a 50% LTV. They can borrow up to 50% of the deposited amount, $500 in fiat USD or stablecoins. Assuming the bitcoin loan platform stipulates an 80% LTV threshold for liquidation, the user risks losing their BTC collateral if its value drops by 80% of the borrowed amount (which amounts to $400 in our example).\n\nBitcoin loan categories\n\nIrrespective of the model used to generate profit from loan issuance, bitcoin loan providers usually fall into two categories: decentralized and centralized platforms. The primary difference is in where the platform stores deposited bitcoins.\n\nDeFi protocols: Investors can borrow against BTC using DeFi protocols built on layer-2 bitcoin network solutions such as RSK, Stacks, Liquid and Fedimints. Users usually retain self-custody while lending or locking assets on autonomous protocols. Here are some popular options on each network.\n\nRSK \u2013 Sovryn, Tropykus\n\n\u2013 Sovryn, Tropykus Stacks \u2013 ALEX\n\n\u2013 ALEX Liquid \u2013 Lend at Hodl Hodl\n\n\u2013 Lend at Hodl Hodl Fedimints\n\nCeFi lenders: are centralized bitcoin loan issuers that hold custody over user assets. They typically require users to complete an identity verification process and may impose limits on user accounts. Popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Bitfinex are examples of CeFi lenders that offer bitcoin loan services.\n\nWhere to get a Bitcoin-backed loan\n\nInvestors can get a bitcoin-backed loan using any lending platform in this section. Readers must weigh the risks and benefits of each platform and choose one based on their portfolio size and investment objectives.\n\nPros Cons No tokenomics\n\nNo fractional reserve banking as all loans are backed 1:1\n\nNo derivatives product to drive irresponsible trading\n\nNo rehypothecation of user assets.\n\nNo yield product, which adds additional risk to the business.\n\nOn-chain proof of reserves via BitGo.\n\nEmail & SMS notifications if the threshold is in danger of being breached No self-custody solution yet\n\nManual application process and KYC requirements\n\nVerify 21 embraces the tried and tested model of bitcoin-only backed loans and narrows the main risks for the client down to the liquidation price of the loan and the custody of collateral. Clients maintain complete control over their LTV ratio as they may add or remove collateral to match their loan profile.\n\nMeanwhile, Verify 21 secures user funds by adopting cold wallets provided by leading custodian service BitGo and proof of reserves scheme to imbibe user trust. Verify 21\u2019s traditional approach poses minimal risks compared to DeFi lenders or centralized entities with a mix of tokenomics and yield generation activities. The company\u2019s business model is more similar to a traditional bank, giving people an extremely secure way to borrow, which does not exist in most parts of the world.\n\nPros Cons No interest rates.\n\nNon-custodial contracts handle loan issuance, repayment and liquidations.\n\nNo KYC requirements\n\nHigh collateralization and a Stability Pool mechanism lower the risk of loan default. Vulnerable to smart contract bugs\n\nUsers risk losing funds to an RBTC depeg.\n\nSovryn Zero is a decentralized trading and lending protocol built on Rootstock (RSK). This bitcoin sidechain relies on the legacy Bitcoin network for security. Users must bridge BTC to RBTC (a pegged version of Bitcoin on RSK) to access the Sovryn Zero protocol and borrow against BTC.\n\nSovryn Zero requires a 110% over-collateralization for loans, meaning users must always hold a BTC amount higher than they borrow. The protocol issues loans in its ZUSD stablecoin, which users can convert to cash or RBTC after paying the loan origination fee. While Sovryn features an SOV token used for protocol governance, users must not hold them to access Bitcoin loans.\n\nPros Cons No interest rates or origination fees\n\nLightning Network support for BTC deposits\n\nThe platform is non-custodial, meaning users can automatically redeem their capital by repaying their loan.\n\nNo rehypothecation as funds are managed on-chain via smart contracts LBTC and the addition of synthetic assets impose a depeg risk.\n\nUsers also run the risk of oracle manipulation and smart contract bugs\n\nFuji Finance is a decentralized and non-custodial protocol built on the layer-2 Bitcoin network, Liquid. Fuji enables users to lock Liquid BTC (LBTC) \u2013 a version of bitcoin on the Liquid network \u2013 as collateral to borrow synthetic assets such as its FUSD stablecoin, stocks, and bonds. The platform mints $1 in FUSD for every $1.5 in BTC deposited, ensuring an over-collateralization of user deposits.\n\nFuji charges a fixed 0.25% fee on loan repayments but no interest rate or loan origination fees. There is no time limit for repayments.
