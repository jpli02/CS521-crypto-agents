But as the applications piled up, US regulators repeatedly declined to approve one, citing the risk of fraud and market manipulation in cryptocurrency markets. But with the entrance of BlackRock Inc. into the race, many market watchers are hopeful that one or more spot-Bitcoin ETFs will finally get the go-ahead. After all, the world\u2019s largest asset manager has a strong track record of getting funds past regulatory roadblocks. On this week\u2019s episode of the What Goes Up podcast, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence join to discuss how BlackRock\u2019s application dramatically changes the outlook for Bitcoin ETFs. \u201cWhen they filed, it was a whole different ballgame in my opinion,\u201d says Balchunas. \u201cThe fact is they generally like to bring a gun to a knife fight. This is a firm who doesn\u2019t like to lose, who knows what they're doing, and they must see something.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin falls to lowest level in nearly two months after Fed minutes dial up inflation concerns - CNBC",
        "content": "The minutes cautioned that Fed officials see \"upside risks\" to inflation that could potentially lead to more rate hikes. At that meeting, Fed raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest in more than 22 years . Markets have been betting the central bank wouldn't make any more moves on interest rates this year. In reaction, the stock market fell for a second straight day Wednesday and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its highest close since 2008.\n\nBitcoin was last lower by about 4% at $27,901.60, according to Coin Metrics. The slide began after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting were released Wednesday. Earlier Thursday, it fell to $27,858.94, its lowest level since June 20.\n\nCryptocurrencies were under pressure Thursday as investors grappled with renewed concerns about the U.S. economy.\n\nBitcoin's correlation with stocks is at its lowest level in two years, according to Coin Metrics, but in 2022 it shot to an all-time high in response to the Fed's rate-hiking campaign to tame inflation.\n\n\"Although inflation in itself could be an argument for growth in crypto assets, with inflation comes other aspects like risk off appetite from investors fearing a recession, and avoiding what bitcoin is deemed to be, riskier assets,\" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.\n\n\"My suspicion is that the higher beta equities and crypto are the victims of the end of summer lag, range-bound trading, no volume, which is typical in August \u2014 with the hawkish Fed as the cherry on top to keep investors to the side and prices in this tight range,\" Jablonski said.\n\nBitcoin and ether's 90-day volatility dropped to multiyear lows at 35% and 37% this week, respectively, according to Kaiko.\n\nNeedham's John Todaro added that bitcoin's move back to $30,000 in late June \"had been on light volume so that rally has not had a ton of strength.\" The eventual debut of a spot bitcoin ETF, one of crypto's biggest positive catalysts, also lost some steam this week, he added.\n\n\"With a U.S. [spot bitcoin] ETF likely not seeing a near term decision given the setback this week as well as expectations for higher rates for longer, bitcoin and crypto broadly are pulling back,\" he told CNBC. \"Remaining catalysts are Halving expectations in Q1-Q2 '24 and any on-going ETF related comments from the SEC.\"\n\nSeveral of the top crypto assets by market cap \u2014 including Binance's BNB coin , Ripple's XRP and the solana and polygon coins \u2014 were lower by more than 3% on Thursday. Ether fell 4%."

        "title": "Bitcoin shaken out of lull by SpaceX sale worries - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nBitcoin has been shaken out of its summer lull on fears that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX had written down some of the value of its cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nThe flagship token was down 5.1 per cent on Friday, having fallen by nearly 8 per cent during an hour of frenzied trading late on Thursday, coinciding with a report in the Wall Street Journal that SpaceX had written down its bitcoin by $373mn in the past two years and had sold some coins.\n\nIts sudden reversal echoed declines in global stock and bond prices this week as investors are forced to adjust their expectations that US interest rates will stay high, even as the economy remains robust.\n\nThe Federal Reserve lifted its benchmark rate to its highest level in 22 years last month and left the door open to further increases this year. In spite of moves in other assets, the price of bitcoin has remained within a tight trading range over the past two months.\n\nMusk is regarded as one of the crypto market\u2019s biggest cheerleaders and lifted the prices of alternative coins when he mentioned them on his X social media platform. His electric-car company Tesla briefly flirted with accepting payment in the cryptocurrency in 2021 and also ploughed $1.5bn of its own cash into the tokens.\n\nBut bitcoin registered a sharp reversal when Musk abandoned the plans three months later. Since then, the value of the carmaker\u2019s own holdings has fluctuated. Tesla last year recorded $204mn in impairment losses related to its bitcoin holdings.\n\n\u201cHistory shows that the market often reacts sharply to Elon Musk\u2019s actions, implying that this latest revelation could further dampen investor sentiment,\u201d said James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, an investment group.\n\nLow trading volumes and decreased volatility also had an impact, he said, as it \u201cmade the market susceptible to larger trades\u201d.\n\nLiquidity and activity in crypto markets have dried up this year as US regulators have cracked down on illicit activity and charged some of the market\u2019s biggest names, including Binance and Coinbase, with violating federal markets laws.\n\nIllustrating the thin liquidity, yesterday it would have taken the sale of 463 bitcoins \u2014 worth about $12mn \u2014 to push the price of the coin down by one per cent of its prevailing market value, according to CCData, an industry information provider.\n\n\n\nIn March, when crypto markets were convulsed by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, it would have taken the sale of 856 bitcoins, then roughly equivalent to $17mn, to move the price of the token by more than 1 per cent.\n\nIn June the SEC filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, claiming they had broken the law by selling digital tokens to members of the public without filing the required registrations. The two companies have denied the allegations and vowed to defend themselves in court."
