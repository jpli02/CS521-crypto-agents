        "content": "Federal appeals court judges in Washington grilled the US Securities and Exchange Commission on its decision to reject a proposed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund when it had earlier approved a similar product based on Bitcoin futures.\n\nGrayscale Investments LLC wants to convert its $14 billion Bitcoin trust, the largest investment vehicle tied to the No. 1 cryptocurrency, into an ETF. But the SEC rejected the plan in June, saying crypto markets are too ripe for fraud and manipulation. Grayscale sued, asking the DC Circuit Court to overturn a decision the company called arbitrary and discriminatory because the SEC had already approved ETFs that track Bitcoin futures."

        "title": "Can bitcoin hedge inflation, and other questions to which the answer is no - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\n\u201cConfidence must be earned\u201d is the current ad slogan of Amundi, Europe\u2019s biggest asset manager. Keep it in mind while reading its latest thematic paper on what might follow crypto winter.\n\nParis-based Amundi can appear a bit bipolar about crypto. Last February it was reportedly investigating how to sell NFTs to clients while warning them about the \u201cpotentially destabilising systemic risk\u201d of stablecoins. Former chief investment officer Pascal Blanqu\u00e9 called bitcoin a \u201cfarce\u201d; his successor Vincent Mortier is more amenable:\n\n\u201cIf inflation remains above central banks\u2019 targets, bitcoin\u2019s limited supply may start to attract more attention,\u201d write Mortier and strategist Tristan Perrier:\n\nWhile bitcoin spectacularly failed to protect investors against galloping inflation in 2021-22, this was a period of dramatic rises in policy and market interest rates that pressured all asset classes. If inflation is high, but not rising, nominal interest rates will also likely stop climbing and may even fall a little. This is a much more favourable environment for an asset whose supply is finite and that has a long duration in essence, as its main attraction is its future potential rather than its current status.\n\nAnd sure, maybe? The evidence we have suggests that as an inflation hedge bitcoin is useless (Smales, 2021), mostly useless (Conlon et al, 2021), randomly worse than useless (Matkovskyy and Jalan, 2020), or consistently worse than useless (Pinchuk, 2021). The inflation discussion also invites broader questions around whether finite supply is a precondition of all forms of existence (Aristotle, 350BC), and whether \u201cfuture potential\u201d can matter when applied to something that has unquantifiable exogenous risks but no intrinsic value (Amundi, 2021). But then, a firm doesn\u2019t collect more than almost \u20ac2tn in assets by seeding FUD.\n\nAmundi\u2019s \u201cfive reasons why recent setbacks may not mean the end of cryptocurrencies\u201d will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s been to Davos or Reddit. There\u2019s the shakeout, where a dotcom-style crash leaves behind a leaner group of eventual winners. There\u2019s proof-of-stake mining as a route out of the energy boondoggle. There\u2019s regulation, which \u201cis more likely than not to be a positive in the end\u201d. And there are signs that the financial mainstream hasn\u2019t abandoned all hope in crypto, Amundi says, somewhat self-referentially.\n\nWhat\u2019s important, Mortier and Perrier suggest, is to separate practice from theory. The experienced reality of crypto (fraud, hubris, incompetence, or some yet-to-be-determined combination of all three) might look unappealing but it\u2019s mostly just TradFi doing TradFi things, so the theory (code-is-law decentralisation) has emerged \u201cmostly unscathed\u201d.\n\nAnd sure? Mayyyyy-be?\n\nA person might argue that the dotcom bust wasn\u2019t defined primarily by bankruptcies and fraud \u2014 or had more promoter fraud and less alleged theft \u2014 which allowed for a period of industry consolidation and retrenchment. That\u2019s unlikely to happen to crypto. They might argue that in its current form, proof-of-stake mining invites concentration of control so is in direct opposition to Amundi\u2019s core argument. They might see recent crypto press releases from mainstream companies less as a sign of a healthy ecosystem than as the light only just reaching us from a long-dead star.\n\nAs for the positive tailwind of legitimacy through regulation, programmer Stephen Diehl posed the key question on these pixels earlier this month: without a point, what\u2019s the point?\n\nAmundi says that for investors to remain interested in crypto, someone\u2019s going to have to find something productive to do with a blockchain. Financial asset tokenisation is interesting in theory, but applying the concept comes with big hurdles around legality, delivery and adoption.\n\nThese are fair points but again are perhaps not up with recent developments, such as China\u2019s use of blockchain for some ABS contracts. While the experiment might be lowering costs by a few basis points, research so far hasn\u2019t been entirely convincing.\n\nMortier and Perrier conclude:\n\nBlockchains, cryptocurrencies and tokenisation do have a lot of potential, be it in powering new types of decentralised organisations that can offer serious economic and social advantages, or in enabling new ways of trading and managing assets. The most likely outcome is that they will simply need more time to mature before becoming mainstream, as was the case for other technologies in the past. However, they could still turn out to be a dead-end (which could allow time for another cryptocurrencies bull market to last a few years but not much more). At this stage, nothing is proven either way and the jury is still very much out.\n\nIsn\u2019t it normal to give evidence to a jury before expecting its verdict?"
