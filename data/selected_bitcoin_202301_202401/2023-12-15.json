        "title": "Better Bitcoin Stock: MicroStrategy vs. Riot Platforms - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "bitcoin-tokens\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) represent two different ways to invest in Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) rally of about 150% this year. MicroStrategy is a software company that started hoarding Bitcoin over the past three years. Riot is a leading Bitcoin mining company that mines BTC with its massive fleet of high-end miners.\n\nBoth stocks have skyrocketed this year, along with Bitcoin's price. MicroStrategy's stock has risen more than 290% this year, while Riot's stock has rallied more than 310%. Should investors chase either of these high-flying Bitcoin-related stocks right now?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMicroStrategy operates two different businesses\n\nAt its core, MicroStrategy is an aging data mining and analytics company founded 34 years ago. It's expanded its ecosystem with more mobile and cloud services over the past two decades, but it's been struggling to keep pace with higher-growth cloud giants like Salesforce, Microsoft, and Amazon in the rapidly evolving market. That's why MicroStrategy's revenue grew at an anemic compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of less than 1% from 2010 to 2020.\n\nBut in August 2020, MicroStrategy's co-founder and then-CEO Michael Saylor drove the company to start spending the software segment's cash on big Bitcoin purchases. Its BTC holdings have risen from $250 million in its first big purchase to $4.7 billion in its latest quarter. That's more than 40% of MicroStrategy's current enterprise value of $9.4 billion.\n\nMicroStrategy currently holds 158,400 BTC on its balance sheet at an average purchase price of $29,586 -- so its investment is back in the black as of this writing. However, its rising BTC impairment charges also caused it to stay unprofitable over the past three years, while its issuing of fresh debt to fund its BTC purchases boosted its debt-to-equity ratio to 3.0. On the bright side, it's expected to return to profitability this year as it books lower impairment charges.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut as investors focus on its BTC investments, its core software business remains sluggish. Its total revenue only rose 1% year over year in the first nine months of 2023 as rising subscription revenue finally offset its declining product license and support revenues. Analysts expect its revenue to rise a mere 1% for the full year.\n\nThe bulls argue that MicroStrategy's enterprise value will eventually soar as it continues to buy BTC and stabilize its software business. However, a lot of growth could already be baked into its stock at 21 times next year's sales.\n\nRiot is a more straightforward Bitcoin play\n\nRiot was once a tiny patent holding company known as Bioptix, but it ditched its original business model and transformed into a dedicated BTC miner in 2017. It then purchased tens of thousands of top-tier Antminers from Bitmain.\n\nRiot had deployed a massive fleet of 112,944 miners by the end of November, which enables it to produce an average of 18.4 BTC every day. It's been selling hundreds of Bitcoins each month to boost its liquidity, but it was still holding 7,358 BTC (with a market value of $306 million) on its balance sheet at the end of November.\n\nRiot's business model is simpler than MicroStrategy's, but its fate is tethered to BTC's market price and volatile energy prices. In 2022, its revenue rose 22% to $259 million -- but its net loss widened from $8 million to $510 million as BTC's price plunged and energy prices spiked. However, analysts expect its revenue to rise 14% to $294 million this year as it narrows its net loss to $201 million.\n\nIf Bitcoin's price continues to rise as inflation cools off, Riot's revenues and profits could soar. It also plans to keep selling its excess power back to the grid at spot prices to stabilize its long-term operating margins. Riot can keep selling its own BTC to boost its cash flows, and its low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.1 still gives it plenty of room to raise more cash. And with an enterprise value of $2.9 billion, Riot looks a lot cheaper than MicroStrategy at 6 times next year's sales.\n\nBetter buy: Riot Platforms\n\nI personally think it makes more sense to directly buy Bitcoin instead of investing in these two capital-intensive companies. But if I had to choose one, I'd pick Riot because its business model is more straightforward, its growth rates are more stable, its balance sheet is healthier, and its stock looks cheaper relative to its long-term growth potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and MicroStrategy wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Can Help Fight Methane Emissions - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Traditionally, the mining industry has been vilified for its environmental impact and energy use. This article describes the industry where mining can have an immediate positive impact \u2013 fossil fuel operations.\n\nBackground\n\nThe run-up to November 2023 COP28 in Dubai has seen a flurry of activity from the world\u2019s three largest economies on the question of energy sector methane. That month, China published its long-awaited Methane Emissions Control Action Plan, followed by the China-US Sunnylands Statement on Enhancing Cooperation to Address the Climate Crisis and the European Council and Parliament announcing a deal on new rules to cut methane emissions in the energy sector. Prolific emitters, like Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, added themselves to the 150 signatories of the Global Methane Pledge.\n\nThe momentum continued, with 50 oil and gas companies that represent 40% of global petroleum production signing the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter and committing to end methane emissions and routine gas flaring by 2030.\n\nFinally, the world is waking up to the fact that if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050, we must act decisively to stop the venting and flaring of methane from the global oil, gas, and coal industries.\n\nBut amongst the excitement, it is forgotten that reducing the flaring and venting of methane necessarily involves capturing and utilizing it. A question no one seems to be asking is what to do with all this methane.\n\nThe Bad And The Ugly Of Fossil Fuel Methane\n\nThe atmospheric methane emissions have tripled since the start of the industrial revolution, believed to be responsible for 0.5 degrees of the 1 degree warming we saw to date. The International Panel on Climate Change states that if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050, we must act decisively on methane.\n\nThe International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) Methane Tracker estimates that one-third of man-made methane emissions comes from the production, transportation, and use of fossil fuels. This totals around 120 million tonnes of methane annually, evenly split between the oil, gas, and coal industries. The impact is equivalent to 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide \u2013 more than the United States' and EU\u2019s CO2 emissions combined.\n\nThe IEA\u2019s Net Zero by 2050 roadmap states that in order to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, the energy sector must reduce its methane emissions by 75% by 2030, predominantly through the \u201cthe rapid deployment of measures and technologies to eliminate avoidable methane emissions by 2030.\u201d\n\nThe Methane Tracker shows that 75% of global fossil fuel methane emissions come from 10 regions:\n\nThe Potential Role Of Bitcoin Mining In Greenhouse Gas Reduction\n\nIn September 2022, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published a report on Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States. One of the report\u2019s conclusions was that \u201ccrypto-asset mining operations that capture vented methane to produce electricity can yield positive results for the climate, by converting the potent methane to CO2 during combustion\u2026; could potentially be more reliable and more efficient at converting methane to CO2 [than flaring]... and \u2026is more likely to help rather than hinder U.S. climate objectives.\u201d\n\nThe IPCC estimates that over 20 years, a tonne of methane has a climate change impact equivalent to 80 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Hiveon, a top-rated suite of mining products, calculates that using otherwise vented methane to generate the electricity needed to produce one Bitcoin would lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 6\u2019000 tonnes of CO2, or the annual emissions of 1,400 passenger cars in the US.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge the crypto industry\u2019s carbon emissions, but also believe in its ability to act as an important tool in combatting climate change. That\u2019s why we launched Hiveon Energy, a project in the intersection of the blockchain field and traditional energy industries. It\u2019s our contribution to making mining more sustainable while also helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d \u2013 Andrii Garanin, VP of Hiveon Energy.\n\nJust 1MW of Bitcoin mining equipment could destroy over 800 tonnes of methane annually, providing greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to a typical 140 MW solar facility in the US. With just the global Bitcoin industry requiring 10-15 GW of power generation capacity, it has huge potential to reduce methane emissions.\n\nWhy Mining\n\nThe IEA estimates that it\u2019s possible to capture and use 75% of the methane vented from oil and gas production and about 50% from coal. Methane is a valuable commodity, but there is a reason why so much of it is vented rather than sold or utilized.\n\nThis is because the majority of vented energy sector methane is almost by definition stranded gas. Fossil fuel operators are profit-driven, so if they had a way to monetize the wasted methane, they would have used it.\n\nVented methane comes from regions like Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, the Middle East, Caspian, etc. These regions are already massive producers of fossil fuels, so they have few customers for natural gas. It needs to be transported to customers as LNG, through pipelines, or as electricity, which involves extensive investments in infrastructure, as well as substantial legal, regulatory, and commercial barriers.\n\nThese investments have long payback periods, making them challenging in the current context where the world needs to rapidly ramp down its production of fossil fuels.\n\nThe mining industry can act as a global buyer of stranded natural gas. Miners require no access to the grid or power markets \u2013 just the gas supply, a plot of land, and an internet connection.\n\nMost importantly, because such projects can use modular, mobile solutions, the equipment can be moved easily and cheaply in case of localized issues around gas supply or power demand.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nUndeniably, the global crypto industry is a large consumer of electricity, part of which comes from the burning of fossil fuels. But it\u2019s also a major potential customer for otherwise vented methane, providing an enormous opportunity to reduce methane emissions globally.\n\nThe major barrier is a lack of knowledge from global policymakers and the mining industry about the workings of such an enterprise. Despite the challenges, we need policies that will promote the use of vented gas, or at least not hinder it by regulations such as blanket bans on mining.\n\nAs stated by Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, \u201cThe world will break down if we don\u2019t fix the energies we use today. The world will break down if we don\u2019t mitigate the emissions on a gigaton scale.\u201d\n\nThis is a guest post by Andrii Garanin.
