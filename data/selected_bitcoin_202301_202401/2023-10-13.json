        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission will not ask a federal appeals court to reconsider a ruling that paves the way for Grayscale Investments LLC to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nIn August, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert its trust into an exchange-traded fund. The ruling was made by just three of the judges on the court and the regulator could have sought a review by a full slate of judges. The agency is not planning any other appeals in the case, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the ongoing matter."

        "content": "\u201cContrary to popular belief, Bitcoin did not appear out of nothing. For decades prior to Satoshi Nakamoto introducing his invention, a diverse group of computer scientists, privacy activists, and heterodox economists tried to create a digital form of money that could operate independently of government control. The Genesis Book tells the story of the people and projects that inspired the invention of the world's first successful peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\u201d\n\n-Cover Sypnosis\n\nAaron van Wirdum\u2019s long awaited book goes through the pre-history of everything that led up to the creation of Bitcoin. So many individual ideas and concepts went into the creation of Bitcoin that people tend to forget the history of those pieces before Satoshi glued them together into the Bitcoin protocol we know today.\n\nThe Genesis Book gives the readers a long walk through the history of both the people and cultural movements spawned out of the early rise of the hacker community, and how these cultural movements and their respective ethoses shaped the technologies themselves that were produced. The ethos and mentality of the members of early counter-culture groups like the cypherpunks and extropians laid the ideological foundation of the cultures we see thriving in Bitcoin today.\n\nThese same people also laid the technical foundations Bitcoin itself was built upon, through early attempts at digital cash systems like David Chaum\u2019s ecash, to Wei Dai\u2019s b-money. Concepts like Adam Back\u2019s Hashcash and Hal Finney\u2019s Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW) also began the slow road towards Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work consensus system.\n\nFor anyone who wants to truly understand the pre-history of Bitcoin, and the people and technological inventions that laid the groundwork for Satoshi\u2019s gift to us, this book is a must read.\n\n\n\nThe book is available for pre-order here, with shipments expected to go out starting on January 3rd, 2024."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nLatest Prices\n\nTop Stories\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has outperformed other cryptocurrencies amid macroeconomic uncertainty, partially due to traders pricing a potential approval of spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Coinbase Institutional. \"We think the divergence in the performance of bitcoin and other tokens shows that the potential approval of one or more spot bitcoin ETPs has already been partially priced in. That makes it less clear how much more bitcoin could outperform if a favorable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision occurs,\" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase Institutional, said in the latest monthly report sent to subscribers on Thursday.\n\nU.S. regulators have targeted former Voyager Digital CEO Steve Ehrlich with lawsuits claiming he engaged in fraud and deliberately misrepresented his customers\u2019 government protections. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced related actions against Ehrlich on Thursday, with the CFTC also including in its court filing that Circle's USDC stablecoin and bitcoin as commodities. The CFTC accused Ehrlich of defrauding customers by misleading them about the strength of the company and doing business without proper registrations. The FTC said he lied about customers\u2019 funds being protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nCaroline Ellison, 28, wrapped up her testimony on Thursday, her third day of questioning in the Sam Bankman-Fried trial. Sporting the same gray blazer as the last two days, Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend was asked about her company's accounting. Alameda engaged with a few accountants in 2021 to 2022, but after those firms reviewed Alameda's books, \"they found they couldn't or wouldn't do it,\" Ellison said, as she faced questions from Attorney Mark Cohen. Former FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame initially prepared Alameda's balance sheets, but at some point, Ellison took over this task, she testified. The company's financials are at the center of Bankman-Fried's demise. An award-winning CoinDesk story in November 2022 that cited Alameda's confidential balance sheet caused many to doubt the viability of Alameda and FTX.\n\nStory continues\n\nChart of The Day\n\nThe chart shows the Ethereum mainnet's daily fee revenue since early 2020.\n\nFees have reached the lowest since the DeFi boom of Summer in 2020.\n\nThe decrease is putting ETH's \"ultra sound money\" thesis to a test, according to IntoTheBlock.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\n- Omkar Godbole\n\nTrending Posts"

Read preview\n\nPentagon officials monitoring a Bitcoin operation in Wyoming that sits across from a Microsoft data center and a nearby military base are worried that the owners' ties to China could pose a national security threat, per The New York Times.\n\nMicrosoft believed the location could allow the Chinese government to \"pursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations\" directed at the data center and the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, which houses ICBMs.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe crypto mining operation first came under the US government's purview after a team at Microsoft submitted a report to the Committee on Foreign Investment in August 2022. The team believed the mining operation had the potential to collect information from the data center, which supports the operational needs of the Pentagon, the Times reported.\n\n\"Microsoft has no direct indications of malicious activities by this entity,\" Microsoft wrote, per the Times. \"However, pending further discovery, we suggest the possibility that the computing power of an industrial-level cryptomining operation, along with the presence of an unidentified number of Chinese nationals in direct proximity to Microsoft's Data Center and one of three strategic-missile bases in the US, provides significant threat vectors.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2021, China banned the resource-intensive practice of Bitcoin mining . Businesses in the cryptocurrency market scrambled to establish themselves in other countries, including the US.\n\nThe Times identified mines in 12 states that were owned by Chinese nationals. Per the outlet, some had ties to the Chinese government, some did not, and others could not be easily traced.\n\nThe Cheyenne, Wyoming, center was one such mine, per the Times. The Times reported that the mining operation is linked to five different companies, with one company, Bit Origin Ltd., previously registered as a pork-processing company in the Cayman Islands.\n\nLi Jiaming, the president of Bit Origin Ltd., said that the Microsoft data center or the nearby military base had nothing to do with why the area was chosen. Instead, the mine was placed there because a local utility company agreed to work with Bit Origin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Even though we are a Microsoft neighbor and a couple of miles from the base, without power it is nothing \u2014 the business cannot succeed,\" Jiaming told the Times.\n\nOfficials who spoke with the Times cited concerns that the mines, which use an immense amount of electricity in their operations, would be used to purposefully overwhelm electrical grids to cause planned blackouts and complete other cyberattacks."

        "content": "SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the digital asset space with a belief the price of assets such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) will go up.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Scaramucci fought back against Bitcoin bears like Warren Buffett.\n\nWhat Happened: Legendary investor Buffett is best known as the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B), a conglomerate that owns many companies and invests in multiple public companies.\n\nFor those in the cryptocurrency space, Buffett is familiar as one of the biggest bears of Bitcoin, an asset he once famously called \u201crat poison squared.\u201d\n\nScaramucci said the bear case by Buffett and others is that Bitcoin is just a cryptograph on the internet, worth nothing, shouldn\u2019t have value and should be banned.\n\n\u201cThey really don\u2019t understand the concept and the whole history of money,\u201d Scaramucci said on a recent episode of \u201cThe Raz Report.\u201d\n\nScaramucci said paper money is worthless by definition but we ascribe a value to it. Digital in a bank account are worth something and can be sent in wire transfers to pay for items.\n\nThe SkyBridge Capital founder said the world has always had a ledger and put value on items giving them monetary value.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it that way, Bitcoin is a fairly perfect ledger.\u201d\n\nScaramucci said Bitcoin is transparent and fully decentralized.\n\nThe 14-year-old history of Bitcoin and increased use of people using it as a payment and the efficiency improvements by the lightning network are also eliminating the thesis from the Bitcoin bears.\n\nScaramucci added the trust and integrity of Bitcoin make it valuable.\n\nRelated Link: Exclusive: Yusko Calls Out Warren Buffett, The Reason Warren Wants To P*** On Bitcoin Is...\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: In the interview, Scaramucci shared he believes the pending launch of Bitcoin ETFs could serve as a catalyst to take the price of Bitcoin higher in 2024.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m right, we could be sitting at $150k, $250k Bitcoin,\u201d Scaramucci said.\n\nScaramucci praised the \u201cfinite supply\u201d of Bitcoin and also considered it a potential hedge against the future devaluing of the U.S. dollar.\n\nWhile Buffett may be critical of Bitcoin and its future, one of his portfolio holdings is betting on the continued growth of digital banking and making it easier for customers in Latin America to trade cryptocurrency.\n\nAs previously shared by Benzinga, Buffett is a holder of stock in Nu Holdings Ltd (NYSE: NU), which gives him exposure to an asset he absolutely despises.\n\nRead Next: Exclusive: Mark Yusko On Bitcoin's Future, 2024 Price Target\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event: Future of Digital Assets.
