        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will not approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund \u2014 at least, that's the opinion of the agency's former Office of Internet Enforcement chief, John Reed Stark.\n\n\"My take is that the current SEC will NOT approve a bitcoin spot ETF application for a range of compelling reasons,\" Stark wrote today on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nHowever, Stark shared that if a Republican wins the White House in 2024, the SEC will likely decrease its crypto-enforcement efforts and \"become far more receptive to approving a bitcoin spot ETF and far more likely to take other significant crypto-friendly regulatory actions.\"\n\nStark also claims that if the next President is a Republican, current SEC chair Gary Gensler \"would likely resign,\" and Hester Peirce \u2014 known as \"Crypto Mom\" in the industry \u2014 could become acting chair, and \"crypto-related SEC disruption would grind to a screeching halt.\"\n\nSEC vs. crypto\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe SEC has, in recent history, stepped up crypto-enforcement efforts.\n\nEarlier this week, crypto exchange Bittrex settled with the agency for $24 million after being charged for operating as an unregistered exchange in April.\n\nThe SEC also filed a letter with the Southern District of New York on Wednesday seeking leave for an interlocutory appeal in the summary judgment order in the Ripple Labs case \u2014 widely seen as a partial defeat for the agency.\n\nTo date, the SEC has approved no spot Bitcoin ETF after years of attempts."
