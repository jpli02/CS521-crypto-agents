Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nBitcoin's annual transaction volume has outpaced Visa. This is a significant milestone, especially when you consider that Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network and has not achieved global usage on the scale of Visa. But before popping the champagne, let's delve into some nuances that often go unnoticed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst off, the term \"transaction volume\" can be a bit misleading. In Bitcoin's case, a large chunk of network activity in the past year came from Ordinals \u2014 a protocol that allows satoshis in the blockchain to be assigned a unique identifier and transacted with extra data like images, for example. The protocol conducts high-frequency transactions. So, while the sheer volume of transactions is impressive, it is not necessarily indicative of widespread retail use or adoption.\n\nBitcoin has surpassed Visa's annual transaction volume. Pretty incredible for a decentralized settlement network.\n\n\n\nNext up: ACH and ultimately Fedwire. pic.twitter.com/32VTILMNXI \u2014 Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) September 16, 2023\n\nNow, why is it tricky to compare Visa and crypto networks like Bitcoin in terms of transactions? Well, Visa is a centralized payment system that has been around for decades, fine-tuned for consumer transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a decentralized network where transactions can represent anything from a coffee purchase to a multi-million-dollar asset transfer. The two are fundamentally different beasts, each with its own set of rules, limitations and use cases.\n\nThat said, Bitcoin surpassing Visa in transaction volume is still a momentous occasion. It is a testament to the growing influence of decentralized networks. It also raises questions about what the financial landscape could look like in the future. Could decentralized networks one day become the norm, rendering centralized systems obsolete?\n\nAs for now, full adoption of decentralized payments is not going as smoothly as crypto enthusiasts would expect. El Salvador's experiment has clearly shown numerous weaknesses and issues the general population faces when interacting with digital payments."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -1.25%) has been a winning investment this year, with its price up almost 60% in 2023 (as of Sept. 15). Interest from investors is growing after a tumultuous 2022 that saw digital asset prices tank as major businesses in the industry blew up. But it might be a good idea to set your eyes on a new price target, even after the huge gain this year.\n\nIn November 2021, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of nearly $69,000. And while it's 62% off that peak right now, I believe that the world's top cryptocurrency can reach $100,000 within the next five years. By looking at the quantitative and qualitative factors, I think other investors would tend to agree with this forecast.\n\nRunning the numbers\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin's price is roughly $26,000, and its market cap is just over $500 billion. To keep the calculation nice and simple, if the crypto hits $100,000, it would translate to a gain of 300% in the next five years, good for an annualized increase of 32%. That return would surely crush the rise of the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite, but it would match Bitcoin's trailing-five-year return.\n\nIn five years, Bitcoin's market cap would total $2 trillion. That might seem like a lot, but consider that the total value of all the gold on Earth is about $12.5 trillion. As Bitcoin becomes a more legitimized and widely accepted store of value, it should steadily creep up on the total market cap of the popular precious metal. But even in our scenario, Bitcoin would only be worth 16% of gold, a penetration rate that might seem conservative to some bulls.\n\nAt a roughly $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin would still be less valuable than Apple, which is currently worth $2.7 trillion, and Microsoft, with a value of $2.5 trillion. So while a $100,000 price target might seem like a lofty expectation at first glance, it still leaves Bitcoin trailing some of the most successful businesses of all time, a completely reasonable outlook.\n\nWhy should demand rise?\n\nThose calculations make sense and aren't a stretch of the imagination to believe, but the ultimate question remains why more individuals, institutions, or governments would even want to own Bitcoin in greater quantities in the years ahead. It's illuminating to focus on this asset's qualitative characteristics.\n\nAccording to bitinfocharts.com, Bitcoin can only process less than six transactions per second (TPS). This pales in comparison to Visa, the card payments giant, which can theoretically handle 65,000 TPS. Consequently, Bitcoin hasn't shown much promise as a medium of exchange in day-to-day payments. In fact, in developed countries, the existing payments infrastructure works pretty well.\n\nHowever, I believe that Bitcoin's key thesis centers on more parties using it to store their wealth. From a basic supply-and-demand perspective, owning an asset of which there will only ever be 21 million coins seems like a smart decision. As demand rises combined with a fixed supply cap, the price is set to continue climbing higher over time, even though it won't be a smooth ride.\n\nBesides the promise of huge financial returns, Bitcoin can be a worthy store of value when compared to fiat currency. Government-backed money has been devalued over the past century thanks to enormous amounts of money creation, particularly in the past decade or so. This has resulted in the U.S., a country viewed as the world's economic powerhouse, having a whopping $33 trillion in debt outstanding, a figure that has expanded over time and that doesn't include underfunded liabilities like Medicare and Social Security.\n\nI think more market participants, whether individual or institutional investors, corporations, or even governments, are starting to look at Bitcoin as a hedge against something breaking with the traditional financial and monetary system. As more learn about this cryptocurrency, it's not crazy to believe that its price should approach the $100,000 mark. I wouldn't be surprised to see this milestone reached by the end of 2028."

Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies dropped, with Toncoin leading the losers with a slide of over 4%.

U.S. stock futures edged up as investors await the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision this week. Wall Street closed lower on Friday, as mixed economic data in the U.S. moderated the investor\u2019s risk appetite.\n\nBitcoin, Ether dip; selling pressure from FTX liquidation\n\nBitcoin edged down 0.18% in the last 24 hours to US$26,492.52 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong and went up 2.60% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached US$26,840.50 on Friday, the highest price since August 17.\n\nEther dipped 0.87% to US$1,619.94 and traded flat for the week with a 0.18% uptick.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies booked losses in the past 24 hours. Binance\u2019s BNB token was the only exception, rising 0.66% to US$216.23 while adding 1.80% for the week.\n\nDespite the uptick in BNB prices, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange faces mounting regulatory challenges. The firm\u2019s U.S. affiliate Binance.US has laid off one-third of its staff and saw its Chief Executive Officer Brian Shroder leave the company last week, citing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) \u201caggressive attempts to cripple\u201d the crypto industry. The exchange also lost its legal and risk executives last week, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe crypto market is facing pressure from the liquidation of FTX, which plans to sell its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets by the end of 2023. The bankrupt exchange\u2019s top three crypto holdings are Solana (US$1.162 million), Bitcoin (US$560 million) and Ether (US$192 million).\n\nStory continues\n\nFTX said it will gradually sell the holdings with a US$100 million weekly cap to avoid a negative impact on crypto prices, but this limit could expand to US$200 million upon approval from two committees representing FTX customers.\n\n\u201cSales of this size are destined to have an impact,\u201d wrote blockchain research firm K33 on Friday. \u201cEspecially altcoins with limited liquidity are exposed, making it vital for altcoin traders to maintain comprehensive oversight of FTX\u2019s holdings.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. could also be contributing to the underperformance of altcoins, said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cThis is probably led by investors betting on ETFs becoming a thing -at some point in the future \u2014 and not wanting to miss out. Conversely, altcoins that are still at risk of being labelled as \u2018securities\u2019 aren\u2019t benefitting from the same enthusiasm,\u201d said d\u2019Anethan.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.73% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume dropped 12.08% to US$17.53 billion.\n\nU.S. equities futures rise ahead of Fed meeting\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures moved up as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, after Wall Street closed lower on Friday, with Nasdaq Composite leading the losers with a 1.56% slide. The three major U.S. indexes closed the week mixed, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq booking losses while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging up 0.12%.\n\nMost main stock indexes in Asia went lower on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all logged losses, while Japan\u2019s stock market is closed due to a public holiday and will return on Tuesday.\n\nWall Street\u2019s Friday slide was spearheaded by major tech corporations including Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Corp. and Adobe Inc., which all closed the day over 3.5% lower.\n\nTechnology\u2019s\u2019 slide coincided with a Reuters report on Friday stating that TSMC, a Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer that provides chips to companies like Apple, had told its suppliers to delay delivery of high-end chip-making equipment due to concerns over customer demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. economic data on Friday sent mixed messages to the market. The U.S. industrial production rose 0.4% by month in August. Although the reading was held back by a 5% drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts, it still beat the analysts\u2019 expectation of 0.1%.\n\nThe rebound in industrial production followed the August consumer price index (CPI) release last week that showed the core CPI \u2014 the Fed\u2019s favored inflation gauge \u2014 logged its smallest annual increase since September 2021.\n\n\u201cWe really continue to see that growth resilience story, and I think that\u2019s difficult for the market simply because there\u2019s concern about what that could mean both for rates and inflation,\u201d Lisa Erickson, head of public markets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 73% chance for another pause in November, up from 63% on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, it is likely to have a positive impact on higher-risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. Steady interest rates can be indicators of stability, which could encourage investors to seek alternative assets like cryptocurrencies,\u201d said John Stefanidis, chief executive officer and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure decentralized organization Balthazar DAO.\n\nWith most analysts expecting a pause of rate hike in September, all eyes are now on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s remark that will come with the rate hike decision on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWith last week\u2019s higher-than-expected inflation data and the ongoing rise in oil prices, Fed\n\nChair Powell could communicate a relatively hawkish message. However, based on our analysis, we would not expect the market to buy into this for much longer as the inflation trend is still lower,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed report.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s industrial production and retail sales logged an annual increase of 4.5% and 4.6% in August, both accelerating from the previous month and beating the analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the peak pessimism is behind us,\u201d Ding Shuang, chief economist for greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Plc., told Bloomberg on Friday. \u201cAugust\u2019s data indicates that the economy is unlikely to suffer from a persisting, deeper downturn going forward even though there might still be some volatility ahead \u2014 especially if we take into account the policy factor.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

Although the reading was held back by a 5% drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts, it still beat the analysts\u2019 expectation of 0.1%.\n\nThe rebound in industrial production followed the August consumer price index (CPI) release last week that showed the core CPI \u2014 the Fed\u2019s favored inflation gauge \u2014 logged its smallest annual increase since September 2021.\n\n\u201cWe really continue to see that growth resilience story, and I think that\u2019s difficult for the market simply because there\u2019s concern about what that could mean both for rates and inflation,\u201d Lisa Erickson, head of public markets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 73% chance for another pause in November, up from 63% on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, it is likely to have a positive impact on higher-risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. Steady interest rates can be indicators of stability, which could encourage investors to seek alternative assets like cryptocurrencies,\u201d said John Stefanidis, chief executive officer and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure decentralized organization Balthazar DAO.\n\nWith most analysts expecting a pause of rate hike in September, all eyes are now on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s remark that will come with the rate hike decision on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWith last week\u2019s higher-than-expected inflation data and the ongoing rise in oil prices, Fed\n\nChair Powell could communicate a relatively hawkish message. However, based on our analysis, we would not expect the market to buy into this for much longer as the inflation trend is still lower,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed report.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s industrial production and retail sales logged an annual increase of 4.5% and 4.6% in August, both accelerating from the previous month and beating the analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the peak pessimism is behind us,\u201d Ding Shuang, chief economist for greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Plc., told Bloomberg on Friday. \u201cAugust\u2019s data indicates that the economy is unlikely to suffer from a persisting, deeper downturn going forward even though there might still be some volatility ahead \u2014 especially if we take into account the policy factor.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"
