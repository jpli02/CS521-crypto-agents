The US Securities and Exchange Commission has since deferred making a decision on the filing, as well as on several others."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market fell to start the week as traders turned their focus to new inflation data and digested the latest in the SEC's legal battle with Ripple.\n\nBitcoin fell more than 2.8% to trade at $25,004.45, according to Coin Metrics. Ether, whose moves follow those of bitcoin as a \"blue chip\" crypto asset rather than another altcoin, was last trading lower by about 4% at $1,540.10.\n\nBitcoin briefly dipped below $25,000, the first time below that key support level since June.\n\nAltcoins led crypto market declines to start the day, after the Securities and Exchange Commission late Friday argued the need to appeal July's landmark court ruling in its case against Ripple. XRP dropped 5%, according to Coin Metrics, along with the Polygon token. Polkadot 's coin lost 4%, while Binance Coin , Solana's sol token and litecoin were down by about 3% each.\n\n\"It feels like fatigue, and with general pullback in liquidity from market makers any move lower tends to be more volatile,\" said Darius Tabatabai, co-founder of Vertex Protocol. \"That said, the environment is challenging with volumes still low overall and users not returning to crypto in droves as of yet.\""

        "content": "In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box, former PayPal President David Marcus shared his vision for Bitcoin, aiming to transform it into a global payment network. Marcus, who is the CEO of Lightning Network infrastructure company Lightspark, emphasized the importance of expanding Bitcoin's utility beyond just a store of value.\n\nDuring the interview, Marcus highlighted the significant strides Bitcoin has made over the past decade, evolving from an obscure digital currency to a recognized store of value and hedge against inflation. However, he argued that Bitcoin could play a much broader role in the global financial ecosystem.\n\nMarcus proposed that Bitcoin has the potential to become a truly global payment network, similar to PayPal but operating on the decentralized Bitcoin network. He emphasized the need for Bitcoin to evolve further, offering faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions, making it accessible to a broader audience.\n\nDavid Marcus is helping lead the charge to expand Bitcoin's utility in this area. In his current role as CEO of Lightspark, he has committed \"to doing whatever it took\" to realize the full potential of the Bitcoin Lightning Network. \"Because it\u2019s time for the world to have a universal open protocol for payments,\" Marcus continued.\n\nThough, scaling Bitcoin into a massive global payment network is not without challenges. Bitcoin's scalability issues has had its long-standing concerns. However, ongoing technological developments, such as the Lightning Network, aim to address these issues and enhance Bitcoin's capabilities.\n\nRegulatory hurdles also pose a significant challenge. Governments around the world are scrutinizing the Bitcoin industry, with varying degrees of acceptance and regulation. Marcus acknowledged the importance of working with regulators to ensure the compliance and legitimacy of Bitcoin as a global payment solution.\n\nWhile significant challenges lie ahead, including technical and regulatory hurdles, the idea of Bitcoin serving as a decentralized, efficient, and widely accepted means of payment holds the potential to revolutionize the financial industry, making transactions faster and more accessible on a global scale.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets were majorly trading lower in Monday's trade. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 0.20% to $25,808, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was below the 1,650 level.\"The overall crypto market experienced losses, and Bitcoin briefly dipped below $26,000. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is on the verge of a \"death cross,\" where its short-term 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is about to dip below its long-term 200-day SMA, said CoinDCX Research Team.Other top crypto tokens were also trading lower. XRP Dogecoin , Polkadot and Solana declined over 1%.The global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower, around $1.04 trillion, falling 0.32% in the last 24 hours.The total volume in DeFi is currently $1.6 billion, 7.9% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $18.37 billion, which is 90.87% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.The market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $503 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 48.65%, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, BTC volume stood at approximately $8.41 billion, rising 45.94% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin price analysis reveals it is at its lowest since June, struggling around $25,800. Bulls are aiming to break the $26,000 resistance for a potential rally, but a break of $25,500 could lead to further losses,\" Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO of Unocoin, said.Bitcoin has been trading in a relatively tight range around the $26,000 level, and market indicators are sending mixed signals, making it difficult to determine whether the bulls or bears currently have the upper hand. The downsloping moving average suggests a bearish trend, but the positive divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) indicates a potential reduction in selling pressure.Bitcoin continues to trade sideways from $25,500 to $26,500 with low volumes. The bulls are defending the crucial support level of $25,000 (Horizontal Trendline & 50% Fibonacci retracement Level). If it holds and sustains above the support then we may expect the bulls to resume the up move whereas a break below the support will lead to further downfall. $32,500 will be the major hurdle for bulls and to witness a rally BTC needs to break, close and sustain above the resistance level of $32,500.Quick Glance (Source: coinmarketcap.com , data as of 12:40 hours, IST on September 11, 2023)Bitcoin $25,808 -0.20%Ethereum $1,614 -0.71%Tether $0.9997 -0.01% BNB $211 -0.72%XRP $0.4918 -1.69%Cardano $0.2478 -0.64%Dogecoin $0.06165 -0.88%Solana $18.28 -1.42%Polygon $0.5217 -1.24% Litecoin $61.48 -0.64%Polkadot $4.13 -1.33%Tron $0.07921 -0.07%Shiba Inu $0.000007365 -1%(Note: Price change in last 24 hours)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Bitcoin was trading below US$26,000 on Monday afternoon in Asia, while Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses. The market is also under pressure after news that the collapsed FTX crypto exchange may soon liquidate its US$3.4 billion in crypto holdings. Asian equities traded mixed. U.S. futures gained ahead of crucial inflation data release while European bourses gained ahead of the central bank policy meeting later this week.\n\nSee related article: FTX sues LayerZero Labs to recover US$21 million\n\nAll top 10 cryptos drop\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.15% to US$25,811 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 0.56%, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cCurrently, Bitcoin\u2019s price is trading without a clear direction amidst cautious market sentiment. Bitcoin, which leads the entire crypto market, will be influenced by various technical factors in the absence of news and legal decisions related to the cryptocurrency market in the coming week,\u201d Rania Gule, market analyst at multi-asset brokerage firm XS.com told Forkast.\n\n\u201cI believe that the crucial support level of US$24,995 will determine whether Bitcoin\u2019s price goes up or down. A clear and strong break below this level would send Bitcoin toward the very important support level at US$24,000, which would indicate a clear bearish trend reversal. In the worst-case scenario, the selling momentum in this case could push the price down to around US$21,915, which is roughly the mid-March level,\u201d Gule said.\n\nEther, the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token, fell 0.78% to US$1,611 in the last 24 hours, and dropped 1.63% in the last seven days.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s account on X, formerly Twitter, was hacked on Sunday, resulting in losses for some of Buterin\u2019s followers, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. Hackers posted links to a scam non-fungible token (NFT) project on Buterin\u2019s Twitter page, advising users to connect their crypto wallets before withdrawing the funds.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cEthereum price indicators continue to show signals of the ongoing bearish trend, supported by a breach of the trendline that took the price below the critical support level of US$1,687. This paves the way for a potential 27% drop in ETH price. I believe the price could reach a significant level of US$1,200, with intermediate support at US$1,366,\u201d Gule of XS.com pointed out.\n\nThe crypto market is also facing downward pressure from the latest FTX news. The collapsed cryptocurrency exchange is likely to receive approval on Sept. 13 to start liquidating its crypto holdings, according to a tweet from blockchain analysts Whale Alert. After filing for bankruptcy in November last year, the exchange still holds an estimated US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets.\n\nJohn Stefanidis, chief executive of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO, said, \u201cThe recent dip in value of altcoins could be attributed to the anticipated authorisation of the liquidation of assets held by FTX. With a portfolio encompassing billions in cryptocurrency assets, a potential liquidation could significantly influence market values, notably affecting Solana, Aptos, Dogecoin, Matic, TON, and XRP.\u201d\n\nToncoin was the biggest loser, declining 3.38% to US$1.70 in the past 24 hours, and losing 9.96% in the past seven days.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP was the second biggest loser, dropping 2.91% to US$0.4857 on the day and 3.54% on the week. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) submitted a filing last Friday to push the court of the Southern District of New York to appeal its ruling on the agency\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The SEC requested the court to review its prior ruling by Judge Analisa Torres that posed \u201cknotty legal problems,\u201d according to the filing. In July, a summary judgment by Judge Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws, but sales on public exchanges to retail investors did not.\n\nRipple Labs also announced that it will acquire Nevada-based crypto infrastructure startup Fortress Trust, giving Ripple a regulatory license in the state of Nevada.\n\nElsewhere, the Group of 20 (G20) meeting under India\u2019s presidency, said during the weekend that member countries will work together to develop a coordinated global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, cross-border cooperation and information sharing.\n\n\u201cCrypto assets and how regulation can be put in place \u2013 we contributed to a roadmap so [that] over the next month progress can be made in that area,\u201d Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of International Monetary Fund said at the conclusion of G20 leaders summit in India\u2019s capital New Delhi on Sunday.\n\nCongratulations to India on a successful #G20 presidency. Its theme of \"one earth, one family, one future\" resonated with global leaders, who reached an important consensus on ways to address the global challenges confronting us. My takeaways from \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3's successful @g20org summit. \u2014 Kristalina Georgieva (@KGeorgieva) September 10, 2023\n\nHowever, one of the key challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry globally is the delay in implementing these recommendations at a national level, according to Caroline Bowler, chief executive of Australian digital asset exchange BTC Markets.\n\n\u201cWhile international organizations are setting the framework for a harmonized regulatory environment, it is imperative that governments and regulatory authorities act promptly to translate these guidelines into actionable regulations. Delayed implementation could hinder the industry\u2019s growth, create uncertainty, and potentially leave investors and consumers exposed to risks,\u201d Bowler said in an emailed statement on Monday.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization dropped 0.54% to US$1.03 trillion, while market volume gained 36.82% to US$20.63 billion.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume, transactions drop\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.85% to 2,119 in 24 hours to 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, dropping 3.53% on the week, with Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon indexes also declining.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume dropped 4.08% to US$8,757,370 in the past 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data. NFT transactions dropped over 10% at the same time.\n\n\u201cAs we head into the slowest months of the year one has to wonder how low we can really go, and if we can fall to Feb. 2021 levels where we saw US$35-50 million in sales,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nAmong blockchains, Ethereum topped the rankings by sales volume, which rose 2.67% to US$4.7 million. Mythos and Polygon networks ranked second and third respectively.\n\nAmong collections, Mythos-based DMarket topped rankings although its sales volume fell 7.76% to US$1,012,238 in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cFootball NFTs were hot with the kickoff of the NFL season. Both DraftKings with their fantasy football NFTs and NFL All Day with their pure collectibles saw millions in sales over the past seven days,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nSales of Polygon-based DraftKings gained 45.96% to US$579,756, ranking it the third biggest collection by sales volume.\n\nAsian equities mixed; U.S. futures, European bourses gain\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden in Vietnam on Sept. 11. Investors are looking forward to latest U.S. inflation data due for release later this week. Image: President Biden/Twitter\n\nMajor Asian stock markets traded mixed on Monday as investors await the latest U.S. inflation data due for release later this week. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component Index, as well as South Korea\u2019s Kospi gained. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index dropped at the end of trading hours.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for August will be released on Wednesday. Analysts expect the inflation gauge to rise 3.8% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.\n\nA recent rise in oil prices and stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. services recorded last week have fueled inflation concerns in the U.S., Reuters reported.\n\nThe CPI prediction of 3.8% is still higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term goal of bringing the annual inflation below 2%. The Fed last raised the interest rate in July to between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest since early 2001.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened as of 8 p.m. in Hong Kong on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures were all in the green.\n\nIndia\u2019s benchmark index Sensex rose 0.79% at the close of trading hours on Monday.\n\nEuropean bourses \u2013 the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 \u2013 gained on Monday. Investors are looking forward to the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB\u2019s) policy meeting outcome on Thursday, which is expected to indicate whether the central bank will increase interest rates further. ECB policymakers are divided over raising rates again, amid slowing economic activity and persistent inflation that remains above the 2% target.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot get yourself to hike in September, the case will not be stronger in October as economic data will likely worsen, and inflation in September will come lower quite a bit,\u201d said UBS chief European economist Reinhard Cluse, who expects a 25 basis-point increase, according to a Reuters report.\n\n(updates with equities section.)"
