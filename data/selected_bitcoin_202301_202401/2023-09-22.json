        "content": "The Federal Reserve's hold on the bitcoin price may be back in play following the central bank's latest policy update. Bitcoin's price action was generally unchanged this week, even after the Fed meeting, where the central bank hit pause on rate hikes but indicated it could hold rates at higher levels for longer than previously thought. The cryptocurrency is currently at the lower end of the tight range it has been stuck at for months between $25,000 and $30,000. However, unlike the March and June rallies that followed oversold conditions, bitcoin has been trading sideways since its last major drop . \"This move in rates is impacting long duration, speculative assets and bitcoin definitely falls into that camp,\" Rob Ginsberg, an analyst at Wolfe Research, told CNBC. \"Oversold conditions are a great indicator that you should rebound \u2014 you get concerned when [prices] don't respond.\" BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin has struggled to rebound from its Aug. 17 drop \"[When] rates break out to new cycle highs \u2026 it wouldn't surprise me if we take out [the] $25,000 support level \u2026 and then something starts to break in the system,\" he added. \"That's when the Fed pivots and that's when you see a violent rotation back into risk.\" Last year's crypto winter was unlike others before it in that the Federal Reserve and its inflation fighting rate hiking campaign had perhaps the biggest influence over bitcoin's price action. Bitcoin is now up about 60% in 2023, but the long-anticipated developments in regulation and the bitcoin exchange-traded fund space that were expected to be positive catalysts haven't propelled prices higher. Apathetic investors are on pause as they await next moves from the Fed. If bitcoin breaks above $28,000, it could continue to as high as $32,000 in the short term, Ginsberg said. However, he said it's not very likely as the market's recent deterioration would have to be a head fake. If bitcoin takes out the $25,000 support level, it could fall further still to between $20,000 and $21,000, according to Ginsberg. \"Real rates are moving higher and they're breaking out to cycle highs,\" he said. \"That to me is still the biggest headwind for speculation and crypto in particular. So you need to see that breakeven and work lower to get people to come back into that part of the market.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners' Digital Power Network Shows Off Industry Consolidation - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Political advocacy group Digital Power Network launches, representing 50% of total US hash rate. A look at consolidation in the mining industry before next halving.\n\nBy Landon Manning\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce, a political advocacy group dedicated to Bitcoin and the crypto sphere, has turned heads with an announcement that the members of its new mining-specific group represent more than 50 percent of the entire US Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce has existed since 2014, with its own registered committee able to make contributions to political candidates. Although its existence represented a significant step for the growing relationship between a hostile political establishment and the new economic world of cryptocurrency, its footprint remained relatively small for most of its existence. Campaign disclosures have only recorded $2700 in donations for any Congressional races, in 2017, but in March 2023 they partnered with a Texas Representative to introduce a bill supporting proof-of-work mining.\n\nThe Chamber\u2019s work in getting this bill off the ground has apparently been quite useful in building up industry connections, because it made a major splash in late September by announcing the formation of a new working group: the Digital Power Network. With a mission statement of promoting the interests of American miners, the Network plans to partner with legislators to support fair and straightforward regulation over many aspects of the crypto industry. This is all well and good, but this new group has some real heft to back up these goals: its various members collectively represent more than half of the nation\u2019s entire Bitcoin hash rate.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why a group like this is so necessary, according to Perianne Boring, founder and CEO of the Chamber for Digital Commerce. She said in interviews that \u201cdigital asset mining, at its heart, is both an energy and national security matter, and we firmly believe that Bitcoin will drive policies that unite all political stakeholders to advance this crucial industry in the United States.\u201d The various representatives in the Digital Power Network seem to share her enthusiasm, with Riot Blockchain CEO Jason Les claiming that \u201cat its core, Bitcoin mining converts stranded, low-cost energy into a valuable commodity, which is why our industry has tremendous potential\u201d and Marathon CEO Fred Thiel declaring the group \u201cimportant for ensuring that the perspectives of digital energy stakeholders are considered.\u201d These two firms alone are some of the most productive Bitcoin miners in the United States.\n\nA development like this in the crypto mining world is vitally important not only for the possibilities of the group, but also for the state of the industry that such a group can even exist. Among these companies, one topic has been growing and growing in everyone\u2019s mind: the upcoming Bitcoin halving. A planned occurrence within the Bitcoin blockchain, halvings occur every few years to ensure a stable taper in the supply of available bitcoins, and the next one is coming soon. After some time around April 2024, the same exact amount of work from mining rigs will produce half as much Bitcoin, and it will be up to the miners to figure out how to keep their businesses profitable.\n\nSeveral strategies are immediately apparent for these companies: for one, most obviously, efficient equipment is key. Especially with growing concerns of the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, the halving will make it simply unviable to actually use outdated equipment at large scale. Similarly, firms have been encouraged to diversify investments, build up cash reserves and several other tactics that point to one overall strategy: consolidation of capital. Smaller firms that are unable to remain functional after the halving, to buy new equipment or stay in business without cash flow, will simply be pushed out, and the survivors will have a larger share of the new pie to split amongst themselves.\n\nThis consolidation is already evident from the emergence of the Digital Power Network. Their site lists 11 major players as members of this miner advocacy group, and their consortium represents most of the US Bitcoin mining industry. It is certain that every one of these firms has given a great deal of thought to the upcoming halving, and in all likelihood this group is part of their long-term plans. And even outside of these major players, signs of this increasing consolidation are ubiquitous. For example, Hut 8, a Canadian bitcoin mining company, has received approval from the Supreme Court of British Columbia on September 18th, authorizing them to carry out a merger with US Bitcoin Corp. This new company will be chartered within the United States, and upon incorporation the new \u201cHut 8 Corp\u201d will immediately become one of the largest mining companies in the nation. Hut 8\u2019s stock price went up by 6.5% after gaining this approval, showing off the market\u2019s confidence.\n\nBetween these firms that represent such a large chunk of the Bitcoin mining industry, and new mining giants forming by merger outside of the Digital Power Network, it seems clear that the consolidation of industry is a serious tactic for these companies to survive in a wildly competitive mining ecosystem. With all these giants, after all, how many smaller companies exist to make up the remaining share of the pie? And more to the point, how many of those companies will continue to exist a year from now? The world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is wide in scale and chaotic in temperament; it requires a deft hand to stay afloat. Yet, with moves like these, it seems clear that the miners have full confidence in their abilities to thrive, and this attitude is representative of the whole crypto scene. With an innovative and industrious mindset, Bitcoin has fostered a community of movers and shakers that can propel decentralized currency into the future.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
