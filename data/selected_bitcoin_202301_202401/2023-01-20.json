        "title": "Crypto Latest: Bitcoin Increases, Three Arrows Founders Want Startup Funding - Bloomberg",
        "content": "Listen to Bloomberg Crypto on the iHeartRadio App, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.\n\nIs crypto back? That\u2019s one question Bloomberg editors and reporters discuss in another This Week in Crypto episode. Already, the year is packed with digital asset action. Bitcoin is up nearly 30% so far in 2023. Lots of smaller tokens have climbed even more than that. Suddenly, crypto enthusiasts are uttering words like FOMO \u2014 Fear of Missing Out \u2014 again.\n\n\n\nThen there are some crypto comebacks happening. Or, at least, attempted comebacks. The guys behind 3AC, Three Arrows Capital, the cryptocurrency hedge fund credited in some circles with launching the crypto winter, are seeking funding for a new startup. Crypto Twitter has not been kind."

Bitcoin, he declared, is a \u201chyped-up fraud\u201d; it\u2019s a \u201cpet rock.\u201d\n\nTell us what you really think, Mr. Dimon.\n\nActually, Dimon seems to share the same view of Bitcoin that I and many other economists have had all along: The digital \u201ccurrency\u201d isn\u2019t really a currency. That is, it can\u2019t be used as a medium of exchange \u2014 there are very few things you can buy directly with Bitcoin \u2014 and it isn\u2019t a stable store of value with reasonably predictable future purchasing power. So it\u2019s basically useless \u2014 as Dimon says, it\u2019s a pet rock.\n\nHowever, one concern that has long nagged at sophisticated crypto skeptics is that most of the negative things one could say about Bitcoin can also be said about gold. You can\u2019t buy groceries, or even a house, with gold ingots. And historically the purchasing power of gold has been highly unstable.
