        "content": "Tether to Start Mining Bitcoin in Uruguay\n\nTether to Start Mining Bitcoin in Uruguay\n\nTether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin in the market, USDT, has announced its entry into the energy sector with a focus on renewable energy production for Bitcoin mining. The company said it will launch a Bitcoin mining arm in Uruguay, a country that generates 94% of its electricity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. On top of that, the stablecoin issuer said it will also invest in Uruguay's energy production industry and hire more team members to support its expansion.\n\nThe move is part of Tether's treasury management strategy, which involves investing up to 15% of its net profit in Bitcoin. Previously, Tether revealed it held about $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, which accounts for around 2% of its total reserves. Tether said it aims to minimize the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining through the use of renewable energy sources, while also adding to the security of the Bitcoin network."

        "content": "A picture taken in London shows gold-plated souvenir cryptocurrency tether, bitcoin and ethereum coins arranged beside a screen displaying a trading chart, May 8, 2022.\n\nCryptocurrency giant Tether is setting up a bitcoin mining operation in Uruguay using renewable energy, as the company looks to diversify the revenue mix to support its USDT stablecoin.\n\nThe company said Tuesday that it plans to invest its resources into renewable energy production, marking its first foray into the energy sector.\n\nTether added it is also on the hunt for \"experts in the area\" to support its expansion into the renewable energy space. Mining bitcoin is notoriously power-intensive, relying on a distributed network of computers around the world to verify that transactions are legitimate and release new coins into circulation.\n\n\"By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay's renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining,\" said Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether.\n\n\"Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every Bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Tether said it would shift its treasury management strategy to start investing a portion of its net profit in bitcoin.\n\nThe company committed to use up to 15% of its net profit to purchase bitcoin, mimicking strategies from businesses such as Tesla and MicroStrategy ."

        "title": "Bitcoin: crypto backers hope scarcity can solve everything - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe days of Bill Clinton appearing on stage at cryptocurrency conferences and Matt Damon starring in crypto exchange ads are long gone. Speculative mania has given way to more sober reflection. In the US, the energy usage of miners is under fresh attack. The White House has suggested that mining companies pay tax equal to 30 per cent of the cost of electricity they use.\n\nDespite this, the price of bitcoin has climbed 67 per cent this year, exceeding $30,000 in April before falling back. Ethereum, the second- largest digital token, is following the same trajectory. It may be less than half its high point, but the pause on interest rate rises has lifted bitcoin\u2019s price. A technical event known as the halving could drive it higher still.\n\nThere will only ever be 21mn bitcoin in circulation. Every four years, rewards for mining bitcoin are chopped in half. Right now, miners receive 6.25 bitcoin for verifying a new block of transactions on the blockchain. Next year this will drop to 3.125. Eventually the reward will be cut to $0. The lead-up to previous halvings has coincided with bitcoin price rises.\n\nIt is possible, however, that dwindling enthusiasm for the crypto industry will damp the halving\u2019s impact. Venture capital funding for crypto and blockchain start-ups dropped 80 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2022, according to data from PitchBook. Excitement around artificial intelligence that has lifted prices in semiconductor companies and other tech stocks has not extended to crypto companies. Regulator warnings have made banks more skittish about holding their assets after FTX\u2019s failure.\n\nBitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis as a decentralised alternative. But the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this year did not trigger renewed conversion to bitcoin. Lack of transparency remains a problem. So does criminal activity. Price moves dictated by technical mechanisms that create scarcity show how far the digital asset is from ushering in a brand-new financial system."

        "content": "A visual representation of the digital cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is on display in front of the Bitcoin course's graph in Paris, February 9, 2021.\n\nBitcoin briefly recovered the $28,000 level over the extended holiday weekend for the first time since the start of the month, after the Biden administration reached a tentative deal with Republican lawmakers to address the U.S. debt ceiling.\n\nThe crypto market leader was up less than 1% Tuesday at $27,868.99, according to Coin Metrics. Ether added about the same amount to trade at $1,908.17.\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin rose as high as $28,461.45, while ether reached a high of $1,928.16.\n\nThe cryptocurrencies began climbing Saturday evening after House Republicans reached a tentative deal with the White House to raise the nation's debt ceiling and avoid a default. Congress is set to vote on the legislation as early as Wednesday.\n\n\"The past few days have shown strong volatility as BTC dropped to the lowest trading price of about $25,800 Wednesday due to investors' fear concerning [the] U.S. reaching the debt ceiling,\" said Matteo Greco, research analyst at investment firm Fineqia International.\n\nBitcoin and ether roared higher the following day.\n\n\"However \u2026 This means that, in the mid-term, money is removed from more risky assets to buy government bonds. The consequence could be an additional slowdown in volumes and liquidity for the stock and digital asset markets, with a potential negative impact on prices,\" Greco added.\n\nAs the debt ceiling negotiations weighed on crypto investors last week, the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting also showed central bank officials are divided on where to go with interest rate hikes.\n\nWith both of those factors, bitcoin has started behaving like a risk asset again. Its correlation with gold has retraced from this year's all-time highs\n\nBitcoin is now testing its March resistance level of about $28,800, said Yuya Hasegawa, a crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank.\n\nBitcoin and ether are on pace for their worst month since November, down 5% and up 0.1%, respectively. Bitcoin is on pace for its first negative month in 2023.\n\nFor the quarter, bitcoin is down almost 2%, after finishing the first quarter up 71%. Ether is up 4.3%, after it posted a 52% gain in Q1."
