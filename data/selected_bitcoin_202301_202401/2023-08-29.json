        "content": "Grayscale Investments LLC won a key legal fight in its push to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, bringing the crypto industry to the precipice of tapping billions of dollars from everyday investors.\n\nThe firm\u2019s court victory over the US Securities and Exchange Commission in a three-judge appeals panel in Washington represents a watershed moment for the largest cryptocurrency. Advocates say an ETF based on spot Bitcoin prices would result in a gush of retail cash."

        "content": "There are two ways to run a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund:\n\nIt seems to me that Approach 1 is, you know, fine and interesting, but Approach 2 is strictly better: It\u2019s simpler for the ETF manager to do, simpler for investors to understand, and has less friction and tracking error. My one quibble with Approach 2 is that you really do have to keep the Bitcoins somewhere safe, and there is a long, long, long history of people in crypto finding exciting new ways to lose their cryptocurrency, but I think that in 2023 \u201cbuy Bitcoins and don\u2019t lose them\u201d is the sort of thing that you can expect a regulated financial institution to manage."

Circuit ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission had improperly denied an application from the asset manager, Grayscale Investments, to create a Bitcoin exchange traded fund, calling the rejection \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nGrayscale is seeking to create the fund to give investors exposure to the cryptocurrency via traditional brokers and markets rather than digital asset exchanges.\n\nThe S.E.C. has already approved funds that bet on Bitcoin futures, or price fluctuations in the cryptocurrency, but it has denied numerous requests for an E.T.F. holding Bitcoin itself, arguing that the markets are subject to fraud and manipulation."

        "content": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has paved the way for bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nOn Tuesday, the court sided with Grayscale in a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission which had denied the company's application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF. The decision could impact other companies that want to create bitcoin ETFs, like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would be traded through a traditional stock exchange, although the bitcoin would be held by a brokerage, and would allow investors to gain exposure to the world's biggest cryptocurrency without having to own the coin themselves. Many crypto bulls believe that approval of a spot bitcoin ETF will lead to more mainstream institutional adoption.\n\nBitcoin , ether and other major cap crypto coins surged on the news, and Coinbase , which is listed as the custodian partner in multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications, was up more than 14% on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETP,\" the court said, referring to exchange-traded products. \"In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful.\"\n\nGrayscale Investments, which manages the world's biggest crypto fund, initiated its lawsuit against the SEC in June 2022 after the agency rejected its application to turn its flagship bitcoin fund, better known by its ticker GBTC, into an ETF. The company decided to pursue the ETF, which would be backed by bitcoin rather than bitcoin derivatives, after the SEC approved ProShares' futures-based bitcoin ETF in October 2021.\n\nThe ruling faced multiple delays but the SEC ultimately rejected the application last summer, citing failure by Grayscale to answer questions related to concerns about possible market manipulation and investor protections.\n\n\"We are reviewing the court's decision to determine next steps,\" the SEC said in a statement.\n\nA spokeswoman for Grayscale called Tuesday's ruling \"a monumental step forward for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper.\"\n\n\"The Grayscale team and our legal advisors are actively reviewing the details outlined in the Court's opinion and will be pursuing next steps with the SEC. We will share more information as soon as practicable,\" continued the written statement."

        "title": "Bitcoin rallies more than 7% as court sides with Grayscale over the SEC in crypto ETF case - CNBC",
        "content": "Bitcoin jumped 7.15% following the ruling to $27,851.82, according to Coin Metrics. The move lifted cryptocurrencies broadly as well as crypto equities higher.\n\nThe price of bitcoin surged Tuesday after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission was wrong to deny crypto investment giant Grayscale permission to convert its popular bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nGrayscale's lawsuit against the SEC has been closely watched by investors and other industry participants as a key catalyst that would shake up a market marred by low volatility and liquidity. Earlier this month, bitcoin trading volatility fell to its lowest level in more than four years as investors had been waiting on the sidelines for more regulatory clarity on crypto activity \u2013 whether through new legislation out of Congress or through the ability to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nSeveral bitcoin futures ETFs have already been approved in the U.S.\n\n\"The denial of Grayscale's proposal was arbitrary and capricious ... The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETP,\" the court said in the ruling. \"In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition for review and vacate the Commission's order.\"\n\nTuesday's ruling may increase the chances that the SEC will approve other bitcoin ETF applications \u2013 including that of BlackRock , whose filing in late June drove one of bitcoin's big rallies this year, as well as Fidelity , WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco and others. A U.S. bitcoin ETF would provide a way to get exposure to bitcoin without having to hold it, which would invite retail and institutional investors as well as wealth managers into the market.\n\nA spokesperson for the SEC said it's \"reviewing the court's decision to determine next steps.\"\n\n\"Today's decision reaffirms that a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is a matter of when, not if,\" said Steve Kurz, global head of asset management at Galaxy, which filed with Invesco for its bitcoin ETF. \"In order for digital assets to continue to flourish, they must be accessible to all investors. We believe that the ETF structure can enable greater access to and transparency across cryptocurrency investing, and truly help further democratize the asset class.\"\n\nThe ruling also comes as a relief to many crypto market participants who have been frustrated by the SEC, particularly under Chair Gary Gensler, and its insistence on regulating by enforcement. The crypto industry has long sought out clarity in rules businesses can play by to establish and build long-lasting, compliant companies. The U.S. regulatory crackdown on crypto in 2023 \u2014 which includes SEC enforcements and a lawsuit against the biggest U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase \u2014 has been a dark cloud over the market.\n\nGrayscale initiated its lawsuit against the SEC in June 2022 after the agency rejected its application to turn its bitcoin trust, better known by its ticker GBTC, into an ETF. The company decided to pursue the ETF, which would be backed by bitcoin rather than bitcoin derivatives, after the SEC approved ProShares' futures-based bitcoin ETF in October 2021.\n\nThe ruling faced multiple delays but the SEC ultimately rejected the application last summer, citing failure by Grayscale to answer questions related to concerns about market manipulation and investor protections.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust itself jumped 16.95%.\n\n\u2014CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed reporting."
