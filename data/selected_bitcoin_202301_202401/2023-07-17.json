        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accepted asset manager BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), signalling a major step for the potential launch of the country\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSee related article: BlackRock files for spot Bitcoin ETF, taps Coinbase as custodian\n\nFast facts\n\nOn July 13, the SEC added BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application to its list of proposed rulemaking filings for the Nasdaq stock market \u2014 a move that signals the regulatory body\u2019s intent to take the application seriously.\n\nGiven BlackRock\u2019s global stature in the asset management industry, that signal is considered significant as a potential indicator of greater institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to come.\n\nThe move follows BlackRock\u2019s filing of an amended Bitcoin ETF application in late June. SEC officials reportedly expressed concern that the original ETF applications filed by BlackRock and other asset managers were not sufficiently comprehensive.\n\nTo convince the regulators, BlackRock has added a \u201csurveillance-sharing\u201d agreement with U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase to its updated application. Competitors including Ark Invest, Fidelity Investments and others are also filing similar amendments to their respective Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nOn July 14, the day after the BlackRock decision, the SEC also added the Bitcoin ETF applications of WisdomTree, VanEck, Fidelity and Invesco Galaxy to its docket.\n\nBlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager with over US$9.4 trillion in assets. The firm filed for its first spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, fueling optimism for further institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF allows customers to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the token, and can be traded on traditional stock markets. The U.S. SEC approved the nation\u2019s first Bitcoin futures ETF on June 23, but is so far yet to give the green light to a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nElsewhere, Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 proposed by Jacobi Asset Management \u2014 is expected to be publicly listed this month. That follows a 12-month delay from the initially planned date, according to reporting by the Financial Times.\n\nSee related article: US SEC says Bitcoin ETF applications inadequate: WSJ"

        "title": "Standard Chartered Ups 2024 Bitcoin Price Prediction To $120000 - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nStandard Chartered, one of the largest banks in the United Kingdom, has made ripples in the financial world by predicting that the bitcoin price could reach $50,000 by the end of the year, and $120,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nStandard Chartered serves a multinational base of individual and corporate clients from its headquarters in London and although it does not conduct retail banking in the U.K., its multibillion dollar operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East make it one of the most influential financial firms in the world.\n\nAnd this prominent role in the global financial system is what makes it particularly interesting that Standard Chartered made such a bullish prediction for bitcoin earlier this month. Citing recent market activity and subsequent impacts on miners, a report published by the bank suggested that bitcoin is now set for a meteoric rise, bringing its price up to $120,000 by the end of next year.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s optimistic outlook is being bolstered by Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate, the amount of computing power being applied to secure the network by miners and an indicator of the network\u2019s strength, which recently hit an all-time high. This latest prediction upped the bank\u2019s previous call that the bitcoin price would reach $100,000 in 2024, an increase motivated by a more optimistic outlook for miner profitability.\n\n\u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\u201d explained Standard Chartered FX analyst Geoff Kendrick.\n\nThe bitcoin price has already risen in value by some 80% since the beginning of 2023. If it jumps up to $50,000 as expected by the bank, Kendrick added that \u201cOver a year, that would reduce miner selling from 328,500 to a range of 65,700 to 98,550 \u2014 a reduction in net BTC supply of roughly 250,000 bitcoins a year.\u201d\n\nThe mining ecosystem is not the only reason to be bullish on bitcoin, however. The strong possibility of an approved spot Bitcoin ETF on the horizon could usher in a new wave of institutional investors.\n\nIt might seem overly optimistic to claim that bitcoin\u2019s price will end up quadrupling over the next year and a half, even with its historic volatility. But there are clear reasons why such a large bank has such confidence in Bitcoin. Hard data shows that the mining industry is thawing from \u201ccrypto winter\u201d to become stronger than ever, regulatory approval years in the making appears imminent and BTC has once again emerged from a cycle low with strong momentum.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "DUBAI, UAE / ACCESSWIRE / July 18, 2023 / Unlike the halving of Litecoin, which had no substantial effect on its price in the past, the halving of Bitcoin is currently one of the major expected events in the crypto market. Bitcoin is set to undergo a periodic halving in 2024.* BITmarkets has identified bitcoin halving as one of the major events for the crypto trading community. The trader's perspective on the phenomenon of halving is a part of 2023 Mid-Year Crypto Outlook.\n\nBITmarkets, Tuesday, July 18, 2023, Press release picture\n\n\"After the challenges of 2022, the current year seems to have blown a wind of change indeed. The possibility of cryptocurrencies aiming back towards the highs of 2021 during the upcoming year can be realistic, given revitalizing market conditions. Of course, there are risks, or in other words, obstacles along the way, but current market conditions may indicate a rather prosperous development and outcome for cryptocurrencies in the near future,\" says Peter Sumer, COO of BITmarkets, on the findings of the Outlook study.\n\n2023 has started strong for cryptocurrencies and other financial market assets, combatting headwinds with fierce force and retaining hard-earned value. Among the trends of the current year and the ones to follow are several: more regulation, rise of central bank digital currencies, popularization of DeFi, more investments into stablecoins and the revitalization or deterioration of NFTs.\n\nIdentity verification strictness may increase as more cyberattacks and hacks have been detected in recent times. Increased regulation is intended to safeguard the funds and data of crypto traders. This can come in the form of increasing scrutiny of identity verification, which can bolster the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks set in place.\n\nOther legal measures such as passing new laws that tackle money laundering and necessitating accurate & recurrent corporate reporting can achieve higher consumer protection.\n\nMore information on trends and upcoming events in the world of crypto traders is to be found in the 2023 Mid-Year Crypto Outlook: Crypto Trends to Watch & 2024 Bitcoin Halving, a study by BITmarkets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBITmarkets is a crypto exchange that operates in more than 15 languages and offers 24/7 support in local languages. Besides spot trading, clients are enabled to unique futures options with 100+ cryptocurrencies. For more information see https://bitmarkets.com/en\n\nBITmarkets Spot Trading Services are provided to you by UAB BITmarkets, which is an authorized virtual currency exchange and depository virtual currency wallet operator in Lithuania operating under the licence no: 306062346, supervised by the Financial Crime Investigation Service and acting under the trademark BITmarkets.\n\n* In 2024, Bitcoin is set to undergo a periodic halving event, which occurs every 4 years or 210,000 blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. The initial block reward for BTC was 50 BTC, while the current block reward stands at 6.25 BTC, and the next block reward will be 3.125 BTC, and the halving continues. This event, programmed into the Bitcoin code, slows down the rate at which Bitcoins are mined and generated. The main incentive behind this action is to limit the total supply of BTC, which shall be maxed out at 21,000,000 BTC.\n\nPR Contact:\n\nZEX PR WIRE\n\ninfo@zexprwire.com\n\nSOURCE: BITmarkets\n\n\n\n\n\nView source version on accesswire.com:\n\nhttps://www.accesswire.com/768435/Bitcoin-Halving-Amongst-Major-Events-to-Watch-in-the-Crypto-Market\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether inched down during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, while all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were mixed. XRP continued its rally after XRP issuer Ripple\u2019s favorable ruling last week in its lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors were also upbeat after the SEC accepted BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications for review.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin breaches US$31,195 following Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nBitcoin, Ether slip but remain above key levels, XRP leads gains\n\nBitcoin was little changed during the Asia trading day, holding at US$30,321 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nEther inched down 0.15% during afternoon trading in Asia, to change hands at US$1,931, holding above US$1,900 since Thursday.\n\nThe XRP token was the day\u2019s biggest gainer, rising 4.22% to US$0.7483. The token rallied 59.67% on the week after U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled Thursday that Ripple Labs\u2019 programmatic sales of its XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as financial securities.\n\nAdding to positive investor sentiment, the SEC has accepted asset manager BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF for review. This signals the SEC\u2019s intent to seriously consider the ETF application.\n\n\u201cAn approved ETF could be the catalyst that provides an efficient and regulated way for institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Such approval could potentially bring significant inflows of institutional capital into the market, increasing liquidity and driving up prices,\u201d Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cIt would signal a maturing and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, instilling confidence in both retail and institutional investors. It would remove some of the perceived barriers to entry, making it easier for individuals and institutions to participate in the market.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.10% to US$1.21 trillion and market volume increased 3.97% to US$25.93 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales rise, Ethereum NFT sales lose momentum\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.25% to 2,729.89 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 0.48% during the week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales increased 73.17% to US$1.59 million, as sales for Uncategorized Ordinals rallied 99.29% to US$627,110.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell 13.67% to US$11.6 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 1.05% to US$706,564. Last Friday, Yuga Labs, the company behind The Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, announced that it will hold ApeFest, an event to celebrate the firm\u2019s NFT collections, in Hong Kong, at the beginning of November.\n\nOn Ethereum, sales for the Captainz collection also rose 19.36% to US$548,312.\n\n\u201cNFTs continue to ride the wave of positive news and positive prices in crypto. However, we\u2019re not seeing any noteworthy gains in projects and instead, most of the big names are still down for the past seven days,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cTraders are hurting for liquidity and when we see volume it\u2019s often paired with decreasing prices.\u201d\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast ETH NFT Composite was the only one in the red, falling 0.13% to 928.58 points.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures fall\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities weakened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, the Shenzhen Component Index and Shanghai Composite all posting declines.\n\nHong Kong markets halted trading in both securities and derivatives markets on Monday, amid a warning over Typhoon Talim. While the storm has not caused any major damage, authorities warned that it could lead to flooding.\n\nInvestor sentiment turned negative after data showed that China\u2019s economy grew 6.3% in the second quarter, below expected expansion of 7.3%. Retail sales also missed preliminary forecasts. Investors are hoping for more stimulus measures from Beijing to bolster the mainland\u2019s post-pandemic recovery.\n\nU.S. stock futures also fell during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, with the S&P 500 futures index, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all weakening.\n\nThis week, investors are anticipating earnings reports from major banks like Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Companies like Tesla, Netflix and United Airlines are also releasing their earnings reports.\n\nSee related article: EU publishes draft bill for digital euro and cash payments\n\nUpdates with equities section"

        "content": "Bitcoin briefly fell under US$30,000 in early Tuesday morning trading in Asia before recovering back above that support line. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies declined, with Solana leading the losers. Polygon\u2019s Matic was the exception, adding more than one percent at one point. NFT trading slumped and U.S. stock futures traded flat after gains on Monday. The week ahead brings rafts of earnings, including from major U.S. banks on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin, Ether slip\n\nBitcoin lost 0.55% over the last 24 hours to US$30,160.39 as of 06:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, falling 0.62% for the week, according to data from CryptoMarketCap. The token dipped to US$29,685.78 at one point in early morning Asia trading on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOn a weekly timeframe, Bitcoin is trending up on the highs and lows, but down on the close and open,\u201d said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based online brokerage FxPro. \u201cFailure to rally from current levels opens the door for a correction to the $27,000 area if risk-off sentiment intensifies later in the week.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency with a current market capitalization of US$586 billion has attracted bouts of buying interest following several filings for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in June, including one by the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock.\n\nOn July 13, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally accepted the Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, WisdomTree, VanEck and others for review.\n\nWhen measured by investments in crypto-focused funds, Bitcoin has seen inflows of US$140 million in the last week, or 99% of the total invested in such funds, according to asset manager CoinShares. A total US$742 million was invested in crypto funds over the last 4 weeks, the largest since the final quarter of 2021, according to CoinShares data.\n\nEther declined by 1.07% to US$1,913.56, but was still holding gains of 2.03% in the last seven days. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were in the red, though Polygon\u2019s Matic added to weekly gains of 5.99%. Matic rose 0.37% to US$0.781 in early trade and gained further later in the morning.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast Thursday, Polygon Labs announced a new, revamped version of its native token named Pol, which the company claims will be more secure, scalable and frictionless.\n\nSolana was the biggest loser among the top 10 falling 3.26% to US$26.74. However that could be from profit-taking as the token has jumped 25.55% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 0.49% in the past 24 hours to US$1.21 trillion, while trading volume rose 42.52% to US$35.54 billion.\n\nNFTs in \u201csubstantial slowdown\u201d\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.27% in the past 24 hours to 2,719.10 as of 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 0.43% for the week.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index is down following a very slow day of trading,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cFocusing on Ethereum trading we see 14,006 total transactions on Sunday, which is the lowest in almost 2 years, when we saw 13,560 transactions on July 24, 2021.\u201d\n\nPetscher said the number of unique buyers fell under 10,000, also a substantial slowdown in the NFT market.\n\nForkast\u2019s NFT market indices measuring the performance on Ethereum, Solana and Cardano blockchains rose, while the Polygon index dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume gained 1.45% to US$18.51 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum-based art NFT collection Opepen Edition topped the trading volume rankings on CryptoSlam, rising 2.93% in the last 24 hours to US$782,290.\n\n\u201cOpepen is an interesting hybrid project that merges conceptual art into easy to digest profile pictures,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cInfluencers and even large Web3 entities like OpenSea and Rarible are getting in on the fun by changing their profile pictures to an Opepen that matches their brand.\u201d\n\nImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained Cards, the collection of NFTs used in Immutable\u2019s trading card game of the same name, placed second in 24-hour trading volume, despite falling 2.19% to US$675,685.\n\nElsewhere, NFL Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said on Twitter Monday that he will launch his second line of NFTs inspired by his football career. The new collectibles are expected in September, according to Decrypt.\n\nU.S. stock futures little changed, Asia markets lower\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after all three major U.S. indexes gained during regular trading on Monday.\n\nStocks in main Asia markets fell back after China on Monday reported lower-than-expected economic growth of 6.3% for Q2. The Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 all posted losses as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the U.S., more bank earnings are coming later today from Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley & Co., which follow positive quarterly results last week from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. Earnings from Goldman Sachs Group, Netflix, Tesla and United Airlines are expected Wednesday.\n\nThe view that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its cycle of raising interest rates helped the Wall Street gains on Monday, according to Trading Economics. That sentiment grew as last week\u2019s producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation, came in well below analyst expectations.\n\nStill, the Fed is likely to raise rates again above the current 5% to 5.25%. Christopher Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said last week at an event hosted by New York University that the central bank will need two more 25-basis-point rate increases this year to tame inflation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97.3% chance the Fed will raise by 25-basis-points, up from 96.1% on Monday.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"
