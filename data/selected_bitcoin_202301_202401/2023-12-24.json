        "title": "Can Bitcoin Price Climb To $47,000? Here\u2019s What This Crypto Analyst Thinks - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The bulls seem to be back in control following the return of the Bitcoin price to above $43,000 this past week. This positive run comes on the back of a period where the premier cryptocurrency struggled, falling below $41,000 at some point.\n\nHowever, the market leader appears to have regained most of its lost momentum, with new heights now in sight. A popular crypto pundit on the X platform has put forward a new prognosis and set a new target for the Bitcoin price.\n\nBTC Price To $47,000? Here\u2019s What Needs To Happen\n\nIn a post on X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez offered insight into the price action of Bitcoin, explaining the potential movements of the cryptocurrency over the coming weeks. This evaluation is based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) data by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nA chart showing the UTXO Realized Price Distribution of Bitcoin | Source: Ali_charts/X\n\nMartinez identified the $43,200 area as a crucial support level, which can potentially determine the fate of Bitcoin\u2019s price. The premier cryptocurrency broke above this price zone on Wednesday, December 20, and has been trading mostly sideways since.\n\nIn his post, Martinez highlighted that so long as the vital $43,200 support holds, the momentum is with the Bitcoin bulls. According to the crypto analyst, staying above this support is one catalyst that could push the Bitcoin price to above $47,360.\n\nOn the flip side of his analysis, he noted that the Bitcoin price could possibly undergo a correction. The crypto pundit emphasized that one of the bearish signals to watch out for is a sustained close below the crucial $43,200 mark.\n\nAccording to Martinez\u2019s projection, a close below $43,200 could send the price of BTC down towards $37,000. This would mean a decline of over 15% from the current price point.\n\nBitcoin Price Overview\n\nAs of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $43,783, reflecting a mere 0.5% gain in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, though, the premier cryptocurrency has shown tremendous recovery to return back to its heights of early January.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, the value of BTC is up by more than 4.5% in the past seven days. Meanwhile, the coin\u2019s price has surged by nearly 16% in December as the market leader looks to close out the year on a high.\n\nBitcoin continues to maintain its position as the largest cryptocurrency in the sector, with a market cap of roughly $858 billion.\n\nBTC price experiences correction at $44,000 on the daily timeframe | Source: BTCUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "After tumbling 65% in 2022, Bitcoin (BTC -5.98%) has been a monumental winner this year. The world's leading digital asset has skyrocketed about 160% in 2023, a gain that beats the stock market's gains by a huge margin.\n\nAs of this writing, this top cryptocurrency's price sits at about $43,700. However, I believe there's a very real possibility that it reaches the coveted $100,000 mark by the end of 2024.\n\nContinue reading to see why Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high.\n\nReady for take-off\n\nAs if Bitcoin's returns in 2023 weren't enough, there are multiple catalysts on the horizon that could propel it even higher.\n\nFor starters, there has been a lot of chatter about a potential spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to bring these products to market. Many industry observers think these will be approved as early as January.\n\nBitcoin is set to benefit. Not only would spot ETFs provide a stamp of approval for this digital asset, essentially legitimizing it in the financial services industry, but also, lots of fresh capital could be directed toward Bitcoin. Higher demand could lift the price.\n\nMacro factors could also become more accommodative. With inflation continuing to show signs of cooling, Federal Reserve officials might be ready to cut rates several times in 2024. And this looser monetary policy is generally favorable for riskier assets.\n\nOf course, it's hard to know how much of this optimism is already factored into the price of Bitcoin. But these still are potentially positive developments to pay attention to.\n\nPerhaps the most potent catalyst is next year's halving. Happening approximately every four years, this event cuts in half the new supply of Bitcoin that enters the market. This situation of reduced supply paired with rising demand has usually been extremely bullish for Bitcoin. The next halving is expected in late April.\n\nMaintain the right mindset\n\nBefore going out and loading up on Bitcoin in your portfolio, it's a good idea not to forget that this is still a very volatile asset. For some investors, its up-and-down nature might be too hard to stomach. And for those in or near retirement, owning Bitcoin might be out of the question.\n\nEven for those who are ready to invest, buying only an amount that you are willing to lose is a smart strategy. That's particularly true for people who might not be familiar with Bitcoin. Obviously, as you learn more and gain greater conviction, boosting that allocation can be the right move.\n\nAs with all things investing, don't forget to maintain a long-term time horizon. With Bitcoin, this is doubly important. You should intend to hold for the next decade to watch how things develop. In other words, don't expect to get rich quick.\n\nAnd while I do believe $100,000 is a totally realistic outcome for Bitcoin in 2024, it's not a sure thing. The necessary elements are in place for a monster return, but it's impossible to know what will happen in the next 12 months.\n\nInvestors should definitely still be optimistic about Bitcoin. But the best investors also know that everything doesn't always go according to plan."

        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nCrypto\u2019s 14th year in existence was one marred by scandal, bankruptcy, fraud and regulatory squabbling. It still may have been the industry\u2019s best year ever.\n\nThe cast of \u201cCrypto 2023\u201d starred figures that are now practically synonymous with fraud: Sam Bankman-Fried, Changpeng Zhao, Alex Mashinsky, and, less prominently, Heather \u201cRazzlekhan\u201d Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein (aka \u2018Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde\u2019).\n\nDespite all the bad press, the young industry notched some notable wins.\n\nBitcoin, the crypto\u2019s bellwether asset, is up 160% for the year. Two high-profile court cases came down in the industry\u2019s favor. And a long-awaited approval for a mainstream investment product is expected in January, potentially flooding the scene with new investors.\n\nLike the rest of the financial world, digital assets got a boost from an improving macroeconomic picture in cooling inflation, a growing economy, and a long-awaited end in sight for the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes.\n\n\u201cIt was the year of crypto\u2019s resiliency,\u201d Kyla Curley, a crypto expert and partner at global advisory StoneTurn, tells CNN.\n\nOne big component of that resiliency is how US authorities, particularly the Department of Justice, flexed their enforcement muscles on crypto, even in the absence of clear regulations.\n\n\u201cFraud is fraud,\u201d Curley says, \u201cRegardless of the technology or the industry \ufeff\u2026 you cannot stop human nature. When it comes down to it, people will find a way to exploit the rules.\u201d\n\nThe bad-apple case for optimism\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, left, was convicted on seven counts of fraud in early November. Two weeks later, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges in a settlement with US authorities. Eduardo Munoz/Costas Baltas/Reuters\n\nNo figure loomed quite as large over crypto in 2023 than Bankman-Fried, the entrepreneur once hailed as a visionary who was found guilty in November of orchestrating a yearslong, multibillion-dollar fraud through his FTX trading platform.\n\nThe trial of SBF, as he\u2019s widely known, was the spectacle of the year for crypto\u2019s biggest critics and its most strident fans.\n\nFor those inclined to cast crypto as an elaborate scam, the trial pulled back the curtain on the fly-by-night fraud underpinning FTX, which attracted millions of mainstream investors with its pitch as a beginner-friendly way to get into the emerging digital asset space. The rapid rise and fall of SBF is now Exhibit A for crypto detractors.\n\nOn the flip side, the crypto faithful who made SBF a into a billionaire pseudo-savior also cheered his conviction, casting the verdict as a an overdue purge of a bad apple.\n\nA couple of weeks after the verdict, US authorities notched another enforcement slam dunk. Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, the founder of the most popular crypto trading platform, Binance, pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges as part of a $4 billion settlement.\n\n\u201c2023 was a bad year for grifters and a good year for builders,\u201d says Faryar Shirzad, the chief policy officer for Coinbase. \u201cWe\u2019re going into 2024 with many of the worst of the grifters out of the market, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nIn the two weeks following CZ\u2019s guilty plea, bitcoin surged 23% to reach $44,000 \u2014 its highest level in 18 months, as investors looked ahead to more positive news on the horizon.\n\nBitcoin bulls dig in\n\nThe main event for crypto in 2024 could come as soon next month, when US regulators are expected to greenlight applications for the very first spot bitcoin ETF, or exchange traded fund, in the American market.\n\nPut simply, a spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to track the price of bitcoin without actually owning the digital currency. That\u2019s appealing for mainstream investors for a few reasons. First, it gives everyday investors who are wary of crypto a relatively safe way to dip their toe in the notoriously volatile market.\n\nETFs also trade on traditional stock exchanges, which means investors can access them through their tried-and-true brokerage rather than creating a new account in the crypto-verse. And, of course, the prospect of regulatory oversight adds another layer of protection and transparency.\n\nThe upshot: There could be a lot of new money flowing into bitcoin very soon.\n\nAdding to that bullish sentiment: the bitcoin halving, or, more menacingly, \u201cthe halvening.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s often a buy-the-hype-sell-the-news kind of event, the halving does tend to push bitcoin higher. Essentially, bitcoin is a finite asset, and every four years the algorithm reduces the number of new tokens that can enter circulation by half (hence the name).\n\n\u201cThe \u2018halving\u2019 is the ultimate geek event for Bitcoiners in 2024,\u201d Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, said in a statement. \u201cSo if history repeats itself \u2026 we may not see the peak in Bitcoin until sometime in 2025, with 2024 acting as an entr\u00e9e to the main event.\u201d\n\nTrenchev said the \u201ctwin-turbo boost\u201d of the spot ETF approval and the halving, expected in the spring, should propel bitcoin to $100,000 \u2014 a 45% jump over its all-time high of 69,000, reached in November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe road to $100,000 will be lined with unexpected potholes and double-digit declines as Bitcoin,\u201d said Trenchev. \u201cTo borrow a phrase from one its biggest detractors Warren Buffett, \u2018transfers money from the impatient to the patient.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor an even more bullish prediction, look to Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital and a longtime bitcoin evangelist.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ends the year at $140,000,\u201d he told the digital news outlet Semafor."

        "content": "This time last year, crypto investors wondered if the bleak winter would ever come to an end. FTX, a popular crypto platform, had just collapsed and Bitcoin (BTC) had erased most of the gains of the previous few years. Some wondered if the emerging crypto market could ever recover.\n\nToday tells a different story. The granddaddy of crypto has soared over 160% since the start of the year. According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin opened at around $16,540 on Jan. 1, and at time of writing it was worth almost $44,000.\n\nIs the crypto winter over?\n\nThere's a sense of cautious optimism about Bitcoin and crypto right now. It has crept upwards in spite of economic uncertainty and heavy regulatory headwinds. Bitcoin's price hasn't reached the highs we saw in November 2021, but it has demonstrated a certain resilience. The crypto fear and greed index, which measures market sentiment, has been in greed territory for over a month now.\n\nOne of the big driving factors behind Bitcoin's recent rally is the hope that the SEC might approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2024. Up to now, the SEC has steadfastly refused to greenlight spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, many observers think next year will bring a change of heart.\n\nEarlier this year, an appeals court ruled that the SEC didn't have grounds to say no to the EFT proposals. The SEC didn't appeal the judgment, which fueled speculation that it may now give the go-ahead to one (or several) of the applications in the pipeline.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF could significantly change the crypto landscape. Investors would no longer need to buy Bitcoin from a crypto exchange. Instead, they could use their brokerage account to buy shares in an ETF that owns Bitcoin. It would make it much easier for both retail and institutional inventors to hold the leading crypto.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others.

Get started\n\nIs it safe to buy Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nDuring the crypto frenzy of 2020 and 2021, many Americans bought crypto for the first time. The soaring prices created a sense that the market could only go upward. Speculation was rife. Sadly, many retail investors lost money in the subsequent crash, which saw Bitcoin lose around half its value in six months.\n\nIf you're wondering whether it will be safe to buy Bitcoin in 2024, the short answer is that cryptocurrency is a risky asset class. It is still a relatively new and unregulated industry, and there is a lot we don't know about how it will unfold. Here are some questions to consider:\n\nAre you comfortable with the volatility? Bitcoin's price fluctuates dramatically. It gained over 300% in 2020, gained another 60% in 2021, only to lose 65% in 2022. It isn't uncommon for Bitcoin's price to move by 20% in a matter of days, which can be difficult for some investors to stomach.\n\nBitcoin's price fluctuates dramatically.

Cryptocurrency exchanges don't carry the same protections as a bank or brokerage account.\n\nIf you don't want to move your Bitcoin to a crypto wallet, make sure you know what might happen to your funds if the exchange you use fails. Cryptocurrency exchanges don't carry the same protections as a bank or brokerage account. How does crypto fit with the rest of your portfolio? There are many different investments to choose from, so try to make sure crypto only makes up a small percentage of your portfolio. That way you'll benefit if Bitcoin goes to the moon, but your wealth-building plans won't be destroyed if it doesn't succeed.\n\nThere are many different investments to choose from, so try to make sure crypto only makes up a small percentage of your portfolio. That way you'll benefit if Bitcoin goes to the moon, but your wealth-building plans won't be destroyed if it doesn't succeed. How do you think Bitcoin will perform long term? Short-term speculation rarely pays off, so try to understand Bitcoin's long-term potential use cases. Some people argue that Bitcoin could become the native currency of the internet. Others think it could take a portion of the global remittance market or become a currency for emerging markets. Critics believe it has no inherent value at all.\n\nShort-term speculation rarely pays off, so try to understand Bitcoin's long-term potential use cases. Some people argue that Bitcoin could become the native currency of the internet. Others think it could take a portion of the global remittance market or become a currency for emerging markets. Critics believe it has no inherent value at all. Are you comfortable with crypto's regulatory situation? Most cryptocurrencies are currently viewed as commodities and come under the purview of the CFTC. The SEC has brought charges against several top crypto exchanges this year, making the case that many cryptos are actually unregistered securities. At the same time, at some point the government is likely to introduce a regulatory framework for crypto. But right now there's a lot of noise and not a lot of certainty, which some investors find concerning.\n\nSpeaking personally, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to make up a small percentage of my wider investments. However, I am concerned by the regulatory landscape and the questions about what goes on (or has gone on) behind the scenes at various crypto platforms. Bitcoin's price may have recovered from the collapse of FTX, but for me, the stain of the fraud and extreme mismanagement remains.\n\nKey takeaway\n\nBitcoin's 150% rally in 2023 is great news for crypto investors. But don't assume that the end of the crypto winter means it is safe to enter the crypto waters. Bitcoin still has many significant hurdles to cross. These include a changing regulatory landscape, bruised investor confidence, and questions about its utility. Do your research before you jump in."
