        "content": "Bitcoin Dominance Surges to 54% as Halving Approaches\n\nBitcoin's market dominance has reached a 30-month high of 54%, indicating the top cryptocurrency's growing strength leading up to the halving event in April 2024.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving occurs every four years, reducing the mining reward per block and lowering the influx of new Bitcoin into the market. With the next halving, the reward will be cut from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\nAs Bitcoin's supply growth slows while demand rises, its dominance increases. Bitcoin maintained over 80% dominance in the 2017 bull market, but it fell to the 50-60% range in the 2021 bull run.\n\nNow, ETF excitement and the halving event have brought its dominance back up to 54%, the highest level since April 2021. The rise coincided with Bitcoin rallying above $30,000 amid news of a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US.\n\nNoelle Acheson, a market analyst, says Bitcoin's safe-haven appeal and ETF momentum have helped boost its dominance over altcoins like ether. She notes Bitcoin tends to lead in early market cycles before investors get more comfortable with higher-risk assets.\n\nWith Bitcoin beating most altcoins in recent performance, its bullish momentum could signal an eventual altcoin rally once money begins flowing from Bitcoin into other crypto assets. For now, its dominance reflects its strength as the crypto market awaits the next major catalyst."

        "title": "Should You Buy Coinbase Stock on Higher Bitcoin Prices? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Valued at $18.45 billion by market cap, Coinbase Global (COIN) is among the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Coinbase went public in 2021, and currently trades 79% below all-time highs.\n\nHowever, COIN has staged a remarkable comeback year-to-date, rising 114% in the first 10 months of 2023 - with recent gains fueled by fresh regulatory optimism for cryptocurrencies.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nMeanwhile, with none other than fund manager Cathie Wood taking advantage of the recent rally to unload her shares, let\u2019s see whether Coinbase stock is worth buying on the latest headlines.\n\nCoinbase Stock Lags Bitcoin's Price Surge\n\nThe performance of Coinbase is closely tied to key cryptocurrency asset prices, such as Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), which account for a majority of the exchange's trading volumes. Generally, trading volumes are higher in a bull market, allowing Coinbase to benefit from higher fees and commissions. Alternatively, volumes drop when sentiment turns bearish, resulting in lower revenue.\n\nFor instance, Coinbase increased sales from $533.7 million in 2019 to $7.83 billion in 2021 as cryptocurrency prices exploded higher. But in the last 12 months, its sales have fallen to $2.7 billion, with Bitcoin currently trading about 50% below all-time highs.\n\nA key driver for the recent rally to 18-month highs in Bitcoin is investor optimism over the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The long-awaited approval of Grayscale's fund could clear the way for more listings from large asset management companies, including BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) - which potentially opens the floodgates for billions more investor dollars to pour into the sector.\n\nHowever, investors should note that COIN is hardly a perfect proxy for Bitcoin prices, despite its dependence on the volatile market. Over the last three months, COIN is down 24%, while BTC is up 15%. And in the last month alone, COIN's 7% gain significantly lags a nearly 30% rise in BTC.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nCoinbase Stock: Looking Beyond Bitcoin\n\nTo its credit, Coinbase has expanded its portfolio of products and solutions over the past two years, enabling it to expand its ecosystem significantly and reduce its dependency on volatile crypto trading volumes. For instance, in 2021, the company\u2019s transaction revenue accounted for 87% of sales. In Q2 of 2023, transaction sales accounted for less than 50% of total revenue.\n\nIn particular, Coinbase is banking on its subscription and services business to gain traction. This segment includes products such as interest income, custodial fees, staking, and blockchain rewards. Revenue in its subscription and services business grew from just $45 million in 2020 to $792 million in 2023. In Q2, subscription sales more than doubled to $335.4 million.\n\nBut for Coinbase to remain a solid long-term investment option, Bitcoin will have to gain widespread adoption globally. Bitcoin was built to replace fiat currencies and facilitate global transactions at a low cost. However, the lack of regulatory clarity has remained a significant headwind - which is why crypto-related investments reacted so strongly to recent indications of a potential SEC victory.\n\nAnalysts Call COIN a Hold\n\nCoinbase enjoys a first-mover advantage and is forecast to end 2023 with sales of $2.78 billion, while adjusted earnings are forecast at $1.73 per share. That said, COIN trades at 6.7x forward sales, which is quite steep for an unprofitable company that's projected to report steeper losses into the next fiscal year.\n\nOut of the 22 analysts covering Coinbase stock, the average recommendation is a \u201chold.\u201d Six recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d one recommends \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d eight recommend \u201chold,\u201d two recommend \u201cmoderate sell,\u201d and five recommend \u201cstrong sell.\u201d The average target price for COIN is $83.84, which is 12.5% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) rally, which had stalled two months back after making a solid turnaround earlier this year, once again rebounded on Oct 24. The cryptocurrency jumped nearly 6% to $34,872 to hit its highest level in almost one-and-a-half years on growing speculation that Blackrock\u2019s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will soon be a reality.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rally followed a 10% surge in Bitcoin on Oct 23, when it crossed the $35,000 mark. The enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin sent other related stocks and major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) on a rally. Ethereum prices jumped 4.5% on Oct 23 to $1,786.30, hitting its highest level since August.\n\nInvestors Optimist about Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to boost demand as it would enable more conservative investors to own Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies via traditional stock markets.\n\nThe approval is also likely to attract new investments into the crypto sector, which could further boost demand.\n\nCryptocurrencies made a solid rebound in 2023 after suffering majorly last year as the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive monetary tightening campaign to curb multi-decade high inflation, which saw the central bank hiking interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022.\n\nMoreover, a couple of unfortunate events, the Terra Luna crash and a major fraud leading to the bankruptcy of FTX, saw a slump in the crypto market.\n\nCryptocurrencies staged a solid rebound this year, with Bitcoin hitting $31,000 in early July before the rally came to a halt. Bitcoin price has since been rangebound and hovering around the $25,000 mark as investors struggled to gauge the Fed\u2019s next move with its interest rate hike policy.\n\nHowever, renewed optimism among investors sent Bitcoin prices up last week after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided not to appeal its loss against Grayscale Investments in the D.C. Circuit court.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeculation is now rife that the modification made to the Registration Statement for the Ishares Bitcoin Trust, submitted to the SEC on Oct 18, suggests that Blackrock might buy Bitcoin this month to provide initial capital for its upcoming spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis definitely bodes well for the crypto market.\n\nOur Choices\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market.

        "title": "Bitcoin mining stocks are poised for a fall if the cryptocurrency hits this key level - CNBC",
        "content": "Now that bitcoin has pushed above its key resistance level of the year, the pressure is on for mining stocks, some of which could be in trouble if the cryptocurrency doesn't reach $50,000 by the second quarter of 2024. Earlier this week bitcoin climbed as high as $35,000 at one point, after being stuck under $30,000 for several months. But the Bitcoin halving is expected in the spring and it will likely reduce companies' revenue. That means the cryptocurrency may need to rally another 60% by then to lessen the suffering of some high-cost miners. \"Bitcoin prices holding steady at ($28,000-$32,000) is not tenable for a number of crypto companies, and especially not for high-cost miners,\" Needham's John Todaro said in a note this week. \"We anticipate material stock upside for Coinbase and low-cost miners if bitcoin prices surpass $45,000-$50,000 by the anticipated halving date of April 15, 2024, and material weakness if prices cannot sustain $45,000+ post-halving, in particular for high-cost miners.\" \"Post halving, lower-cost miners will take market share while higher cost producers will need to cut hash power contributed to the network until bitcoin prices rise,\" he added. Bitcoin's price is currently sitting just below $34,000, and chart analysts expect higher lows as well as higher highs over the next few months, with some anticipating it reaches $40,000 by the end of 2023. The Bitcoin halving event is highly anticipated event by crypto investors because it historically has set the stage for new bull runs. It takes place every four years when the reward for mining bitcoin \u2013 which makes up a significant portion of mining companies' revenue \u2013 is cut in half. That reduction is mandated by the Bitcoin code to reduce the supply of the cryptocurrency over time. \"The bitcoin mining industry is at a crucible moment as management teams (and investors) weigh the prospects of a bitcoin ETF, which may catalyze a rally, against record hashrate increases and the looming block reward halving that threaten industry revenues and profitability,\" JPMorgan analyst Reginald Smith said in an Oct. 11 note. \"With that as a back drop, we think discipline and timing are paramount and favor operators that offer the best relative value in light of their existing hashrate, operational efficiency, power contracts, funded growth plans and liquidity.\" Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms are the largest mining stocks by market cap. Marathon famously has the highest energy costs and lowest margins, while Riot has relatively low power costs but shares are expensive. CLSK YTD mountain Cleanspark shares year to date CleanSpark is the only mining stock in JPMorgan's coverage universe with an overweight rating, though its price target implies a 12% decline from current levels. Needham highlighted Riot and Cipher as its favorites, noting that their diversified revenue exposure could make impact from the halving more muted. Lower revenue, higher costs Generally, the mining stocks benefit from bitcoin price increases because those translate into higher mining revenue for the company. Riot shares have risen more than 10% over the past week, while CleanSpark climbed 12%, Marathon added 17% and Cipher jumped 40%. But their performance is more complex than that. In addition to their revenue from block rewards about to be cut in half, miners are also facing a steady rise in the network hash rate \u2013 which measures how much computing power the Bitcoin network uses to process transactions and is a key indicator of the network's health. The Bitcoin hash rate has been hitting new all-time highs consistently throughout the year, which is good for the health and security of Bitcoin but tends to hurt miners' revenue. \"There's been more miners that have come to the market with hardware and more people are competing for these coins today than ever before, and that makes the economics for the entire industry challenging,\" Smith said. When it comes to costs, the main one for miners is electricity. Some have a contract with a power producer where they buy a certain amount of power annually at a fixed price. Miners who buy power at spot prices stand to lose from any spike in power prices, often in the summer or winter. Another big cost: hardware. Some miners use older, less efficient mining equipment and may not be able to invest in newer equipment as they juggle other costs and variables. That could be challenging for companies as the halving approaches, but a big enough rally could help. \"If bitcoin goes up or doubles between now and the halving, these machines that I think will be uneconomical at the having could still be economical, and so it really depends on what happens with the price of bitcoin,\" Smith said. \"Roughly 20% of the network is powered by machines that just won't be economical to the next halving so those machines will have to come offline. Depending on who runs them and whether or not that entity has faster machines somewhere else, they may get forced out of the out of the market.\" \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."
