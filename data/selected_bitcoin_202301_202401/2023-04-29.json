        "title": "Bitcoin [BTC]: Interest in Ordinals rises, but is FUD on the way? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Interest in Bitcoin Ordinals continued to rise.\n\nFUD and Speculation around the U.S. government and Mt.GOX wallets impacted trader behavior.\n\nUpon their initial introduction, Bitcoin [BTC] inscriptions garnered considerable attention from the cryptocurrency community. This led to speculations that the hype would be short-lived and interest in ordinals would wane soon.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nOut of the Ordin(al)ry\n\nHowever, at press time, it appeared that inscriptions surpassed one million. This represented roughly 6% of the total activity on the Bitcoin network.\n\nConsequently, the fees associated with ordinals that are paid out to miners rose. This resulted in a decrease in the selling pressure on ordinals.\n\nDue to these factors, Bitcoin miners started seeing growth in terms of revenue generated over the last few days, according to blockchain.com\n\nSpeculations start to rise\n\nHowever, the FUD around Bitcoin could soon stunt this growth. Recently, there was speculation going around that large transactions were being made by the BTC wallets of the U.S. government and Mt.Gox trustees.\n\nFor context, Mt. Gox was once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world before it filed for bankruptcy in 2014. The exchange suffered a massive security breach resulting in the loss of 850,000 bitcoin, worth around $460 million at the time.\n\nThe court appointed Nobuaki Kobayashi as the trustee to oversee the fair and transparent distribution of the remaining assets and funds to the exchange\u2019s creditors.\n\nAdditionally, Kobayashi sold a significant amount of the remaining bitcoin over the years to pay back the creditors. He currently holds a substantial number of bitcoins which will be distributed to the claimants.\n\nMany stated that the FUD surrounding the government transactions has led to the recent decline in BTC prices.\n\nIt is to be noted that the U.S government was the largest holder of Bitcoin at press time. According to Glassnode\u2019s data, the U.S. government and the Mt.Gox trustee held 205,514 and 137,890 BTC, respectively.\n\nBased on our labels at @glassnode, neither the USG, nor Mt Gox are spending any coins from addresses we monitor. Stay safe out there folks. https://t.co/1B8gUVKjon pic.twitter.com/O5CZ0VtrYh \u2014 _Check\u0271ate ?\u26a1?\u2622\ufe0f?\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) April 26, 2023\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today\n\nThis FUD also affected trader behavior as well. As the expiry date for 105,000 Bitcoin options draws near, GreeksLive\u2019s data showed that these options have a Put Call Ratio of 0.85.\n\nFurthermore, this ratio suggested that there are more investors betting on a dip in Bitcoin\u2019s price. The options also have a max pain point of $27,000, which is the price level where option holders would face the most significant financial loss. The estimated total value of these options was $3.1 billion."

        "title": "If U.S. defaults on debt Bitcoin could rise nearly 70%, says Standard Chartered analyst - Fortune",
        "content": "Bitcoin bulls have had a good year so far. If the U.S. defaults on its debt, it could get even better, at least in terms of their Bitcoin investment.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s head of digital assets research. He told Insider this week that a U.S. default\u2014which he called a \u201clow-probability, high-impact event\u201d\u2014could cause Bitcoin to jump by about $20,000, an increase of nearly 70% from current levels.\n\nBitcoin started the year at well below $17,000 but is now hovering near $30,000. That\u2019s still well off its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, and some investors who bought Bitcoin around then are no doubt still licking their wounds.\n\nBitcoin, Kendrick predicted, would fare well even if overall cryptocurrencies, which trade more like stocks, did not. \u201cSo actually, the optimal trade would probably be long Bitcoin, short Ethereum. That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this,\u201d Kendrick told Insider.\n\nOn Monday, Kendrick said in a note that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024 and the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d was over. He added that Bitcoin has benefited from its status as a \u201cbranded safe haven, a perceived relative store of value and a means of remittance.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price shot up earlier this year after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed and fears of a banking crisis mounted.\n\nMeanwhile the debt ceiling crisis has intensified. On Wednesday, House Republicans passed legislation (barely) that would raise the government\u2019s debt ceiling in exchange for spending restrictions. In the weeks ahead, they\u2019ll try to reach a compromise with President Joe Biden that would allow the nation\u2019s debt to be lifted.\n\nIf the U.S. did default on its debt this summer, the consequences would be severe for America and the world. Last month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned lawmakers that \u201ca default on our debt would trigger an economic and financial catastrophe.\u201d\n\nFew think it will come to that.\n\nBut even without a U.S. default, many Bitcoin bulls see good things ahead. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said in February that in five years Bitcoin will hit \u201croughly $670,000, something like that, and then by 2030, as we see more use cases and more of these insurance policies taken out against fiscal and policy regimes that are not healthy, we think it could pass $1 million.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has plenty of critics and doubters, of course. Mark Mobius, the billionaire cofounder of Mobius Capital Partners, predicted in December that Bitcoin would fall to $10,000 at some point this year. He has said of Bitcoin, \u201cIt\u2019s not an investment, it\u2019s a religion.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett reiterated his long-running skepticism. \u201cSomething like Bitcoin, it is a gambling token, and it doesn\u2019t have any intrinsic value,\u201d he told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t stop people from wanting to play the roulette wheel.\u201d"

That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this,\" Kendrick said.\n\nIf Congress fails to lift the $31.4 trillion federal debt limit, a default could come sometime in the summer \u2014 an event that could cause seismic ruptures global markets. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned a default would be catastrophic for the US economy, sparking mass unemployment, payment failures, and higher rates \"into perpetuity.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith House Republicans and the White House still far from a deal to raise the debt ceiling, yields on three-month Treasurys recently jumped to a 22-year high, as they would mature around a potential default date.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin is still recovering from a massive sell-off that began in late 2021 and continued through much of 2022 as the Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive tightening cycle.\n\nBut bitcoin has rallied nearly 80% so far in 2023 and recently neared $30,000 as First Republic Bank's woes reignited fears over the financial sector.\n\nFor his part, Kendrick is already bullish on bitcoin, saying in a note on Monday that it could surge to $100,000 by the end of 2024 due to bank turmoil, bitcoin halving, and the expected end of Fed rate hikes, among other things, though it didn't mention the risk of a US default.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer,\" he wrote."

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nMost of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have appreciated in value over the last seven days, with Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and the Internet Computer Project (ICP) leading the rally.\n\nBitcoin is around 7.5% pricier than it was this time last weekend and trades for $29,295 as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, the world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency slipped down to $27,500, but on Wednesday, it reclaimed $29,000 after another potential insolvency rocked the traditional finance world; shares in First Republic Bank fell 50% on Tuesday, a day after its latest quarterly report revealed a marked decline in deposits.\n\nFrom Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper onwards, crypto has been pitched to the world as an alternative to the banking system. So, when TradFi institutions are in trouble, investors often flock to crypto\u2014as happened last month when news of Credit Suisse\u2019s insolvency pumped Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin\n\nThe market\u2019s second biggest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, only managed to add 2.7% to its value this week and currently trades for $1,906.\n\nThe biggest rallies among leading cryptocurrencies came from Solana, which grew 11% and is now worth $23.35, and ICP blew up 16.6% to change hands at $6.58.\n\nHolders of Cosmos Hub (ATOM) found their stashes increased this Saturday as the token rallied 8.5% over the week to trade at $11.68.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe glare from regulators\u2019 headlamps has been intensifying recently as U.S. agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) continue to bring enforcement actions against the industry instead of new guidelines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, Democrat and California lower house lawmaker Matt Haney introduced Assembly Bill 1229, a legal framework for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that would change state legislation to enable DAOs to incorporate and pay taxes in California while providing better safeguards for Californians participating in the Web3 economy.\n\nThe bill already has support from crypto investment firm Andreessen Horowitz and the Crypto Council for Innovation.\n\nOn Tuesday, news broke on Twitter that Binance US had walked away from a deal to acquire the assets of crypto lender Voyager, one of the high-profile casualties stemming from Terra\u2019s collapse last May. In a statement to Decrypt, the exchange cited \u201cthe hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States\u201d as the main factor behind the decision to ax the deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, reports emerged that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had hired lawyers to defend himself against multiple legal threats filed against him and his exchange by the SEC, the CFTC, and the Department of Justice.\n\nThat day, crypto-friendly Texas Senator Ted Cruz launched a diatribe against the idea of an American central bank digital currency (CBDC) during the Bitcoin Policy Summit.\n\nCBDCs are currently being researched by governments worldwide, including those of the U.S. and the EU. A CBDC is a stablecoin pegged to the local currency, and advocates say they would facilitate online payments while taking advantage of blockchain features like instant settlement and smart contracts. However, critics fear the result would lead to an increase in centralized control over our money, which goes against crypto's very ethos.\n\nCruz argued that U.S. leaders would use a CBDC \u201cto destroy all value of Bitcoin, to destroy anonymity, to destroy decentralization.\u201d He added: \u201cThe same people that want to see a CBDC, they hate Bitcoin, and they hate cash. Let's be clear; they don't like cash for exactly the reason I like cash because it is not subjected to centralized control that is not subject to constant surveillance. And so I hope we see growing resistance to a CBDC.\u201d\n\nCBDC skepticism is prevalent in Republican circles. Last month Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Ohio Representative Warren Davidson echoed Cruz\u2019s sentiments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, at a Bloomberg event on Thursday, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) CEO Julia Leung announced the special administrative region will launch its crypto licensing regime next month.\n\nThe new rules promise to let retail investors trade significant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with fewer restrictions from June 1."

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nCircle launches cross-chain USDC transfer protocol\n\nCircle launched a cross-chain protocol that enables USDC transfers between the Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains. The protocol works by burning the selected amount of native USDC on the source chain, and minting an equivalent amount of new USDC on the intended destination chain. The protocol essentially makes USDC transfers between the two networks faster and more user-friendly, as prior to its launch, people had to use third-party bridges or a Circle partner to facilitate transfers between the two networks. Additional support for Solana and other blockchains will be added later in 2023.\n\nStablecoin payments: Visa shares plans for \u2018ambitious\u2019 crypto product\n\nCuy Sheffield, the head of crypto at Visa, announced a new cryptocurrency-related project, on April 24, focused on stablecoin payments. Details are sparse at this stage; however, Sheffiled shared a job listing relating to the project, with the description noting that the \u201cVisa Crypto Team is building the next generation of products to facilitate commerce in everyone\u2019s digital and mobile lives.\u201d The job listing is seeking candidates with a good understanding of layer-1 and layer-2 solutions, alongside experience with writing smart contracts using the programming language Solidity, among other things.\n\nKraken asks San Francisco court to intervene against IRS demands\n\nCrypto exchange Kraken has fought back against the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over what it feels is an \u201cunjustified treasure hunt\u201d for user\u2019s trading info. According to court documents, the firm requested a federal court in San Francisco to intervene and ask the IRS to back off. The IRS issued a summons in February demanding additional information on Kraken users who traded $20,000 or more in any single year from 2016 to 2020.\n\nMeta disclosed in its Q1 earnings report that its metaverse unit, Reality Labs, posted a loss of around $4 billion during the quarter. In what has been a costly venture for the firm, the $4 billion loss adds to the $14 billion Reality Labs loss over the entirety of 2022. Still, Meta posted a profit totalling roughly $5.7 billion in Q1 overall, with the firm\u2019s work on artificial intelligence somewhat curbing the losses. Mark Zuckerberg was also not phased by the loss from Reality Labs, as he reiterated that \u201cwe continue to expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023\u201d as the firm eyes growth in the long term.\n\nViral clips of Securities and Exchange Commision chair Gary Gensler started circulating this week, showing him take a highly contradictory stance on crypto compared to what he holds now. As it stands, Gensler thinks almost every crypto asset apart from BTC is a security, and has pushed hard to regulate the crypto sector from that viewpoint. However, in a snippet from one of his \u201cBlockchain and Money\u201d lectures from 2018 \u2014 while he was working as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 Gensler said, \u201cThree quarters of the market is non-securities, it\u2019s just a commodity, cash, crypto.\u201d He even suggested Ether was not a security, despite repeatedly suggesting otherwise over the past couple years.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $29,275, Ether (ETH) at $1,900 and XRP at $0.47. The total market cap is at $1.2 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAmong the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Render Token (RNDR) at 40.91%, Cronos (CRO) at 13.47% and Injective (INJ) at 10.49%.\n\nThe top three altcoin losers of the week are PancakeSwap (CAKE) at 19.13%, Zilliqa (ZIL) at 12.41% and Optimism (OP) at 11.26%.\n\n\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph\u2019s market analysis.\n\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a critical moment here in the U.S. and, as I like to say, it\u2019s really a moment for Congress to step up.\u201d\n\nJeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that you\u2019re seeing all these concerns about de-dollarization at the same time they\u2019re cracking down on crypto.\u201d\n\nDavid Sacks, co-host of the All-In podcast\n\n\u201c[Blockchain] is about helping different groups of people come together to be able to trust each other more, to collaborate across larger distances on many different kinds of projects.\u201d\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder\n\n\u201cThe fights about mining aren\u2019t really about mining.

Analysts such as the chief operating officer of investment firm Onramp, Jesse Meyers, believe that raising the debt ceiling will likely prompt the Federal Reserve to print more money, thus boosting capital inflows into \u201crisky\u201d assets like BTC.\n\n\u201cWhen the debt ceiling is lifted and credit-contraction leads to economic crisis\u2026 They will have to print money on a massive scale,\u201d he noted. \u201c#Bitcoin was the winner during the last round of stimulus.\u201d\n\nFUD of the Week\n\nOrdinals Finance has conducted a $1M rug pull: CertiK\n\nEthereum-based decentralized finance protocol Ordinals Finance, was accused of performing a rug pull. The protocol enables users to lend and borrow inscriptions. However, blockchain security firm CertiK reported that the protocol\u2019s developer abruptly pulled 256 million OFI tokens out of its smart contracts using a \u201csafuToken\u201d function. According to CertiK, another 13 million OFI was then removed through an \u201cownerRewithdraw\u201d function, bringing the total number of withdrawn tokens to 269 million. In total, the reported loss to investors was estimated to be around $1 million, almost half of the total OFI market cap.\n\nOne crypto wallet launched 114 dodgy memecoins in two months\n\nAccording to research from pseudonymous blockchain sleuth ZachXBT posted, on April 26, one specific wallet address launched \u201c114 memecoin scams\u201d over the previous 45 days. ZachXBT tracked the 0x739c58807B99Cb274f6FD96B10194202b8EEfB47 address, and found that stolen funds from scams are continually sent to this address. ZachXBT was unable to calculate how much the funds equated to, as the alleged scammer used multiple wallets to split up funds. \u201cI suspect there are more too. These are just ones sent to that deposit address lol,\u201d ZachXBT wrote.\n\nGoogle Ads data: $4M stolen through crypto phishing URLs\n\nAccording to Google Ads data coupled with blockchain analytics, over $4 million has been stolen from people that clicked on malicious phishing websites that mimic legitimate crypto platforms.
