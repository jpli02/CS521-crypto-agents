        "content": "Online payments giant Block reported on Thursday strong growth in revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter, as the main stalwarts of its business, digital wallet CashApp and business payments platform Square, showed large gains.\n\nThe company posted $1.66 billion in gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2022, an almost 40% increase from nearly $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue was $4.65 billion, a jump from $4.1 billion in the same quarter of 2021. CashApp and Square drove most of those gains, as CashApp posted a staggering 64% jump in year-over-year gross profit, and Square had 22%.\n\nIn after-hours trading, share prices rose approximately 8% percent from $74 to $80.\n\nThe company reported quarterly earnings per share of 22 cents, compared with an estimate of 30 cents per share by analysts polled by FactSet. Block, however, beat predictions on revenue and gross profit.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead to 2023 and beyond, we are focused on balancing growth and efficiency and will prioritize speed, agility, and accountability,\u201d Block CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Amrita Ahuja wrote in a letter to shareholders.\n\nThe outlook, however, for the company\u2019s dive into Bitcoin was more tepid. Block invested $220 million in Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021, but the company\u2019s Bitcoin holdings were valued at just $133 million at the end of 2022.\n\nIts Bitcoin trading business on CashApp also declined. Total fourth-quarter revenue from Bitcoin sales on CashApp was $1.83 billion, down from $1.96 billion in the same quarter in 2021, and its year-over-year gross profits from the cryptocurrency decreased from approximately $46 million to $35 million, a mere fraction of Block\u2019s total gross profit.\n\nIn 2018, Dorsey, a notable Bitcoin evangelist, announced that CashApp users would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin through the digital wallet. And more than two years later, the company, formerly known as Square, made significant investments in the cryptocurrency. To signify his company\u2019s devotion to crypto, Dorsey then announced that the payments titan would be changing its name to Block. Since then, he has continued to double down on Bitcoin.\n\nDorsey announced the creation of TBD, a Block subsidiary that soon released a white paper detailing plans for the construction of a decentralized Bitcoin trading exchange. After the fall of FTX, Block also announced that it\u2019s developing a new wallet to allow its customers to hold Bitcoin themselves, rather than having tokens handled by third parties. And the company has even recently invested in a Bitcoin mining firm that says it is trying to bring cheap energy to places like Kenya and Malawi."

        "title": "Gary Gensler on Meeting With SBF and His Crypto Crackdown - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Photo: Shuran Huang/The New York Times\n\nAs recently as a year ago, Sam Bankman-Fried seemed to be an unstoppable force in official Washington. The conspicuously disheveled founder and CEO of FTX had positioned himself as a new sort of billionaire and crypto entrepreneur \u2014 someone who promised to do good with his extraordinary wealth, who had publicly discussed supporting Democratic political candidates to the tune of a billion dollars in upcoming elections, and who seemed to offer the possibility of legitimizing an industry that had grown exponentially during the pandemic while operating on the fringes of America\u2019s financial regulatory apparatus.\n\nBy last March, things appeared to be going exceptionally well for Bankman-Fried as he prepared for a private meeting with Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We now know that Bankman-Fried was in the midst of executing a dual-pronged political and media strategy that looks to have been one of the most ambitious political-influence operations in recent memory. He was testifying before Congress about how to regulate crypto markets, and behind closed doors, he was successfully lobbying for a bill that would have enacted a system that was very beneficial to him. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried was schmoozing with (and offering money to) a group of self-styled policy professionals and political pundits whose unofficial seal of approval conferred an aura of intellectual seriousness on his project.\n\nAt the time of his meeting with Gensler, Bankman-Fried was in the process of acquiring a stake in the stock exchange IEX, and he was joined by a group of FTX and IEX representatives to pitch a new SEC-approved crypto-trading platform. They included a top FTX lawyer who had worked with Gensler and who, in private, had reportedly bragged about his access to \u201cGary.\u201d This meeting was coming on the heels of a dinner Bankman-Fried arranged with the SEC\u2019s incoming general counsel, Dan Berkovitz. (Berkowitz recently stepped down.)\n\nBut things did not go as planned for the FTX and IEX crew at that meeting last March. They were evidently seeking agency approval for a so-called \u201calternative trading system,\u201d a more lightly regulated alternative to national securities exchanges. Gensler, in his telling, sharply rebuffed the group.\n\n\u201cI indicated to them they could take their slide deck down on the second slide,\u201d Gensler told me during a recent and wide-ranging conversation, \u201cand that I didn\u2019t think that they should \u2014 with all respect \u2014 that it was not a valuable use of their time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Gensler, FTX was far too conflicted to satisfy the agency\u2019s regulations. He said that he told the group \u201cthat alternative trading systems were something amongst and for institutional investors\u201d and that \u201cjust coming into compliance was going to need them to disaggregate their business to address the conflicts \u2014 that they should have a separate exchange, separate broker-dealer, separate custody, and that they were in the national security exchange Zip Code, not in the ATS Zip Code.\u201d (The outcome of the meeting was first reported by the New York Times.)\n\nIt was not the first time that Gensler met with Bankman-Fried and other FTX representatives \u2014 there was also a previously disclosed session in late 2021 \u2014 but when we spoke, it was unclear whether there had been any other meetings between the two men, which might raise further questions among the public about Bankman-Fried\u2019s access to U.S. regulators. Gensler\u2019s calendars for 2022 have not yet been fully released, so questions on this front have persisted.\n\nSo were there any other meetings between the two? \u201cNo,\u201d Gensler quickly responded when I put the question to him directly.\n\nGensler\u2019s brushback last March may have helped to limit the extraordinary fallout in the sector last year, though of course, plenty of people have been caught without their coats in the harsh and unsparing deep freeze of crypto winter. Retail investors have lost extraordinary sums, there has been a wave of large crypto bankruptcies, and evidence of rampant fraud in the industry, which was already abundant, continues to accumulate.\n\nIt is also eminently reasonable to ask whether the SEC could \u2014 and should \u2014 have done more to crack down on the industry before now. It is, after all, comparatively easy to aggressively go after companies or their principals after their businesses have been exposed by the press or competitors as financially unsound or perhaps even fundamentally fraudulent enterprises, and given the publicly available information, it is fair to question whether the SEC should have pursued concerns about the industry more quickly and assertively than it did in recent years.\n\nThe political fallout from the implosion of FTX and the criminal indictment of Bankman-Fried is far from over. It has embarrassed prominent figures throughout Washington. Whether it will have any implications for Gensler, by all accounts an ambitious player in the Biden administration, is still an open question.\n\nIt all occurred at a precarious time for him. He was already under fire for an ambitious regulatory agenda that had drawn the ire of Wall Street and generated internal frustration among SEC staff, and some of the same members of Congress who criticized Gensler last year for investigating the industry too aggressively, including New York congressman Ritchie Torres and Minnesota representative Tom Emmer, have since sought to blame Gensler for the FTX disaster.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been reports since last summer suggesting the possibility of a change of leadership at the Treasury Department, where Secretary Janet Yellen has had to deal with widespread public anxiety over inflation. Gensler began his career in government service at Treasury in the late 1990s after nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, and there have been slight rumblings, which have made their way into the financial press, that Gensler might be interested in leading the department if Yellen decides to leave at some point in the coming years, particularly if Biden is reelected.\n\nAll of this raises the stakes for the 65-year-old, as he mounts a public defense of the SEC\u2019s record on crypto regulation and enforcement, including during our discussion. We talked about how the industry tried to outmaneuver Congress and the country\u2019s financial regulators, as well as how crypto markets should be regulated, but Gensler also made clear that he has been grappling with the same question as many of the rest of us: What, exactly, is the point of crypto?\n\nFrom the vantage point of today, it is clear that Bankman-Fried was very close to building what has been fairly described as a \u201cregulatory moat\u201d around FTX \u2014 locking in a role for himself and his company at the top of the crypto industry. The legislation that he backed, called the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, would have given the Commodity Futures Trading Commission authority to regulate certain crypto products \u2014 specifically, bitcoin, ether, and other vaguely identified \u201cdigital commodities\u201d \u2014 and displaced the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction in the area. It was an ambitious but straightforward strategy of domestic regulatory arbitrage that would have effectively allowed the company to pick its own regulator in the U.S. (Though, of course, the March meeting with Gensler shows that Bankman-Fried was looking for regulatory buy-in from all relevant agencies.)\n\nFairly or not, the CFTC is generally regarded as a more pliant and less assertive financial regulator than the SEC. It was therefore not that surprising when the head of the CFTC disclosed that Bankman-Fried had met with him and other senior officials at the agency ten times over roughly the year leading up to the collapse of the FTX, despite concerns raised in real time by commodities specialists.\n\n\u201cI love the CFTC,\u201d said Gensler, who ran the agency during the Obama administration, as we touched on these uncomfortable facts, implicating some of his former and current colleagues. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me to say anything negative about\u201d the CFTC, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just too \u2014 it\u2019s in my blood.\u201d\n\nStill, he was unsparing in his assessment of the merits of the legislative effort, which was spearheaded in the Senate by Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow. The bill, Gensler told me, would have \u201cunambiguously undermined investor protection\u201d thanks to the vague legislative text that was on the table. \u201cWe live in a world where Amazon stock and U.S. treasuries are already digital,\u201d Gensler explained. \u201cSo many of the bills, literally, you could take the $24 trillion treasury market, put it on a blockchain ledger, and take it outside of the current regime\u201d of federal regulation. (This may sound a bit dry in Gensler\u2019s phrasing, but to be clear, it would be a radical and crazy outcome.)\n\nThe new Congress is looking again at crypto-specific legislation, but Gensler believes that the SEC has all of the legal tools that it needs. Over the course of our discussion, he articulated a straightforward view of the agency\u2019s reach \u2014 that pretty much every sort of crypto transaction already falls under the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction except spot transactions in bitcoin itself and the actual purchase or sale of goods or services with cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cEverything other than bitcoin,\u201d Gensler told me, \u201cyou can find a website, you can find a group of entrepreneurs, they might set up their legal entities in a tax haven offshore, they might have a foundation, they might lawyer it up to try to arbitrage and make it hard jurisdictionally or so forth.\u201d In other words, there are people behind these cryptocurrencies using a variety of complex and legally opaque mechanisms, but at the most basic level, they are trying to promote their tokens and entice investors. (Bitcoin, because of its unique history and creation story, is fundamentally different from other crypto projects in this respect.)\n\n\u201cThey might drop their tokens overseas at first and contend or pretend that it\u2019s going to take six months before they come back to the U.S.,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut at the core,\u201d he argued, \u201cthese tokens are securities because there\u2019s a group in the middle and the public is anticipating profits based on that group.\u201d The claim that crypto investors are hoping to profit based on the efforts of those intermediaries \u2014 in much the same way that stockholders in public companies hope to see their investments appreciate over time \u2014 is central to Gensler\u2019s position that, as a legal matter, these are actually transactions in securities that fall within the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nAs a matter of securities law, Gensler\u2019s view is not that hard to understand, though it is still being tested in the courts. The agency racked up a significant win last November, but there are other pending legal rulings that are eagerly awaited by industry observers, and there is a well-resourced crypto lobby that is not likely to back down anytime soon.\n\nFor now, the SEC has emerged as the industry\u2019s primary civil regulator, whether crypto advocates like it or not \u2014 but there are still plenty of big questions about what the agency has been up to in recent years and what its current enforcement strategy will actually achieve. Arguably the federal government\u2019s actions \u2014 including those of the SEC \u2014 didn\u2019t do much to prevent the loss of trillions of dollars in value over the last year, potentially impacting tens of millions of Americans who hold crypto assets in some form.\n\nGensler was extremely diplomatic about it when we spoke, but a large part of this mess is attributable to the Trump administration\u2019s extremely lax approach to financial fraud and regulation, as well as the credulousness of the industry\u2019s supporters in Congress. \u201cIn terms of policy-makers around the globe,\u201d Gensler explained, \u201cyou had this ascendancy in the crypto market during the COVID period and low interest rates,\u201d during which time the market grew \u201cfrom $250 billion to $3 trillion.\u201d\n\nCapitol Hill was also an important player in the mess. Many members of Congress \u2014 \u201cgood faith, hardworking members of Congress,\u201d Gensler was quick to add \u2014 felt compelled to meet with industry advocates and hear them out about the supposed financial revolution that they were ushering in. According to Gensler, members of Congress \u201cwere hearing about crypto increasingly because the retail public was also caught up\u201d thanks to things like Super Bowl advertising and support from celebrities like Kim Kardashian. In the downturn that followed, Gensler\u2019s agency has brought charges against various high-profile crypto opportunists, including Kardashian, who settled an enforcement action last October.\n\nGensler has said that the \u201croadway\u201d or \u201crunway\u201d for crypto firms that are not registered with the SEC is \u201cgetting shorter,\u201d but the metaphor is an odd one. The planes are already in the air, so the agency is really trying to ground them.\n\nThat explains a series of significant moves by the agency since the start of the year \u2014 including a major enforcement action against two prominent crypto firms based on an unregistered crypto asset lending program; a recent settlement with a crypto exchange based on an industry practice known as \u201cstaking\u201d; and notice of a potential enforcement action against a stablecoin issuer whose product is affiliated with Binance.\n\nGensler broadly referred to these kinds of firms, which seem to differ endlessly in their offerings and corporate structures, as \u201cstorefronts\u201d that are providing services to the public \u201cin a way that\u2019s commingled and is rife with conflicts.\u201d He argued that many of them combine functions that would have to be legally disaggregated in traditionally regulated markets, including roles that would ordinarily be separated among some combination of exchanges, lenders, market-makers, broker-dealers, investment advisers, and custodians.\n\n\u201cThe conflicts in these storefronts,\u201d Gensler told me, \u201cwe do not allow in traditional finance, we don\u2019t allow in the securities markets, we don\u2019t allow it in the commercial banking markets, and we don\u2019t allow it in crypto because these storefronts are fundamentally and generally noncompliant with the securities laws as we know them.\u201d He argued that network effects have made \u201ca small handful of storefronts\u201d particularly important, but \u201cwhether they call themselves lending or staking as a service or exchanges, they\u2019re bringing together millions of customers.\u201d\n\nOn its face, the idea that an increase in SEC registrations and filings from crypto companies will somehow markedly improve the integrity and resilience of this market seems dubious. Last February, the crypto lender BlockFi agreed to register with the SEC at the agency\u2019s urging, paid a $100 million fine, and then went bankrupt in November. The stark turn of events seemed to reflect, at least in part, the fact that the underlying crypto asset class is both novel and unstable, and that this is not an industry with consistent and widely accepted valuation, marking, or disclosure conventions.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the implosion of BlockFi seemed to reflect the legal and practical limits of the SEC\u2019s strategy to force more crypto firms to register with the agency. That is because companies that register with the SEC may have to satisfy more detailed and burdensome disclosure requirements, but that does not mean that those companies or their business models will magically become more stable or financially sound.\n\nThe unstated premise of the SEC\u2019s current enforcement push appears to be that if the government can broadly stigmatize the industry and market participants, then ordinary people \u2014 the retail investors all over the world who have gotten swept up in the crypto frenzy of recent years \u2014 might think long and hard about whether to hold these assets in any form. It is a message that federal regulators recently delivered directly to the banking industry, warning them not to issue or hold any crypto assets because doing so would be \u201chighly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\u201d\n\nI asked Gensler whether federal regulators with consumer-facing responsibilities should send a comparable message to retail investors, but he gently resisted. \u201cI\u2019m in a job where I\u2019m supposed to be merit neutral in terms of what risk investors want to take,\u201d he told me at one point, \u201cbut not neutral towards the investor protection \u2014 the full, fair, and truthful disclosure you get when you\u2019re investing in a security.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most telling answer I got from Gensler over the course of our discussion was when I asked him to explain the legitimate use case for crypto: What is the actual point of this new sector, and could it actually provide a valuable economic or financial service for ordinary people and the global economy?\n\nGensler was careful to draw a sharp distinction between two types of supposed innovations promoted by crypto\u2019s earliest advocates. The first is the idea of a distributed accounting ledger \u2014 the blockchain technology that came into the world with Bitcoin\u2019s invention \u2014 that is in theory more transparent, accessible, and resilient against theft and cyberattacks than centralized ledgers. Gensler clearly admired the technical creation. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s very rare that you need that, but it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real innovation.\u201d\n\nThe second, of course, is the notion that cryptocurrencies might actually provide a useful store of value or alternative payment mechanism, and on that point, Gensler appeared to be much less impressed.\n\n\u201cHistory tells us throughout \u2014 through antiquity to now \u2014 that economies coalesce around one monetary unit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a network effect to having one unit that we humans accept as a medium of exchange and unit of account \u2014 a store of value \u2014 one unit. The two things governments do since Genghis Khan,\u201d he observed, \u201cis basically say, \u2018This is what\u2019s accepted for your taxes, and it\u2019s accepted for all debts, public and private.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much economic use for a micro-currency, and we haven\u2019t seen one in centuries,\u201d Gensler said. \u201cMost of these tokens will fail, because the question is about these economics. What\u2019s the \u2018there\u2019 there?\u201d\n\nIt was a diplomatic answer for someone who is tasked with reigning in a well-funded and well-lawyered industry that many people believe is generally useless and economically wasteful. Here is a simpler way of thinking about it if you are an ordinary investor who bought \u201cshitcoins\u201d in recent years, perhaps because of the celebrity endorsements, the high-profile ads, or plain-old fear of missing out: Get out while you can."
