A year-to-date Bitcoin jump that reached 84% in mid-April has cooled to 67%."

        "content": "Canadian Bitcoin exchange, Bull Bitcoin, has launched a new no-KYC (know-your-customer) service which enables users to buy bitcoin with cash or debit card. Users can go to any Canadian Post office, scan the QR code generated on the Bull Bitcoin app, and pay in cash or via debit card.\n\nThe funds are automatically added to the user's Bull Bitcoin account within a few minutes. Transactions of up to ~$745 ($999.99 CAD) can be made per transaction, with no KYC required. The exchange has a fee of 2% for no-KYC sats, the cheapest of any such service in Canada, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, while Bull Bitcoin's on-chain withdrawals remain free.\n\nCanadian regulations state that Bitcoin exchanges must perform KYC and keep transaction records for all purchases above $1,000 CAD. Bull Bitcoin states that its privacy policy complies with the fair information principles in the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA), which prevents it from collecting information that is not needed for a legitimate purpose.\n\nWith no risk of chargeback for cash and debit card transactions, the company states that it has no legitimate reason to ask for KYC.\n\nBull Bitcoin aims to offer cash bitcoin purchases due to customer demand, and for those without access to bank accounts. The company also aims to attract migrant workers for remittances and users who want to limit the amount of personal information they give to trusted third parties. In addition, cash and debit card transactions are not subject to fraudulent chargebacks, unlike bank transfers and e-transfers. The process of funding accounts with cash or debit cards is also faster and more convenient.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin fees have hit a two-year high\u2014and they\u2019re continuing to climb fast.\n\nData from Bitinfocharts shows that the current average price to make a transaction on the Bitcoin network stands at $31.14.\n\nThe last time it was that high was back in April 2021 after they touched an all-time high of nearly $63 then dropped down again.\n\nSome even highlighted on Twitter how surging fees are hurting those using Bitcoin for everyday transactions: Marce Romero said that a $100 transaction in El Salvador cost over $20 to complete, adding that those using the network for \"fkn jpegs\" (referring to NFTs) should think twice\u2014insinuating that there are more important use cases for using Bitcoin.\n\nI\u2019m in El Salvador \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfb right now. Just witnessed a cash withdrawal via #btc This individual now had to pay $20 in fees for getting $100 out in a country where the avg. salary is $300-350 I want you to think about this when enabling gambling on fkn jpegs or meme coins. This is\u2026 pic.twitter.com/RTVLqG7DNn \u2014 Marce Romero (@MarceMR19) May 8, 2023\n\nWhy are they so high right now? If you want to make a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, you need to get it approved by a miner.\n\nMiners use powerful computers (usually industrial-sized operations) to solve complex problems which in turn validate transactions. They are then rewarded in Bitcoin for their work.\n\nIf the network is busy you\u2019ll have to pay more to get the job done\u2014that's the transaction fee. And it looks like a lot of people are using the Bitcoin network right now.\n\nSome have said that the current clogged network is down to the surge in interest in Ordinals, a protocol used for minting NFT-like assets on Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Transaction Fees Surpass Block Rewards for the First Time Since 2017\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are options for those not wanting to pay much when sending or receiving the biggest cryptocurrency: When making a Bitcoin payment, you have the option of paying lower fees. Though by doing so, you risk waiting around for hours as miners prioritize more lucrative transactions.\n\nBitcoiners can even choose to pay no transaction fee\u2014but miners may completely ignore such transactions and it will never reach its destination.\n\nThe Lightning Network is another option for lower fees: the \"second-layer solution\" speeds up transactions by skirting the main Bitcoin blockchain. Major businesses like Jack Dorsey-backed Spiral and MicroStrategy are trying to make it mainstream."

        "content": "Production was 35.59 Bitcoin\n\nOperations achieved 80.9 BTC/EH efficiency\n\nUptime was 94% For April 2023\n\nToronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - May 9, 2023) - Sphere 3D Corp. (NASDAQ: ANY) (\"Sphere 3D\" or the \"Company\"), dedicated to becoming the leading carbon-neutral Bitcoin mining company operating at an industrial scale, provides results of its Bitcoin mining operation for the month ended April 30, 2023.\n\nCEO Comments\n\n\"April was a pivotal month for Sphere 3D. We deployed the 4,400 miners we received in January to Rebel Mining for energization in May. We are well on our way to have 1.5EH/s online by the end of 2Q23. Rebel Mining was able to test, prep and install all miners in April.\" Said Patricia Trompeter, CEO of Sphere 3D. \"We were able to bring 3,900 of these miners online May 1st with the remainder planned for the weeks following.\"\n\nCompute North Update\n\nThere has not been a lot of movement in the Compute North bankruptcy. We continue to work with Compute North and their bankruptcy lawyers for the return of our deposit through the Chapter 11 process. As previously disclosed, we filed our financial claim with the US Bankruptcy Court in February 2023, and must wait for the process to continue.\n\nMiner Delivery Update\n\nWe deployed 4,400 miners to Rebel Mining's Missouri site for energization. Curently, 3,900 are hashing as of May 1 and the remaining 500 will be in the coming weeks. We expect to have additional hashrate coming online at Lancium's Texas location beginning in May and anticipate the majority of these to be hashing by mid-June. Finally, we expect to deploy the remaining fleet to an existing host in the next 60 days. With deployments above, we will have successfully placed the majority of our fleet.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/1705/165322_38bd147e44337bfb_002full.jpg\n\nCore Scientific Update\n\nAs previously disclosed by the Company, Sphere 3D filed an arbitration request against Core Scientific (\"Core\") on its claim for the non-refunded portion of the Company's advanced deposits. Core subsequently filed for restructuring under Chapter 11 on December 21, 2022, citing burdensome debt obligations as a result of rising energy prices and the decline in the price of bitcoin. In recent publicly filed documents, it appears that Core is closer to stabilizing their operations. We continue to work with our litigators and the US Bankruptcy court to monitor the progress. Sphere 3D has engaged counsel and is vigorously pursuing every available option to recover its funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nGryphon Update\n\nOn April 7, 2023, Sphere filed a suit against Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc (\"Gryphon\") in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Sphere alleges, among other things, that Gryphon materially breached its obligations to Sphere, both its contractual duties under a Master Services Agreemented dated August 19, 2021, and its fiduciary duties as a custodian of Sphere's assets. The litigation is at an early stage. Sphere intends to vigorously prosecute the action.\n\nBitcoin Production and Holdings Update\n\nIn April 2023, Sphere 3D produced 35.59 Bitcoin, or 1.15 per day. Sphere 3D's mining fleet operated at 80.9 BTC/EH efficiency.\n\nDuring April 2023, the Company employed a hybrid strategy of liquidating during bitcoin price upswings and HODL for the remainder of its holdings. The Company used approximately 41.3 Bitcoin during the month to fund working capital, and prepaid hosting deposits for our S19J Pros.\n\nBitcoin held by the Company represents a fair market value of approximately $0.5 million based on the Bitcoin price of $28,598 on April 30, 2023. As of April 30, 2023, the Company was operating approximately 4,330 S19j Pros miners delivering a production capacity of approximately 446 PH/s.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/1705/165322_38bd147e44337bfb_0003full.jpg\n\nOther\n\nWe have seen Bitcoin stabilize over the first quarter. We believe this trend will continue over the next quarter as investors choose to move their money into Bitcoin given the recent instability of the banking system.\n\nSphere 3D closed a capital raise with LDA Capital which will fund our deposits to bring the remaining 7,000+ miners online.\n\nOur CEO, Patricia Trompeter, spent a day on The Hill with fellow colleagues in the Bitcoin industry educating Congressional staff on issues facing the Bitcoin industry while dispelling myths on Bitcoin and energy consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/1705/165322_38bd147e44337bfb_004full.jpg\n\nCEO Closing Remarks\n\n\"I am really excited about bringing the 4,400 miners online in the next couple weeks. We spent a significant amount of time in April deploying, testing and installing these miners. We will almost double our Peta Hash as of May 1st and continue to build our fleet in the weeks coming.
