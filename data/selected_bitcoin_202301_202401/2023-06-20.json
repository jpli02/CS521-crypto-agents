        "content": "BlackRock Inc.\u2019s surprise application for a spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has a silver lining for Grayscale Investments LLC.\n\nThe $16.9 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (ticker GBTC) has outperformed the cryptocurrency itself in the days since the world\u2019s largest ETF issuer applied for the iShares Bitcoin Trust last week. As a result, GBTC\u2019s discount to its underlying Bitcoin holdings has narrowed to about 37%, versus 44% a week ago."

        "content": "A crypto exchange backed by financial giants Charles Schwab , Fidelity Digital Assets and Citadel Securities has officially launched trading in four crypto assets, the company said Tuesday.\n\nEDX Markets first announced its launch plans for a \"non-custodial\" exchange in September, about two months before the collapse of FTX. Paradigm, Sequoia Capital and Virtu Financial are among the other early backers.\n\nThe announcement comes days after BlackRock filed an application to launch what would be the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S., confirmation that despite the crypto industry's black eye from FTX and other bad actors in 2022, and the chill from U.S. regulators this year, long-term institutional interest has not diminished.\n\nThe EDX exchange allows trading of bitcoin , ether , litecoin and bitcoin cash , none of which were named \"crypto asset securities\" in the lawsuits the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought against Binance and Coinbase two weeks ago.\n\nEDX has said it strives to \"meet the needs of the world's largest and most sophisticated financial institutions,\" many of which remain crypto curious but skeptical of centralized crypto services providers, if not because of the failures of many in 2022, then because of the regulatory uncertainty the remaining players now find themselves in.\n\nTo quell any fears about misuse of funds, EDX plans to operate as a \"non-custodial\" exchange, meaning that rather than handling customer assets directly, it will act as a platform on which a network of firms can execute and settle trades between crypto assets and fiat currencies.\n\nEDX also has plans to launch a clearinghouse business this year to facilitate the settlement process but will keep customer assets held at third-party banks and a crypto custodian.\n\nThe company also announced it has closed a second funding round with new investors, including the options-exchange operator Miami International Holdings and affiliates of proprietary trading firms DV Trading, GTS, GSR and Hudson River Trading."

Many have speculated about the timing of BlackRock's move, particularly with Coinbase as its crypto custody partner.\n\nBitcoin rose more than 5% to $28,002.18, its highest level since early May, according to Coin Metrics.

In more recent years, the firm has opened the Fidelity Digital Assets division, created a commission-free retail investing app called Fidelity Crypto, and began offering 401(k) investors access to cryptocurrencies (an option that needs to be made available by employers).\n\nMany financial incumbents are keen to show enthusiasm for blockchain technology and the ways it can advance old financial infrastructure. Most are quieter, however, about their views on crypto investing.\n\nWith big names like BlackRock and Fidelity putting their crypto commitments on display, investors were optimistic Tuesday that some of the reputational risk of conducting any kind of crypto business \u2013 which for some investors has been a mental barrier to buying bitcoin \u2013 could start to fade.\n\nBitcoin has struggled to break out of a narrow trading range this quarter but has yet to fall meaningfully under $25,000. Tuesday's big move pushed its monthly gains into the green. It's now up 69% this year."

The requested asset seizures are a window into the wealth amassed by Tate, which is a key part of his online person and has loomed large in the criminal case against him.\n\nTate, a social media influencer best known for his misogynistic messaging, was arrested in December and placed in a Romanian jail while officials investigated human-trafficking and sexual assault allegations against him. He has been under house arrest since March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe indictment includes Tate, his brother Tristan Tate, and two associates, all of whom face the same charges. The indictment also names seven victims who were recruited through the \"loverboy method,\" the BBC reported \u2014 the method of using promises of love and marriage to manipulate women into sex work. All four maintain their innocence.\n\nReports of charges against the group describe a bleak world in which women made pornography for Tate under duress, with Tate's associates, Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu, threatening to beat the women if they did not comply. Per Reuters, a 61-page court file said Naghel and Radu took half the money the women made via OnlyFans accounts, and also fined the women if they were late or sniffled on camera.\n\nThe file, made by Romanian prosecutors, also allege these women were transformed \"into slaves,\" and one was raped by Tate twice.\n\nTate's assets that DIICOT has asked to seize includes just over 21 bitcoin, a DIICOT spokesperson confirmed to Insider. That amount of bitcoin is worth around $560,000 as of June 20. The assets could be used to compensate victims if he's convicted, Romanian authorities previously told Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome auto-translate software, including Google Translate, erroneously suggested that a much larger amount of Bitcoin worth $384 million had been seized, due to an error in interpreting the original Romanian.\n\nTate's wealth has been part of the investigation since the beginning. He was denied bail by a judge several times between January and March, because he was deemed a flight risk.\n\nThe judge in the case explained his decision to force the Tates to stay in jail, arguing that their wealth meant it was possible they would try and escape.\n\n\"The possibility that the suspects would evade investigation, leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition given their financial possibilities and public comments to that regard cannot be ignored,\" the judge said, according to Euro News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTate's boasting about his money are just some of the public statements he's made that could work against him in court. Over the years he has willingly described his tactics recruiting women, came close to endorsing rape, and said he moved to Romania because \"corruption is far more accessible.\"\n\nWhile he was incarcerated, Tate continued communicating with his fans \u2014 most of whom are young boys and men \u2014 through his newsletter, complaining of poor conditions, including lice and cockroaches in his cell.\n\nThe BBC reported that the trial is expected to last several years, and a Romanian judge has 60 days to view all the evidence before then.\n\nTate's spokesperson told the BBC: \"We embrace the opportunity it presents to demonstrate their innocence.\""
