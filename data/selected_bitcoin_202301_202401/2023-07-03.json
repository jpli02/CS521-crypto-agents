Bitcoin has surged 90% this year, with gains in the past few weeks spurred by renewed speculation that an ETF that invests directly in the cryptoasset will eventually be approved in the US."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell and Ether rose during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, while most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization strengthened. Investor sentiment remained strong after the wave of institutional interest in crypto from a raft of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the final weeks of June.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin breaches US$31,195 following Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nBitcoin slips, Ether inches up, top 10 cryptos in the green\n\nBitcoin inched down 0.31% from 6:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$30,632. Ether gained 0.4% in the same period to trade at US$1,963, floating above US$1,900 since Sunday.\n\nCrypto investors remained optimistic after numerous spot Bitcoin ETF applications in June. Among the latest institutional players to join the race, asset management giant Fidelity filed a spot Bitcoin ETF application last week.\n\nThe U.S. regulator that approves ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission, on Friday indicated it was unimpressed by the Bitcoin ETF applications by financial heavyweights such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that a race is currently underway among institutional firms to get a Bitcoin ETF approved. Whether such an ETF will be approved soon and which one will be the first is known only to Mr Gensler, but it is safe to say that news of an approved ETF will have a positive impact on the Bitcoin price in both the short and long term,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cAn ETF will significantly lower the barriers to exposure to Bitcoin by providing an easily accessible investment vehicle and thus boosting demand for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nPolkadot\u2019s Dot token was the day\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 10, rising 4.48% to US$5.50, followed by Ether that increased 2.43% in the past 24 hours. The XRP token was the only one in the red, inching down 0.02% to US$0.4824.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 1.18% to US$1.21 trillion and market volume increased 20.72% to US$31.55 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales fall, Ethereum NFT sales gain\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.16% to 2,761.68 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and dropped 5.11% during the week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales fell 15.56% to US$2.57 million, as sales for Uncategorized Ordinals fell 34.38% to US$1.25 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 7.54% to US$24.96 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 1.76% to US$5.35 million, while Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales inched up 1.69% to US$2.4 million.\n\nAzuki sales decreased 19.19% to US$1.89 million, after the new Azuki Elementals collection was criticized for being too similar to the original.\n\n\u201cBrutal weekend for NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cIt might be easy to point to Azuki\u2019s Elementals mint as the catalyst still, but lowering average sales and floor prices in top collections prior to Elementals mint showed that we were on the cusp of another free fall.\u201d\n\nThe Azuki Elementals collection began minting last Tuesday and sold out in 15 minutes, but left collectors disappointed as the latest collection looked almost the same as the original.\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast CAR NFT Composite was the only one in the green, inching up 0.84% to 967.02 points.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures rise on signs of easing U.S.-China tension\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong ahead of U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s trip to Beijing Wednesday to deepen communication between the two biggest global economies.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 1.7% and the Shenzhen Component Index inched up 0.59%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index rose 2.06% and the Shanghai Composite strengthened 1.31%.\n\nInvestor sentiment was bolstered by comments from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who told CNN on Tuesday that U.S. inflation could fall to the Fed\u2019s 2% target by 2025. But he also cautioned of a \u201chigher probability of a mild recession.\u201d\n\nMost U.S. stock futures strengthened during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, after falling U.S. inflation bolstered hopes of a less hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 futures index inched up 0.061%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures strengthened 0.29% but the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.11%.\n\nInvestors now await the release of the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index and S&P Global Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index for June, scheduled for Monday.\n\nInvestors are expecting more interest rate hikes this year in the U.S. following reiterated warnings from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in speeches last week in Europe that inflation has yet to be brought under control.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on July 26 and predicts only a 12.6% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\nSee related article: EU publishes draft bill for digital euro and cash payments\n\nUpdates with equities section"

        "content": "Bitcoin climbed above US$31,000 in Tuesday morning trading in Asia after Blackrock refiled a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application in the U.S. after the regulator criticised an earlier filing, suggesting the world\u2019s biggest money manager is determined to take a lead in cryptocurrency markets. Ethereum also logged gains amid institutional interest, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Polygon led the winners and Litecoin the losers.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 1.83% over the last 24 hours to US$31,142 at 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 2.85% for the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached a high of US$31,371 early Tuesday morning, the highest since June 2022.\n\nBlackRock submitted an amended application for a spot Bitcoin ETF on Monday, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said BlackRock\u2019s original filing was inadequate. BlackRock indicated in the new filing that Coinbase, the custodian of the proposed ETF\u2019s Bitcoin holdings, will provide market surveillance to support the ETF, according to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral other financial institutions have filed Bitcoin ETF applications despite a crackdown last month by the SEC, which filed lawsuits against Binance.US and Coinbase last month for allegedly violating securities laws in trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn emailed comments, Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of digital asset exchange BTSE, said the SEC criticism of the application caused some selling last week, but \u201cinvestors remain quietly optimistic about future approvals.\u201d\n\nEther gained 1.18% to US$1,954.24, and added 5.23% for the week.\n\nBitcoin and Ether have both seen increased interest from financial institutions in the past week, according to a Monday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin-linked digital asset investment products saw net inflows of around US$123 million in the week ending June 30, while Ethereum-linked products had net inflows of around US$2.7 million. Digital asset investment products have seen two weeks of net inflows since June 19, after logging 9 weeks of consecutive outflows.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin tokens traded higher in the past 24 hours, with Polygon\u2019s Matic token spearheading the rally with a gain of 4.60% to US$0.7119. It\u2019s up 10.18% for the week despite the U.K.-based fintech neobank and crypto exchange Revolut plans to delist Polygon, Solana and Cardano tokens for its U.S. users in September, according to a report by the Block on Monday.\n\nLitecoin led the losers in a potential price correction, falling 5.83% to US$106.69. It still logged weekly gains of 22.47% driven higher by the token\u2019s upcoming third halving event on August 2, which will make the token scarcer.\n\nLitecoin investors also received a boost after the token was selected to trade on the newly established EDX Markets exchange, which opened on June 20 and is backed by Wall Street heavyweights, including Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.28% to US$1.22 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 26.34% to US$37.86 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT volumes gain\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.08% in the 24 hours to 09:40 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,750, down 5.06% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets logged moderate increases.\n\nNFT trading volume on Ethereum rose 18.72% in the past 24 hours to US$27.29 million, according to CryptoSlam data, while Polygon\u2019s volumes surged 121.63% to more than US$1.89 million. Trading volumes also rose on the Bitcoin, Solana and BNB Chain networks.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the second largest NFT collection by market cap, saw trading volume jump 52.56% to US$4.98 million, with Ethereum-based NFT collections Azuki and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) ranking the second and the third.\n\n\u201cA bit of a rebound today on the ETH side, which is in the green for the first time in days. Top collections like Bean, Azuki, and MAYC have had increases in their floor prices 7-20% and even BAYC has slowed its decline,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nHowever, the floor prices of some major NFT collections are still holding considerable losses for the past week, with BAYC floor price falling over 20% in the past seven days and Azuki sliding more than 50% over the same period, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nAzuki Elementals are a collection of 20,000 NFTs launched on June 27 as a spin-off of the original Azuki collection. While the Elementals sold out within 15 minutes, collectors started to complain that the supposed new NFTs looked almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nAzuki DAO, a community of dissatisfied Azuki holders, was formed last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Azuki creator Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO to \u201cpromote the growth of the entire Azuki community.\u201d\n\n\u201cNFT platforms have experienced an increase in trading volume in recent days, while the prices of blue-chip NFTs have declined,\u201d said Gracy Chen, managing director at digital asset trading platform Bitget, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is undergoing a major adjustment, but a decline does not necessarily indicate the decline of the entire industry,\u201d said Chen. \u201cAs NFT derivatives, including lending, indexes, perpetual contracts, and other products, are gaining traction, price fluctuations become more pronounced in the short term.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures dip\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures inched down 0.01%, S&P 500 futures dipped 0.04%, and Nasdaq futures fell 0.12%. The three major U.S. indexes closed higher in the regular Monday session, shortened ahead of the July 4 public holiday when the market is closed.\n\nIn Asia, mainland China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index closed 1.31% higher on Monday, despite the country\u2019s softening manufacturing recovery. South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 1.49%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the gainers in the region with a 1.7% increase, according to CNBC on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) dropped to 46.0 in June, the lowest since May 2020, according to a Monday report by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM). A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing and below 50 a contraction.\n\n\u201cCompanies reduced production and began using layoffs to manage head counts, to a greater extent than in prior months, amid mixed sentiment about when significant growth will return,\u201d wrote ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee Chair Timothy Fiore in the report.\n\nThe June PMI is the eighth consecutive month of contraction and is lower than the projection of 47.0, raising concerns about a recession, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. The Fed releases its June meeting minutes on Wednesday, where it decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 89.9% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 87.4% on Monday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 10.1%.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"
