        "content": "The world's largest cryptocurrency hit an intraday high of $45,913.30 early Tuesday morning, according to Coin Metrics. That was its highest level since April 5, 2022, and the first time it has traded above the $45,000 mark since then. It was last higher by nearly 3%, trading at $44,952.89.\n\nBitcoin surged to start 2024, topping $45,000 for the first time since April 2022 amid an uptick in geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea and growing optimism around a potential bitcoin exchange-traded fund approval.\n\nThe increase showed bitcoin's role as a hedge against uncertainty, which investors became familiar with last year. Over the weekend, a Maersk vessel came under attack by four small boats crewed by Houthi militants, who are based in Yemen and backed by Iran.\n\nMost of the six-month rally in bitcoin is tied to the potential ETF, but before that narrative came into play, bitcoin's biggest catalyst was the regional banking crisis in the U.S. That led to bitcoin's first big gain of the year, allowing the cryptocurrency to shine as an alternative to the legacy system in place and hedge against uncertainty.\n\nThe move also comes amid continued excitement among traders that the U.S. could approve the first bitcoin ETF. This would allow investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin without having to own the cryptocurrency directly, likely appealing to larger institutional investors.\n\nOn Friday, BlackRock and other potential issuers updated the registration forms for their proposed bitcoin ETFs, including names of authorized participants. Investors are reading that extra detail as evidence that a decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is coming soon. Many industry experts expect the funds to be approved in January.\n\nThe continued price gains for bitcoin follow 2023's hot streak, when the price of the digital coin rose 157% \u2014 and many expect the pop to continue.\n\nInvestors have high hopes for bitcoin in 2024. A decision on an ETF is widely expected to come sometime in January. Shortly after, in the spring, the Bitcoin halving is expected to take place, an event that historically has preceded steep price increases. Plus, Fed officials are anticipating at least three interest rate cuts this year after almost two years of hikes that have hurt the cryptocurrency.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies also ticked higher Tuesday. Ether traded at around $2,367, up roughly 1%.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "title": "Why the Bitcoin Price Will Rise or Fall on the ETF Ruling - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin is up over 150% in 2023, and that momentum has captured hearts and minds on Wall Street, resulting in a landmark rush for its firms to launch the first-ever Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAll eyes are now on the upcoming decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, slated for January 10.\n\nIf the past is any indication, the ruling will have a significant impact on Bitcoin's price, though whether positive or negative remains to be seen.\n\nPotential for a Price Rise\n\nProponents of a Bitcoin ETF argue that its approval by the SEC would open the door to a flood of institutional and retail investments, driving the price of Bitcoin to new heights.\n\nHistory offers a glimpse into how expectations surrounding ETFs have affected Bitcoin's price.\n\nIn 2017, the price of Bitcoin surged to over $1,400, driven in part by the anticipation of the first Bitcoin ETF. This was up from lows in the $600 range just the year before.\n\nInvestors believed then that the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF would make it easier for institutional money to enter the market, leading to a frenzy of buying. However, the SEC ultimately rejected the proposal, causing a sharp decline in Bitcoin's price.\n\nWithin days, the price was trading back below $1,000.\n\nUltimately, however, the arrival of Bitcoin futures would bring new attention in 2017, the market surging above $20,000 that year.\n\nPrice increase from CME Bitcoin futures announcement to listing.\n\nElsewhere, we can fast forward to 2021, when Bitcoin once again rallied to all-time highs, reaching over $60,000.\n\nThis time, the rally was partly fueled by the successful launch of Bitcoin futures ETFs in Canada and Europe. These ETFs allowed investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the cryptocurrency directly. The anticipation of a similar product in the U.S. contributed to the bullish sentiment.\n\nFinally, in the wake of fake news of an ETF approval earlier this year, Bitcoin's price rose by several thousand dollars in minutes, a move that suggests upside volatility on approval is likely.\n\nThe Bitcoin price spikes on fake news of an ETF approval.\n\nPotential for a Price Fall\n\nOn the flip side, there are arguments suggesting that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could lead to a price correction.\n\nSome market experts fear that the ETF could become a target for short sellers, leading to increased volatility, or that the ETF could be a \"sell the news event.\"\n\nMoreover, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF may bring greater regulatory scrutiny to the cryptocurrency market as a whole. This heightened oversight could lead to increased taxation, reporting requirements, and potential restrictions on the use of Bitcoin, which may dampen enthusiasm among investors.\n\nAdditionally, some believe the market may already have priced in the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF approval, and any decision to deny it might lead to disappointment and a sell-off similar to what was witnessed in 2017 when the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF was rejected.\n\nBitcoin price sell-off after the ETF rejection in 2017.\n\nThe final decision by the SEC is eagerly awaited by the crypto community, but it's essential to remember that it is just one of many factors influencing Bitcoin's price.\n\nMarket sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and geopolitical events will also play their part in shaping the coin's future.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin's price is at a crossroads as investors await the SEC's decision on the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile past instances have shown that ETF expectations can have a substantial impact on Bitcoin's price, it is crucial to consider the broader market dynamics. Whether Bitcoin's price rises or falls after the SEC ruling will depend on a multitude of factors, including how the market interprets and reacts to the decision.\n\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain, but it's undeniably a pivotal moment for the world's only decentralized cryptocurrency.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
