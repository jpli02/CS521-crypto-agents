        "title": "This Week in Coins: Bitcoin and Ethereum See Fourth Flat Week as TRON and Tether Surge - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "It was the fourth consecutive week of flat prices. A generally slow news cycle meant that market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum remained where they were last weekend.\n\nBitcoin depreciated a nominal 0.5% and currently trades at $26,815, while Ethereum rose 1% over the seven days and now enters the weekend at $1,829.\n\nOn Monday, an AI-generated photo depicting a fabricated explosion at the Pentagon briefly caused a selloff in stocks and Bitcoin.\n\nMarkets were decidedly flat across the board, with no top thirty cryptocurrency posting significant gains except TRON, which rallied 8% to $0.076778.\n\nTRON\u2019s rally this week appears to have been driven by the climbing market capitalization of the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin Tether (USTD), as the latter inches towards overtaking its all-time high of $83.2 billion, set in May last year.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, Tether may set a new high watermark any day now.\n\nTRON and USDT\u2019s joint rally appears to be linked to the fact that the majority of USDT, approximately $46 billion, is issued on Tron, surpassing the $36 billion on Ethereum. Recent data shows a steep rise in USDT on the TRON network throughout 2023 so far.\n\nThe biggest losses among cryptocurrencies this week were posted by Internet Computer (ICP), which fell 6% to $4.88, and Lido DAO (LDO), which dropped 7.1% to $1.96.\n\nRon DeSantis Banned CBDCs in Florida\u2014These States Could Be Next\n\nCoin politics\n\nCrypto is already a major talking point in Bitcoin-friendly Florida Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s campaign as he gets ready to run as the GOP\u2019s candidate in next year\u2019s U.S. presidential elections.\n\nDeSantis headlined an otherwise disastrous Twitter Spaces the day he announced his candidacy and told his host, Twitter/Tesla CEO Elon Musk, that Biden\u2019s administration \u201c[has] it out for Bitcoin, and if it continues for another four years, they\u2019ll probably end up killing it.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) released a report outlining policy recommendations for global crypto regulation as part of the public consultation process.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a nod to the fall of FTX, the IOSCO recommendations warn regulators about crypto companies \"combining certain functions in a single legal entity or group of affiliated entities,\u201d such as one entity running exchanges, trading firms, and custody businesses under one roof.\n\nOn Thursday, watchdog the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) released a report concluding that the industry\u2019s economic impact is minimal, but advising vigilance and policymaking that monitors leveraged trading and the industry\u2019s financial contagion risks.\n\nThat same day, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) issued a statement saying that cryptocurrencies must be clearly labeled as unregulated and both investors and investment firms should understand the financial risks involved in trading them."

        "title": "Crypto hater Peter Schiff to drop Bitcoin Ordinals NFT art collection - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In what seems like a parody but isn\u2019t, economist, gold proponent and vocal crypto skeptic Peter Schiff has unveiled a collaborative nonfungible token (NFT) art collection on the Bitcoin network that will soon go up for auction.\n\nThe reaction from the crypto community has been mixed, with people generally baffled, amused or welcoming \u2014 especially Ordinals proponents \u2014 with some keen to point out the apparent hypocrisy.\n\nits a hack right?\n\n\n\ndid i just teleport to a different timeline?\n\n\n\nim so confused \u2014 Deezy (@CryptoDmack) May 26, 2023\n\nFor years, Schiff has actively bashed crypto \u2014 especially Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 at any chance, with his arguments revolving around BTC being a Ponzi scheme with no inherent value.\n\nDespite all of that, Schiff unveiled the \u201cGolden Triumph\u201d NFT collection in a May 27 Twitter thread in collaboration with one of his \u201cfavorite artists,\u201d who goes by the pseudonym \u201cMarket Price.\u201c\n\n\u201cThis collaboration features the original painting \u2018Golden Triumph\u2019 as well as a series of prints and Ordinals inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain,\u201d he wrote.\n\nGolden Triumph consists of one physical painting on an oil linen canvas depicting a human hand holding a bar of gold, 50 prints on archival paper depicting the same image, and 50 digital versions inscribed as Ordinal NFTs on Bitcoin.\n\nThe collection will be sold via a two-part auction starting on June 2 and ending on June 9. For the Ordinals, the highest bidder will receive #1 of the collection, with the next 49 highest bidders receiving #2 to #50 in descending order.\n\nIt appears, however, that Schiff hasn\u2019t done a complete turnaround on BTC, but has woken up to a use case for blockchain technology: verifiable ownership of assets such as art via NFTs.\n\nCommenting on Schiff\u2019s tweet, Twitter user LoneStartBitcoin asked: \u201cSo... it\u2019s valuable to put your \u2018gold\u2019 inscriptions on Bitcoin, but bitcoin [BTC] itself is not valuable?.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Schiff responded.\n\nRelated: Peter Schiff blames \u2018too much gov\u2019t regulation\u2019 for worsening financial crisis\n\nAlongside his disdain for crypto, Schiff has also criticized NFTs on several occasions in the past.\n\nIn a blog post from March 2021, Schiff described NFTs as \u201cfake assets\u201d that offer nothing other than ownership of a digital image that can be \u201creplicated endlessly\u201d online.\n\n\u201cBut even as the owner of the image, you won\u2019t be able to control access to it. The file has been copied thousands of times, so anyone with access to the internet can look at it as much as you,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe sharp change in sentiment follows in a similar vein to former United States President Donald Trump, who has also aggressively slammed crypto on multiple occasions before getting involved with NFTs.\n\nIn December 2022, Trump teased a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d that supporters thought was politically related before unveiling the Trump Digital Trading Cards collection.\n\nMagazine: NFT Creator: Top 10 crypto artist Trevor Jones on being rich, rekt and rich again"

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals: A leap forward for the Bitcoin network\u2019s utility - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Rajagopal Menon\n\nBitcoin, the unrivaled titan of cryptocurrencies, has recently witnessed a burst of energy with the introduction of the ordinals protocol. This groundbreaking development has ignited fervent debate within the Bitcoin community, injecting a fresh dimension into the digital currency. So, what exactly are ordinals? Why are they causing such a stir? And what implications could they hold for the future of Bitcoin?\n\nTo fully grasp the significance of ordinals, let\u2019s start with a basic understanding of Bitcoin\u2019s structure. As most Bitcoin enthusiasts are aware, each Bitcoin is composed of 100 million satoshis, or SATs. Ordinals, however, revolutionise this notion by enabling the individual transmission of SATs with the option to attach supplementary data. This data can take various forms, ranging from text and images to videos. This process of associating data with SATs is known as inscription. Impressively, over 100,000 inscriptions have already been created since the inception of ordinals earlier this week.\n\nThe name \u201cordinals\u201d stems from the protocol\u2019s unique approach to numbering sets based on the order of their mining. Among these 100,000-plus inscriptions, notable examples include ordinal punks and ordinal penguins. Given the Bitcoin and broader crypto communities\u2019 proclivity for embracing and expanding on novel ideas, it is only reasonable to anticipate an influx of innovative and derivative concepts etched onto SATs. Crucially, these advancements have been made possible by the recent major upgrade to Bitcoin known as Taproot, which was implemented in late 2021.\n\nBut are these ordinals akin to NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on the Ethereum platform? The answer is both yes and no. While some distinctions can be drawn between ordinals and the familiar NFTs, the comparison holds merit. It is worth noting, however, that NFTs rely on smart contracts and often have their underlying assets hosted elsewhere, whereas ordinals are directly inscribed onto individual sets within blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the press release accompanying their launch, as cited in Bitcoin magazine, it was emphasised that \u201cordinals are fully on-chain and do not require a side chain or separate token. Inscriptions inherit the simplicity, immutability, security, and durability of Bitcoin itself.\u201d Furthermore, Casey Rodimore, the creator of ordinals, elucidated in an interview with Decrypt that \u201cthe ordinals protocol is just a system for numbering satoshis, giving individual sets a serial number, and then tracking them across transactions.\u201d\n\nEssentially, ordinals have unveiled a new use case for the Bitcoin network, extending its utility beyond the mere transfer of value. Inscribed sets now compete for block space alongside regular BTC transactions, leading to an increase in network fees. While this might not sound ideal, it is crucial to remember that these fees serve as vital incentives for miners to secure the network. As block rewards diminish over time, network fees will inevitably become the primary reason for committing hash power to Bitcoin. In this context, ordinals contribute additional functionality to Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, ordinals have not only propelled the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses to a record high of 44 million but have also ushered in a novel and unique chapter in Bitcoin\u2019s history. This innovation generates network activity without necessitating the classical transfer of coin volume for monetary purposes. Consequently, the user base has expanded, exerting upward pressure on the fee market beyond the conventional investment and monetary transfer use cases.\n\nHowever, not everyone in the Bitcoin community agrees with this innovation. Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and about as OG as they come, sees ordinals as a \u201cfrivolous waste of block space\u201d and objects to \u201cthe sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding\u201d that does not do anything efficient. This disagreement sums up the divide in the Bitcoin community, with some fervent and non-toxic Maxis like Adam and others believing that Bitcoin\u2019s relative simplicity and limitations to storing and transferring value should be preserved at all costs, while more progressive voices argue that Bitcoin needs to adapt in order to thrive and survive.\n\nThis fundamental argument is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, but one thing is for sure: ordinals are generating a lot of attention and debate within the Bitcoin community. This is a welcome change from the FUD that has been clouding the industry, and we can expect to hear more about ordinals and their impact on Bitcoin in the months and years to come.\n\nThe author is vice-president, WazirX\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe play-to-earn gaming craze might have faded, but believe it or not, there remains a slew of crypto-infused games out there that let you earn Bitcoin while you play\u2014and you don\u2019t have to buy any NFTs to get started.\n\nSolitaire is one of the most popular games to be injected full of Bitcoin rewards on iOS and Android, with no fewer than three competing takes that let you stack sats (or satoshis, a.k.a. 1/100,000,000 BTC) while stacking digital playing cards: THNDR Games\u2019 Club Bitcoin: Solitaire, Bling Financial\u2019s Bitcoin Solitaire, and Viker\u2019s Solitaire - Card Game 2023.\n\nAll three games are broadly similar, serving up a simple game of digital solitaire that\u2019s chock-full of obnoxious video ads. But all three games also truly do let you earn Bitcoin along the way and then withdraw it to a wallet. Keep your expectations in check, however: we\u2019re talking pennies\u2019 worth of BTC across hours of gameplay.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd I\u2019d know, because I played approximately two hours of each game to see how much Bitcoin I could earn from each. Here\u2019s a brief review of each game (played on iPhone), along with a verdict on which Bitcoin solitaire app is most worth your time and attention.\n\nClub Bitcoin: Solitaire\n\nTHNDR Games makes an array of Bitcoin-awarding mobile games, including Tetro Tiles, and its Club Bitcoin: Solitaire (iPhone, Android) is by far the most visually appealing of the bunch. It spruces up this very traditional card game with a little bit of visual panache, and the streamlined interface with one tap to send any card to its rightful pile feels intuitive and responsive.\n\nBut it\u2019s stingy with the sats. You earn tickets while playing, and those are put into prize draws that could earn you large-to-small bundles of satoshis. But after two hours of total gameplay, I\u2019d only earned 59 sats\u2026 that\u2019s less than $0.02 worth. Plus, you have to redeem the sats and withdraw them to a wallet within a few days, otherwise they disappear.\n\nClub Bitcoin: Solitaire by THNDR Games. Image: Decrypt\n\nClub Bitcoin was the most enjoyable of the trio in terms of look and feel, but also provided the least amount of rewards. Your mileage may vary, however. No matter how it shakes out, you\u2019ll still have to sit through some truly laborious video ads for scammy-looking mobile games.\n\nBitcoin Solitaire\n\nBling Financial is another publisher with a heap of crypto-tinged mobile games, and Bitcoin Solitaire (iPhone, Android)\u2014created with PlayDay Studios\u2014was by far the most generous game of this trio when it comes to earning satoshis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGranted, it\u2019s all relative: after two hours of play, I had earned enough \u201cBling Points\u201d to withdraw 339 satoshis, or about $0.09 worth. That\u2019s still basically nothing, but it\u2019s more than five times the amount of Bitcoin that I earned while playing Club Bitcoin, with a similar amount of obnoxious ads permeating the experience.\n\nBitcoin Solitaire by Bling/PlayDay. Image: Decrypt\n\nBling\u2019s Bitcoin Solitaire has a more spartan design than Club Bitcoin, but the interface is just as responsive and it serves up an enjoyable game of mobile solitaire. I noticed that I won a lot more games in Bitcoin Solitaire than the other two games, though. It feels tuned to go easy on you, but when you\u2019re coasting to victory and racking up sats, it\u2019s tough to complain.\n\nSolitaire - Card Game 2023\n\nThere\u2019s an odd discrepancy between the iPhone and Android versions: the iOS game has the bland title above, while the Android one has \u201cEarn Bitcoin\u201d in the title. But appearances are a bit deceiving here, as both games may ultimately earn you tiny amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nIn this case, Viker\u2019s take on solitaire is solid but not quite as streamlined as the others. A double tap is required on any card to send it to its rightful destination, which makes the flow a bit less speedy than in the other games, and the interface\u2014which includes a banner ad\u2014isn\u2019t nearly as punchy and stylish as in Club Bitcoin.\n\nSolitaire - Card Game 2023 by Viker. Image: Decrypt\n\nAll that said, this is a totally solid game of smartphone solitaire, with just about the same amount of clunky, time-consuming, full-screen video ads as the others. And overall, the payout puts this game right in the middle of the others\u2014I earned 122 satoshis in approximately two hours of gameplay, coming out to just over $0.03 worth of BTC.\n\nWhich should you play?\n\nAfter earning less than $0.15 total for six full hours of gameplay, it\u2019s fair to say that none of these games are likely to grant you any meaningful amount of cryptocurrency. If you care about solitaire gameplay most of all, then you can probably find a mobile rendition with more polish and less-intrusive ads.\n\nBut among games with crypto rewards, Bling\u2019s Bitcoin Solitaire hits the sweet spot. It\u2019s not the most stylish-looking of the bunch, but the gameplay is smooth and enjoyable and I earned the most BTC by far out of any of these games\u2026 even if it was barely a dime\u2019s worth."
