It\u2019s the next step in the process after the SEC last week opted against appealing the previous ruling, which it had lost."

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, U.S. government officials told The New York Times last week that they had been tracking the Wyoming operation for months. One official said that measures had been taken to mitigate potential intelligence collection but declined to elaborate. In addition, the mining company said it responded to queries from the federal investment committee."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Shoots Up on BlackRock (BLK) ETF Approval Rumor - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The race to launch a Bitcoin ETF has been getting a lot of eyeballs as it would give a regulated and orderly way to obtain exposure to Bitcoin price swings without actually owning the cryptocurrency. On Monday, Oct 16, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed the $30,000 mark on reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) approved BlackRock, Inc.\u2019s BLK application to launch a BTC ETF. The news turned out to be a rumor.\n\n\u201cThe iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF application is still under review by the SEC,\u201d a BlackRock spokesperson clarified. On this, the price of the benchmark crypto coin settled back down below $29000, falling sharply by about 8%. The SEC, too, gave a cryptic yet stern message on social media, stating, \"Careful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.\"\n\nHowever, the sharp uptick in the price of Bitcoin on these rumors has started speculations that an actual approval may not be far off. The regulations body has been struggling in recent days to keep the rising optimism about Bitcoin ETFs at bay, and the best it has been able to do is to delay passing its verdict on various applications. Traditional finance giants seem to have decided to go mainstream with crypto, and the market appears prepared for it.\n\nOf late, the major development in this next-stage crypto move has been the Court of Appeals siding with Grayscale in its lawsuit against the SEC. Previously, the SEC had denied Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The SEC had until Friday to appeal the judge\u2019s opinion that it had failed to provide a coherent explanation for its denial. But they did not take up that option in a significant act of omission. This will now pave the way for various companies from the traditional sector that are waiting for the SEC\u2019s approval to jump into the crypto fray.\n\nStory continues\n\nApart from BlackRock, which is probably the biggest player in the race, the SEC is currently reviewing applications from major investment companies like Invesco Ltd. IVZ and Franklin Resources, Inc. BEN. Invesco and Franklin Resources currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "SkyBridge Capital founder, Anthony Scaramucci has shed a bullish light on the future price trajectories of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and Algorand (CRYPTO: ALGO), suggesting hearty targets for these cryptocurrencies, detailing the intrinsic factors that could drive such a bullish trend.\n\nThis optimistic outlook comes just ahead of Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 14, which aims to delve into the evolving dynamics of digital assets. Discussions about these predictions by Scaramucci could form a riveting part of the narrative as industry experts explore the potential future of cryptocurrencies.\n\nScaramucci postulates a bullish scenario for Bitcoin, attributing his confidence to the post-halving cycle which historically propels a surge in demand, in an interview with Altcoin Daily.\n\nHe states, \u201cI believe six to 12 months after the halving cycle, there\u2019s no reason why Bitcoin couldn\u2019t be at $100,000. Just given what I know about demand and given what I know about the cycle and where the miners are, and so forth, plus, we may get some interest rate relief. That\u2019s a 3x bump.\u201d\n\nHis prediction reflects a tripling in Bitcoin\u2019s value, which he analogizes to the technological advancements that have historically witnessed such price surges.\n\nWhile Scaramucci admits to not being as intimately acquainted with Ethereum, he nonetheless holds a positive stance.\n\nAlso Read: Fed Governor Michelle Bowman Says Creation Of US CBDC 'Could Pose Significant Risks'\n\nHighlighting the technological improvements and the increasing utility that Ethereum offers, he said, \u201cCould Ethereum be $4,500 by then? Why not? You know it\u2019s a great utility. Speeds have improved. The layer-2s have helped it. Why not? Why couldn\u2019t it be $4,500? These things are maturing.\u201d\n\nHis optimism extends to Algorand, albeit with a tempered tone due to its current trading price. Despite the crypto\u2019s present modest trading range of around $0.09 to $0.10, Scaramucci sees potential for growth.\n\nHe envisions a path to $0.30 per token as Algorand continues to develop and garner adoption, especially from corporations enamored by its technology.\n\nHe adds, \u201cI\u2019m bullish. I thought at $1 it could have easily gotten to $5... but could Algorand from here... could it be a $0.30 token as they continue their development and continue the adoption of what they\u2019re doing and bringing in corporations that love the technology? I believe it can.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Binance.US Changes Terms: No More Direct Withdrawals Of US Dollars From Platform\n\nJoin Benzinga's Fintech Deal Day & Awards on Nov. 13 and Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 14 in New York City to stay updated on trends like AI, regulations, SEC actions and institutional adoption in the crypto space.
