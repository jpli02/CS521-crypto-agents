        "content": "BlackRock Met With SEC Officials To Discuss Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nRepresentatives from BlackRock and Nasdaq recently engaged in discussions with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the possibility of listing a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In a memo released by the SEC on November 20, it was revealed that BlackRock presented two potential redemption models for its iShares Bitcoin Trust: one involving in-kind transactions and the other using cash.\n\nThere is increasing speculation that the SEC may be nearing a decision on approving a spot Bitcoin ETF for U.S. markets. However, uncertainty surrounds the response of SEC officials and the likelihood of approval, given the history of delays and rejections in this area. During the same period, representatives from Grayscale also met with SEC officials, as they too seek to list their own Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock is among several firms that have submitted applications for spot crypto ETFs, awaiting a response from the SEC. Notable applicants include Fidelity, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Valkyrie, VanEck, and Bitwise. BlackRock initially applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange back in June.\n\nThe outcome of these meetings and the potential decision by the SEC regarding a spot Bitcoin ETF is being closely monitored by the cryptocurrency industry and investors.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Can You Buy a Car With Bitcoin? - MarketWatch",
        "content": "Bitcoin gained popularity as one of the first cryptocurrencies to enter the public domain. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that rely on blockchain encryption and lack the backing of any government\u2019s central bank. For this reason, many companies consider bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be somewhat risky to deal with.\n\nBitcoin, ethereum and other popular forms of cryptocurrency have attracted early adopters by offering rapid payments, a greater sense of privacy and the potential for a quick profit. That last point is important to note due to the general volatility of cryptocurrencies compared to the dollar. While there\u2019s a chance that owners will make a fast profit, they could lose money just as easily.\n\nCryptocurrency is appealing to investors who are willing to take major risks, but companies have been hesitant to join the trend. That\u2019s especially true of car dealerships, who have much more money to lose per transaction than the average business if cryptocurrency\u2019s value crashes.\n\nWhy Would Someone Buy a Car With Bitcoin?\n\nWhile cryptocurrency isn\u2019t popular yet among the general public, it has an extremely loyal following. Advocates of bitcoin payments point to the following as some key benefits:\n\nPayments are fast and secure\n\nLow or no transaction fees apply\n\nSensitive financial information remains private\n\nThe elimination of percentage-based transaction fees could potentially save some customers considerable money when making a purchase as large as a car. Yet while the reasons above may appeal to some, it\u2019s still relatively difficult to find dealerships that accept cryptocurrency payments."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Rate Hits All-time High, Shows Strong Network Ahead of Halving\n\nThe hash rate of Bitcoin has reached an all-time high level, demonstrating the network's increased resilience in preparation for the highly anticipated halving event next year. According to Blockchain.com, the total hash rate of Bitcoin reached 491 exahashes per second (TH/s) on Wednesday, indicating that mining machines worldwide are performing 491 quintillion hash computations every second.\n\nHash rate refers to the amount of computing power utilized per second, and higher hash rates make it more difficult for malicious actors to gain control of over 50% of the Bitcoin network. This surge in hash rate suggests a rise in mining activity as miners expand their operations and employ more machines to maximize their profits.\n\nHashing, which is the process of converting data into fixed-length character strings, plays a critical role in various Bitcoin network activities, including the creation of private keys for transactions\n\nWhile higher hash rates lead to increased energy consumption and costs for miners, the upcoming halving event, expected in April, has prompted miners to invest in more efficient machines, contributing to the rising hash rate. During the halving, the amount of newly minted Bitcoin awarded to miners is reduced by half every four years, which helps control the inflation of BTC. Despite past criticisms of Bitcoin's energy consumption, the rising hash rate highlights the ongoing efforts of miners to improve efficiency and sustainability within the industry.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

The company introduces a Thanksgiving Day promotion, including a $7 signup bonus for new users and a special Thanksgiving Rewards Event featuring tiered recharge rewards and referral gifts, enhancing the profitability and accessibility of crypto mining.\n\nLONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, Nov. 22, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nIn an exciting development in the cryptocurrency world, GlobaleCrypto , a leader in digital asset and cloud mining services, has announced new opportunities in Bitcoin mining, proving it to be highly profitable in 2023. This revelation is set to change the dynamics of earning through cryptocurrency.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Mining in the Current Landscape\n\nBitcoin mining, a process of using computational power to transact and secure the Bitcoin network, remains a vital component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This process involves miners verifying transactions, assembling them into \"blocks,\" and adding them to the blockchain, a task that requires solving complex computational puzzles known as proof of work. Successful miners are rewarded with new Bitcoins, making the endeavor highly lucrative, especially considering the current BTC/USD exchange rates.\n\nThe Profitability of Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining's profitability stems from its crucial role in maintaining the Bitcoin network's independence from centralized authorities. Every 10 minutes, miners confirm a block of transactions. The first to validate it earns a reward of 6.25 BTC, a significant sum given Bitcoin's current market value. However, the competitive nature of mining, driven by Bitcoin's value and the substantial rewards, necessitates significant investment in specialized hardware.\n\nGlobaleCrypto: A Game-Changer in Bitcoin Mining\n\nRecognizing the challenges of individual mining investments, GlobaleCrypto offers a compelling alternative with its cloud mining services .

        "title": "Binance users pull more than $1 billion from the exchange after CEO leaves, pleads guilty - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BNB.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nBinance cofounder and CEO Changpeng Zhao speaks during the 2022 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, on Nov. 1, 2022. Ben Mcshane | Sportsfile | Getty Images\n\nOutflows from Binance have amounted to more than $1 billion in the past 24 hours, not including bitcoin, according to data from blockchain analysis firm Nansen, after founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao stepped down and pleaded guilty Tuesday in a deal with the Department of Justice. Meanwhile, liquidity has dropped 25% over the same time frame as market makers pull back their positions, according to data provider Kaiko. The outflows are significant and close to what happened previously when the exchange and its founder were charged with 13 securities violations by the SEC.\n\nThe exchange's native token, BNB, is down more than 8% in the last 24 hours. Binance holds around $2.8 billion worth of BNB tokens, according to Nansen. And in March, after Binance phased out zero-fee trading of crypto asset pairs including bitcoin, a key incentive for customers, the exchange began to see its share of all spot trading drop. Binance remains the world's largest crypto exchange globally, processing billions of dollars in trading volume every year. Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines to the U.S. government. The plea deals end a yearslong investigation into the crypto exchange. Assets of more than $65 billion remain on the platform, according to Nansen, meaning that Binance is likely capitalized enough to withstand a sudden rush of investors away from the platform. And while withdrawals are on the up, there has not yet been a \"mass exodus\" of funds from the exchange. \"After the momentary shock of the agreement with the announcement, there is no significant impact on most assets,\" said Grzegorz Drozdz, a market analyst at investment firm Conotoxia Ltd. \"The cryptocurrency that seems to have suffered the most, losing more than 9%, is the BNB token from Binance. Of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, as many as 98 have seen a noticeable rebound over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, meanwhile, fell 4% before rebounding and remaining with a loss of 1.3%,\" he said. Drozdz added that it may be a net positive for the industry now that the dispute with regulators is behind Binance and that the company has pledged to increase security measures. \"This, combined with the likely imminent approval of an ETF based on bitcoin quotes, could positively impact the crypto market in the long term,\" said Drozdz.\n\nCan Binance survive at this stage?\n\nThat's the multibillion-dollar question the cryptocurrency giant faces after Zhao agreed to a plea deal and stepped down from the company. Started by the Chinese-born entrepreneur in 2017, Binance went from being a relatively obscure name to being a major force in crypto in a matter of weeks. Experts CNBC spoke with said that Binance is likely to make it through the ordeal despite a turbulent situation. They cited the company's decision to comply with the DOJ process and implement a three-year strategy to get its operations into compliance, and the amount of assets held within the company's reserves. \"The sum of $4 billion is clearly very large and will create real pain for Binance's balance sheet,\" Yesha Yadav, Milton R. Underwood professor of law and associate dean at Vanderbilt University, told CNBC via email. \"However, this fine does not appear aimed at dealing a fatal blow to the exchange. Based on Binance's dominant position within the crypto-ecosystem over a number of years, CZ's personal wealth ... and continuing trading volumes despite declines in overall crypto trading volume as well as in Binance's market share relative to other venues, I doubt that Binance will face risks to its solvency in paying this fine.\"\n\n$4.3 billion plea deal\n\nZhao and others were charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating U.S. economic sanctions \"in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the U.S. market without implementing controls required by U.S. law,\" according to the Justice Department. Binance has agreed to forfeit $2.5 billion to the government and to pay a fine of $1.8 billion, for a total of $4.3 billion. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference Tuesday that it's \"one of the largest penalties we have ever obtained.\" \"Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor. It makes you a criminal,\" Garland said. \"Binance prioritized its profits over the safety of the American people.\" Zhao said Tuesday in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that he had \"made mistakes\" and \"must take responsibility.\" Richard Teng, a former Abu Dhabi financial services regulator, was named as Zhao's replacement. Teng was most recently the global head of regional markets at Binance. He was also previously director of corporate finance at the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The action against Binance and its founder was a joint effort by the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury Department. The Securities and Exchange Commission was notably absent. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a release Tuesday that the exchange allowed illicit actors to make more than 100,000 transactions that supported activities such as terrorism and illegal narcotics and that it allowed more than 1.5 million virtual currency trades that violated U.S. sanctions. It also allowed transactions associated with terrorist groups such as Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, al-Qaida and ISIS, Yellen said in the release, noting Binance \"never filed a single suspicious activity report.\" Zhao has been released on a $175 million personal recognizance bond secured by $15 million in cash and has a sentencing hearing scheduled for Feb. 23.\n\nBinance to continue"
