        "content": "Bitcoin's price this week is near a familiar and key support level, but its latest stop there is a little more worrying than previous ones this year, according to Wolfe Research. Earlier this week, bitcoin fell below $25,000 for the first time since March . The flagship cryptocurrency tested this threshold at various points this year, but it always rebounded. While bitcoin has been floating in the narrow range of $25,000 to $30,000 all year, investors have cheered its resilience knowing potential catalysts such as developments around bitcoin exchange-traded funds were on the horizon. That long-term momentum is starting to break, however. That means crypto investors who have been patiently waiting for better days may want to consider their positions. \"With support in this area on dual fronts, it makes sense that price would hold and consolidate in this region. However, as we look around, the crypto landscape is growing ever more concerning,\" Wolfe analyst Rob Ginsberg said in a note Wednesday. \"Coins are taking out crucial levels of support across the board and there's not many bright spots to be found at the moment.\" \"Longer term momentum is starting to break in bitcoin,\" he added. \"This is often one of our more reliable warning signs and part of the reason we are currently bearish on the broader market. Short term price action is never our worry, it's when longer term trends start to break, that we want to take notice and pivot accordingly.\" BTC.CM= 6M mountain Bitcoin recently fell below key support at $25,000 for the first time since March. Bitcoin's 50-day moving average began turning lower in August and recently crossed below its 200-day moving average. Although it may be losing momentum, the 200-day moving average is still ascending. The next level of support below $25,000 is at $20,000, Ginsberg said. Further, ether is testing the $1,600 threshold, which has Wolfe \"highly concerned.\" Failure to bounce from that level puts $1,500 at the next level to test on the downside, the firm said. \"As the retail investor comes under pressure and liquidity is drained, our concerns will only grow for crypto prices,\" Ginsberg added. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom and Nick Wells contributed reporting."

        "content": "Swan Bitcoin is offering new insight into how Bitcoin stored on its exchange will be held in custody in the future, following a tumultuous month in which many of the company's users were left looking for clarity.\n\nAnnounced Thursday, Swan Bitcoin says it intends to partner with BitGo to launch a \"Bitcoin-only trust company,\" one that would require regulatory approval before ultimately being made live for customers.\n\n\"This strategic partnership aims to cater to the growing demand for Bitcoin-specific solutions while addressing the critical security and custody requirements within the Bitcoin ecosystem,\" a press release sent exclusively to Bitcoin Magazine read.\n\nSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said in a statement that the plan is to either acquire an existing trust company, or build one. If they choose to acquire, he said they aim to be live with customers by Q1 2024. If, instead, they build a new trust, the goal is to go live by Q3.\n\nKlippsten further detailed how the move builds on an existing collaboration between the companies, explaining that BitGo has held all of Swan users\u2019 custodied coins in cold storage since June, which will continue. He claims Fortress does not custody Swan clients\u2019 coins except for small amounts temporarily when satisfying withdrawal requests.\n\nBitGo CEO Mike Belshe echoed Klippsten's claims, saying the companies have been collaborating on a solution for some time. Prior to Fortress and BitGo, Swan Bitcoin used Prime Trust as its preferred custody partner.\n\nPrime Trust filed for bankruptcy in August, claiming a shortfall of customer funds.\n\n\"Our teams have worked closely together for nearly a year on stronger qualified custody models,\" Belshe said. \"Early in 2023, we recognized the opportunity to establish a Bitcoin-only custodian, combining the capabilities of each company.\"\n\nThe trust's announcement follows the acquisition of Fortress by Ripple, a cryptocurrency company formed in 2012 that is devoted to evangelizing the XRP digital asset. The acquisition of Fortress by Ripple caused a stir on social media, especially given that Klippsten has previously accused Ripple of fraud.\n\nOf note is that Swan Bitcoin actively discourages customers from holding Bitcoin on its exchange, an industry best practice that has limited client exposure to Fortress.\n\nElsewhere, the press release was forward-looking and aspirational, with Klippsten seeking to highlight his desire to create a Bitcoin-only custodian that would satisfy his customer's concerns, limiting their exposure to the cryptocurrency ecosystem of which he has been so publicly critical.\n\nFounded in 2013, BitGo is a leading cryptocurrency custody company regarded for its security, though it's notable that, after launching as a Bitcoin-only company, it would go on to add support for hundreds of crypto assets.\n\nStill, the prospect of the creation of a Bitcoin-only custodian will likely find an appeal with Swan Bitcoin's users, while Klippsten said they expect to serve company treasuries, asset managers, governments and on-ramps like Swan itself. Though in practice it remains to be seen whether there would be demand for the offering.\n\n\u201cWith the Bitcoin-specific trust company, we'll finally be able to deliver the product that marries the best of self-custody service with the components that require qualified custody. This has never been achievable before, because existing offerings focus on breadth of token support rather than the absolute best custody for Bitcoin,\" said Swan Bitcoin cofounder and CTO Yan Pritzker. \"The new trust company will offer Bitcoin-specific features such as institution-grade advanced wallet management capabilities and more ways for clients to hold their own keys, inheritance planning, and adoption of new Bitcoin standards as they emerge.\"\n\nFor instance, some of Swan's competitors in the Bitcoin-only brokerage space, such as River, already employ their own in-house custody solutions without third parties.\n\n\"For years we\u2019ve heard from major clients, partners, and other Bitcoin companies that they would prefer a Bitcoin-only software and services stack, focused on strictly the best custody leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s unique features,\" said Klippsten. \"Time has proven that altcoins come with risks on many levels. Demand will continue to grow for Bitcoin-only services that avoid many of those risks.\"\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
