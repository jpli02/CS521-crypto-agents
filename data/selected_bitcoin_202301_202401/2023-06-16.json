        "content": "Bitcoin still closed the week slightly negative, for the second week in a row, by 0.21%. Ether also posted a second consecutive weekly decline. It fell 10.84%. Coin Metrics measures a week in crypto, which trades 24 hours a day, from the 4:00 p.m. ET stock market close one Friday to the next.\n\nEven altcoins rose, with the tokens tied to Solana and Cardano gaining 4.5% and 2%, respectively. Binance Coin was 2.75% higher, litecoin gained 3% and the Uniswap token advanced 4%.\n\nCrypto prices climbed to end the week Friday, a day after the largest asset manager in the world jumped into the race to launch the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S.\n\nInvestors were weighing the latest development in the crypto industry's battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for regulatory recognition and guidance. After the bell Thursday, BlackRock \u2014 the largest asset manager in the world \u2014 filed for spot bitcoin ETF, with Coinbase as its crypto custodian.\n\n\"One of the big purposes bitcoin serves as an asset class is really diversification. It just has a different risk profile than traditional financial markets,\" Gustavo Schwenkler, associate professor at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University said. \"If this were to get approved, then I could anticipate a lot more institutional investors adding bitcoin to their investment to their portfolios \u2026 it would institutionalize the market in a way that is not possible right now.\"\n\nIf allowed to move forward, the iShares Bitcoin Trust would become the first approved ETF in the U.S. to track the price of bitcoin, versus the futures contracts tied to the cryptocurrency. It's been about 10 years since the first filing for a potential spot bitcoin ETF. Since then, every application that has gone through the SEC has been rejected.\n\nThe filing comes about a week after the SEC sued its crypto custody partner, Coinbase, for violating securities laws, leaving many questioning the timing of BlackRock's application.\n\n\"That apparent commitment to Coinbase is almost as important near term as their commitment to bitcoin is in the long term,\" said Mark Connors, head of research at 3iQ. \"It's a big deal.\"\n\n\u2014CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed reporting."

        "title": "Bitcoin as a Hedge for Inflation \u2013 Is It Still a Good Option? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The financial landscape continues to be redefined by the advent of digital currencies, despite the skepticism of some investors. Among these new-age assets, Bitcoin \u2013 the world's leading cryptocurrency \u2013 emerges as an intriguing option for those seeking an inflation hedge.\n\nBitcoin's design, characterized by its fixed supply of 21 million coins, safeguards it from the inflationary pressures that traditional currencies succumb to. By nature, Bitcoin cannot undergo dilution through inflation - a compelling factor that makes it enticing to discerning investors. Moreover, the decentralized architecture of Bitcoin disentangles it from any form of manipulation or control by central banks and governments. This intrinsic freedom lends an additional layer of security to investors wary of government interventions.\n\nHowever, the unique design of Bitcoin doesn't guarantee its viability as an inflation hedge in every circumstance. It's crucial to note that the value of Bitcoin is primarily driven by market demand and supply, with no tangible asset backing it up. Thus, the price can be volatile, experiencing dramatic rises and falls over short periods, even more so than traditional investments. For example, between late 2017 and early 2018, Bitcoin's price swung from nearly $20,000 down to just above $3,000. This level of volatility poses a risk for investors who may need to liquidate their holdings in times of market stress.\n\nWhen using Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, one must also consider its relatively short history compared to traditional investment vehicles like gold. With just over a decade in existence, Bitcoin's performance in a diverse range of economic scenarios is not entirely known. Its behavior during inflationary periods, in particular, remains largely untested. Given that inflation tends to occur over long timeframes, Bitcoin's longevity and stability in such conditions are yet to be fully evaluated.\n\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is another critical factor in assessing Bitcoin's feasibility as an inflation hedge. Despite gaining wider acceptance, cryptocurrencies are still subjected to legal and regulatory uncertainties across different jurisdictions. There have been instances where governments, including China and India, have restricted or banned the use of cryptocurrencies, impacting their value and liquidity.\n\nThese factors do not undermine Bitcoin's potential but reflect the complexities and risks that come with investing in it. When considering Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, it is advisable to incorporate it as part of a diversified portfolio. By spreading investments across a range of asset types, investors can leverage Bitcoin's potential benefits while mitigating its risks.\n\nFurthermore, it's essential to keep in mind that hedging against inflation is a long-term strategy. Therefore, patience and discipline are key. Although Bitcoin's price may experience dramatic fluctuations in the short term, its overall trajectory since inception suggests a positive trend. Yet, investing in Bitcoin should not be based solely on historical performance, but rather, on thorough research and understanding of the asset and the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin has potential as an inflation hedge due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. However, the inherent volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and relatively short historical record compared to traditional hedges add a level of risk. Thus, a careful, well-researched approach and diversification are crucial when considering Bitcoin as part of an inflation-hedging strategy.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. and Nasdaq\u00ae is a registered trademark of Nasdaq, Inc.
