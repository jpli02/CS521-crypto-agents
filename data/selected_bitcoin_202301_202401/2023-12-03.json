        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nYuichiro Chino | Moment | Getty Images\n\nExecutives in the cryptocurrency industry called the start of a new bull run with a growing number of voices calling for fresh all-time highs for bitcoin in 2024 above $100,000. Bitcoin has rallied more than 120% this year, with many optimistic about the surge continuing into 2024. \"It feels that [2023]was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. But the sentiment is very hopeful for [2024] and 25,\" Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, told CNBC last week in an interview.\n\nThe digital currency's last record high of nearly $69,000 was hit in November 2021. Since then, the crypto industry has been hit with a litany of issues from the collapse of coins and projects to bankruptcies and criminal trials. FTX, once one of the world's biggest exchanges, collapsed with its founder Sam Bankman-Fried facing over 100 years in prison after he was found guilty on seven counts of criminal fraud. Meanwhile, Binance chief Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as the company's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Many in the industry see the two cases concluding as a line being drawn under issues that have plagued the crypto market. \"I think that once you get the speculative phase out of the way, which I think we're almost done with, probably not yet completely done, then you can get real builders focusing on the technology and the problems that can solve in the world, rather than just having a giant digital casino for people to trade,\" David Marcus, CEO of Lightspark, told CNBC last week in an interview. Marcus, the former leader of Facebook's failed Diem stablecoin project, is now working on technology to improve bitcoin as a payments network.\n\nwatch now\n\nNow that those issues are out the way, investors are focused on what the industry sees as positive developments. The first is the growing excitement that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF, might be approved soon. This could bring in larger traditional investors who previously did not want to touch crypto. \"I think what the ETF means really is that bitcoin is going mainstream, and that's what people were waiting for,\" Gauthier said. The second development is the bitcoin halving, which takes place every four years and is scheduled for May 2024. Halving is when miners, which are entities who uphold the bitcoin network, see the rewards for their work cut in half. This keeps a cap on the supply of bitcoin \u2014 of which there will ever only be 21 million coins \u2014 and often is a factor behind a new rally. \"A number of market participants are expecting a bull run some time after the halving, but given the ETF news, we could very well have a run before that leaving most investors on the sidelines. That could cause a massive upward run in the price,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international markets at cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX, told CNBC.\n\nBitcoin at $100,000?\n\nThere have already been some bold calls for bitcoin in 2024. It began with Standard Chartered last week which reiterated an April price call that bitcoin would hit $100,000 by end of 2024. The bank said this will be driven by the approvals of numerous ETFs. That would mean a roughly 160% rally from Friday's price of around $38,413, according to CoinDesk data. Matrixport, which bills itself as a crypto financial services firm, released a note last week projecting bitcoin would reach $63,140 by April 2024 and $125,000 by the end of next year. \"Based on our inflation model, the macro environment is expected to remain a robust tailwind for crypto. Another decline in inflation is anticipated, prompting the Federal Reserve to likely initiate interest rate cuts,\" Matrixport said in its report. \"Combined with geopolitical crosscurrents, this healthy dose of monetary support should push Bitcoin to new highs in 2024.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nMany commentators see easing monetary policy as supportive for bitcoin which is viewed as a risky asset. Meanwhile, some see bitcoin as a sort of \"safe haven\" asset to pour money into in times of geopolitical strife. When asked if bitcoin would hit $100,000 in 2024, Gauthier said \"maybe,\" but declined to give a price prediction. \"What we see is strong fundamentals,\" he said. Ayyar said that the price of bitcoin is \"consolidating\" below a \"key level\" of $38,000, which is bullish for bitcoin. Once this level is broke, bitcoin could rally to between $45,000 and $48,000 next, he said. However, he warned the rally, which is in large part built on expectations of an ETF approval, could fail if the product is rejected by regulators again. \"An all out ETF rejection could play havoc to this run as well, hence definitely something to be mindful of,\" he said.\n\nwatch now"

        "title": "3 Cryptos to Buy Before the Bitcoin ETF Goes Live - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The recent spike in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC-USD) price above $38,000 has brought a fresh wave of crypto investors into the market. With the long-awaited Bitcoin ETF potentially going live in 2024, renewed optimism avails for a bull run.\n\nHowever, it goes far beyond the ETF. Bitcoin has major catalysts approaching, like the mining reward halving projected for mid-2024. This event occurs every few years, cutting the rewards that miners receive by half and significantly impacting supply and demand dynamics over the long run. Considering mining rewards are the only new bitcoins entering circulation, halvings tend to precede major bull runs.\n\nAlso, macroeconomic factors align to Bitcoin\u2019s favor. Interest rates are still painfully high but will likely decline in 2024 or early 2025. Lower rates combined with the ETF and halving could create a perfect storm for crypto.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLess risky crypto projects for newcomers are important for long-term staying power. Let\u2019s delve into three bigger cryptos that could perform well in the next bull market, especially if a Bitcoin ETF gets approved soon.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nBitcoin cryptocurrency with pile of coins, Vector illustrator\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nBitcoin is the obvious top pick for any crypto portfolio right now. Since it has several major catalysts lining up in 2023 and 2024, it could kickstart the next major bull run. As digital gold, BTC has a built-in scarcity and capped supply that no other crypto can match. Specifically, only 21 million BTC will be in existence.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin has downsides too. The network is rather slow and inefficient for payments compared to newer cryptos. Transactions can take over an hour to process, and fees are high due to congestion issues.\n\nWhen adding crypto exposure or balancing a portfolio with some uncorrelated assets, Bitcoin should be the first token of choice right now. Unless something catastrophic happens to destroy trust in crypto entirely, Bitcoin has likely seen its final bear market bottom around $15,000-$17,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the macro backdrop improving in 2024, a crashing of Bitcoin seems unlikely. As noted in June 2022, Bitcoin was not expected to break below $15,000, even in a worst-case scenario. Indeed, it bottomed around that level. Further, $25,000 might possibly be the new floor once the ETF goes live.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nEtereum coin is in pocket. Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. ETH crypto\n\nSource: Thaninee Chuensomchit / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Ethereum (ETH-USD) differs from Bitcoin, it\u2019s been an exceptional long-term investment nonetheless.\n\nAs the second largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum dominates the smart contracts and Web 3.0 spaces. It allows decentralized apps and services to run on its network via the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities are quite limited to maximize security. It only supports peer-to-peer payments out of the box.\n\nAlready, ETH supply has turned deflationary post-Merge. More ETH is now removed from circulation via network burns than issued as staking rewards. Supply is decreasing by 1.75% annually, far below the Bitcoin inflation rate.\n\nOf course, Ethereum lacks Bitcoin\u2019s hard cap on supply, which some investors see as a drawback. So, while unlimited supply may seem concerning theoretically, network activity and burn dynamics act as a \u201csoft cap,\u201d keeping inflation below Bitcoin\u2019s. Also, an unlimited supply future-proofs Ethereum, ensuring that stakers still receive adequate future rewards, long after further supply decreases.\n\nFinally, Ethereum stands to gain from accelerating Web 3.0 and crypto adoption. While Bitcoin operates as a relatively simple payment network, Ethereum is an entire ecosystem for decentralized computing. Notably, Ethereum\u2019s correlation to Bitcoin remains high. ETH initially massively outperformed BTC but has lagged recently as the crypto focus returned to being a hedge against inflation.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin sees another parabolic bull run in 2024-2025 off the halving, ETF approval, and macro backdrop, Ethereum is likely to benefit, too. Similar to the 2017-2018 bull market, while BTC may rise faster early, ETH can often overtake its gains in the later speculative frenzy stages.\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD)\n\nImage of one litecoin in front of many stacks of litecoins. Litecoin price predictions\n\nSource: Wit Olszewski / Shutterstock.com\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD) can be seen as a smaller sibling to Bitcoin with higher risk and higher reward potential. One of the oldest and most established crypto projects, Litecoin is essentially a faster Bitcoin fork with lower fees and a few tweaks. It operates similarly, capped at 84 million LTC instead of 21 million BTC. The vast majority of its code is identical.\n\nThus, Litecoin\u2019s correlation to Bitcoin price action tends to be very high. However, LTC generally amplifies BTC moves in both directions. When Bitcoin rises or crashes, Litecoin usually does so even more dramatically as happened in 2013, 2017, and the recent 2022-2023 crash. With its smaller $5.3 billion market cap, LTC remains more volatile and speculative than the blue chip-like BTC.\n\nSo, if Bitcoin indeed kicks off a new bull market in 2024, Litecoin seems poised to massively outperform it. Plus, it could be a safer, smaller-cap play than 99% of altcoins. Although the use case remains questionable, the correlation and historical precedent remain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
