        "content": "Today, Bitcoin exchange River has unveiled its latest product, River Link, aiming to transform the way Bitcoin is sent and received on a global scale. River Link facilitates the seamless transfer of Bitcoin through text messages, offering users a straightforward and user-friendly experience that eliminates the complexities often associated with Bitcoin transactions.\n\nTraditionally, sending Bitcoin to new users involves the creation and exchange of a public address, a process that can be cumbersome for non-technical users. River Link seeks to overcome these challenges by leveraging the widespread use of messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, as well as social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. With River Link, users can now send Bitcoin effortlessly to anyone, anywhere in the world, regardless of their technical understanding.\n\n\"River Link aims to build on the incredible rails that Bitcoin offers by allowing you to send Bitcoin to anyone over a text message, email, or direct message,\" said River CEO Alex Leishman. \u201cWe reimagined the Bitcoin transaction experience \u2014 embracing the simplicity of a user-centric app with Bitcoin\u2019s ethos of an open network.\u201d This flexibility ensures that recipients can claim their Bitcoin securely and conveniently, regardless of their jurisdiction or technical know-how.\n\nRiver envisions River Link as a significant step toward realizing its goal of positioning Bitcoin as the premier medium of exchange worldwide. \u201cThe traditional Bitcoin transaction experience is clunky. Other companies have attempted to solve this with siloed features that require both parties to use the same app,\u201d says Leishman. \u201cThis improves the transaction experience, but restricts user choice and dictates where people need to hold their Bitcoin.\u201d By providing a user-friendly and accessible platform for Bitcoin transactions, River aims to bring the benefits of Bitcoin to a broader audience, making it easier for individuals to engage in transactions.\n\nAddressing the common challenges associated with Bitcoin transactions, River's Chief Operating Officer, Julia Duzon, notes that River Link simplifies the multi-step process of paying or gifting Bitcoin. Duzon emphasizes the practical applications of River Link, stating, \"There is now an easier way to give your friend a birthday gift, pay a co-worker for lunch, or simply get your family into Bitcoin. With River Link, Bitcoin is another step closer to our vision of being the best medium of exchange in the world.\"\n\n\u201cSimply enter the amount of the River Link, text it to your friend, and they can claim the Bitcoin to any wallet,\u201d says Duzon. \u201cThis experience is truly frictionless, interoperable, and open \u2014 the way Bitcoin was always intended to be.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Over the past six months, talks of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become increasingly prominent. With over a dozen applications filed from asset management companies such as BlackRock Inc. and Grayscale, the proposed ETFs are inching closer and closer to reality.\n\nWith talks becoming more serious, the price of Bitcoin has also been doing well. Bitcoin is approaching $40,000 for the first time since April 2022, and the hype around the token and ETFs is real.\n\nWhile there are already a handful of Bitcoin ETFs on the market, they use futures to track the price of Bitcoin. This results in high fees, as the manager has to continually roll over the contracts, and it means the ETF may not always track exactly with Bitcoin. The proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs attempt to solve these issues by owning Bitcoins and creating an ETF on that basis. While this may seem like a simple and demanded solution, there are some steep regulatory hurdles that the applicants must overcome.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAnalysts predict Bitcoin ETF approval by Jan. 10th. Prepare your BTC stack today .\n\nThis brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it ?\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\n\nDespite these challenges, firms are continuing to meet with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and JPMorgan predicts that some spot Bitcoin ETFs could go live as soon as early 2024. Because of this, many are beginning to look at the implications of a spot Bitcoin ETF on crypto.\n\neToro CEO Yoni Assia is one of those who wonders what a market with spot Bitcoin ETFs would look like.\n\nAssia pointed out that the ETFs have the potential to lead to large-scale adoption on an institutional level for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, he believes that many institutions \"work in a very rigid way.\" Because of this, they can be hesitant to invest in assets that they are not familiar with or are not readily available. \"[An] ETF, in many cases, is that infrastructure to enable institutional demand to those who don't want to self-custody,\" Assia said.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, Assia believes that the increased availability of Bitcoin would lead to more trust on an institutional level. Without the ETF, investors must go to a crypto exchange, use a wallet and navigate a new way of investing. With the ETF, it becomes more accessible and could result in new investors and price increases.\n\nAssia also alluded to the impacts spot Bitcoin ETFs could have on retail investors. In his eyes, retail investing is \"all about the user experience, simplicity and the ability to embed crypto investments and crypto trading in a wider portfolio.\" These ETFs would make it easier for retail investors to incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolios and increase access.\n\nAssia, along with many others, sees spot Bitcoin ETFs as a net good for crypto. They believe that this could be a major step in the wide-scale adoption of the token.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nThis article Here's What eToro's CEO Says About Bitcoin ETFs originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.
