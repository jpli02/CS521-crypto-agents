        "content": "Bitcoin dropped below $29,000 for the first time in over a month as the recent exorbitance over ETFs and a more favorable regulatory outlook eases.\n\nThe largest digital-asset by market value fell as much as 4.2% to $28,865, the least since June 21. Bitcoin is up around 75% this year. Most other tokens were also lower on Monday, with recent high-flyer XRP down about 7% and Solana off 8%."

        "content": "Long-term bitcoin (BTC) holders, or addresses that hold coins for at least 155 days, now control a record three-fourths of the cryptocurrency's circulating supply.\n\nData tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode show the balance held in these wallets has increased by 62,882 BTC ($1.83 billion) to a record 14.52 million BTC this month, surpassing the previous peak of 14.48 million BTC registered on May 21.\n\nThe new high means holders own 75% of the circulating supply of 19.437 million BTC.\n\nCirculating supply refers to the total number of coins that are actively available for trade in the market.\n\n\"This suggests HODLing is the preferred market dynamic amongst mature investors,\" Glassnode tweeted.\n\nThe rate of flow into wallets controlled by illiquid entities, or network participants with little-to-no spending history, also remains strong, suggesting continued accumulation and weakening of sell-side pressures in the market. The number of coins held by these illiquid entities has surged by over 90,000 BTC this month.\n\nDisclaimer: This article was written and edited by CoinDesk journalists with the sole purpose of informing the reader with accurate information.

        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nThe reason behind the sharpness in the drop is unclear, although the move coincided with a Wall Street Journal report augmenting recent anxiety from investors around Binance. Specifically, CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao reportedly suggested in private conversation in 2019 that Binance affiliates had accounted for a portion of trading volume around the time it launched its U.S. trading arm. There are questions about whether this activity constituted \"wash trading\" aimed at inflating volume.\n\nBitcoin was last lower by more than 3% at $29,121.60, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it sank as low as $28,995.02, its lowest level in more than a month.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell sharply and suddenly to start the week as investors awaited a major Federal Reserve policy decision and digested concerns around Binance.\n\nBinance is the largest crypto exchange in the world. It was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission last month and is at the center of a Department of Justice investigation that's likely to end with a consent decree or settlement, CNBC previously reported. Federal prosecutors have been weighing anti-money laundering violations and sanctions evasion charges, allegations that would make it difficult for Binance or founder Zhao to continue to get licenses to operate.\n\nNot everyone is convinced the big move could be put on the Binance story, however.\n\n\"You could probably chalk it up to technicals or flows,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investing firm eToro. \"$30,000 is a big deal, and it makes sense that bitcoin investors are feeling more nervous around these levels. Recoveries aren't always a straight line up.\"\n\nElsewhere, investors are also watching what the Federal Reserve does at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"Bitcoin is still fluctuating within a narrow range for a little more than a week, and it will likely continue to do so until the conclusion of this week's FOMC meeting,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank. \"The market has almost fully priced in another 25 basis point rate hike by the Fed this week and is paying close attention to whether they are going to carry out another by the end of this year as FOMC's previous economic outlook suggested.\"\n\nRate increases helped pull bitcoin's price lower throughout 2022, which was already filled with several negative catalysts for the industry. Despite the recent resilience in bitcoin and rally in equities, recession concerns remain as traders weigh the lagged effect of rate hikes and recent signals of slowing in the economy.\n\n\"We have yet to see June's personal consumption expenditure \u2026 and they will not likely hasten to make the decision to halt rate hikes until they have more data and are more confident that inflation is coming down,\" Hasegawa added. \"This means that FOMC's rate decisions henceforth will likely continue to be 'live,' and bitcoin may not successfully break out of $31,500 for another while.\"\n\n\u2014CNBC's Rohan Goswami contributed reporting."
