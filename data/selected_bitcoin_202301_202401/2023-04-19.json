        "content": "Bitcoin dropped back below the closely watched $30,000 level amid a wider retreat in cryptocurrencies , as stubbornly high UK inflation fanned fears of higher-for-longer interest rates.\n\nThe largest digital token fell as much as 4.5% before paring some of the slide to trade at about $29,276 as of 3:05 p.m. in New York on Wednesday. Bitcoin has traded on either side of the benchmark number after reaching that level last week for the first time since June."

        "content": "Bitcoin Stamps seek to offer greater permanence and security on the blockchain, attracting collectors and creators.\n\nBitcoin Stamps are the latest innovation in the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), offering collectors and creators a secure and reliable means of storing unique digital assets on bitcoin, like Ordinals. According to creator Mike In Space, stamps guarantee greater permanence than other protocols as they are stored directly in the spendable transaction outputs of the blockchain, making them impossible to prune.\n\nIn just 32 days since the launch of the first Stamp, 16,500 Stamps had been created on the Bitcoin blockchain, outpacing the daily growth of assets created compared to Ordinals.\n\nThe Rare Stamp platform, launched on April 6, 2023, indexes all Stamp data such as prices, last sales and other relevant data. The platform has witnessed the growing interest in Bitcoin NFTs and the rapid expansion of Stamps, receiving over 20,000 visits from users interested in discovering, buying and selling Stamps according to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n\n\n\"We are excited to bring visibility to this innovation that allows for the creation of virtually eternal NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The rapid adoption of Stamps shows the growing interest in NFTs and the demand for more permanent and secure solutions,\" said Angel Haro, CMO of Universelle, the Spanish consulting firm that developed the Rare Stamp platform.\n\nBitcoin Stamps seeks to offer a secure and reliable means of storing unique digital assets on the blockchain, according to the press release. With the growing interest in Bitcoin-based digital assets and the demand for more permanent and secure solutions, the Rare Stamp platform aims to provide detailed information on sale prices, new collections and other unique features.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin and ether fall as investors weigh persistent inflation and rising interest rates - CNBC",
        "content": "\"We believe the pullback we're seeing is more a function of an overdue correction following some impressive moves and possible profit taking on broader risk-off flow in global markets than anything crypto specific,\" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group.\n\nThe drop comes after ether rallied 12% over the course of last week and pushed above the $2,000 for the first time since August. That helped drive bitcoin higher by 8% to above the $30,000 mark.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was last lower by 3.22% and trading at $29,227.24, while ether fell 4.82% to $1,980.68, according to Coin Metrics.\n\nBitcoin slid toward $29,000 on Wednesday as traders mulled over the likelihood that Federal Reserve rate cuts may be further away than they thought.\n\nInvestors Wednesday morning were taking in new U.K. inflation data, which showed consumer prices unexpectedly held above 10% in March. That fueled expectations that the Bank of England could hike rates by 25 basis points at its May meeting.\n\nMeanwhile in the U.S., Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Tuesday that he anticipates one more 25 basis point interest rate increase and then a hold \"for quite some time.\" Bostic spoke to CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"\n\n\"There have been some signs the Fed could be more aggressive towards higher interest rate policy than what the market is pricing, which has been driving yield differentials in the U.S. dollar's favor, while weighing on sentiment,\" Kruger said.\n\nMarket participants had expected a pullback in crypto prices this week as investors moved attention away from Ethereum's latest technical upgrade and toward the potential that the Fed could push the economy into a recession with its rate hikes \u2014 which would give bitcoin a new proving ground at a time when investors are just warming to the diversity of the crypto asset's potential.\n\nClara Medalie, head of research at crypto data provider Kaiko, noted that liquidity in the crypto market remains low after the U.S. lost two of its biggest fiat-to-crypto on-ramps in the banking crisis earlier this year \u2013 the networks provided by Silvergate and Signature Bank.\n\n\"Overall, volatility can be expected both towards the upside and downside due to a prolonged bout of thin liquidity in crypto markets, which has hit bitcoin and ether particularly hard,\" she said. \"It is hard to trust any crypto rally with the state of market liquidity, so a sharp drop towards the downside is hardly a surprise.\"\n\nTraders were also digesting Tuesday's contentious congressional hearing with Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who defended his agency's crackdown on cryptocurrency trading platforms and failed to provide a clear answer on whether ether is a security. Gensler has long maintained that all crypto assets other than bitcoin should be deemed securities."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nCrypto derivatives exchange Deribit is launching free trading of bitcoin and other tokens, setting up a fresh price war among digital asset exchanges as they seek to re-emerge after a bruising year for the industry.\n\nThe Panama-based group, the world\u2019s biggest crypto options exchange, will begin direct trading in three of the most popular cryptocurrency pairs from next week and waive the fees.\n\nIts move underscores how competition is heating up among crypto exchanges as they try to entice institutional investors keen to get into a rising market after the crash in digital asset prices last year and the failure of industry bellwether FTX. Around 90 per cent of Deribit\u2019s customers are institutional clients.\n\nPopular coins such as bitcoin and ether have outperformed assets such as stocks and commodities this year, rising 50 per cent and 65 per cent respectively.\n\nIt also comes a month after Binance, the world\u2019s largest marketplace for crypto trading, ended a six-month foray into zero-fee trading, a move that accelerated its market share.\n\nLuuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, said the exchange\u2019s move into spot trading was driven by customer demand.\n\n\u201cYou would have to buy ether on Binance instead of Deribit,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIf you want to convert $5mn [into bitcoin], for example, we would have to tell you to go elsewhere, which is terrible customer service.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to have a proper derivatives offering you also need to have spot,\u201d he added.\n\nBig-name money managers have continued to explore digital assets and monetise investor interest in the past year, even as the industry suffered a confidence crisis and many companies failed.\n\n\u201cSerious institutional players remain committed and, in fact, see the open space after the demise of multiple crypto-native players as an opportunity.\u201d Bernstein analysts wrote this week.\n\nDeribit will offer free trading in pairs of ether and bitcoin, and ether and bitcoin against the stablecoin USDC, which is operated by Circle. US-listed Coinbase charges up to 0.6 per cent for a trade, for example.\n\nStrijers added that trading on the three pairs would remain free to trade \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d and that future tokens that might be added would have a charge.\n\nThe market share of Binance soared by a fifth after launching fee-free trading in 13 coins and at reached nearly two-thirds of total volume on the exchange, according to data provider Kaiko. However the exchange\u2019s lead fell back after it reintroduced charges.\n\nDeribit added that it was looking to use spot trading as an entry for customers to trade options and futures. Strijers said this would \u201cservice our existing client base and potentially attract some new clients who then . . . will also trade options, futures or perpetual [futures]\u201d.\n\nDeribit was founded in 2016 and is backed by investors including crypto venture firm 10T Holdings and trading firm Akuna Capital."
