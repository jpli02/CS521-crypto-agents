Earlier, it fell as far down as $40,601.37, its lowest level since Dec. 18. Ether , which has gotten a boost in recent days while bitcoin struggled, fell too. It was last down 3% at $2,448.41. The rest of the crypto market broadly dragged with them.\n\nThe move in bitcoin weighed on crypto-related stocks, too. Coinbase and MicroStrategy ended the trading day down 7% and 2%, respectively. Miners CleanSpark and Marathon Digital lost more than 6% each, while Riot Platforms fell 5% and Iris Energy retreated 8%.\n\n\"We are still in the correction post-ETF launch,\" said Julio Moreno, head of research at crypto data provider CryptoQuant.\n\n\"Short-term traders and large bitcoin holders are still doing significant selling in a context of a risk-off attitude,\" he added. \"Additionally, unrealized profit margins have not fallen enough for sellers to be exhausted.\""

        "title": "If spot bitcoin ETFs are so great, why's the bitcoin price down? - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nFollowing their approval by the US securities regulators a week ago, about $3bn gross has flowed into spot bitcoin ETFs and bitcoin\u2019s spot price is down 9 per cent. Bitcoin\u2019s slide is inconvenient for crypto promoters who said spot ETFs would be crypto\u2019s watershed moment, though they have plenty of tradfi-proven excuses: profit taking, better to travel than arrive, buy the rumour sell the news, etc.\n\nA neater explanation involves Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a publicly listed bitcoin warehouse that led the lobbying for US spot ETFs to be legalised. GBTC had since 2017 been operating a bitcoin lobster pot: anyone with bitcoins could give them to Grayscale Investments in exchange for OTC-traded shares in the trust, but there was no way to get the bitcoins back.\n\nGBTC last week converted to an ETF, giving its backers their first opportunity to reclaim the $28bn or thereabouts of bitcoin it had collected. And in the four days following spot ETF approval GBTC redemptions have totalled more than $1.6bn.\n\nIt\u2019s been industry practice to assume all the coins previously trapped in GBTC are being reallocated to cheaper ETFs, meaning at-launch net inflow falls to $1.4bn-ish \u2014 but fund reallocation shouldn\u2019t move the bitcoin price; there\u2019s no net selling pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible, however, that some GBTC shareholders just want to cash out. And though it\u2019s silly to draw conclusions from only four days of data, it\u2019s interesting that GBTC redemptions on Tuesday exceeded total inflows for all the other US spot ETFs.\n\nHere\u2019s a chart from JPMorgan, whose analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou expects an overhang from previously trapped GBTC punters to remain for a while yet:\n\nIt looks like GBTC investors who over the past year had been buying the GBTC fund at a significant discount to NAV to position for its eventual ETF conversion, have been taking full profit post ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs. We had previously estimated that up to $3bn had been invested into GBTC in the secondary market during 2023 in order to take advantage of the discount to NAV. If the previous $3bn estimate proves correct and given $1.5bn has exited already then there could be an additional $1.5bn still to exit the bitcoin space via profit taking on GBTC, thus putting further pressure on bitcoin prices over the coming weeks. Whatever the motive behind the past few days $1.5bn of outflows from GBTC, these outflows are exerting pressure on GBTC to lower its fees. The GBTC fee at 1.5% still looks too high compared to other spot bitcoin ETFs risking further outflows even if for some institutional investors fees are not the only reason to consider when deciding whether to shift to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs. Liquidity and market depth also matter but again there is risk for GBTC on that front also if other spot bitcoin ETFs manage to reach critical mass in terms of size and liquidity. A lot more capital, perhaps an additional $5bn-$10bn, could exit GBTC if it loses its liquidity advantage.\n\nOther places to look for rotation are among futures-based bitcoin ETFs, which have bled out by about $300mn since last Thursday, and from exchange accounts. Panigirtzoglou highlights that since spot ETFs were legalised, on-chain cumulative bitcoin flow by smaller digital wallets \u2014 an imperfect proxy for retail punting \u2014 has ticked a tiny bit lower.\n\nJPMorgan says that if retail brokers and exchanges aren\u2019t quick enough cut fees then approximately $36bn ex GBCT could rotate into spot bitcoin ETFs. Its base case however is that exchanges will retaliate, the price war escalates, and spot BTC ETFs inflows fall short of the highest expectations.\n\nWhichever way, for bitcoin\u2019s price, it\u2019s all a nil-sum game at best.\n\nFurther reading\n\n\u2014 Talk to your kids about their spot bitcoin ETF use (FTAV)\n\n\u2014 Imaginary bitcoin ETFs are already 30 times more valuable than all the actual bitcoin ETFs (FTAV)"
