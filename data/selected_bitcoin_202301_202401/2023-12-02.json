        "content": "Former Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jamie Coutts says one metric shows a key difference between Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) bearish phases in 2018 and 2022.\n\nCoutts says that the number of BTC accumulation addresses soared in the 2022 bear market, while they decreased in the 2018 BTC market slump.\n\nAccording to Coutts, the increase in accumulation addresses indicates a stronger belief in the future of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cOne of these Bitcoin bear markets is not like the other.\n\nAccumulation addresses (bought twice and never sold):\n\n2018: -20%\n\n2022: +60%\n\nConviction.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $38,825 at time of writing, up 2.8% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAnother big difference in the crypto space over the past several years, says Coutts, is that there was a massive increase in daily active users (DAUs), which is the number of unique addresses transacting on a blockchain each day.\n\n\u201cCrypto daily active users in layer-1s/layer-2s:\n\n2019: 200,000\n\n2023: 5,000,000\n\nFour-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate): 123%.\n\nLet\u2019s see where this goes.\u201d\n\nCoutts predicts that artificial intelligence (AI) technology will accelerate crypto adoption and help DAU soar to nearly 400 million in 2030.\n\n\u201cSeveral key drivers are coalescing behind the re-acceleration of blockchain adoption as the technology steadily embeds itself into the fabric of our digital era.

        "title": "Breaking down the bullish and bearish cases for Bitcoin in 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "In anticipation of a potential bull market, investors often become engrossed in a narrative, sometimes overlooking the importance of considering alternative scenarios.\n\nThe 90% chance of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in January, according to Bloomberg analysts, and the halving event have been major points of discussion within the crypto community. However, short-term pullback and a price correction of BTC are also possible scenarios to consider.\n\nBullish case\n\nBTC has \u201cleft behind depression and disbelief to enter the next stage: Hope,\u201d the second stage of the halving cycle according to renowned crypto investor CryptoCon.\n\n\u201cAfter a long period of despair, [BTC] price starts to show some signs of making a turnaround,\u201d he added on X.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s protocol reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half approximately every four years, an event known as \u201chalving.\u201d This reduction in new supply tends to create upward pressure on the price as the rate of new Bitcoin entering the market slows down.\n\nFollowing a halving, the reduced supply often leads to a bull market characterized by rising prices and increased investor interest.\n\nHalving Cycles Theory Sine Waves. Source: CryptoCon\n\nInvestors are currently in the \u2018Hope\u2019 phase of the cycle, according to the analyst. This means that people are starting to believe in Bitcoin again after long despair, and the price of Bitcoin has started to show signs of recovery, and it is now trading at fair value, he highlights. The next phase of the cycle is \u2018Belief\u2019.\n\nThis is when investors will start believing in Bitcoin, and the price will rise rapidly. This phase is expected to begin in June 2024 and last for about two years. The final phase of the cycle is \u2018Red Year\u2019, when the price of Bitcoin will reach its all-time high and then crash. This phase is expected to start in June 2026 and last for about one year, according to the expert.\n\nBearish case\n\nThe halving event has historically triggered a correction in Bitcoin\u2019s price before rallying, highlights a crypto analyst AlanSantana in a TradingView post. As the prices rise, the market can become overextended, leading to a bear market where prices fall and investor sentiment becomes negative.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart by AlanSantana. Source: TradingView\n\nThe expert also cautioned against the excessive hype surrounding the spot Bitcoin ETF, drawing parallels with past events like the Ethereum Merge. He suggested that intense hype often precedes bearish outcomes.\n\n\u201cThey say billions and billions and billions and billions and more will be coming in due to these ETFs, really? Here is the thing, these ETFs, these \u201cconventional trading vehicles\u201d are not going to be selling Bitcoins to their clients; they are going to be selling shares, coupons, digits on a screen or what not. If they need Bitcoins, they are buying it now or bought them long ago to later use as back-up for their customers funds,\u201d wrote AlanSantana\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin is currently trading at $37,727, which is very close to the upper \u2018Bollinger Band\u2019, according to EliteTradingSignals, a prominent crypto trader. This indicates that the pair is overbought and may be due for a pullback.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart by EliteTradingSignals. Source: TradingView\n\nThe fact that the one-week timeframe (TF) is green is a counter-signal, which indicates that there is a chance that the price could continue to rise in the long term. However, the short-term overbought condition suggests that a pullback is more likely, wrote the expert.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "One Bitcoin transaction uses as much water as filling a swimming pool - Earth.com",
        "content": "In a recent commentary, financial economist Alex de Vries has raised concerns about the significant amount of water consumed by cryptocurrency mining, particularly Bitcoin. This extensive water usage poses a threat to the global water supply, especially in water-scarce regions.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s water consumption\n\nDe Vries, a PhD student at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, highlights the burgeoning issue of Bitcoin\u2019s water footprint. \u201cMany parts of the world are experiencing droughts, and fresh water is becoming an increasing scarce resource,\u201d says de Vries (@Digiconomist). \u201cIf we continue to use this valuable resource for making useless computations, I think that reality is really painful.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the focus on cryptocurrency\u2019s environmental impact centered around its electricity consumption. Miners around the world actively compete to solve mathematical equations on the internet when mining Bitcoins, the most popular cryptocurrency. The winners receive a share of Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cThe right answer emerges every 10 minutes, and the rest of the data, quintillions of them, are computations that serve no further purpose and are therefore immediately discarded,\u201d de Vries says.\n\nIn the Bitcoin network, miners collectively generate about 350 quintillion guesses every second of the day, equating to 350 followed by 18 zeros. This process consumes a tremendous amount of computing power.\n\nQuantifying the impact\n\nDuring the mining process, large data centers use a significant amount of water to cool their computers. Alex de Vries, drawing on previous research data, estimates that Bitcoin mining in the U.S. consumes about 8.6 to 35.1 gigaliters (GL) of water annually from data centers.\n\nAdditionally, coal- and gas-fired power plants, which supply the electricity for these computers, also utilize water to cool down. This water, once used for cooling, evaporates and becomes unavailable for reuse. Similarly, water that evaporates from hydropower plants contributes to the overall water footprint of Bitcoin\u2019s power requirements.\n\nDe Vries estimates that Bitcoin mining used over 1,600 gigaliters (GL) of water globally in 2021. On average, each transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain consumes 16,000 liters of water, which is about 6.2 million times more than a credit card swipe, or sufficient to fill a backyard swimming pool. De Vries predicts that Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption will rise to 2,300 GL by 2023.\n\n\u201cThe price of Bitcoin just increased recently and reached its highest point of the year, despite the recent collapse of several cryptocurrency platforms. This will have serious consequences, because the higher the price, the higher the environmental impact,\u201d de Vries explains.\n\nThe environmental toll is exacerbated by the fact that these resources are not utilized for productive purposes like artificial intelligence but are instead expended on \u201cuseless computations.\u201d\n\nRegional implications\n\nCountries like Kazakhstan, a major hub for cryptocurrency mining, are already facing water shortages. In 2021, Bitcoin transactions in Kazakhstan accounted for 997.9 GL of water, adding to the country\u2019s water crisis.\n\nIn the U.S., the annual water consumption for Bitcoin mining, from all sources combined, ranges between 93 GL to 120 GL. This is equivalent to the water usage of 300,000 American households or a city like Washington, D.C.\n\nde Vries says. \u201cThe most painful thing about cryptocurrency mining is that it uses so much computational power and so much resources, but these resources are not going into creating some kind of model, like artificial intelligence, that you can then use for something else. It\u2019s just making useless computations.\u201d\n\nAddressing the challenge\n\nDe Vries suggests potential solutions, such as modifying Bitcoin mining\u2019s software to reduce power and water requirements. He also proposes incorporating renewable energy sources like wind and solar to lessen the water footprint. However, he cautions against diverting limited renewable resources to cryptocurrency mining at the expense of other essential uses.\n\n\u201cBut do you really want to spend wind and solar power for crypto? In many countries including the U.S., the amount of renewable energy is limited. Sure you can move some of these renewable energy sources to crypto, but that means something else will be powered with fossil fuels. I\u2019m not sure how much you gain,\u201d he says.\n\nWater, Bitcoin, and the future\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s value continues to grow, so does its environmental footprint. De Vries predicts that Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption will increase to 2,300 GL by 2023. This growing demand for water in the mining process could further exacerbate the global water crisis, especially in drought-prone areas.\n\nIn summary, the revelation of Bitcoin\u2019s significant water footprint by Alex de Vries serves as a wake-up call to the environmental implications of cryptocurrency mining. As the world grapples with water scarcity, the need for sustainable and responsible use of resources becomes more pressing.\n\nDe Vries\u2019s research underscores the importance of reassessing the environmental costs of emerging technologies like Bitcoin and seeking solutions that align with global sustainability goals.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability.\n\n\u2014\n\nLike what you read?

        "title": "Franklin Templeton\u2019s Jenny Johnson on Bitcoin ETFs, investing in crypto, and how her firm is harnessing the blockchain - Fortune",
        "content": "At the Fortune Global Forum Nov. 27\u201329 in Abu Dhabi, I had a chance to talk with Jenny Johnson, the president and CEO of Franklin Templeton, which has grown from a small brokerage founded in 1947 to a global giant that now manages over $1.3 trillion.\n\nAmong the top financial firms, Franklin Templeton has been at the forefront of exploring blockchain technology. In 2021, it launched the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain to process and record transactions, as well as crypto-focused separately managed accounts, or SMAs. And in September, the firm filed an application for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIn our conversation, Johnson discusses a variety of topics, including the role blockchain will play in her firm\u2019s long-term success and how it will help democratize markets.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFranklin Templeton has been actively exploring blockchain technology, recently filing an application for its Franklin Bitcoin ETF. Could you elaborate a bit on how blockchain fits into your long-term strategy?\n\nI think it\u2019s important that we differentiate Bitcoin and blockchain. I think that there\u2019s a demand for Bitcoin. It has its own use case, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these ETFs. What gets me more excited, as I think about the future, you look at blockchain technology, and it\u2019s going to enable access to things like private markets. It\u2019s going to enable the democratization of private markets. Well, why does it do that? This is because the technology takes out the frictional costs associated with processing transactions. And if you can reduce the friction in transactions, then you can more easily securitize or fractionalize ownership of things that would have been operationally too difficult to consider. Instead, you\u2019re able to create and transfer ownership of these hard-to-process assets much easier.\n\nIt\u2019s going to unlock nontraditional, non-correlated types of asset classes that are going to be interesting for our clients. We also think that it\u2019s going to make more efficient the types of products that you have today. ETFs trade all day, but only price twice a day. So, imagine that you build a pooled vehicle on the blockchain. When you transact, you can have the smart contract tell you exactly what the underlying value of those securities is. It\u2019s just a much more efficient way to be able to operate.\n\nAnd when you have atomic settlement or you have immediate settlement, it removes the potential for fraud, it takes out latency in the system. It\u2019s going to be all about efficiency. At Franklin Templeton, we developed a tokenized money-market fund. We built a shareholder recordkeeping system on that. We are a node validator, we actually advise on different portfolios. We have passive portfolios and active portfolios. While these are all in their early stages, they demonstrate that we\u2019re big believers in this space.\n\nWhen do you think the first Bitcoin spot ETF will be approved?\n\nI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s in the hands of the regulators, as they\u2019re trying to figure out the best approach. Their job is to protect the consumers, and I think they\u2019ll do it in time, as appropriate.\n\nHave you seen significant interest from clients for a Bitcoin spot ETF? Do you expect an influx of funds after it is approved?\n\nI think there\u2019s obviously a demand for Bitcoin, and I believe a spot ETF is a better way to access Bitcoin. As long as they trade, the bid-ask is narrow, it should be a better way to do it. It\u2019s a much more convenient way for anybody interested in investing in Bitcoin.\n\nBut I think Bitcoin has some challenges. It\u2019s hard to anchor to any kind of investment thesis. It tends to be a risk-on/risk-off type of asset. You just want to make sure clients are responsible in how they allocate Bitcoin.\n\nHow did you first discover blockchain and crypto?\n\nI ran the technology division years ago at Franklin Templeton. So I\u2019m always staying focused on new technological trends. This was one that I thought initially would take longer to mature, but I\u2019ve been impressed to see the various platforms and how quickly they\u2019ve matured, and the innovation that\u2019s happened in various companies that are being created on these layer-1s. But it was just because I spent about a third of my time on disruptive technologies, and it was one, just like AI, that I paid attention to.\n\nDo you personally invest in cryptocurrency?\n\nI do have some investments. It\u2019s small for my overall portfolio, but I definitely have investments there.\n\nCan you share some of your picks?\n\nWell, I haven\u2019t had more picks. They\u2019re all standard: Ethereum, a little Bitcoin, SushiSwap, Uniswap. I have a couple of different things like that.\n\nLooking ahead, do you plan to launch other blockchain- or crypto-related products? Some other wealth managers have, for example, crypto indexes or retirement plans or futures ETFs.\n\nETFs don\u2019t tend to be big in the retirement channel, but they may. Retirement plans have fiduciaries that make the decision about what investments are on there. So that would be the choice of the fiduciary. Our job is to make the products available.\n\nYou\u2019ve had big success with your U.S. money-market fund, which is tokenized and has inflows of over $ 270 million. Do you plan to tokenize any other funds?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I think that technology is a really great opportunity. And as it matures, there\u2019ll be more investment opportunities. I always say, at Franklin Templeton, our expertise is in making active, risk-adjusted investment decisions, and we deliver them in whatever vehicle our clients would like us to deliver them. Blockchain creates one type of vehicle with tokenization, and so, yes, we do see it as a channel to ultimately be able to deliver our expertise.\n\nFranklin Templeton ventured into the world of NFTs by issuing some to attendees of your first Innovation Forum last year. What use cases do you see for NFTs, and how do you feel about them personally?\n\nLook, I think as in anything, there\u2019s mature investments that make a lot of sense. And then there\u2019s a lot that don\u2019t make any sense. I tend to make investments in things that I think are anchored in having financial returns, because I think that you have better chances of success there. There are some things that are like art in an NFT, where if two people love it, they will find a market price for it. And so, there\u2019s going to be opportunities in that space. Not all will be successful, not all will be good, but there will be some that are successful."
