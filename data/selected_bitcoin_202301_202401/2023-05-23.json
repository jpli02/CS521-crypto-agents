        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices moved higher on Tuesday after Hong Kong's securities regulator announced it will allow retail trading of certain crypto assets starting June 1.\n\nBitcoin rose 1.7% to $27,293.64, according to Coin Metrics. The largest cryptocurrency has been trading in a small range throughout May, struggling to break above $30,000 but staying above $25,000. Ether advanced nearly 2% to $1,851.91.\n\nLate Monday night, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission said it would allow retail investors to trade certain crypto assets beginning next month on registered trading platforms. The move was widely expected, with the announcement marking the end of a request for public comment it put out in February on its proposed regulatory requirements around retail trading in crypto.\n\nThe new guidelines are part of a broader effort of Hong Kong's to become a global crypto hub. That ambition is in sharp contrast with China, which banned crypto trading in 2021, as well as the U.S. where the regulatory stance toward crypto has turned hostile since the collapse of FTX.\n\n\"This news doesn't mean that a flood of retail buying power will enter the market at the beginning of June. \u2026 We could see some volume uptick in June, however,\" said Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter.\n\nHong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission has already licensed two digital asset platforms, OSL and Hash Blockchain, and it's likely some are already actively trading offshore, Acheson said."

        "content": "Canadian Bitcoin mining corporation Upstream Data Inc. has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Delaware limited liability company Crusoe Energy Systems LLC in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Crusoe has infringed on Upstream's patent related to bitcoin mining technology used to convert stranded natural gas into bitcoin. According to the complaint, Upstream holds the patent for a system that powers a blockchain mine at remote oil well sites using stranded gas to generate electricity for cryptocurrency mining. According to the filing, the company has deployed over 350 bitcoin mining systems across the U.S. and Canada, addressing the issue of stranded gas venting and flaring.\n\nCrusoe, which manufactures and operates cryptocurrency mining systems connected to stranded natural gas sources, is accused of competing with Upstream by selling and operating similar systems. The complaint claims that Crusoe's \"Digital Flare Mitigation\" systems infringe on Upstream's patented technology. The lawsuit further alleges that Crusoe was aware of Upstream's patented technology during the development of its own products. The lawsuit filing highlights instances where Crusoe identified Upstream as a competitor in blog posts and claims made in patent applications.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief against Crusoe for patent infringement. Upstream argues that Crusoe's actions have caused harm to its business by infringing on its patent rights and creating unfair competition in the market.\n\nThe case will be heard in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, where Crusoe has regular and established places of business according to the filing. Also noted in the lawsuit is a complaint filed against a customer of Upstream in Crusoe Energy Systems LLC v. Alkane Midstream LLC, which the lawsuit says \"further confirm[s] Crusoe\u2019s significant and substantial contacts with this district.\" Upstream asserts in the lawsuit that the court has jurisdiction over the case.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Photo: Florence Lo/Reuters (Florence Lo / reuters)\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has risen over 2% as investors eye the ongoing stalemate over the US debt ceiling and anticipate a positive crypto move in China.\n\nBitcoin was trading around $27,500 (\u00a322,175) on Tuesday, up 0.8% in the week.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap stood at $1.19tn, up 1.8%.\n\nInvestors are monitoring developments in Hong Kong and China, in anticipation of a proposed plan that could permit retail investors in Hong Kong and institutional investors in mainland China to trade cryptocurrencies through Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission is set to reveal the consultation conclusions on retail participation at a Tuesday briefing, with a plan to launch a licensing regime for digital asset platforms on 1 June.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nThis move is not without controversy, given the global crypto market's turmoil in 2022 and the collapse of the FTX exchange.\n\nBitcoin has hovered between $26,500 and $27,500 in the past fortnight, amidst US debt ceiling talks between president Joe Biden and House leaders, according to Coingecko.\n\nThe US Treasury Department affirmed on Monday that it could only fulfil the government's financial responsibilities until 1 June without a debt limit hike, leaving a 10-day window for an agreement between White House negotiators and congressional Republicans.\n\nAlthough analysts believe the risk of a US default is minimal, if it does occur it could potentially cause cryptocurrencies to plummet.\n\nBitcoin was given a confidence boost by co-founder of MicroStrategy (MSTR) Michael Saylor, who said that bitcoin is entering a new bull market.\n\nHe attributes this upswing to the bitcoin halving process, increased adoption, and the anticipated regulatory crackdown on the wider crypto industry, which could favour bitcoin.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC he said he foresees a shift of investor and developer interest from other blockchains to bitcoin as regulations weed out other competing cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nWatch: Japan vies to be 'number one again through web3 innovation' | The Crypto Mile\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."
