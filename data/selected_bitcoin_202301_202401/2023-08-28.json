        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Mining Hashprice Nears Record Low as Token Price Stagnates - Bloomberg",
        "content": "One closely-watched measure of Bitcoin mining revenue is hovering around a record low as the price of the largest digital asset stagnates and competition heats up.\n\nThe so-called hashprice fell to $0.06 for a unit of computing power per day on Sunday, according to Hashrate Index data. That is close to the record low seen around late 2022 when major publicly-traded mining companies warned of a liquidity crunch and some declared bankruptcy."
