        "content": "Crypto Ads Could Start Appearing on Google After Tech Giant Revised Policy\n\nGoogle is set to update its ad policies on Monday, January 29, allowing certain cryptocurrency products to be advertised. This policy change could see advertisements for the recently-launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) appear on its search engines.\n\nHowever, Google's policy update refers to the allowed products as \"advertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States,\" leaving some ambiguity. Notably, one of the largest Bitcoin trusts, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), recently converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF following the SEC's approval.\n\nPreviously, GBTC shares were only available to accredited investors on the primary market, subject to a six-month holding period. Accredited investors must meet specific financial criteria, such as having a net worth over $1 million or a high earned income.\n\nIn contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs are available to the general public in the United States and are regulated under the Securities Act of 1933. This makes them a potentially safer option for Google to consider in advertising. The policy update is seen as a positive development, especially given Google's vast reach and influence in driving awareness and inflows for the 10 spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT currently leads with the largest AUM, which recently surpassed $2 billion."

        "content": "ARK Invest Sells Bitcoin Futures ETF, Buys $65M Worth of its Own Spot BTC ETF\n\nARK Invest, the investment firm led by Cathie Wood, has made significant adjustments to its cryptocurrency portfolio in recent weeks, selling shares of the Bitcoin Futures ETF, ProShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (BITO). Since January 19, ARK Invest has sold a total of 2,226,191 shares of BITO, worth approximately $45.2 million as of Friday\u2019s market close, from its Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).\n\nConcurrently, it has accumulated its own spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which was launched on January 11. So far, it has purchased 1,563,619 shares of ARKB, valued at roughly $65.7 million. ARKW now holds $91.5 million worth of ARKB, representing a 5.98% weighting of the fund's total value. In contrast, its BITO shares have dwindled to just 366,128, valued at $7 million, constituting a mere 0.46% weighting.\n\nARK Invest's divestment from BITO is consistent with its earlier strategy of holding BITO as a short-term play in anticipation of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. The firm had previously sold its shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) late last year, expecting to replace BITO with a spot Bitcoin ETF once it became available.\n\nARK Invest recently sold $5.2 million worth of Coinbase shares (COIN) after the US-based crypto exchange surged in anticipation of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Coinbase is named as the custodian of numerous spot ETF issuers. However, Cathie Wood remains bullish on the Bitcoin and crypto sector, famously calling a Bitcoin price target of $1.5 million by 2030."

        "title": "UK looks increasingly isolated in its anti-crypto ETF stance - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nThe UK is becoming increasingly isolated as one of the few major global markets to continue to hold back from approving retail access to cryptocurrency exchange traded products.\n\nContinental Europe has them, as do Australia, Brazil and Canada. The US has followed suit most recently with spot bitcoin ETFs, prompting Hong Kong to say it will also jump on board.\n\nYet the UK will not even let small investors buy those listed elsewhere even though Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has championed the UK as a crypto hub and has advocated for a regulatory framework that allows the sector to flourish in Britain.\n\nThe high-profile launch of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street earlier this month, some managed by household names such as BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity, has heightened the UK\u2019s divergence from most other financial hubs.\n\nThe UK\u2019s stance was defined by a ruling in 2021, when its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, banned the sale of cryptocurrency-related \u201cderivatives\u201d \u2014 including exchange traded products \u2014 to UK retail investors.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s ban appeared to be largely motivated by the emergence of leveraged products such as contracts for difference, with some operators offering as much as 100 times leverage on bitcoin, itself a highly volatile token. However, it also swept up unleveraged products such as plain vanilla ETPs and futures.\n\nSome industry figures disagree with where the FCA has chosen to draw the line. It did not intervene, for example, in the trading by retail investors of digital tokens directly via crypto exchanges.\n\nUK retail investors \u201ccan invest in crypto, just not through the regulated products\u201d, said Bradley Duke, chief strategist of London-based ETC Group. Its $1bn Physical Bitcoin exchange traded commodity is listed on Euronext Amsterdam and Paris, Frankfurt\u2019s Xetra exchange, the SIX Swiss Exchange and Chicago\u2019s CBOE, but cannot be on the London stock exchange because of the retail ban. In aggregate, continental Europe boasts 120 crypto ETPs with \u20ac8.4bn of assets, according to TrackInsight.\n\n\u201cA UK retail investor can\u2019t invest in a product like ours, a Mifid II [EU regulated] instrument, listed on a regulated exchange and sold through a regulated broker, who would screen you for applicability, depending on your investment objectives and profile,\u201d Duke said.\n\n\u201cBut they can go to a crypto exchange and buy bitcoin without going through any checks and balances, and to me that doesn\u2019t really make sense.\u201d\n\nAndrew Prosser, head of investments at InvestEngine, a London-based investment platform whose 34,000 clients hold \u00a3320mn across almost 600 ETFs, said UK retail investors had two options if they want crypto exposure.\n\n\u201cThey can either buy the coins themselves from digital exchanges. That comes with several problems: the need for digital wallets, private keys, the risk of theft. Or they can buy the shares of companies that track crypto, such as exchanges or miners,\u201d Prosser said.\n\nHe said there were lots of requests on InvestEngine\u2019s community forum for ETPs investing directly in crypto. \u201cSo there is demand for it,\u201d he said.\n\nHector McNeil, co-founder and co-chief executive of London-based HANetf, which lists six ETC Group cryptocurrency vehicles on its ETF platform, said it was \u201cgetting a lot more calls from advisers and discretionary fund managers\u201d, about crypto since this month\u2019s flurry of US launches.\n\nMcNeil said that the recent launches in the US with managers such as BlackRock and Invesco getting involved, meant the asset class was now mainstream. \u201cI think the FCA will have to reassess their position,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he did not believe the regulator should completely open the floodgates to all of the UK\u2019s estimated 9mn self-directed investors.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with general access,\u201d he said, adding that with any more complex product there should be \u201csome sort of gating\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s somebody like me putting 3 per cent of their portfolio in, that should be fine. If it\u2019s my mother wanting to put 100 per cent in because her friend down the social club told her she made loads of money, then I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d McNeil added.\n\nBut he also said crypto ETPs were \u201cno more complex\u201d than inverse or leveraged products, where \u201cthere is a procedure for brokers to give access\u201d to investors who pass a suitability test and have an adequate balance sheet.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me it\u2019s more risky that trading 30 times leverage on a CFD [contract for difference] or spread bet,\u201d McNeil added.\n\nAll the UK regulator had done, he said, is to \u201cpush people to dodgy crypto exchanges. I don\u2019t think they have achieved what they wanted to achieve.\u201d\n\nSmall investors \u201care going through unregulated or under-regulated exchanges where there is no broker involved and there is no one looking out for the suitability of their investments\u201d, said Duke. \u201cThey have to hold the cryptocurrency themselves, which is risky.\u201d\n\nDespite these arguments, Prosser is not convinced the FCA, which declined to comment for this story, will buckle. When the regulator announced its ban in 2021 it also raised concerns about the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the underlying crypto market, its volatility and its links to financial crime.\n\n\u201cUnless the case can be made that crypto has meaningfully changed in the last three years, it\u2019s hard to see why the FCA would authorise them,\u201d Prosser said, while the FCA\u2019s Consumer Duty rules requiring companies to demonstrate fair value for clients, introduced last year, \u201cplaces a lot more duty to assess risk on investment platforms\u201d.\n\nJason Hollands, managing director of Bestinvest, a DIY investing platform, agreed.\n\n\u201cI am personally doubtful that the FCA will authorise bitcoin or other cryptocurrency ETFs to be made accessible to UK retail investors any time soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FCA has repeatedly flagged concerns about the extreme volatility of cryptoassets, the high risk of losses and the difficulties retail investors face in valuing them.\u201d"
