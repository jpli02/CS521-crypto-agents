        "content": "Bitcoin Could Fall to $30,000 in 2024, Says Crypto Billionaire Arthur Hayes\n\nArthur Hayes predicted in a recent market commentary that Bitcoin could plunge to $30,000 in 2024.\n\nHayes, a Bitcoin billionaire known for founding the BitMEX crypto derivatives exchange, published his forecast in a blog post on Wednesday. He warned that Bitcoin could sink as low as $30,000 - $35,000 amidst a potential market downturn triggered by issues in traditional finance.\n\n\"I believe Bitcoin will dip before the BTFP renewal decision on March 12th. I didn\u2019t expect it to happen so soon, but I think Bitcoin will find a local bottom between $30,000 and $35,000,\" wrote Hayes.\n\nThe prediction comes as Bitcoin hovers under $40,000. Hayes blamed the Bitcoin slump on outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the looming expiration of a key Federal Reserve liquidity program.\n\nHayes argued the Fed would likely let its Bank Term Funding Program expire in March instead of renewing it. That could spark a \"mini-financial crisis\" and force the Fed to resume money printing to bail out struggling regional banks.\n\nBitcoin often rallies on expectations of looser Fed policy. But Hayes says the leading cryptocurrency is flashing warning signs that the Fed won't ride to the rescue this time.\n\n\"Bitcoin is telling the world that the Fed is trapped between inflation and a banking crisis,\" explained Hayes. \"The market doesn\u2019t appreciate this fact yet, but Bitcoin does.\"\n\nOnce Bitcoin sinks below $35,000, Hayes says he'll scoop up discounted coins ahead of an eventual Fed policy reversal."

        "content": "11 Publicly-Listed Bitcoin Miners May Not Mine Profitably After Halving: Report\n\nA recent analysis by financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald has raised concerns among Bitcoin miners, suggesting that many may struggle to maintain profitability following the upcoming halving event. The report highlights that eleven of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners could face significant financial pressure if the price of BTC remains at the current $40,000 level after the halving.\n\nThe report identifies Argo Blockchain and Hut 8 Mining as the two miners most likely to face profitability issues after the halving, with their \"all in\" cost-per-coin rates currently exceeding the current Bitcoin price. In total, 11 Bitcoin miners have estimated cost-per-coin exceed the $40,000 level.\n\nIn contrast, Cantor analysts expect Singapore-based Bitdeer and U.S.-based CleanSpark to remain profitable, assuming an average Bitcoin price of $40,000 and no significant changes in hash rate. The report estimated that the cost-per-coin for Bitdeer is $17,744, while CleanSpark\u2019s stands at $36,896.\n\nThe analysis was cited by CleanSpark executive chairman and co-founder Matthew Shultz in a January 25th post.\n\nAs Bitcoin miners' revenues are directly tied to the price of Bitcoin, miners may experience increased challenges in ensuring the revenue generated from mining Bitcoin can be profitable after covering operational costs.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April, involves a 50% reduction in the block rewards received by Bitcoin miners. While this supply reduction is generally viewed as bullish for Bitcoin's long-term price prospects, it also means that miners with high operational costs could face severe challenges if the price of Bitcoin does not rise sufficiently to cover these costs."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSo how\u2019s everyone doing in Bitcoin-land?\n\nNot so good! The chart above shows a drop of nearly 20 per cent in two weeks. As Bryce noted last week, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has mostly been a chance to cash out of arbitrage trades.\n\nUntil recently, traders were able to buy the biggest US Bitcoin investment vehicle \u2014 a fund run by Grayscale \u2014 at a discount to its net asset value. This is because, before approval, investors weren\u2019t actually able to make withdrawals.\n\nNow they can, as the SEC approved Grayscale\u2019s request to convert into an ETF. The fund (ticker GBTC) has seen $4.3bn in outflows since then, says JPMorgan in a note Thursday.\n\nAt first one theory was that investors were shifting out of GBTC and into spot Bitcoin ETFs with lower fees. But the price action suggests otherwise.\n\nFrom JPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou:\n\nProfit-taking on previous GBTC investments, made at a discount to NAV last year, has likely been a major driver behind bitcoin\u2019s correction; $4.3bn has thus far exited GBTC since its conversion to ETF. When profits are booked on GBTC \u2018s \u201cdiscount to NAV trade\u201d the money exits the crypto space, thus putting downward pressure on prices. We believe that most of this $4.3bn GBTC outflow reflects profit taking rather than a shift towards cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs (needless to say that such a shift would have had little market impact).\n\nThere could be a silver lining, though. Panigirtzoglou & Co have previously estimated that about $3bn of GBTC\u2019s assets came from traders investing solely to take advantage of its discount.\n\nSo it\u2019s possible that after $4.3bn of withdrawals, \u201cGBTC profit taking has largely happened already. In turn, this would imply that most of the downward pressure on bitcoin from that channel should be largely behind us,\u201d the team write.\n\nAnd what about the leftover $1.3bn? If we take the most optimistic view, we would assume that all of that cash moved into competing lower-cost Bitcoin ETFs. Of course, that would mean investors aren\u2019t just selling in favour of safer and higher-yielding alternatives (such as US government debt), which seems like a very bold assumption.\n\nStill, JPMorgan argues that the US ETF approvals mean there will be a \u201csignificant change\u201d in the market structure for Bitcoin:\n\n- Before 2023, the price discovery was done via trading across offshore spot exchanges, onshore spot exchanges, offshore futures and onshore (CME) futures. Following last year\u2019s crackdown from US policy makers the importance of offshore marketplaces has diminished to the benefit of onshore spot exchanges and CME bitcoin futures. The emergence of spot ETFs is introducing another dimension in the bitcoin price discovery process along with onshore spot exchanges and onshore futures that echoes the price discovery that is taking place in the traditional financial system, in particular in equities where ETFs are more prevalent. - While, at face value, the introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs implies more fragmentation, in practice it would increase market depth and liquidity if the experience of ETFs in traditional asset classes such as equities is a guide. In other words, we expect that the emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs would make the bitcoin price discovery process more rather than less efficient.\n\nOh and Grayscale is trying to make a covered call Bitcoin ETF happen, which should be interesting:\n\nFinally, GBTC\u2019s plan to introduce a covered call ETF is another step towards increasing market depth and liquidity for its ETF bolstering its status as the most liquid bitcoin fund. These vehicles are often used in the equity space to achieve exposure with less risk (the premiums from selling call options in covered call ETFs tend to offset losses in a declining market, albeit with the tradeoff of smaller gains in a big bull market). If approved, covered call ETFs would be a boost for GBTC\u2019s and, more broadly, bitcoin\u2019s derivatives markets.\n\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af"

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving 2024: What to Expect? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBTC halving will occur when the number of blocks reaches 840,000 in April 2024. Then, the reward per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.\n\nUsually, the bitcoin price rises for about six months before halving and is rather stable during the event. The primary growth occurs in the year following the halving.\n\nIf Bitcoin mirrors its performance from the previous two periods, its price could reach the $220k mark in 2025.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) halving will occur in April 2024, resulting in a 50% reduction in bitcoin mining speed. Historically, this event catalyses value growth and, therefore, attracts the attention of investors. To determine whether Bitcoin halving will push BTC to new heights, let\u2019s explore and analyse the dynamics together\n\nBitcoin, Mining, Halving \u2014 What You Need To Know\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a decentralised computer network. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown group of individuals, or, according to some sources, a person named Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin\u2019s defining feature lies in its capped supply of 21 million coins acquired through the mining process. Mining uses computer power to solve complex mathematical puzzles and verify transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nNewly mined bitcoins are given to miners as a reward for their labour. However, the number of bitcoins miners receive for each block (set of transactions) varies. Every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half. This phenomenon is referred to as \u2018BTC halving\u2019 or \u2018halving\u2019.\n\nThe purpose of Bitcoin halving is to maintain the currency\u2019s scarcity and value while managing the inflation rate. The assumption is that as the number of new bitcoins issued decreases, demand for them will increase, and prices will rise accordingly. This is based on the economic concept of supply and demand. However, a halving event doubles the cost and complexity of mining, reducing miners\u2019 profitability. This could lead to some miners leaving the market, reducing the hash rate\u2014the overall computing power of the network\u2014and potentially impacting its security.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving will occur when the number of blocks reaches 840,000 in April 2024. The reward per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC at that time. This will be the fourth halving of the leading cryptocurrency in history. The previous three halvings occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020.\n\nIs It Possible To Make Money From BTC Halving?\n\nAssuming constant demand, halving the supply is expected to double the asset\u2019s value. Historical data indicates that investing in Bitcoin prior to a halving event has been a profitable strategy.\n\n\u2018Usually, bitcoin starts to rise about six months before the halving, and it doesn\u2019t change much during the halving period,\u2019 said Kar Yong Ang, the Octa financial market analyst. \u2018On average, in the past, the upper peak of the exchange rate can be observed more than a year after halving,\u2019 he added.\n\nExamining the price dynamics in the year preceding and following the halving events over the last three cycles reveals significant growth for Bitcoin. During these two-year spans, Bitcoin experienced remarkable increases: approximately 30,000% in 2012, 786% in 2016, and 712% in 2020. If Bitcoin continues to show the same performance this time, its price could reach the $220k mark in 2025.\n\nFor traders, it is important to focus on a shorter timeframe. Notably, 150 days after the first halving, the price of BTC surged by 928%, followed by a 16.6% increase after the second halving and a subsequent 25.8% rise after the third.\n\nHowever, as factors such as significant hacks or bankruptcies of crypto companies, stock market conditions, whale manipulation, or regulatory changes reduce the coin issuance, future halving events may be less potent.\n\nAbout Octa\n\n\n\nOcta is an international broker that has been providing online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers commission-free access to financial markets and various services already utilised by clients from 180 countries with more than 42 million trading accounts.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nThe first derivative-based strategy piggybacking off US-listed bitcoin exchange traded funds has started trading, as experimentation in the fund industry accelerates at breakneck speed.\n\nRoundhill Investments\u2019 Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (YBTC) aims to generate a yield from bitcoin and, like other covered call strategies such as JPMorgan\u2019s wildly popular Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), investors surrender some potential market gains in return.\n\n\u201cThis is a unique intersection of two areas that have been very much in demand, income generation and crypto,\u201d said David Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill.\n\nYBTC is among the first in an anticipated wave of novel ETF launches in the wake of the recent approval of US-listed \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin ETFs investing directly in the cryptocurrency, industry observers say.\n\n\u201cWe are at the beginning, not the end, of ETF innovation tied to cryptocurrencies. The door is open to bring strategies to the public that provide exposure to bitcoin in a risk-on and risk-off manner,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy.\n\nCrypto powerhouse Grayscale Investments has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Bitcoin Trust Covered Call ETF, which would be based on options on its $23.5bn Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), the world\u2019s largest crypto fund.\n\nOther novel ETFs in the works include proposed vehicles from ProShares and Direxion, which have each filed to launch five ETFs offering leveraged and inverse exposure to bitcoin, amplifying the swings of the already volatile asset.\n\nCovered call ETFs are designed to do the opposite: reduce risk. They work by selling out-of-the-money call options, allowing the purchasers to buy the underlying asset, in this case bitcoin, at a set price and a fixed expiration date. If bitcoin rises sufficiently for this option to be triggered, this caps upside returns for investors, meaning they may underperform the rise in the digital asset.\n\nHowever, the ETF pockets the premium income from writing the options irrespective of what happens \u2014 cushioning investors if the options are triggered, or helping them outperform if they are not.\n\nMazza argued that bitcoin\u2019s high volatility meant it was ideally suited to this approach.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re combining crypto, particularly bitcoin, with a covered call strategy, one of the biggest things is the potential for higher income,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause bitcoin is so volatile as an instrument, when you are selling and capping some of your upside, the benefit is that you get paid a pretty attractive premium for doing so. It has the potential to get a higher yield than you would get with equities.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cmanufactured\u201d income stream may be welcome to some investors because bitcoin has no yield. This is because \u201cmining\u201d of new coins works on the basis of \u201cproof of work\u201d.\n\nMany other cryptocurrencies, such as ether, cardano and polkadot, instead use a \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d mechanism. This allows investors to lock away crypto assets for a set period of time to help support the operation of the blockchain. In return they earn more cryptocurrency, effectively generating income.\n\n\u201cBeing able to invest in GBTC and have a passive long-term exposure to bitcoin, while also allowing having an additional income or yield, is quite attractive,\u201d said Michael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale.\n\nRosenbluth saw a potential market for covered call ETFs. \u201cThe number one concern that we hear from advisers about bitcoin is that it is volatile, so these products would help alleviate some of these concerns by having some downside protection and income generation,\u201d Rosenbluth said.\n\nBut he pointed out the reverse could also be true. \u201cThe counter is that many people want exposure to bitcoin to take advantage of that volatility. They like that it\u2019s a high-risk/high-reward experience.\u201d\n\nBryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America at Morningstar, also pointed to the allure of volatility, saying he did not \u201cunderstand the desire for a bitcoin covered call ETF\u201d.\n\n\u201cVolatility is why investors buy bitcoin \u2014 capping upside seems antithetical to its investment thesis,\u201d Armour said. He added that a covered call ETF \u201ckeeps the tail risk of bitcoin, meaning if it craters like it did in 2022, investors will still lose a substantial amount of their investment. I don\u2019t see these as a useful product for most investors.\u201d\n\nUntil this month Grayscale\u2019s GBTC was a private trust traded on the over-the-counter market. As such, there were no options listed on it. Sonnenshein hinted that this picture was changing.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to GBTC and growing the ecosystem around it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of investor interest and excitement about the development of an options ecosystem.\u201d\n\nRoundhill, which does not have its own spot bitcoin ETF, is instead basing its options on the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), at $1.8bn by far the largest bitcoin futures ETF.\n\nThis is because, as yet, there are no options listed on the new spot ETFs, although several exchanges have filed with the SEC to launch them.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\n\u201cWe are closely monitoring what occurs with spot ETFs,\u201d said Mazza, who added that YBTC has the freedom to \u201cpivot to where the largest options market is\u201d.\n\nYBTC has a fee of 95 basis points. Grayscale has yet to provide details of its proposed ETF.\n\nRosenbluth believed many more flavours of bitcoin exposure were likely to be on the way in the US.\n\nBuffered ETFs \u2014 which use options to provide some downside protection \u2014 are one possibility. Other vehicles such as the Cyber Hornet S&P 500 and Bitcoin 75/25 Strategy ETF (ZZZ), which provides exposure to bitcoin futures and Wall Street stocks, launched late last year.\n\n\u201cIt seems inevitable that we see more asset allocation approaches that incorporate bitcoin exposure in that package.\u201d Rosenbluth said."
