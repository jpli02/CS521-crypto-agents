The funny money topped $42,000 for the first time in 19 months as frenzied speculation in cryptocurrencies (as if there were another kind) extended a rally in the largest digital token to more than 150% this year. Bitcoin rose as much as 6.1% on Monday in New York, on track for the biggest annual gain since 2020. Smaller tokens such as Ether and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin also pushed higher. Bitcoin Cash jumped 8% and a gauge of the largest 100 crypto coins added more than 3.3%. So what\u2019s driving this? Three letters: ETF.\n\nWall Street kicked off the week with losses, with both stocks and bonds down in a signal that traders\u2019 aggressive pricing of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve may have gone too far.

        "content": "Bitcoin built on its recent rally and hit its highest level in more than a year on Monday, bolstered by anticipation of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund approval and bets on U.S. interest rate cuts.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency surged more than 5% on Monday to a 19-month high, and was trading at $41,809 as of 4:00 pm ET after briefly topping $42,000 earlier in the day, based on Coin Metrics data. This is the first time since April 2022 that bitcoin has breached the $40,000 level, according to LSEG. Bitcoin is now up more than 150% from the start of the year.\n\nThis comes after scandals rocked the market including the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November last year. Last month, FTX founder Bankman-Fried was found guilty of all seven criminal charges brought against him related to the collapse of his crypto empire.\n\n\"Now that $40,000 has been revisited for the first time in almost 19 months, $48,000 and $52,000 look to be the next significant lines in the sand,\" said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of digital asset company Nexo.\n\nCNBC reported last week that U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission officials met with representatives from Grayscale, BlackRock and the Nasdaq. In a memo, the SEC said it met with Grayscale on Thursday about the potential conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The SEC had previously blocked this move, but Grayscale challenged that decision in court and won."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nBitcoin surged to its highest price in nearly 20 months while gold hit an all-time peak on Monday, as frenzied investor speculation that interest rates will fall next year rippled through assets across the globe.\n\nThe cryptocurrency soared to more than $42,000 on Monday, also boosted by optimism that the toughest regulatory punishments for the industry have passed. It later fell back to $41,662, up 7.4 per cent on the previous day.\n\nGold rallied as much as 3 per cent to $2,135 per troy ounce on Monday, a new record, before slipping to $2,025 per troy ounce, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe moves follow a recent rush into stocks and bonds, fuelled by growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve will soon cut borrowing costs despite chair Jay Powell\u2019s assertion on Friday that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to conclude that the central bank has won its battle with inflation.\n\n\u201cYou look at bitcoin and gold and you see a very similar kind of evolution,\u201d said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \u201cAll the asset classes that tend to do well when the Fed cuts rates aggressively are doing well.\u201d\n\nTraders are now betting the first rate reduction could come as soon as March after a sharp decline in government and corporate borrowing costs as US bond markets enjoyed their biggest monthly rally in nearly four decades in November.\n\nLower yields on ultra-safe US Treasury debt have made other assets relatively more attractive to investors. The S&P 500 index closed at its highest level since March 2022 last week, although it was down 0.6 per cent midway through Monday\u2019s session. Recent US economic data has been resilient even while inflation has fallen, further boosting risky assets such as stocks.\n\nMax Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at HSBC, said markets were in the grip of an \u201ceveryone-is-happy-Goldilocks rally\u201d across \u201cvirtually all asset classes\u201d.\n\nTraders said the momentum to buy bitcoin, whose value has climbed more than a fifth in the past month, was also driven by growing interest among investors after the closure of two of the most high-profile criminal cases that had hung over the market for the past year.\n\nLast month the US successfully prosecuted Sam Bankman-Fried, former chief executive of FTX, and Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud and Binance paid $4.3bn in penalties after pleading guilty to criminal charges related to money laundering and financial sanctions breaches.\n\nBut despite many traders\u2019 fears, US authorities did not shut down Binance. The cryptocurrency exchange continues to face a separate lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly violating securities laws.\n\n\u201cThe message from many institutional investors was that they needed two things before looking at the space again: closure on FTX and clarity around Binance,\u201d said Henri Arslanian, co-founder of Nine Blocks Management, a crypto hedge fund manager based in Dubai.\n\nEthereum, the second most actively traded cryptocurrency, also rose 8.3 per cent to $2,260 on Monday, its highest level since May last year.\n\nInvestors are also hopeful the SEC will approve an exchange traded fund for bitcoin in coming weeks. The regulator has refused for a decade to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, stock market funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency.\n\nSome of Wall Street\u2019s largest investors, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have joined companies such as VanEck and WisdomTree in submitting filings with the SEC.\n\nThe market has long viewed spot bitcoin ETFs as a way to wrest control of digital assets from scandal-ridden crypto groups in favour of mainstream businesses such as BlackRock.\n\n\u201cETF speculation is going to continue to drive behaviour in the crypto market this week as investors buy into the narrative of the transformative impact opening the market to institutional investors will have on the ecosystem,\u201d said Simon Peters, market analyst at eToro.\n\nWhile the SEC has embarked on a year-long crackdown on crypto \u2014 including enforcement actions against groups such as US-listed exchange Coinbase \u2014 pressure is growing on the regulator to approve a bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nCrypto asset manager Grayscale scored a watershed legal victory this year when a federal appeals court ruled the SEC was wrong to reject its application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF."

However, our opinions are our own. See how we rate investing products to write unbiased product reviews.\n\nBitcoin investing involves picking an exchange, verifying identity, and withdrawing to a wallet.\n\nInvesting in bitcoin is risky since it's a volatile and speculative asset.\n\nExperts recommend a buy-and-hold strategy when buying bitcoin to average out rises and falls.\n\neToro is one of the best exchanges for buying cryptocurrency.\n\nMore than a decade into its existence, Bitcoin doesn't seem to be going away. The cryptocurrency has attracted good and bad headlines as it's worked its way through multiple peaks over the years, and despite a reputation for volatility, it continues to attract new investors with its promise of market-beating returns.\n\nHere's what to know about investing in Bitcoin.\n\nHow to buy bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency. This means it's a form of electronic money that secures and validates transactions via the use of cryptography. In Bitcoin's case, people and organizations known as \"miners\" use computing hardware to calculate a code \u2014 known as a \"hash\" \u2014 that encrypts the data contained in transactions. This data is collected into \"blocks,\" which are linked together in a blockchain that cannot, in theory, be changed once written.\n\nOn an economic level, Bitcoin's creator \u2014 the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 created it in 2008 as a form of \"sound money,\" akin to digital gold.\n\n\"What makes Bitcoin so special is that it has a finite supply of 21 million coins, with only a couple million left to be mined,\" explains Edward Moya, chief market strategist at OANDA's MarketPulse. \"Simple supply and demand for Bitcoin is the main reason why prices have skyrocketed over the past year.\"\n\nDespite having a fixed maximum supply, Bitcoin has shown remarkable volatility throughout most of its life with major fluctuations in its price.\n\nSuch swings make Bitcoin a highly speculative asset, one that should be considered only by traders willing to stomach a fair amount of risk. That said, at least some analysts suspect that its volatility will gradually decline over time, as its market grows and reduces its destabilizing reliance on leverage.\n\n1. Choose a crypto exchange\n\nFor most people, the best place to buy Bitcoin is on a crypto exchange. These are online platforms dedicated to facilitating trades in cryptocurrency, usually by offering trading pairs (e.g., USD to Bitcoin) and usually by matching buyers with sellers.\n\nMore inexperienced traders may wish to try a more general trading platform such as Robinhood. These have the benefit of being more user-friendly than the average crypto exchange, although their major downside is that many don't let users withdraw their bitcoin.\n\nQuick tip: New investors should check the fees charged by exchanges, since these can vary quite widely. They should also check for the minimum account balance required by their chosen platform, since certain exchanges impose a minimum. Others also set minimums for account deposits via bank transfer.\n\n2. Choose a payment method\n\nExchanges also vary in terms of the payment methods they support. Most major platforms do offer the option of linking your bank account for wire and ACH transfers, as well as the option of linking a debit card. Some also let you pay via PayPal.\n\nRegardless of the option you choose, you will have to verify your identity when first signing up for an account and registering a payment method. In the US, you're usually required to submit a scan of a state-issued ID, such as a driver's license or identification card.\n\nDepending on where you are and on your chosen platform, you may also be required to provide scans of additional documentation (such as your passport), as well as being asked to submit a proof of address.\n\n3. Place your order\n\nOnce you're verified and have deposited cash into your account, you can then begin buying Bitcoin. This process varies according to the exchange you use, with some exchanges offering a process that simply involves clicking a Buy or Sell button and then specifying how much Bitcoin you want to buy (or sell).\n\nIn general, most crypto exchanges offer at least three basic order types:\n\nMarket order : the option to choose if you simply want to buy Bitcoin at its current price. This type of order is usually completed in a matter of seconds, depending on the time of day.\n\n: the option to choose if you simply want to buy Bitcoin at its current price. This type of order is usually completed in a matter of seconds, depending on the time of day. Stop order : an order where you specify the price at which you will buy or sell Bitcoin. This type is good if you want to make sure you sell Bitcoin before it falls too sharply. This type of order can take some time to execute, depending on how quickly the market moves.\n\n: an order where you specify the price at which you will buy or sell Bitcoin. This type is good if you want to make sure you sell Bitcoin before it falls too sharply. This type of order can take some time to execute, depending on how quickly the market moves. Limit order: instructs the exchange to execute a buy or sell order at a specific price or better. In contrast to stop orders, limit orders are visible to the market and can take longer to fill.\n\nAgain, executing any one of these options usually involves clicking a Buy, Trade, or New order button on an exchange's home screen. You'll then be able to choose from the above three (and more advanced) options, before clicking a Submit button or something equivalent.\n\nQuick tip: All exchanges will let you buy a fraction of a bitcoin (BTC). So while the price of 1 BTC may seem prohibitively expensive right now, you will be able to choose to buy 0.1 BTC, 0.01 BTC or whatever else you type into the exchange's interface.\n\n4. Store your crypto in a safe place\n\nWhile bigger exchanges are becoming safer, hacks and fraud remain a big problem for the industry. This is why investors with significant sums in Bitcoin are advised to consider storing their cryptocurrency themselves.\n\n\"Experienced traders that are very good with cybersecurity might prefer to own their wallets, as this gives you the ability to move your cryptocurrencies whenever you want to and not be subject to an exchange. The saying 'Not your keys, not your coins' was popular last year, as many exchanges got hacked or shut down,\" says Moya.\n\nThis means transferring your Bitcoin from the exchange you use to your own cryptocurrency wallet. Such wallets come in two forms:\n\nCold wallets: also known as hardware wallets, these are small devices that store your Bitcoin address' private key, which is necessary to transfer Bitcoin out of the address. They do not connect to the internet and are therefore considered safer than online, software-based alternatives.\n\nalso known as hardware wallets, these are small devices that store your Bitcoin address' private key, which is necessary to transfer Bitcoin out of the address. They do not connect to the internet and are therefore considered safer than online, software-based alternatives. Hot wallets: also known as software wallets, these are apps that can be used through your phone, desktop computer, or web browser. They also store the private key of your Bitcoin address, but because they do connect to the internet, they aren't considered quite as safe as hardware/cold wallets.\n\nSoftware wallets aren't quite as secure as hardware wallets, but the leading varieties do still offer a range of security features, such as two-factor authentication and compatibility with hardware wallets.\n\nSelling bitcoin\n\nWhile many traders turn to Bitcoin in the hope of making big money fast, pretty much every analyst advocates a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy. This is largely because holding for a longer period of time tends to average out gains and losses, providing a greater probability of a significant positive return by the time you sell your Bitcoin.\n\n\"In my opinion, it is better to buy and hold, perhaps allocating a small portion of your portfolio to cryptocurrencies, focusing on the ones typically held by institutional investors, such as Bitcoin at the moment,\" says Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nLikewise, many analysts also recommend adopting a dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) strategy, largely because this is another way of averaging out peaks and troughs.\n\n\"The best strategy for newcomers would be to [trade] Bitcoin on the DCA approach [...] you'll just buy a tiny bit on a monthly or weekly basis, not looking at the price movements at all,\" says Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, the CEO and founder of cryptocurrency consultancy, Eight.\n\nHowever, Moya warns that even with a long-term hold strategy, new traders are generally advised to enter the world of Bitcoin investing with the mindset that they could lose most of their money.\n\n\"A new investor should only apply a very low, single-digit percentage of their trading portfolio to cryptocurrencies. Despite the many bullish calls for Bitcoin or Ethereum, massive plunges have happened in minutes. New investors may want to consider buying and holding a basket of cryptocurrencies, with an approach of scaling into positions,\" he says.\n\nA longer-term approach is also beneficial from a tax perspective, since Bitcoin is classified as property in the US, and therefore liable to capital gains tax when sold.\n\nQuick tip: You'll have to pay capital gains tax if you sell bitcoin after holding it for more than one year. But if you hold for less than a year, your gains are taxed as ordinary income. Investors with an annual income of $40,000 or less pay no capital gains tax on Bitcoin profits, whereas those in the next bracket pay 15%.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBitcoin is an interesting and exciting technological innovation, representing a form of decentralized electronic money that doesn't require a central authority (such as the Federal Reserve) to operate. It's also exciting from an investment perspective, with its high annual returns (in most years) making it one of the best-performing assets of the past decade, even if its volatility means it has suffered more than a few dramatic falls.\n\nWhile investing in Bitcoin may seem complicated, starting off is as simple as picking a reputable exchange and setting up an account. Once you've verified your identity and deposited some money, you're then good to go, with most exchanges offering a range of order types in addition to the ability to simply buy Bitcoin.\n\nWhen you've acquired a significant sum of Bitcoin, most experts recommend withdrawing it to your own cold (i.e., hardware) wallet. They also recommend a buy-and-hold strategy, so that you can iron out market dips and also avoid having your profits taxed as ordinary income."
