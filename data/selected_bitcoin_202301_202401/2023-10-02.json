        "title": "Babylon Positions Bitcoin Beyond Store of Value, Unveiling Its Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP At Cosmoverse 2023 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Babylon introduces its Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP at Cosmoverse 2023, addressing the untapped potential of idle Bitcoins for PoS chains and dApps\n\nIstanbul, Turkey --News Direct-- Babylon\n\nBabylon, the blockchain project that aims to convert the 21 million bitcoins into a decentralized staking asset for the Proof of Stake economy, unveils its Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP at the Cosmoverse 2023. Earlier this year, Babylon published a litepaper outlining its pioneering concept of native trustless Bitcoin staking to secure PoS chains. Recent data from Glassnode\u2019s reinforces the pressing need for such an innovation. A staggering 66% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply, equivalent to 12.26 million BTC, remained dormant for a year. This indicates vast untapped potential, positioning idle Bitcoins to boost the economic security of PoS chains and decentralized applications (dApps) that rely on staking.\n\nBabylon positions itself as the first marketplace to connect the $500B decentralized trust to earn yield for providing security capital. The company was able to gain support from prominent Cosmos chains that are exploring to adopt Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin Staking Protocol. Zaki Manian, co-founder of Sommelier Protocol, said, \u201cFor years interactions between bitcoin and the growing web3 application layer have been limited to bridging and swapping. Babylon Bitcoin staking lays the path for consensus layer integration with modular and app chains\u201d.\n\nPoS chains have historically been tethered to their native assets for security. However, as the majority of capital gravitates to established protocols, emerging chains often grapple with limited staked resources, undermining their security. In addition, to attract staking, chains usually have to implement very high inflation to pay for high staking rewards, which affects its token utility and economic health. This has resulted in a fragmented ecosystem where networks are forced to compete for a limited pool of staked capital. Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin Staking Protocol provides a way for PoS chains to stake Bitcoin instead of their native tokens. This allows PoS chains to acquire staking capital from the largest crypto asset in the world and enjoy high security. In addition, since Bitcoin has been serving as a store of value without much yield, using Bitcoin as a staking asset can greatly reduce PoS chain\u2019s inflation pressure.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Babylon's protocol doesn't just harness these idle bitcoins, it transforms them into a security backbone for PoS chains,\" said David Tse, Co-founder, Babylon. \"Our approach seamlessly integrates Bitcoin staking with almost any PoS protocols in a modular fashion, allowing any bitcoin holder to earn staking rewards from a wide variety of PoS chains. This not only amplifies economic incentives but paves the way for broader adoption, underscoring Bitcoin's diverse utility beyond its widely-recognized role as a store of value.\"\n\nBabylon overcomes the limitations of Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language by amalgamating it with advanced cryptographic techniques. It allows bitcoin holders to lock their bitcoins on the Bitcoin network in a self-custodian way, yet the locked bitcoins can serve as a first-class staking asset for PoS chains with desirable properties such as yield-generation, slashability, and on-demand unstaking. In addition, Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol does not require any soft or hard fork of Bitcoin.\n\nScreenshot of Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP\n\nScreenshot of Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP\n\nBabylon MVP showcases the first implementation of this new technology, where bitcoin testnet coins are staked to secure Babylon PoS chain, which will serve as the control plane for other PoS chains to access to the Bitcoin staking protocol. The MVP comes with a modern explorer and a very straightforward web application for bitcoin holders to test Bitcoin staking.\n\nAfter the MVP debut, Babylon will focus on adoption in various ecosystems. This includes the Cosmos ecosystem of blockchains, which is heavily reliant on native staking. Within Cosmos, the top ten protocols boast a combined $2.5 billion worth of staked assets, with an average staking ratio of 50%. Furthermore, 34 integrated PoS chains have shown a strong desire to reduce the 21 day unbonding time for assets staked in Cosmos. Demand for Babylon\u2019s time-stamping protocol was made clear when the Osmosis governance proposal to utilize Bitcoin staking was passed with a 99.9% vote in favor.\n\nThe Company successfully secured a seed funding round, spearheaded by IDG and Breyer Capital\u2014prominent early backers of Coinbase and Circle. With this momentum, the firm is actively seeking additional investment to bolster the advancement of the Bitcoin Staking protocol, among other initiatives.\n\nAbout Babylon\n\nBabylon is a blockchain project that designs security protocols for the decentralized world. Babylon\u2019s origins come from a transformative research paper on Bitcoin security co-authored by Babylon co-founders David Tse, a professor at Stanford, Fisher Yu, Sreeram Kannan, the founder of EigenLayer, and co-authors. This Bitcoin security research paper achieved a significant milestone as it has been accepted by the 2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, recognized as the world's leading security conference. The project is led by a team of consensus protocol researchers from Stanford and experienced layer 1 engineers from around the world.\n\nBabylon's mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world. To achieve this, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: Bitcoin as an asset, its reliable timestamping service, its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world. To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol. Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.\n\nBitcoin Staking Protocol MVP: https://btcstakingscan.devnet.babylonchain.io/\n\nContact Details\n\nBabylon\n\nShalini Wood, CMO\n\nswood@babylonchain.io\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/babylon-positions-bitcoin-beyond-store-of-value-unveiling-its-bitcoin-staking-protocol-mvp-at-cosmoverse-2023-586215540"

        "content": "FTX's multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency blowup hasn't destroyed all faith in the industry. In a new documentary premiering Monday, FTX customers, insiders and investors tell CNBC that despite not receiving a single dollar's worth of cryptocurrency back, they're optimistic on the industry and plan to keep investing. Evan Luthra, an app developer, entrepreneur and angel investor, told CNBC he lost $2 million in the collapse of FTX. Luthra said he knew when FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2022 that he wouldn't have \"access to any of this money for the next few years.\" He continues to speak at crypto conferences.\n\nFTX customer Evan Luthra talked with CNBC in Miami before speaking at a crypto conference. CNBC\n\n\"I do want everybody to understand that the mistake here was not bitcoin , the mistake was not crypto,\" Luthra said. \"The fundamental reason why we buy bitcoin, why we use bitcoin has not changed.\" Luthra said his hefty loss on FTX hasn't shaken his bitcoin bullishness. \"I know it's going to end up at over $100,000 sooner or later anyways, so for me it's a great buy,\" he said. Bitcoin is currently trading at about $26,900, down from a high of about $69,000 in December 2021. \"All the success is made in the trenches, not when everybody's already celebrating,\" he said. FTX, once one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, spiraled into bankruptcy after its swift collapse last year. Shortly afterward, FTX investigators said they discovered $8.9 billion in customer assets were missing from the exchange. FTX founder and ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried faces seven criminal charges of fraud and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. Jury selection begins in New York on Tuesday.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves Manhattan federal court in New York after a court appearance, June 15, 2023. Fatih Aktas | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nAt a bankruptcy hearing in April 2022, an attorney for FTX said $7.3 billion in cash and liquid crypto assets had been recovered from the exchange. So far, none of the customers interviewed by CNBC have received any of their money back. Jake Thacker, an FTX customer in Portland, Oregon, told CNBC he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the exchange shortly after he lost his job in the tech industry. \"I'm in quite a big hole right now,\" Thacker said. \"I'm probably going to have to file for bankruptcy.\"\n\nFTX customer Jake Thacker told CNBC he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the crypto exchange. CNBC\n\nThacker told CNBC he \"would encourage people to still invest in crypto.\" \"I probably would give them some different advice at this point,\" he said. That advice would come with the warning: \"Here's what I learned, don't make the same mistakes I did.\" Bhagamshi Kannegundla said he first heard about FTX in an advertisement featuring comedian Larry David that aired during the Super Bowl. \"I was like, oh my goodness, there's all these big name people utilizing FTX,\" Kannegundla said. \"So I was like, OK, hey, I think I'll be safe using this.\" Less than a year later, Kannegundla said, he was out $174,000, representing around 60% of his crypto portfolio, from FTX's collapse.\n\nBhagamshi Kannegundla, an FTX customer, told CNBC he sold his bankruptcy claim to reinvest in crypto. CNBC\n\n\"Based on all the other bankruptcies and everything that happened in the crypto market, I was really, really worried about getting anything back, and then how long I would have to wait,\" Kannegundla said. Instead of waiting for the recoveries to eventually be distributed to FTX customers, Kannegundla went online and found a company that would help him sell his bankruptcy claim for pennies on the dollar to get a little bit of cash more quickly. Kannegundla said his bankruptcy claim was for $174,000. He received around $19,000 in the sale. \"The buyer was, after all the due diligence and everything, it went down to like 11% of the $174,000,\" he said. Years later, if the FTX bankruptcy process recovers more than the 11 cents on the dollar for his claim, the buyer pockets the difference. Kannegundla said he will have \"zero regrets\" if that money gets recovered because he has a different strategy. \"I wanted to get the cash from the bankruptcy claim, primarily to invest in crypto again,\" he said. \"I felt as if there was a good chance for me to make money in the next five to 10 years.\" Kannegundla said he understands that it may be an odd choice. \"People might think I'm crazy for this,\" he said. \"After going through the FTX and all these other bankruptcies, why would you want to buy any more crypto?\" \"When you believe in something as far as technology, you will go through it, you know, it's kind of like the same person who bought like, let's say Amazon stock,\" he said. Another FTX customer, Sunil Kavuri, who has a background in traditional finance, said he moved his digital assets from rival exchange Binance to FTX because he believed it was a safe place for his money. He pointed to the fact that the company raised money from top venture capital firms Sequoia and Paradigm. \"I thought OK, this is a very safe, institutionally backed exchange,\" he said.\n\nBahamas-based crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Nov. 11, 2022. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nIn an email to CNBC, Kavuri said he hasn't purchased any crypto since the collapse of FTX because he \"wanted to take a break from suffering a massive loss.\" Over the last 10 months, he said, the majority of his time has been spent fighting \"for the rights of all FTX users that lost money due to the FTX bankruptcy.\" \"It hasn't shaken my faith in the underlying asset itself,\" Kavuri said. \"I think cryptocurrencies generally, it should be here to stay.\"\n\nFTX customer Sunil Kavuri told CNBC his loss on the exchange hasn't shaken his faith in the underlying asset. CNBC\n\nAcross the industry, crypto still has its believers despite the madness of 2022. Brett Harrison, the former president of FTX's U.S. business, said he was blindsided by his parent company's collapse. But he's doubling down on cryptocurrencies. Harrison, who left FTX less than two months before its demise, told CNBC he \"had no reason to suspect that FTX wasn't anything other than extremely profitable and in great shape\" prior to his departure.\n\nBrett Harrison, former president of FTX US, left the company less than two months before its collapse. CNBC\n\nHarrison said he's been raising money to start a new company in the space called Architect Financial Technologies. \"I'd really like to build a technology and a tech-forward brokerage that allows people to trade seamlessly and easily in digital assets and any kind of other tokenized products in addition to other asset classes,\" Harrison said. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge Capital, said he felt like he was late to the game. He didn't make his first bitcoin investment until October 2020. He later started Skybridge to focus on digital assets.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the founder of Skybridge Capital, spoke with CNBC at his office in New York. CNBC"
