        "content": "Bitcoin has broken $21,000.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko data, BTC was valued at $21,083 at 12:59 a.m. UTC on Jan. 14. Its market cap was $403 billion. That change represents a 12% increase in 24 hours.\n\nData also shows that $245 million of shorts have been liquidated over the past 24 hours, while $255 million of Bitcoin was bought on spot markets today.\n\nThere are no major events that could have had an obvious positive effect on investor activity. Rather, changing investor sentiment may be due to a lack of bad news \u2014 and due to the fact that major crises like FTX\u2019s collapse are fading into the past.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s gains today represent ongoing growth over the past several days. This week, positive anticipation and sentiment toward a Consumer Price Index (CPI) announcement appeared to contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s price growth.\n\nThe round number of $20,000 also represents a psychological barrier, and as such, investors may be optimistic now that Bitcoin has crossed it.\n\nBitcoin typically leads the crypto market, and its performance today contributed to the crypto market\u2019s overall growth. The entire crypto market cap was up 8% over the past 24 hours, and it now has a market cap of $1.02 trillion.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and the entire crypto market outperformed the stock market today. The Dow Jones was up 0.3% today, while the S&P 500 was up 0.4%.\n\nHowever, some altcoins have seen modest growth compared to Bitcoin. Ethereum was up 9.8%, while XRP, BNB, and Polygon each gained close to 6%. It remains to be seen whether the crypto market will continue to trend upward."

        "content": "Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of American business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, has shared what he thinks will happen to bitcoin (BTC) in the next eight years while outlining how it will come into play.\n\nIn a recent interview with Cory Klippsten, the founder and CEO of Swan Bitcoin, Saylor noted that he sees bitcoin becoming a global store of value by 2031.\n\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nAccording to him, institutional adoption is one of the first drivers of the digital asset\u2019s global store of value status in the coming years. The bitcoin proponent believes institutional adoption is possible through the \u201cutterances\u201d of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and decisions by traditional financial institutions.\n\nSaylor mentioned some traditional financial institutions, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, that are beginning to embrace bitcoin in recent times due to its potential despite previously distancing themselves from the asset.\n\nThe Explosion of Lightning Network\n\nThe MicroStrategy co-founder also cited the explosive growth of the Lightning Network as another factor that will make the digital asset a global store of value.\n\nThe Lightning Network is a layer-2 solution built on the bitcoin protocol to make transactions faster and cheaper. Interestingly, MicroStrategy plans to develop applications powered by the Lightning Network that could reach millions of users.\n\nAccording to Saylor, developing \u201ckiller apps\u201d like Lightning Wallets that move digital dollars and BTC and swaps in and out of local currency will create massive demand for the asset.\n\n\u201cI just describe this as in 1991, you had TCP IP, and we had the internet, but not many people used it. In 1994, you had the Netscape browser, and now that was the killer app for the internet, and pretty soon you had 100 million people download that browser and it caught fire,\u201d he said.\n\nMacroeconomic Headwinds\n\nThe billionaire also noted that macroeconomic headwinds, such as the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes, are major factors that will help bitcoin achieve a global store of value status.\n\nTo tame inflation, the Fed raised the federal funds rate seven times in 2022, with more expected to happen this year. Saylor stated that inflation would increase once the Fed reduces its interest rate hikes which will be a marketing driver for the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the MicroStrategy executive chairman, the combination of these factors will \u201cplay out against the new reality: bitcoin is the only digital commodity, it is the only crypto asset, and there is no second best crypto asset.\u201d"

        "content": "For the first time since early November, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry exceeded $1 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nOn January 14, Bitcoin increased to over $21,000 on hopes that inflation may have peaked and reached a bottom. The biggest cryptocurrency increased up to 7.5% to $21,299 in value. Since November 8 it hadn't been above $20,000, and January 14 was its 11th straight day of growth. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, rose up to 9.7%, and other coins like Cardano and Dogecoin also registered significant gains.\n\nBefore this most recent breakout, the price of Bitcoin had been trapped in a small range between $16,000 and $17,000 for weeks. The rising movements have surprised shorts; according to statistics from Coinglass, cryptocurrency short liquidations have exceeded $100 million in five of the last six days. The biggest amount was reached on January 14 and exceeded $296 million.\n\nThe increases coincided with consumer pricing data released last week that indicated a decline in inflation from December levels to January levels. Following that additional cooling, the Federal Reserve is on course to transition to smaller interest-rate rises, but it's expected to keep doing so until price pressures show more certain indications of moderating. Risky assets, such as the Nasdaq 100 stock index, which has increased for six days in a row, have benefited from this.\n\nFollowing the soft CPI print, cryptoassets fared nicely, indicating that the correlation between crypto and macro is not about to disappear any time soon, as per Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat. The price action that has continued this week is undoubtedly positive, and barring any forced liquidations by the financially challenged crypto business DCG, there is a strong likelihood that the absolute bottom has been reached for cryptocurrency pricing.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment, which is still gloomy, has been overshadowed by the declining CPI and the news that the FTX liquidators had recovered $5 billion in cash assets, as per Hayden Hughes, chief executive officer of social-trading platform Alpha Impact. Going into the upcoming FOMC meeting later this month, the markets are moving strongly in the right direction, he added.\n\n(With Bloomberg inputs)\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Jumped Over 10% in the Last 24 Hours - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThe cryptocurrency market suddenly came to life on Friday night for the first time since FTX collapsed in early November. Nearly every asset was up big, and some with ties to FTX are significantly higher.\n\nBitcoin (BTC 2.53%) jumped 10.9% and is trading at $20,909 at 8 a.m. ET, surpassing the $20,000 level for the first time since FTX became insolvent in early November. Ethereum (ETH 1.92%) is up 10.1% in the last day to $1,540 and Solana (SOL 1.36%) is the big mover, popping 36.1% to $22.53. Over the past week, the cryptocurrencies are up 23.2%, 21.5%, and 69.9%, respectively.\n\nSo what\n\nMomentum can be a powerful force in cryptocurrencies, especially on the weekend. Trading on weekends often leads to some of the biggest moves, as traders take time off and there's less liquidity (buyers and sellers) in the market.\n\nFueling some of the moves is liquidations of short positions. According to coinglass.com, $730 million of short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours with $240 million of that being in Bitcoin, $261 million in Ethereum, and $26.3 million of Solana short trades.\n\nThe two macro news items this week were inflation data that showed a reduction in prices over the past month, leading to speculation the Federal Reserve will soon stop raising rates and may even be forced to lower rates sooner than expected. This pushed growth stocks and high-risk assets higher this week, but the momentum really hit crypto hard on Friday evening into Saturday morning.\n\nSince FTX got us here, it may in part be FTX that has driven the rally. By that, I mean that liquidators of FTX's assets have recovered $5 billion in assets to return to customers and they've been selling leveraged positions as quickly as possible. That added selling pressure to a market with lower liquidity, and when added to the short positions this can drop prices. But when they slow selling and short positions get liquidated (as they have today), the bounce higher can be swift.\n\nNow what\n\nThe price of cryptocurrencies fundamentally comes down to supply and demand. Supply isn't rising very quickly, so demand is the key. When FTX collapsed and the crypto winter wore on, many investors and traders either gave up on the market or took short positions to take advantage of weakness. But over time there should be more and more users of the blockchain, helped lately by significant corporate interest.\n\nI think the long-term trend for cryptocurrencies is still higher, but the volatility seen over the last two months will continue. There needs to be more use cases that disrupt old businesses or create new businesses, and that's when mass adoption will come. That's why Solana is my top cryptocurrency long term, given its low costs and high speed. But a rising tide lifts all boats, and bullishness on crypto overall is helping everything trade higher today."

        "content": "Bitcoin surged over $21,000 on Saturday amid optimism that it may have bottomed and inflation has peaked.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 7.5% to $21,299, before paring gains as the day progressed. It hadn\u2019t been above $20,000 since Nov. 8, and Saturday was the 11th straight day of advances. Second-largest token Ether surged as much as 9.7%, and others such as Cardano and Dogecoin also notched gains. Solana soared as much as 35%.\n\nThe overall market cap of the crypto universe rose above $1 trillion for the first time since early November, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cThere has been a steady grind higher since the start of the year,\u201d said Cici Lu, chief executive officer of Venn Link Partners Pte. \u201cIt feels like we hit a supply \u2018air pocket\u2019 and breaking through $20,000 resistance took out some stops. Optically, $20,000 for many is a key level.\u201d\n\nUS short-term inflation expectations fell in early January to the lowest in nearly two years, providing a bigger-than-expected boost to consumer sentiment, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary survey reading. A separate report showed consumer prices rising 6.5% in the 12 months through December, marking the slowest inflation rate in more than a year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is on track to downshift to smaller interest-rate increases following the further cooling in prices, though it\u2019s likely to keep hiking until pressures show more definitive signs of slowing. That\u2019s helped boost risk assets like the Nasdaq 100 stock index, which has gained for six straight days.\n\n\u201cCryptoassets performed well following the soft CPI print, suggesting that crypto\u2019s correlation to macro is not going away anytime soon,\u201d said Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat. \u201cThis week\u2019s follow-through in price action is certainly encouraging,\u201d and barring any forced liquidations from troubled crypto company DCG, \u201cthere is a high probability that the absolute bottom is in for crypto prices.\u201d\n\nThe price of Bitcoin was stuck in a narrow range around $16,000 to $17,000 for weeks before the latest breakout. The upward moves have caught shorts by surprise \u2014 crypto short liquidations have topped $100 million in five of the past six days, according to data from Coinglass. Saturday\u2019s total was the highest, topping $449 million.\n\nKatie Stockton, co-founder of Fairlead Strategies, offered a caution about the rally, which has taken Bitcoin above its 200-day moving average for the first time in a year.\n\n\u201cDeeply overbought short-term readings challenge positive momentum, so we would not chase the rally at these levels,\u201d she said in a note Friday. She sees resistance near $21,500, where there\u2019s a 61% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nStill, the upward trajectory could inject even further optimism into a market that\u2019s been struggling to find good news in recent months.\n\n\u201cDeclining CPI coupled with the announcement that the FTX liquidators have recovered $5 billion in liquid assets have given crypto markets plenty of factors to forget the macro picture, which is still bearish,\u201d said Hayden Hughes, chief executive officer of social-trading platform Alpha Impact. \u201cMarkets have plenty of positive momentum heading into the next FOMC meeting later this month.\u201d"
