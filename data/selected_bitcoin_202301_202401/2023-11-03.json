        "content": "00:00\n\nBitcoin. Hands down. Hands down. Bitcoin is a hedge against both inflation and deflation. Yes, so is gold. But bitcoin is digital. And if you look at the incremental demand we're going to see. But gold already has its demand. You know it's happened, right? Bitcoin is new and institutions are barely involved. And young people would much prefer to hold Bitcoin than to hold gold. So, you know, it's interesting that both gold and Bitcoin are hedges against deflation, but Bitcoin has been doing better recently."

        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) volatility has been dealing a heavy blow to crypto markets. Miller Value Partners Portfolio Manager Bill Miller IV joins Yahoo Finance Live to shed more light on bitcoin's trading resiliency despite various crypto headwinds.\n\n\"Bitcoin is very different from crypto, crypto was convicted yesterday,\" Miller states, referencing former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's fraud conviction. \"Bitcoin is going very very strong, the network is as strong as it's ever been.\"\n\nMiller anticipates positive long-term trends for bitcoin despite its recent volatility, citing it's appeal as an \"uncensorable\" asset.\n\nClick here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Volatility in the cryptocurrency is putting a dent in the exchanges that hold it. Coinbase saw trading volumes sink in its third quarter amid volatile trading sessions for the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy had to write down more than $33 million in its most recent quarter, thanks to the falling coin price since its November 2021 peak.\n\nOur next guest has remained a Bitcoin bull despite the fluctuating price and scandals in the crypto sector, like Sam Bankman-Fried's recent fraud conviction. Let's bring in Bill Miller IV, Miller Value Partners Portfolio Manager.\n\nBill, good to talk to you today. Let me get your reaction, first of all, to the verdict that was handed down. What this, ultimately, means for crypto as a whole?\n\nBILL MILLER: Well, I think it's really important that we differentiate between Bitcoin and crypto. So crypto was convicted yesterday on seven counts of fraud. Lying to people about what you're doing with their money is wrong.\n\nThe beauty of Bitcoin is that's not an issue. There is a very clear digital ledger maintained by computers and a very clear protocol out there that's visible for everyone to see. Bitcoin is very different from crypto.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo crypto was convicted yesterday. Bitcoin is still going very, very strong. The networks are strong as it's ever been. There's more users than there's ever been. So we continue to see very positive trends in Bitcoin, not so much in crypto.\n\nBRAD SMITH: What is the most positive trend? And do you believe that it's largely-- especially with some of the price action that we've seen recently that seems to have been driven, not so much by what's taking place in trials, but more so by some of the ETFs that could be set for approval?\n\nBILL MILLER: Yeah. I think the big picture trend is that Bitcoin is the best performing asset in nine of the past 12 years. It's been up three out of four years. People tend to focus on the very short-term fluctuations and the volatility. But the reality is, there's a real demand globally for an uncensorable asset, where the regulators can't change the rules and the measuring stick over time.\n\nSo I think another thing that's driven Bitcoin's appreciation recently is the massive debts we're racking up in the US. Deficits are going up. Debts are going up. And someone's going to have to pay for that. Ultimately, it's going to come from money printing."

        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were trading relatively flat during Friday\u2019s trading session on lower-than-average volume despite the general market surging following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision Wednesday to hold interest rates steady.\n\nThe three popular cryptos have been consolidating since Oct. 24, after Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin surged on hopes the Security and Exchange Commission is close to approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, the cryptos have been consolidating near highly important technical levels, with Bitcoin trading under strong resistance at the $36,000 mark and Ethereum and Dogecoin moving horizontally above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).\n\nThe 200-day SMA is an important bellwether. Technical traders and investors consider a stock trading above the level on the daily chart to be in a bull cycle, whereas a stock trading under the 200-day SMA is considered to be in a bear cycle.\n\nThe 50-day SMA also plays an important role in technical analysis, especially when paired with the 200-day. When the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA, a death cross occurs whereas when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, a bullish golden cross takes place.\n\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin has been consolidating sideways on lower-than-average volume, while rejecting the important $36,000 mark on each attempt. The consolidation has been taking place on declining volume, which is often followed by a burst in high volume.\n\nThe sideways consolidation is helping to lower Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), which has been trading above the 70% level since Oct. 19. When a stock\u2019s or crypto\u2019s RSI is above 70%, it\u2019s considered to be overbought, which can be a sell signal for technical traders.\n\nBullish traders want to see Bitcoin\u2019s RSI continue to lower and then for big bearish volume to come in and break the crypto up through $36,000, which could accelerate a move to the upside toward $40,000. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and break Bitcoin down below the eight-day exponential moving average, which would negate the crypto\u2019s current uptrend.\n\nIt should be noted that a golden cross, which occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, formed on Bitcoin\u2019s chart on Oct. 29, which suggests the crypto is in a strong bull cycle.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $35,593 and at $38,105 and support below at $31,862 and at $31,418.\n\nThe Ethereum and Dogecoin Charts: Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating sideways near the 200-day SMA, with Ethereum trading sideways above that area and Dogecoin under it. Both Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating near the 200-day on decreasing volume, which like Bitcoin, indicates a larger move in one direction is on the horizon.\n\nWhile Ethereum is trading in an uptrend within its consolidating pattern, Dogecoin is trading in a tightening range, forming a triangle formation. If the cryptos break bullishly from their respective patterns, a more powerful move to the upside could be in the cards.\n\nBearish traders want to see Ethereum break down under the 200-day SMA and for Dogecoin to break down from the lower ascending trendline of the triangle. If either of those two things happens, downside pressure is likely to accelerate.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,825 and at $1,937 and support below at $1,717 and at $1,615.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.069 and at $0.075 and support below at $0.065 and at $0.061.\n\nRead Next: Jack Dorsey's Block And Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy Are Both Big On Bitcoin \u2014 But Here's The Real Winner - MicroStrategy\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "A Deep Dive Into Bitcoin Forks And Alternatives For 2023 - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrency has witnessed significant growth and innovation in recent years. Bitcoin, the pioneering digital asset, has led the way in revolutionizing financial market concepts. As the value of Bitcoin continues to rise, investors are keeping a close eye on its potential for future growth. However, with the emergence of Bitcoin forks and alternative cryptocurrencies, there are now additional opportunities for investors to explore. In this article, we will delve deep into the world of Bitcoin forks and alternatives, analyzing their features, benefits, and potential for success in 2023.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Forks\n\nBitcoin forks are created when developers make changes to the original Bitcoin code, resulting in the creation of a new cryptocurrency. These forks can be categorized into two types: hard forks and soft forks. Hard forks involve significant changes to the protocol, resulting in the creation of a new blockchain. Soft forks, on the other hand, involve minor changes that are backward compatible with the original blockchain.\n\nPopular Bitcoin Forks Bitcoin XT\n\nOne of the earliest Bitcoin forks was Bitcoin XT, created in 2014. Bitcoin XT aimed to increase the number of transactions per second by increasing the block size. However, the project faced challenges and eventually lost momentum.\n\nBitcoin Classic\n\nFollowing the failure of Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic emerged in 2016. The developers of Bitcoin Classic focused on increasing the block size to improve scalability. While the project initially gained support, it has since seen a decline in popularity.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited\n\nBitcoin Unlimited, launched in 2016, offered an alternative approach to scaling Bitcoin. The project allowed miners to determine the block size, providing more flexibility in the network. However, Bitcoin Unlimited has not gained significant traction and remains a lesser-known fork.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash, created in 2017, is one of the most well-known Bitcoin forks. It aimed to address the scalability issues of Bitcoin by increasing the block size to 8MB. Bitcoin Cash has gained a substantial following and has become a popular alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Gold\n\nBitcoin Gold, launched in 2017, focused on making mining more accessible to individual miners. The project aimed to bring back the use of GPUs instead of specialized mining hardware. While Bitcoin Gold has not achieved the same level of success as Bitcoin Cash, it remains an interesting alternative in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe Rise of Bitcoin Alternatives\n\nWhile Bitcoin forks have gained attention, there are also numerous alternative cryptocurrencies that offer unique features and benefits. These alternatives seek to address various issues faced by Bitcoin, such as scalability, transaction speed, and decentralization.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is another leading digital currency that has made significant advancements in the blockchain space. Ethereum offers a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, expanding on the initial Bitcoin concept and giving additional use to its cryptocurrency. The smart contract feature allows the blockchain to be a bed for developers to flourish with their own token-based products.\n\nBitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark builds on both Bitcoin and Ethereum as an alternative that utilizes a unique Proof-of-Process (PoP) mechanism. This mechanism combines Proof-of-Work (PoW), originally introduced by Bitcoin, and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), to which Ethereum has recently changed to improve mining decentralization and transaction speed. Bitcoin Spark allows anyone with a smartphone to participate in the mining process, democratizing the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe Potential of Bitcoin Forks and Alternatives\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to rise in value, many investors are looking for alternative investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin forks and alternatives offer unique features and benefits that may appeal to different investors. The Bitcoin Spark ICO is the next step on this journey to profitable Bitcoin alternatives, with many investors already grabbing large allocations.\n\nPredicting the future of Bitcoin forks and alternatives is challenging due to the volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. However, with the increasing interest from institutional investors and the potential for market-wide adoption, there is a possibility of significant growth and development in this space. Investors should conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions.\n\nThere is no doubt that making the next leap in technology will bring about huge interest, and what Bitcoin Spark brings to the table with its Proof-Of-Process technology that allows revenue to be generated on top of the blockchain will certainly pull many in the industry towards it.\n\nIf Bitcoin Spark works in the same way many of the previous Bitcoin alternatives have, it may be interesting to see how it unfolds.\n\nLearn more about Bitcoin Spark here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

        "title": "MicroStrategy's Saylor on Bankman-Fried, Bitcoin ETF - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nA verdict in the Sam Bankman-fried case. Being found guilty on seven counts of fraud. We'd love to hear your reaction to that ruling and what it potentially means for the crypto industry going forward. I think that it's an important milestone in the growth and the maturation of the industry. The crypto industry has been plagued by inexperienced entrepreneurs like Sam, unreliable custodians like RTX incompetent creditors. A dozen went bankrupt in the last year or two. Unscrupulous promoters and their failure is a necessary rite of passage for an industry that's going to lead to a new, more stable, more scalable ecosystem that will be based on Bitcoin. Public companies like BLOCK MicroStrategy Marathon, a dozen Bitcoin miners that are public institutional money managers like Fidelity and BlackRock and regulated banks when they eventually become custodians. The offshore crypto exchanges, the stablecoins, the crypto tokens, the defi projects they're going to shrink, fade into the background and decouple from mainstream and institutional digital assets marketplace that will be based on Bitcoin. And Michael, you bring up BlackRock, you bring up Fidelity, and of course both of those firms have applications in for a spot U.S. Bitcoin ETF, something that hasn't been approved yet. But there's a lot of speculation, a lot of optimism that it could be soon. What would that mean for MicroStrategy, given that? I mean, you've been on the record to saying that MicroStrategy shares are a proxy for Bitcoin. If you're able to get that through a physically backed ETF, would that lessen the premium that MicroStrategy enjoys? I think it's critical for there to be a spot ETF for mainstream retail investors and mainstream institutional investors to participate. So it's going to lay a base layer that's going to allow large amounts of capital to flow into the industry. MicroStrategy is a special investment vehicle for Bitcoin. Long balls were different from an ETF because we don't charge a fee. We can use intelligent leverage. We borrowed 2.2 billion at 1.6% interest to buy Bitcoin, and we can generate a tax deferred bitcoin premium either by using cash purchased by cash purchases or by capital markets activity. So we're not for everybody. And in sovereign wealth funds that want to buy $50 billion worth of Bitcoin can't fit into the MicroStrategy capital structure. But if you want leverage and this tax deferred yield and no fee, then we're an interesting alternative for people in the space with regards to building up that position, that that crypto position even further than what you have. Does the introduction of those ETFs, would that create competition to increase ASICs asset class asset sizes? Excuse me? I think it's going to help everybody in the space. They're going to accelerate education efforts and adoption. And already you can see fidelity analysts are making a huge impact on the digital asset space. So as you see Wall Street analysts from all these ETF firms and you see their education and marketing efforts come into the space and as they provide the rails for traditional institutional investors and endowments and the like to engage, they're going to expand their entire ecosystem, but they're not an operating company. They can't take on leverage. They can't not charge a fee. I mean, we literally don't charge a fee and they can't they can't engage in cash purchases with operating income like we can in order to generate that tax deferred Bitcoin premium. It's interesting to to see some of the moves in Bitcoin this year. Obviously, the volatility is still there, but not necessarily to the extremes that we saw in prior years. And I'm wondering if the introduction or the broadening out of the user base will reintroduce that volatility or have we kind of moved past that? Are we kind of in a different era now? Well, I think we've reached a nice point. But, you know, when Bitcoin plus past $100000 to $200000, maybe it'll trade from 250,000 down to 175,000. And people are going to be screaming the end again. So Bitcoin is is compounding at 40 to 50% annualized growth rate for the past three and a quarter years since MicroStrategy got into the space with a lot of volatility. I think an analyst, Timmer from Fidelity pointed out it is got the highest volatility of any asset, but it's also got the greatest return. And so as I've said in the past, volatility has vitality. I'd rather have the volatility and the performance than get rid of the volatility. Gold's not volatile, but it's also down 1% in three and a quarter years. So that's not what we're looking for. Michael, I want to talk a little bit more about the user base of crypto who's actually buying, because, of course, if you take a look at the trading market, you've seen trading volume absolutely fall off a clip. And the narrative I keep hearing is that you've had all these retail players flushed out after what we saw with FTC's a year ago. So maybe a spot Bitcoin ETF is in the offing, but do you think that that would actually bring back in those marginal buyers, those retail players, or have they been burned too badly? Yeah, I think that during this crypto meltdown, the crypto pros offshore and the leveraged hedge funds, they exited the space. They were all bankrupted for the most part. Right now the natural buyers in the space are Bitcoin Hodlers the maximalists the people that are sweeping their incremental cash flows into bitcoin. It's it's almost impossible, very difficult for mainstream investors and mainstream retail to buy Bitcoin because there are just very few on ramps. So the natural sellers are the miners, the natural buyers of the hodlers, the trading volume has diminished quite a bit. This is the long before the storm. Once we get these ETFs in place, that will open up the gateway for mainstream retail and mainstream institutional capital to flow. And the halving in April is going to cut the available supply in half, and it's going to eliminate half of the natural selling. So this next four month period is very pivotal to the asset class. I want to talk to you about your own Bitcoin holdings, and I have a very detailed question for you. I have to give credit to Tom Trillionowe in our newsroom for this. If you take a look at page 21 of the latest 10-Q, it mentions that MicroStrategy could raise just over $600 million in an ATM equity offering. Is that something you're thinking about tapping? You take a look at the shares. Right now, they're up over 200% year to date. Could you use that to add more to your Bitcoin funds here? We have raised more than $1,000,000,000 in the past via ATM offerings, and whenever we did it, it was accretive to our shareholders. This $600 million vehicle will allow us to engage in more capital markets activity. You know, as we're selling stock at a premium and then buying the underlying Bitcoin, we're capturing a tax deferred Bitcoin premium for our common stock shareholders. So we're very thoughtful about when we do that and how we do that. And sometimes we'll do it, sometimes we want it depends on market conditions and, you know, and where everything trades."
