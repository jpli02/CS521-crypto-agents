        "content": "Bitcoin miners have tumbled since last Thursday, following the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds . However, for some mining stocks, any weakness in the coming weeks is an opportunity, according to Bernstein. The declines are in part due to the pullback in the bitcoin price, which is down roughly 6% in the same period. In a Monday note to investors, Bernstein also pointed to lower investor appetite for mining stocks as a bitcoin proxy now that ETFs have entered the market. However, Gautam Chhugani, lead crypto analyst at Bernstein, said the firm is still optimistic on high-quality miners, calling out Riot Platforms and CleanSpark . \"We feel confident about inflection in miner cashflows for the best-in-class miners that are consolidating capacity and seeing strong traction in revenues from higher bitcoin price and transaction fees,\" he said. \"Thus, miners would continue to offer higher beta trade to the next bitcoin inflection \u2014 in our view, post halving.\" RIOT YTD mountain Riot Platforms is down 25% this year Since spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S. last week, Riot and CleanSpark have each declined more than 20%. Marathon Digital has declined nearly 30%. Iris Energy and Cipher Mining are each lower more than 21%. The bitcoin halving \u2014 the event in which the reward for mining the cryptocurrency is cut in half \u2014 is approaching in the spring of this year. The halving also eats into bitcoin miners' revenues. Investors are watching the price of bitcoin, which was expected by some to rally after the Securities and Exchange Commission's decision to allow spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., but instead played out as a sell-the-news event. If bitcoin doesn't rise to the $50,000 to $55,000 range, less efficient, higher-cost miners may not have sufficient capital to grow and may have difficulty maintaining their operations. \"Just like bitcoin, the next two months offer dip buying opportunity in bitcoin miners,\" Chhugani said. \"To be cautious during [the] halving, some higher cost miners may struggle if bitcoin price remains flattish from here \u2014 hence, best to be exposed to low cost miners.\" Bitcoin miners were top performers in 2023, outperforming even bitcoin. Riot and CleanSpark gained 356% and 440%, respectively. Marathon swelled by 586%. Flagship crypto bitcoin finished up 157%."

        "content": "Bitcoin has become a hot topic again for investors. Last week\u2019s stamp of approval from the SEC for a slew of spot Bitcoin ETFs was one of the most widely anticipated events in the history of cryptocurrency. It brought with it a great deal of volatility. Some viewed it as a \u201cSell the news\u201d event with speculators pumping prices up ahead of the news.\n\nThe initial movement following that first morning has been to the downside. Bitcoin prices are off from nearly $49,000 to $43,000 intraday on January 16th, 2024. The selling has not been isolated to the underlying cryptocurrency. The selling also hit the Bitcoin miners pretty hard.\n\nHere in today\u2019s Chart of the Day, we delve into the world of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin miners including Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI).\n\nIn his video, Bartosiak employs technical analysis techniques to break down Marathon Digital\u2019s recent price movements. Here's a glimpse of how he dissects the chart:\n\nMoving Averages: Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.\n\nSupport and Resistance Levels: Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.\n\nChart Patterns: He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.\n\nTechnical Indicators: Bartosiak also utilizes technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to gauge the stock's momentum and potential reversal points.\n\nVolume Analysis: He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.\n\nStory continues\n\nDave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding of Marathon Digital's stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "New bitcoin ETFs are a 'key milestone,' says investing expert\u2014what they mean for your money - CNBC",
        "content": "As of Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission has approved a batch of 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds for trading in the U.S. Cryptocurrency investors had been eagerly awaiting this moment. In anticipation of the ruling, traders bid up the price of bitcoin 155% in calendar year 2023, to more than $42,000. On the first day of trading, $4.6 billion worth of shares of the new ETFs changed hands, according to investing research firm CFRA. \"This is a key milestone in the ETF industry,\" says Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFI. \"For a generation of investors who have been embracing ETFs as their go-to investment vehicle, this opens the door for them to get exposure to this emerging asset class.\" In other words, these funds are a big deal. Here's why, and what you should know about them.\n\nBitcoin ETFs aren't new, but these are different\n\nIf you thought you'd seen a bitcoin ETF before Thursday's announcement, you're right \u2014 kind of. The previous generation of ETFs were designed to track the price of bitcoin by holding bitcoin derivatives. In general, the managers of these ETFs continuously bought and sold bitcoin futures contracts to try to replicate movements in bitcoin's value. This imperfect process often resulted in investment returns that didn't accurately track fluctuations in bitcoin's price. \"It was a broken product that never really worked,\" says Stephane Ouellette, founder and CEO of FRNT Financial. \"Buying bitcoin products in most retail accounts was very difficult.\" The new slate of ETFs clears up that problem. So-called spot ETFs track the price of bitcoin by actually owning bitcoin. \"It's perhaps a cleaner way of getting exposure to the asset,\" Rosenbluth says.\n\nETFs are a convenient way to get crypto exposure\n\nUnlike many popular ETFs, which track the performance of a diverse array of investments, the new bitcoin funds track one thing: the price of bitcoin. Which raises the question: Why not just own bitcoin? The answer, for many retail investors, will be convenience. Bitcoin ETFs can be purchased directly through your brokerage account and can live on your portfolio dashboard right next to all of your other investments. \"The investor that's likely to find this appealing is the one who has already bought other ETFs, whether it's tied to the S&P 500 or emerging markets or bonds or what have you,\" says Rosenbluth. \"This is going to work just like any other ETF of yours. You buy and sell it on the market during trading hours, you get exposure to the underlying investment and you can sell whatever it is you want in a tax-efficient way.\" One drawback of owning an ETF rather than owning bitcoin directly in a separate account is that an ETF charges an annual management fee. Expense ratios on the 11 new funds range from 0.2% of your assets in the fund to 1.5%, though several firms are temporarily waiving or lowering their fees to get customers in the door. Notably, some popular crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, charge investors fees for trading bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nMore ETFs are likely coming"

        "content": "Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally granted a long-standing wish of cryptocurrency market participants and exchange traded funds (ETFs) user by approving spot bitcoin ETFs. To be precise, the commission approved 11 such products.\n\nThe news has been a good news/bad news scenario. Last year, bitcoin more than doubled in anticipation that related spot bitcoin ETFs would finally come to life in the U.S. That set the stage for a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened. However, much of the digital currency\u2019s retrenchment in recent days is believed to be attributable to investors selling the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which was converted from an index fund to an ETF.\n\nOn the other hand, the good news is that spot bitcoin ETFs are finally here and these products could expand the universe of advisors and investors accessing cryptocurrency.\n\nOne caveat: With rookie ETFs with the same investment objective coming to market at the same time, end users have some homework to do to determine which spot bitcoin is best for them. I\u2019ll help with some of that homework here.\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n\nThe VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) likely takes the take for best ticker among the new spot bitcoin ETFs as it adopts the acronym for \u201chold on for dear life,\u201d which is often used in crypto parlance. HODL was seeded with more than $72 million, good for one of the largest tallies among the 11 spotcoin funds. While an ETF\u2019s seed capital is just a small part of its story, that sturdy sum highlights VanEck\u2019s commitment to this product.\n\nThat figure has since grown to $81.74 million, indicating HODL is off to a solid start and could soon surpass the $100 million assets under management range that is often important in the ETF space. Each 1,000 shares of HODL represents 1.132 bitcoin and its 0.25% annual expense ratio is the second-lowest among the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Plus, HODL has enviable DNA.\n\n\u201cVanEck was the first established ETF issuer to prioritize this type of product. And it has taken more than six years to get to this launch today. As an experienced asset manager with significant crypto expertise, we\u2019re in a unique position to help investors who have been waiting for this kind of vehicle to begin their own bitcoin journey,\u201d said VanEck CEO Jan van Eck in a statement.\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) is sponsored by Valkyrie Digital Assets and comes with an expense ratio of 0.25% per year and that\u2019s being waived for the first three months. That could be an attractive proposition for cost-conscious investors that are taking a long-term view of bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate - New York Variant (the \u201cIndex\u201d), less the Trust\u2019s liabilities and expenses. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in bitcoin,\u201d according to the issuer.\n\nValkyrie offers several other crypto-related ETFs that preceded BRRR and that competency, along with the debut of BRRR, could have been a factor in CoinShares\u2019 recent decision to move forward with an acquisition of Tennessee-based Valkyrie. With that, BRRR and the other Valkyrie ETFs could, at some point, bear the CoinShares name.\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC)\n\nThe Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) also charges 0.25% annually, but that fee is being waived until July. Additionally, Fidelity is one of the most recognizable brands in the spot bitcoin ETF arena and its distribution capabilities and advisor platforms could propel FBTC to rapid adoption among the registered investment advisor (RIA)/wealth management community.\n\nThat\u2019s the opposite approach of rival Vanguard, which is barring clients from transacting in the new spot bitcoin ETFs. This isn\u2019t a new approach for Fidelity. The fund giant has been involved with crypto for a decade and last year, its Wealthscape platform used by wealth managers added Fidelity Crypto. In fact, the issuer is framing FBTC as the go-to spot bitcoin ETF for RIAs.\n\n\u201cFBTC offers a familiar investment structure, standard reporting, and transparent pricing for easy incorporation into client portfolio,\u201d notes Fidelity.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
