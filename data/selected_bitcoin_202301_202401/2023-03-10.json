        "content": "In this article BTC.CM=\n\nETH.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin briefly fell 8% to below $20,000 on Friday, hitting a near-two-month low, after a stock market sell-off in the U.S. and the collapse of a crypto-focused lender. The cryptocurrency market saw more than $70 billion wiped off its value over the course of the 24 hours. Bitcoin was last trading lower by just 2.7% at $19,944.66, according to Coin Metrics. Ether was last down 2.6% at $1,414.21. The crypto sell-off has been prompted by a number of factors. The movement of cryptocurrency prices is quite closely correlated to U.S. stock markets, in particular the tech-heavy Nasdaq .\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that interest rates may go higher \u2014and stay higher \u2014 than expected. The raising of interest rates over the past year has weighed on risk assets such as stocks, and in particular cryptocurrencies. \"There is just little reason to buy bitcoin now as the market is saturated with negative developments, not just specifically for the crypto industry, but also for the wider financial market as well,\" Yuya Hasegawa, an analyst at Japanese crypto firm Bitbank, told CNBC via email.\n\nBanking worries\n\nAnother major factor weighing on crypto prices is the collapse of Silvergate Capital, a major lender to the crytpo industry. Silvergate said Wednesday it is winding down operations and liquidating its bank. Silvergate's fall is another example how the collapse of major cryptocurrency exchange FTX continues to have an impact on the industry. FTX was a big customer of Silvergate. Separately, on Friday morning the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation closed Silicon Valley Bank and took control of its deposits, making it the largest U.S. bank failure since the global financial crisis. The bank's parent company, SVB Financial, said late Wednesday that it sold off $21 billion worth of its holdings at a $1.8 billion loss. SVB was a major bank in the technology start-up space.\n\nwatch now"

        "title": "Reviewing Code Is Mind-Numbing: Q&A With Bitcoin Maintainer Andrew Chow - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nFew people understand the key technical issues currently facing the world\u2019s dominant cryptocurrency. Andrew Chow is one of them.\n\nChow is one of four \u201cmaintainers\u201d for Bitcoin Core (or just Core), the most popular software for connecting to the Bitcoin network.\n\nMaintainers review changes to Bitcoin Core known as \u201ccommits,\u201d which are submitted \u2013 by fellow Bitcoin developers \u2013 as \u201cpull requests\u201d or \u201cPRs.\u201d Chow and other maintainers then approve or \u201cmerge\u201d those changes into Core\u2019s source code. The \u201ccode review\u201d is critical to ensuring no buggy code gets merged.\n\nThe process is transparent, and as Chow combs through commits he livestreams the process on Twitch.\n\nChow is a gamer at heart, and only got into Bitcoin in high school to pay for video games he couldn\u2019t otherwise afford. His parents wouldn\u2019t give him a credit card, open a bank account for him or even give him an allowance. He resorted to freelancing on the BitcoinTalk forum and began writing code in exchange for bitcoin (BTC).\n\nChow, who says he's now in his mid-20s, gets paid as an engineer at the Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream, where aside from a few corporate tasks, his main priority is working on Bitcoin Core.\n\nHe says code review is one of the biggest challenges Bitcoin faces today. Most Core developers are keen on writing code for new features, but few enjoy the more mundane task of reviewing code submitted by their peers. Chow says more contributors need to focus on code review to tackle the 300-plus PRs in Core\u2019s GitHub repository. The community has a Bitcoin Core PR Review Club that meets weekly to help newer contributors learn about the review process.\n\nChow agreed to an interview with CoinDesk at the Advancing Bitcoin conference in London. He elaborated on why code review is so critical, explained what Bitcoin Core contributors do every day, and weighed in on the current debate over op_vault and Speedy Trial. Here\u2019s a partial transcript of that interview.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinDesk: How did you discover Bitcoin?\n\nAndrew Chow: When I was younger, in high school, I didn't have a bank account because I was under 18. My parents didn't open one for me. I didn't have a credit card \u2013 even a supervised credit card \u2013 and I didn't have an allowance. But Steam was selling games for bitcoin. If you do PC gaming, you can download Steam and it has basically all the PC games.\n\nAlso, on purse.io, you could sell bitcoin for stuff. Well, I wanted to play games. I wanted to buy them. I mean, I'm okay with pirating but, you know, pirating things is kind of sketchy. You don't know what you're downloading. It could be complete malware.\n\nSo I was, like, this bitcoin thing is fully electronic. Maybe I can use that to buy games \u2013 but how do I get bitcoin? Maybe I can do some work and get paid in bitcoin.\n\nI know a few people who did that. So that's how I learned programming. I\u2019d go on BitcoinTalk and people would say, \u201cI will pay you however much to write me a script that does this.\u201d\n\nWell, that seemed simple enough. I also had a friend in high school. He was, like, \u201cHey, have you heard about this bitcoin thing? I think you might like it.\u201d He was definitely buying drugs with bitcoin.\n\nSo that's how I got into Bitcoin. And eventually I was like, \u201cWell, I'm using this wallet and I'm running into these issues. I clearly know how to write a program. Maybe I can fix this wallet.\u201d That's how I got into doing development.\n\nI was running this thing called Armory. Which was basically not maintained. I mean, it's still kind of maintained by one guy, so barely.\n\nBy the time I was using it, it was kind of a mess and it didn't always work. I was finding that some of the problems that were happening in Armory were caused by things that Bitcoin Core was doing. So I started going into Bitcoin Core and asking what\u2019s Bitcoin Core doing? Oh, Bitcoin Core has this bug that's causing us to have a bug.\n\nArmory was doing something not recommended, which was to read the block files directly from Bitcoin Core \u2013 you're not supposed to do that. When they changed the format, it broke everything.\n\nI was trying to reconcile the two, and then Armory just kind of fell off my map. That's how I transitioned to Bitcoin Core. I eventually stopped working on Armory because I got more done on Core.\n\nYesterday we talked about the ratio of Bitcoin contributors who review code versus contributors who write code. Can you share your thoughts on that?\n\nOur main bottleneck in Bitcoin Core has been review. We have 300-plus PRs open and they need to be reviewed. Whether it\u2019s just to make sure the code is good or just conceptually like, \u201cDo we even want this change?\u201d\n\nThe problem with every PR is that one person usually writes it, but we need multiple people to review it, give an approval or leave comments. Therefore, we must have more reviewers than people writing, but that's just not how it works.\n\nPersonally, I find code review to be a little bit boring. It's a little annoying and it can be kind of mind-numbing. But I still do it. I guess it's like a necessary evil and it's because I don't find it fun. If I do it enoug I start feeling like I\u2019ll burn out because it's no longer enjoyable.\n\nSo you have to find some balance between writing code and reviewing code. It\u2019s a bit of a catch-22. We have to have more reviewers than coders, but how do you become competent enough to review code if you're not writing code? It's a conundrum.\n\nWe're in a bear market and organizations like Brink that fund Bitcoin development are saying funding is down by about 50%. Why do we need to pay Bitcoin contributors and developers?\n\nFundamentally, every piece of software has bugs. There will always be bugs to find and bugs to fix. That's just general software maintenance that must happen.\n\nAnd even then, the software that exists now cannot last forever. Operating systems will evolve and libraries will evolve and change. Eventually the software will just stop compiling on a computer; it might just stop running. And so, there needs to be constant work just to keep it up to date.\n\nSo there are always things to update, even without new features. But there are new features and we do want to improve Bitcoin. Not just the consensus rules, but also how we relay transactions, what kind of transactions we accept into the mempool and the peer-to-peer protocol.\n\nThere can be DoS vectors we want to fix or change that maybe haven't been discovered yet. There's always something.\n\nIf I'm a new Core contributor, what are some of the big issues I would need to know about?\n\nThere are currently a number of issues that exist, like pinning attacks, that are pretty well documented. It seems to be that no one exploits them, but that's not a good reason to not fix them.\n\nThere's been a lot of work on the mempool \u2013 how and what transactions are accepted into the mempool, what methods there are for fee bumping, and things like that. It's relevant to Lightning and other [layer 2] networks.\n\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cpinning attack?\u201d\n\nIf both of us open a Lightning channel together, I can make it so that you can never bump the fee on that transaction. So I can make it perpetually low-fee and it never gets mined, then try to double-spend it later.\n\nThere's a bunch of attacks you can do with the existing mempool policy rules. These are documented on the mailing list and they're definitely problems. If someone tried to exploit them it would be annoying, but I don't think we've seen anyone try to exploit them.\n\nWe still want to fix them and there's been a lot of work on making improvements so that we don't have these pinning attacks, or at least, if you want to pin a transaction, it'll be really expensive.\n\nWe also discussed op_vault and Speed Trial yesterday. There have been some tensions around James O\u2019Beirne\u2019s recommendation to deploy op_vault using Speedy Trial. Any comments?\n\nWith a new proposal like that, deployment should be the last thing to think about.\n\nSome ideas on how to deploy things are, for some reason, contentious. If you want to have a discussion about the proposal, having deployment in there kind of causes it to be derailed.\n\nSo I do think James putting that in there was probably a mistake. The Taproot deployment section wasn't defined until after Taproot. The code changes themselves were merged into Bitcoin Core but not active. It's not unusual to just say we'll deal with deployment after we figure out what we want the code changes to be.\n\nSpeedy Trial was an experiment for Taproot. We've tried different deployment methods over the years with varying degrees of success."
