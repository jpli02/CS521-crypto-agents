        "content": "Marathon Digital Holdings Donates $500K to Bitcoin Software\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings Donates $500K to Bitcoin Software\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings, a leading Bitcoin mining company, has announced its commitment to supporting the development and maintenance of the open-source Bitcoin Core client software. During the Bitcoin 2023 conference held in Miami, Florida, Marathon said they will match donations to the non-profit Bitcoin research and development firm Brink, up to $500,000 on a two-for-one basis. Following the conference, Marathon will continue to match additional donations on a one-for-one basis until December 31. These contributions will be used to fund grants and programs that financially support Bitcoin Core developers, ensuring the continuous improvement of the world's dominant blockchain. Marathon CEO Fred Thiel emphasized the importance of compensating these developers, who often rely on grants to sustain their work, and expressed his desire to engage other industry partners in supporting this vital ecosystem.\n\nThe recent market downturn in the crypto industry, known as the \"crypto winter,\" had raised concerns about funding for Bitcoin development. However, Marathon's generous pledge, which may reach $1 million with third-party donations, demonstrates the company's commitment to bolstering the Bitcoin funding landscape. Thiel highlighted the reliance of developers on their personal resources and the necessity of grants, such as those provided by Brink, to ensure their financial stability. Brink, founded in 2020, supports Bitcoin protocol development through its fellowship mentor program and developer grant program. Thiel and Brink's co-founder and executive director, Mike Schmidt, jointly announced this initiative during the conference, garnering significant support."

        "content": "A leaked document distributed to Democratic House Financial Services Committee members has revealed the \u201ckey messages\u201d legislators were advised to keep to, which might result in practically all cryptocurrencies being classified as securities.\n\nAs governments and regulatory agencies impose more robust controls on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors and enthusiasts are left worrying about the potential repercussions.\n\nOne fascinating issue arises: if the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) tumbles, will meme currencies become more popular? Will DogeMiyagi ($MIYAGI) become the meme market leader?\n\nFurthermore, would cryptocurrencies in presale garner greater interest because they are untouched by the current market trend?\n\nThe Great Crypto Cliffhanger: Bitcoin\u2019s Precarious Position and Ethereum\u2019s Fate in the Balance\n\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price is perched precariously on a stable support level, making it a compelling opportunity for eager buyers to accumulate. After several failed attempts to break free and soar to new heights, BTC is back at the notorious $27,000 barrier, like a stubborn explorer refusing to surrender to the depths.\n\nOh, the drama! After seven days of relentless selling, Bitcoin\u2019s price has finally taken a break from the madness, settling down for a cosy consolidation around the familiar $27,000 support level. It\u2019s like the calm after a stormy affair, where BTC is catching its breath, unsure of its following path.\n\nWill it sweep Monday\u2019s low at $26,694, teasing us with a swift recovery and reclaiming its support level throne? Or will it succumb to the temptation of becoming a resistance barrier, shattering our bullish dreams and potentially triggering a merciless correction to $25,290 and $23,905 levels? The plot thickens.\n\nMeanwhile, our beloved Ethereum (ETH) has been busy cooking up some technical mischief. Picture this: a bearish divergence sells signal on the daily chart, unfolding its treacherous formation between January 14 and May 13, leaving unsuspecting investors in disbelief.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike a magician revealing their trickery, this wicked move sent ETH on a 17% freefall, leaving it gasping for air at the measly $1,735 mark. But fear not! Hope lies in the mystical realm of critical support floors, and ETH\u2019s saviour awaits at the sacred $1,705 level. If it can summon the strength to bounce back from this abyss, a glimmer of light might shine through, guiding it on a heroic journey towards the superb $2,028 destination.\n\nBut patience, dear investors, patience! Remember, the tale of Ethereum\u2019s fate is yet to be written, and it eagerly awaits Bitcoin\u2019s proclamation of direction. In this mesmerising world of cryptocurrencies, where fortunes rise and fall with the flicker of a digital heartbeat, one thing remains clear: the intricate dance of Bitcoin sets the stage for its companion, Ethereum.\n\nThe Rise of Meme Coins: Exploring the Allure and Potential of DogeMiyagi in the Crypto Market\n\nThe general public is drawn to meme coins because of the possibility of rapid returns and the entertaining and dynamic communities surrounding them. While meme currencies lack the technological complexity and use cases of Bitcoin and Ethereum, their popularity stems from their ease of usage, low cost, and viral growth potential. The current crackdown on mainstream cryptocurrencies may have created a void that meme coins might fill, luring buyers looking for new investment possibilities.\n\nThe presale of meme coins is another important factor in their success.\n\nDuring a market downturn, presale cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity for investors. These new currencies are introduced through presales or initial coin offers (ICOs), which allow investors to purchase tokens before they are available on the general market. Because market trends do not yet influence presale coins, they enable investors to enter the market at an early stage.\n\nOverall, coins, let us welcome its highness DogeMiyagi to the meme market podium!\n\nMIYAGI is one of the most recent meme currencies, and it has the potential to become the market leader.\n\nThrough thorough audits, DogeMiyagi proudly emphasises its dedication to identity verification and risk assessment. Its commitment to maintaining a safe environment has won the prestigious Know Your Coin (KYC) accreditation, indicating its commitment to fostering community trust.\n\nDogeMiyagi understands the importance of community involvement and aims to establish an environment that values and benefits all members. DogeMiyagi aspires to stand out in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies with its unique features, attention to security and compliance, and commitment to community trust.\n\nDogeMiyagi:\n\nWebsite: https://dogemiyagi.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi"

        "content": "Bitcoin Miami: 2024 Candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr and Gabbard Defend Bitcoin and Decentralization\n\nUS Democratic presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard came out in a vigorous defense of Bitcoin and its ideals of decentralization and privacy. Speaking on the second day of Bitcoin 2023 in Miami, the pair delivered a strong rebuke of the United States\u2019 current lack of clear crypto guidance for investors and entrepreneurs and stifling incoming regulations.\n\nKennedy is currently trailing President Joe Biden with 19% of votes vs 62% in the race for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination in next year\u2019s election according to early polls. He had a particularly warm reception to his keynote speech on the first day.\n\nThe US has displayed a particular affinity for the Kennedy clan over the years, and its latest political candidate\u2019s stellar environmental law and civil rights track record, and strong views on individual freedom, environmental protection, and the right to refuse vaccinations, also resonate strongly with a big contingent of the Bitcoin community,\n\nIn his first public appearance as a presidential candidate, Kennedy laid out a supportive vision for Bitcoin ownership and mining in the States, and warned against the dangers of governments utilizing technology to control their citizens. The civil rights activist and lawyer also announced that he would accept Bitcoin donations for his campaign, thereby becoming the first presidential candidate to greenlight the reception of crypto for a run to the Oval Office.\n\nKennedy noted that he first realized the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s ability to circumvent government intervention after he witnessed Canada\u2019s handling of the trucker protests last year. In his eyes, the protests were peaceful without violating any laws, yet protesters couldn\u2019t access their money and bank accounts in order to support their families.\n\nKennedy\u2019s 5 Pro-crypto Promises\n\nIn what he deemed as a \u201cdevastating use of government repression,\u201d Kennedy said he saw for the first time how free money was equal in importance to free speech, and made a few key promises to the crypto space, saying he would:\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Defend the right to self-custody Bitcoin and other digital assets in the US\n\n2. Uphold the right to run a node at home\n\n3. Defend use-agnostic and industry-neutral regulation of energy\n\n4. Make sure that the US remains the global hub of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and reverse the government\u2019s growing hostility toward the industry\n\n5. Review whether individuals like Ross Ulbricht were prosecuted \u201cfor actual crimes, or as a means to crackdown on crypto.\u201d In the case of the latter, he would consider swiftly pardoning them.\n\nOn Bitcoin Mining and AI\n\nKennedy also took a shot at incumbent president Biden and his 30% energy tax on Bitcoin mining:\n\n\u201cPresident Biden's 30% tax on energy for Bitcoin miners requires an invasive surveillance apparatus to monitor what is happening in individual computers. It sets a terrible precedent in which everything that you do requires electricity and must now be monitored by the government. That's why I also support people's rights to refuse smart meters in their homes.\u201d\n\nWhile he stated that he doesn\u2019t own any Bitcoin, Kennedy underscored its importance in a world of new threats to democracy such as increasing governmental interference:\n\n\u201c...we are now living in this age of turnkey totalitarianism with this emerging technology, which can empower totalitarian regimes. And our job is to try to build and fortify democratic institutions at the same rate as totalitarian instruments are being expanded in their power.\u201d\n\nKennedy also touched on the malicious use of artificial intelligence:\n\n\u201cFor things like AI which really are going to threaten democracy at its base, we need to not be chipping away at our democratic institutions. We need to fortify the ones that exist and build new ones and the biggest most important one on the horizon is Bitcoin because it can't be manipulated.\u201d\n\nGabbard Takes Aim at Democrats and CBDCs\n\nTulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Hawaii, came out eloquently against the direction of her party as well as the implementation of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\nShe said she related to Kennedy\u2019s speech earlier, as she knew a little bit of something about this:\n\n\u201cThey make an example of those of us who dare to speak the truth and call out what is common sense and obvious to the rest of us about their hidden insanity and hypocrisy. Hoping that by making an example of us, they will then cause the rest of us to self-censor ourselves to fall in line and to comply.\u201d\n\nThe ex-congresswoman aired her dissatisfaction with the current state of the Democratic Party and its leadership, arguing that the party has become elitist and intolerant of dissent, seeking power at any cost.\n\nShe criticized the mainstream media, big tech, and the national security state for working together to silence those who challenge the party's narrative.\n\nGabbard also highlighted the weaponization of federal agencies and law enforcement against political opponents, as revealed in the Durham report. She also expresses concerns about the Biden administration's push for a CBDC, seeing it as a threat to privacy and economic autonomy.\n\nThe presidential hopeful warned that the current \u201cpower holders prioritize control over people's lives and suppress freedom of speech\u201d and emphasized the importance of active citizenship and defending freedoms to counteract this oppression. Gabbard concluded her keynote by urging people to protect democracy and preserve the vision of the country's founders.\n\nBitcoin 2023 Pulls in Pro-Crypto Politicians\n\nBitcoin Miami 2023 played host to a string of prominent pro-crypto political speakers such as Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a venture capitalist and \u201canti-woke\u201d activist, Wyoming senator Cynthia Lummis, Governor Ridwan Kamil from West Java, Indonesia; North Carolina congressman Patrick McHenry, who last month memorably grilled SEC chair Gary Gensler in Congress; Congressman Byron Donalds, representing Florida; and David McIntosh, a former Congressman and White House Senior Staff member.\n\nOrganizers BTC Media previously said that the flagship global Bitcoin conference aims to provide a platform for the discussion of diverse perspectives and ideas. By engaging politicians open to Bitcoin and deepening their understanding of the cryptocurrency, the conference seeks to foster support for the industry in Washington and beyond."

        "title": "12 Trusted Bitcoin Investment Sites - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In this article, we will examine the 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites. If you want to skip the detailed analysis, visit 5 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\nIn today's technologically advanced world, people have come beyond physical assets and currencies in dealing with transactions. That's where cryptocurrency comes in, giving users a convenient way to buy and sell products and services through e-money. However, it's important to be vigilant and conduct due diligence before selecting a cryptocurrency investment platform or site in terms of its reputation, authenticity, current status, and credibility. This article will give useful insight to Bitcoin investors about 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nCryptocurrencies remained popular in 2021, especially Bitcoin (BTC). Goldman Sachs started dealing with transactions in cryptocurrencies. In April 2021, Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) was among the first crypto exchange platform to go public at a valuation of approx. $100 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shook hands with Coinbase in October 2022 to create feasibility for its cloud computing clients to deal transactions in e-money. Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also began accepting BTC as payments from users since 2014.\n\nThe most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, had a successful year, according to CNBC. Since 2021, the worth of the e-currency has risen by about 70%, driving the total market worth of crypto above $2 trillion. However, 2022 happened to be unfavorable for most cryptocurrency holders. Throughout 2022, Bitcoin lost 65% of its market share. A series of bad events, comprising the collapse of FTX (one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges), the crash of Terra Luna, and the predicted unfavorable macroeconomic situations, took crypto devotees by surprise.\n\nThe Big Crash\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve began to boost interest rates to combat excessive inflation, the price of cryptocurrencies fell much like almost everything else in the financial sector. That surprised many of Bitcoin's most ardent supporters, many of whom thought the digital money would act like gold does: as a hedge against inflation. In contrast to their predictions, the price of Bitcoin was dropping at the time of rapid inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main cause of the crypto market's slump was the failure of FTX. In addition to causing a significant market sell-off, FTX's bankruptcy and dispute with Binance have decreased liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. Individual investors, particularly those who purchased digital assets close to the highs, have suffered. However, structural issues in the sector have been highlighted, according to Lee Reiners (an expert in cryptocurrency law and policy):\n\n\u201cIt really exposed a number of crypto firms who were, you know, overextended, had poor risk management, or otherwise were engaging in fraudulent activity.\u201d\n\nIs the Forecast Optimistic or Pessimistic?\n\nFor the majority of cryptocurrencies, 2023 has begun on a clean and favorable note. Some investors have turned to Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies for safety as inflation has slowed down, the recession is becoming more imminent, and the U.S. financial crisis is still raging.\n\nAccording to Analytics Insight, some market analysts believe Bitcoin will reach a price of $100,000 by the end of 2023. Others claim that Bitcoin won't rise over $70,000.\n\nBitcoin traded in a constrained price range from $26,000 to $28,600 from halfway through March to mid-April. On April 10, Bitcoin saw a breakout to the upside, reaching a high of $31,005 on the back of favorable inflation statistics that suggested the Fed may decide to hold off on interest rate rises in favor of rate cuts sooner than previously anticipated. Bitcoin has increased by 80% this year compared to last. Although Bitcoin is still approximately 50% below its all-time high, which was over $69,000 in November 2021, the path to recovery is still lengthy.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin will experience a halving event in 2024 is another factor supporting analysts' positive outlook on the cryptocurrency. Every four years, there is a Bitcoin halving event in which the currency's miner payouts are cut in half. Given that halving serves to reduce supply, this occurrence is widely seen as being favorable for Bitcoin's price. In the past, halving has been viewed as a highly positive indicator for boosting Bitcoin's price.\n\n12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites, the main factor on which we based our list is the 'score\u2019 from 0.0 to 10.0 extracted from Coinmarketcap as of the writing of this article. The score reflects average liquidity and investors' confidence, among other factors, on the crypto exchange platforms. We have also mentioned the platforms' trading volume (keeping in mind that trading volume fluctuates at any given time).\n\nSo, without further delay, let's head toward 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\n12. Huobi\n\nScore: 6.5\n\nTrading Volume: $298,644,218\n\nHuobi is one of the most trusted platforms for bitcoin trade, but the platform alos has its own coin. The native cryptocurrency of Huobi Global exchange is called Huobi Token (HT). Huobi users received Huobi Token in 2018 as part of a unique giveaway program that gave tokens out for free to platform users.\n\n11. Gemini\n\nScore: 6.6\n\nTrading Volume: $8,048,955\n\nAlthough Gemini supports fewer cryptocurrencies (including BTC), it places a strong emphasis on the security and compliance of the funds that its consumers invest with it. Despite having fewer assets, this platform is still a great choice for both new and seasoned traders due to its strong security emphasis and selection of tools and products.\n\nGemini has become the first SOC 2-certified cryptocurrency exchange in the market, demonstrating its dedication to security. The SOC 2 evaluation gauges a company's or product's levels of compliance and safety and is conducted by outside auditors.\n\n10. Gate.io\n\nScore: 6.6\n\nTrading Volume: $322,173,059\n\nAn investor can trade BTC on Gate.io for a maximum trading cost of 0.2%. Customers can decrease this charge in a number of ways, including by using the utility token of Gate.io. While not the cheapest on the market, this cost is also not the most expensive either.\n\n9. LBank\n\nScore: 6.6\n\nTrading Volume: $573,256,808\n\nLBank offers a web-based trading platform that is unique in many ways. The site also includes a number of sophisticated tools and features, including the technical analysis indicators RSI, KDJ, MACD, and CCI. The exchange platform also includes a volume window below the order windows and a market depth window below the chart. All of the attributes are displayed in an intuitive way.\n\n8. Bitfinex\n\nScore: 7.0\n\nTrading Volume: $28,683,171\n\nBitfinex, which was established in 2012, has comparatively cheap trading costs, with the majority of trade deals costing just 0.20% or less. Their trading interface is easy to use, and seasoned traders will value the capabilities and possibilities it provides. To test one\u2019s approach before investing real capital, an individual may start with a free paper trading account that provides them access to the Bitfinex platform and handles their money with convenience (this is akin to a stock market game).\n\n7. Bybit\n\nScore: 7.0\n\nTrading Volume: $217,986,015\n\nInvestors on Bybit can leverage their funds 100 times for Bitcoin and 50 times for other currencies. Additionally, users can also avail the option of purchasing temporary loss insurance. Both the site and the mobile app have attractive features for its loyal investors. Bybit provides traders with the Market Maker Incentive Program, which gives a maker fee reimbursement of up to 0.015%.\n\n6. Bitstamp\n\nScore: 7.1\n\nTrading Volume: $32,635,496\n\nDue to the presence of a small selection of currencies, Bitstamp is perhaps better suited for freshies and casual traders. Bitstamp Tradeview, Bitstamp.net, and Bitstamp Mobile are the three platforms that traders may utilize to trade. On all platforms, trading fees are the same. For users with less than $10,000 in trading activity over the last 30 days, the maximum trading cost on Bitstamp is merely 0.50%. Investors who trade larger sums each month would see a significant reduction in fees, which is on par with, or cheaper than what other well-known crypto exchanges charge.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Trusted Bitcoin Investment Sites.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Trusted Bitcoin Investment Sites is originally published on Insider Monkey."
