        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices rose broadly on Monday, with bitcoin climbing above $27,000 for the first time this month.\n\nBitcoin was last higher by less than 1% at $26,685.97, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier it rose as much as almost 4% to $27,403.17. Ether was slightly higher also and trading at $1,635.90.\n\nThe reason for the move wasn't clear, although there was a spike in trading volume during opening hours in the Asian market, said Dessislava Aubert, senior research analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko.\n\n\"In the current low liquidity environment, relatively low buying and selling pressure could amplify spot price movements and spur liquidations on derivatives markets,\" she said."

        "content": "On September 17, 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officially declared Bitcoin a commodity, a distinction that eight years later continues to set it apart from other cryptocurrencies that have yet to earn this status.\n\nWhile regulatory uncertainty still looms over other more centralized, digital assets, the CFTC's classification of Bitcoin as a commodity established a regulatory framework for Bitcoin, one that allows it to be treated like other classical commodities including gold and precious metals.\n\nIn its ruling, the CFTC stated that Section 1a(9) of the CEA defines commodity to include \"all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.\"\n\n\"The definition of a 'commodity' is broad... Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are encompassed in the definition and properly defined as commodities,\" the agency wrote at the time.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under the leadership of Chairman Gary Gensler, has been actively scrutinizing various digital assets to determine whether they should be classified as securities, an ongoing evaluation that has created a complex and evolving landscape for altcoins.\n\nIn recent remarks, Chairman Gensler reiterated the SEC's commitment to maintaining a strong regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. He emphasized that the distinction between commodities and securities depends on the specific characteristics of each digital asset.\n\nGensler acknowledged that while Bitcoin, due to its decentralized nature, qualifies as a commodity, other cryptocurrencies exhibit traits that might classify them as securities.\n\nThe determination hinges on factors like the degree of centralization, utility, and the presence of third-party entities. Gensler's remarks underscore the ongoing debate within regulatory circles about how to classify cryptocurrencies effectively.\n\nOf much debate has been the Howey Test, the regulatory standard set in the 1900s that seeks to establish when a certain investment offers the promise of a financial return from the work of others.\n\nCrucially, Bitcoin, with its use of proof-of-work as a consensus mechanism allows anyone in the world who can generate electricity to purchase or create a mining machine, whose calculations can enable that participant to claim the new cryptocurrency that it creates.\n\nThis distinction separates Bitcoin from the ambiguity surrounding other altcoins, and continues to be a major catalyst for Bitcoin's legitimacy and growth in the financial markets at a time when the regulatory status of other cryptocurrencies, at least in the United States, remains mired in uncertainty.\n\nThe 8th anniversary of Bitcoin's classification as a commodity is a reminder of the progress made in this regard, even as other cryptocurrencies await definitive regulatory guidance from the SEC.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "What Europe's new spot Bitcoin ETF means for global markets - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The crypto world is abuzz with Europe\u2019s groundbreaking introduction of its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund from Jacobi Asset Management, listed on Euronext Amsterdam \u2014 a listing that took two years after initial approval in 2021. This development marks a pivotal moment in the continent\u2019s financial history and sets a precedent for other jurisdictions to potentially follow.\n\nIn the wake of this, there\u2019s a palpable sense of anticipation. As digital assets gain traction, Europe\u2019s decision underscores a commitment to innovation while addressing the complexities of the crypto market \u2014 the harbinger of a global shift towards a more inclusive and diversified financial ecosystem. With Hong Kong\u2019s renewed ambition to be a major crypto hub and debuting retail crypto trading via licensed exchanges, it may not be long before we see the first spot Bitcoin ETF in Asia, too.\n\nEurope paving the digital highway\n\nOver the past decade, Europe has witnessed a steady growth and acceptance of digital assets. From the grassroots level of early enthusiasts trading cryptocurrencies to towering financial institutions exploring and adopting blockchain solutions, the continent has championed digital asset innovation.\n\nThis commitment to progress has set the stage for the current developments. Pivotal regulatory discussions, such as the European Union\u2019s deliberations on the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, have sculpted the digital financial landscape in Europe. These regulatory strides, buoyed by interest from institutional investors, have culminated in the introduction of the spot Bitcoin ETF, marking a significant leap forward.\n\nInside the spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF offers a more appealing route for institutional and professional investors to invest in Bitcoin through a more familiar product structure. The ETF offers a structured and regulated way for investors to tap into Bitcoin\u2019s potential. Unlike holding Bitcoin directly, which comes with security and storage concerns, the ETF provides a more traditional investment vehicle.\n\nStory continues\n\nJacobi\u2019s ETF is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and trades under the ticker BCOIN. What sets Jacobi\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF apart is its stringent regulatory compliance, ensuring investor protection. By bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world, it showcases the transformative potential of such instruments in the evolving financial landscape.\n\nAs Europe leads, US remains reluctant\n\nEurope\u2019s introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF sets it apart as a pioneer, especially when contrasted with the United States, which, despite its dominant crypto market presence, has been reticent in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis strategic divergence could recalibrate global financial market dynamics, potentially positioning Europe as a magnet for digital asset investments. The more conservative stance in the U.S., likely rooted in regulatory apprehensions and market fluctuations, accentuates the differences in regulatory visions between the two jurisdictions. It also highlights the challenges and opportunities that digital assets present, emphasizing the need for a nuanced and informed regulatory perspective.\n\nRipple effects beyond Bitcoin\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF\u2019s introduction might act as a catalyst \u2014 it\u2019s akin to opening a door, inviting other digital assets to step into the spotlight. This pioneering step could spur the development of ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies or even lead to the creation of multi-asset cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s debut could also influence investor strategies, potentially driving more institutional investment into the digital asset space.\n\nOld giants learning new dance\n\nTraditional financial entities, spanning banks to asset managers, now grapple with the undeniable reality of digital assets becoming mainstream. The once clear lines between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrencies are blurring. As digital assets gain legitimacy, especially with regulatory clarity in certain jurisdictions, the financial sector is undergoing a transformative shift.\n\nWe\u2019re also witnessing an uptick in traditional banks establishing relationships with crypto companies, propelled, in part, by the U.S. bank closures earlier this year. In March, Coinbase partnered with Standard Chartered in Singapore for free fund transfers. Following Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure, Circle announced Cross River as its new banking partner. In Switzerland, Arab Bank reported an increase in U.S. firms from the crypto space seeking banking services after Silvergate\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe broader financial sector might witness seismic shifts in asset allocation strategies, advisory services, and financial product portfolios in response to this digital renaissance. The dynamic landscape painted above highlights the adaptability of the financial world.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s effect on regulatory perspectives\n\nGrayscale\u2019s recent court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a testament to the changing tides. The federal appeals court\u2019s decision to side with Grayscale, challenging the SEC\u2019s rejection of their spot Bitcoin ETF, is significant. According to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou in a recent note: \u201cIt looks more likely that the SEC would be forced to approve the Spot Bitcoin ETF applications that are still pending from several asset managers, including that from Grayscale.\u201d This not only underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets but also highlights the need for regulatory bodies to adapt to the evolving financial landscape.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s landmark victory against the SEC has set a precedent that could catalyze the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. This development could inject more competition into the market, potentially lowering fees for investors.\n\nBalancing innovation and regulation\n\nThe introduction of an avant-garde financial instrument like a spot Bitcoin ETF is not devoid of pitfalls. From market volatility to regulatory uncertainties, there are challenges to consider. Vigilant regulatory oversight becomes paramount to anchor market stability and shield investors from potential market manipulations or fraud. As with any investment, education is key. Ensuring that investors are well-informed can prevent speculative bubbles and uninformed investment decisions.\n\nEurope\u2019s Bitcoin ETF introduction signals a new era in finance, where digital assets and traditional finance come together. As Europe treads this new path, the balance between innovation and regulation will be pivotal to ensure a stable and prosperous financial future.\n\nThe journey has just begun. Collaborative efforts, informed regulations and continuous education will be crucial as Europe navigates the evolving digital asset space. And Grayscale\u2019s win across the water is another positive sign of progress."

        "title": "20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In this article, we will be talking about the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most. We will also discuss the recent trends in the crypto market along with the major players in the industry. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most.\n\nWill Bitcoin Grow to an All-Time High by 2024?\n\nOn September 7, Forbes analyzed what the future holds for Bitcoin. According to the report, Bitcoin has witnessed significant price improvements in 2023. After a rough period for the crypto market in 2022, Bitcoin reported a strong comeback in 2023. In July, Bitcoin climbed to $31,000. While the price for one Bitcoin slightly deteriorated to $25,956 on September 13, experts expect a recovery soon. According to the report, Bitcoin seems to be under inflationary pressure. Inflationary pressures forced the Fed to raise interest rates. Such has contributed to a major resistance in the trade of Bitcoin at the price of $28,900. The report informs readers that, as per the Indian government, all transactions of digital assets would be regulated by the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). While crypto laws are necessary, stringent regulations may limit the growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDespite the turmoil surrounding the current status of Bitcoin, the reports hint at 2024 being a game-changer for the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin halving event is expected in 2024, which brings the hope of a boost in the price of Bitcoin. The halving event takes place every four years. During the halving event, the price reward to Bitcoin miners is cut by 50%. Such helps contract the supply and is a positive sign for Bitcoin's price.\n\nUncertainty and volatility surrounding Bitcoin have been a common trend this year. Stringent regulations in countries and a worsening global macroeconomic condition limit the ability of experts to predict the future of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, experts hold high expectations for the coming year. Take a look at the most valuable currencies in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Do the New Crypto Regulations Mean?\n\nThe United States is home to one of the most crypto owners. However, this does not exclude the American market from the wrath of uncertainty and volatility of currencies. On August 25, Reuters reported new crypto regulations introduced by the Biden administration. According to the new tax reporting rules, crypto brokers must report sales and exchanges of all digital assets to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The new tax reporting regulations were primarily aimed at countering tax evasion. On the bright side, the new tax regulation makes processing easier for regular crypto taxpayers. The regulation aligns with the administration's efforts to bring in more money from taxes. With the new bill in action, the estimated tax revenue for the next decade is almost $28 billion. To shed light on the importance of tax regulations for the future of the economy, the treasury reported:\n\n\"This is part of a broader effort at Treasury to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules.\"\n\nWhile regulation is a prerequisite for the mass acceptance of crypto or Bitcoin as a mainstream payment method, stringent laws may limit user's willingness to invest in cryptocurrencies. The impact of the new tax regulations can only be judged in the coming months.\n\nAre Large Corporations Withdrawing Interest in Crypto?\n\nAre large companies with significant stakes in the crypto market distancing themselves from the crypto industry? Is this because of stringent laws or the falling prices of Bitcoin?\n\nOn August 25, CNBC reported that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently ended its partnership with Binance. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) will not offer branded Binance cards in Latin America and the Middle East anymore. Users used these cards to purchase commodities directly with their crypto assets. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) also ended its partnership with Binance in July. Such indicates the growing concerns of holding partnerships with companies currently surrounded by intense regulatory scrutiny.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that companies are withdrawing interest crypto as a mainstream payment method. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) still offer a range of crypto cards, allowing people to make hassle-free payments using their crypto assets.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) offers prepaid cards funded by Tap, Nexo, and Gemini. The company's efforts in transforming the crypto landscape continue, regardless of the scrutiny around the crypto market. On August 17, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) announced its new Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Partner Program. To kick-start the program, the company involved a group of leading blockchain providers to join the program. These include Ripple, Consensys, Fluency, Idemia, Consult Hyperion, Giesecke+Devrient, and FireBlocks. The company understands the importance of having a government-mandated public digital currency. Raj Dhamodharan, head of digital assets and blockchain at Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), spearheading the program, stated:\n\n\"We believe in payment choice, and that interoperability across the different ways of making payments is an essential component of a flourishing economy. As we look toward a digitally driven future, it will be essential that the value held as a CBDC is as easy to use as other forms of money.\"\n\nSimilarly, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is also making leaps in the crypto market. On September 5, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) announced it is expanding its stablecoin capabilities. The company will now introduce the USDC stablecoin on the Solana blockchain network. The company has been experimenting with the USDC stablecoin since 2021 and has now integrated the Solana network due to its efficient and speedy systems. Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto, Visa, stated:\n\n\"By leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we're helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to send or receive funds from Visa's treasury easily. Visa is committed to being on the forefront of digital currency and blockchain innovation and leveraging these new technologies to help improve how we move money.\"\n\nBlock, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a leading financial technology and software firm based in the United States. The company formerly began the development of Bitkey, a crypto product. This product is made to store all your digital assets in a physical wallet. The company is making leaps in the industry and reports strong earnings, which reflects that the crypto industry is far from declining. On August 3, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) reported results from the second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.39 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.02. The company's revenue for the quarter jumped 25.67% year over year and amounted to $5.53 billion, ahead of market consensus by $433.36 million. Jack Dorsey, head of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), also discussed the company's plans and important partnerships to boost the integration of cryptocurrencies in the business. He stated:\n\n\"Earlier this year, we shared plans for the public beta testing of our bitcoin wallet, Bitkey. And in June, we announced our first two global partners, Coinbase and Cash App, to allow customers to buy and immediately transfer bitcoin from those custodial platforms into Bitkey's self-custody wallet.\"\n\nLarge corporations investing in the development of crypto is a positive sign for cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. However, crypto-friendly laws are essential to boost crypto ownership and establish crypto as a primary payment method. With that, let's take a look at the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most.\n\n20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most\n\nPhoto by bitcoin executium on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most, we integrated three different metrics. These included the total population from the World Bank, the percentage of the total population that owns cryptocurrencies by Triple A, and the crypto adoption index by Chainanalysis. We considered data as of 2022 for consistency across all our metrics. The crypto adoption index by Chain Analysis is based on five different metrics. These metrics are a combination of the retail value of the cryptocurrencies, the value of cryptocurrencies at centralized exchanges, and trade volume.\n\nWe shortlisted the top 50 countries from each of the three data sources. The crypto adoption index and percentage of the total population that owns crypto were given a higher priority. Of the two databases, we chose the first 20 common countries for our list. The figures for the total population were included as reference figures to add credibility to our data.\n\nAccording to our hypothesis, high crypto usage will translate as high bitcoin usage.
