Secure your seat today\n\nThis article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk\u2019s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nLatest Prices\n\nTop Stories\n\nBitcoin climbed 4% in the past 24 hours to above $28,000 for the first time since last June as some traders see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against the traditional banking system, which has had its share of troubles over the past few weeks, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and regulators' takeover of Signature Bank. On Sunday, the Federal Reserve announced it had joined with other major central banks to ensure a steady flow of the U.S. dollar, a dominant reserve currency, in the global financial system. Bitcoin was up 25% this month through Sunday.\n\nNon-crypto-related deposits held by former Signature Bank (now Signature Bridge Bank) will be assumed by Flagstar Bank, a subsidiary of New York Community Bancorp, as of Monday under a purchase and assumption agreement, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in a press release on Sunday. Signature Bridge Bank depositors \u2013 other than depositors related to the digital banking business \u2013 will automatically become depositors of Flagstar, and will continue to be insured by the FDIC up to the insurance limit. Flagstar Bank's bid didn't include $4 billion of deposits related to the former Signature Bank's digital banking business.\n\nThe dollar value locked in the number of open bitcoin futures contracts is rising, signifying increased speculative interest in the market and potential for price volatility. Data from Coinglass shows the nominal value of open interest has reached a yearly high of $12 billion, marking a 7% gain for the month. An increase in open interest means new money is flowing into the market but doesn't reveal much about whether traders are getting in position for price gains or losses. In bitcoin's case, the new money seems to be betting on price gains, considering the funding rate or the cost of holding bullish long/bearish short positions has flipped into the green after spending most of the early parts of the Asian trading day in the red.\n\nStory continues\n\nChart of the Day\n\nThe chart shows bitcoin's rolling 30-day correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies.\n\nThe negative correlation has recently weakened amid U.S. bank failures that have complicated the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.\n\nTrending Posts"

        "title": "Bitcoin briefly tops $28,000 for the first time in 9 months after bank crisis sparks weekend rally - CNBC",
        "content": "On Monday, the cryptocurrency had pulled back a bit. Bitcoin fell more than 2% to $27,705.23, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day, it hit $28,554.07, it's highest level in nine months. Meanwhile, ether fell 3.5% to $1,765.60.\n\nThe weekend rally in bitcoin came amid continued turmoil in the global banking sector. On Sunday, UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) in a deal partly brokered by the Swiss regulators looking to stem contagion.\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to trade like a leading risk-on asset, like it has for the past two years,\" said James Lavish, managing partner at the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund. \"The rescue of Credit Suisse has put out a large credit fire ... this emboldens bitcoin buyers who are now anticipating the Fed slowing the increase in rates and signaling a coming pause this week.\"\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, there is about a 72% chance of a quarter-point increase by the Fed, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The other 28% anticipates there will be no hike and that Chairman Jerome Powell may start to ease his aggressive tightening campaign due to the emerging financial contagion.\n\nBitcoin is coming off its best week since January 2021, which was right before the first bull run that year, while ether just posted its best weekly gain since August 2021. The two are up for the year by 67% and 46%, respectively.\n\nFlight to safety\n\nAdvocates of bitcoin have often dubbed it \"digital gold\" referring to it as a store of value, particularly in moments of global turmoil, and one that is uncorrelated with other asset classes.\n\nNow, there are signals bitcoin's price movement is beginning to decouple from stocks, for now. The cryptocurrency's correlation with the S&P 500 is now at its lowest since September 2021, after reaching its highest in 2022, according to Coin Metrics.\n\n\"If one looks at the history of bitcoin and why it was created in the first place, it was precisely for events like this where the current system shows signs of weakness and hence owning an uncorrelated asset helps,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"Over the years, this argument of bitcoin being an uncorrelated asset class has been debated quite a bit, but we are now potentially seeing that viewpoint being vindicated.\"\n\nBernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal argued in a Monday note that the market has been trading closer to its \"uncorrelated non-sovereign roots\" since the demise of FTX and the market structure \"feels a lot healthier, with no more distortions caused by FTX and Alameda.\"\n\nIn contrast to bitcoin and ether's year-to-date gains, returns on gold, the dollar, U.S. equities and bonds were \"less impaired last year, but have not bounced back as sharply\" either, and tech-dominated indices have performed only marginally better when high growth assets were beaten down during the rising rate cycle, they added."
