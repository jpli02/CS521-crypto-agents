        "content": "Argentina's Foreign Minister Claims New Decree Legalizes Bitcoin and Other Crypto Assets for Contracts and Payments\n\nDiana Mondino, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Trade, and Worship, has asserted that a recently passed decree legalizing the use of certain currencies in contracts and for payments applies to Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a December 21 post on Twitter, Mondino stated that the \"Bases for the Reconstruction of the Argentine Economy\" decree, approved on December 20, allows for the use of BTC and other cryptos in the country under specific conditions.\n\nWhile the decree does not explicitly mention cryptocurrencies, it includes provisions that allow debtors to pay in currencies not recognized as legal tender in Argentina. \"We ratify and confirm that in Argentina contracts can be settled in Bitcoin,\" Mondino said. \"And also any other crypto.\"\n\nArticle 1196 of the decree states that parties have the liberty to specify the amounts and type of currency used for bonds or security deposits, as well as the method for reimbursement upon the lease's conclusion.\n\nThe decree follows the election of President Javier Milei, who appointed Mondino as foreign minister. Milei's victory was seen as a positive sign for crypto adoption in Argentina, given his previous statements supporting Bitcoin and his belief in the private sector's role in money creation. Milei came to power amid pressing inflation in the country, and the economic decree was part of his first national address, detailing measures to address Argentina's economic concerns.\n\nWhile Milei has not publicly spoken about digital assets since taking office, his appointment of Mondino and the inclusion of crypto-friendly provisions in the decree suggest a potential shift in Argentina's stance on cryptocurrencies.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "The spot bitcoin ETF race could quickly reach your 401(k) retirement plan - CNBC",
        "content": "Paul Yeung | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nRight now, interest in bitcoin is high. The cryptocurrency is up over 150% this year after a dismal 2022, and the spot bitcoin ETF race has helped push its value higher. But it remains an extremely volatile asset class with as many enemies as true believers. Many major pension funds have earmarked dollars to crypto as an asset class in recent years. According to the 2022 CFA Institute Investor Trust Study, 94% of state and local pension plans had some crypto exposure. Fidelity Investments, the largest 401(k) plan administrator in the U.S., first added a bitcoin fund option in the fall of 2022 to allow employees who are comfortable with the risks and volatility of cryptocurrency to invest in bitcoin within their company-sponsored 401(k) plan. Here's what retirement savers who do see long-term potential in cryptocurrency as an asset class need to know about the potential use cases for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOptions to own crypto in retirement accounts are limited\n\nMany employers have been hesitant to offer crypto in a 401(k) based on 2022 guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, according to industry experts. With options to own crypto within retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs being limited, most people who own crypto today do so outside of retirement accounts. Many take a self-custody approach or use an exchange such as Coinbase or Gemini. Options are also available in nonretirement accounts at Fidelity and Betterment, for example. Accordingly, retirement savers seeking to hold crypto assets in a retirement account typically need to find a self-directed provider that allows crypto investments, and that list is also limited. Once spot bitcoin ETFs are approved, however, expect more providers to allow them, and more options for retirement savers to invest in this fashion, say industry experts.\n\nIf SEC approves over Department of Labor concerns, what happens next\n\nAssuming the SEC gives an affirmative nod to spot bitcoin ETFs, as expected, more companies might decide to offer it within their 401(k) lineup, said Steven T. Larsen, a certified financial planner and founder of Columbia Advisory Partners in Spokane, Washington. The question is how many. The Department of Labor doesn't prohibit crypto in company retirement plans, but in its March 2022 guidance, \"it put a pretty heavy thumb on the scale for plan sponsors considering it,\" said Joshua Rubin, vice president of legal at Betterment. \"At this early stage in the history of cryptocurrencies, the Department has serious concerns about the prudence of a fiduciary's decision to expose a 401(k) plan's participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies, or other products whose value is tied to cryptocurrencies,\" the Department of Labor wrote in a compliance assistance release.\n\nwatch now\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF may solve some of the hesitancies the DOL outlined, including concerns related to custody and recordkeeping and valuation, Rubin said. Still, employers may be hesitant to jump on board, at least initially, some industry watchers said. \"Employers will be very reticent about being the first ones out there to allow this,\" said Tim Picciott, a CFP with Lexington, Massachusetts-based Innovative Advisory Group. \"I don't see most HR departments and plan trustees just signing on. I think it's going to have to be a move from the workers\" asking for it, he said.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs likely to 'be everywhere'\n\nWhile market-leading custodians such as Schwab and Fidelity don't allow investors to invest directly in cryptocurrencies within individual retirement accounts, they have become more involved in the crypto market on multiple fronts, from venture investments both financial services giants made in a crypto trading infrastructure company to a thematic crypto fund launched by Schwab. But to invest directly, retirement investors need to work with other providers such as Bitcoin IRA, BitIRA and iTrustCapital. However, market watchers predict more mainstream custodians will offer spot bitcoin ETFs once they become available. \"It will be everywhere once these come out,\" said Larsen, who is also the founder of Defi Steward, which helps investment advisors manage digital assets for clients. \"This is great for people who want exposure to bitcoin as an asset class,\" he said.\n\nTax advantages for long-term crypto investors\n\nThere are a lot of factors that go into whether bitcoin has a place in your retirement portfolio. First and foremost, bitcoin is extremely volatile and many investors don't have the risk appetite to invest even a portion of their retirement dollars in this emerging asset class. Investors also need to consider whether they want to hold bitcoin directly in a self-directed IRA, or solo 401(k), if applicable, or invest in bitcoin through an ETF. With a spot bitcoin ETF, having a professional manager who is going to be diversifying access to crypto could lessen \u2014 though not eliminate \u2014 risk, said Mark Parthemer, chief wealth strategist at Glenmede, a wealth management firm.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nOn the other hand, there can be advantages to owning bitcoin directly through a self-directed IRA, Kline said. For instance, when it comes time to take your withdrawals after age 59\u00bd, you may be able to receive your distribution as the crypto asset itself, instead of taking the cash. When you sell the spot bitcoin ETF, the redemption would likely be for cash, he said. It's an approach the SEC regards as safer. In either case, there can be tax advantages for long-term investors who invest in crypto through a retirement account versus a brokerage account, Parthemer said. Assuming the investment increases dramatically, a retirement account allows investors to avoid the tax at the time of sale. If it's in a Roth IRA and you meet the holdings requirements, the withdrawals aren't subject to tax. By contrast, if you held it in a regular brokerage account and sold it, you could be subject to capital gains taxes at the time of sale, Parthemer said.\n\nOptions if your employer won't offer a spot bitcoin ETF\n\nIf your employer won't offer a spot bitcoin ETF in its 401(k) plan, you could always ask your employer to reconsider. If the answer is no, you can still open an IRA with a provider that makes spot bitcoin ETFs available. The new spot bitcoin ETFs will be eligible for use in all types of IRA accounts \u2014 deductible, nondeductible, Roth and SEP, as well as solo 401(k) plans, said Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Services, in an email."

        "title": "Bitcoin leaves the rest of the crypto market behind - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Fintech myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the final edition this year of the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we\u2019re looking at the digital coin that bitcoin is threatening to leave behind. We\u2019ll be back on January 13th.\n\nOne common \u2014 and not always unfair \u2014 criticism made by crypto enthusiasts is that the wider world conflates bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf the subject comes up over Christmas, chances are family and friends will use the two interchangeably. In their minds bitcoin IS the crypto market. Yet people working around it, or even have more than a passing interest, know there is much more going on.\n\nRight now, bitcoin is in a happier place than it has been for 18 months, supported by speculation that the SEC will approve a bitcoin exchange traded fund after Christmas. But the rest of the market doesn\u2019t quite have that same warm fuzzy feeling.\n\nA large chunk of \u201cthe rest\u201d is ether, the second largest cryptocurrency on the market, because of the blockchain it represents, ethereum.\n\nEthereum has always been a more ambitious project than the bitcoin blockchain, which is a database for transactions. It can hold assets and lets programmers code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts. That means it is the foundation for so much of the industry\u2019s non-bitcoin activity ranging from decentralised finance (DeFi) projects and NFTs to gaming.\n\nHistorically, these markets have given ethereum a unique position of strength over competing blockchains: if one sector of the industry explodes, so should ether.\n\nBut while ether has climbed a respectable 93 per cent this year, it has underperformed bitcoin (up 162 per cent), Solana (up over 550 per cent), and Cardano (up 154 per cent).\n\n\u201cThis year ether has been totally outshined by the excitement related to bitcoin,\u201d said CK Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund ZK Squared Capital.\n\nFor ether, the problem is that these cutting-edge crypto projects, like decentralised finance, NFTs and gaming \u2014 the ethereum network\u2019s bread and butter \u2014 still haven\u2019t shaken off their past.\n\nProjects like DeFi crypto exchange Uniswap have yet to generate any mainstream buzz, crypto-inspired games like Axie Infinity are today synonymous with North Korean hacking exploits, and NFTs have only recently made headlines for blinding party goers in Hong Kong.\n\nAs far as the non-bitcoin crypto market is concerned, the coins that have performed best this year are the ones exploring the links between crypto and artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe demand for AI investments has found its way into crypto,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive at investment adviser at Lumida Wealth Management. \u201cCrypto tokens linked to AI have emerged as one of the strongest crypto investing themes,\u201d he added.\n\nWhether there are overlaps between crypto and AI is a theme for another day. For now, they are the kingfishers catching the sunlight. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see the far superior returns of AI-related tokens compared to other tokens,\u201d added Zheng, adding that these tokens will be \u201cthe most exciting theme going into 2024.\u201d\n\nBut ethereum\u2019s lacklustre year behind bitcoin is not all down to being superseded by the latest tech hype cycle. US regulators are still pursuing cases that could end up defining ether and other crypto tokens as securities.\n\nAnd ethereum also has to face up to its own disappointments. In September last year the network underwent a supposedly revolutionary surgery with the \u201cMerge\u201d. It was a technical operation, blending one ethereum blockchain with another, but came with big promises.\n\nBefore the Merge, if the ethereum network were a country, it would have ranked in the world\u2019s top 35 by energy consumption, surpassing nations like Belgium and Finland.\n\nThe Merge virtually eliminated the network\u2019s carbon footprint, and when I dedicated 2,500 words to ethereum\u2019s supposed revolution, everyone I spoke to told me it was the removal of the biggest obstacle to mainstream adoption. Ether would even come on to the radars of ESG-conscious investors.\n\nIn fact, the anticipation for a record-setting future was so intense that YouTube\u2019s former head of gaming Ryan Wyatt told me that crypto could soon focus on \u201conboarding the next billion users.\u201d\n\nBut the price of ether fell in the months after the Merge, and while it has recovered, those billion users haven\u2019t materialised.\n\n\u201cIf the expectation was that the Merge would boost investments from ESG-minded investors I think that expectation would be premature,\u201d said Alex de Vries, co-founder of Digiconomist, a website that tracks the environmental impact of the crypto industry.\n\nInstead, ether is at risk of being eclipsed by bitcoin. At the time of the Merge, bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation represented roughly 40 per cent of the entire crypto market and ethereum\u2019s share was 18 per cent, according to industry data aggregator CoinMarketCap.\n\nToday ethereum accounts for 17 per cent while bitcoin\u2019s share has expanded to 52 per cent.\n\nIf conversations with family and friends this Christmas do veer down the cryptocurrency road, good luck in explaining it. And even better luck in explaining how it\u2019s not all about bitcoin.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on ether\u2019s future? As always, email me your thoughts at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nEarlier this week failed crypto exchange FTX settled with its debtors after its collapse in November last year. The agreement, subject to the approvals of the US bankruptcy court and Supreme Court of The Bahamas, will pool the assets of the FTX debtors and exchange\u2019s Bahamian unit to ensure customers receive \u201csubstantially identical relative distributions.\u201d\n\nETF speculation heated up yet again this week when BlackRock \u2014 the largest asset manager in the world \u2014 disclosed in a fresh filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its proposed fund would only allow new shares to be created with cash, instead of bitcoin. The move, while hardly groundbreaking, was taken as yet another sign that the Wall Street giant is making headway with the regulator.\n\nSoundbite of the week: A big freeze from the BVI\n\nRemember Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, founders of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital? Sadly the courts won\u2019t leave them alone to continue painting and surfing.\n\nA court in the British Virgin Islands this week issued a worldwide freezing order hitting over $1bn of their assets. The order also goes after Kelly Chen, Davies\u2019s wife, representing the latest effort by the liquidators to return assets to creditors of the collapsed business.\n\nThe order turns up the heat on the disgraced founders by closing as many possible avenues available to access funds. Zhu was imprisoned in Singapore in September for four months for failing to co-operate with investigations into Three Arrows\u2019 failure; the whereabouts of Davies remains unknown.\n\n\u201cThe order is specifically designed to prevent the founders and Ms Kelly Chen from disposing of or otherwise dealing with assets in any way that might frustrate eventual enforcement by the liquidators.\u201d\n\nData Mining: Tether\u2019s Christmas naughty list\n\nLast month Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin, signed up the US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Secret Service to help prevent illicit use of its USDT token.\n\nUnsurprisingly the number of blacklisted Tether wallets has shot higher. Total numbers of banned wallets are up 20 per cent to 1,236 so far this month, according to CCData.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.
