        "content": "Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $120K by 2025\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Is Up 84% Year-to-Date\n\nStandard Chartered now expects the price of Bitcoin to reach $120,000 by the end of 2024, citing the key factors as miners' hoarding of their coins and halting supply additions.\n\nThe bank also stated, according to a report published in April, that while miners continue to sell 100% of their freshly mined coins to cover costs currently, if Bitcoin's price increases to $50,000 by the end of the year, this percentage of sold coins may drop to just 20-30%, reducing the amount of coins in circulation and triggering a bullish feedback loop. Geoff Kendrick, one of the bank's top FX analysts, claimed there was now 20% \"upside\" to that prediction.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is up 84% year-to-date, from $16,547 on January 1 to $30,455.The bank's forecast was based on the supposition that the price momentum of Bitcoin will contribute to increasing industry revenue since the beginning of the year, reversing negative momentum while revenue declines in 2022.\n\nIn the meantime, data from on-chain analytics company Glassnode reveals that over the past few months, a significant portion of BTC has been shifting hands from short-term holders to strong hands, which is a key element of all prior Bitcoin bull markets."

        "content": "Forget lists of words and alphanumeric strings: a new Bitcoin tool lets you hide the key to your coins inside a rainbow.\n\nBitcoin developer Entero Positivo launched \u201cBIP39Colors\u201d last month, an open-source tool that can convert one\u2019s BIP39 mnemonic phrase into a series of colors, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cWith this method, you can convert your 12-word phrase to 8 colors (or your 24-word phrase to 16 colors),\u201d explained Positivo to Decrypt via DM. \u201cThen you can convert your colors back to your original seed.\u201d\n\nBIP39 Colors translates a BIP39 mnemonic to colors and viceversa. Check out the tool :https://t.co/IGrq8LlCXu - It obfuscates your mnemonic phrase\n\n- You can save each color independently without any order (at home, in css files, png images, ...)\n\n- Color codes are\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Td2sm3igVt \u2014 Entero Positivo (@EnteroPositivo) June 25, 2023\n\nBIP39 is a standard for generating one\u2019s seed phrase, an ordered set of 12 to 24 words that contains the information necessary to create a private key, which is used to create and access one\u2019s Bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe standardization of mnemonic phrases was meant to make it easier for users to recover their crypto in case they lose their wallet device, converting their complex private key into a set of readable words.\n\nMost wallet providers today encourage users to write their 12 words on a sheet of paper as backup, and to keep anyone else from seeing it. As Positivo explains, however, storing one\u2019s crypto as a list of 12 words is very obvious to hackers or thieves who come across the list.\n\nColors, by contrast, \"are everywhere.\" A private key could be hidden in plain sight, and a thief wouldn\u2019t be the wiser.\n\n\u201cA paper with 12 words is more suspicious than a color palette labeled like 'my new home wall colors,' for example, or inside a styles.css of your [website],\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe colors generated by the tool are expressed as a hex color code, a six-digit system that represents virtually any color as some combination of red, blue, and green. These colors can be stored across \u201cseveral files,\u201d Positivo explained, including HTML, CSS, or the color palette of a PNG.\n\nUnlike the word-based system, one need not remember the \u201corder\u201d of the colors to recover one\u2019s seed: all that matters is that all colors are present. The developer believes the flexibility of this storage method could make it more difficult for governments to seize someone's Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cYou can give one color to your mother, another inside your [website], another one written in a web design book... and in the future recover your seed from these agnostic colors,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\ud83d\udeab No, never enter your real seed in any online tool, please ! - Generate random seeds with Iancoleman tool for example ...\n\n- Play with this tool\n\n- If you consider usefull, download it and use it on a new installed offline computer, raspberry, TailsOS, #DTails, ...\n\n- And\u2026 \u2014 Entero Positivo (@EnteroPositivo) June 26, 2023\n\nThe developer also provided instructions for how to decode one\u2019s BIP39 colors back into their mnemonic phrase with only a calculator, not requiring any external tool."
