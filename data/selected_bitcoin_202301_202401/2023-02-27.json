        "content": "By Medha Singh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal\n\n(Reuters) - Satoshi Nakamoto would be proud. Adolescent bitcoin may finally be repaying its creator's faith.\n\nThe 15-year-old cryptocurrency has filled many roles - from source of speculation to hedge against inflation - but has struggled to find a clear identity. Now there are growing signs it's edging towards its intended purpose: payments.\n\n\"The development in terms of building out crypto payments has continued apace, even if it's gone somewhat unnoticed because of the volatility in the broader market,\" said Richard Mico, U.S. CEO of Banxa, a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider.\n\nThe amount of bitcoin stored on the Lightning Network - a payment protocol layered on top of the blockchain - has jumped by two-thirds over the past year to hit an all-time high of 5,580 coin, according to crypto data firm The Block.\n\nCrypto payment specialists have also seen strong volumes.\n\nGraphic: Record capacity on the lightning network https://www.reuters.com/graphics/FINTECH-CRYPTO/WEEKLY/gkplwldyrvb/chart.png\n\nU.S.-based BitPay said transaction volumes jumped 18% last year versus 2021. CoinsPaid said volumes in the fourth quarter of 2022 rose 32% compared with a year before.\n\nBITCOIN AND BRAZILIAN REAL\n\nSo why has crypto failed to fulfill pseudonymous inventor Nakamoto's dream, spelt out in a famed 2008 white paper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\"?\n\nPrice volatility, slow processing speeds and persistent regulatory uncertainty are among the factors that have rendered cryptocurrencies unwieldy as a means of payment. Few merchants price good or services in crypto.\n\nNonetheless, proponents say bitcoin offers lower transaction costs and quicker speeds than traditional cash, especially for cross-border transfers.\n\nAside from bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies including stablecoins, which are pegged to the value of traditional currencies, have emerged as popular options, particularly for cross-border payments, remittances, plus in emerging markets where the value of local currencies have been hit by inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nStellar, a blockchain that enables cross-border payments, saw the number of trades on its platform increase to 103.4 million last month from 50.6 million in January 2022.\n\nVolumes for trades across exchanges between bitcoin and Turkey's lira and Brazil's real increased by 232% and 72%, respectively, CryptoCompare data showed.\n\nCAN YOU HANDLE THE STRESS?\n\nIt's not all smooth sailing for the widespread adoption of crypto for payments; for one thing, there's the question of whether blockchains are ready to handle the stress of processing thousands of transactions at a time, especially without a simultaneous jump in transaction fees.\n\nEfforts by some of the world's largest economies, including Japan, China and India, to create their own digital currencies (CBDCs) could also choke crypto payments growth, say some market players. For others, though, growing interest in CBDCs is evidence that blockchain payments tech is here to stay.\n\nTraditional finance firms looking to embrace crypto payments have also shrugged off recent market volatility. One, Visa inking a deal this month with crypto firm WireX to directly issue crypto-enabled debit and prepaid cards.\n\n\"Crypto is evolving into a viable alternative for more and more people around the world,\" said Mico at Banxa.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Tom Wilson and Pravin Char)"

        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nA new project has appeared on the crypto scene, creating a new use case for Bitcoin; a system for tracking individual satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain, effectively enabling Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nThis project, led by a former Bitcoin Core developer Casey Rodarmor, is essentially a protocol for assigning numbers to specific satoshis that can allow them to be tracked and specifically transferred. Representing one hundred-millionth of a single bitcoin, the satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin that can be used in transactions. By using the Ordinal protocol, users can assign content to a satoshi that they please, essentially opening the door for NFTs to run directly on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) can be a contentious issue, not only in the greater world of traditional finance but also among crypto advocates and Bitcoiners in general. The launch of this program immediately saw pushback from within the Bitcoin community, with people claiming that such an asset has little to do with Bitcoin adoption or daily usage for most people, and might even take up valuable resources. Still, there has been significant interest in Ordinals, as more than 90,000 inscriptions have been minted over the course of about a month.\n\nFor many, the purpose of an NFT is to create a speculative financial instrument, allowing users to provide a specific tracker for a piece of code, typically a piece of artwork, that cannot be replicated even if the art itself is copied. The first generation of NFTs, largely based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, bubbled to widespread popularity in 2022 before popping spectacularly in the year\u2019s subsequent crypto crash. If NFTs are to slowly return, finding use cases in things like online stores for video games or social media, it seems reasonable to believe that a Bitcoin infrastructure will provide many distinct advantages over an Ethereum one.

        "title": "Bitcoin bulls remain in charge even in the face of increasing regulatory FUD - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price broke above $25,000 on Feb. 21, accruing a 53% year-to-date gain. At the time, it made sense to expect the rally to continue after U.S. retail sales data from the previous week vastly surpassed the market consensus. This fuelled investors\u2019 hope for a soft landing and a possible averted recession in the U.S. economy.\n\nThe apex of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s strategy success would be increasing interest rates and scaling back its $9 trillion balance sheet reduction without significatively damaging the economy. If that miracle happens, the outcome would benefit risk assets, including stocks, commodities and Bitcoin.\n\nUnfortunately, the cryptocurrency markets took a hit after the $25,200 level was rejected and Bitcoin price plunged 10% between Feb. 21 and Feb. 24. Regulatory pressure, mainly from the U.S., partially explains investors' rationale for the worsening market conditions.\n\nIn a Feb. 23 New York Magazine interview, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler claimed \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d is potentially a security instrument and falls under the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. However, multiple lawyers and policy analysts commented that Gensler\u2019s opinion is \u201cnot the law.\u201d Hence, the SEC had no authority to regulate cryptocurrencies unless it proved its case in court.\n\nAdditionally, at a G20 meeting, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stressed the importance of implementing a strong regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Yellen\u2019s remarks on Feb. 25 followed International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva pointing out that \u201cif regulation fails,\u201d then outright banning \u201cshould not be \u201ctaken off the table.\u201d\n\nLet's look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nAsia-based stablecoin demand is stagnant\n\nTraders should refer to the USD Coin (USDC) premium to measure the demand for cryptocurrency in Asia. The index measures the difference between China-based peer-to-peer stablecoin trades and the United States dollar.\n\nExcessive cryptocurrency buying demand can pressure the indicator above fair value at 104%. On the other hand, the stablecoin's market offer is flooded during bearish markets, causing a 4% or higher discount.\n\nUSDC peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nAfter peaking at 4% in late January, the USDC premium indicator in Asian markets has declined to a neutral 2%. The metric has since stabilized at a modest 2.5% premium, which should be interpreted as positive considering the recent regulatory FUD.\n\nBTC\u2019s futures premium stuck even after price rejected at $25,000\n\nBitcoin\u2019s quarterly futures are the preferred instruments of whales and arbitrage desks. Due to their settlement date and the price difference from spot markets, they might seem complicated for retail traders. However, their most notable advantage is the lack of a fluctuating funding rate.\n\nThese fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are requesting more money to withhold settlement longer. Consequently, futures markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium on healthy markets. This situation is known as contango and is not exclusive to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart shows traders flirting with the neutral sentiment between Feb. 19 and Feb. 24 as the Bitcoin price held above $23,750. However, the indicator failed to enter the neutral-to-bearish 0% to 5% area as additional regulatory uncertainty was added, especially after Gensler\u2019s remarks on Feb. 23. As a result, it became clear that pro traders were not comfortable with Bitcoin price breaking above $25,000.\n\nRelated: Is the SEC\u2019s action against BUSD more about Binance than stablecoins?\n\nWeak economic data shifted control to the bulls\n\nSince Feb. 25, Bitcoin price has gained 4.5%, indicating that the impact of the regulatory newsflow has been limited. More importantly, the global stock market reacted positively on Feb. 27 after the U.S. Commerce Department reported durable goods orders down 4.5% in January versus the previous month. This data added pressure for the Fed to reduce its interest rate hike program earlier than expected.\n\nSince Bitcoin's 50-day correlation with the S&P 500 futures presently stands at 83%, cryptocurrency traders are more inclined to support risk asset prices strengthening throughout the week. A correlation indicator above 70% indicates that both assets are moving in tandem, meaning the macroeconomic scenario is likely playing a pivotal role in determining the overall trend.\n\nUnless there\u2019s added pressure from regulators or conflicting economic data, odds favor Bitcoin bulls considering the BTC futures and Asian stablecoin metrics.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."
