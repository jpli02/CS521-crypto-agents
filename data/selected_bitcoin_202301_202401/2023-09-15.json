        "content": "Bitcoin rose 3.08% from Sept 8 to Sept. 15, to US$26,625 as of 6:45 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading below US$30,000 since Aug. 9, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, rose 0.21% over the week to US$1,628.\n\njMw 9kUraSJLsrQPc3yHp8nKD71wWmI1zUWMpAbn6qpkqxN8SGD8 lYrZQq5dnJCdrDm4sjunHkIGlu7KhFA4aLjqka cOKsgH3HcE0xIJAzGvm9QeftG7Fk7lozU6\n\nGerman banking giant Deutsche Bank partnered with Swiss crypto firm Taurus to offer Bitcoin and crypto custody solutions to institutional clients, the Swiss firm announced on Thursday. This means that for the first time, the US$1.3 trillion asset manager will be able to hold a limited amount of crypto on behalf of clients and offer tokenized versions of traditional financial assets.\n\nBitcoin rose to a weekly high of US$26,750 on Friday, bolstered by the announcement from Germany\u2019s largest lender, according to Phillip Lord, president of the crypto payment app Oobit.\n\n\u201cThe trend towards more product launches and more geographical diversity in relation to cryptocurrencies is a fact, it is happening, whether in the Lion\u2019s City, El Salvador, Germany, or the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarkets always do what they are poised to do, but never when. Hence, while we are optimistic about seeing the US$30,000 barrier soon, we wouldn\u2019t make a clear projection that this would happen in the second half of September,\u201d added Lord.\n\nLast Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appealed July\u2019s summary judgment that said Ripple\u2019s XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws, but sales on public exchanges to retail investors did not.\n\nImage: Flickr\n\n\u201cIt seems that the SEC is quite unhappy with the summary judgment and is trying to exhaust all means to get a ruling in its favor,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cIt is a common legal procedure to try to challenge decisions, but in my opinion, it will come to nothing in this case. The XRP token may see higher volatility in the coming weeks, but a broad decline in investor sentiment is unlikely.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s appeal didn\u2019t come as a surprise, investor confidence took a hit, with Bitcoin falling to a weekly low of US$25,060 on Monday, three days after the agency\u2019s legal action.\n\nTuesday brought positive developments for investors, after Standard Chartered\u2019s crypto custody arm, Zodia Custody, launched services in Singapore for financial institutions.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s move indicates growing institutional acceptance towards crypto, according to Manuel Ferrari, the co-founder of Money On Chain, the first Bitcoin-backed stablecoin protocol on Rootstock.\n\n\u201cThis move could potentially signal the start of a growing trend for more large institutions to enter the market. As one of the world\u2019s leading financial institutions, Standard Chartered\u2019s entry into the crypto space lends credibility and legitimacy to digital assets,\u201d wrote Ferrari, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nImage: Standard Chartered\n\nThe same day, Franklin Templeton, a holding company with US$1.52 trillion in assets under management, filed for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application. This only brought temporary relief for investors, considering that the SEC delayed the decision on several such ETF applications, including the ones from BlackRock and WisdomTree.\n\nTwo days after the news, Bitcoin recovered to US$26,529 on Thursday, which could pave the way to more upside momentum in September, according to Kadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing sentiment that Bitcoin could rally back above US$30,000 in the coming month,\u201d wrote Stadelmann.\n\nHowever, Ferrari expects Bitcoin\u2019s recovery to be short-lived.\n\n\u201cThe recent rebound in Bitcoin\u2019s price has set the stage for a temporary bounce in price, likely to the US$28,000 level. That will likely be short-lived, however, as Bitcoin is likely to experience further downward pressure in the coming months,\u201d wrote Ferrari.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, the release of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) showed that inflation posted its biggest monthly increase this year, rising 0.6% for August and 3.7% from a year ago.\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nNotable movers: BCH, RUNE\n\nBitcoin Cash was this week\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 13.23% to US$217.14. The token started picking up pace on Tuesday as the wider crypto investor sentiment was improved by the launch of Standard Chartered\u2019s crypto custody wing.\n\nRune, the native governance token of the ThorChain network, was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 11.53% to US$1.75. The coin started picking up momentum on Wednesday and has been receiving increased investor interest since lending went live on the protocol on Aug. 21.\n\nSee related article: Grayscale wins against SEC as India moves on blockchain; Friend.tech loses friends\n\nNext Week: Can Bitcoin reclaim US$30,000 in September?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s double-bottom technical formation, which printed its first leg down on June 15 and the second one this week, is a bullish sign for the short term, according to Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App.\n\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin is likely to trade lower in the coming months, the double bottom signals a short-term bullish trend for Bitcoin. If Bitcoin manage to close the week above the resistance of approximately US$25,000, it signals strong short-term support,\u201d wrote Kiely, adding that Bitcoin could see considerable bullish momentum if it returned to US$30,000 in September.\n\nIn the macroeconomy, investors will be looking forward to the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest rate decision on Wednesday. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, up from 92% one week ago. It gives a 67.2% chance for another pause in November.\n\nSee related article:India\u2019s G20 Presidency, Blockchain Week & Singapore\u2019s new President"

        "title": "Can New Bitcoin BSC Coin Repeat the Bitcoin Price Move from $1 to $30,000 And Mint More Millionaires? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ \u2014 If you had bought $100 of Bitcoin in 2011, it would have been worth $3m when BTC was trading at $30,000 earlier this year \u2013 could Bitcoin BSC ($BTCBSC \u2013 bitcoinbsc.io) repeat that feat?\n\nCrypto investors certainly think so, which explains why the 'Bitcoin on BNB Smart Chain' staking crypto asset has raised more than $2 million in less than two weeks as its presale races toward the finish line of $3.96 million.\n\nBitcoin BSC could turn $100 into $1 million like the original Bitcoin, but it is selling fast \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can buy it now at the Bitcoin 2011 price of $0.99 (Bitcoin BSC)\n\nCurrently priced at just $0.99 in presale \u2013 roughly the price Bitcoin was at in 2011 \u2013 Bitcoin BSC has a much better risk-reward profile for potential investors than Bitcoin, not to mention the staking yield that generates an income stream to buttress capital returns.\n\nTo be sure not to miss out on the presale alpha opportunities and the listing, which could be next week, follow the project's X (formerly Twitter) account and join the Telegram group.\n\nBitcoin is in good shape \u2013 and Bitcoin BSC will be a top beneficiary\n\nBehind the headlines about 'crypto winter' which followed failing crypto banks and exchanges, Bitcoin is actually looking in pretty good shape, and so are the Bitcoin derivative and clone coins that seek to provide a value differential over the original offering.\n\nBitcoin BSC, like Bitcoin, has a total supply of 21 million tokens. However, unlike Bitcoin, it runs on a proof-of-stake network, the BNB Smart Chain, which is a cheaper and more efficient blockchain.\n\nThe latest Bitcoin alternative coin has something else going for it that Bitcoin doesn't \u2013 staking built in by design.\n\nIf you buy Bitcoin BSC today with BNB, you can start staking and earning yield. Token buyers have jumped at the chance to start locking in passive income. So over 1,000,000 $BTCBSC has been staked and is currently earning an annual percentage yield (APY) of 268%.\n\nThe current staked tokens amounts to almost half of the total number of sold $BTCBSC to date.\n\nOften when you see an APY in triple figures, it can ring alarm bells given the huge spread it represents over the current interest rate levels in the advanced economies, which are in single figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nEverything is transparent with Bitcoin BSC, which means you can keep tabs on how many token holders are staking by visiting the real-time Bitcoin BSC staking dashboard.\n\nIn addition, the project's smart contracts are audited, and a guarantee of locked liquidity has been provided by the team for when it is listed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\nBitcoin BSC staking is built on solid foundations and is open now\n\nWith $BTCBSC, there is no impenetrable and opaque algorithm-based financial engineering built on rickety foundations like Terra Luna. Instead, Bitcoin BSC has allocated 69% of token supply to be paid out in rewards to stakers.\n\nThe pre-mined $BTCBSC tokens are emitted at a rate of 0.25 $BTCBSC per block in a block production schedule that mimics Bitcoin by rolling time back to 2011.\n\n$BTCBSC rewards are paid out every 10 minutes in a similar fashion to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin BSC is part of a new wave of derivative clone coins into the bitcoin space, drawing on the version 2.0 theme but, in this case, also leveraging the utility of staking.\n\nThese staking-based bitcoin clone coins come to market with the added security of buyers knowing that they come with a sizeable portion of the token-holding community already committed to the project through their deposits into its staking smart contract.\n\nThis means when the token launches on decentralized exchanges, there will be far less selling pressure due to the yield-bearing presence of staking at the heart of its tokenomics.\n\nStaked coins have a seven-day withdrawal lock, after which tokens can be taken off stake at any time. Those who initiate stakes after $BTCBSC is listed will be able to stake their tokens regardless of whether they have bought with BNB or ETH. But if you wish to initiate staking while the presale is still in progress, then you must purchase with BNB.\n\nBitcoin BSC is not just another Bitcoin clone or meme coin 'version 2' imitator\n\nStaking makes offerings like Bitcoin BSC far superior to the utility-light meme coin version 2 clones such as Pepe 2.0, Dogecoin 2.0, Shiba Inu 2.0, or even the likes of Bitcoin 2.0, whose only resemblance to bitcoin was in the name of the token.\n\nThen there are coins such as HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (HPOS10I) that uses the ticker BITCOIN on DEXs \u2013 although most centralized exchanges refuse to allow it to use it. It does not have a 21 million supply and is really a meme coin take on Bitcoin with zero utility.\n\nNevertheless, as a meme coin that has achieved a level of virality, HPOS10I has attracted substantial interest, providing an example of the power of 'bitcoin' brand name recognition. From launch to peak, HPOS10I has returned 66,000% for early investors, provided they sold at the top.\n\nBut Bitcoin BSC is looking to play at the more serious end of the spectrum, where coins such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV have attracted considerable attention as alternatives to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, these assets are forks from the original blockchain and carry all the baggage and complications that come with that, such as maintaining and developing the protocol.\n\nStill, Bitcoin Cash was the earliest such fork if we exclude Litecoin, and although it is some way off its highs, it has nevertheless been able to outperform Bitcoin in recent weeks.\n\nBitcoin BSC could rise 7x or more after launch, as BTC20 did\n\nThen there's BTC20 coin which launched a little over a month ago and also compares favorably to Bitcoin. While bitcoin has slid, at one stage slipping under $25,000 earlier this week, BTC20 has not only stayed in the green, it has been earning yield for its stakers.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is down 7.3% in the past 30 days, BTC20 is up 14% on its list price of $1. Bitcoin Cash is up 4.5% in the past month, also outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nWe should also add that in the case of BTC20, shortly after listing, it reached an all-time high of $5.9 for a 6x return for presale investors.\n\nAlthough some of the comparative returns cited above may not feel particularly spectacular by crypto volatility standards, savvy investors who have been around the block will be aware of the improving fundamentals for Bitcoin and how clone coins with better risk-reward potential, like Bitcoin BSC, are likely to benefit in an outsized way.\n\nJoe Parys Crypto YouTube channel, with 300k-plus subscribers, is tipping $BTCBSC as one of five Bitcoin alternatives to see a price explosion.\n\nAnother crypto YouTube analyst has invested $840 into BTCBSC, attracted by the APY as well as the token price appreciation potential.\n\nBitcoin halving could send $BTCBSC price to the moon\n\nBitcoin block rewards are due for their four-yearly halving in April 2024, and if past performance is a guide, the coin is on the cusp of yet another bull run. Each previous halving cycle bull run has seen bitcoin hit higher highs.\n\nAligning with that view, Pantera Capital predicts that the next cycle will be no different. The crypto asset manager reckons bitcoin will retrace back to $36,000 by the end of this year and surge to around $147k in the next halving cycle.\n\nTrue to form, bitcoin derivative coins will be among the leading beneficiaries of the halving cycle bull run, likely to outpace many other altcoins.\n\nBitcoin BSC is in pole position to benefit from the mother of all bull runs\n\nInstitutions and savvy investors have started accumulating Bitcoin in readiness for the next bull run.\n\nAside from the halving, the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF and the flood of new money \u2013 retail and institutional \u2013 that will flow into the Bitcoin and broader crypto market as a result, means the next altcoin season threatens to be the mother of all melt ups.\n\nDo your own research, but it probably makes sense to get ready for the upturn by adding some low-cap sparkle to your portfolio.\n\nA relatively modest allocation now to Bitcoin BSC could turn into 5x or even 100x gains very quickly, and in the near future, as we go into the halving cycle, life-changing profits could be on the table.\n\nIf you think digital currencies like Bitcoin are the future but missed out the first time around, then Bitcoin BSC provides a rare opportunity to grab a slice of the action before the bulls start rampaging.\n\nYou can buy $BTCBSC today with BNB, ETH or USDT. The minimum purchase amount is $10. Buy with BNB if you want to start staking straightaway before the presale ends. Those who choose to buy with ETH can start staking as soon as the presale ends.\n\nMedia contact: pr@bitcoinbsc.io\n\nWebsite: bitcoinbsc.io\n\nSocial Channels: Twitter | Telegram Community\n\nCision\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/can-new-bitcoin-bsc-coin-repeat-the-bitcoin-price-move-from-1-to-30-000-and-mint-more-millionaires-301929396.html\n\nSOURCE Bitcoin BSC"

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on the blockchain industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are over 1.8 million cryptocurrencies in the world, with a market capitalization of $1.04 trillion as of September 2023. The market cap of cryptocurrencies reached an all-time high of $2.9 trillion in November 2021. Currently, there are 670 cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide where digital currencies are actively traded. Cryptocurrencies primarily rely upon blockchain technology to record transactions in a decentralized and secure manner. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most dominant cryptocurrencies in the world, accounting for over 67% of the global cryptocurrency market capitalization. Both of these cryptocurrencies heavily depend on blockchain technology, which enables consensus, security, and the decentralized distribution of these digital assets. Notably, blockchain technology's application extends beyond cryptocurrency and finds utility in various sectors, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and identity verification. Popular companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) also have exposure to the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe Impact of Rising Interest Rates on Bitcoin\n\nIn the last year, the US Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates on seven occasions from 3.125% to 5.375% at midpoint. The most recent interest rate hike took place on July 27, and the Federal Reserve continues to express the possibility of further rate increases as a measure to control inflation, aiming to achieve its 2% target. The US consumer price index (CPI) for the month of July 2023 was recorded at 3.2%, and analysts anticipate the CPI to increase to 3.6% for August 2023. The CPI reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, following which the Federal Reserve accelerated the pace of interest rate hikes. It is widely believed that rising interest rates are likely to hurt Bitcoin prices. However, recent market dynamics have contradicted this viewpoint. In the last year, despite the significant interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks globally, the price of Bitcoin has observed a surge of 18.5%. Bitcoin emerged as one of the best-performing asset classes as it outperformed the 12.2% increase observed by the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Furthermore, Bitcoin even outperformed gold prices, which are traditionally considered a safe-haven asset during periods of rising inflation. Gold experienced a more modest increase of 15.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvolving Crypto Investment Landscape\n\nFollowing the debut of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:BITO) in October 2021, numerous Blockchain and Bitcoin funds have entered the market. Global X, a New York-based ETF provider, has been particularly active in this space, introducing three ETFs related to blockchain, with the Global X Blockchain ETF (NASDAQ:BKCH) being one of its most recognized products. Numerous retail investors have expressed interest in identifying the best crypto ETF offered by Vanguard, a prominent investment advisor based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with an asset under management (AUM) of $7.7 trillion. While Vanguard does not offer a dedicated ETF exclusively focused on Blockchain and Bitcoin, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) serves as one of the largest and most widely recognized Bitcoin investment funds, with a market value of $3.28 billion. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is an investment trust that charges an annual fee of 2% to cover insurance, management, and storage expenses. It holds actual Bitcoins on behalf of investors. Each share represents a fractional ownership interest in the trust's Bitcoin holdings. The investment fund enables investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without having to directly hold or manage Bitcoins. It must be noted that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades over-the-counter (OTC) as an unregistered security, so it can only be purchased through brokers.

For ETFs with a shorter history, we have looked at their performance since inception. While some of these ETFs have generated negative returns over the past 5 years, they have posted strong positive YTD returns, indicating their potential to offer healthy returns for investors in the future. These ETFs provide exposure to the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors through various approaches, such as investing in Bitcoin futures or in companies with a strong connection to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\n\nBest Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs\n\n10. VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (CBOE:XBTF)\n\n5-Year Price Performance: -58.2%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $41.95 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.76%\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (CBOE:XBTF) invests in Bitcoin futures contracts and aims to provide exposure to Bitcoin price movements without needing to own the cryptocurrency. The ETF invests primarily in Bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) using a passive, index-tracking strategy. It does not invest in Bitcoin directly or hold it, unlike the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (OTC:GBTC). Although the ETF has been in the red over the last 5 years, it has yielded a YTD return of 51.84% as of September 14.\n\n9. AdvisorShares Managed Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:CRYP)\n\nPrice Performance since Inception: -35.8%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $402,060\n\nExpense Ratio: 1.59%\n\nAdvisorShares Managed Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:CRYP) is an actively managed ETF that invests in Bitcoin futures contracts and money market funds. Like VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (CBOE:XBTF), the ETF does not invest directly in Bitcoin but provides exposure to Bitcoin price movements through futures. The ETF is managed by AdvisorShares Investments, which is a thematic ETF issuer. As an active ETF, the manager can shift holdings, attempting to optimize returns rather than passively tracking an index. Due to its active management approach and specialized nature, the fund has a high expense ratio. The ETF has generated a YTD return of 29.25% as of September 14.\n\n8. Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (NASDAQ:FDIG)\n\nPrice Performance since Inception: -24.0%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $43.04 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.39%\n\nFidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (NASDAQ:FDIG) is an actively managed ETF that invests in companies engaged in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and digital payments. The four biggest holdings of the ETF are Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA), Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) and CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK). Together, these four stocks have a combined weightage of over 43.2%. As an active ETF, Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (NASDAQ:FDIG) can shift allocations seeking to optimize exposure to the crypto/blockchain segment. The ETF does not invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies directly; instead, it focuses on equities. The ETF's YTD return stands at 66.17% as of September 14.\n\n7. Siren NASDAQ NexGen Economy ETF (NASDAQ:BLCN)\n\n5-Year Price Performance: -12.5%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $68.74 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.68%\n\nSiren NASDAQ NexGen Economy ETF (NASDAQ:BLCN) invests in companies focused on blockchain, Bitcoin, and quantum computing technologies. It is at the seventh place on our list of the 10 best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s holdings include cryptocurrency miners, exchanges, and service providers, as well as quantum computing and semiconductor companies. The ETF tracks the Indxx Blockchain Index, which contains companies involved in the nascent blockchain economy and provides exposure to emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are the top four holdings of the ETF, representing 19% of the portfolio.\n\nHere's what Wedgewood Partners said about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was the leading detractor from performance during the quarter. Total payment volume grew +12% (foreign exchange neutral) while revenues grew +10% (FX-neutral) and adjusted operating earnings grew +19%. E-commerce industry sales trends have normalized back to their pre-pandemic trend of growth, with high-margin branded payments keeping track with the industry. Despite this, investors were concerned PayPal\u2019s fast growing, private label payments solutions will dilute Company returns. However, payments are a very scalable business, and we expect the Company will be able to manage both private label and branded to achieve attractive returns and double-digit growth. Although multiples in the payment industry have compressed, especially after the multi-year process of being added to the financial sector, PayPal\u2019s businesses are substantially different enough from traditional spread-based businesses, in addition to having much more compelling growth drivers, that PayPal\u2019s well-below market multiple should revert to its higher, historical average.\u201d\n\n6. ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW)\n\n5-Year Price Performance: 1.7%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $1.37 billion\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.88%\n\nARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW) is the oldest and the biggest ETF on our list of the best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs in terms of net assets.\n\nThe actively managed ETF is focused on companies expected to benefit from next-gen internet technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrency. ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW) is managed by Cathie Wood-led ARK Investment Management. The St. Petersburg, Florida-based asset management firm is known for identifying and investing in disruptive technologies. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) are two notable top holdings of the fund, representing over 14.8% of the ETF's portfolio.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.
