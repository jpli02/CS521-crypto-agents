        "title": "Bitcoin mines could be used for energy storage | FT Tech - Financial Times",
        "content": "You can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player\n\nIt's shaken up the financial industry and inspired legions of devotees. But Bitcoin mining is extremely energy intensive, requiring powerful computers to run for days on end, solving complex mathematical problems in order to keep the Bitcoin system running. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have found the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is roughly equivalent to that of countries like Sweden, Norway, and Pakistan.\n\nAnd while Bitcoin bashers have labelled the digital currency a climate villain, one novel strategy being looked at is using crypto mining as a form of energy storage by converting stranded renewable energy into Bitcoin. Wind and solar energy can be unpredictable, with supply often exceeding immediate demand. As a result, grid-connected renewable energy sources often have to pause operations if they're producing too much energy, energy which can't be stored.\n\nOthers are not as convinced. Regulators in Sweden said even if Bitcoin could run on renewable energy, the country needs those energy sources for essential services. But Bitcoiners contend wind and solar farms are often located in remote locations, and electricity does not transmit efficiently over long distances. Bitcoin mines, however, can be located close to renewable projects.\n\nBitcoin mines could also tap into the wind, solar, and battery projects that are ready to produce energy but are still waiting to be connected to power grids. That's 1,300 gigawatts in the United States alone. Bitcoin is already being used to offset excess energy produced by several global fossil-fuel energy producers. US-based ConocoPhillips is selling stranded gas into Bitcoin miners in the Bakken, an oil-abundant region in the United States, while Exxon has agreed to redirect gas that would otherwise be wasted to mobile Bitcoin mines. TEPCO, Japan's biggest electric power company, is the first major player to send excess renewable energy into Bitcoin mining.\n\nCrypto miners also stand to benefit from arrangements like these, as pressure to lower their energy consumption grows. In 2022, New York State imposed a moratorium on fossil fuel-powered Bitcoin mines, and an ongoing regulatory crackdown on digital assets poses fresh challenges to the industry. Last year, President Biden also signed an executive order on digital assets and said the United States must take strong steps to reduce the risks they create when it comes to climate change and pollution. Another reason why major crypto miners are keen to find greener energy sources for their operations and lower their carbon footprint."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMumbai: The sudden sell-off in major cryptocurrencies over the past few days has rattled Indian crypto investors, with Bitcoin seeing its most significant weekly drop since the November 2022 FTX crash In the past week, Bitcoin declined 11.5%, hitting $26,023.3, according to CoinGecko's data as of 5.30 pm on Monday. Similarly, significant alternative cryptocurrencies like Ethereum fell 9.7%, Ripple lost 16.9%, Solana crashed 13.3%, and memecoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu declined nearly 16%.The broader market was already in a bear phase, but Bitcoin faced an 8% plunge on August 18 as Elon Musk's SpaceX reportedly divested its Bitcoin holdings, akin to Tesla.SpaceX had accumulated $373 million in Bitcoin during 2021-2022.\"Bitcoin's fall below $26,000 last week was the biggest decline for BTC in almost over a year,\" said Siddhartha Gupta, SVP, business and strategic alliances, CoinDCX.Simultaneously, investor concerns were heightened by the US Federal Reserve's July minutes suggesting possible interest rate hikes. Moreover, large Bitcoin holders selling off their investments in the futures market and China's second-largest property developer, China Evergrande, filing for US bankruptcy, added to the uncertainty to the economic landscape.\"Market sentiments changed very quickly after the Tesla news and then there was a bunch of negative news which just kept adding to the prevailing uncertainty. It looks like bearish sentiment will remain until there is more regulatory clarity,\" said Vishal Gupta, a Noida-based crypto investor.Many Indian cryptocurrency investors have halted their investments following a 30% tax on crypto earnings enforced by the government. Nonetheless, a minority continues to retain their holdings, though sudden market downturns are compounding the prevailing pessimism.\"Due to unfriendly policies of the government, I have sold most of all the crypto I held. It's not looking good for crypto or any risk asset that is non-productive, does not produce cash flow. Rising interest rates will hit speculative assets the hardest,\" said Ashwin Nadar, an avid Mumbai-based crypto tracker.Dhruvil Shah-SVP of technology, Liminal, a wallet infrastructure and custody solutions platform, said the regulatory uncertainty dampens the enthusiasm within the digital asset community and results in a liquidity crunch in the market.\"The second half of 2023 has been a phase of price correction across digital assets, including Bitcoin. The short-term outlook for BTC looks bearish as BTC can correct even further into the 20-25k range in the short term. We can expect some green shoots by the end of September or the beginning of October this year,\" said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, India's second longest-running digital asset exchange.Despite the prevailing circumstances, a modest level of trading persisted on Indian crypto exchanges throughout the past week."
