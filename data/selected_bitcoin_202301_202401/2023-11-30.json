        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is formally engaging with asset managers ahead of a much anticipated decision on whether the regulator will approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, according to memos published this week.\n\nThe regulator said in a memo that it met with Grayscale on Thursday about the potential conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The SEC had previously blocked this move, but Grayscale challenged that decision in court and won.\n\nSEC officials also met with representatives from BlackRock and the Nasdaq on Wednesday, according to a separate memo. BlackRock filed for a bitcoin ETF in June, followed shortly by a handful of other asset management firms.\n\nWhile the SEC could still decide to block crypto ETFs, many industry experts expect that such funds will launch in the U.S. early next year. The regulator has delayed decisions on several bitcoin funds in recent months and may choose to approve or deny all applications at around the same time.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has been a vocal critic of crypto but has said in recent public appearances that he would listen to his staff's input on a potential bitcoin ETF.\n\nGrayscale also recently hired John Hoffman, a longtime Invesco ETF executive, as a managing director. Hoffman will serve as the head of distribution and strategic partnerships for Grayscale, a sign that the crypto asset manager is gearing up to launch the fund if approved.\n\nThe growing confidence in the market that a bitcoin ETF will eventually be approved appears to have boosted the price of bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was trading above $37,000 on Thursday after falling to about $26,000 late this summer.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "SEC\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has initiated a public comment period on spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications from Wall Street investment-management firm Franklin Templeton and Brazil-based cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Hashdex, the agency announced in a filing on Nov. 28.\n\n\n\nThe SEC has 240 days to approve or deny an ETF filing and must provide an update on its decision at certain intervals. It wasn\u2019t due for another decision on Franklin Templeton's application until Jan. 1. Starting the public comment period earlier than that may indicate that the SEC is accelerating its timeline for an anticipated \u201cspotcoin\u201d ETF approval.\n\n\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart wrote on X, the social-media platform formerly called Twitter, that the SEC move to open a comment period on Hashdex \u201call but confirms for me that this was likely a move to line every applicant up for potential approval by the Jan. 10, 2024 deadline.\u201d\n\nFranklin Templeton, which has about $1.5 trillion in assets under management, first filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in October. Its filing was previously delayed on Nov. 15.\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 29, Franklin Templeton amended its prospectus, saying that it had responded to the SEC\u2019s questions and concerns about its application.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nWhile asset managers have attempted to roll out a spot bitcoin ETF for years, the SEC has denied or delayed those funds based on concerns about market manipulation and investor protection.\n\n\n\nYet, after the SEC lost a watershed lawsuit to Grayscale Investments in August, it began to work more closely with about a dozen firms to potentially bring the funds to market.\n\nMany hopeful firms, including ARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood, believe the SEC will approve multiple applications all at once to avoid giving any single firm a first-mover advantage.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nMicroStrategy bought $593.3 million of bitcoin through November, its latest filing shows.\n\nThat's its largest purchase since a $1 billion acquisition in February 2021.\n\nChairman Michael Saylor is pursuing a strategy of acquiring as much bitcoin as possible.\n\nMicroStrategy bought $593.3 million worth of bitcoin this month, marking the firm's largest purchase in nearly three years.\n\nA Thursday filing disclosed that the company added 16,130 tokens to its holdings in November, purchased at an average price of $36,785 per bitcoin. MicroStrategy's total trove of bitcoins is now valued around $6.5 billion.\n\nThis month's bitcoin spree was the firm's biggest since February 2021, when MicroStrategy spent $1 billion to add 19,452 tokens, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIt comes as the asset is attracting renewed attention, amid growing confidence that a bitcoin spot ETF is soon to be approved by federal regulators.\n\nThe bullishness is seen in recent forecasts, which put the price at $100,000 by the end of next year, more than doubling after it already jumped 127% this year to $37,788.\n\nMicroStrategy's November purchase is also in line with Chairman Michael Saylor's plan to acquire as much of the cryptocurrency as possible on expectations that the token's market dominance would escalate aggressively.\n\n\"I think that the public is beginning to realize that bitcoin is the next bitcoin,\" he said in August. \"The next logical step is for bitcoin to 10x from here and then 10x again.\"\n\nEarlier bitcoin purchases also saw MicroStrategy sell shares to buy bitcoin, including a $150 million purchase between August and September.\n\nThe latest filing also disclosed that MicroStrategy entered an agreement for a possible $750 million sale of class A common stock.\n\nGiven the enormity of its bitcoin trove, MicroStrategy's stock performance has mirrored the token's surge in 2023, with shares up 174.68% this year.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"
