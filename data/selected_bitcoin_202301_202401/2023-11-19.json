        "content": "SEC Delays Spot Bitcoin Applications Again, BTC Retraces\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts eagerly awaiting the green light for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will need to be patient as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again deferred decisions on pending applications. The recent eight-day window for potential approvals has concluded without any new ETFs being launched, prompting the SEC to announce a review of the applications in the coming year.\n\nThe SEC has postponed approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF from Global X and Franklin Templeton, as well as an application from Hashdex earlier this week. These delays have become a recurring theme as the SEC remains cautious about approving Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns surrounding market manipulation.\n\nAnticipation for the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF has long been held by market observers who believe it could result in a substantial influx of capital from Wall Street into the cryptocurrency market. Analysts at CryptoQuant suggest that such approval could provide a $1 trillion boost to Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nDespite the delays, analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence now estimate a 90% likelihood of a Bitcoin ETF receiving approval by January. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has expressed its preparedness to swiftly respond if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved, anticipating enhanced market stability and liquidity, similar to what has been witnessed with other asset classes like gold ETFs.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nTwo years ago the first US exchange traded fund linked to bitcoin became the fastest ETF to hit $1bn in assets. But the coming weeks are set to test whether it and rival bitcoin futures ETFs can survive.\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) now stands at $1.4bn, and it tracks the crypto token through futures. This type of product has been the only way for US investors to add bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios, as regulators have not approved numerous applications to launch ETFs tracking the crypto token itself.\n\nBut the Securities and Exchange Commission now faces a January 10 deadline to approve one or more pending applications for \u201cspot bitcoin\u201d ETFs, which are expected to provide a cheaper way for investors to gain bitcoin exposure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much life for that product after spot bitcoin launches,\u201d said Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree, which has filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Peck acknowledged that bitcoin futures ETFs could retain some short-term trading utility but \u201cif you\u2019re a financial adviser or long-term investor, I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d have it\u201d.\n\nThis summer brought a flurry of fresh applications for spot bitcoin ETFs in a rush prompted by BlackRock and a legal blow for the SEC after a federal appeals court ruled against the regulator in a bitcoin ETF-related lawsuit in August.\n\nUS regulators continue to hold doubts around whether spot bitcoin ETFs would be appropriate for investors, in part because of the heightened risk that the price of these often illiquid tokens is vulnerable to manipulation. Big trading platforms in this space are subject to a range of regulatory investigations and one of the biggest, FTX, imploded a year ago leading its chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried to be found guilty on multiple fraud and money laundering charges this month. However, industry insider still believe regulators will approve spot bitcoin ETFs in early 2024.\n\nIf that happens, some think the futures ETFs and spot ETFs can coexist.\n\n\u201cI think savvy investors who are risk-averse will gravitate to a product like BITO,\u201d said ProShares chief executive Michael Sapir, whose firm has not filed for a spot product. Oversight of the futures market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and fund administration services provided by a known financial juggernaut both offer support to the model he espouses.\n\n\u201cThere is risk in investing directly in the spot market [as opposed to BITOs] regulated futures contracts being held by JPMorgan,\u201d he said.\n\nPeck also pointed out that bitcoin itself is already obtainable by anyone with investable assets and the technical skill to set up a digital wallet. This should temper expectations for \u201csome giant organic demand right out of the gate\u201d for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cI view the [spot bitcoin] ETF as a workflow solution for primarily the wealth management channel,\u201d Peck said.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management and Swiss crypto manager 21Shares, which are among the firms hoping to launch a spot bitcoin product, earlier this month launched a suite of five digital asset ETFs, including a bitcoin futures strategy, which also indicates that futures ETFs will still have a role. Those two firms\u2019 spot bitcoin ETF application is set for its final deadline on January 10 after repeated delays on a decision by the SEC.\n\nThe potential for a dozen of spot bitcoin ETFs raises the prospect of fierce struggles to differentiate an ETF\u2019s brand, distribution tactics or price. In addition to 10 asset managers filing to launch spot bitcoin ETFs from scratch, Grayscale wants to reinvent the $23.3bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as an ETF \u2014 the SEC\u2019s initial refusal to allow this manoeuvre triggered Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 while Brazilian asset manager Hashdex is trying to convert its existing bitcoin futures ETF into a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock, Ark Investment Management, Fidelity and Invesco are among the issuers waiting to hear from the SEC on their prospective spot ETFs, which trade over exchanges like stocks and enjoy favourable tax treatment. Spot bitcoin ETFs would not incur charges that futures-based products must bear, such as the cost of rolling over contracts on a regular basis, so they are expected to be substantially less expensive than both BITO and GBTC, which charge fees of 0.95 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.\n\nBecause the pending products are so similar and may launch all at once, their fees are likely to be a key differentiator compared to a typical ETF launch, which could drive down costs to investors, said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. He noted that providers are likely to fight for investors with low fees because \u201cthis is such a huge opportunity\u201d."
