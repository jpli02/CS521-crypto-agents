        "title": "Resurrection 2024: Crypto awaits first spot ETF and more - The Economic Times",
        "content": "ETF and Institutional Adoption\n\nA Better Solution\n\nApplications Beyond Finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo much for the eulogies. As I write this, Bitcoin (BTC), the flag bearer of the crypto market, is up 155% year-to-date. The number of institutions holding BTC in treasury is growing. A Bitcoin spot ETF is around the corner. And industries are leveraging crypto and the underlying blockchain technology to modernize their processes.This resurgence shouldn\u2019t be surprising. As with any market, crypto has its cyclicality. When interest rates went up and investors turned risk-averse, fewer capital flowed into crypto markets. The collapse of a popular stablecoin and an international exchange exacerbated the situation. And yet, the crypto ecosystem has continued to progress: Scaling up the blockchains and building more applications\u2014in finance and beyond.Consider the much-anticipated spot exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing applications for nearly 18 Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF applications.While the US already offers Bitcoin-futures ETFs, a spot Bitcoin ETF on NYSE or Nasdaq will open the way for a new wave of retail investors and large financial institutions to hold these assets in their portfolio. The crypto market has already begun pricing-in the ETF effect, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum on the rise.ETFs are only one part of the story. Blockchain is finding a greater role elsewhere as well. Franklin Templeton, an investment company with over $1.4 trillion in assets under management, has launched a money market fund on blockchain. Tokenization of the fund brings greater transparency to investors, and lowers the operational cost for the fund manager. This fund already has over $300 million in assets.European financial institutions are also following suit. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, France\u2019s third-largest bank, has launched its own Euro-denominated stablecoin. The payment solution is expected to improve the issuance and settlement of digital green bonds, among others.2024 could see more such applications. According to a recent report by S&P Global, \u201cincumbent financial institutions will continue adopting blockchain technology to optimize or automate processes or create new tools for institutional users.\u201dThe use cases of crypto, or the underlying blockchain, go beyond the finance sector. E-commerce giant Flipkart is implementing their loyalty program on Polygon\u2019s blockchain. Software major Tech Mahindra is exploring blockchain technology to build a privacy-focussed spam filter for telecom users. Tata Power is processing Letter of Credit settlement on blockchain. And a Bengaluru-based startup has built a blockchain solution to trace the origin of farm produce.It isn\u2019t just the private sector, either. The Karnataka State Drugs Logistic and Warehousing Society is exploring blockchain to track drugs from the manufacturer to hospitals. Supply chain management, be it for diamond mining or fashion, is expected to greatly benefit from the transparency and verifiability that blockchains bring.These developments tell the real story of crypto resurgence, and are the foundational pieces of a global economy built on Web3 tools.(The author is Business Head, CoinSwitch)(Subscribe to ETMarkets WhatsApp channel"
