        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nDevelopers are forking Bitcoin ordinals to give older proof-of-work networks such as Litecoin their first set of non-fungible tokens (NFT). Over the weekend, Bitcoin developer Anthony Gurrera forked the code behind Bitcoin Ordinals to the Litecoin blockchain \u2013 placing a copy of the latter\u2019s mimblewimble upgrade white paper to the Litecoin network, making it the first NFT on Litecoin, in effect.\n\nThe effort likely stemmed from a public bounty of 15 litecoin (LTC) tokens by one Crypto Twitter user to any developer who could fork Ordinals to the Litecoin blockchain. \u201cRules: Must work with Litecoin Core 0.21.2.1. Submit the Github repo below. First successful submission to port to Litecoin wins,\u201d Twitter user Indigo said.\n\nStory continues\n\nOrdinals Protocol, which enables users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, essentially creating Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens.\n\nAlready, one report from research firm FSInsight argues that an Ordinals-driven resurgence in development and the expansion in the total value transacted and secured over the Bitcoin blockchain should drive up its price.\n\nAs such, the Litecoin ordinals are open source, meaning anyone can make changes to the code and upgrade the code.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Ordinals are proving to be fairly successful, despite initially creating drama among purist developers in the Bitcoin community. Dune Analytics data shows over 153,000 inscriptions \u2013 a term for unique tokens on Ordinals \u2013 have been created in just over three weeks after launch, with more than 5,000 created daily on average."

        "content": "'Truly a sham market': Jim Cramer says you need to ignore the 'crypto cheerleaders' now that bitcoin is bouncing \u2014 this is why and what he likes instead\n\nAfter a terrible 2022, cryptocurrencies seem to have finally found some upward momentum again. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, is up 48% this year.\n\nBut CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer isn\u2019t a fan.\n\nDon\u2019t miss\n\n'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos issued a financial warning, says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' \u2014 here are 3 better recession-proof buys\n\nRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nHere's how much money the average middle-class American household makes \u2014 how do you stack up?\n\n\u201cThe charts, as interpreted by Carley Garner, suggest you need to ignore the crypto cheerleaders now that bitcoin\u2019s bouncing,\u201d he says, referencing analysis from DeCarley Trading\u2019s senior commodity market strategist and broker Carley Garner.\n\nSome say that cryptocurrencies can be used as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, for instance, can\u2019t be printed out of thin air like fiat money. The number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million by mathematical algorithms.\n\nCramer, however, suggests using something much older to fight inflation.\n\n\u201cIf you seriously want a real hedge against inflation or economic chaos, she [Garner] says you should stick with gold. And I agree,\u201d the Mad Money host says.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019ve been following Cramer, you\u2019d already know that he hasn\u2019t been optimistic about the crypto world lately.\n\n\u201cThe manipulation higher of crypto shows you this is truly a sham market,\u201d he tweeted earlier in January.\n\nIf you share Cramer\u2019s view and want to use gold as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty, here are three ways to gain exposure to the shiny metal.\n\nBullion\n\nInvesting in gold has been considered the go-to inflation-fighting move.\n\nIt can also be a great hedge against uncertainty, as the value of gold is largely unaffected by economic events around the world.\n\nAnd because of the precious metal\u2019s safe-haven status, investors often rush toward it in times of crisis, making it an effective hedge.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first method to invest in gold is the most straightforward one: if you want to own gold, just buy gold.\n\nMost bullion shops carry a selection of gold bars and coins, so you can always find something that fits your investment needs. Just remember, if you want to invest in a large amount of gold and don\u2019t want to keep the stash at home, you will likely need to pay for storage at a vault.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable \u2014 this is where they think you should put 33% of your wealth instead\n\nGold mining companies\n\nWhen the price of gold goes up, your gold bars and coins will be worth more. But gold mining companies can also benefit in such a scenario.\n\nBarrick Gold, for instance, is a gold and copper producer operating mines and projects in 18 countries in North and South America, Africa, Papua New Guinea and Saudi Arabia. In 2021, the company produced 4.4 million ounces of gold and generated net earnings of $2.0 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s also Newmont (NYSE:NEM), another heavyweight player in the gold mining industry and the only gold producer in the S&P 500. Its portfolio of assets span North and South America, Australia, and Africa. The company also produces copper, silver, zinc and lead.\n\nHigher gold prices can allow miners to earn higher revenues and profits, which could translate to higher share prices. However, each company is different so make sure to do your research and find the ones that can keep costs down and run efficient operations.\n\nETFs\n\nExchange-traded funds have risen in popularity in recent years. They trade on stock exchanges, so buying and selling them is very convenient.\n\nInvestors can use them to get a piece of the gold action, too.\n\nThe most well-known ETF in this space is the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD), which is designed to track the price of gold. GLD is backed by physical gold bullion sitting at its vaults and has an expense ratio of 0.40%.\n\nThe iShares Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:IAU) is another ETF that allows investors to easily track the price of the yellow metal. It holds gold bullion \u2014 just like GLD \u2014 but has a lower expense ratio at 0.25%.\n\nThere are also ETFs that provide exposure to gold mining companies.\n\nFor instance, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. It has a portfolio of gold mining stocks, with Newmont and Barrick Gold as its two largest holdings.\n\nGDX has an expense ratio of 0.51%.\n\nA better way to buy gold?\n\nOf course, those aren't the only ways to gain exposure to the yellow metal.\n\nA Gold IRA, for example, is a type of individual retirement account that allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals in physical forms, such as coins, instead of stocks, mutual funds and other traditional investments.\n\nIt\u2019s a great alternative because unlike the U.S. dollar, which has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971, gold\u2019s purchasing power remains more stable over time.\n\nOpting for a Gold IRA gives you the opportunity to both diversify your portfolio and stabilize your finances.\n\nIf you want to open a Gold IRA, there are reputable services that\u2019ll let you roll over your current 401(k) or IRA into this new account \u2014 and quickly.\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
