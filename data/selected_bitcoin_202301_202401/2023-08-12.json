        "title": "Bitcoin price could retrace to $42,000 if US Nonfarm Payroll comes in at 180,000 - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is exhibiting waning bullish momentum on the 12-hour chart, trading at $43,241.\n\nThe consensus forecast suggests a 180,000 increase in Nonfarm Payrolls in November.\n\nA strong labor market is likely to motivate the US Fed to maintain its 'higher for longer' interest rate policy narrative.\n\nBitcoin price just like other assets, is highly impacted by the macro-financial developments. This includes the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the United States. This time around, the NFP data is expected to cause a dip in the value of BTC.\n\nUS NFP: Forecasting an increase\n\nThe forecasts regarding the November figures of the Nonfarm Payrolls are currently at 180,000, marking an increase from October\u2019s 150,000. This would mean that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged at 3.9%.\n\nThe NFP report has proven to have a considerable impact on the crypto prices, just as it has on other investment classes. Strong jobs reports, i.e. increase in jobs, tend to strengthen the dollar as the increase is a sign of a stronger economy. This has a negative impact on stocks, commodities, etc, and since crypto happens to share a positive correlation with the share market, particularly BTC, it faces correction.\n\nConversely, a weak NFP report proves to provide a bullish outlook for crypto since a lower-than-expected increase in jobs weakens the US Dollar, causing a rally for stock and other markets.\n\nFurthermore, in the event the NFP figures are stronger than expected, the Federal Reserve tends to keep the interest rates high. This is done in order to tighten the monetary policy to control inflation. Thus, even if the Fed doesn't increase the rates in the next meeting, they might keep it stable at 5.25% to 5.50%.\n\nConsequently, Bitcoin price will most likely face correction; however, given the bullish developments in the stock markets, including the potential spot BTC ETF approvals coming soon, the decline may not be excessive.\n\nBitcoin price to note a dip\n\nBitcoin price is presently trading at $43,241 after failing to breach $44,500, resulting in minor corrections. While at the time of writing, the broader market outlook is bullish, the short-term picture is slightly leaning toward bearish.\n\nThis is evinced by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The receding green bars suggest waning bullishness, which means that Bitcoin price is susceptible to a decline.\n\nHowever, BTC will, at most, fall back to $42,000 or $40,000 if the former support level is lost. This is the short-term scenario considering a stronger-than-expected NFP report.\n\nBTC/USD 12-hour chart\n\nBut if the report is weaker or the broader market cues switch to bullish, a bounce back from $42,000 is likely. This would boost the price rise, pushing Bitcoin price beyond $44,500 and invalidating the bearish thesis."

        "content": "Consumer bitcoin provider Azteco recently announced a $6 million seed funding round at an $84M valuation led by Jack Dorsey as the company introduces bitcoin gift cards to enhance the cryptocurrency\u2019s spending power near the level of the U.S. dollar.\n\nAmid persistent inflationary pressures in the U.S., many investors are looking into digital assets as a hedge against the weakened dollar. At the same time, changing views on bitcoin are establishing the currency as a player in the American economy.\n\n\"My contribution to Azteco comes out of a deep respect for their mission. The unbanked population is immense,\" Jack Dorsey said after the funding announcement.\n\nBITCOIN ON ROAD TO $120,000 BY END OF 2024\n\n\"We have the technology and resources to close this gap, but until now, no one has taken that important next step,\" he added. \"Azteco is providing so much more than just access to a secure financial system; it is building an ecosystem of financial self-determination that is secure and supported by local communities. I am honored to support them.\"\n\nSHORT SELLER ACCUSES JACK DORSEY'S BLOCK OF FACILITATING FRAUD\n\nAlso designed to bridge geographical boundaries in the retail industry, bitcoin gift cards, or vouchers, provide in-person storefronts and e-commerce platforms around the globe while democratizing access to financial services and reshaping consumer-retailer interactions in an increasingly interconnected digital economy, according to Azteco.\n\n\"Trusting a third party as the issuer of money can result in that third party becoming a single point of failure. As the Federal Reserve and every other Fiat currency that has ever existed has proven, the incentive to cheat is irresistible. By removing this incentive through the issuer and replacing him with a computer program, bitcoin can run a politically and financially neutral, global synthetic money for people everywhere,\" Azteco CEO and founder Akin Fernandez told FOX Business.\n\nBITCOIN ON TRACK TO CHALLENGE U.S. DOLLAR?\n\nThe U.S. economy has been mired in inflation and a devalued currency, leading to a banking crisis and a raised investor interest in not only material wealth like gold and silver, but in digital assets like cryptocurrency.\n\nCentral banks and the Fed are already discussing the implementation of a digital dollar. Meanwhile, BlackRock filed for a bitcoin ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June.\n\n\"The fundamental problem with the U.S. dollar is that its supply is controlled by a small committee of private bankers focused solely on the shareholders\u2019 interests. America\u2019s Constitution considers only gold and silver money, which was arguably done deliberately to remove the inevitable corruption that follows when people are in control of the money supply,\" Fernandez said.\n\nBITCOIN BONNIE AND CLYDE' PLEAD GUILTY TO MONEY LAUNDERING HACKED CRYPTO\n\n\"Bitcoin solves this problem by replacing a committee of men with an infallible computer program.\"\n\nAlready, Azteco has over 590,000 payment locations in more than 190 countries on the ground floor facilitating development.\n\nBITCOIN ON ROAD TO $120,000 BY END OF 2024\n\n\"In the U.S., an estimated 4.5% of households were \u2018unbanked\u2019 in 2021 with no access to eCommerce, meaning they couldn\u2019t buy from Amazon, get a bank loan, send money or receive it electronically. Bitcoin fixes this by giving them around-the-clock global access to a frictionless financial rail using instant transactions that are guaranteed free of payer fraud,\" Fernandez said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"There are 2 billion people unbanked on Earth, and the country that becomes the center of this new financial system will be raking in taxes from 2 billion people,\" he continued. \"A move to bitcoin will greatly enhance the U.S. economy. America\u2019s most prosperous era was when it was on the gold standard and the money supply was strictly constrained. Strong economies are built on saving, not spending.\""

        "title": "Dogecoin Founder Calls Bitcoin Maximalists 'Mentally Ill' - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBilly Markus, a co-founder of Dogecoin, has criticized Bitcoin fans\u2019 marketing strategies, calling them \u2018mentally ill\u2019\n\nHe said there are plenty of ideological divisions within the cryptocurrency industry\n\nMarkus said he stopped investing in crypto nine years ago, right after the DOGE launch\n\nUnsurprisingly, conflicts and heated arguments frequently arise in the volatile and unpredictable world of cryptocurrency \u2013 this time between Dogecoin founder and Bitcoin maximalists. These arguments often show the variety of viewpoints within the crypto community since fervent believers drive them on all sides.\n\nDogecoin founder, who isn\u2019t one to hold back when airing his opinions, has once again criticized the advertising tactics and overarching stories that Bitcoin advocates champion.\n\nIn the brief video , Robert Breedlove, a BTC maximalist, was seen speaking with Jason Lowery, who continued praising Bitcoin. According to Lowery, BTC is not a coin; rather, it is the future of conflict, security, and those who want to protect their data.\n\nMaximalists of Bitcoin: A Better Attitude Toward Other Cryptos\n\nBitcoin (BTC) maximalists, often known as \u201cBitcoin Maxis,\u201d are ardent proponents of the cryptocurrency and firmly think that it is superior to all others. They frequently minimize or even reject the worth and potential of other tokens in the wide crypto ecosystem because of their steadfast faith in Bitcoin.\n\nMarkus cited an occasion where a BTC enthusiast was advocating the cryptocurrency in an effort to shed insight on the thinking of these Bitcoiners.\n\nThe enthusiast extended an invitation to others to join the \u201cmentally ill group of insecure losers.\u201d Such utterances offer a window into the frequently divisive opinions of some inside the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin maximalists frequently disparage competing cryptocurrencies using the nickname \u201cs-coins.\u201d The person who most exemplifies this approach is Max Keiser, a well-known member of the Bitcoin community.\n\nHe once requested that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order major cryptocurrency exchanges to cease operations, referring to them as little more than casinos. Keiser\u2019s ideas, which are similar to those of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, extend to classifying all altcoins as securities.\n\nNotably, Keiser had vehemently asserted that XRP was bound for failure and that it was Gensler\u2019s obligation to ensure its demise before Judge Analisa Torres determined that XRP was not a security in July. These stories have influenced the SEC\u2019s recent activities as the organization has increased its examination of the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nMarkus Questions the Future of Bitcoin\n\nThe most recent criticism from Markus was in response to a video published by Udi Wertheimer, a crypto Twitter user. Interviewing Jason Lowery was Bitcoin maximalist Robert Breedlove in the video. Lowery complimented Bitcoin and emphasized its unmatched potential throughout the interview.\n\nHe continued by saying that Bitcoin is more than just a coin. Instead, he characterized it as security, the future of warfare, and a guarantee for people who want to keep their data private.\n\nman bitcoiners are the literal worst at marketing \u201ccome join our clearly mentally ill group of insecure losers!\u201d \u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) August 12, 2023\n\nMarkus, though, appears to have a strong problem with the content of the video based on his comments. Dogecoin founder\u2019s answer, therefore, supports the idea that innovation is not just restricted to Bitcoin. In the cryptocurrency sector, several additional coins and protocols provide distinctive solutions and show great promise.\n\nNot the First Time Markus Takes a Jab on BTC\n\nIn April this year, Markus criticized Bitcoin as a currency, claiming there isn\u2019t enough for everyone.\n\nThe inventor of the most well-known memecoin on the market recently took to Twitter to criticize cryptocurrency and non-fungible token (NFT) investors, claiming that doing so amounts to investing in mental illness.\n\ninvesting in crypto is literally just investing in mental illness which i suppose is on the rise, so\u2026 \u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) April 22, 2023\n\nThe world is getting dumber and sadder by the day, said Markus, adding that \u201cinvesting in cryptocurrencies is literally investing in a mental illness, which I assume is on the rise.\u201d\n\nMarkus then claimed that since non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a derivative of cryptocurrencies, investing in them causes people to become \u201ceven more mentally ill\u201d when challenged about doing so.\n\nMarkus responded to criticism of his restrictions by saying he was disgusted by the investors who, in his view, quarrel, behave erratically, and make poor choices as a result of an issue with the brain.\n\nAllegedly Owns Very Little DOGE\n\nThe Dogecoin creator\u2019s remarks have been provoking a flood of criticism from irate investors, who claimed that Markus was merely venting his rage at not being able to become wealthy with cryptocurrencies despite having knowledge of the sector for almost a decade.\n\nShortly after Dogecoin\u2019s debut, the project\u2019s inventor said he quit investing in cryptocurrencies nine years ago. because he thinks investing in digital currency is just another form of gambling for people. Additionally, he rejects Bitcoin as a kind of money.\n\nOn Reddit, he revealed he no longer represents the Dogecoin Foundation and owns very little Dogecoin.\n\nFor his criticism of Dogecoin supporter and billionaire Elon Musk, Jackson Palmer was blocked by Markus last year on Twitter. Palmer slammed Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, for his coding abilities and said he used cryptocurrency to inflate his ego.\n\nThe majority of cryptocurrency investors, who think that digital currencies are the future of banking and investing, hold the opposite perspective to Markus\u2019 criticism of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough Bitcoin continues to lead the way in the cryptocurrency world, many different types exist. Billy Markus reminds the public that creativity is not limited to a certain token or protocol. Understanding and appreciating the numerous prospects and potentials presented by different cryptocurrencies is crucial as the cryptosphere continues to develop. The continuous arguments and conflicts, like the one between Markus and Bitcoin maximalists, show stakeholders\u2019 passion and commitment to their individual coins."

        "title": "When cryptomining comes to town: High electricity use spillovers to the local economy - CEPR",
        "content": "High energy use is increasingly a feature of many technology processing industries, including quantum computing, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and cryptocurrency mining (\u2018cryptomining\u2019). Estimates suggest that technology processing passed the milestone of consuming 1% of world energy in 2010 and is on trajectory to increase to 6% by 2030 (Masanet et al. 2020, Andrae and Edler 2015). In recent years, data centres and Bitcoin mining alone consumed 0.9% and 0.5% of global electricity, respectively (Andrae 2017, Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance).\n\nThis intensive electricity consumption results in two negative externalities. The first is the carbon emissions resulting from electricity production of cryptomining, with the website Digiconomist estimating that the global CO2 emissions from Bitcoin mining alone are equivalent to those of Libya (see also De Vries 2018, Blandin et al. 2020).\n\nOur work concerns a second, unstudied externality \u2013 the real effects of technology processing on local economies (Benetton et al. 2023). What, for example, are the spillovers from cryptomining on households and small businesses? How does the interaction of supply and demand impact prices and delivery of electricity to homes and small businesses? As we shall see below, cryptomining also has positive externalities in that cryptomines produce local tax revenues, raising questions about net costs and benefits.\n\nBefore describing our methodology and findings, a brief note about cryptomining, which is the clearing of payment transactions for decentralised blockchain-based cryptocurrencies that rely on the \u2018proof-of-work\u2019 protocol. Any person or firm can become a cryptominer, which involves solving increasingly complex computational puzzles to verify the validity of transactions. This has led to an arms race among firms who run large cryptomines, essentially warehouses full of specialized computers, crunching numbers across the world. And the key point here is that these cryptomines need lots of electricity, while employing very few people.\n\nA tale of two channels\n\nWe analyse the negative externalities of the high electricity use of cryptomining through two channels: prices and quantity rationing.\n\nChannel #1: Analysing negative externalities via prices\n\nIn the first case, we study New York State, specifically Upstate NY, excluding New York City and Long Island, which was an early market for cryptomining in the US due to its cold climate, cheap electricity, and proximity to large hydropower sources (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Bitcoin prices and electricity consumption\n\nNote: This Figure shows monthly electricity consumption for businesses in the town of Plattsburgh, NY, and the neighbouring town of Peru. Before the end of 2017, Plattsburgh and Peru experienced a similar pattern in electricity consumption for businesses. However, in January 2018, when the Bitcoin price peaked, electricity consumption by Plattsburgh businesses increased by almost 150%, whereas almost no change to the seasonal pattern occurred in Peru. The blue line shows the average price of Bitcoin each month. The red dash-dot line and the green dash line show total electricity consumption by small and industrial businesses in Plattsburgh and Peru, respectively. We normalise electricity consumption in each town to 100 in December 2017, which is the month in which Bitcoin prices reached their maximum of around $15,000. Gray areas denote December, January and February of 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.\n\nThe region\u2019s grid operator employs a marginal supply pricing algorithm, whereby upward pressure on prices from demand gets passed to all users, including households and small businesses. We combine detailed data on these local electricity prices, electricity usage, and other economic outcomes with hand-collected data on the likely location of cryptominers, to analyse whether and how the use of electricity by cryptominers affects local communities.\n\nOur findings include the following:\n\nWhen Bitcoin prices are high, the returns from cryptomining are higher in expectation since the reward to miners is paid in Bitcoins. Thus, a higher Bitcoin price increases the demand for electricity by cryptominers.\n\nThere is a statistically significant, negative price elasticity of demand for electricity by the local communities, meaning that as the price of electricity rises, demand falls. These higher prices also lead to larger surpluses for electricity producers.\n\nThere is a positive and significant effect of cryptomining on tax generation. Treated communities experience a relative increase in taxes per capita by $6 compared to control communities when the price of Bitcoin increases by 100%. To put these numbers in perspective, the price of Bitcoin increased from about $600 in 2016 to $7,500 in 2018, which could have led to higher taxes per capita in cryptomining communities by about $70, or 14% of the average tax revenue per capita.\n\nCryptomining leads the average household and small business in New York to pay an extra $88 and $168 in their electricity bills per year, respectively. In aggregate, Upstate NY households and small businesses pay $204 million and $92 million more annually, respectively.\n\nWhen accounting for the differential increase in government revenues, cryptomining towns in Upstate NY generate almost $40 million in additional government revenues, thus recovering about 14% of the losses. As a result, we estimate a net consumer surplus loss of $257 million in Upstate NY.\n\nChannel #2: Analysing negative externalities via quantity rationing\n\nWe now turn to China, a country that employed a quantity rationing system for electricity, and which hosted 65\u201382% of the world\u2019s cryptomining during the last decade before a ban in 2021. In a quantity rationing system, when total demand increases, prices do not adjust; rather, the electricity supply is rationed among locations to align with physical infrastructure. To explore possible externalities associated with the rationing of electricity in local economies, we exploit an annual panel of statistics at the city level for China (cities in the data include the surrounding areas). We focus on the 218 inland China city-areas, which have a mean population of 355,000, and do not include the large coastal metropolitan areas. There is evidence of cryptomining in 52 of these inland city-areas, of which we find the following:\n\nAfter cryptomining enters a city, local fixed asset investments decline annually by 19%, and wage levels decline by 10%, suggesting that cryptomining tends to crowd out other business uses of electricity.\n\nThese results also suggest that the crowded-out industrial uses of electricity would have led to larger investments in the physical and human capital of the local economy in the years following the entry of cryptomining. To put a number on it, cryptomining entry is associated with a statistically significant drop in local GDP of 8.2%.\n\nTaken together, these findings suggest that local economies could suffer as a result of crowding out in the electricity market.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe present novel empirical evidence of the real effects of cryptomining on local economies.\n\nFirst, we focus on a setting in Upstate New York, where cryptomining led to an increase in electricity prices and a resultant consumer surplus loss. On the other hand, local governments saw an increase in tax revenues, although this only offsets a fraction of the consumer surplus loss through higher electricity prices. We then turn to China, where we reveal a negative impact on the labor market as well as fixed asset investments.\n\nWhat does this mean for policymakers? Though likely tempting for some, the optimal response is likely not to ban cryptomining, which would only shift the problem to a more permissive jurisdiction and restrict any possible tax revenue gains. Rather, a better response would be to introduce electricity pricing schemes or dynamic quotas that minimise the adverse impact on the local community. In addition, the effects on local communities we document should be weighed against any other costs (notably, from pollution) and potential benefits arising from the growth of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.\n\nReferences\n\nAndrae, A (2017), \u201cTotal consumer power consumption forecast\u201d, Nordic Digital Business Summit 10.\n\nAndrae, A S G and T Edler (2015), \u201cOn Global Electricity Usage of Communication Technology: Trends to 2030\u201d, Challenges 6(1): 117-157.\n\nBenetton, M, G Compiani and A Morse (2023), \u201cWhen Cryptomining Comes to Town: High Electricity-use Spillovers to the Local Economy\u201d, NBER Working Paper 31312.\n\nBlandin, A, G Pieters, Y Wu, T Eisermann, A Dek, S Taylor and D Njoki (2020), \u201cThird global cryptoasset benchmarking study\u201d, Technical report, Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, University of Cambridge, Judge Business School.\n\nDe Vries, A (2018), \u201cBitcoin's growing energy problem\u201d, Joule 2(5): 801-805.\n\nMasanet, E, A Shehabi, N Lei, S Smith, and J Koomey (2020), \u201cRecalibrating global data center energy-use estimates\u201d, Science 367(6481): 984-986."
