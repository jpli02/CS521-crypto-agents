        "title": "Is it possible to achieve financial freedom with Bitcoin? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Over the last 14 years, investors have been attracted to Bitcoin (BTC) for many reasons \u2014 from being a potential solution to the economic woes of the existing fiat economic system to reaching the unbanked and diversifying portfolios. However, a large portion of the general public sees Bitcoin as a gateway to financial freedom amid growing fiat inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nTraditional banking systems have, time and again, served as a tool for centralized governments to dictate financial access, especially during emergencies. Most recently, the Ukraine-Russian war served as a case study for how cryptocurrencies helped the displaced and the unbanked access funds for basic necessities.\n\nAs intended by the creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin seeks to bring power back to the people. No amount of regulations, sanctions or bans can stop people from using Bitcoin as money. Beyond that, a calculated investment in Bitcoin has the potential to bring people closer to attaining their dream of financial freedom. But how can people achieve that?\n\nHodl\n\nThe massive volatility of cryptocurrencies coupled with the restlessness of an investor is a recipe for an instant loss. Many fail to understand that Bitcoin \u2014 unlike other cryptocurrencies \u2014 is a long-term investment. Hence, Bitcoin veterans recommend holding the asset during bull markets and buying the dips during bear markets.\n\nAccording to data from UpMyInterest, setting aside a few off-years, Bitcoin holders witnessed a mean annual return of 93.8%, which in its best-performing year, spiked to 302.8%.\n\nHistorical summary of Bitcoin annual returns. Source: UpMyInterest\n\nAs simple as it sounds, hodling (crypto lingo for holding assets) has proved difficult for investors. Some factors that trigger abrupt Bitcoin selling include the spreading of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and price movements.\n\nWhile it makes sense in the short-term to earn profits off Bitcoin\u2019s volatility, zooming out the price chart reveals a long-term greater incentive in holding. Moreover, investors owning Bitcoin will always have the option to utilize this spending across geographical boundaries without losing value.\n\nDollar-cost averaging\n\nConsidering Bitcoin as a viable long-term investment option, many investors tend to implement the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. This involves setting aside a predetermined dollar amount from a regular income to be reinvested in Bitcoin every day, week or month.\n\nWhile El Salvador was initially criticized for adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender amid crippling inflation, the country could repurpose the resultant unrealized gains to fund social projects, such as building hospitals and schools.\n\nWith the Bitcoin bull run running out by 2022, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele followed a strategy similar to DCA, wherein the country would purchase 1 BTC every day.\n\nWe are buying one #Bitcoin every day starting tomorrow. \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) November 17, 2022\n\nWhen Bukele announced his plan for buying Bitcoin, it was priced roughly at $16,600, as shown by data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\nBitcoin price movement ever since Nayib Bukele announced plans to purchase 1 BTC every day. Source: TradingView\n\nSince then, BTC\u2019s price has surged 40.46%, providing much-needed relief to Salvadorans. Investors looking for financial freedom must pursue a similar strategy while reacting to market changes and public sentiment.\n\nSelf-custody\n\nWhen it comes to the long-term holding of Bitcoin, the key is not to trust any other third-party entity with the assets' private keys. Investors who store Bitcoin on crypto exchanges unknowingly give away complete control of their assets.\n\nEver since the FTX fraud came to light, the case of self-custody grew stronger. Investors that suffered losses owing to the alleged misappropriation of funds realized the importance of self-custody. Maintaining ownership of the private key \u2014 via self-custodial wallets \u2014 becomes paramount for those that seek financial freedom in its truest sense.\n\nWill be sending an email every week strongly advising our people to never keep savings on any exchange, including @paxful This is the way ! Self custody your savings ALWAYS! pic.twitter.com/DI95Gaa5Y6 \u2014 Ray Youssef (@raypaxful) December 11, 2022\n\nThe FTX fallout also forced crypto exchanges to prove the existence and safety of users\u2019 funds in order to avoid a low liquidity situation.\n\nBinance Releases Proof of Reserves System | Binance Support https://t.co/pdA2OdvAKG \u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) November 25, 2022\n\nAlthough hardware alternatives for crypto self-custody require an upfront investment, it is up to the users to choose an ideal method of storing the private keys, even if it means writing the private keys on a piece of paper.\n\nThe three practices mentioned above \u2014 hodl, DCA and self-custody \u2014 form the main pillars of financial freedom. However, users are not limited from trying other strategies that suit their needs.\n\nAchieving financial freedom with Bitcoin is possible. Given the nascency of the crypto ecosystem, investors are advised to focus on the long-term benefits of Bitcoin while reaping short-term gains in the process."

        "content": "Black Swan author Nassim Nicholas Taleb lashed out at Bitcoin (BTC) in a recent interview. The well-known risk analyst compared the leading cryptocurrency to \"malignant tumors\" and said it\u2019s a \"magnet for idiots.\"\n\nCredited with predicting the 2007/2008 financial crisis, Taleb, who writes about probability and risk, was once a fan of Bitcoin. He thought it could offer an alternative to centralized monetary policy at a time when he didn't agree with the Fed's decisions. But as time went on, he lost faith, as he explained in a recent interview with L'Express in France.\n\nDiscover: Best places to buy bitcoin\n\nMore: Check out our updated list of best crypto apps including one offer with a $100 crypto bonus\n\nHere are some of the reasons he now compares Bitcoin to cancer.\n\n1. It doesn't work as a currency\n\nTaleb says that Bitcoin hasn't managed to become a \"currency without government,\" in spite of the hype. He points out that it doesn't work as a store of value or guard against inflation -- two common selling points we hear from Bitcoin advocates. \"Worse than anything,\" he says, \"It does not remotely constitute a shield against government tyranny or a vehicle to protect against catastrophic episodes.\"\n\nThere are a lot of arguments around whether Bitcoin works as a currency. On the one hand, it's extremely volatile. If you're using Bitcoin to pay salaries or pay your rent, it becomes problematic if it gains or loses 50% of its value in a short space of time. It's also relatively slow in processing transactions and transaction fees can be expensive.\n\nOn the other, Bitcoin fans believe it could become the currency of the internet, or function as a form of digital gold, and say there are tech solutions that will reduce transaction times and costs. It's also been adopted by countries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic as legal tender (though there are questions about how successful those moves actually were.)\n\n2. It's part of a Disneyland-eque asset bubble\n\nTaleb believes the low interest rates we've seen in the past 15 years have distorted the way we see investments. \"Lowering rates creates asset bubbles without necessarily helping the economy,\" he argues. According to Taleb, Bitcoin has flourished in a speculative environment where people have lost any sense of what long-term investments really are. He goes further, claiming that young Bitcoiners do not understand finance. He says some young people who bought Bitcoin early \"got temporarily rich without knowing anything except computer programming.\"\n\n3. It attracts scammers\n\nThe idea that crypto is a hotbed for fraudulent activity is nothing new. Even Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said last year that the industry was suffering a black eye because of the numbers of fraudsters involved. Taleb says, \"I think the crypto universe attracts manipulators and scammers.\"\n\nBitcoin fans would argue it's not fair to slam the entire crypto industry just because Bitcoin has been used by bad actors -- in the same way that you can't you couldn't criticize the U.S. dollar because some criminals use it. Scammers have used crypto just as they would use any new technology where there are high expectations and a relatively low knowledge base. That said, the lack of regulation in terms of the functioning of individual cryptocurrencies and trading on crypto exchanges has opened the door to a disproportionate number of bad actors.\n\nIs he right?\n\nMany crypto investors have seen the value of their portfolios drop significantly in the past year, particularly those who bought for the first time during the frenzy of 2020/2021. It isn't surprising that some people regret their crypto purchases and wonder if Bitcoin still has long-term potential.\n\nThe difficulty is that nobody knows for sure. Taleb raises important questions about Bitcoin's utility, which is fundamental to its ability to do well in the coming 10 or 20 years. But the idea that it's an asset bubble or that it has attracted scammers doesn't necessarily rule out an eventual recovery.\n\nInvestors like Ark Invest's Cathie Wood still believe Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. Ark cites several industries where it could take a portion of the market -- such as the international remittance market or working as a currency in emerging markets. But it's impossible to guess at the impact of increased regulation. Regulation is just one of several hurdles that crypto needs to cross. For example, right now, crypto isn't that easy to use, which stops it reaching new users.\n\nOne thing is clear. Bitcoin remains a high-risk investment and it is important to listen to critics like Taleb as well as advocates like Wood. If you do decide to buy Bitcoin, make sure it only makes up a small percentage of your portfolio. If you only invest money you can afford to lose in high-risk assets like crypto, you won't be knocked off course financially if they eventually fail.\n\nOur picks for the best credit cards\n\nOur experts vetted the most popular offers to land on the select picks that are worthy of a spot in your wallet.
