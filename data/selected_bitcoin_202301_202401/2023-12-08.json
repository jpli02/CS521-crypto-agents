        "content": "It should be no surprise that Bitcoin sold for over $44,000 this week, more than double its March 13 price. Going back to 2014, it has taken the cryptocurrency an average of nine months and 21 days to double; the milestone came 28 days early this time.\n\nWhat is mildly surprising is that Bitcoin doubled without ever falling below its March 13 low. On average, it has dropped 27% between doublings (that is, if it starts from $1,000, it drops to $730 before trading above $2,000) and it has dropped as much as 83% (trading for $170 before going to $2,000)."

        "content": "Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block Launches \u201cBitkey\u201d Self Custody Bitcoin Wallet\n\nFinancial payment processor Block, co-founded by Jack Dorsey, has unveiled its self-custody Bitcoin wallet called \"Bitkey.\" In an announcement on December 7, developers revealed that the wallet will be available as a mobile app or hardware storage and accessible in over 95 countries.\n\nBitkey features a two-of-three multi-signature wallet, which consists of a mobile key, a hardware key, and a server key. It incorporates a secure hardware device and recovery tools in case of loss. To approve transactions, users will need to authenticate with both their fingerprint and phone. Coinbase and Cash App are among the initial global partners for Bitkey.\n\nBlock emphasized that Bitkey employs three keys to secure Bitcoin, requiring any two keys to work together for moving Bitcoin or authorizing security-related actions like recovery or modifying settings. The wallet, operating in a 2-of-3 multi-signature framework, ensures that Bitkey cannot access or move a customer's Bitcoin without their participation.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Block reported impressive financial results, recording $5.62 billion in revenue driven by strong sales growth from payment processors Cash App and Square. The company also achieved a $44 million profit on its Bitcoin investments, benefiting from the recent price recovery of BTC. Furthermore, Bitcoin transaction gross profit reached $45 million, a 22% increase year-over-year, with Block selling $2.42 billion worth of BTC to customers through Cash App.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Since its inception, Bitcoin (BTC) has been the leading light in the world of cryptocurrency. It has dominated the markets and has been the market-leading cryptocurrency by a country mile. However, since reaching the $60,000 price mark in 2021, it was on a freefall till it hit rock bottom at $20,000. The good news is it is making rapid strides again and breached the $44,000 mark on Tuesday, Dec 5.\n\nThis optimism about BTC has been centered around many top investment firms from the traditional marketplace starting to file for U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) approval of their Bitcoin ETFs. Investors are currently anticipating a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC as early as the first half of 2024. Many believe this could pave the way for a surge in institutional investment in the crypto sector.\n\nThe focus has also shifted to what the Fed's monetary policy will be in 2024. Currently, it is highly anticipated that the Fed will hold the interest rates at their current level in its Dec 13 meeting and start bringing it down sometime in first-quarter 2024. With interest rates coming down and investors getting more speculative, riskier asset classes like cryptocurrencies are well-positioned to benefit. In addition, the scheduled Bitcoin \u201chalving\u201d in April 2024 will slash the number of mined Bitcoins in what is expected to be a booming market for the benchmark crypto coin, thereby raising its price even further.\n\nAs of date, the price of the crypto behemoth has risen more than 150% in 2023 and constitutes 51.3% of the entire crypto market. Currently, it is on a steady march to cross the $50,000 level, and because of the factors mentioned above, it is expected to get further traction. In such an environment, it might be prudent to track stocks that are exposed to or directly linked to Bitcoin. Here are our choices.\n\nCboe Global Markets, Inc.

        "title": "'Number go up': bitcoin's startling surge is inexplicable as ever - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIf you ever see me, in any forum, recommending that people should buy crypto, then one of two things has happened. Either someone has created a deep fake of me, or I have been kidnapped. In the latter scenario, \u201cbuy crypto\u201d would be my secret distress signal. Call the cops.\n\nNonetheless, it is hard to ignore the startling rally in bitcoin. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried. Somehow, despite a swirling hellfire of regulatory aggression and legal strife afflicting several of the key institutions in this space, the price of this token has risen by 160 per cent this year (not a typo) to $44,000, in a rally that has accelerated sharply over the past week or so. That comfortably eclipses any traditional asset class on the planet.\n\nTo be clear, if people want to buy these tokens, I bear them no ill. People spend money on Crocs sandals, real ale and other things I don\u2019t like all the time. Similarly, taking a punt on a crypto token is just as valid as buying a lottery ticket or putting a fiver each way on the 1.40 at Kempton racecourse. Nothing wrong with that. If you want to do this, knock yourself out. I hope it makes you rich. If it does, the last laugh will be yours, so please don\u2019t bother sending the usual all-caps emails telling me I\u2019m an idiot \u2014 they\u2019ll just go in the file with the others.\n\nStill, what are the circumstances under which this works as an investment strategy? What does the price rise really mean? When the asset class is, say, stocks or bonds, investors have broadly agreed metrics and assumptions to answer those questions. But this is bitcoin. Strap in for a dizzying exercise of partially sensible but largely circular arguments that lots of reasonable people sincerely believe.\n\nZach Pandl is one of those people, who left a career in macro strategy at Goldman Sachs for a role as an analyst at Grayscale, which operates crypto investment trusts. \u201cI believe in the future of this,\u201d he says. But at the same time, \u201cI\u2019m not an ideological person here\u201d.\n\nPandl generally looks at the value of crypto tokens through the same lens as major currencies, which are broadly (and I stress broadly) determined by real interest rates and fund flows. Pandl reckons bitcoin\u2019s latest violent ascent is really down to the US Federal Reserve and the assumption it is done raising rates and may even cut them soonish. \u201cGold has noticed that, bonds have noticed that, and bitcoin has noticed that,\u201d he says. So far so plausible: the very large drop we have seen in bond yields recently boosts the relative allure of non-yielding assets like gold and crypto. But for Pandl, this is about more than just that.\n\nInstead, he says bitcoin is the only \u201cobvious competitor currency\u201d in the event that the US dollar is \u201cdebased\u201d. The euro, sterling, yen and renminbi do not, for him, pass the test. This requires you believe two things: that dollar debasement is really a thing, and that it can be replaced in its central role as the world\u2019s reserve currency by a token you cannot yet use to buy a cup of coffee. It\u2019s a stretch.\n\nApart from interest rates, another key short-term trigger often cited for bitcoin\u2019s latest rally is that the manifold well-publicised failures of crypto projects over the past year, and in particular last month\u2019s $4.3bn fine on Binance, could have been worse. My thought here is \u201capart from that, Mrs Lincoln, how was the play?\u201d But for those crypto proponents who are not in jail, the fact Binance still exists at all is a positive.\n\nThe big one though is investor demand. I am yet to meet a single chief investment officer or portfolio manager at any institutional money manager who has any interest in bitcoin. Boosters insist bitcoin is bringing in this kind of money, but beyond a few hedge funds, venture capital firms and family offices, the evidence for this is scant at best. Wealthy individuals are probably aware of bitcoin\u2019s latest leap, but even there, sector advisers are sceptical. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing more demand from the client side,\u201d said Christian Nolting, chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. \u201cI have enough volatility on the bonds side, I don\u2019t need crypto for the vol,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is possible that if US regulators approve the launch of cash bitcoin exchange traded funds by institutions such as BlackRock, that might tempt more investors to seek exposure to crypto through them. This could, potentially, really be a breakthrough moment but the true demand is yet to be seen and it could already be priced in.\n\nThis is just one of the contradictory arguments here, though. At the same time, we are told crypto is up because sovereign citizens want to avoid government and regulatory intrusion, and it is up because it may be about to gain greater regulatory oversight. It is apparently simultaneously a bet on inflation falling, and a hedge against inflation rising. It is a currency, but also a speculative asset.\n\nThese things can\u2019t all be true at the same time. The fact is, different people buy crypto for all of these different reasons and more, contradictions be damned. The only thing the latest price rise tells you is that an unknown number of people are buying this illiquid token more enthusiastically than they were before. Number go up.\n\nkatie.martin@ft.com"

        "title": "Bitcoin's unlikely resurgence: bulls bet on Wall Street adoption - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nBitcoin is booming again, just weeks after the downfall of two of the industry\u2019s biggest names. Bulls are hoping the prosecutions draw a line under the sector\u2019s troubled past and will allow it to tap billions of dollars of cash from Wall Street.\n\nThe price of the most actively traded cryptocurrency has soared about 160 per cent this year to a 20-month high of $44,000, leading the charge among digital tokens as the gloomy sentiment that has hung over the market fades and traders pile back in.\n\nIt comes only weeks after the US successfully secured criminal prosecutions against Changpeng Zhao and Sam Bankman-Fried, the former chiefs of the Binance and FTX exchanges respectively and two of the biggest names associated with the bubble market of 2020-21.\n\nSpeculators are now betting that the toughest regulatory punishments have passed and bitcoin will be embraced by large global fund managers and investment banks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at the two biggest guys in crypto potentially both going to jail and yet crypto goes on . . the old guard is being replaced by fresh money,\u201d said Ed Hindi, chief investment officer at investment management firm Tyr Capital.\n\n\u201cEverything has been thrown at bitcoin and it\u2019s held up, whether you like it or not, it\u2019s going to command a place in portfolios.\u201d\n\nThe surge in bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, comes as investors place bets on growth stocks and riskier assets in anticipation that central banks will begin cutting interest rates next year.\n\nCK Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, said Fed rate cuts were just \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d. \u201cThe fundamentals of the bitcoin price are driven by the introduction of highly regulated companies into the market. Wall Street is coming to adopt crypto,\u201d he added.\n\nThe crypto market, known for its booms and busts, has a particular spring in its step after 20 months of negative headlines and painful declines. From a peak of just over $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin had slumped in value by three quarters to just $16,000 at the start of this year.\n\nIts steady recovery this year gained momentum in November, particularly after US authorities fined Binance $4.3bn for breaching money laundering and financial sanctions. Crucially, it did not shut down the world\u2019s most influential crypto exchange.\n\nThat decision has helped draw out the crypto bulls. This week El Salvador\u2019s authoritarian president Nayib Bukele, under whom bitcoin became legal tender in 2021, triumphantly posted on social media site X that the country\u2019s holdings of the digital currency were back in profit. Meanwhile, Brian Armstrong, chief executive of US exchange Coinbase, said he had been contemplating how bitcoin \u201cmay be the key to extending western civilisation\u201d.\n\nSome even see the beginning of a new supercycle. Bernstein, the US investment bank, last month predicted bitcoin could more than treble in value to $150,000 by 2025.\n\nKey to the optimism is approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission for exchange traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe market has long viewed a spot bitcoin ETF as a way to tap US retail investors, with a cheap but safe and regulated investment product. For a decade the SEC has resisted all applications, arguing bitcoin prices are set on unregulated exchanges and so it cannot give adequate investor protections.\n\nBut pressure has been growing on the SEC since it lost a court ruling last summer on its reasons for blocking an ETF application by asset management firm Grayscale. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are among the well-known names that have filed applications, raising hopes they can bring vast numbers of US retail investors to crypto. A decision from the SEC could come as soon as next month.\n\n\u201cJust improving market access shouldn\u2019t really buoy prices, but I think it does because it\u2019s an explicit nod from the SEC that they approve of bitcoin, at least in some respects,\u201d said James Butterfill, head of research at investment group CoinShares.\n\nMany investors have already bought cryptocurrencies in anticipation that demand will continue to grow. According to data from CoinShares, there have been 10 consecutive weeks of inflows into digital assets products, a wave of investment that came shortly after Grayscale\u2019s court victory over the SEC.\n\nSpeculators hope US regulators\u2019 acceptance of bitcoin ETFs will provide more durable support to prices, in contrast to previous bitcoin rallies, such as 2013, 2017 and 2021, when prices surged quickly only to collapse just as violently.\n\n\u201cThis will be the first time there could be true recognition of bitcoin . . . I do think this signifies that, this time, the rally will be more sustained,\u201d Butterfill added.\n\nOptimists also point to a technical change in the production of bitcoin that, they argue, will sustain demand. In April next year the number of bitcoin that miners receive for verifying cryptocurrency transactions will halve, with the aim of reducing the supply of fresh bitcoins on the market.\n\n\u201cThis will be a very strong technical driver for the price of bitcoin as mining becomes more difficult and less profitable, and scarcity continues to increase,\u201d said Tim Frost, chief executive of Yield App, a crypto platform that offers customers yields on digital assets.\n\nIn spite of the renewed confidence, some doubts linger over the durability of bitcoin\u2019s rally. Two of the US\u2019s largest ETF providers, Vanguard and State Street, have not filed to list a spot bitcoin ETF. State Street told Financial News in the summer that \u201cthere was no investment case for crypto\u201d.\n\nUS authorities have said that scrutiny on illicit behaviour in sub-sectors such as the stablecoin market will continue next year.\n\nThe SEC has outstanding cases against Binance and US-listed Coinbase, alleging both marketplaces were unregistered exchanges and sold unregistered securities. Victories for the SEC could force many of them to register with the regulator and impose tougher surveillance and transparency on their markets.\n\nSome industry insiders also doubt that the SEC will break the habit of a lifetime and approve a bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nDavid Mercer, chief executive of LMAX Group, a currency trading venue, said that SEC approval of an ETF was already priced into the market but added that the bigger goal was turning traditional assets such as securities into digital tokens.\n\n\u201cThe end game is most of traditional finance being enabled by blockchain in the decades to come, so from that perspective, we\u2019re just at the start,\u201d he added.\n\nBut after months of negative headlines and a barrage of enforcement actions, some hope the rally can merely mark a break from the past, rather than kick-starting another bull run.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on breaking out of this orbit we\u2019ve been locked in the last 18 months rather than some astronomical price spike,\u201d said Michael Safai, co-founder of trading firm Dexterity Capital. \u201cThose days are over, or they should be,\u201d Safai added."
