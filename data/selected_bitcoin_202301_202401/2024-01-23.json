        "content": "The price of the cryptocurrency was last lower by nearly 2% at $39,362.00, trimming earlier losses but still adding to its 4% decline from the previous day .\n\nBitcoin extended its recent declines on Tuesday, falling further below $40,000 to its lowest level since the beginning of December.\n\nSome have pointed to short-term selling pressure from exits from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has seen about $2 billion in outflows since Jan. 19 while BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund have each seen more than $1 billion in inflow.\n\n\"The outflow from GBTC should not matter that much as bitcoin's inflow into other ETFs have offset the outflow by $1.2 billion so far,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank. \"It seems that the seemingly large amount of daily outflows from GBTC is affecting the market in a psychological way.\"\n\nInvestors have been waiting out this correction, which was expected by many as a \"sell the news\" phenomenon following the well-telegraphed approval of bitcoin ETFs. Expectations around the event emerged last summer intensified in August, pushing the bitcoin price steadily higher.\n\nNow, traders are sitting on large unrealized profits and analysts say bitcoin's price has a long way to fall before reversing higher. In the near term, $36,000 is the support level to watch, chart analysts have said. Still, chart experts say a new all-time high for bitcoin is still in sight for this year.\n\nThe move in bitcoin continued to pull the rest of the crypto market lower. Ether , fell 7% to $2,170.55. Solana slid 7% along with the token tied to decentralized finance protocol Uniswap. Ripple's XRP fell 5% and dogecoin lost 6%.\n\nCrypto-related equities were under pressure as well. Microstrategy , which has long traded as a proxy for the bitcoin price, lost 4%, while the biggest miners, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms , each fell about 2%. Coinbase slipped 4%, in part due to a downgrade by JPMorgan, which cited concerns of crypto rally fizzle.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "title": "Bitcoin's 20% Post-ETF Slide Threatens Exchange-Traded FOMO - Bloomberg",
        "content": "It can seem silly to apply some traditional market terminology to crypto, such as when a \u201cbear market\u201d is declared because an asset or index has fallen 20% from a recent peak. Historically, a move like that is enough to mark a big regime shift in the stock market, but just another day in the office for the volatile world of crypto trading.\n\n\n\nYet the latest 20% drop in Bitcoin from its recent high is worth some scrutiny. In fact, it could be the most-scrutinized dip of that size in recent memory, given how much hype accompanied the run-up to the launch of exchange-traded funds that invest direct in the original cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nThere are an assortment of reasons being offered for the drop, including the old standby clich\u00e9 of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d when it comes to ETFs, and some of the usual macro suspects: Interest rates have crept higher in the new year, so has the dollar. Even the ghost of FTX is in the mix! The bankrupt exchange\u2019s estate has been dumping its position in the newly converted Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, and those outflows are destined to be used to pay off creditors rather than recycled into competing Bitcoin ETFs with lower fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of what catalysts caused the 20% drop, the key question now is whether the tumble itself will prove to be its own catalyst to frost over the green candles that seemed to have been marking the end of the latest crypto winter. Let\u2019s face it, FOMO \u2013 fear of missing out \u2013 has always been one of the most important drivers in crypto moonshots.\n\n\n\nA recent survey by Deutsche Bank showed that more than one-third of respondents expect Bitcoin to drop below $20,000 by year end, and most consumers expressed concern about the potential collapse of a major cryptocurrency by 2026.\n\n\n\nIn other words, missing out is not exactly the main fear these days in the post-FTX crypto landscape, regardless of how much cheaper, safer and more-convenient the ETFs make it to gain exposure to Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nSo for the moment, all the breathless predictions that the launch of the ETFs would send Bitcoin to a new record high \u2013 or even to $100,000, as some forecast \u2013 seem a little suspect.\n\n\n\nBut after all, tomorrow is another day and the Bitcoin hype machine is poised to pivot to a new talking point: The upcoming halving, when supply of new tokens gets cut in half. How much that\u2019s able to get the FOMO juices flowing again could be the ultimate near-term test of the potential demand for the new ETFs."

        "title": "Bitcoin price falls 15% following launch of ETFs - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nBitcoin has lost 15 per cent of its value over the past two weeks, as some investors use the much-hyped launch of bitcoin exchange traded funds earlier this month to take profits and exit their holdings of the volatile cryptocurrency.\n\nThe price of bitcoin sank as much as 3 per cent on Tuesday, dipping below $39,000 for the first time since early December, before recovering slightly in afternoon trading.\n\nThe recent losses have unwound part of a huge rally late last year, which came amid fevered speculation that the launch of mainstream stock market funds tracking the world\u2019s leading crypto token would draw in new investors to bitcoin.\n\nBut the flows into the ETFs \u2014 many launched by big Wall Street players such as BlackRock \u2014 have underwhelmed and investors who bought them have been left with hefty losses.\n\nThe 10 new funds launched on January 11, after they were approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, had collectively pulled in $4.7bn by the end of Tuesday, according to crypto investment group CoinShares. Bitcoin traded at $46,100 on the day the ETFs were launched, but has fallen steadily since.\n\nAt the same time, $3.4bn has left Grayscale\u2019s fund, the world\u2019s largest bitcoin investment vehicle, since it converted to an ETF alongside the new launches.\n\nAnalysts think much of the money in the 10 new funds is likely to have come from investors exiting Grayscale, which charges much higher fees than its competitors.\n\n\u201cWhat people didn\u2019t realise is that you would have an enormous exit from Grayscale,\u201d said Douglas Comin, a senior crypto options trader at XBTO. \u201cIf you scratch the surface, you see that most inflows are not new money, it\u2019s just investors moving from Grayscale to another ETF.\n\n\u201cThese ETFs were super highly anticipated, and now we see that [a bitcoin bull run] is not going to materialise, at least not as quickly as the market wanted,\u201d he added.\n\nThe conversion of Grayscale\u2019s 10-year-old bitcoin trust has allowed some of its investors \u2014 who have for years only been able to sell shares in the trust at a large discount to the price of bitcoin \u2014 to exit their holdings altogether. The fund\u2019s overall size has fallen from $28bn earlier this month to $22bn by close of trading on Monday.\n\n\u201cETFs bring liquidity, and while they enable people to come in, they also enable people to exit,\u201d said Varun Paul, director of market infrastructure at blockchain platform Fireblocks. \u201cSome investors are exiting positions after buying bitcoin a long time ago, so they\u2019re in the money.\u201d\n\nGrayscale reduced its 2 per cent management fee to 1.5 per cent as it prepared to launch its ETF, but that rate remains considerably more expensive than its competitors.\n\nIn contrast, BlackRock charges just 0.12 per cent. However, that figure will rise to 0.25 per cent in the next year if its ETF pulls in $5bn in assets under management. The US group has drawn in $1.7bn to date."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Etherium Fell Today - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Several major cryptocurrencies slumped on Tuesday as investors grappled with the implications over capital inflows to the crypto market following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) landmark approvals of the first spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) almost two weeks ago on Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nWhen all was said and done during today's regular trading session, the price of Bitcoin had fallen 2.2%, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) was down 6.4%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) had declined 5.9%.\n\nCompany card for Bitcoin CRYPTO:BTC\n\nExcitement is waning for spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, in particular, has declined around 20% from its post-ETF approval highs of around $49,000 as the excitement surrounding the approvals has seemed to wane. That marked a three-year high on Jan. 11, the day after the SEC's formal approval of 11 competing spot Bitcoin ETFs hit the wires.\n\nTo be fair, Bitcoin is also still up more than 70% over the past year. The bulk of that gain came in a multi-month rally that began in Oct. 2023 after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's ruling in August that prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nMany investors considered this a huge deal for the cryptocurrency market in general. ETFs are a much more accessible medium for investors putting their capital to work in cryptocurrency assets, after all, compared to setting up separate crypto accounts or wallets with a crypto-specific broker. ETF shares can be bought and sold throughout the normal trading day through virtually any broker, similar to how retail investors can easily buy and sell publicly traded stocks.\n\nCrypto-industry watchers also mused that once the first spot Bitcoin ETFs were finally approved, it would not only serve as validation for crypto assets as a mainstream investment medium but could also present an enormous windfall for ETF providers as capital surged into crypto assets. According to research from data analytics firm CryptoQuant, the capital influx stemming from spot Bitcoin ETFs has the potential to increase the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization by a total of more than $1 trillion over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is more than a simple \"sell the news\" event\n\nWhile some investors are undoubtedly taking their quick crypto profits off the table given the massive rally, I think this situation is more than a simple \"sell the news\" event.\n\nAccording to a report from digital asset manager CoinShares this morning, for example, crypto funds saw inflows of \"only\" $1.25 billion in the first week after the launch of the first Bitcoin ETFs. That influx turned to an outflow of $21 million last week, however, as some large institutional investors took advantage of the rally to pare their own positions.\n\nBut even that surprising news requires more perspective. As Bloomberg Intelligence's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on X this week, the outflows have been primarily fueled by more than $2.2 billion in withdrawals from Grayscale's spot bitcoin ETF alone. Among those large sellers was the estate of former cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which liquidated around $1 billion of its holdings as part of its bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThat could signal a light at the end of this tunnel for crypto bulls, however. There's certainly plenty of work to be done for the cryptocurrency market to gain true acceptance as a mainstream investment option. But it's also not exactly common to see a bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange liquidating its massive positions on the heels of what otherwise should have represented a watershed moment for the crypto asset class.\n\n\n\nOnce the dust settles surrounding the recent spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, I won't be the least bit surprised if the crypto market's outflows turn back to inflows as more investors begin dipping their toes into the crypto pool. If that happens, this pause in Bitcoin's rally might just prove to be short-lived.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.
