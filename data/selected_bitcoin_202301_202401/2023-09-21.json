        "content": "This month\u2019s steep decline in Bitcoin trading volume on Binance is likely tied in part to the end of another zero-fee promotion by the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe seven-day average volume has dropped by 26% since the start of September, according to researcher CCData. On Sept. 7, the exchange halted an incentive that allowed customers to trade between Bitcoin and the TrueUSD stablecoin without a fee. The seven-day average volume for that so-called trading pair has dropped 89% since the inducement expired."

        "title": "The Evolution of Bitcoin Wallets: From the Early Days to Today's Modern Solutions - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Since its conception in 2009, Bitcoin, a revolutionary digital money, has advanced significantly. The development of Bitcoin wallets has been astounding along with the rise of Bitcoin. It has been a wonderful journey from simple solutions to the sophisticated and feature-rich wallets we have today. We'll go into the fascinating past of Bitcoin wallets in this post, and we'll also look at how they've changed to accommodate the demands of modern cryptocurrency fans.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nSince the beginning of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin wallets have seen tremendous development.\n\nModern systems now provide improved convenience, security, and user-friendly features.\n\nUsers may choose a wallet with more knowledge if they are aware of the evolution of Bitcoin wallets.\n\nBitcoin Wallet: A Private Digital Safe\n\nPhoto by DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash\n\nLet's first define a Bitcoin wallet before starting our time travel adventure. A Bitcoin wallet is a software program or physical object that enables users to securely store, transmit, and receive bitcoin. Your private keys, which are necessary for accessing your Bitcoin assets, are stored in it as a virtual vault. It would be nearly difficult to conduct Bitcoin transactions without a wallet.\n\nFun fact: Did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic person who invented Bitcoin, carried out the first transaction? On January 12, 2009, he gave developer Hal Finney 10 bitcoins, thus launching the cryptocurrency.\n\nPaper Wallets and Simple Software Wallets in the Beginning\n\nSecurity was a major issue in the early days of Bitcoin. To store their private and public keys, users depended on paper wallets, which were simply printouts. The keys were stored offline, away from any online threats, in these paper wallets, making them safe. They were inconvenient, though, because each transaction needed human key input.\n\nInteresting fact: On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz created history by carrying out the first Bitcoin transaction in the real world. He spent 10,000 bitcoins, or millions of dollars in today's currency, to buy two pizzas.\n\n\n\nBasic software wallets soon followed, offering a more user-friendly interface. Users could easily manage their Bitcoin on their PCs with the help of these wallets, which were easy to install. To avoid data loss, they needed to be constantly backed up and were susceptible to virus assaults.\n\nMobile Wallets: Access to Bitcoin Anywhere\n\nPhoto by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash\n\nWith the popularity of smartphones, Bitcoin wallets appeared on portable electronics, enabling users to carry their digital assets with them wherever they went. Mobile wallets made using Bitcoin more convenient and opened the door for regular transactions.\n\nFun fact: In 2013, James Howells, a programmer, mistakenly threw away a hard drive containing his Bitcoin wallet. The hard disk was eventually dumped in a landfill, where it is still today. Over 7,500 bitcoins, worth millions of dollars, are thought to be in the misplaced wallet.\n\nAccessing Bitcoin Anywhere, Anytime with Web Wallets\n\nThe ability to access money from any internet-connected device thanks to web wallets transformed the Bitcoin experience. Users no longer had to bother about backups or install software. They may use a web browser to safely access their Bitcoin, making it simpler for beginners to enter the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nInteresting fact: In 2014, Mt. Gox, previously the biggest Bitcoin exchange, experienced a significant security breach that cost the company around 850,000 bitcoins. The significance of security precautions in safeguarding Bitcoin wallets was brought home by this occurrence.\n\nHardware Wallets: The Bitcoin Fort Knox\n\nHardware wallets became the most safe choice as Bitcoin's value skyrocketed and security worries multiplied. These tangible objects protect private keys from potential internet attacks by storing them offline. Hardware wallets offer an additional degree of security for your Bitcoin by being resistant to hacker attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFun fact: By the end of 2020, more than 1.5 million pieces of the Ledger Nano S, one of the most popular hardware wallets, had been sold.\n\nFeature-Rich and User-Friendly Modern\n\nSolutionsPhoto by Shubham Dhage on Unsplash\n\n\n\nBitcoin wallets have become sophisticated, feature-rich solutions in modern times. They provide seamless exchange integration, support for several currencies, biometric identification, and improved user interfaces. Some wallets even let users to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and earn interest on their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom its inception to the present, Bitcoin wallets have had an amazing journey. Wallets have improved in security, practicality, and use with each new development. It's important to keep in mind, though, that in the end, it's your obligation to protect your Bitcoin. To guarantee the safety of your digital riches, keep educated, follow best practices, and select a wallet that fits your demands. Wallets are incredibly important in the fascinating world of Bitcoin. Your Bitcoin adventure awaits, whether you choose a stylish mobile wallet or the strong security of a hardware wallet.\n\nThis is a guest post by Ethan Reed.

        "title": "2 'Strong Buy' Bitcoin Stocks Under $5 With Triple-Digit Upside Potential - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Since coming on the scene, cryptocurrencies have fired the imaginations of online traders, currency speculators, and mathematicians alike. The leading digital currency, bitcoin, is currently priced at approximately $26,550 per coin, representing a ~60% increase year-to-date. And it looks like bitcoin will see a strong upward pressure on that price over the next year.\n\nThe bitcoin algorithm has a built-in halving mechanism, whereby the reward given to miners for solving a blockchain link is cut in half. The process takes place about every four years, and is next expected in May of 2024. The bitcoin halving has happened regularly since 2012, and has historically had a positive effect on the digital currency\u2019s price, as well as on the share prices of bitcoin-related stocks.\n\nThat last gives investors a chance to get in early. The predictability and regularity of the bitcoin halving makes now the right time to start looking into bitcoin stocks, to find an attractive point of entry well before this catalyst takes place. Wall Street\u2019s analysts can help with this; they\u2019ve been pointing out solid choices among the bitcoin mining companies, anticipating a rise in price.\n\nA quick look at the TipRanks data shows that their latest picks have several common attributes that should bring in investors. We\u2019ll look at two bitcoin mining stocks, each currently priced under $5 per share, and boasting a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 consensus rating. Additionally, some are projecting triple-digit upside potential for the coming year. Here are the details.\n\nBitfarms (BITF)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Bitfarms, a bitcoin mining company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, and operating with 11 bitcoin mining facilities \u2013 farms, as the company calls them \u2013 located in 4 countries. The company has approximately 56,200 mining rigs deployed. Bitfarms can boast a hashrate of 5.6 EH/s, and generates an average of 12.4 bitcoins per day.\n\nBitcoin mining won\u2019t happen without power, and bitcoin miners also operate the large-scale power generation facilities needed to support their data center operations. Bitfarms has 240 megawatts of power generation planned, and this past August the company announced the start of a 50 megawatt deployment plan, located in Paraguay, for the generation of hydroelectric power. The plan is the first phase from a set of contracts totaling 150 megawatts in hydropower development. The current phase is located near Bitfarms\u2019 existing Paraguay facility, and is expected to go online in 1Q24.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Bitfarms is expanding its Argentina operations. The company added 3,150 modern mining rigs to its Rio Cuarto facility, and has planned deliveries for another 1,068 rigs, scheduled for installation this month.\n\nBitfarms\u2019 activity to expand its power generation and farming network is bringing results. The company\u2019s 2Q23 financial report showed that the company mined 1,223 bitcoins during the quarter, and its hashrate, as of June 30, was up 10% from Q1 and stood at 5.3 EH/s. That hashrate alone shows one measure of the company\u2019s expansion \u2013 two months later, in August, the hashrate was up to 5.6 EH/s. The company has targeted a 7.0 EH/s hashrate for the first quarter of next year.\n\nIn a recent update for August\u2019s production numbers, Bitfarms reported mining 383 bitcoins during the month. This was up from 378 mined in July, although it was down from 534 bitcoins generated in August of last year. The 383 figure was in-line with Bitfarms\u2019 monthly production during the first 8 months of this year \u2013 and the year-to-date total of 3,281 bitcoins is higher than the equivalent figure, 3,252, from last year. Of the bitcoins mined in August, Bitfarms sold off 323, generating $9 million in total proceeds. The remaining 60 bitcoins were added to the company\u2019s treasury, increasing its holding to 654 bitcoins. Bitfarms valued this holding at $17.8 million, based on the August 31 price.\n\nAccording to Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Josh Siegler, Bitfarms has plenty of strength as it heads into next year, which investors might be overlooking right now. He writes, \u201cWe continue to believe the Bitfarms story may be under-appreciated by investors. The company has demonstrated substantial progress in establishing a clear line-of-sight for near-term growth and improving its cash expenses, in our view. With a strong balance sheet and higher visibility to energizing Argentina, we believe BITF may be unfairly receiving a discount on its valuation relative to peers. If Bitfarms achieves its near-term hash target \u2026 while demonstrating improved free cash flow and unit economics, we believe there may be significant upside to the stock price.\u201d\n\nSignificant upside, indeed. Along with an Overweight (Buy) rating on the shares, Seigler\u2019s $3 price target implies a robust upside potential of 168% for the next 12 months. (To watch Siegler\u2019s track record, click here.)\n\nThe Street would appear to be in agreement, as all 3 of the recent analyst reviews are positive, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently priced at $1.12, and the average price target of $3.67 is even more bullish than Siegler\u2019s, indicating potential for a 228% gain over the coming year. (See Bitfarms\u2019 stock forecast.)\n\nCipher Mining (CIFR)\n\nNext up is Cipher Mining, another growing concern in the bitcoin mining industry. Cipher is a US-based firm currently in the process of building out its primary mining facility, in Odessa, Texas, which came online in November of last year. The facility is scheduled to reach completion before the end of this quarter, which will bring Cipher\u2019s total bitcoin mining hashrate to 7.2 EH/s. The company reported a total hashrate of 6.8 EH/s as of the end of 2Q23.\n\nCipher has two additional mining facilities, both wind-powered, located in Alborz, Texas and Bear and Chief, Texas. These sites can operate at 40 and 20 megawatts respectively. Among its three active sites, the company has 68,000 miners deployed, and at the end of August this year had a potential capacity to mine as many as 16.1 bitcoins per day.\n\nIn the firm\u2019s most recent production update, for August of this year, Cipher reported mining a total of 357 bitcoins. This was down 15% month-over-month, and after sales of 355 bitcoin, the company had an account balance of 519 bitcoin available. At an estimated price of $27,000 per bitcoin, this holding is worth over $14 million. Cipher management reports that the company is on track to meet its current expansion and production goals.\n\nWhile Cipher\u2019s core business is bitcoin mining, the company is also building out its power generation capacity \u2013 and that has caught the attention of BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis. He sees the company\u2019s potential as a net-seller of electricity as a clear benefit, complementing the firm\u2019s success at entering low-cost power contracts, and writes, \u201cThe company has a very low-cost fixed-price power purchase agreement at ~$0.027/kWh (expires 2027) with the ability to opportunistically sell electricity back to the grid. Cipher has one of the lowest cost structures in the BTC mining industry creating attractive unit economics allowing the business to operate through the cycle. In the near term, Cipher\u2019s core business should remain BTC mining, but longer term we see the opportunity to become a more integrated player in the energy-generation space.\u201d\n\nTaking this forward, Lewis puts a Buy rating on CIFR, and his $6 price target points toward a potential one-year gain of 124% for the stock. (To watch Lewis\u2019 track record, click here.)\n\nThe analyst consensus view on Cipher is unanimous, a Strong Buy based on 6 positive ratings set over the past 3 months. The stock has a $5.25 average price target, suggesting a 96% increase from the current share price of $2.68. (See Cipher\u2019s stock forecast.)\n\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.
