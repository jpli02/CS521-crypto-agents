Bitcoin has surged by more than 80% in 2023 but is still more than 50% below its all-time high in November 2021.\n\nU.S. investors currently have access to bitcoin futures ETFs, which invest in bitcoin futures contracts, or agreements to buy or sell the asset later for an agreed-upon price. The long-awaited bitcoin spot ETF, however, would invest in the digital currency directly.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nAmazon Prime Day 2023: How to snag the best deals\n\nTaxpayer experience this year 'vastly improved' vis-a-vis 2022\n\nTeenagers are set to experience a summer hiring boom\n\n\"I think the spot bitcoin ETF is a watershed moment for bitcoin,\" said Douglas Boneparth, a New York-based certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth.

        "content": "Alyssa Blackburn, a data scientist at Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, has spent several years performing digital detective work with her trusty lab assistant, Hail Mary, a shiny black computer with orange trim. She has been collecting and analyzing leaks from the Bitcoin blockchain, the immutable public ledger that has recorded all transactions since the cryptocurrency\u2019s launch in January 2009.\n\nBitcoin represents a techno-utopian dream. Satoshi Nakamoto, its pseudonymous inventor, proposed that the world run not on centralized financial institutions but on an egalitarian, math-based electronic money system distributed through a computer network. And the system would be \u201ctrustless\u201d \u2014 that is, it would not rely on a trusted party, such as a bank or government, to arbitrate transactions. Rather, as Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in a 2008 white paper, the system would be anchored in \u201ccryptographic proof instead of trust.\u201d Or, as T-shirts proclaim: \u201cIn Code We Trust.\u201d\n\nThe practicalities have proved complicated. Price turbulence is enough to induce the Bitcoin bends, and the system is environmentally destructive, since the computational network uses exorbitant amounts of electricity.\n\nMs. Blackburn said her project was agnostic to Bitcoin\u2019s pros and cons. Her goal was to pierce the scrim of anonymity, track the transaction flow from Day 1 and study how the world\u2019s largest cryptoeconomy emerged."
