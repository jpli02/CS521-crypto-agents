        "title": "Why Bitcoin Miners Made $6 Billion Less in 2022? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, closed last year with a loss of more than 60%. Additionally, the mining industry suffered from BTC's sharp price declines, with revenues falling 37.5% in 2022 to $9.55 billion.\n\nBitcoin Miners' Revenue Took a Dive in 2022\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, mining revenues stood at $15.3 billion in 2021. However, the high-profile collapse of the TerraUSD ecosystem in May and the FTX crypto exchange in November negatively affected the industry as a whole.\n\nMoreover, rising interest rates worldwide have increased pressure on risk assets, including equities. Cryptocurrencies, which are highly correlated with the stock market, have also begun to lose, negatively affecting the condition of digital assets mining companies.\n\nThe miners' daily revenue index reached a record high of $63 million in November 2021. However, by the end of 2022, it was at only $16 million, recording a very dynamic depreciation.\n\nKeep Reading OKX Joins Growing List of Crypto Exchanges with Singapore's MPI License\n\nDoug Brooks\n\nAccording to Doug Brooks, a Senior Advisor at XinFin Foundation, there are three main drivers for the strong decline in revenues: large increase in energy prices, lower value of Proof of Work currencies like Bitcoin and rising competition.\n\n\"There are more miners than ever now, some are even publicly listed companies, so there is less bounty for each miner since the pot size is limited,\" Brooks commented.\n\nBTC Miners' Debts Grow\n\nAs revenues and profitability declined, Bitcoin miners found it increasingly difficult to repay their liabilities. According to Luxor data, the debt-to-equity ratio has tripled for many popular and publicly listed mining companies.\n\nFor Core Scientific, one of the BTC miners from Wall Street, the ratio reached 26.7. In addition, Argo Blockchain (NASDAQ:ARBK), one of the world's largest miners, increased its debt, with the debt-to-equity ratio jumping to 8.7.\n\nBTC Miners Dept-to-Equity Rartio\n\nCore Scientific was $1.3 billion in debt as of 30 September 2022, ultimately leading to a bankruptcy filing. On the other hand, Greenidge and Stronghold decided to restructure their current liabilities. The total debt among the ten miners analyzed by Luxor reached nearly $3.5 billion.\n\nWill 2023 bring more debt and bankruptcies? According to Brooks, it \"can most certainly be expected in the mining industry this year, particularly if the prices of BTC and other PoW-based currencies drop even further.\"\n\n\"Any significant reduction in energy prices is not apparent and conversion to a more sustainable and cost-effective energy source, where possible, would take time and be costly. Many miners are already operating near or below break-even levels, so their survival until any significant price bounce must be in doubt. Any further increase in cost or reductions in revenues will accelerate the shutting down of those in the weakest positions,\" Brooks added.\n\nSignificant Losses of Bitcoin Mining Companies\n\nAlthough the largest publicly traded mining companies have not yet released their reports for the fourth quarter and the entire year of 2022, the most recent trading updates and third-quarter reports showed a significant deterioration in the industry's health.\n\nCanaan Inc. (NASDAQ:CAN), a cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturer, reported a significant drop in revenue and net income in November. During the three-month period that ended on 30 September 2022, the computing solutions provider achieved a revenue of $137.5 million, which is 26% lower than in 2021. On top of that, net income slid 90% quarter-over-quarter to $8.6 million.\n\nBitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF), a cryptocurrency mining company, reported a decline in revenue in the same quarter, despite rising BTC production. The company mined 1,515 BTC in the third quarter, nearly 500 more than a year earlier.\n\nArgo Blockchain found itself on the brink of bankruptcy Bankruptcy Bankruptcy or insolvency constitutes a legal term and refers to being unable to repay debts. A business and a person can declare bankruptcy. When a person or company claims bankruptcy, it is described as a voluntary bankruptcy, and when your debtors force you into bankruptcy, it is referred to as involuntary.

It clearly shows that despite the harsh conditions, the industry's competition has constantly been increasing.\n\nBitcoin Network Mining Difficulty\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, it took 24 trillion hashes (TH) to generate a brand new Bitcoin, while 12 months later, the indicator reached a new all-time high of 37 TH. Since then, the difficulty of mining has decreased slightly to 35 TH but remains in the range of record highs."

        "title": "How to Invest in Bitcoin - Acorns",
        "content": "Bitcoin \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency that first came onto the scene in 2009, and is now one of the largest and best-known digital currencies \u2014 frequently makes headlines with its high volatility.\n\nEven with the dramatic ups and downs that Bitcoin investors weather, buying a piece of the virtual asset is one way to diversify a portfolio. Diversification involves mixing up your investments so that you have a variety of different assets in your portfolio. If you experience losses in one area of your portfolio, gains in other areas can help cushion the blow.\n\nCryptocurrency isn\u2019t the only way to diversify your portfolio, and it\u2019s important to know the pros and cons before getting started. Let\u2019s take a look at how investing in Bitcoin works so you can decide if it\u2019s the right investment for you.\n\nHow does Bitcoin work?\n\nCryptocurrency isn\u2019t issued or backed by a government entity the way the currencies like the U.S. dollar or the euro are. Digital currency is completely decentralized and doesn\u2019t rely on a central bank. Instead, it runs on blockchain technology.\n\nThis is a database that\u2019s managed by a huge computer network. Bitcoin transactions are processed together as a block and added to the database. It\u2019s a permanent record that can\u2019t be edited. If you buy or sell Bitcoin at any time, it will be visible on the blockchain.\n\nThis technology also allows for secure payments between buyers and sellers \u2014 no bank or other third party is necessary, and you don\u2019t need to divulge any personal information. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your cryptocurrency investments are \u201csafe,\u201d though \u2014 there are still risks, like volatility, potential hackers, and even exchange collapse (more on that later). And cryptocurrency is not FDIC insured.\n\n3 ways to invest in Bitcoin\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in investing in Bitcoin, there are several ways to go about it, with pros and cons for each.\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nAn ETF is a basket of investments that trades like a stock. It typically tracks a market index, such as the S&P 500, and allows investors to buy a variety of securities (a term that just means types of investments you can buy and sell). What\u2019s more, ETFs can provide built-in diversification at a relatively low cost.\n\nSome ETFs carve out space for cryptocurrencies. With Acorns, for example, you can choose to allocate up to 5% of your portfolio in a Bitcoin-linked ETF. Instead of investing directly in Bitcoin, it invests in Bitcoin futures. This gives you some exposure to Bitcoin by investing in its potential value, without actually having to own a piece of the cryptocurrency itself. That\u2019s important given cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility and the other potential risks of investing directly in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin trading platforms\n\nYou can also invest in Bitcoin by buying individual coins, or pieces of coins, through cryptocurrency exchanges. Some recognizable names include Binance, OKX, and Coinbase. Some areas have Bitcoin ATMs that allow you to buy bitcoin with a credit card or cash.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know that cryptocurrency trading platforms have been in the headlines recently as several large exchanges have collapsed. Investors who use an exchange that collapses are at risk of losing their money.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve bought a piece of Bitcoin, you store it in a digital wallet. Each exchange typically offers its own crypto wallet. There are two different kinds of wallets: \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d wallets.\n\nHot wallets are connected to the internet and accessed through your phone, but can come with security risks. If a hacker gains access to your wallet, or the exchange your wallet is connected to collapses, your Bitcoin could be lost for good.\n\nA cold wallet, on the other hand, isn\u2019t connected to the internet. An external flash drive or hardware wallet are good examples of cold wallets. Cold wallets can be more secure, though accessing your Bitcoin may feel more cumbersome, and it\u2019s possible to misplace it because it\u2019s a physical item.\n\nTo access your wallet, you use a pair of virtual keys. A public key receives transactions, and a private key accesses your Bitcoin and proves your ownership. It\u2019s the only way you can retrieve your digital assets. If you lose it, there\u2019s no password recovery function to get it back, and if someone steals it, they could access your Bitcoin and transfer it elsewhere.\n\nBitcoin-related stocks\n\nAnother way to get Bitcoin exposure in your portfolio is by investing in Bitcoin-related companies that are publicly traded. Bitcoin-adjacent companies could include those that are involved in Bitcoin mining (a term that describes digitally creating new Bitcoin), the exchanges themselves, or even payment companies that support the buying and selling of Bitcoin.\n\nIf it\u2019s a public company, and it makes money by interacting in some way with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, buying shares is one way to add Bitcoin exposure to your portfolio. Of course, if that company isn\u2019t doing well, your investment could take a hit.\n\nIs Bitcoin volatile?\n\nWhen it comes to investing, there\u2019s a direct relationship between risk and return. High-risk investments can have high potential returns \u2014 but they can also have great potential for loss.\n\nIt\u2019s a balancing act. Having some exposure to risk can help investors grow their wealth and keep pace with inflation over the long term. At the same time, you may want more stable assets to mitigate risk. If you put all your savings into Bitcoin and it underperforms, what will that mean for your financial health?\n\nLike all cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is considered extremely volatile. It doubled its value in 2021, but then lost most of that gain in early 2022. The truth is that no investment is a sure thing. Diversifying your portfolio can protect you against market volatility.\n\nIs investing in Bitcoin right for you?\n\nBefore you put all your money into Bitcoin, take a step back and think about what you want to get out of investing. Your investment strategy will likely be determined by your age and risk tolerance. Your long-term financial goals are equally important.\n\nThere\u2019s a learning curve that comes with investing in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. And just like any other investment, returns are never guaranteed."

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin with Apple Pay? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are introducing various ways to buy Bitcoin (BTC) using the Apple Pay payment method. This comes as a good move for Bitcoin adoption since the Apple Pay digital wallet accounts for more than 507 million mobile wallet downloads and a dominating market share of 43.5% in the United States mobile payments market.\n\nThis ability to now integrate and buy Bitcoin with Apple Pay paves new crypto opportunities for iPhone users. This article explains how to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using Apple Pay.\n\nWhat is Apple Pay digital wallet?\n\nApple Pay, introduced in 2014, is a mobile payment service for web payments using iOS and is supported by Apple products. It is most commonly used as an Apple Pay application on iPhones and Apple watches. It allows users to pay for music, movies and apps with one simple touch.\n\nWith the introduction of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, offline stores are also now accepting Apple Pay leading to a surge in Apple Pay contactless payments. NFC is a proximity-based wireless connectivity technology that utilizes magnetic fields to enable communication between devices when they are brought near each other. Apple Pay is supported by thousands of apps and offline stores worldwide, allowing users to purchase numerous goods and services, as well as buy Bitcoin with their iPhone and Apple Watch using NFC.\n\nVarious ways to buy Bitcoin with Apple Pay\n\nWhile Apple does not directly have a Bitcoin or crypto integration on its devices, many popular applications and platforms facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency. Here are the various ways to buy Bitcoin using Apple Pay.\n\nBuy Bitcoin with Apple Pay through Coinbase\n\nCoinbase is a U.S.-based crypto trading and investment platform which offers a range of services and enables users to buy, sell, exchange and store cryptocurrencies. Coinbase has been expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency space through partnerships with major giants like Visa and Mastercard for offering on and off ramp crypto trading through instant purchases with credit and debit cards.\n\nTo enable a more convenient option for iOS users, Coinbase in June 2021 introduced the purchase of Bitcoin using Apple Pay linked to a debit card. However, selling crypto and cashing out options are not available with this mode yet.\n\nSteps to buy Bitcoin using Apple Pay on Coinbase\n\nLogin to the Coinbase account on the website or app using a device supporting Apple Pay. Select Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency options. Enter the amount of Bitcoin to be purchased in the \u201cBuy BTC\u201d option. Select Apple Pay from the list of available payment methods. Confirm Bitcoin purchase using Apple Pay.\n\nIt is important to note that Apple Pay will appear automatically as a payment option if a Visa or Mastercard debit card is linked to the underlying Apple Pay digital wallet. If not, ensure to do so first before following the above steps.\n\nThe limit to purchase BTC using Apple Pay on Coinbase is dependent on the sum of the debit card\u2019s transaction limit and Coinbase limits and also subject to change as per policy, geographical region and location. One can check these limits in the Coinbase app under Settings ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) can also be purchased using Apple Pay on Coinbase in a similar fashion.\n\nBuy Bitcoin with Apple Pay on Binance\n\nBinance first introduced and started providing Apple Pay integration to buy cryptocurrencies using credit and debit cards only to citizens of the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area (EEA). In December 2022, Binance announced Apple Pay (for debit cards only) to deposit USD and purchase crypto for U.S. account holders.\n\nThis opens avenues to not only purchase but also make Bitcoin and crypto investments using Apple Pay on Binance.\n\nSteps to buy Bitcoin using Apple Pay on Binance\n\nLogin to the Binance app on your iOS device. Click on \u201cWallet,\u201d select U.S. dollar and deposit USD. Click \u201cAdd Payment Method\u201d and add Apple Pay.\n\nEnter the amount of USD and tap \u201cDeposit.\u201d Add Apple Pay as the chosen payment method.\n\nProceed to purchase BTC or other cryptocurrencies with this deposit.\n\nIt is important to note that Apple Pay for the U.S. will only work for debit card integrations, while for U.K. and EEA, a credit card is an additional option. Also, there is a 3.75% fee applied to the deposit amount when using Apple Pay in the U.S. and approx 2% per transaction in the United Kingdom, subject to change as per policy. Users must ensure to check fee changes on the exchange they transact with.\n\nBuy Bitcoin using Apple Pay on BitPay\n\nBitPay is the largest Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment service provider based in Atlanta, Georgia. It allows businesses, merchants and institutions to accept cryptocurrency payments and convert them to fiat currencies. BitPay gained massive popularity as it charges merchants flat 1%transaction fees in comparison to credit cards which are known to charge higher fees ranging to 3% and sometimes more.\n\nBitPay added Apple Pay in 2021 as a payment option to allow its users to buy, exchange and shop with BTC and other cryptocurrencies using Apple Pay digital wallet. BitPay does not allow in-app crypto purchases yet, but contactless crypto purchases using NFC are possible in-store and online using Apple Pay on supported devices.\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin, BitPay also supports popular stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) and BinanceUSD (BUSD) for Apple Pay purchases. Users need to add their BitPay crypto debit card to Apple Pay and then can use Bitcoin to make purchases wherever Apple Pay is accepted globally. BitPay partnered with Simplex and Wyre to enable these Apple Pay payments.\n\nSteps to buy Bitcoin using Apple Pay on BitPay\n\nLogin to the BitPay app. Load BTC on your BitPay debit card. Add the BitPay Card to Apple Pay in the BitPay App.\n\nUse the BitPay card BTC funds to make purchases using Apple Pay.\n\nBuy Bitcoin with Apple Pay using MetaMask\n\nMetaMask, the Ethereum cryptocurrency wallet provider, also now allows users to purchase cryptocurrencies via Apple Pay. MetaMask announced its Apple Pay support in April 2022. Since this is not an integration with Apple directly, MetaMask users are redirected to Wyre, allowing them to make the payment via credit/debit card or through Apple Pay. Wyre is a cryptocurrency exchange that offers crypto to fiat via API and integrates with Apple Pay.\n\nMetaMask allows its Apple Pay users a maximum daily deposit limit of $400 into their wallet and charges a gas fee as well as its own transaction fees (0.875% of the transaction amount). Moreover, purchasing crypto through MetaMask allows users to use it across different decentralized applications (DApps) and Web3 services where MetaMask is available. However, in-store contactless purchases are still not available through this method.\n\nSteps to buy Bitcoin using Apple Pay through MetaMask\n\nLogin to your MetaMask account on browser or app. Set up Apple Pay via the app. Ensure Know Your Customer on the card connected with Apple Pay. Tap \u201cAdd Funds,\u201d click \u201cBuy BTC\u201d and input the amount. Select Apple Pay as the payment method. Authenticate and complete the transaction.\n\nWhile the above four methods are quite known, there are many other wallets, exchanges and platforms where one can avail the benefits of buying Bitcoin with Apple Pay including and not limited to Exodus, Paxful, CEX.io, Lumi Wallet, Crypto.com and more. Users must acquaint themselves with terms, conditions, fees and others before selecting their preferred method.\n\nShould you buy crypto with Apple Pay?\n\nThere is no straight answer to whether or not users should choose to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using the Apple Pay method. However, there are both benefits and drawbacks to doing so.\n\nThe positives include quick, easy and straightforward transactions. Apple Pay\u2019s contactless payment method technology makes it a preferred payment method among millennials and Gen Z users in the United States. Apple Pay statistics claim that its contactless payment method is accepted by 85% of U.S. retailers for fiat payments. This user preference is also reflected by the multitude of crypto platforms, exchanges and wallets that are bringing in contactless Apple Pay integrations.\n\nHowever, the negatives to watch for include the threat of monetary loss due to scams, hacks and malware as well as crypto volatility which may incur frequent fluctuations in prices while making purchases. Therefore, users must make informed decisions and do thorough research before using various crypto payment methods available in the market."

        "content": "Marathon Digital Holdings Announces Bitcoin Production and Mining Operation Updates for December 2022\n\n- Achieved a New Record in Quarterly BTC Production\n\n\n\n- Produced 475 BTC in December 2022, 1,562 BTC in Q4 2022, and 4,144 BTC In Fiscal Year 2022\n\n- Increased Unrestricted Cash to $103.7 Million and Unrestricted Bitcoin Holdings to 7,815 BTC as of December 31\n\n\n\nLAS VEGAS, Jan. 05, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) (\"Marathon\" or \"Company\"), a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, today published unaudited bitcoin (\u201cBTC\u201d) production and miner installation updates for December 2022.\n\nManagement Commentary\n\n\u201cIn 2022, we made significant progress in increasing our hash rate while also transitioning to more sustainable power sources,\u201d said Fred Thiel, Marathon\u2019s Chairman and CEO. \u201cDespite challenges earlier in the year, we doubled our hash rate to 7.0 exahashes per second year-over-year, with a majority of it now located at the King Mountain wind farm in West Texas. We finished the year with one of our most productive quarters to date, producing 1,562 bitcoin in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cIn December, we expanded our agreement with Applied Digital to deploy roughly 12,000 S19 XPs, which are approximately 30% more energy efficient than the prior generation of servers, at their Jamestown facility in North Dakota. This site is already constructed and operational, and our expectation is for miners to come online within the next month. In Garden City, installations of miners remain underway, as we now have roughly 2.1 exahashses installed and pending energization.\n\n\u201cWe also took proactive measures to strengthen our liquidity position and enhance the performance of our mining fleet. Given the macroeconomic uncertainty heading into 2023, we decided to fully pay down outstanding balances under our revolving credit agreement. This freed up bitcoin that was previously held as collateral, increasing our unrestricted bitcoin holdings from 4,200 BTC as of November 30 to 7,815 BTC (approximately $129.3 million) as of December 31. We finished the year with $103.7 million in cash on hand.\n\n\u201cDuring December, we tested overclocking and underclocking servers and began researching dual-phase immersion cooling systems. We also continued working with the new operator of the King Mountain site on improving operations and the curtailment strategy to optimize production. These efforts position us to develop our competitive advantages further and become a more efficient and resilient business as we continue to grow.\n\n\u201cAs we enter 2023, we remain confident in our ability to scale Marathon into one of the largest and most energy efficient Bitcoin mining operations globally. We have thousands of miners ready to be energized over the coming months, which we expect to more than triple our current production capacity to approximately 23 exahashes by mid-year.\u201d\n\nRecent Highlights\n\nProduced 475 BTC in December 2022 and 1,562 BTC in Q4 2022\n\nProduced 4,144 BTC in fiscal year 2022, a 30% increase from 3,197 BTC produced in fiscal year 2021\n\nAs of January 1, operating mining fleet consisted of approximately 69,000 active miners, capable of producing approximately 7.0 EH/s\n\n2.1 EH/s is currently pending energization after 1,000 S19 XPs were installed in December\n\nDepending on Applied Digital\u2019s energization timeline, the Company expects to have between 12.0 EH/s and 15.0 EH/s online by March 31, 2023\n\nReduced revolver borrowings from $30 million as of November 30 to $0 as of December 31, 2022\n\nUnrestricted bitcoin holdings on December 31, 2022 were approximately 7,815 BTC with a fair market value of approximately $129.3 million\n\nTotal bitcoin holdings increased to 12,232 BTC as of December 31, 2022\n\nUnrestricted cash on hand was approximately $103.7 million at December 31, 2022\n\n\n\nTechnology Update\n\nIn November, Marathon began an immersion-cooled pilot project, which involves submerging Bitcoin mining servers in a dielectric fluid to determine if the Company can improve the efficiency and/or performance of its operations. In December, Marathon\u2019s team successfully increased the hash rate of an S19 J Pro by 20% while reducing its power draw on a per terahash basis by approximately 4%. The Company also increased the hash rate of an S19 XP by 20%, marginally increasing the number of joules per terahash from 21.5 to 23.7 joules per terahash.\n\nMarathon is routinely looking for ways to stay ahead of the technology curve, and our latest exploration is into the potential benefits of dual-phase immersion. Our initial findings suggest that this technology could reduce capital expenditure on servers by approximately 10% versus traditional air-cooled setups and almost 7% compared to single-phase immersion systems. This is achieved by eliminating the need for aluminum chassis, heat synchs, and other parts, which are no longer required in dual-phase immersion cooling. In addition, energy consumption may also be reduced by approximately 7% versus single-phase immersion systems, as dual-phase immersion increases the heat density by 2.5 times, enabling more servers to be racked closely together.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen if such improvements in performance can be consistently replicated and implemented at scale, the Company is encouraged by these preliminary results and their ability to potentially increase Marathon\u2019s competitive advantages.\n\nMiner Energization and Installations Updates\n\nAccording to the latest information made publicly available, construction of facilities and installation of miners at Applied Digital\u2019s data center sites remain underway as Applied Digital awaits regulatory approval to energize its newest facilities.\n\nIn December, Marathon secured an additional 33 megawatts of hosting capacity with Applied Digital at its Jamestown, North Dakota facility. As a result of this new arrangement the Company expects to deploy approximately 12,000 S19 XPs in the coming month as this site is fully constructed and has the necessary requirements for energization.\n\nAs of December 31, Marathon\u2019s operating fleet consists of approximately 69,000 bitcoin servers, theoretically capable of producing approximately 7.0 EH/s when operating at full capacity. An additional 2.1 EH/s is currently pending energization after an additional 1,000 S19 XPs were successfully installed in Texas during the month of December.\n\nOnce all of Marathon\u2019s previously purchased miners are installed, approximately 66% of the Company\u2019s hash rate is expected to be generated by S19 XPs, which are approximately 30% more energy efficient that the prior generation of mining servers. The Company still expects to have approximately 23 EH/s of capacity installed near the middle of 2023.\n\nInvestor Notice\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and forward-looking statements described under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on March 10, 2022.

        "title": "Noise Pollution from Crypto Mining is Destroying This Town - Popular Mechanics",
        "content": "It was nearly midnight in late April when Lynell Morris\u2019s husband, Michael, returned home after a shift at work.\n\nAs he fumbled his keys, the motion-sensing light on their front doorstep flicked on. His eye caught a glint of gold: a .22 bullet on his doormat. It seemed odd as he and Lynell own a different-\u200bcaliber firearm. Nevertheless, he brought it inside and set it on their kitchen table.\n\nA few days later, he remembered to ask Lynell about it. Immediately, she yelped, \u201cPolitics!\u201d Neither Lynell nor Michael is running for office. But over the last few months, Lynell had become enmeshed in local politics after a cryptocurrency mine set up shop in their town of Murphy, North Carolina, in September 2021. \u201cMine\u201d is a misnomer, as these facilities are clusters of computing units, solving complex problems to help transact and generate virtual currency, with large\u2014and noisy\u2014fans to cool them.\n\nSitting in the foothills of the Appalachian and Blue Ridge Mountains, Murphy is a lush oasis promising an uninterrupted soundtrack of nature, and attracting those who value that quiet. Within weeks of when the mine began running, angry residents started complaining about the incessant noise on Facebook and Nextdoor. They likened this new, pervasive sound to a highway, a jet engine on the runway, or a semi idling in their driveway, and said it was disrupting their sleep and eroding their sense of peace.\n\nThe Morrises are lucky. They only hear the mine from their home when there\u2019s no other noise outside. But Lynell was frustrated by her neighbors\u2019 stories and began speaking out on their behalf at bimonthly county commissioner meetings. \u201cI take up for the underdogs,\u201d she says. Lynell has always been a leader. Before moving to Murphy three years ago with the intent to retire there, she ran a small business with her husband. And, as she puts it: \u201cI was blessed with a mouth.\u201d\n\nLynell ran her mouth on April 18, at the Cherokee County (Murphy is the county seat) board of commissioners meeting. More than six months had passed since the mine began causing a disturbance, and she was fed up with the lack of transparency from her elected officials, who had yet to act upon the concerns of their citizens. Residents have three minutes to make a statement during the public comment period at these meetings. Lynell took the podium and spoke for more than 20 minutes, pressing the commissioners on why they\u2019re backing the mine and what they\u2019re planning to do to mitigate the noise.\n\nAfter the bullet appeared on her doorstep, she wondered if she had said too much. \u201cI\u2019m a Southern girl. I don\u2019t scare easily,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a threat, nevertheless.\u201d\n\nJuan Diego Reyes Murphy resident Lynell Morris. Juan Diego Reyes The bullet found on her front step.\n\nThe Sound of Cryptocurrency\n\nFollow Highway 64\u2014or as the residents call it, the four-lane\u2014east from town for about three miles. Turn right on Harshaw Place and left on Harshaw Road at the stop sign. Drive parallel to the highway for about half a mile, and you\u2019ll see it on your left: large white boxes housing blue containers in a cornfield, partially surrounded by a gray wall. It looks out of place in western North Carolina, something so modern.\n\nAs you approach the mine, which is owned by the San Francisco-based firm PrimeBlock, you begin to hear the roar. During the day, its low-frequency hum\u2014which, directly outside, may go up to 95 decibels\u2014can make it seem like you\u2019re next to a running motorcycle. From the mine, roads weave like a spider\u2019s web. Harshaw Road continues east. Back at the stop sign, Mulkey Place goes straight. The two are bisected by Club House Road, which then turns into Poor House Mountain Trail. All the streets wind with hairpin turns up into the lush hills, splitting into side streets. Many houses off Harshaw, Mulkey, and Poor House Mountain surround what used to be the 18-hole Cherokee Hills Golf and Country Club, which closed at the end of 2016.\n\nSound travels in waves and tends to travel farthest in open landscapes. And low-frequency sounds, like the rumble from the crypto mine, travel farther than high-frequency sounds (think: a scream, or nails on a chalkboard) because the longer waves of a low-frequency noise cover more ground before losing energy. In Murphy, residents who can hear the indelible hum most prominently live near an unobstructed path from it. During winter, the noise gets worse without leaves on trees to help absorb the sound. But year-round, residents living up to a mile away from the mine can hear it.\n\nIn December, Lynell and fellow resident Cyndie Roberson started a private Facebook group for people to share their experiences and grievances. In a town of about 1,855 people, up to 800 families live within a mile of the mine.\n\nMany residents have installed apps on their phone to track the sound levels. It\u2019s so loud that Gene Johnson, whose ears were damaged during his stint in the military and who now wears hearing aids, can still hear the low rumble when the aids come out. He lives on Beaver Ridge Trail, which breaks off Harshaw immediately after you pass the mine. It\u2019s so loud that Mike and Jennifer Lugiewicz, who lived two houses down from the mine, could watch but not hear their neighbor mow their lawn. (They have since moved to be farther from the mine.) The din can hide the sound of cars, so now Shannon Coleman helps her mom, who lives a half mile past the mine on Harshaw, retrieve the mail from her box across the street on a blind turn. Her mother, who is legally blind, can\u2019t discern the sound of an oncoming car from the sound of the mine, and fears getting hit.\n\nJuan Diego Reyes Murphy resident Gene Johnson says he can still hear the mine without his hearing aids.\n\nThe noise, residents say, is especially terrible at night and early in the morning, when it wakes them up. Some say it\u2019s caused them to become depressed and anxious. They\u2019ve been showing up, as Lynell has, to county commissioners meetings bedraggled, frustrated, and angry that their elected officials have done very little to protect their health.\n\nPatricia Callahan lives in the townhouses on Club House Road. Her unit is the closest to the mine, about a quarter mile away as the crow flies.\n\nCallahan moved to Murphy three years ago, after completing a work-study program at the John Campbell Folk School, an artisan school for adults just outside Murphy, in Brasstown. Her youngest had just left for college, and Callahan was looking for a spot where she could retire. She was taken by Murphy\u2019s art scene, but more importantly, the tranquility, and decided to buy in Murphy. After her real estate agent showed her the townhouse, Callahan sat outside at its picnic table and thought, \u201cI have found my peace and quiet.\u201d\n\nThose qualities were crucial for Callahan. A car accident 15 years ago left her with a brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. \u201cI arranged my life to keep my stress low,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole body will go into a hypervigilant fight-or-flight mode when I\u2019m around too much noise.\u201d\n\nWhen the mine came online last fall, Calla han\u2019s way of life was upended. She used to open the windows at night to cool her bedroom (she prefers not to use air conditioning because she lives on a strict budget), but she must close her windows now to lower the noise. Even that, along with wearing noise-canceling headphones, is not enough. The only time she\u2019s been able to get a good night\u2019s sleep is when she\u2019s in a hotel or camping.\n\nThe noise is a constant, Callahan says. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just my hearing. It affects my whole body, triggering PTSD symptoms,\u201d she says. Many older residents with underlying health issues who have retired in Murphy express a similar sentiment: The noise and sleep interruptions caused by the mine are making their conditions worse.\n\nCallahan says she can\u2019t sell her house to move somewhere quieter. \u201cNothing is within my budget,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trapped here.\u201d\n\nMining New Money\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital form of currency that can be used like cash or a credit card. Unlike the U.S. dollar, there is no central authority that prints more coins, or maintains the value of a cryptocurrency. This lack of oversight and regulation is appealing to many who wish to grow their wealth without traditional banking institutions.\n\nBitcoin became the first viable cryptocurrency in 2009, and over the last 13 years, demand for cryptocurrencies has only skyrocketed. Now, there are more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies valued around $1 trillion in total, and a 2021 Pew Research study found that one in six Americans use them. \u201cThere is a general movement of making finance more for the people,\u201d Matteo Benetton, PhD, an assistant professor of finance at University of California, Berkeley, says of cryptocurrency\u2019s appeal. Cryptocurrency mining is computers solving complex algorithms to record crypto transactions that prevent people from spending their currency more than once. After a certain amount of work, a mine is paid in newly created cryptocurrency. This computing relies on an astronomical amount of power. The Murphy mine, according to Scott Wade, the head of operations at Exponential Digital, the company that operates the mine and was acquired by PrimeBlock last January, uses anywhere from 5 to 15 megawatts annually, enough to power up to 13,500 homes. (A gaming laptop, by comparison, would use 0.02 megawatts running year-round.)\n\nJuan Diego Reyes The PrimeBlock crypto currency mine on October 14, 2022. A section of the partial enclosure can be seen in the background.\n\nUp until 2021, most of the world\u2019s crypto mines were housed in China. But when the country banned the use and mining of cryptocurrency that fall\u2014largely because of the Chinese government\u2019s fear that cryptocurrencies are a gateway to financial crime and have a negative impact on the environment\u2014miners flocked to the U.S. According to the Bitcoin Mining Map developed by the University of Cambridge in the U.K., the U.S. now makes up the majority of the total global hashrate, or the computational power processing cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nIn the U.S., crypto companies generally set up shop in places like the Finger Lakes region in upstate New York, eastern Washington, South Dakota, and towns like Murphy along the Tennessee Valley. They all offer cheap electricity, and often, mines can be built in repurposed factories.\n\nNot only is noise pollution an issue, but the annual electricity use worldwide from exclusively mining Bitcoin\u2014just one type of crypto currency\u2014is extensive. Some studies estimate it can even exceed that of entire countries. This overall higher community electricity use raises the cost for residents.\n\nThe Pain of Noise Pollution\n\nBecause cryptocurrency is relatively new, there are few peer-reviewed studies that specifically link it to how its mines affect human health and the environment. Twenty-\u200btwo state legislators have written to the EPA to monitor the environmental impact of mining cryptocurrency. But noise is the primary complaint in Murphy, and plenty is known about how loud, persistent, low-frequency sounds can lead to a host of problems.\n\nIn the 1970s, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Office of Noise Abatement and Control recognized noise as a pollutant and began taking steps to limit community exposure. Through the now-defunct office, researchers determined that, to ensure their health and welfare, residents shouldn\u2019t be exposed to more than an average of 55 decibels over the course of a day. Anything higher, in terms of sound level or length of exposure, could increase an individual\u2019s chances of hearing loss. Even though the world around us has gotten noisier since then\u2014particularly in cities and largely due to industrial noise\u2014our ears can\u2019t adapt accordingly, says Deanna Meinke, PhD, an audiologist who studies dangerous decibels at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley.\n\nOver the last few decades, researchers have seen that prolonged exposure to noise can lead to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues, and even exacerbate mental health disorders. What\u2019s more, noise pollution can be more detrimental at night, when our bodies are much more vulnerable to sounds during sleep.\n\nAnd sound-level guidelines for health impacts beyond hearing loss don\u2019t yet exist. \u201cWe don\u2019t have limits for a noise level that would prevent heart attacks, or prevent high blood pressure, or prevent depression,\u201d says Rick Neitzel, PhD, a noise pollution expert at the University of Michigan.\n\nIn 2020, an international team of researchers published a study in European Heart Journal where they followed about 500 healthy adults for five years. They found that every five-decibel increase over a baseline 45 decibels for a 24-hour span was associated with a 34 percent jump in heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular issues.\n\nAnd in the early 1990s, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sponsored several studies to determine how loud an airport could be without making residents seriously annoyed. They found that about half of the residents reached that threshold of annoyance when exposed to an average of 75 decibels over a 24-hour period, although they didn\u2019t characterize how that manifested in health impacts. But about 20 years later, a group of German researchers tracked over 2,300 residents who lived in the flight path of Frankfurt Airport, and found that the individuals who reported to be \u201cstrongly annoyed\u201d by the noise were twice as likely as others to feel depressed or anxious.\n\nResearchers have seen that prolonged exposure to noise can lead to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues, and exacerbate mental health disorders.\n\nJuan Diego Reyes Downtown Murphy, North Carolina.\n\nThe annoyance and resulting stress that Callahan and her neighbors face shouldn\u2019t be discounted, says Neitzel. \u201cAnnoyance is a huge byproduct of noise exposure, and we don\u2019t really understand how important that is in terms of putting someone at risk.\u201d\n\nWhen noise becomes a stressor\u2014as it has been in Murphy\u2014it activates the adrenal system, which not only responds to stress but also regulates an individual\u2019s immune and cardiovascular system. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to spend 8, 10, or 12 hours a day in that condition,\u201d Neitzel says. It can drive up heart rate and blood pressure, and cause problems down the line.\n\nEnvironmental Exodus\n\nAs soon as the mine came online, residents in the surrounding neighborhood began noticing changes in animal behavior. Ronny and Kathy Williams, who live atop Poor House Mountain Trail, lament the decline of birds in their backyard, where they keep multiple feeders. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen very few goldfinches this year. The house finches came and went. And I\u2019ve only seen one Carolina wren this year,\u201d Ronny says.\n\nMeanwhile, Phyllis Cantrell, who lives about as far from the mine as the Williamses, has noted that hawks and eagles no longer nest nearby. The hummingbird feeders on her deck she used to refill four times a day are now going three days before she replenishes them. The area near the mine used to be prime habitat for wild turkey and deer. Now, they\u2019re moving farther up the mountains. Morris, for instance, has recently found deer in her backyard for the first time.\n\nA herd of horses that live on a patch of land across from the mine on Harshaw have been trying to flee more frequently, too, according to the Lugiewiczes, who live across from where they\u2019re kept. On a warm weekend last December, on a day when the fans from the mine were especially loud, Jennifer and Shannon Coleman spent an hour trying to wrangle the horses\u2014who seemed spooked by the noise\u2014all the while shouting over the din, standing just five feet away from each other. And dogs begin howling, says Cantrell, when the mine is especially loud at night.\n\nResearch shows that hundreds of animal species are affected by noise, says Clinton D. Francis, PhD, an evolutionary ecologist who studies noise pollution at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.\n\nThe ability to perceive sounds and respond is a part of a \u201cuniversal threat detection system\u201d across vertebrates, he says. \u201cHearing is used to passively listen for threats while we\u2019re doing other things.\u201d\n\nThe impact of noise pollution is perhaps best characterized for birds. They may modify their songs to be at a higher pitch or sing more frequently to stand out amid the noise. Some field research shows that about a third of birds may completely leave an area because of noise pollution, with major ecological consequences. In 2012, Francis and his colleagues published a study that showed low-frequency industrial noise from gas wells and compressors (clocking in at around 95 decibels) reshaped areas of the Rattlesnake Canyon Habitat Management Area in northwestern New Mexico. Birds there are critical in dispersing seeds of the Colorado pinyon pine. And now, some preliminary research from Francis\u2019s group suggests that noise pollution may lead to inheritable changes in specific species and populations. In other words: Noisy enterprises like crypto mines can alter the wildlife near it for generations to come.\n\nBut Francis is heartened by the fact that when the source of noise is removed, animals reclaim where they once lived. Think back to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, when the songs of the white-crowned sparrows in San Francisco grew more frequent when the din of the city subsided, or lions napped along traffic-free roads in South Africa.\n\nJuan Diego Reyes Beaver Ridge Trail loops around the neighborhood next to the mine.\n\nLax Zoning Laws and Few Answers\n\nDespite the annoyance, the deleterious health effects, and the damage to the ecosystem, there\u2019s no legal protection for the residents of Murphy due to scant zoning laws in Cherokee County, which would otherwise protect residential areas from industrial development. Already, there are three mines in the county, and citizens fear more may be coming.\n\nSome Murphy residents have left because of the noise from the mine. Others who have put their life savings into their idyllic mountain home have no choice but to fight for change and show up to the commissioners meetings in droves. So far, the residents\u2019 concerns about noise mostly have fallen on deaf ears. They\u2019re also frustrated by the lack of answers from their five commissioners as to how the mine ended up there in the first place. They\u2019re trying to get their elected officials to enforce a 1999 county ordinance under which perpetrators are fined $50 a day for sustained noise above 50 decibels. But the commissioners say that the ordinance is unenforceable without the zoning laws that Cherokee County lacks.\n\nAnd without zoning laws, it\u2019s impossible for anyone to find a legal standing to hold anyone accountable. In Limestone, Tennessee, where the cryptocurrency company Red Dog set up shop, residents had recourse because Red Dog violated an existing zoning ordinance. That county sued and won. The mine is set to shut down by the end of 2024, pay associated penalties, and relocate away from a residential area.\n\nThe Cherokee County board of commissioners\u2014particularly Dan Eichenbaum, Gary Westmoreland, and Randy Phillips, who locals refer to as \u201cthe triad\u201d for their similar voting patterns on controversial issues\u2014are not keen on changing the status quo. None responded to comment on this story. And amid the calls for zoning reform, a quieter contingent of Murphy residents don\u2019t want any government interference in land use or rights.\n\nSince the Murphy mine was set up last fall, it was partially enclosed by wall sections in February, but locals say that only made the sound worse, as the openings between the walls funnel sound in very specific directions. Wade, of Exponential Digital, said that this partial enclosure helps them \u201cmaintain and preserve natural cooling and airflow, resulting in a more energy- efficient operation while further mitigating sound.\u201d Moving forward, Wade says, the company will work closely with the commissioners to ensure the facility doesn\u2019t generate more noise.\n\nFor now, Morris hopes that this year\u2019s election will help, as the residents can vote for someone who will make decisions in their interests. \u201cUntil you get the commissioners behind this and really start pushing for it, change isn\u2019t going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt starts with them.\u201d\n\nSince the bullet on her doorstep, Morris has taken a backseat at the meetings, but she\u2019s still attending and staying engaged. Already, not even a year out, she\u2019s tired, and looking forward to what\u2014eventually\u2014could come after the mine. For her, it means peace and quiet, and the paradise that Murphy promised."
