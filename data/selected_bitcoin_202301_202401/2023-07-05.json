        "content": "Investors who want to bet on Bitcoin may soon have more options to choose from if US regulators soften their opposition to exchange-traded funds tied directly to Bitcoin holdings. Major financial firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco have submitted applications to sell US \u201cspot\u201d Bitcoin ETFs that would be physically backed by actual Bitcoin. In the past, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has routinely rejected these products, citing wariness over volatility and potential manipulation. Investors took the BlackRock filing, in particular, as a sign that the SEC was close to dropping its longtime opposition to such financial projects. Bitcoin prices hit a one-year high in the days after BlackRock\u2019s application.\n\nETFs, a $7 trillion industry , are part of a broader family of products known as exchange-traded products, though people frequently use \u201cETFs\u201d to refer to all of them since they are by far the largest and most popular category. Crypto-native firms and major Wall Street financial institutions alike are trying to launch a kind of ETF that actually holds Bitcoin, as opposed to the products that invest in Bitcoin futures. The SEC hasn\u2019t approved any applications for these so-called spot Bitcoin ETFs, whereas multiple futures-backed crypto funds already exist in the market. Futures-backed Bitcoin ETFs have been available to US customers since 2021. Issuers and investors are advocating for spot Bitcoin ETFs to be similarly accessible to retail and institutional investors in the US, a development that\u2019s perceived as having the potential to greatly broaden participation in the cryptocurrency industry."

        "content": "BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who once called Bitcoin an \u201cindex of money laundering,\u201d today said the oldest and biggest cryptocurrency was \u201cdigitalizing gold.\u201d\n\nThe billionaire\u2019s comments in a Fox Business interview Wednesday came weeks after the world\u2019s largest asset manager applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock\u2014which manages $9.5 trillion in assets\u2014helped spur a Bitcoin run with its application, leading institutional investors to pour money into the space and causing the asset to jump to a 12-month high.\n\n\u201cI do believe the role of crypto is digitalizing gold, in many ways,\u201d said Fink. \u201cInstead of investing in gold as a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear\u2014Bitcoin is an international asset,\u201d he added.\n\nFink has come a long way since 2017 when he said, \u201cBitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.\u201d Rude? Maybe.\n\nYears later, though, he admitted that Bitcoin was a \u201cgreat asset\u201d and that BlackRock had, in fact, made money from investing in the digital currency. He has continued to say that the asset would grow.\n\nHi you. Yes, you. Want to win some Ordinals? We've collected some pretty pieces (we don't want to give away TOO much but we guarantee you will not be disappointed) from @Bitcoin_Whales_, @SkullxNFT, @btcordinal, and @OrdinalDiamonds into a wallet. pic.twitter.com/Qy3sBfGN8K \u2014 Decrypt (@decryptmedia) July 5, 2023\n\nBlackRock Bitcoin ETF Is the \u2018Real Deal\u2019\u2014Is This Finally the One?\n\nNow, BlackRock is hoping to get approval from Wall Street\u2019s biggest regulator. A spot Bitcoin ETF does not yet exist in the U.S., and the SEC has launched a tough crackdown on the digital asset industry. But experts think BlackRock has a chance: the asset manager has had nearly every single one of its ETF applications approved by the regulator.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading for $30,446 per coin, according to CoinGecko data. At the start of the year, it was priced at less than $17,000."

        "content": "BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with nearly $9 trillion in assets under management, has made significant strides toward embracing bitcoin, as indicated by its recent filing for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The company\u2019s decision to take steps to offer its clients exposure to the digital asset are likely to bring a surge of institutional adoption to the space.\n\nThe company also recently resubmitted their filing after the SEC responded that the initial filings required more information in regards to the exchange\u2019s involved, subsequently adding Coinbase to the filing, as other firms refiling did.\n\nAnd now, BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, has made an appearance on Fox Business where he stated that the role of bitcoin and crypto is \u201cdigitizing gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation \u2026 or the devaluation of your currency \u2026 [bitcoin] can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,\u201d Fink stated. The description reinforces the perception of bitcoin as a store of value, akin to the role gold has traditionally played in investment portfolios. By likening bitcoin to gold, Fink acknowledges the international nature of the digital asset, highlighting its potential as a global store of wealth \u2014 and indeed, during his news appearance, Fink further emphasized that, \"Bitcoin is an international asset.\"\n\nThe televised statement underscores the conviction Fink, and likely BlackRock, have in bitcoin and its potential role in the future. Fink's recognition of bitcoin's international appeal further bolsters the case for increased institutional interest and investment.\n\nBlackRock's pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF and Fink's endorsement of bitcoin as digitized gold reflect a notable shift in the attitude of major financial institutions toward bitcoin. These developments suggest that BlackRock, along with other industry giants, recognizes the potential of bitcoin to reshape the financial landscape.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
