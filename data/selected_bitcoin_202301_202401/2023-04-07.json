        "content": "Russia has become the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency mining country this year, the Kommersant business daily reported Friday, citing Bitriver, Russia\u2019s largest bitcoin mining provider.\n\nWhile the United States remains by far the world's largest crypto miner, boasting 3-4 gigawatts of mining capacity, Russia\u2019s generating capacity reached 1 gigawatt in January-March 2023.\n\nIn taking second place for the first time, Russia took a spot previously occupied by Kazakhstan, which introduced restrictions on crypto mining activities in 2022 and now ranks ninth, Kommersant cited Bitriver as saying.\n\nChina, which banned crypto mining in 2021, did not make Bitriver\u2019s top 10 at all.\n\nBitcoin use is limited in Russia due to restrictive laws on cryptocurrencies including President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2020 law on digital financial assets, which legalized cryptocurrencies but banned using them to pay for goods and services.\n\nStill, cryptocurrencies have been linked to Russia\u2019s sanctions evasion strategies, with the United States blacklisting a bitcoin and an ether address in February that it said may have been involved in Russian defense equipment sales abroad.\n\nThe European Union imposed a total ban on carrying out cryptocurrency transactions with Russian citizens and anyone resident in the country as part of its eighth round of sanctions introduced last year."

        "title": "The Bitcoin white paper has been hidden on Macs since 2018. Here\u2019s how to find it - Fortune",
        "content": "On every Mac operating system post 2018, a nine-page PDF is hidden inside a nest of folders. That PDF is none other than the Bitcoin white paper, the famed theoretical outline of the cryptocurrency authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous inventor.\n\nOn Wednesday, Andy Baio, former CTO of Kickstarter, was the first to publicly announce that he had found the squirreled-away PDF after he tried to connect a combination printer-scanner to his MacBook.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked over a dozen Mac-using friends to confirm, and it was there for every one of them,\u201d he wrote on his more than two decades old blog. He thinks the white paper\u2019s inclusion was the work of a single engineer, rather than an Easter egg ordained from on high.\n\nWhile Baio has been a techie for decades, it\u2019s relatively simple to find the same document on your very own Mac. Here\u2019s how:\n\nUsing Terminal\n\nEvery iteration of the Mac operating system has what\u2019s called Terminal, or a way to explore a computer\u2019s file system through text commands. To access Terminal on your Mac, simply go to the Applications folder, then open the Utilities folder, and click on it.\n\nBaio wrote a simple command for Mac users to reveal the hidden Bitcoin white paper. Copy and paste the following code into Terminal once it\u2019s open:\n\nopen /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdf\n\nUsing Finder\n\nThe more time-intensive approach\u2014but one with a technologically lower bar\u2014is to navigate through Finder, a Mac\u2019s file management system.\n\nOpen a Finder window, navigate to the System folder, and prepare yourself for a deluge of clicks.\n\nFrom Systems, go to Library, Image Capture, and then Devices. Once in Devices, right click on VirtualScanner and choose Show Package Contents. That should open up another folder titled Contents, through which you should navigate to Resources, which will reveal a number of files.\n\nClick on simpledoc.pdf, and voil\u00e0! You should finally have arrived at your destination: the nine-page outline that detailed the theoretical specifications of Bitcoin, a piece of digital dust that, in aggregate, is worth well over $500 billion as of Friday afternoon."

        "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto is said to be the inventor of bitcoin and wrote the token's original white paper in 2008.\n\nCrypto fans this week celebrated Nakamoto's 48th birthday amid new theories as to their true identity.\n\nHere's what to know about the mysterious icon behind the world's largest cryptocurrency.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the name of the individual or group credited with inventing bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency. Their legend is shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe inventor's identity has never been confirmed, though April 5 marked their 48th birthday, according to information on a profile with The P2P Foundation.\n\nThis week, conspiracy theories connected the figure to the late Steve Jobs, the visionary Apple cofounder, following the revelation that Apple has shipped out Mac computers since 2018 with a copy of the original bitcoin white paper.\n\n\"While trying to fix my printer today, I discovered that a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper apparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018,\" technologist Andy Baio wrote in an April 5 blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNakamoto's paper, \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" was published in October 2008. The abstract reads:\n\n\"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\"\n\nSince then, bitcoin has become the largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of about $540 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data on Friday.\n\nWhat we know about Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nSomeone is behind the name, given that they invented bitcoin's complex source code, authored a white paper, and interacted with users on web forums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNakamoto's profile on The P2P Foundation lists their location as Japan. In their posts, however, Nakamoto has used British English spellings and expressions, leading some to assume they are in fact not Japanese, as the inventor claimed. Additionally, some have pointed to the time stamps on Nakamoto's comments as reason to believe they were not located in Japan.\n\nIn 2011, a comment from that account stated that they had \"moved onto other things.\"\n\nThe name is also associated with a number of crypto wallets, presumably owned by Nakamoto. Some estimate that those wallets hold more than 1.1 million bitcoin tokens. When bitcoin peaked in November 2021 at $68,000, those holdings would have been worth about $73 billion, placing Nakamoto among the 15 riches people in the world at the time.\n\nSome have speculated that the chances Nakamoto is one person are low, given the complexity of bitcoin's source code.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Either there's a team of people who worked on this or this guy is a genius,\" Dan Kaminsky, a leading internet-security researcher, told The New Yorker in 2011.\n\nIn his white paper, Nakamoto cited the work of Stuart Haber, a computer scientist credited with helping invent blockchain technology. Haber has echoed Kaminsky's sentiment that the programmer behind bitcoin would have had a \"keen intelligence.\"\n\nOther names that have been connected to Nakamoto\n\nIn 2013, Nick Szabo, a computer scientist who published research in 1998 on \"bit gold,\" a precursor to bitcoin, drew attention for potentially being Nakamoto. He has denied it, and financial writer Dominic Frisby has said no proof exists connecting the two figures.\n\n\"The most convincing evidence pointed to a reclusive American man of Hungarian descent named Nick Szabo,\" journalist Nathaniel Popper wrote in The New York Times in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Newsweek article in 2014 said that Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in California, was the elusive inventor of bitcoin. According to the article, he was trained as a physicist and worked on classified defense projects, but he, too, denied the claims.\n\nAfter the article published, Nakamoto's online account revived itself after a five-year hiatus, stating: \"I am not Dorian Nakamoto.\"\n\nThen, in December 2015, Wired posited that Australian researcher Craig Steven Wright \"either invented bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did.\"\n\nThe same day, Gizmodo published a story that said Wright, as well as computer scientist Dave Kleiman, together were involved in the invention of bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in May 2016, Wright announced in a blog post that he did create bitcoin, though he was met with prominent crypto figures who said it was false.\n\nThe list of other potential candidates, apart from Apple's Jobs, includes the government, various other computer scientists, and even Elon Musk, who denied he was Nakamoto in a 2017 tweet.\n\nOn Friday, bitcoin hovered around $27,937. It has surged 68% in 2023."
