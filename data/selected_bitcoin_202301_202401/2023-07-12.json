        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nEurope\u2019s first bitcoin exchange traded fund is expected to be publicly listed this month, 12 months after its planned launch.\n\nJacobi Asset Management originally announced that its bitcoin ETF was to list on Euronext Amsterdam in July 2022. However, it now says the fund is \u201con track\u201d to launch this month, having decided that last year \u201cthe time wasn\u2019t right\u201d following the Terra Luna cryptocurrency crash in May 2022 and crypto exchange FTX\u2019s collapse in November.\n\nThe asset manager says \u201cdemand has shifted since last summer\u201d.\n\nIn Europe all digital assets exchange traded products so far have been structured as exchange traded notes, rather than funds.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites Europe, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nEach ETF shareholder owns a portion of a fund\u2019s underlying shares, while investors in ETNs own a debt security, not the underlying assets.\n\nJacobi has made much of the fact that it is launching an ETF rather than an exchange traded note.\n\nPeter Lane, co-founder and chief operating officer of Jacobi, told Ignites Europe last year that structured note issuers were guilty of \u201cmisuse\u201d of the ETF term.\n\n\u201cThere has been so much misinformation and misuse of the term ETF by [ETN] issuers, presumably to obfuscate the risks that are inherent in acquiring and investing in ETNs,\u201d he said.\n\nJacobi said its ETF, unlike ETNs, cannot be leveraged or use derivatives, which could otherwise lead to \u201csignificant counterparty risk\u201d.\n\nThe fund has been authorised in Guernsey, a jurisdiction that offers \u201ca number of advantages\u201d to help the launch of a bitcoin fund, said David Crosland, a partner in offshore law firm Carey Olsen.\n\n\u201cAs a specialist fund servicing jurisdiction that is not subject to the inherent inflexibilities of being an EU member, Guernsey was able to move quickly to adapt to support this launch,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c[Guernsey\u2019s] flexibility and willingness to understand the complex detail has allowed the promoter to launch a fund vehicle that benefits from regulated fund status when other European jurisdictions are unable to do so,\u201d Crosland added.\n\nMichael O\u2019Riordan, founding partner of ETF and digital assets consultancy Blackwater Search and Advisory, said the regulatory challenges of launching a bitcoin ETF in Europe were \u201cvery large\u201d as bitcoin was not considered an eligible asset under Ucits rules.\n\n\u201cHowever, in practice, apart from some structural differences, the ETF and the ETP are quite similar,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs an industry, we have not done a good job at distinguishing each and as a result there is a lot of confusion in the market as to which is which,\u201d O\u2019Riordan added.\n\nNet flows into European digital assets ETPs over the past 18 months amounted to $483mn, including inflows of $398mn in the third quarter of 2022 alone, according to data from Coinbase and Bloomberg.\n\nAssets in European digital assets ETPs stand at \u20ac4.3bn, having peaked at \u20ac10.5bn at the end of 2021, according to Ignites Europe analysis of Morningstar data.\n\n*Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "title": "Will the Rally in Bitcoin Mining ETFs Last in 2H23? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The year 2023 has so far seen Bitcoin mining companies exceed the performance of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC). The cryptocurrency is up about 84% so far this year (as of Jul 10, 2023).\n\nMeanwhile, Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF WGMI, Crypto Industry Innovators ETF BITQ, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF SATO and Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITS added about 244.8%, 172.2%, 161.4% and 124.8%, respectively, so far this year (as of Jul 10, 2023).\n\nThis divergence in price performance is primarily attributed to a less-hawkish Fed which helped growth stocks like bitcoin miners. Increased transaction fees, prominent issuers\u2019 interest in launching a bitcoin ETF also acted as drivers in boosting those stocks. If these were not enough, the leveraged beta effect, which tends to boost mining stocks more than the underlying asset, played a key role.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of interest rate hikes left investors wondering if mining stocks can maintain their upward trajectory in the second half of the year. Let\u2019s delve a little deeper.\n\nFears of Higher Rates Weigh on Crypto Stocks\n\nThe Fed's efforts to curb inflation through interest rate hikes have caused uncertainties for high-risk assets like digital currencies. In past one week, bitcoin remained almost flat. While this decline may be a short-term correction, a resilient U.S. labor market strengthens rate hike expectations, alarming Bitcoin's future.\n\nWhat Are Silver Linings?\n\nBlackrock, WisdomTree and Invesco Plan to Launch Bitcoin ETFs: The filing of spot ETF applications by renowned asset managers fueled a growing interest in cryptocurrencies from institutional and corporate clients. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been in denial for a Bitcoin ETF for long, the filings represent a significant step towards widespread adoption. The world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock\u2019s plans to launch a bitcoin ETF in June influenced the entire space. Two other large investment firms now joined the queue, WisdomTree and Invesco.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraditional Finance Giants Explore Crypto Space: Renowned financial institutions, including Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel Securities, have partnered to launch EDX Markets, a crypto exchange platform. EDX Markets, which had faced delays due to regulatory uncertainty, has finally listed major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: Institutions such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which were against virtual currencies before, have started implementing them into their systems. This is a sign of growing acceptance among institutional investors.\n\nFavorable Regulations in the Cards?Though the SEC\u2019s stance toward cryptocurrency has been adverse so far, back-to-back efforts in launching an ETF from reported issuers stirred speculation that such intuitional initiatives might compel legislative institutions to figure out how to classify and regulate them.\n\nPositive Outlook for Bitcoin Mining Companies: Bitcoin mining stocks are well-positioned for growth. Mining companies have been making expansion moves, increasing their hash rates, and planning to acquire more mining machines. Such companies include Hut 8 Mining, Riot Platforms and Cleanspark. In fact, bitcoin hash rate hit a new all-time high amid weakening prices.\n\nBitcoin Having Expected in 2024: Halving events, which occur about every four years, lower the mining rewards by half. The resulting shortage of newly mined BTC has historically played a crucial role in driving price rallies. As the having event looms in 2024, traders are tightening their belts for a new cycle. So, there is high chance of an upward momentum for Bitcoin.\n\nCheaper Valuation: Last year, bitcoin was thrashed as rising rates weighed on speculative and growth investments. This has helped the crypto block to bounce back with all force.\n\nSustainability Parameter: Cryptocurrencies are being promoted as an eco-friendlier investment. Sustainability concerns are in vogue lately as the global investing world is concerned about climate change.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Grayscale calls out SEC over spot bitcoin ETF denials - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Several large investment managers have recently submitted applications to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale Investments has been trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF since 2016 and has yet to get approval. Now, its calling out the Securities and Exchange Commission over its approval of a leveraged bitcoin futures ETF. Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein joints Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his company's efforts to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right, Bitcoin has soared over the last month on hopes that regulators are going to finally approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. We're looking at gains of just about almost 17% in the price of Bitcoin getting a boost after BlackRock filed paperwork with the SEC last month sparking a new wave of optimism and several institutions followed.\n\nWhile Grayscale has been trying to get approval for a spot market ETF since 2016, its last request was denied. Now the company is calling out the SEC. For more on this, we want to bring in Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale Investments CEO.\n\nMichael, it's great to see you. And I want to bring up the letter that you recently sent. And we have a full screen here to show exactly what you are laying out. You sent a letter to the DC Court of Appeals questioning the SEC's decision to approve a leveraged Bitcoin future ETF after previously denying a spot Bitcoin ETF. So lay out your case here and why these two decisions don't add up.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Absolutely. Well, it's great to be back on the show. I would say that this really comes down to the core argument. When the SEC denied our application to convert GBTC into an ETF, we immediately filed a lawsuit challenging that decision.\n\nAnd the argument that really underpins that is that the SEC has approved, not one, but several Bitcoin futures-based ETFs-- futures are a derivative of that underlying spot market-- but continued to deny, including GBTC, spot Bitcoin applications from coming to market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd those arguments were presented to the court. We believe that they're common sense and compelling arguments. But the SEC now has gone on and continued to even go further into this arbitrary behavior by now approving a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF which, in the actual prospectus itself, outlines that that's an even riskier product, right?\n\nAnd so we do feel here that investors should have choice, right? They should be able to use Bitcoin futures ETFs. They should be able to use spot Bitcoin ETFs, really whatever's going to fit their mandate as an investor.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Michael, why do you think the SEC has been so reluctant. I mean, what's your read on what is driving or what's motivating the SEC to put the brake?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, I can really only point to what they've said in their denials, right? The SEC has been looking for a market that is surveyable, a market that maybe has the qualities and characteristics of other markets that they're used to seeing.\n\nThat being said, there are new conversations being had around surveillance-sharing agreements and other types of constructs that maybe the SEC will be persuaded by, but time, I think, will tell.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Michael, many though are looking at the approval of the leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF as a positive step forward given the fact that then maybe this makes it a little bit more likely that the SEC is going to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, do you share in that view?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, I think there's been a recent wave of ETF applications that have come in and part of that optimism really does revolve around the GBTC lawsuit. We've been transparent with the market that we expect a decision from the court sometime. It could be as soon as over the next few weeks, but probably by the fall the latest.\n\nAnd so there's a lot of issuers that have been looking at-- Not only has GBTC kind of laid the groundwork and become a place where many investors have gotten their Bitcoin exposure, but it's now the framework upon which they're basing their operations, their disclosure, et cetera. So they believe that that, in fact, could be a catalyst if a favorable outcome is reached, there.\n\nAnd it continues to show that investor interest and appetite for this asset class isn't going away and the continuation of Bitcoin futures, Bitcoin-leveraged futures ETFs, these are all additional access points that investors now have.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Michael, it's been what? More than eight months now since we saw really just the collapse of FTX. And there were a lot of concerns, conversations around that time about what the future of crypto will look like.\n\nI mean, you've got institutional names now trying to get in with the spot Bitcoin ETF and really the opportunity is there as well. But what do you think has evolved in the thinking within the crypto space and does that ultimately strengthen the case for investment into something like Bitcoin?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: You know, it's great to think about that timeline in perspective, because you're right. It was only six, eight months ago that the narrative around crypto was that it was being left for dead or it was a passing fad or investors were fleeing it. And what we've said is it's actually quite the opposite.\n\nYou know, this is my and Grayscale's third crypto winter. And we've continued to reiterate. It's a great time to build. And it's a time when crypto gets challenged and really demonstrates its resiliency. And so you've seen continued optimism, additional institutional investors coming to the space.\n\nAnd assets like Bitcoin are some of the highest returning assets of the year. And so it really does show the staying power of the asset class and that additional narrative from some of these incumbent legacy financial institutions is a really important construct for investors to keep in mind as well.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Michael, we do see the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF. How much of-- is that a game changer here for the industry just in terms of wider adoption and given the fact that many investors, you would think, want maybe some exposure to crypto, but they're more comfortable going that ETF route?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Exactly. I think the ETF wrapper is a tried-and-true product model that investors are used to for commodities, segments of the market, et cetera. And I think all of the issuers filing know there's a lot of pent-up demand.\n\nAnd so whether you're looking at GBTC or any of the other products looking to come to market, there are trillions of dollars on the sideline-- even just in the financial advisor market-- that are looking for a convenient solution to give their clients exposure to Bitcoin, so we do think it could be a material moment for Bitcoin to say the least.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: OK. To be continued there. Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein, good to have you on today.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Thank you."
