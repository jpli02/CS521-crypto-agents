        "content": "Cryptocurrency platforms are bringing in Bitcoin Pizza Day by distributing free pizzas, gift vouchers, and other goodies. Indian players Coinswitch, Mudrex, and Zebpay are running campaigns to promote and celebrate the day when Bitcoin was used for the first time to buy a real-world commodity.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is celebrated widely by the crypto community worldwide on May 22 every year. The symbolism of the event is to mark how open-source internet money, which wasn\u2019t of significant worth then, went on to be the highest-valued crypto token in the world and saw wide adoption.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch is giving away pizzas to crypto users who share their experiences of entering the world of cryptocurrencies. CEO Ashish Singhal wrote in a tweet, \u201cShare your first experience of investing in crypto, and I\u2019ll gift a pizza for the most unique story. Let\u2019s celebrate together with pizza.\u201d He also noted that his introduction to crypto was in 2014, when he started dabbling with Bitcoin nodes and codes.\n\nAlso read Bitcoin on course for longest streak of monthly gains since 2021\n\nSimilarly, exchange Zebpay has a Bitcoin Pizza Day offer on the platform. Crypto users who trade on the platform today can win gift vouchers worth \u20b91,000. \u201cTrade from \u20b91,000 to \u20b91 lakh or more and stand a chance to win prizes including cash vouchers, air tickets, and much more,\u201d the platform said on Twitter.\n\nMudrex, a crypto investing platform, is also running a Bitcoin Pizza Day campaign and has distributed pizzas to approximately 300 start-ups and companies in and around Bengaluru. It has also partnered with Via Milano in Bangalore, granting new signees the opportunity to indulge in complimentary pizzas provided by Via Milano.\n\nIts CEO and co-founder, Edul Patel, said, \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day symbolizes the incredible journey of cryptocurrencies, from a humble transaction to a global phenomenon. It reminds us of the immense growth potential and transformative power of digital assets in shaping the future of finance.\u201d\n\nGlobal crypto player Binance is tying up with members of the community to make their own pizza, complete with their own \u2018BTC\u2019 toppings logo. Participants would be winning the crypto equivalent of a year\u2019s supply of pizza.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nThe day is celebrated to mark the first time Bitcoin was used for a real-life transaction. On May 22, 2010, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 bitcoins, at a time when Bitcoin was known and understood by very few people.\n\nLaszlo Hanyecz, a programmer in Florida who was a part of the initial phases of Bitcoin, decided he had to put his mined tokens to use. He then put out a message on the Bitcoin Talk Forum saying, \u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas, like maybe two large ones, so I have some leftover for the next day.\u201d\n\nA few days later, on May 22, a man on the forum named Jeremy Sturdivant took up the offer and got Hanyecz and two pizzas delivered from Papa John\u2019s. A single Bitcoin today is worth $26,830.5 and was even worth $69,044 at its all-time high in 2021.\n\nAlso read: WazirX partners with Taxnodes to simplify tax computation for VDAs"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been the subject of intense speculation and volatility in recent times. In the midst of these dynamics, bullish Bitcoin price predictions prevail. In fact, some of them reach the $1 million mark. One of the reasons for that is the much-anticipated halving event. Other key catalysts include the recent collapse of U.S. banks, inflation, and amplified demand for alternative financial systems. That being said, market analysts have become far more optimistic on the future of Bitcoin, including:\n\nBitcoin Price Predictions 2024 : Dan Tapiero\n\nBitcoin coin with bull and stock chart. Bullish market of BTC-USD. Cryptos to buy.\n\nSource: Maxx-Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThree market analysts have emerged with bold predictions, anticipating Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by 2024. For example, crypto analyst Dan Tapiero says BTC could pass $100,000 during the latter half of 2024 or 2025. Tapiero shared his forecast during an interview with Scott Melker. In fact, according to Tapiero, Bitcoin may trade sideways for the duration of 2023. Shortly after, he expects to see $100,000 around the halving event. Among other contributing factors named by Tapiero was the adoption of blockchain technologies by states and companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBitcoin Price Predictions : Standard Chartered Bank\n\nVarious cryptocurrency coins.

This optimistic outlook is based on several factors, including the turmoil in the banking sector, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, and the expected conclusion of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hikes. Kendrick also highlights the nearing end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s tightening cycle as a favorable factor for Bitcoin\u2019s future performance. The correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq suggests that if there is a broader improvement in risk-on assets, Bitcoin is expected to trade more favorably.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 is considered a powerful catalyst that could contribute to future price increases. Additionally, regulatory changes aimed at facilitating investor access to the market, such as the introduction of digital asset ETFs and stablecoin regulations, could boost Bitcoin even more.\n\nPrediction 2024 : PlanB\n\nCrypto coins on a phone screen showing stats for various cryptocurrencies.. best cryptos\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock\n\nAccording to the pseudonymous analyst PlanB, known for his Stock-to-Flow (S2F) BTC price prediction model, Bitcoin will pass $100,000. PlanB also believes this will happen shortly after the next halving event. The model evaluation of Bitcoin\u2019s price is based on parameters such as scarcity and the relationship between BTC\u2019s existing supply and its production rate. PlanB states that the coin reached a cyclical low of $15,000 in Nov. during the FTX collapse. He suggests that in case Bitcoin reaches $32,000 shortly, the next possible price target of $100,000 can be reached soon after the 2024 halving event.\n\nJulia Magas is a writer who covers the latest trends in finance and technology.
