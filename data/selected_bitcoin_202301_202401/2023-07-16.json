        "title": "Billionaire Investor Tim Draper Is Super Bullish on Bitcoin. Here's How High He Thinks It Can Go. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If there's anyone who can spot the future trends in the world of technology, it's venture capitalist Tim Draper. Draper is a co-founder of the VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and has made hundreds of early investments in cutting-edge companies like Tesla.\n\nNow, the 65-year-old VC legend is making another big call on the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 0.97%) -- namely that it's about to take off. Here's how high Draper thinks the price can go.\n\nDelayed, but a big pop is coming\n\nDraper is not just a billionaire investor -- he's also been a Bitcoin enthusiast from the early years, when the token was still gaining traction. In 2014, Draper purchased 29,656 Bitcoin tokens that had been seized from the Silk Road online marketplace by U.S. Marshals. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was only $632, so Draper has already made an absolute killing.\n\nBut Draper thinks Bitcoin is just getting started. When it traded at around $4,000, Draper predicted that Bitcoin would be at $250,000 by now. While the price of Bitcoin currently hovers around $31,200, Draper is sticking to his prediction. \"I guess we have to wait a little longer (maybe two years), but engineers are hard at work,\" he tweeted not long ago.\n\nSo what's the holdup? Well, in a recent interview with Bloomberg, Draper said he is surprised by how opposed agencies of the U.S. government such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been toward the crypto industry.\n\nEarlier this year, the SEC sued Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, and then Coinbase, the large crypto exchange in the U.S. The SEC is adamant that many cryptocurrencies should be treated as securities and therefore regulated under the purview of the SEC although SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has acknowledged previously that Bitcoin is not a security.\n\n\"I thought that maybe they would be recognizing that they've gotta compete with the rest of the world,\" Draper told Bloomberg, adding that regulators are \"driving all the great entrepreneurs out.\"\n\nBut Draper believes that Bitcoin is here to stay for the long haul and that one day it will eventually become an everyday currency that will soon be more broadly accepted by retailers, which he thinks can reap many benefits from using the payments technology.\n\n\"I can't wait until I can raise a fund all in Bitcoin, invest it all in Bitcoin, have my portfolio companies paid in Bitcoin, and have taxes all paid in Bitcoin, and have the waterfall all fall into people's Bitcoin wallets,\" Draper said.\n\nWill Draper's prediction come true?\n\nObviously, Draper is not the first notable investor to predict that Bitcoin will rise significantly, but he certainly does have a tremendous track record of anticipating future trends. He's also clearly got skin in the game.\n\nI would agree with Draper that Bitcoin is here to stay, and I've said previously that it merits some exposure in one's portfolio, given that it does have a history of rising when the dollar drops and during difficult periods for the banking sector.\n\nHowever, I have no price prediction for the digital asset and am still unclear if everyone will be using it as a currency one day. Cryptocurrencies are hard to value as an asset, but given the continued adoption of Bitcoin in the mainstream financial system, I do envision a future with Bitcoin."

        "content": "Having slipped over the weekend, Bitcoin rose to trade at over US$30,300 on Monday morning in Asia. The price has now reverted to around the level posted last Thursday \u2014 prior to XRP issuer Ripple\u2019s favorable ruling in its lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The partial victory led to significant gains for a number of top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, with XRP still leading the gains. U.S. stock futures edged lower as investors await earnings reports from major banks.\n\nBitcoin falls back\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.05% over the last 24 hours to US$30,332.54 as of 06:30 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly gain of 0.65%, according to data from CryptoMarketCap.\n\nHowever, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency was trading at around US$31,300 early Saturday morning. Following that weekend high, the token\u2019s price reverted to roughly its pre-Ripple ruling level.\n\nIn a summary judgment Thursday, New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales of the XRP token on public exchanges do not constitute securities. The regulator first sued the San Francisco-based financial technology firm on the grounds that XRP constitutes a security in 2020.\n\nThe ruling was deemed something of a partial victory for Ripple, however, as the court ruled that XRP sales to institutional investors did violate securities laws.\n\n\u201cThere will be further court proceedings on that part \u2026 It is also not yet known if the SEC will appeal to the ruling,\u201d said Caroline Bowler, CEO of Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, in emailed comments. Therefore, there remains the \u201cpotential for more insecurity ahead for Ripple,\u201d Bowler added.\n\nNonetheless, Ripple Labs\u2019 XRP led the gainers Monday morning in Asia. It rose 5.58% to US$0.7577 for a weekly surge of 61.56%.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC has added BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to its official docket. That decision means that the regulator will now review the proposal in a serious manner.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackrock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with over US$9 trillion in assets, filed the application a little less than a month ago. The move saw the token\u2019s value breach the US$31,000 resistance level earlier this month as multiple major asset managers followed suit with similar ETF proposals.\n\nEther also gained 0.20% to US$1,934.09, rising 3.81% in the past seven days.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. The day\u2019s biggest losses were logged by Dogecoin, which dipped 2.53% to US$0.07. However, the token still recorded gains of 6.89% for the week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA also fell 2.52% to US$0.3185, limiting the coin\u2019s weekly gain to 12.08%. Similarly, Binance\u2019s BNB lost 2.43% to US$244.95. It is nonetheless trading at 4.68% higher than a week ago.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 0.16% in the past 24 hours to US$1.22 trillion, while trading volume fell 11.97% to US$24.91 billion.\n\nToken-gated access for the super-rich and The Flash via NFT\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.50% in the past 24 hours to 2,736.37 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. However, the index is down 0.40% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Solana and Cardano NFT market indices also moved higher, while the Ethereum and Polygon indices dropped.\n\n\u201cNFTs continue to ride the wave of positive news and positive prices in crypto,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cHowever we\u2019re not seeing any noteworthy gains in projects and instead most of the big names are still down for the past 7 days.\u201d\n\nThat is despite some large CryptoPunk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) sales in the past week. Those sales included BAYC #1734, which sold for $1.2m (600ETH), CryptoPunk #8531 for $1m (550 ETH), and CryptoPunk #9476 for $403k (217.5 ETH).\n\n\u201cBig sales sometimes trickle liquidity to other projects, but in this case, the seller may be pocketing their gains or investing in crypto, where opportunities seem brighter at the moment,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the total NFT transaction volume dipped 10.93% to US$16.58 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained Cards, the collection of NFTs used in Immutable\u2019s trading card game of the same name, topped the 24-hour transaction volume, despite edging down 0.43% to US$690,896.\n\nEthereum-based NFT staple BAYC placed second in Cryptoslam\u2019s collections ranking. Its total transaction volume rose 1.34% to US$660,415 in the past 24 hours. Bored Ape creator Yuga Labs announced last week that it will hold ApeFest \u2014 a celebratory event of its successful NFT collections \u2014 in Hong Kong in November.\n\nApeFest is going global.\n\nHong Kong.\n\nNov 3-5, 2023.https://t.co/Fxgb7RuVek pic.twitter.com/X2QVVd7Qxr \u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club (@BoredApeYC) July 13, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, non-blockchain sectors are also displaying increased NFT activity. .\n\nIndosuez, the global wealth management subsidiary of major French bank Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, launched a private NFT membership club last week named Le Clu3.

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole had roughly US$2.712 trillion in assets under management in 2022.\n\nElsewhere, Warner Bros.

Following the latest release of U.S. inflation data on July 12, which came in softer than expected, investors are hopeful that the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s extended round of interest rate hikes may soon draw to a close.\n\nHowever, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based brokerage firm FxPro, believes that recent positive investor sentiment may backfire.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has made sharp reversals before, but always after a spike in market volatility,\u201d Kuptsikevich said. \u201cSteadily rising stock prices are more likely to spur the central bank to tighten monetary policy further,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Fed is still looking to add more to its current interest rate of 5% to 5.25%. Christopher Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said last week at an event hosted by New York University that the central bank will need to enact two more 25-basis-point rate increases this year to tame inflation.\n\n\u201cThe robust strength of the labor market and the solid overall performance of the U.S. economy gives us room to tighten policy further,\u201d Waller said during the speech.\n\n\u201cIf inflation does not continue to show progress and there are no suggestions of a significant slowdown in economic activity, then a second 25-basis-point hike should come sooner rather than later, but that decision is for the future,\u201d Waller continued.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 96.1% chance the Fed will enact a 25-basis-point rate increase this month, up from 92.4% on Friday.\n\nLast week\u2019s earnings reports from major U.S. banks JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup added to the increasingly hopeful market sentiment. Investors now await reports from financial heavyweights including the Bank of America Corporation, Morgan Stanley & Co. and The Goldman Sachs Group. Earnings reports from Netflix, Tesla and United Airlines are also due Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, major stock indexes across Asia fell on Monday as China posted lower-than-expected economic growth of 6.3% for Q2. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all posted losses as of 12:00 p.m. in Hong Kong.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"

The day\u2019s biggest losses were logged by Dogecoin, which dipped 2.53% to US$0.07. However, the token still recorded gains of 6.89% for the week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA also fell 2.52% to US$0.3185, limiting the coin\u2019s weekly gain to 12.08%. Similarly, Binance\u2019s BNB lost 2.43% to US$244.95. It is nonetheless trading at 4.68% higher than a week ago.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 0.16% in the past 24 hours to US$1.22 trillion, while trading volume fell 11.97% to US$24.91 billion.\n\nToken-gated access for the super-rich and The Flash via NFT\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.50% in the past 24 hours to 2,736.37 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. However, the index is down 0.40% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Solana and Cardano NFT market indices also moved higher, while the Ethereum and Polygon indices dropped.\n\n\u201cNFTs continue to ride the wave of positive news and positive prices in crypto,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cHowever we\u2019re not seeing any noteworthy gains in projects and instead most of the big names are still down for the past 7 days.\u201d\n\nThat is despite some large CryptoPunk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) sales in the past week. Those sales included BAYC #1734, which sold for $1.2m (600ETH), CryptoPunk #8531 for $1m (550 ETH), and CryptoPunk #9476 for $403k (217.5 ETH).\n\n\u201cBig sales sometimes trickle liquidity to other projects, but in this case, the seller may be pocketing their gains or investing in crypto, where opportunities seem brighter at the moment,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the total NFT transaction volume dipped 10.93% to US$16.58 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained Cards, the collection of NFTs used in Immutable\u2019s trading card game of the same name, topped the 24-hour transaction volume, despite edging down 0.43% to US$690,896.\n\nEthereum-based NFT staple BAYC placed second in Cryptoslam\u2019s collections ranking. Its total transaction volume rose 1.34% to US$660,415 in the past 24 hours. Bored Ape creator Yuga Labs announced last week that it will hold ApeFest \u2014 a celebratory event of its successful NFT collections \u2014 in Hong Kong in November.\n\nApeFest is going global.\n\nHong Kong.\n\nNov 3-5, 2023.https://t.co/Fxgb7RuVek pic.twitter.com/X2QVVd7Qxr \u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club (@BoredApeYC) July 13, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, non-blockchain sectors are also displaying increased NFT activity. .\n\nIndosuez, the global wealth management subsidiary of major French bank Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, launched a private NFT membership club last week named Le Clu3. The club will cater to super-rich clients by offering token-gated access to secret sections of its website, among other otherwise off-limits experiences. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole had roughly US$2.712 trillion in assets under management in 2022.\n\nElsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. \u2014 the American entertainment conglomerate with over US$30 billion in market capitalization \u2014 has announced that it will launch its upcoming superhero film \u201cThe Flash\u201d via NFT. The launch is hosted by the Eluvio blockchain and will allow user access to the film itself, collectibles, bonus features and character artwork.\n\nIt\u2019s official, The Flash is the first new release movie to hit the blockchain! pic.twitter.com/sScukkA6Fw \u2014 Warner Bros.

Following the latest release of U.S. inflation data on July 12, which came in softer than expected, investors are hopeful that the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s extended round of interest rate hikes may soon draw to a close.\n\nHowever, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based brokerage firm FxPro, believes that recent positive investor sentiment may backfire.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has made sharp reversals before, but always after a spike in market volatility,\u201d Kuptsikevich said. \u201cSteadily rising stock prices are more likely to spur the central bank to tighten monetary policy further,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Fed is still looking to add more to its current interest rate of 5% to 5.25%. Christopher Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said last week at an event hosted by New York University that the central bank will need to enact two more 25-basis-point rate increases this year to tame inflation.\n\n\u201cThe robust strength of the labor market and the solid overall performance of the U.S. economy gives us room to tighten policy further,\u201d Waller said during the speech.\n\n\u201cIf inflation does not continue to show progress and there are no suggestions of a significant slowdown in economic activity, then a second 25-basis-point hike should come sooner rather than later, but that decision is for the future,\u201d Waller continued.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 96.1% chance the Fed will enact a 25-basis-point rate increase this month, up from 92.4% on Friday.\n\nLast week\u2019s earnings reports from major U.S. banks JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup added to the increasingly hopeful market sentiment. Investors now await reports from financial heavyweights including the Bank of America Corporation, Morgan Stanley & Co. and The Goldman Sachs Group. Earnings reports from Netflix, Tesla and United Airlines are also due Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, major stock indexes across Asia fell on Monday as China posted lower-than-expected economic growth of 6.3% for Q2. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all posted losses as of 12:00 p.m. in Hong Kong.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"
