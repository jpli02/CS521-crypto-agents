        "content": "The owner of crypto exchange Bitfinex is exploring a $150 million share buyback that would provide it with greater control over the private company\u2019s dealings, particularly as regulatory scrutiny on the industry heats up.\n\niFinex Inc., the Hong Kong-based firm which shares directors with crypto\u2019s largest stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings Ltd., wrote to shareholders on Sept. 22 with an offer of $10 per share for 15 million shares, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News. The deal, which represents around 9% of iFinex\u2019s outstanding capital and values the business at $1.7 billion, would depend on the business receiving an influx of cash from at least one of its subsidiaries, the proposal said."

        "title": "Digital Asset Recap Q3 2023: Bitcoin and Ether Outperform Wider Market Amid Regulatory Pressure and the Promise ... - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Over the past quarter, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization, declined -11%. Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed the broad benchmark by declining -10.9% while ether (ETH) underperformed, posting a loss of -12.5% for the last 3 months.\n\nIt's helpful to view these numbers in the context of their year-to-date performance, where Bitcoin has gained an impressive 64%, and Ether has risen by 41%. This underscores the resilience of these cryptocurrencies as some of the top-performing assets in 2023. This quarterly outperformance of BTC versus ETH and the broader CMI is a continuation of a trend we\u2019ve seen throughout the year. Institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to support BTC, while the continued regulatory pressure on alternative tokens drives the bifurcation in the crypto market between the established majors (Bitcoin and Ether) and other digital asset protocols and projects.\n\nSector-by-sector\n\nLooking within sector quarterly performance with the CoinDesk DACS framework, the trends and preferences towards larger capitalization tokens are less clear. Over Q3 of 2023, Computing (CPU, +3%) and DeFi sectors (DCF, -8%) were relative out-performers, while Smart Contract Platform (SMT, -13%), which contains Ether, and Culture and Entertainment (CNE, -22%) were relative under-performers. See the chart below for a full sector performance breakdown for Q3 of 2023.\n\nDACS Q3 2023 Performance (CDI Research)\n\nNews related to U.S. regulation was a key driver of price movements this quarter, with SEC actions featuring prominently in this. This followed regulatory enforcement action against Coinbase and Binance earlier in June. Meanwhile, regulatory filings for spot ETFs by some of the world's largest asset managers introduced a lot of price action ahead of potential approval dates.\n\nWhile July and August were relatively muted months for the market, September saw the outperformance of DeFi, Digitization and the Computing sector off the back of the partial Ripple court case win earlier in the month, and investor enthusiasm for AI, which propelled Chainlink (LINK), an on-chain data provider and the largest token of the Computing sector, to rise 24% for the month.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeptember also marked the one-year anniversary of Ethereum\u2019s successful transition to a \u201cProof-of-Stake\u201d consensus mechanism. This reduces the amount of computational work needed to verify blocks and transactions, effectively eliminating its carbon footprint. So far, the network has been operating as intended with staking assets becoming a popular way for crypto investors to enhance returns. CoinDesk Indices Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR), a metric used to proxy the expected income from Ethereum staking activities, averaged 4% (annualized) over the quarterly period, trending lower to end September at 3.6%.\n\nOne significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape in this quarter is the reduced level of risk, as defined by standard risk measures. We are now seeing lower levels of volatility, decreased correlation with traditional equities, and slightly reduced correlation among the top-30 tokens, as shown below.\n\nRolling Sector Correlations and Volatility (CDI Research)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shift could be an indication of a maturation of the market, as investors are becoming more discerning across token sectors, or it could be an artifact of market illiquidity, as trading volumes continue to decrease across large cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nWhere next?\n\nBond yields are rising sharply off of a relatively hawkish September FOMC, where the summary of economic projections (i.e. \u201cthe dot plot\u201d) eliminated the expectation for interest rate cuts in the near term. This dot plot guidance allowed the Federal Reserve to be clearer and more concise in indicating to the market that interest rates would have to be held higher for longer. While rising interest rates haven\u2019t immediately impacted the price of digital assets, the tightening of financial conditions and strengthening of the U.S. dollar should be expected to add further headwinds to the price appreciation for crypto currencies. Coincidentally, the CoinDesk Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators have registered neutral to slightly negative trend signals over the first few days of Q4.\n\nA catalyst to break through the macroeconomic headwinds of tightening financial conditions could come in the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nWhy?\n\nFirstly, it would greatly enhance accessibility, allowing a broader range of investors to easily gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct purchase and storage, like how gold ETFs, starting in the early-2000s, simplified the process of gaining exposure to physical gold. This in turn could shift and diversify the investor base in cryptocurrencies, from tech-savvy enthusiasts to more mainstream, longer-term investors seeking diversification, which could result in a reduction in volatility across the digital asset market.\n\nAdditionally, the ETF structure would facilitate easier institutional adoption, delegating asset acquisition and storage to qualified custodians, making it more familiar and regulated for institutional investors like hedge funds and pension funds.\n\nFinally, a Bitcoin ETF will allow investors to allocate a portion of their assets to Bitcoin as a store of value or an uncorrelated asset class. This could result in a significant influx of capital into the cryptocurrency market, marking the maturation of Bitcoin from a niche asset class to a regulated and accepted part of the traditional financial system."

        "title": "The Bitcoin 16 Year Cycle, And Its Correlation To The Internet Bubble - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Everyone has heard about the 4-year cycle that Bitcoin is going through, but have you ever thought of the idea that Bitcoin might be going through a bigger cycle? And could this bigger cycle reflect the way humans adopt new technologies? And is it possible we have seen something similar before with another technology like the internet? In this article, we will be diving into a new theory that suggests that Bitcoin is moving through a larger 16-year cycle which can help us predict the direction of the Bitcoin price in the coming years.\n\nThe Regular 4 Year Cycle\n\nBitcoin tends to go through 4-year cycles which are divided into 2 parts, the uptrend and the downtrend. A regular 4-year cycle consists of a 3-year uptrend followed by a 1-year downtrend also known as a bear market. So far Bitcoin has completed 4-year cycles and they\u2019ve shown incredible accuracy which catches the attention of the market participants.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nThe DOTCOM Cycle\n\nOne can\u2019t ignore the similarities between the market structure of the S&P500 during the DOTCOM cycle and the Bitcoin cycle. The regular financial markets also went through clear 4-year cycles with the majority of the cycle being in an uptrend and the downtrend, also known as a bear market, shortly lived. From my perspective, the DOTCOM cycle started around 1986 as this was the moment that Microsoft went public, one of the biggest companies of the DOTCOM cycle. The first 3 4-year cycles of Bitcoin look very similar to the first 3 4-year cycles of the S&P500 starting from 1986.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nThis really spiked my interests as both periods are based on the adoption of a completely new technology that shifts the way our society perceives and uses information. The personal computer and the internet changed our lives completely to the point that it\u2019s almost unthinkable to be unconnected to the internet for more than 24 hours. In the future it will as well be unthinkable to not own and use any Bitcoin, we\u2019re just still in the early phase of its adoption.\n\nSo could the structure of the DOTCOM cycle help us to determine a potential path for Bitcoin? First of all, I would like to emphasize the fact that market cycles in my honest opinion are one of the best ways to use rough price predictions and ascertaining when to enter and when to exit a particular market. But I really want to emphasize the word \u201crough\u201d. There goes a saying, \u201chistory\n\ndoesn\u2019t repeat itself but it sure does rhyme\u201d, and I think this applies to cycles too. Nothing is ever a 100% replication of anything that happened before, but it can give us a rough estimate of what might happen.\n\nAs you can see in the structure of the DOTCOM cycle, the first 3 4-year cycles are very similar, a long bull market followed by a short but sometimes shallow bear market or correction. It's only that the last 4-year cycle is different, the tables are flipped upside down. It starts with an acceleration in the price which doesn\u2019t last that long and is followed by a multi-year long bear market. Could Bitcoin do something similar, disappointing the ones who expect a regular 4-year cycle and surprise the majority with a multi-year-long bear market?\n\nMicrosoft is following a similar path. It starts with 3 4-year cycles that are right-translated, followed by a 4-year cycle that is left-translated, so a prolonged bear market in an asset that has been in a strong bull market for years.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nMicrosoft topped in the year 2000, marking a long-term top in the price at approximately $60. And it wasn't until 2015 that that level was broken again. It took 15 years from that high to completely recover and surpass that level again. If we were to take the money supply into consideration it actually takes longer for Microsoft to recover and break the high 21 years later in May 2021.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nBoth of these charts, Microsoft and the S&P500, really demonstrate the magnitude of a correction after a prolonged bull-market. It\u2019s challenging to imagine from one's perspective a prolonged bear market of an asset you\u2019ve experienced mostly going up. Is it possible that we\u2019re going to see, in rough terms, something similar with Bitcoin?\n\nConfluence Between Cycles\n\nSo let\u2019s have a look at what these cycles are forecasting for Bitcoin and how we potentially could prepare for these outcomes. First of all, it's interesting to note that one date is forecasting the same outcome in the regular 4-year cycle, the 16-year cycle.\n\nA regular 4-year cycle would suggest that we\u2019re staying in an uptrend until 2025, followed by a 1- year decline. This is a typical 4-year cycle which we\u2019ve seen 3 times in the history of Bitcoin.\n\nThe 16-year cycle would suggest that we would follow a similar path as the DOTCOM bubble as mentioned above. Bitcoin would peak within the first half of the cycle, so by the latest at the end of 2024, this would be followed by a multi-year-long decline going into 2026 to form new lows.\n\nHow To Spot A Top\n\nOne of the best indicators a Bitcoin trader can use are the Bitcoin funding rates. The funding rates are showing basically whether the majority of the market participants on derivative markets are shorting or longing for Bitcoin. I\u2019ve found this indicator very useful to spot a top in the Bitcoin price as in a healthy bull market when the funding rates are negative, the price tends to trend up. In a bear market, when the funding is positive, the price tends to decline. So we can use this metric to spot which market conditions the market is trading in and if anything has changed. One of the first signals when Bitcoin entered a bear market in 2022 was that the price of Bitcoin was declining with negative funding rates, and that does generally not happen in a healthy bull market.\n\nAnother way to look for the cycle top is timing, whenever Bitcoin is in the period of topping for let\u2019s say the 16-year cycle and we break below a swing-low, chances increase that a cycle top is in. This would then be invalidated by breaking back above that specific level, to re-claim this level. To view the period of a potential cycle top, one can have a look at the Bitcoin cycles progression bars. Once the yellow dot enters the red zone, it means that based on that specific cycle we are in the topping period. Again, it is important to mention that cycles can help to give a rough estimate of potential outcomes, they often don\u2019t unfold very accurately and there is room\n\nFurther Considerations\n\nThere are more factors at play here that influence the price of Bitcoin other than these cycles. The fact that the Federal Reserve started to print huge amounts of money in 2020, really spiked the risk appetite for many investors to look for a safe haven like the financial markets and Bitcoin. It\u2019s very clear that the moment the Federal Reserve started to inject money into the economy, the price of Bitcoin and the financial markets started to go up until the money printer halted again in 2022 and the price of Bitcoin entered a 1-year declining phase. These fundamental changes in the economy will most likely have an impact on Bitcoin and the way these cycles could unfold.\n\nChart from Blockchain.com\n\nThis is a guest post by Jeroen van Lang.
