        "content": "The past 24 hours saw the majority of altcoins crash by a considerable margin and there are no signs of slowing down.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s also a clear discrepancy between the price performance of certain altcoins to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which have remained relatively resilient.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Soars\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance increased to around 46% (data from CoinGecko). This is a major difference. The metric tracks Bitcoin\u2019s share relative to that of the rest of the market and is a clear indication of the dynamic between both.\n\nWhen the BTC dominance rises, it means BTC\u2019s price is performing better than the altcoin market.\n\nNow, the major cryptocurrency is down 3.1% on the day, which is definitely not good news, but the rest of the market is performing a lot worse. This is why the dominance is increasing.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets. Start receiving this recap, for free, every day: Invalid email address Your privacy is guranteed. Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!\n\nAltcoins Suffering Tremendously\n\nCardano, Solana, Polygon, and a lot of other major altcoins are trading well in the red, as seen in the following heatmap.\n\nThe main reason behind the plummet seems to be the fact that the SEC has listed a lot of them as securities in their latest lawsuit against Coinbase. Another major trading platform \u2013 Robinhood, also announced plans to start delisting some altcoins in consideration of the above.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that those cryptocurrencies that haven\u2019t been named in the SEC\u2019s claim are performing a bit better. For instance, Ethereum\u2019s ETH is down only about 5%, while Ripple\u2019s XRP is down around 6%. This is still a lot, but it\u2019s nowhere near the 20% (and more) that coins like ADA< SOL, and MATIC, among others, lost today."

        "content": "THIMPHU -- The tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, known for its Gross National Happiness development indicator, is embarking on a cryptocurrency mining project as it aspires to build a 21st-century economy.\n\nThe country has teamed up with Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer Technologies Group, based in Singapore, to develop a 600 megawatt mining farm for Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency. Bitdeer was due to establish a closed-end fund at the end of May, aimed at raising $500 million from international investors for the project. A high-level source close to the project confirmed that the fundraising drive indeed began as planned.\n\n\"While Bhutan faces geographical constraints and connectivity challenges, being landlocked and mountainous, its green and relatively cheaper power provides an opportunity to invest in digital assets to build a more connected and sustainable economy,\" said Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), the government investment arm that is partnering with Bitdeer.\n\n\"In doing so, it will deepen local knowledge and engagement in the rapidly evolving technology landscape and equip citizens to participate in the modern global economy from within Bhutan.\"\n\nThe move into crypto mining, a notoriously volatile and controversial industry, comes as the country is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which shrank the economy by 10% in 2020. Foreign currency reserves have declined, nonperforming loans in the manufacturing and tourism sectors have increased and youth unemployment reached 29% last year.\n\nThis has cast a shadow over Bhutan's \"development success story,\" in the words of the World Bank, with an estimated 12.4% of the population of around 786,000 living below the national poverty line last year, up from 8.2% in 2017, according to government surveys.\n\nGrowth is forecast at 4.6% this year. But tourism, the country's second-largest revenue earner, is not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025 because of new regulations and a slow recovery in global travel.\n\nThe government hopes to diversify, on the way to building a high-income economy in the next decade. It is looking at opportunities not only in blockchain-based currencies but also fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics and biotechnology. The education system is also being reformed to emphasize critical thinking, creativity and digital literacy, with coding lessons for students aged 8 and up.\n\nFor crypto miners, Bhutan's green and relatively low-cost energy supply, mainly from hydropower, makes it an attractive destination.\n\n\"We are excited to be working alongside DHI in accessing Bhutan's zero-emissions power to sustainably enable the blockchain technologies that will eventually form an immutable bedrock for a global store of value,\" said Jihan Wu, chairman of Bitdeer Technologies Group, in a media release earlier in May.\n\nMining operations accounting for the first 100 MW are expected to begin this September, before reaching 600 MW in the next three years. Power will be sold to the operator at a negotiated rate.\n\nAt 100 MW, the project would be country's single largest energy consumer, while at 600 MW it would use more energy than the rest of the nation combined. Bhutan's peak demand was recorded at around 488 MW in December 2021, according to records with the Bhutan Power Corporation.\n\nFarm produce for sale along the Thimphu-Paro highway: More than 50% of the Bhutanese population is engaged in agriculture. (Photo by Phuntsho Wangdi)\n\nBhutan has an installed capacity of about 2,400 MW and sells most of its river hydro generation to India in the summer. In winter, it imports electricity when generation dwindles to about 414 MW. But the consistent supply is set to increase once a new 118 MW power plant comes online later this year, and a 1,020 MW facility opens in October 2024.\n\nFor now, the seasonal variation in power generation has been considered in the Bitdeer agreement, with domestic requirements to receive first priority and operations to shut in winter when generation dips.\n\nAlthough Bhutan's equity in the project will be small, the arrangement promises to create a source of dollars from the sale of power, taxes and profit-sharing. The plan is to use the funds to further strengthen the electric grid and telecom network.\n\nThe project is also expected to create between 300 to 400 jobs for Bhutanese and open up a \"whole new vertical within which we can set up resource centers to look more closely at blockchain and asset design, and communicate with our university to build R&D projects,\" said DHI's Dahal.\n\nThe excitement, however, comes with some trepidation over using national resources to enter an unpredictable industry that few truly understand. Other countries that have jumped into crypto mining have run into problems. In the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, a sudden boom in crypto mining strained the power grid, leading to localized blackouts and contributing to the protests that rocked the country in January 2022.\n\nSome countries, including former industry leader China, have banned mining because of the vast amounts of energy needed to sustain the operations.\n\nThen there is the volatility of the currencies to consider. In 2021, the value of Bitcoin crashed from $68,000 to $17,000. This year it was back above $30,000 at one point.\n\nIn April, Bhutan's DHI itself came under fire when the bankruptcy of BlockFi, a crypto trading platform, revealed that it had been secretly investing and trading in digital assets. Dahal acknowledged that Bhutan had entered the market when Bitcoin was trading at around $5,000 in 2019.\n\nThe 17th-century Tashichho Dzong in the Thimphu valley is the seat of Bhutan's central government, which aims to create a high-income economy in the next decade. (Photo by Phuntsho Wangdi)\n\nDahal insisted that DHI is aware of the pitfalls. \"We have a robust risk framework in place, and we need to take care of what is under our control, which is to operate the mine as efficiently as possible,\" he said. \"And with Bitdeer as our partner, we are confident of being able to do that well.\"\n\nMany in Bhutan view Bitcoin mining as a risk worth taking, since the currency's finite supply makes it a rare commodity -- and therefore desirable, at least in theory. Of the 21 million possible Bitcoins, more than 19 million have already been mined, a fact expected to pump up demand for the remainder. Many are also counting on cryptocurrencies becoming mainstream.\n\n\"When it comes to crypto mining, Bhutan should get into it,\" said Tshering Cigay, the former CEO of the Thimphu Techpark, an IT development hub. He said that during his tenure, Techpark received several international proposals for setting up mining farms.\n\n\"Bhutan should take advantage of its competitive edge and diversify its energy market,\" Cigay said, although he cautioned, \"When it comes to trading, it is hard to say.\""
