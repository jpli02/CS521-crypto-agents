        "content": "The equity lifeline used by many Bitcoin miners to help weather the most recent crypto winter is beginning to irk some shareholders.\n\nThe 12 major publicly-traded miners, including Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc., raised about $440 million through stock sales in the second quarter, a jump of almost 60% from the previous three months, according to data complied by TheMinerMag. The companies have raised over $4.9 billion since the start of 2021. The cash pile has helped participants in the capital-intensive industry stay afloat after Bitcoin\u2019s 2022 rout resulted in a loss of access for many to debt and lending markets."

        "content": "Empowered Funds is seeking to launch three bitcoin futures ETFs using the ARK Invest Management and 21Shares brands, as firms look to tap into investor demand for cryptocurrency products.\n\nEmpowered is a subsidiary of Alpha Architect, which offers 15 ETFs with nearly $1.9 billion in assets. The firm filed to issue the exchange-traded funds with the SEC earlier this month and will be the advisor to the funds. 21Shares and ARK, which have teamed up on other bitcoin ETF applications, will perform subadvisor roles.\n\nFirms like BlackRock Inc., Fidelity, and Invesco have been rushing to roll out digital asset ETF products as the Securities and Exchange Commission faces mounting pressure to greenlight an array of cryptocurrency funds. The Empowered fund filings come as a slew of firms, including ARK and 21Shares, await approval for a spot bitcoin ETF. Empowered is seeking to launch ETFs that track bitcoin futures contracts, as opposed to spot ETFs that track physical bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin ETFs on the Horizon\n\nThe ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Futures ETF will invest in bitcoin futures contracts and serve as the underlying fund for the other two products set to launch. The ARK 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF will allocate at least 25% of its assets in its Digital Asset and Blockchain Strategy ETF. The third ETF, the ARK 21Shares Digital Asset and Blockchain Strategy ETF, will also invest in the Active Bitcoin Futures ETF. The funds can also invest in Treasury securities, according to their prospectus.\n\nWhile investors are anticipating a spot bitcoin decision, other firms are taking advantage of increased interest in the space to launch new products. The first and largest futures bitcoin fund is the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which has $955 million in assets.\n\nProShares saw significant first-mover benefits by being the first to launch a bitcoin futures ETF, seeing millions in deposits on the first day it hit the market. Some speculate the SEC will approve multiple spot bitcoins at once to avoid one firm getting the vast majority of market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "title": "Bitcoin ordinals inscriptions climbing steadily despite lull in prices - CNBC",
        "content": "Ordinals inscriptions have been consistently higher this summer while the price of bitcoin was in a lull. The number of ordinals recorded onto the bitcoin blockchain has spiked above 400,000 three times since July 30, surpassing the May high of 400,091, according to Dune Analytics. Twice in July the number jumped above 385,000. Ordinals are a new protocol that makes it possible to store and trade digital content on the bitcoin blockchain. The idea is similar to NFTs, barring some technical differences, and investors are excited about their ability to bring utility to the Bitcoin network beyond just trading its native token. \"The number of ordinals being inscribed is still going pretty solidly up and to the right,\" said Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a bitcoin developer tools company. \"People just want to be putting content and inscribing things onto the Bitcoin chain, which is why we're climbing at a steady rate.\" Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin is driven more by larger, more macro-level developments, he added. Ordinals first launched in February. Ordinals saw their first big spike in May, which led to a parabolic increase in bitcoin transaction fees . Given the newness of the idea, however, it's anyone's guess what it's adoption trajectory will be \u2014 especially given the former hype and uncertainty around their cousins, NFTs. Although NFTs have a wide range of potential utility, they became largely known as digital art and a concept lost on many. The recent ramp in ordinals activity came amid a pullback in NFT trading, Miller explained. Bitcoin transaction fee activity has been more muted in recent weeks. \"Transaction fees went crazy high because people were running large inscriptions, especially the initial setup ones for BRC-20 coins,\" Miller explained about the first spike this year. \"The inscriptions of late have been smaller and more efficient.\" That's due in part to a technical feature that allows users to save space on chain when recording data by referencing other existing inscriptions. These \"recursive inscriptions\" both \"make the art that you're seeing now, but the other thing is people are using this to figure out different ways to use the underlying technology that can get recombined and reused in different ways in the future for no- art based things as well.\""

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crypto tokens were trading higher in Thursday's trade ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's talk on the economic outlook at the Jackson Hole meeting.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher, around $1.07 trillion, up 1.55% in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin (BTC) rose 1.62% to $26,475, whereas its largest peer, Ethereum, surged nearly 2% and regained the $1,650 level. Meanwhile, BTC volume in the last 24 hours stood at approximately $16.09 billion, rising 1.76% in the last 24 hours.\"For the market to turn bullish again, a breach of $28,400 resistance by Bitcoin is necessary in the coming weeks. Markets await US Fed Chair Powell\u2019s speech at an annual conference this Friday to determine its direction with clarity on macro-economic trends,\" Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus Crypto Platform, said.The market cap of bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $515 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 48.36%, an increase of 0.07% over the day, according to CoinMarketCap.Bitcoin has been trading above the $26000 level. This could be indicative of the market awaiting a decision on the Bitcoin-ETF in the US, Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder of Mudrex said.Ethereum continues to trade above the $1600 mark. Altcoins like Stellar and Hedera saw more than 5% growth in the last 24 hours. This renewed interest in altcoins and AI-related cryptocurrencies could be because of AI and computer-chip giant Nvidia reporting Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion versus consensus estimates of $11.19 billion, Edul said.Bitcoin's recent sideways movement following a significant drop on August 17th indicates uncertainty among both bullish and bearish participants. Consequently, it's wise to await a breakout before making substantial trading decisions.The elongated lower shadow on Bitcoin's candlestick chart for August 22nd is a positive signal, suggesting strong efforts from bulls to defend the $24,800 support level. Nonetheless, bullish momentum will remain subdued until the price surpasses the resistance levels at $26,833 and subsequently the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $27,777.

The S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures both posted gains.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s gains received a boost from Nvidia share prices that gained over 3% after the chipmaker\u2019s earnings report showed that its data center revenue rising 171% year over year to US$10.32 billion.\n\nNvidia\u2019s earnings report also provided fuel for European equity markets, with Frankfurt\u2019s DAX 40 gaining 1% and the pan-European STOXX 600 inching up 0.9% on Thursday.\n\nOn the corporate front, investors are anticipating earnings reports from Intuit, the Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto Dominion Bank, NetEase and Marvell Technology, scheduled for later today.\n\nInvestors are also looking ahead to key speeches by U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday where central bank leaders will converge.\n\nSee related article: Singapore\u2019s Stablecoin framework, Australia\u2019s crypto landscape & Binance shuts \u2018Connect\u2019\n\nUpdates with equities"
