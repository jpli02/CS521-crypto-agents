        "content": "The total fees paid for Ordinal inscriptions topped 272 BTC, around $7.6 million on Tuesday, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard. On Monday alone, over 372,000 inscriptions were created on the Bitcoin network\u2014contributing to a daily record 682,281 Bitcoin transactions\u2014with daily network fees hitting 23 BTC, or around $656,000.\n\nI can't believe my eyes BRC-20 demand leading to a 700% increase in fees AFTER what we've seen with Ordinal Inscriptions 12,800% increase in fees from BEFORE Ordinal Inscriptions launched 300,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool pic.twitter.com/oyLceu6ODe \u2014 trevor.btc @ NYC (@TO) May 2, 2023\n\n\u201cMost of the acceleration is BRC-20,\u201d Trevor Owens, Managing Partner at Bitcoin Frontier Fund, told Decrypt. The BRC-20 token standard made minting tokens and meme coins on the Bitcoin network possible, clearing the path for over 1 million more inscriptions to be added to the over 2.5 million already on the Bitcoin network in less than a week.\n\nIntroduced in March, BRC-20\u2014or Bitcoin Request for Comment number 20\u2014allowed the creation of fungible tokens using the Ordinals protocol launching a new wave of interest in minting NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBut while JPEGs are flooding the network, most inscriptions are still text-based.\n\n\u201cText inscriptions are lower cost since you pay based on the size of the data,\u201d Owens said. \u201cSo they are low-cost high volume, whereas JPEGs and digital media is high cost, low volume.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the memory usage on the Bitcoin network is over 650 MB, double the initial 300 MB capacity, indicating a higher demand for computer memory due to the increased transactions and fuller blocks, according to data from Mempool. This increase may make running a node more challenging, but Ordinals proponents say it secures and strengthens the network.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAs long as the value gained from minting BRC-20 tokens is higher than the value lost to the inscription fees, we will see fees on Bitcoin continue to climb,\u201d pseudonymous Twitter user @LeonidasNFT said, adding that higher fees on Bitcoin are a very good thing.\n\n\u201cIt indicates strong demand for Bitcoin\u2019s block space, which is critical for the long-term success of the protocol,\u201d Leonidas said. \u201cThe days of only using Bitcoin to transfer BTC to your hardware wallet once every few years have come to an end.\u201d\n\nBitcoin NFT Mints Surpass 200K\u2014But Is Interest in Ordinals Fading?\n\nHigh fees benefit the Bitcoin blockchain by incentivizing miners, prioritizing valuable transactions, and enhancing network security. However, while loading up the Bitcoin blockchain with JPEGs and sending fees skyrocketing may be good for miners and the network\u2019s security, it puts a higher price tag on transactions on the network.\n\n\u201cIn February, we inscribed the Taproot Wizards collection, which took over 80MB of Bitcoin block space,\u201d Taproot Wizards tweeted. \u201cBut now bitcoin transaction fees are so high, that if we tried inscribing the 80MB of wizards today, the fees would\u2019ve cost us 32 BTC. Almost $1 million dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is the best thing that could have happened to Bitcoin,\u201d Owens said, pointing out that the launch and development of Ordinals did not require changing the Bitcoin base protocol. \u201cWe\u2019ve unlocked new use cases to bring in liquidity, new users, and lots of developers making Bitcoin more valuable through better user experience and more use cases is what we need to reach mass adoption.\u201d"

        "title": "Can Bitcoin's Halving Events Point to a Future Cryptocurrency Market Rally? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "In a landscape as volatile as crypto, there are very few trends that investors can follow with any degree of certainty. Despite its erratic nature, one of the cryptocurrency ecosystem\u2019s strongest trends has revolved around Bitcoin\u2019s halving events every four years.\n\nThe coin went on to smash through its all-time high values in the months that followed its previous halving events, and now with the next one set for 2024, could investors expect a fresh rally?\n\nThere are many reasons for cryptocurrency market speculators to be excited for a prospective Bitcoin (BTC) halving event. The market dominance of BTC means that any price rallies for the world\u2019s most famous crypto asset means that the entirety of the market is likely to experience a major bull run.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s stock-to-flow model (where stock is the total existing supply of a commodity\u2014or a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and flow is the new supply of the commodity or crypto that is created each year) shows, the cryptocurrency peaks at roughly the same stage in its halving cycle.\n\nShould this trend continue, we may see BTC surpass its most recent all-time high market values of November 2021 and soar to a considerably higher market price. But just how reliable is this metric? And what does a halving event actually involve? Let\u2019s take a deeper look at Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycles and what they actually mean for investors:\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Halving Event?\n\nBitcoin undergoes a halving event approximately every four years. This sees the block rewards distributed to Bitcoin miners halve, hence its name.\n\nThis process will continue for many years until around the year 2140, when the total supply of BTC of 21 million is finally reached.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving events are significant because they mark another drop in the rate of new Bitcoins being produced on the way to reaching its total supply. At present, the number of BTC in circulation stands at just over 19.3 million, indicating that there are fewer than 1.7 million left to mine.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was launched in 2009, the reward for each block mined was 50 BTC, but the first halving event in 2012 saw this supply halved to 25. Subsequently, the 2016 halving event saw rewards cut to 12.5, and finally 6.25 in the most recent halving event on May 11, 2020.\n\nHowever, as the chart shows, each halving event brought a fresh Bitcoin rally in its wake. Following Bitcoin\u2019s 2016 halving, months of accumulation resulted in a new all-time high of $19,783.21 on December 17, 2017.\n\nIn the wake of the 2017 rally, Bitcoin and the wider market descended into a crypto winter until the 2020 halving event, which ultimately paved the way for a fresh all-time high of $69,044.77 in November 2021.\n\nSince its most recent peak, Bitcoin has descended into another crypto winter with harsh economic headwinds forcing the cryptocurrency to retrace at a significant rate. But should investors be optimistic for 2024\u2019s next halving?\n\nWhile Bitcoin is often referred to as \u2018digital gold,\u2019 the notion of the supply of gold being halved every four years would lead to unimaginable price rises. Should demand for Bitcoin continue to grow, this would logically mean that Bitcoin would continue to become more scarce in the face of demand.\n\nIs Bitcoin Heading to the Moon?\n\nWhile there are certainly a number of caveats to keep in mind, there\u2019s plenty of optimism that market commentators are drawing from Bitcoin\u2019s halving events.\n\n\u201c$180k; that\u2019s the target,\u201d stated Decentrader Crypto Analytics Founder \u2018FilbFilb\u2019 on Twitter. The user, who has amassed a following of more than 85,000 on Twitter, has based their calculations heavily on the Bitcoin halving event, which they believe will be a catalyst for a fresh all-time high for the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cBitcoin halving is due for March 2024. If history is anything to go off then you have 18 months absolute max\u2026before we start doing all sorts of crazy stuff above the all-time high again,\u201d FilbFilb added.\n\nThis sentiment has also been echoed by famous CryptoQuant Analyst \u2018Plan B.\u2019 As a user who frequently utilizes Bitcoin\u2019s stock-to-flow model, Plan B took to Twitter to say that their metrics indicated a BTC value of over $32,000 at the time of Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 halving event, and an eventual 2025 bull market which will see BTC reach values in excess of $100,000.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin hasn\u2019t attained a value of more than $30,000 since June 2022, predictions of beyond $100k appear ambitious at first glance, but they\u2019re shared across the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIf the block rewards get cut in half to 3.125 from 6.25, then the price has got to double-ish in order for the miners to continue to make money,\u201d said Hedge Fund Manager Mark Yusko. \u201cTraditional assets are driven by economic growth, Fed policies, inflation. Crypto is driven by the technology itself, millennial adoption,\u201d Yusko added, noting that \u2018the laws of math\u2019 dictates that the upcoming halving event can push Bitcoin beyond $100,000.\n\nEmbracing a Changing Market\n\nIn cryptocurrency, perhaps more so than anywhere else, past performance should never be a guarantee for future performance. Bitcoin\u2019s halving event has held a strong correlation with market-wide rallies, but the most recent path to a new Bitcoin all-time high was buoyed by remarkably low Fed interest rates moving away from the Covid-19 pandemic which led to far greater levels of liquidity among investors.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally was less pronounced than those before it, indicating that halving events may be weakening.\n\nHistorically, the cryptocurrency markets have maintained a correlation with traditional tech stocks. With this in mind, traders can generally look to the Nasdaq-100\u2019s performance to anticipate a change of fortunes in the likes of Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional adoption can help to stabilize the volatility of Bitcoin, leading to better market sentiment and higher price rallies. The arrival of more institutions into the crypto landscape will also demand a more sophisticated market, powered by decentralized finance applications. In turn, paving the way for crypto\u2019s transition into more mainstream markets.\n\nSKARB offers a driving force for change within the cryptocurrency landscape for institutions, mitigating the prospect of counterparty risk in an ecosystem that\u2019s been blighted by the high-profile collapses of exchanges like FTX. Should a counterparty fail for whatever reason, it can result in high-profile reputational and economic damage, as well as causing institutions to lose out in terms of time, effort and productivity.\n\nThe unified system offered by SKARB empowers institutions by acting as an all-in-one toolset for trading across several popular exchanges. While upholding maximum levels of encryption, institutions will have the freedom to utilize the SKARB terminal to execute trades via a vast range of market makers.\n\nThrough consolidating all trades within one single app-based terminal, SKARB also enables institutions to effectively audit themselves as they build into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, helping them to become more efficient and effective. It\u2019s through platforms like this that institutional acceptance and greater crypto market stability can be assured.\n\nLooking to 2024\n\nIt certainly pays to err on the side of caution when it comes to identifying trends in crypto. However, Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycles point to one of the only trends on the market that\u2019s occurred three times and delivered fresh all-time highs each time.\n\nAlthough times are changing at a rapid pace in the world of cryptocurrency, decentralized finance and Web 3.0, the prospect of Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming price accumulation could be worth exploring on a deeper scale for institutional investors. Although there\u2019s certainly risk, Bitcoin\u2019s continued ability to confound its critics deserves more attention.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Why Is Bitcoin Going Back Up? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Throughout 2022, the economy at large saw some turbulence. But the cryptocurrency market, in particular, experienced a downward slide from its epic heights in 2021. Even the oldest surviving cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, saw its value tumble from over $60,000 to under $17,000.\n\nInvestors interested in cryptocurrency couldn\u2019t help but wonder when Bitcoin\u2019s value would bounce back. That time seems to have finally come. Bitcoin saw its price surge 20% in March, leading many to wonder what changed. This article will explore why this reversal is happening and whether we think it will continue.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nCurrently trading around $28,000, Bitcoin has recovered almost $10,000 in value since its trough at the beginning of 2023.\n\nMany factors contributed to the falling price of Bitcoin, including generally adverse economic conditions.\n\nWith some of the factors that pushed the price down now reversed, the value of Bitcoin is rising. Only time will tell if the trend continues.\n\nA Short History of Bitcoin\n\nWhen Bitcoin hit the market in 2009, it was unclear what to expect from an investment perspective. However, that didn\u2019t stop investors who understood the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential from jumping in.\n\nIn July 2010, Bitcoin saw its first big jump in price to $0.09. But the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency led to significant swings along the way. When we fast forward to 2020, Bitcoin started climbing to an all-time high of $67,566 in November 2021.\n\nOf course, this extreme spike in value had many investors excited. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want to add such a high-performing asset to their portfolio? Unfortunately for some investors, jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon in 2021 would become a big mistake.\n\nBitcoin in 2022\n\nSince that peak of roughly $68,000, Bitcoin has taken a tumble. In mid-November 2022, the cryptocurrency\u2019s value fell to around $16,700. That meant Bitcoin had lost over 70% of its value from a year before.\n\nBitcoin prices seemed bleak in 2022 compared to the previous year\u2019s highs. But compared to prices from 2019, the asset had still increased in value even at its end-of-2022 low point.\n\nWhat Pushed Bitcoin Down?\n\nAlthough Bitcoin\u2019s value experienced such a dramatic tumble in 2022, many seasoned crypto investors were used to the extreme volatility of this asset class. And the reality is that Bitcoin was not the only asset to see shocking volatility amidst 2022\u2019s market conditions.\n\nIf you\u2019re not someone who keeps tabs on the general economy, 2022 was a wild ride. Many factors hurting stock investors and everyday households also contributed to the volatility in the crypto market.\n\nOne of the major issues facing the economy was high levels of inflation. Inflation is typically caused by a mismatch of supply and demand. Companies will raise prices if demand for goods is unusually high or something interrupts supply chains. When an increase in prices is widespread across the economy, the Federal Reserve steps in.\n\nThe Federal Reserve approved a series of aggressive rate hikes across 2022 to curb inflation. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and reduce consumers\u2019 discretionary spending. People save more and often sell off investments, anticipating poor performance from companies.\n\nCryptocurrency suffered plenty of bad press in 2022 due to the fallout of FTX. The collapse of the crypto exchange led to a loss of over $1 billion in consumer funds. Whenever a failure like this happens, crypto markets tend to suffer as investors are increasingly skeptical of the asset\u2019s stability.\n\nThe war between Ukraine and Russia also strained the global political world in 2022. Plus, mid-term elections kept the U.S. political landscape uneasy. These factors contributed to the financial turmoil we saw, which likely caused the negative slide in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nHowever, historically, there has been an underlying debate about the inherent value of Bitcoin. Some investors are wary of using Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, while others are more confident that another coin, like Ethereum, might surpass Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness at some point.\n\nThe Value of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency representing an alternative to \u201cnormal\u201d fiat currency. A central bank controls fiat money, and it has value because the government decrees it has value. Consumers widely use it, and its value isn\u2019t tied to a specific commodity, like the gold standard.\n\nDespite being located in a digital space, it\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoins are limited in their supply and have an associated cost of production. Some people compare Bitcoins to precious metals because of their limited economic use. For example, you can\u2019t use Bitcoin or physical gold to pay at most retail stores.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin does have certain advantages over other currencies. Bitcoin is more mobile than paper money or precious metals because it\u2019s not physical. Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology is decentralized and validated by various independent nodes. This makes Bitcoin particularly resistant to fraud efforts like counterfeiting.\n\nUntil people use Bitcoin in more commercial activities, most consumers will likely be skeptical of its value as money. If you\u2019re interested in the debate surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s value, you may be interested in reading more about theories of currency and the switch from the gold standard to fiat currency.\n\nInvestors Look Forward to 2023\n\nAs with any stock, we can\u2019t be 100% certain why Bitcoin\u2019s value increases or decreases, but there are better and worse theories. In 2022, investors thought of several ways Bitcoin stock could experience a rebound. Some of these possibilities included:\n\nLower interest rates: If interest rates started to fall, investors thought it would encourage Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise. That\u2019s because investors would be more willing to invest in riskier assets.\n\nReduced threat of a recession: The danger of an economic downturn loomed large in everyone\u2019s minds in 2022. With economic uncertainty baked into every investor decision, opting for a risky asset like Bitcoin likely didn\u2019t seem feasible.\n\nChanges to the federal regulation: In 2022, the federal government took more interest in regulating the crypto market. Reports were submitted to the President suggesting ways to take advantage of the new technology\u2019s benefits while minimizing risks. Action taken by the federal government could\u2019ve affected the coin\u2019s price.\n\nWider acceptance of crypto: Even in 2023, many potential users are wary of the value of crypto. As more people begin to accept crypto as a way to store and transfer value, Bitcoin\u2019s value will continue to climb.\n\nSome major players in the banking industry foresaw a Bitcoin rebound. Earlier in 2022, Deutsche Bank analysts forecasted that Bitcoin would return to a value of $28,000 by the end of the year. The same bank also predicted that Bitcoin could be the digital gold of the 21st century.\n\nWhy Did Bitcoin\u2019s Value Go Back Up?\n\nNow that the rebound is finally happening, most analysts\u2019 explanations relate to easing macroeconomic conditions. While the Fed has not started lowering rates, they have slowed. Most experts anticipate just one more rate hike in 2023. This is positive news for the stock market generally, but especially for riskier assets like Bitcoin, which seem like more unnecessary expenses when inflation is high and borrowing is expensive.\n\nBanks have also recently experienced heavy losses on different bond holdings. This has contributed to the Federal Reserve being more moderate with rate hikes lately.\n\nCentralized banking has also recently faced some skepticism with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. SVB\u2019s failure was partly caused by the bank\u2019s investments losing value, which triggered depositors to withdraw significant amounts of their money. In the aftermath, some publications argued cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are better suited to running a financial system, which could have contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s rise in price.\n\nOn the other hand, many considered SVB the backbone of the tech start-up world, so its failure led some experts to predict investors would move away from crypto assets. Also, Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank, two of the biggest lenders in the crypto space, recently announced closures. This made the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price somewhat surprising. It suggested recent events did not shake investor confidence so dramatically.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rebound has outpaced growth in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which is only up around 18.5% this quarter. Ethereum and Solana have also seen significant growth so far this year. Where these cryptos will go in the coming months remains to be seen, but with inflation slowly cooling off and interest rates potentially lowering later this year, experts are hopeful.\n\nInvesting In Crypto\n\nAs a speculative and volatile asset, investors should prepare to lose any money they put into cryptocurrency. We\u2019ve seen many crypto crashes in the last few years, and investors shouldn\u2019t take any investment \u2013 especially with crypto \u2013 as a guaranteed success.\n\nHowever, if you are ready to take on some risk, you can earn passive income with your crypto tokens through features like crypto staking, crypto lending, and crypto royalties.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin might be the most well-known cryptocurrency, but it is still subject to the extensive volatility that investors have come to associate with the crypto markets. The economy suffered in 2022, and it hit cryptocurrencies especially hard. Bitcoin lost considerable value from its high at the end of 2021, hitting a trough near the end of 2022. It has since rebounded, probably because of easing macroeconomic conditions and recent troubles in the centralized banking world.\n\nIf you\u2019re an investor building a portfolio of individual cryptocurrencies, keep your eye on current events. Don\u2019t take any investment as a guaranteed success, and learn about ways you can invest smartly and defensively in these ground-breaking new assets.\n\nThe post Why Is Bitcoin Going Back Up? appeared first on Due.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
