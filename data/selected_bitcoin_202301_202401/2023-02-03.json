        "content": "The first steps of a multi-stage plan to regulate the cryptocurrency industry within Australia have been released.\n\nThe Australian government has announced the first step of what it calls a multi-stage approach to tackling cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nAccording to the announcement, \u201cthe multi\u2011stage approach has three elements: strengthening enforcement, bolstering consumer protection; and establishing a framework for reform.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe first step begins with the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) increasing the size of its crypto team and \u201cupping enforcement measures.\u201d These enforcement measures described include taking legal action when cryptocurrencies are marketed without appropriate financial licenses. In addition, the report describes that particular attention will be paid to making sure risks are properly disclosed to consumers.\n\n\n\nThese steps are intended to step up efforts targeting scams, especially those involving cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe Government\u2019s National Anti\u2011Scams Centre, located within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), will facilitate real\u2011time data sharing and the coordinated prevention and disruption of scams,\u201d reads the report, indicating that the collection of data will be a major part of the operations.\n\nIn addition to the steps announced today, the government introduced a token mapping consultation paper addressing \u201cwhich elements of the crypto ecosystem are sufficiently regulated and which require additional attention.\u201d The paper addresses Bitcoin specifically, describing it as a cryptocurrency network with the intent to operate as a \u201cpeer-to-peer payment structure,\u201d as a \u201cnew form of currency.\u201d In addition, the use cases of Bitcoin are illustrated, including its use as a store of value, and as a medium of exchange, \u201cparticularly in emerging markets.\u201d\n\nThe Australian government's multi-stage approach to cryptocurrency regulation is designed to protect consumers while also providing oversight and regulatory clarity, but it remains to be seen if this regulatory environment will stifle growth and innovation, or fulfill its intended purpose while harboring growth.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Read preview\n\nA New Jersey man has admitted he tried to hire a hitman for $20,000 in Bitcoin to kill a 14-year-old boy who was going to testify against him in a child-pornography case, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nJohn Michael Musbach, 31, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, pleaded guilty in federal court to hiring a hitman to carry out a murder, according to a release by the Department of Justice.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nMusbach first encountered the boy in the summer of 2015 when the boy was 13 years old and living in New York with his parents, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The complaint alleges that Musbach and the boy exchanged sexually explicit content with each other online, including videos of themselves masturbating.\n\nThe boy's parents found out and alerted the police, who started investigating Musbach, according to the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors alleged in a court filing that police discovered Musbach had Google searched a variety of alarming queries, like \"child grooming law,\" \"death by chloroform,\" \"where to buy chloroform,\" \"how to buy a gun in NJ,\" and finally, searches on how to erase his search history.\n\nIn March of 2016, authorities arrested Musbach on child pornography charges, prosecutors said in the complaint.\n\nA few months after being arrested, Musbach then \"decided to have the victim killed so that the victim could not testify against him in the pending criminal case,\" the DOJ said in a statement released Thursday. The criminal complaint states that Musbach found a murder-for-hire website on the dark web and arranged to pay $20,000 worth of Bitcoin for the murder of the victim.\n\nThe murder-for-hire service advertised itself on its website, saying \"If you want to kill someone, or to beat the shit out of him, we are the right guys ... No undercover cops here. No risks of getting caught, because we are professional killers,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Musbach asked if 14 years old was too young for the hit, the site administrator said \"14 years old is acceptable,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAfter paying up $20,000 in Bitcoin, Musbach then repeatedly messaged the service asking when the hit would be carried out, prosecutors said.\n\nEventually, the site administrator revealed that the site was a scam and threatened to turn Musbach in to law enforcement if he didn't turn over more money, according to the DOJ.\n\nMusbach allegedly responded, \"is this a joke?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe boy was never harmed, and the site did eventually turn Musbach over to authorities, prosecutors said. Musbach pleaded guilty to the murder-for-hire charges in court on Thursday, according to the DOJ.\n\nMusbach's lawyer, Rocco C. Cipparone, told Insider in a statement, \"Mr. Musbach decided to put this matter behind him without a trial, and accepted his responsibility.\"\n\nMusbach faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced in June."
