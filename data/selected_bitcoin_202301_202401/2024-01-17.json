        "content": "DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Bitcoin does nothing, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.\n\n\"I call it the pet rock,\" he added.\n\nDimon is a long-time bitcoin critic. The bank chief said in 2021 at peak crypto valuations that bitcoin was \"worthless,\" and he doubled down on that sentiment last year in Davos, Switzerland, when he told CNBC that the digital currency was a \"hyped-up fraud.\"\n\nBitcoin is trading just above $42,700, up more than 100% in the past year.\n\n\"This is the last time I'm talking about this with CNBC, so help me God,\" Dimon said. \"Blockchain is real. It's a technology. We use it. It's going to move money, it's going to move data. It's efficient. We've been talking about that for 12 years, too, and it's very small.\"\n\n\"I think we waste too many words on that,\" Dimon added.\n\nThe bank chief went on to distinguish bitcoin from the other class of cryptocurrencies, the ones by which blockchain has enabled the use of smart contracts. Smart contracts are a programmable piece of code written on a public blockchain, such as ethereum , which executes when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary.\n\n\"There's a cryptocurrency which might actually do something,\" Dimon said of smart chain-enriched blockchains. \"You can use it to buy and sell real estate and move data \u2014 tokenizing things that you do something with.\"\n\n\"And then there's one which does nothing,\" Dimon said of bitcoin, though he added that there were real use cases for the virtual coin, which included upward of $100 billion a year caught up in fraud, tax avoidance and sex trafficking. \"I defend your right to do bitcoin,\" Dimon added, saying, \"I don't want to tell you what to do. So my personal advice would be don't get involved. \u2026 But it's a free country.\"\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of more than $830 billion, was cemented as an asset class last week when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the creation of bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nSome of the biggest names in asset management, including BlackRock , Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree, have launched their own spot bitcoin ETFs last week. For the $30 trillion advised wealth management industry, the floodgates could be about to open. Analysts at Standard Chartered anticipate fund inflows in the range of $50 billion to $100 billion in 2024.\n\nWhen asked what he made of Larry Fink changing his view on bitcoin as BlackRock jumped into the spot ETF business, Dimon said, \"I don't care. So just please stop talking about this s***.\"\n\n\"I don't know what he would say about blockchain versus currencies that do something versus bitcoin that does nothing,\" Dimon added. \"But you know this is what makes a market. People have opinions, and this is the last time I'm ever going to state my opinion.\""

        "content": "Print this page\n\nUS asset managers are vying to launch exchange traded funds with leveraged bitcoin exposure and expand into bitcoin-based options and other cryptocurrencies after last week\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nProShares this week disclosed plans to launch five ETFs, including one that would offer twice the daily exposure to a bitcoin-tracking index and others to provide inverse bitcoin returns, paying out up to double any decline in an underlying index, according to filings with the SEC. The extra leverage in the ETFs \u2014 which are not designed to be long-term investments \u2014 would amplify swings experienced by the already volatile bitcoin price.\n\nProShares, which declined to comment on the filings, is working in the newly unencumbered part of the market alongside firms such as Grayscale Investments, which last week filed to launch a product that will sell options on its $26bn bitcoin ETF. So are asset managers including BlackRock, which is looking to widen its massive ETF line-up to include exposure to other cryptocurrencies \u2014 foreshadowing future clashes with wary regulators.\n\n\u201cI see value in having an ethereum ETF,\u201d BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink told CNBC last week. Ethereum is a widely used blockchain with its own cryptocurrency (ether, or ETH, the second-largest token behind bitcoin). The SEC in October allowed a number of ether futures ETFs to launch.\n\nAny such strategy will need to pass muster with the SEC, which approved spot bitcoin ETFs after years of reluctance and with serious reservations.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler cautioned in his statement about the spot bitcoin ETF approvals that they did not \u201csignal anything about the commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws\u201d.\n\nEther ETFs were likely to face \u201csignificant hurdles to overcome, but if the SEC denies it, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the end of the story,\u201d Chris Brodersen, a managing director specialising in blockchain and digital assets at accounting firm EisnerAmper. \u201cI think these companies will do exactly what they did with bitcoin, which is go back and look for more clarity if necessary or look to the courts for some relief and try again.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s loss in a legal battle with Grayscale last year is widely seen as a turning point away from nearly a decade of denial, allowing bitcoin ETFs to pull in nearly $900mn in their first three days of trading earlier this month despite more than $1bn of outflows from Grayscale\u2019s ETF.\n\nVarious US issuers have previously secured approval for double-leveraged and inverse ETFs. Covered call ETFs, which sell options on underlying holdings to generate income, have boomed in popularity in recent years.\n\nJoe Hall, an attorney at Davis Polk, which advised Grayscale on its recent bitcoin ETF conversion, described the proposed leveraged and options-based bitcoin strategies as natural extensions.\n\n\u201cHow long that takes, I couldn\u2019t tell you, but if there\u2019s already analogues in ETF land or financial derivatives on the basic product, I suspect that those all end up being approved one way or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a very different question once you get outside of bitcoin.\u201d"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nBitcoin exchange traded funds have pulled in just under $900mn in the first three days of trading, as investors cautiously welcome the new stock market vehicles that track the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe new funds, which include those from BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Invesco, have had net inflows of $871mn, according to data from CoinShares, a digital asset manager.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, led the way with $723mn of inflows, followed by Fidelity with $545mn. The inflows were offset by $1.18bn of outflows at Grayscale, which converted its existing $28bn bitcoin fund into an ETF alongside the new launches.\n\nAnalysts believe the bulk of the outflows is likely to be investors moving to one of the new funds, which all charge lower fees than Grayscale. Excluding the outflows at Grayscale, the 10 new ETFs have drawn in just over $2bn.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts celebrated the approval of the funds by the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week after more than a decade of rejections. Supporters hope it will attract new investors to the token and boost its price in the long term.\n\nGrowing speculation that the SEC would approve so-called spot bitcoin ETFs had pushed the price of bitcoin up more than 70 per cent since October. However, bitcoin has fallen roughly 6 per cent since their approval.\n\n\u201cBy no means was this launch a mass success,\u201d said Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s latest price action shows that this has so far been an underwhelming launch for products that were so highly anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe funds\u2019 collective performance also fell short of the $1bn that ProShares pulled in on its first two days after launching a bitcoin futures ETF in October 2021.\n\nGrayscale, which has run a bitcoin trust since 2013, helped open the door to regulatory approval for bitcoin ETFs after winning a court victory against the SEC last year. But analysts said its conversion last week offered investors an opportunity to exit their holdings.\n\nPreviously, investors had been able to sell their holdings only in the over-the-counter market, and they often traded at a large discount to the price of bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shuffling around of deck chairs . . . because Grayscale was trading as a closed-end fund for so long, but as soon as it became an ETF it became liquid, so it\u2019s not surprising to see selling pressure coming from Grayscale,\u201d said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.\n\nAnalysts also pointed out that Grayscale charged a 1.5 per cent fee, which is more than a percentage point higher than new market entrants.\n\n\u201cFollowing a sharp run-up in valuations, it\u2019s natural to see some profit-taking from the investment community,\u201d said Zach Pandl, Grayscale\u2019s managing director for research.\n\nSome brokers have declined to offer trading in the new bitcoin ETFs. Vanguard, the world\u2019s second-largest asset manager, said the new products \u201cdid not align with its offer of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio\u201d.\n\nAnalysts said flows into bitcoin ETFs would take time to materialise as advisers became comfortable enough with the products to recommend them as additions to client portfolios.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about day one. This is new for a lot of clients,\u201d said an executive at one of the issuers who declined to be identified. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to have a full education and understand its role in a portfolio and ultimately choose to make an allocation to a product. What I\u2019m most excited about is the long-term prospects. We are giving access to an entirely new market.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting from Steve Johnson in London"
