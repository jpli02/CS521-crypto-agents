        "title": "Crypto has \u2018lost its shine\u2019 for institutional investors, says Northern Trust executive - CNBC",
        "content": "Institutional investors lost interest in crypto after 2022 and even with this year's uptrend, their appetite for it hasn't come back yet, according to Northern Trust's head of digital assets and financial markets.\n\nJustin Chapman told CNBC's \"Crypto World\" at the Digital Assets Week conference in San Francisco that institutions have shifted their focus to cryptocurrencies' underlying blockchain technology, but that his firm \"has capabilities\" in place should client interest in crypto assets rebound.\n\n\"Just after March the crypto market went off a cliff\u2026 the client interest has definitely gone off the same cliff in terms of institutional interest in in cryptocurrencies,\" he said.\n\n\"It's definitely quiet now, since 2022, from the institutional side,\" he continued. \"Before that, we were seeing traditional fund managers looking to launch crypto funds, ETPs in Europe, which is the equivalent of ETFs in the U.S. \u2014 that's really gone quiet. Even the hedge funds, who are pretty active in the markets, have certainly reduced their exposure within that particular space.\"\n\nMeanwhile, leaders from the biggest financial institutions gathered at the San Francisco conference were energized when it came to the blockchain technology \u2013 specifically its potential to help tokenize real-world assets like gold for clients.\n\nThe \"evolution of the technology\" is moving into a \"better place\" in terms of support from market participants, Chapman said.\n\n\"As a firm, we have capabilities that sit there to administer [crypto trading] functions, but it's a pretty quiet market at the moment and [after] most of the issues we had last year, we haven't seen a rebound at all on the institutional side yet,\" he said.\n\nSpecifically, Northern Trust partnered with Standard Chartered in 2020 to launch Zodia, a crypto custodian for institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin has gained almost 75% this year after losing 64% in 2022. Trading was still to begin the year, with volatility falling to historic lows. The regulatory crackdown in the U.S. been a dark cloud over the industry while the banking crisis has helped push bitcoin's price higher. Both have brought volatility back to the market. Even as bitcoin currently struggles to break above the $30,000 level, investors agree it remains in a long-term uptrend.\n\n\"We're not focused that much on the asset class because the client isn't at the moment,\" Chapman said. \"So we're not seeing that appetite to have that within their portfolios. If that changes, as a firm, we can account for those capabilities. But it's certainly lost its shine from the institutional perspective.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin's Frenzy of Activity Pushes Average Transaction Fee Over $7, Nearly 2-Year High - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A spike in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain involving Ethereum-style tokens and non-fungible token (NFT)-like \u201cinscriptions\u201d has driven up congestion on the network, pushing the average fee rate to the highest in nearly two years while showering miners of the cryptocurrency with extra revenue.\n\nOn Wednesday, the average fee per Bitcoin transaction rose to $7.25, the highest since July 2021. For comparison, the rate so far this year had fluctuated between roughly 50 cents and $4, data from BitInfoCharts shows.\n\nWith transaction activity also surging, total fees on Bitcoin have also jumped.\n\nPer blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin\u2019s total transaction fees, which are paid by users to miners, jumped to around 124 BTC or roughly $3.5 million, on May 3, representing a 484% increase in the past 14 days.\n\n\u201cThis current fee spree is an anomaly,\u201d wrote Colin Harper, head of content at Luxor Technologies, a full-stack Bitcoin mining pool.\n\nBitcoin: Total Transaction Fees (Glassnode)\n\nIn recent days, a token type called BRC-20 (a play on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard), which facilitates the issue and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, has accounted for about 6% of all Bitcoin activity since its inception in early March, according to pseudonymous analyst and yield farmer Dynamo DeFi. This year has also seen the rise of Ordinals inscriptions, which are similar to NFTs and could be images or text strings inscribed into Bitcoin-based transactions. Both activities require transaction fees.\n\n\u201cInscriptions are the primary driver here,\u201d said Harper. \u201cBiggest difference now between this jump in transaction fees and past ones with inscriptions is that BRC-20 standard is a new way to inscribe. Adoption of this standard is driving fees up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe increase in transaction volume of that token standard has driven up demand for Bitcoin blockspace,\u201d said Jimmy Zhang, who works in the business operations and strategy department at blockchain data firm Artemis.\n\nKydo, vice president of Stanford Blockchain Club, told CoinDesk via direct messages on Telegram that \"Blockspace is the core commodity on any blockchain. People have found a new use case and the usage skyrocketed. BTC is more than money now.\" Kydo said they only use the one name publicly because of privacy concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiners who secure and maintain the Bitcoin network are beneficiaries of the recent increase in BTC transaction fees because they are rewarded in BTC fees for processing users\u2019 transactions.\n\nHarper predicts the increased transaction fees currently occurring in the ecosystem are \u201ca temporary phenomenon, though, and that transaction fees will revert back to a manageable mean soon.\u201d\n\nKydo said they think the current phenomenon will last a while, \"given how much people like NFTs.\"\n\nThe price of BTC has increased 1.2% in the past 24 hours to $28,884, at press time. The average transaction fee on Bitcoin is $7.25. According to data website cryptofees.info, Bitcoin\u2019s seven-day average fee stands at roughly $2 million, second only behind Ethereum\u2019s $12.5 million. BNB Smart Chain is next with about $575,000."

        "content": "In Silicon Valley, Tim Draper is venture capital royalty. A third-generation investor, Draper was an early backer of some of the most pivotal technology to come out of California, from Hotmail to Skype. In recent years, his focus has been on Bitcoin and the broader ethos of decentralization, famously paying $19 million for 30,000 Bitcoin in 2014 that had been seized in the U.S. government takedown of dark web marketplace Silk Road.\n\nMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home\n\nWhile some of his bets have not paid off\u2014including an investment in Theranos and repeated predictions that Bitcoin would reach $250,000\u2014he is continuing to throw his chips in with the pioneer cryptocurrency. In an interview with Fortune, Draper said he expects Bitcoin to soar in value amid economic uncertainty in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf the bear gets that angry to where the banks start falling apart, that actually means that Bitcoin will have a bull market,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a raging bull in the middle of the bear.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is currently sitting at just under $29,000. It\u2019s up nearly 75% since the beginning of 2023 amid the failures of major U.S. banks Signature, Silicon Valley Bank, and First Republic.\n\nDraper\u2019s support of Bitcoin does not extend to the entire crypto ecosystem. While he backed pioneering projects like the blockchain Tezos, he said he\u2019s wary of companies that are too centralized. Draper said he twice turned down an investment opportunity in Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s now-failed exchange FTX, arguing that there was no utility for its proprietary token, FTT, except for speculation.\n\nAs FTX rose in popularity in 2021 and 2022, Draper said he thought he had missed something, but was vindicated in November when the company collapsed in spectacular fashion.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI just thought it was a race to the bottom,\u201d Draper said about CeFi, or centralized finance, companies like FTX.\n\nHis concern now is with crypto regulation, as lawmakers debate legislation to establish guardrails for the industry and agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission target firms with enforcement actions. Draper said that when he speaks with startups in the space, they ask him about regulation, which had never before been the case.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re regulating by enforcement, they\u2019re just slapping people down and fining them and suing them,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste years of my life in court and trying to avoid some problem.\u201d\n\nDraper, who has advocated for breaking up California into six states, said that the only solution is to have a new political party in charge.\n\n\u201cThis is as controlling as the U.S. government has ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining business, they\u2019re killing the golden goose, and Silicon Valley is breaking up because of it.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 best Bitcoin stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. To skip the detailed analysis and recent updates about the cryptocurrency industry, go directly to the 5 Best Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds.\n\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 and since then it has had the most volatile movements among all asset classes. If we look at Bitcoin\u2019s price history, its shows some interesting trends. In 2010, Bitcoin was worth $0.9 and reached $26.9 in 2011. Over the years, it showed high volatility. In May 2017, Bitcoin was worth $2000 and reached over $19,000 in December of the same year.\n\nDuring these ups and downs, the brightest year for Bitcoin was noted in 2021 as we reported previously that the cryptocurrency had reached its peak at $69,000. Later in 2022, cryptocurrency experienced one of its biggest disasters known as the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d mainly due to the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX\u2019s scandal, combined with Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes due to rising inflation. It was estimated that Bitcoin would close out in 2022 at $16,800. The cryptocurrency traded at even less than the estimated amount at around $16,530 on December 31, 2022.\n\nThe FTX scandal was revealed when the digital currency news website, CoinDesk published an article stating that the FTX\u2019s sister firm Alameda Research\u2019s balance sheet was full of FTT tokens. It was later found that the capital provided by FTX to Alameda Research were customer deposits. This led Binance to sell all of its FTT tokens leading to a crash in its price which would later lead to a plethora of withdrawals from the exchange, creating a severe shortage of liquidity in the firm, thus leading to its bankruptcy.\n\nFTX\u2019s CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was later arrested and his bail bond was set at $250 million which is the largest one in history. The FTX collapse spread shockwaves among the industry and shepherded two major banks toward their collapse and a third one barely getting by and is currently being investigated by the US Department of Justice for accounts connected to Bankman-Fried's businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nCryptocurrency Outlook\n\nDespite facing a rough year in 2022, Bitcoin made a major comeback as it is up by 86.86% at the time of writing from its November lows and trading at $29,444, marking its highest price since June 2022. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest predicted that the cryptocurrency\u2019s price may reach $1 million in 2023. The director of institutional sales at Paradigm believes that this is just the beginning of the rally for Bitcoin. He wrote:\n\n\"Now we've seen rates start to fall sharply, with the market pricing in rate cuts in the second half of the year. The Fed and ECB balance sheets are also back in expansion mode. This is the bullish thesis but on steroids.\" In addition, Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, said about cryptocurrencies:\n\n\"2023 will be a transition year from the vicious, frigid crypto winter of 2022 into something hopefully a lot hotter in 2024.\"\n\nMoreover, cryptocurrency stocks have also rallied significantly as cryptocurrency exchange platform, Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has been up by around 60% year to date as of April 30, and cryptocurrency mining company Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) is up over 250% year to date. During this crypto rally, we have curated this list of best Bitcoin stocks to invest in according to hedge funds that include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL).\n\n10 Best Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we chose the companies based on their hedge fund sentiment. The companies on the list are directly or indirectly involved in Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin trading, and broader crypto trading.\n\nThe hedge fund sentiment around each stock has been taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 943 elite hedge funds.\n\nBest Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds\n\n10. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nInteractive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) is a brokerage company dealing in cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, bonds, futures, and more. The firm started cryptocurrency trading in September 2021, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin, and Bitcoin cash.\n\nOn February 15, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) announced, in partnership with OSL Digital Securities, the launch of cryptocurrency trading in Hong Kong for clients who have investable assets worth $1 million and institutions who have $5 million and more.\n\nThe hedge sentiment was positive toward Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in Q4 with 42 hedge funds holding a stake, compared to 35 funds in Q3. After increasing its investment in the company by 18%, Bermuda-based Orbis Investment Management is the biggest shareholder with 4.2 million shares.\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are some of the prominent Bitcoin stocks on our list in addition to Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR).\n\nLVS Advisory mentioned Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what is said:\n\n\u201cThe most notable new position this year has been our investment in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR). I published a detailed write-up (link here) and also appeared on the \u2018Yet Another Value Podcast\u2019 (link here) to discuss our IBKR thesis. To boil it down, IBKR benefits from higher interest rates, and the stock was available at an exceptionally cheap price. I believe IBKR represents a particularly good risk/reward bet and have made it our largest position.\u201d\n\n9. CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nCME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is the leader of the financial derivatives market globally as it owns and operates multiple exchanges. Involved in the trading of cryptocurrencies futures, stock indexes, interest rates, and more, the group is one of the best Bitcoin stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nCME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is a dividend-paying stock that has increased its dividend for the last 13 years. At the time of writing, the company has a dividend yield of 2.37%. The company\u2019s latest dividend increase was recorded in February when it increased the quarterly dividend to $1.10 from $1.00.\n\nOn April 17, CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) announced the addition of new options to the range of standard and micro-sized Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) contracts with extended expiries.\n\nVGI Partners Global Investments Limited talked about CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) in its 2022 annual investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cCME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is a business likely familiar to you, being one we have owned in our global strategy since 2008 and which was our largest VG1 position at the end of 2022. CME operates futures and derivatives exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Dow Jones Index Services. On top of this, CME also owns other key assets related to foreign exchange trading & infrastructure and a strategic shareholding in Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) Index business. The key driver of trading activity for CME is in its interest rate derivatives products, where it has an effective monopoly in the exchange trading of interest rate derivatives in the United States, with benchmark products across the entirety of the interest rate curve. Demand for interest rate derivatives is driven by volatility in interest rate markets, whose effect is compounded by the number of bonds held by those looking to manage interest rate risk and, by extension, market liquidity. The below chart of average daily volumes of interest rate derivatives and US Federal debt held by the public illustrates the extremely strong relationship the size of the US Treasury market and volumes growth, although there are deviations around this primarily around Fed intervention (for example, at the start of the pandemic, volumes were suppressed by an enormous amount of Quantitative Easing (QE) and effectively zero interest rates which reduced the demand for hedging products). We expect the growth in the size of the US Treasury market, particularly in relation to privately held US treasuries as the Fed undergoes a balance sheet unwind, to remain a powerful underpinning of CME\u2019s interest rate derivatives business\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 70\n\nProviding its services in multiple countries, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a tech conglomerate with multiple products and services under its belt, including financial services and digital payment platforms. The latest step to penetrate the international crypto market taken by the company was in the form of partnering with Yellow Card. Through the partnership, Block\u2019s TBD will be used to send cross-border payments to any of the 16 African countries where Yellow Card operates.\n\nOn April 25, Credit Suisse lowered the price target of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)\u2019s shares from $105 to $100 while maintaining an Outperform rating. According to the firm, the company\u2019s gross profit estimates will be a little lower but the business model is set to experience any \u201cdisclosure and more conservative GPV growth in the second half of 2023\u201d.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, 70 hedge funds held a stake in Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) worth $4.255 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. ARK Investment Management was the biggest shareholder with a little over 9 million shares in Q4 2022.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cBlock, Inc. provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block\u2019s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.\u201d\n\n7. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is headquartered in New York and is one of the most prominent financial services companies. Along with offering card products, it is the biggest issuer of travelers\u2019 cheques globally. The company got involved in Bitcoin when it announced to launch a crypto card in collaboration with Abra, a fintech company.\n\nOn April 20, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) reported an EPS of $2.40 and revenue of $14.28 billion in Q1 2023, beating expectations by $260 million. The 21.7% YoY growth was a result of card members spending more during the quarter and increased interest income with elevated average loan volumes.\n\nOn March 8, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) announced a 15% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share. The other announcement was the commencement of a share repurchase program of nearly 120 million common shares.\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leader in the automotive and clean energy industry. The company earned $64 million on Bitcoin in 2022 because of its trading activities and currently owns $184 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey\u2019s database, the company has seen positive sentiment in Q4 2022 compared to the previous quarter as the number of hedge funds holding a stake in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) increased to 91 in Q4 from 88 in Q3. Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group was the most significant stakeholder as it increased its holding in the company by 179% to 7.5 million worth $926.2 million.\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was mentioned in the first-quarter 2023 investor letter of Aristotle Atlantic Partners. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a negative contributor to performance due to our underweight position relative to Russell 1000 Growth Index, as the company had strong performance in Q1. The strength occurred after the company partially reversed a previously announced price cut for its electric vehicles following a period of strong demand. Tesla also reported better-than-expected results for Q4 2022 during the first quarter. Tesla Motors designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-performance, technologically advanced electric cars and solar energy generation and energy storage products. Tesla sells more than five fully electric cars, among others, the Model X and Y SUVs, as well as the Model S sedan and Model 3 sedan. The company has a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers, typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla owners quick and reliable charging. Tesla offers certain advanced driver assist systems under its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving options. US customers generate nearly half of Tesla\u2019s sales. We see Tesla as the leading manufacturer of battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). The company has achieved scaled production of EVs before the other large automobile manufacturers. The company\u2019s technology in battery production and self-driving technology is more mature than competitors\u2019 offerings. EVs are one of the fastest growing categories within automobile manufacturing. The profit margin in the automotive segment is significantly above automotive competitors which provides the company flexibility to price its vehicles more strategically as the competition eventually scales up their EV production. The direct-to-consumer sales model gives the company more control over its relationship with its customers as well as a source of higher profit margin since there is no dealership share of the profits.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nDisclosure.
