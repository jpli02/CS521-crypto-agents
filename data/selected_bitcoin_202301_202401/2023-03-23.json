        "content": "FILE PHOTO: A representation of bitcoin is seen in an illustration picture\n\nBy Evan Garcia and Dan Fastenberg\n\nMCCAMEY, Texas (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency bankruptcies and worries over electric power consumption have failed to dent the industry's growth in Texas, according to a top trade group, citing the rise in the miners' power demands.\n\nBitcoin miners consume about 2,100 megawatts of the state's power supplies, said Lee Bratcher, president of industry group Texas Blockchain Council. That power usage rose 75% last year and was nearly triple that of the prior 12 months, Bratcher said.\n\nThose demands amount to about 3.7% of the state's lowest forecast peak load this year, according to data from grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).\n\n\"There's been some challenges with the Bitcoin mining industry,\" Bratcher said, noting his group recently saw two prominent bankruptcies and other miners scaling back expansions.\n\nThe industry also faces new federal regulations, including a proposed 30% tax on electricity usage for digital mining and calls by the U.S. Treasury secretary and commodities regulator for a regulatory framework.\n\nNew York this year imposed a ban on some cryptocurrency mining that runs on fossil fuel-generated power. Other states are expected to follow suit.\n\nBut in Texas, some counties have offered tax incentives and miners continue to be drawn to its wind and solar power, which could supply about 39% of ERCOT's energy needs in 2023.\n\n\"Bitcoin mining is a very energy intensive business, which is why we tend to find places like West Texas to be full of Bitcoin miners,\" said Matt Prusak, chief commercial officer at cryptocurrency miner U.S. Bitcoin Corp, which has one of its mining operations in a 280-megawatt wind farm in Texas.\n\nIts McCamey, Texas, site last month consumed 173,000 megawatt hours of power \u2013 about 60% provided by the grid and nearly 40% from the nearby wind farm. The average American home uses about 10 MWh in a year, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Texas, where about 250 people died during a winter storm blackout that exposed the fragility of the state's grid, the prospect of higher crypto demand has raised alarms.\n\n\"There are a lot of Bitcoin mines that are trying to connect to the system,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. \"If all of them were to connect in the timelines that they are looking to connect, then it probably would present an issue to the grid because that load would be growing way faster than it ever has before.\"\n\n(Reporting by Evan Garcia and Dan Fastenberg; writing by Laila Kearney; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

        "content": "Private Key for Wallet with $1.5M in Bitcoin will be Affixed to Lunar Outpost's MAPP Lunar Rover; Can Only Be Accessed via Space Travel\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif., March 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Social Intelligence company LunarCrush is sending a treasure chest of 62 Bitcoin (currently worth ~$1.5M) to the Earth's moon. The Bitcoin bounty, dubbed Nakamoto_1 , will be unlocked by the first space traveler to reach the moon and obtain the wallet's private key, which will be etched onto a Lunar Outpost MAPP Rover launching into space later this year.\n\nSocial Intelligence company LunarCrush is sending a treasure chest of Bitcoin to the Earth\u2019s moon. The Bitcoin bounty, dubbed Nakamoto_1, will be unlocked by the first space traveler to reach the moon and obtain the wallet\u2019s private key, which will be etched onto a Lunar Outpost MAPP Rover launching into space later this year.\n\nLunarCrush teamed up with global leader in commercial planetary mobility Lunar Outpost , to send this lunar treasure chest to the moon. Animation studio Golden Wolf , and Bitcoin developer tools company Hiro partnered with LunarCrush to make Nakamoto_1 come to life. The technology and design partners created and will sell an NFT collection to raise funds for the Bitcoin bounty. The goal of this Web3-powered space race is to inspire the next generation of interplanetary exploration.\n\n\"When you put out a seemingly unachievable goal, the innovation that happens can be incredible. Our goal is to inspire people to build communities that will unlock a new era of exploration,\" said Joe Vezzani, CEO of LunarCrush. \"We envision classrooms, groups, companies, and even DAOs coming together to reach the Moon and split the treasure chest's rewards. It's like Willy Wonka's 'golden ticket' for the Web3 era, and we couldn't be more excited to see how it all unfolds.\"\n\nThe process of engraving the private key affixed to the rover will be fully documented, providing transparency and ensuring that no one, including the contributing teams, has access to the private keys. Once Lunar Outpost's MAPP Rover lands on the moon, anyone on Earth can create a plan to reach it and unlock the bounty of digital gold. The rover will be taken to the moon in Q4 of this year via a SpaceX rocket, but for security reasons the exact date has not yet been disclosed.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"What may sound outlandish to some will open new frontiers that haven't been explored outside the mind in a long time. Future generations will look to us as pioneers of interplanetary exploration and adventure,\" said Dr. Forrest Meyen, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Lunar Outpost. \"As the Google Lunar XPRIZE kickstarted the commercial lunar rover industry, we view Nakamoto_1 as an opportunity to inspire the next generation to overcome challenges in space travel and exploration. LunarCrush is using modern blockchain technology to deliver a treasure instead of organizing a prize committee. This structure incentivizes exploration while unlocking the best of human ingenuity. Lunar Outpost is proud to provide our first-in-history commercial lunar surface transportation to innovative projects like Nakamoto_1.\n\nTo fund the Bitcoin bounty, LunarCrush will sell a special collection of Bitcoin-secured NFTs starting March 28th at lunarcrush.com/nakamoto1. Twenty-five percent of sales of the NFTs will go towards funding the treasure chest and twenty-five percent of sales will go to funding a \"Community Marketing Wallet,\" which will go toward funding Bitcoin core development and STEM education related causes. The NFTs will be priced at $250 USD. Secondary NFT sales on the Gamma.io marketplace, along with any contributions to the public wallet, will further increase the value of the treasure chest sent to the Moon. In addition, the teams will inscribe some of the NFT concept art as Ordinals and will include them in the treasure chest.\n\nGolden Wolf, an award-winning creative studio known for design and animation, was contracted to create stunning NFTs and imagery that range from static images to heavily animated collectables that help set the tone for the project.\n\n\"We loved the idea that the art could inspire a new generation of young people to look to the stars, like a contemporary version of an Apollo 11 poster on a bedroom wall,\" said Ingi Erlingsson, Founder and CEO of Golden Wolf. \"We wanted the aesthetic to feel modern and unique, with a hint of vintage sci-fi art.\"\n\nBitcoin was selected as the currency of choice for the treasure chest because it's the most long-lasting, secure, and future-proof form of money. Hiro provided technical support for the creation of the Bitcoin-backed NFTs that will fund the treasure chest.\n\n\"We're excited to inspire a new generation of space explorers as they make that next small step for the world,\" said Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro.\n\nTo learn more about Nakamoto_1, please visit: lunarcrush.com/nakamoto1\n\nABOUT LUNARCRUSH\n\nThere's more to markets than just trading off of price.
