        "title": "Binance coin loses $6 billion in market cap, bitcoin holders hopeful on $30,000 by end of March - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Yahoo Finance crypto reporter David Hollerith joins the Live show with updates on Binance and bitcoin.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\n- Investors piling out of Binance Coin, with more than $6 billion of outflows over the past month. David Hollerith here to discuss what is happening here, my man.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Dave, so two weeks ago, the US-based crypto trust company Paxos, which creates an issues the Binance USD stablecoin, the stablecoin you're talking about, was ordered to stop creating new versions of the token by New York regulators. And since then, we've seen about $6 billion fall from the market cap of this coin. A little more than half of that total has flowed into two larger stablecoins, Tether and Circle's USDC. So prior to the regulatory crackdown, Binance USD was the third largest stablecoin. But this is the beginning of-- excuse me, not the beginning, this is the latest of what's been a series of kerfuffles and financial questions that have been thrown towards Binance in the wake of FTX's collapse.\n\nThere's also been this \"Forbes\" article that came out on Monday that drew attention to the fact that Binance may be moving assets in-- or, excuse me, the assets that support stablecoins linked to this stablecoin, which are also known as B tokens. They've been moving those outside of the exchange's wallets and to other parties, including trading firms, which also include Alameda Research. So there's a lot of questions about that transaction flow and what it could mean for customers' assets.\n\nAnd Binance has rebuked a lot of these charges. Their statements have been mixed. But more or less, they've said that the report has been a misunderstanding of blockchain data.\n\nNow, while it remains to be seen what is correct, the CSO of Binance or shortly after Paxos experienced this crackdown had said that regardless of how the exchange keeps cryptocurrency in wallets, it keeps a separate ledger for corporate transactions, for corporate money and customer money. But it's really not been made clear whether or not that's actually being divided in practice in how they keep the money in wallets. And if what Forbes is alleging is true in backing, I will say, with blockchain data, it would seem that at least for a period in late August, Binance did move funds that were supposed to back one of its-- a few of its stablecoins to trading firms, which would mean the company was lending and not necessarily backing its assets one for one, as they have said they've been doing. But, again, this is all something that we're going to continue to watch as it unfolds.\n\nStory continues\n\n- We certainly will. And, David, while we have you, Bitcoin. Let's talk about the price that we have seen, the rally that we have seen since the start of the year. You're looking at Bitcoin up just over 40% since January 1.\n\nWhat do you make of this massive rally that we've seen? And we're starting a new month today, the first day of March. Enough for that momentum to continue?\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, January was momentum fueled for cryptocurrencies. And through February, we actually saw the rally fizzle out. Cryptocurrencies in general ended yesterday, the end of February, flat. And while volatility has fizzled, traders are still piling into the crypto options market.\n\nAnd they have concentrated bets, according to the data, from platform Amber Data of Bitcoin hitting $30,000. And that's the highest concentration, although there's a lot of bets that have been placed between $25,000 and $30,000. And $25,000, of course, is the price that traders have been looking for Bitcoin to rally past. It did breach that price point in February briefly. But that's been the point of contention here.\n\nAnd the expiration date for options right now, the highest amount is set for March 31. So unless the price goes higher before then, we could expect a large liquidation. But, that being said, it looks like because there's little resistance in between $25,000 and $30,000, if the price does get a momentum rally this month above $26,000 or something like that, we could very easily see $30,000.\n\n- All right, David Hollerith, always great to have you there. It's certainly been incredible watching the price action as of late when it comes to crypto and Bitcoin more specifically."

        "title": "Crypto winter far from over, may once again be testing lower prices if not lower bottoms: Ajeet Khurana - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit IIM Kozhikode IIMK Chief Product Officer Programme Visit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAccording to me, the crypto winter is far from being over. We should once again be testing lower prices if not lower bottoms. We have seen some relief because money came into the market in hopes that there will be no further interest rate hikes. Also, the FTX crisis and before that the Luna crisis has now started getting forgotten and in the absence of any more new fraudulent activity coming up, people are feeling confident again,\u201d says, Founder,Crypto prices are determined by three things -- one, which has nothing to do with crypto which is macroeconomics. US interest rates are 19 times higher than they were one year ago so 0.25 to 4.75, this has been the biggest driver of the crash but this has also been the driver of some relief we saw recently. The other two problems are very crypto centric. One is there are a lot of protocols and tokens that came out in the market and could only survive in the bull market. One by one they are crashing and then, of course, the ever persistent scams and frauds that may come up. This is the buzz in the crypto market.It would require me to have astrological ability to answer that with precision. In the absence of that I will give you my guess with a disclaimer that I am not a financial advisor. According to me, the crypto winter is far from being over. We should once again be testing lower prices if not lower bottoms. We have seen some relief because money came into the market in hopes that there will be no further interest rate hikes. Also, the FTX crisis and before that the Luna crisis has now started getting forgotten and in the absence of any more new fraudulent activity coming up, people are feeling confident again.Unlike the stock market which has such a long track record, in crypto we have had only four bull markets so far. So, we do not have too much of a track record. What we have seen is that in all cases, when the bear market ended, it was preceded by much more than one year of sideways movement of prices.In the previous bear market, the sideways movement was around the $10,000 mark. This time it is around the $20,000 mark. So even if we are looking at new players coming in or we are looking at money coming into the market. There are lots of people just waiting to sell at even slightly improved prices. So, prices going up is very unlikely in the near future or substantially up. There are some reasons why it might go down. I am clenching my teeth and even preparing for Q1 25 kind of revival though I suspect it will happen much earlier, maybe in early 24.One very interesting statistic which your viewers may not know is that only Bitcoin and Ethereum are two tokens which have survived more than one bull market and that is very interesting. That means when the bear market comes, the previous heroes do not remain heroes anymore. This time, barring Luna and FTT, that is a FTX token called FTT, we have not seen the demise of any major tokens and that worries me. Some of them might be coming up especially because crypto projects actually use their own tokens as if it is a currency and when the value of these tokens and currencies go down, their ability to buy and perform operations go down. Currently they are only firing people. We have not seen worse action than that. My worry is if some of that happens, prices could go down further.If you are looking at a global level, roughly 1% of the people who participate in all asset markets, real estate, forex, equity, mutual funds, etc, participate in crypto markets. The fact is that sentiment of this 1% is very different from the sentiment of the remaining 99% who have not yet come in. The remaining 99% still remain sceptical. They are not even sure that Bitcoin would not go down to zero for instance, but that is not the sentiment of people within the crypto markets. They are trying to be selective and look for companies that may have some more survival, some are going for the major tokens which is Bitcoin and Ethereum. The sentiment amongst crypto investors is pretty decent. Non-crypto investors are staying away.I always have buy orders at various prices and based on the percentage, not on amounts. I have bought all the way down to 15,700 on Bitcoin and my highest purchase has been around the 21,500 marks which was on the way down, not on the way up, which is very important. At present, I fear that all my buy orders which are much lower than present prices may not get fulfilled.Yesterday, one of the Emirates in the United Arab Emirates called Ras Al Khaimah actually opened a crypto free zone. In the last one week, Hong Kong has announced favourable crypto regulations. What we are finding is that there are several pockets around the world where more and more favourable regulations are happening. Even in the US, in the state of Wyoming, in the last one year, we have seen some very positive regulation.On the India front, while they may not officially agree to it, I always sense that there is a difference of opinion between the Reserve Bank of India and the Finance Ministry. Even in the G20, the Finance Minister continued her repeated mention that she would work with international collaboration while the Reserve Bank of India governor actually talked about the fact that we should consider a ban. Since the next discussion in G20 is only in October, it is fair to say that we have a little break and a respite of at least the next 10 months before this topic of ban comes up again.Let us consider two scenarios; one, eventually the whole world will ban crypto, in which case India will look like a visionary. I think the world is headed in the opposite direction and that is regulation. If that happens, given India's tech talent, given India's English speaking population and young population, I fear we are going to miss the bus.I fear that like we have done in the internet, e-commerce and social media, where we had to play catch up and by the way, we caught up pretty well, even here we are going to be condemned to do that. So I would require some visionary thinking from the central bank and finance ministry, recognize the direction in which the winds are blowing globally and align India to maximize its benefit from that.Regrettably, yes, and scams arise for three reasons; one is people come up with fraudulent activity as they literally are fly-by-night operators. If regulations come in, that should reduce.The second one is technological failures such as the one we saw in Luna. Now in this situation, we are just too early, pretty much like when debit cards came here. Debit cards had all the time. Despite more debit cards today, we are seeing that less. I think that is the industry that we are going up.The third one is that today the people who are in the crypto industry and I am talking of the likes of exchanges as well as other start-ups, are focused fundamentally on customer acquisition and not customer education. As a result, the customers, even the ones who are making profits are actually doing it by ignorance. When the audience is ignorant, there will be people who will prey upon that ignorance.If you look at India versus the rest of the world, we have a distinction. In India, the conservative financial investor is largely staying away from crypto markets. The people who invest in mutual funds, the people who have been investing in the stock market for decades, most of them have not touched crypto. It is the people who are in the 18-32 age group that accounts for 85% of crypto investors. Now, these people are investing despite hearing once every two or three months from the RBI that there should be a ban. So that means these people are the wild risk takers. So if a policy comes in, we bring in a new breed of larger relatively more conservative investors. At that point of time, we should see a reduction in the sort of speculative activity you see and hence a reduction in scams.There are two different categories although it sounded like one. The ones who have made severe losses are not necessarily the ones who have lost all hope. So here is the thing. Pretty much like any asset class, just because you may have lost 50%, 80% does not mean that you will have to hold it because it has to go up. Though it can go up, that does not mean it will not go down first.Second, those who are considering swapping between one token and another, may have a very interesting strategy. Please move to bigger, larger cap, more established tokens. The really bad tokens that some of us may have purchased hoping to become rich overnight have shown that they have no future. To believe that they will come up is a little far-fetched.Finally, please do as much research as possible before you enter into this. This is definitely a high-risk asset class. I think it is a very promising asset class. This is all that I invest in but still lots of research is required."
