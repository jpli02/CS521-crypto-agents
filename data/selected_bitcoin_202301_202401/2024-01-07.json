        "content": "Looking for a place to spend your bitcoin in real life? It may be easier than ever, according to BTC Map's crowdsourced data. The project currently lists over 6,300 vendors that accepted bitcoin in the past year, according to user reports.\n\nThat total is nearly three times more than the number of vendors who accepted bitcoin at the end of 2022 \u2014 only 2,200, according to BTC Map's data. While some vendors have almost certainly been missed by the volunteers contributing data, the trend seems to indicate that bitcoin adoption is on the rise, despite its volatile swings in price throughout 2023.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nHowever, paying for physical goods with bitcoin could be a risky proposition. The bitcoin used to buy a $20 pizza at the beginning of 2023, for example, would be worth over $50. Infamously, the first purchase made with Bitcoin were two large pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin that would be worth $44 million at today's prices.\n\nBitcoin vendors are located around the world, but appear to be concentrated in Europe, the United States, and especially Latin America. While the Phillippines has hundreds of vendors tagged, East Asia seems to be lagging in adoption, with China's population of over 1.4 billion lacking any vendors, due to the cryptocurrency ban in the country."

        "content": "This news release constitutes a \"designated news release\" for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2023, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated May 1, 2023.\n\nVancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 8, 2024) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\") is pleased to announce the summarized unaudited production figures from the Company's global Bitcoin operations for the 2023 calendar year. Production totaled 3,260 Bitcoin mined, and hashrate increased by 100% in the 2023 calendar year, from 2 Exahash per second (\"EH/s\") at the end of December 2022 to 4 EH/s at the end of December 2023 (all amounts in US dollars, unless otherwise indicated).\n\nHIVE has maintained approximately 1% of the global Bitcoin mining network through 2023, mining an average of approximately 9 Bitcoin per day throughout the calendar year of 2023, by maintaining a growing hashrate over the course of the year, that has generally kept pace with the Bitcoin mining network hashrate growth. With the total daily block rewards of the Bitcoin mining network averaging 900 Bitcoin per day, or 328,500 Bitcoin in a calendar year, HIVE earning 3,260 Bitcoin for calendar 2023 is approximately 1% of the Bitcoin mining network.\n\nThroughout calendar 2023 the Bitcoin mining network continued to attract more efficient ASIC machines to compete for the 900 new Bitcoin mined per day, as HIVE'S network hashrate grew from approximately 2 EH/s from the beginning of 2023 to approximately 4 EH/s at the end of 2023. Accordingly, Mining Difficulty1 also increased approximately 100% year over year, from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, as per www.blockchain.com. This is how HIVE maintained approximately 1% of the total Bitcoin rewards mined in calendar 2023.\n\nHIVE ended the 2023 calendar year with approximately $17 million in cash and a Bitcoin HODL position of 1,704 BTC. As mentioned in the Company's December 19, 2023, news release, the Company's HODL strategy is such that it anticipates to be able to HODL all its Bitcoin until the upcoming Halving which is expected to be in April 2024 after which the number of new Bitcoin mined per day will drop to 450 Bitcoins per day.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitmain S19k Pro Update\n\nHIVE also announces that further to its news releases dated November 14, 2023, and December 4, 2023, all 9,800 of the Bitmain S19k Pro Antminers ordered by the Company have shipped. Currently approximately 70% have been installed, and it is expected that 100% of these machines will be installed before January 2024 month-end. After these miners are installed, it is expected that HIVE will have 4.8 EH/s of ASICs with an average fleet efficiency of 28.7 J/TH.\n\nIn addition, further to its news release dated December 21, 2023, upon the completion of the installation of the 7,000 Bitmain S21 Antminers ordered in December 2023, which will begin in January 2024 and is expected to be completed in June 2024, it is expected that HIVE will have an average fleet efficiency of 25 J/TH and a total of 5.6 EH/s of active mining capacity.\n\nAbout HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\n\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. went public in 2017 as the first cryptocurrency mining company listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange with a sustainable green or renewable energy focus. HIVE's electricity is sourced from hydro and geothermal facilities in Sweden, Canada and Iceland.\n\nHIVE is a growth-oriented technology stock in the emergent blockchain industry. As a company whose shares trade on major stock exchanges, we are building a bridge between the digital currency and blockchain sector and traditional capital markets. HIVE owns green energy-powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland, where we endeavour to source green energy to mine digital assets such as Bitcoin on the cloud. Since the beginning of 2021, HIVE has held in secure storage the majority of its treasury of BTC derived from mining rewards. Our shares provide investors with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining, as well as a portfolio of Bitcoin. Because HIVE also owns hard assets such as data centers and advanced multi-use servers, we believe our shares offer investors an attractive way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWe encourage you to visit HIVE's YouTube channel here to learn more about HIVE.\n\nFor more information and to register to HIVE's mailing list, please visit www.HIVEdigitaltechnologies.com.
