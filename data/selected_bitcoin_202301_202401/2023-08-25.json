        "content": "The recent selloff in crypto markets is likely near an end, with long-position liquidations \u201clargely behind us,\u201d according to a research report by JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThe fading of some positive legal and regulatory news induced a wave of selling in recent weeks that is \u201cstill reverberating,\u201d though the unwinding appears to be at its end phase, based on open interest in CME Bitcoin futures contracts, analysts including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote on Thursday. A decline in open interest - the number of unsettled and active future contracts trading on exchanges - typically indicates a price trend is losing strength."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose and Ether fell during Friday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Solana\u2019s SOL was the day\u2019s biggest loser, failing to capitalize on Thursday\u2019s rally fueled by its partnership announcement with e-commerce firm Shopify on Thursday.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$26,000 following Evergrande\u2019s bankruptcy\n\nSOL erases Shopify boost\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token fell 4.69% in the 24 hours to 4:30 in Hong Kong to US$20.67, as the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, giving up most of the gains made Thursday, when Solana announced a partnership with Shopify to offer crypto payments via Solana Pay, a peer-to-peer payments protocol built on the blockchain.\n\nThe XRP token was the day\u2019s second biggest loser in the top 10, falling 3.18% to US$0.5115, which marks a six-week low for the coin, reversing nearly all the progress made since Ripple\u2019s partial victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month.\n\nBitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia at US$26,098 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after briefly dipping US$25,966 earlier in the day.\n\nThe world\u2019s first cryptocurrency has been weighed down by numerous factors, including large holders selling during a low-liquidity period, according to Alex Konanykhin, the chief executive officer and founder of Unicoin, an equity-backed crypto that pays dividends.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is inherently volatile. Its price can be driven down by negative news or by a large sale, especially in late summer when liquidity is at its lowest.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also cautiously anticipating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday, which may signal more rate hikes or a negative attitude towards digital assets.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies compete with fiat currencies, so a Fed Chairman may not possibly see Bitcoin as anything but a pesky competitor. Chairman Powell is likely to be negative about Bitcoin but it\u2019s nothing new: many regulators have made negative statements about cryptocurrencies,\u201d wrote Konanykhin in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nStory continues\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 1.62% to US$1.05 trillion while market volume decreased 12.34% to US$28.43 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nForkast 500 sees rare rise\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.41% to 2,279.88 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 6.90% in the past week.\n\nSolana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) sales rose 124.43% to US$2.29 million after the new Meegos collection reached over US$1.1 million in sales during the past 24 hours. The Forkast SOL NFT Composite fell 1.23% in the past 24 hours, suggesting that liquidity from established Solana-native collections is flowing into the Meegos collection.\n\ngmaz2xwjXEM7LnSswmJFAnqAXsccdBdRfJHpI25G3eRkY2irRfqW2FfS6UlNsciWKx C760jlxaMfav3hLoMdTscdt1OXMUlKLcqYcQ6nU7KIVMej3v8\n\n\u201cSolana is having a big day of sales, up over 122% and now in the #2 spot on CryptoSlam\u2019s blockchain rankings. A majority of these sales are behind a new PFP collection called Meegos, which was created by Blocksmith Labs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 11.89% to US$8.67 million, but that of the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 11.33% to US$1.23 million. DeGods sales rose over 309% to US$883,229, making it the third largest NFT collection across all chains by 24-hour sales volume.\n\nAsian equities fall, U.S. stock futures gain ahead of Powell\u2019s speech\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities fell as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong on Friday, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all declining.\n\nBeijing proposed that local governments scrap a rule that disqualifies people with previous mortgages from being considered first-time homebuyers in major cities, in an attempt to halt the slump in the mainland\u2019s residential property market. Yet, the move failed to boost investor sentiment.\n\nInvestors worldwide were cautiously anticipating key speeches by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium later today, for signs on future interest rate decisions.\n\nBoth the euro and the British pound hit a new two-month low ahead of today\u2019s speeches.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures rose for a fourth consecutive day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all posting gains.\n\nSee related article: Singapore\u2019s Stablecoin framework, Australia\u2019s crypto landscape & Binance shuts \u2018Connect\u2019\n\n(Updates with equities section)"

        "title": "These 3 Buy-Rated Bitcoin Mining Companies Are Poise To Run! - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Is the cryptocurrency market back? That\u2019s one of the most common questions we hear on the web, as Coinbase was recently approved to offer cryptocurrency futures trading to retail investors in the United States by the National Futures Association (NFA). This is a big win for crypto enthusiasts, as Coinbase previously only offered the derivatives to institutional investors. Some say this has opened the floodgates to potential buyers and sellers of BTC and ETH futures, increasing the currency's adoption in the financial market. How does this regulatory approval affect the market as a whole?\n\nAccording to industry expert Denis Sklyarov, co-founder and CEO of WiFi Map, \u201cThe approval granted to Coinbase for listing regulated and leveraged crypto futures in the US is a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency industry. It demonstrates digital assets' growing acceptance and integration into traditional financial markets\u201d.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable buying the currency derivatives themselves, you may check out companies that mine them as a potential proxy for the currencies\u2019 possible performance. Here are three buy-rated Bitcoin mining companies we think you should watch.\n\nCleanSpark Inc. (\n\nCLSK\n\n)\n\nCleanSpark, Inc. is an industrial-scale Bitcoin mining and infrastructure company. Its subsidiaries, CleanBlok, Inc. and ATL Data Centers LLC, operate the company\u2019s Bitcoin mining operations. CLSK also owns and maintains actual property holdings through its other subsidiaries, CSRE Property Management Company, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, LLC, and CSRE Properties, LLC; it maintains real property holdings for ATL Data Centers LLC and CleanBlok Inc. The company also owns Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc., which provides a Bitcoin mining facility with an output of nearly 560 petahashes per second (PH/s)in Sandersville, Georgia.\n\nCleanSpark recently announced that its acquisitions of new facilities will be going live to further assist in mining operations. These acquisitions are predicted to provide substantial output efficiency in its operations.\n\nAnalyst Rating\n\nAnalysts have high expectations for CLSK, as everyone covering the company issued it a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendation. The mean target price for CLSK is $11.25, with a high target of $14.00, an upside potential of almost 3x.\n\nCipher Mining (\n\nCIFR\n\n)\n\nCipher Mining Inc. is a technology company that operates and develops bitcoin mining data centers on an industrial scale. Cipher Mining\u2019s operations include four Bitcoin mining data centers in Texas. Its Odessa, Texas facility has a production capacity of approximately 4.2 exahash per second (EH/s). Its chief data center (the \u201cChief\u201d facility) in Andrews, Texas, is a 10 MW center directly connected to the electrical grid. CIFR also operates another data center in Andrews (\u201cBear\u201d) and one more in Happy, Texas (\u201cAlborz\u201d).\n\nThe company\u2019s plans for a 30MW expansion at its Bear and Chief site will put it in good standing in reaching its target of 8.7 EH/s, just in time for 2024\u2019s Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAnalyst Rating\n\nAnalysts rate CIFR as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d based on 4 Strong Buy and 1 Buy recommendation. The mean target price for CIFR is set to $5.10, with a high target price of $6.00, a potential upside of 104%.\n\nRiot Platforms, Inc. (\n\nRIOT\n\n)\n\nRiot Platforms, Inc. is a Bitcoin mining company supporting the expansion of the evergrowing Bitcoin community\u2019s blockchain. Riot offers services focused on enhancing its Bitcoin mining capabilities and customers' ability to mine Bitcoin at an institutional scale. This is done using the critical and comprehensive mining infrastructure in its 700-megawatt Rockdale facility.\n\nRIOT operates in three main segments:\n\nBitcoin Mining\n\nEngineering\n\nData Center Hosting\n\nRIOT currently owns approximately 88,500 miners, which has a capacity of 9.7 exahash per second (EH/s). The company also designs custom-engineered electrical products and manufactures power distribution equipment as part of its engineering segment.\n\nAnalyst Rating\n\nRIOT is still one of the top recommendations of analysts in its sector. Experts have high hopes for RIOT with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating from 6 Strong buys,1 Buy, and 1 Hold recommendation. The mean target for RIOT is $18.61, and the high target price is $24.00, with an upside potential of 132%.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile some may argue that the cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages, we can\u2019t deny that some investors are bullish on their technological outlook. The increasing adoption and application of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies are slowly building a foundation for continued progress. These and their inclusion in the financial markets have added another win for pro-crypto investors.\n\nMore Stock Market News from Barchart\n\nApple Stock: Buy the 10% Dip Because the Future Looks Bright Stocks Tumble on a Sell-Off in Mega-Cap Tech Stocks 3 Energy Stocks to Add to Your Dividend Portfolio 5 Proven Ways to Cut Travel Costs in RetirementOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
