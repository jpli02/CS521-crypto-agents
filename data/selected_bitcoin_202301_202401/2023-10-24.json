        "content": "watch now\n\nThe price of bitcoin briefly topped $35,000 for the first time since May 2022, bolstered by positive sentiment about a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and a flight to safety that led to a spike in short liquidations. On Tuesday bitcoin rose 7.97% at $33,900.00, according to Coin Metrics. Late Monday night it reached as much as $35,113.29, its highest level since May 8, 2022. Bitcoin is now up 104% from the start of the year and 105% from its 2022 low. The rally could be fueled in part by investors who were betting against the crypto asset scrambling to cover short positions, in other words, by a short squeeze. Bitcoin saw $275.45 million in short liquidations on Sunday, followed by another $100.44 million Monday, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. \"The real catalyst that created the 'god candle' [Monday] and pushed bitcoin above $34,000 was the $167 million in short liquidations, mainly on offshore exchanges,\" Ryan Rasmussen, analyst at Bitwise Asset Management, told CNBC. \"I don't think anyone expected the level of price action we're seeing, and those investors who were shorting bitcoin in the $33,000 plus range are certainly feeling the pain of that surprise.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin rises to 17-month high as ETF optimism soars - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nBitcoin hit a 17-month high on Tuesday, recouping the losses it sustained in last year\u2019s crash, on rising speculation that US regulators will approve stock market funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe price of the digital currency leapt more than 10 per cent in the past 24 hours to $35,000 a token as traders grew increasingly confident the Securities and Exchange Commission would approve an exchange-traded fund in coming months.\n\nIts sharp rise meant that bitcoin, the oldest and most actively traded token, has pulled back all the losses it made in the wake of the failure of the Terra stablecoin last May.\n\nTerra\u2019s sudden downfall sparked an unprecedented crisis of confidence and the collapse of a string of high-profile companies, including lender Celsius and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s surge has been driven by hopes that in coming months the SEC will resile its decade-long policy of refusing to approve spot ETFs, a stock market fund that hold bitcoins. Wall Street names such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have joined companies such as VanEck and WisdomTree in submitting filings with the SEC.\n\n\u201cThe SEC accepting a spot bitcoin ETF application would validate bitcoin as an established asset class alongside all other asset classes,\u201d said Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex, a London-based broker.\n\n\u201cIt could close the book on rogue and unregulated institutions leading the way on crypto. Major institutions would now have a buy-in into the sector,\u201d he added.\n\nCrypto advocates have said such funds offer consumers a cheap and safe way to trade the token, instead of buying it directly from unregulated crypto exchanges.\n\nThe SEC has argued that it cannot offer investors reassurance that the bitcoin market is not prone to being manipulated.\n\nHowever, the regulator has been under pressure since the summer after a Washington court ruled the agency was wrong to reject an application by asset manager Grayscale to turn its flagship vehicle, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, into an ETF.\n\nTraders said Tuesday\u2019s gains were driven by the listing of BlackRock\u2019s planned bitcoin ETF at the US securities market\u2019s main clearing house.\n\nIt came days after an updated filing from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, which said that an unnamed investor planned to buy shares in the ETF. The move is common for new or upcoming ETFs in search of fresh capital.\n\n\u201cEvery day, we get news further solidifying the common consensus that the SEC will approve the variety of bitcoin spot ETFs,\u201d said Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at Alt Tab Capital.\n\nTraders have been positioning themselves for a jump in bitcoin price if an ETF is approved. Earlier this month it rose by more than 8 per cent as false rumours circulated on social media that BlackRock\u2019s application had been approved.\n\nCoinShares, an investment group, said that investors had put $179mn into digital asset funds over the past four weeks and were \u201clikely linked to excitement\u201d over a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nHowever, it noted the flows were below the $807mn that flowed into funds in the four weeks after BlackRock made its first filing last June. It suggests \u201ca more cautious approach from investors this time around,\u201d it said in a research note.\n\nThe SEC is due to make its first rulings on the ETF filings at the start of next year."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged above $35,000 in its largest single-day jump in 13 months, fueled by optimism that regulatory approval of the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund is nearing.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency moved up more than 10% Monday, its biggest increase over a 24-hour period since September 2022. The price reached its highest point in a year and a half.\n\nThe stocks of digital asset companies also pushed higher. Coinbase (COIN), the largest US crypto exchange, opened 13% higher Tuesday while MicroStrategy (MSTR) rose 12%. Bitcoin mining firms Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) surged more than 13% and 17%, respectively.\n\nThe rally appeared to be driven partly by speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission was close to granting approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) is among the money managers that have recently applied to launch such a product.\n\nThe BlackRock logo is pictured outside the money manager's headquarters in Manhattan. (Carlo Allegri/REUTERS) (Carlo Allegri / reuters)\n\nBitcoin backers pointed to the listing of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust on the website of clearing house Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), while also cheering a suggestion that BlackRock had begun seeding the fund.\n\nA spokesman for DTCC said Tuesday evening that its \"standard practice\" for the company to add securities to its list, which includes \"active and potential\" ETFs, in preparation for the launch of a new ETF to the market and that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF was added in August 2023.\n\n\"Appearing on the list is simply an indication that an agent bank has requested a DTCC identifier for an ETF fund, and that DTCC may process that transaction at an undetermined date,\" said the DTCC spokesman. It \"is not indicative of an outcome for any outstanding regulatory or other approval processes,\" they added.\n\nSpeculation about BlackRock also drove prices higher last week when a rumor circulated that the SEC had granted its approval for the spot bitcoin ETF. Prices pulled back when BlackRock denied it. Investors expect the agency will rule on the applications by Jan. 10.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is another factor behind this week\u2019s price swings, according to crypto market data aggregator Coinglass. Over the past 24 hours, $231 million worth of levered positions on bitcoin have been liquidated by investors, 80% of which were short the digital asset.\n\nThe dramatic movements over the last few weeks have some in the crypto community celebrating a return of the enthusiasm that characterized the industry during the early days of the pandemic.\n\n\"We are so back,\" Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWe are so back. \u2014 Alex Svanevik \ud83d\udc27 (@ASvanevik) October 23, 2023\n\nBitcoin peaked at $68,789 in November 2021 but then crashed in 2022 as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates and a series of firms imploded, including crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now on trial in Manhattan for multiple counts of fraud.\n\nA widespread crackdown on the crypto industry followed. The SEC sued a number of big players, including Coinbase and Binance.\n\nBut since the beginning of January, bitcoin has more than doubled. MicroStrategy, the Virginia-based software company, is the largest public company holding bitcoin. Its stash of 158,245 BTC is currently worth roughly $5.4 billion as of Tuesday morning.\n\nIn various tweets over the past month, the company\u2019s founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, who stepped down as CEO in August 2022, has said of bitcoin that the asset is \"a flight to safety,\" \"digital energy,\" \"for the kids,\" \"power,\" and \"forever.\"\n\nUpdated 10/25 with DTCC comments.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
