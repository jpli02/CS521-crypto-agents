        "title": "Bitcoin's Volatility Is Decreasing -- Here's Why It's Good News for Investors - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -0.21%) has long been criticized for its high volatility, which is often cited as a major barrier to adopting the cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment. However, in recent years, its volatility has been steadily decreasing, and this trend looks poised to continue in the future.\n\nHere's why this shift could be the under-the-radar catalyst that leads to Bitcoin's continued success in the coming years and decades.\n\nWhy Bitcoin is volatile\n\nTo start, let's look at why Bitcoin experiences such dramatic price fluctuations. First, it is traded internationally 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It isn't limited to set hours like the stock market. With people all over the world trading at all hours of the day, substantial swings can and do occur.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin is a relatively new asset. With limited historical data, the market struggles to assign an accurate price, which can also lead to sudden price swings. Unlike traditional assets, which have a history of finding fair value in particular economic conditions, Bitcoin is constantly under pressure to find a more accurate valuation depending on market sentiment, recent news events, and investor behavior.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin remains more volatile than traditional assets like stocks or bonds, there is a clear trend that its volatility has been tempering since the cryptocurrency was invented in 2009, with a considerable decline since 2022.\n\nBut why is this and how can it benefit investors?\n\nA substantial shift\n\nThere may be several reasons Bitcoin is becoming less volatile.\n\nOne of the primary draws of Bitcoin for investors is its use as a store of value. Many investors are now treating Bitcoin as a long-term investment option, rather than a short-term speculative asset. As more people start holding on to their Bitcoin for longer periods of time, the demand for Bitcoin will become more stable, resulting in less price volatility.\n\nIn addition, the Bitcoin market is maturing. The world's first cryptocurrency is no longer just a niche investment alternative for a few tech-savvy investors. It's now a mainstream investment option for millions of people and even some institutions.\n\nThe combination of these factors helped Bitcoin's total market cap rebound and stabilize after plunging last year. The market cap size alone -- now at almost $600 billion, bigger than all but a handful of companies -- makes it harder for large traders or institutional investors to swing the price of Bitcoin, which in turn has reduced its volatility. In other words, the larger Bitcoin's market cap becomes, the harder it is for large buy or sell orders to have an effect on the price.\n\nThe opportunity at hand\n\nSo why is the decreasing volatility of Bitcoin a good thing for investors? Well, quite simply, it turns the narrative of high volatility on its head. Rapidly fluctuating prices have been one of the primary reasons risk-averse investors shied away, but as Bitcoin's volatility decreases, its risk profile becomes more akin to that of other traditional assets that are found in most portfolios. In time, the cryptocurrency could become a more attractive option for portfolios of all risk levels.\n\nEven better, as more investors begin to see Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, the demand for the cryptocurrency should continue to grow, which will in turn not only help to stabilize its price but cause it to rise as the pressures of increased demand meets Bitcoin's finite supply of 21 million coins.\n\nThis won't happen overnight, but data show Bitcoin's volatility has been diminishing over the years. Ahead of the day when Bitcoin becomes a legitimate asset for investors of all risk levels, it makes investing today a promising opportunity with the cryptocurrency still almost 60% below its all-time high."

        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the largest sectors in crypto. The applications within the DeFi space consist of decentralized trading, borrowing and lending, and many more financial services. However, even with its rising popularity, the sector has many obstacles to overcome before mass adoption is possible.\n\nThe rise of DeFi\n\nThe growth of DeFi\u2019s popularity was volatile and quick, which follows suit with the overall development of the crypto industry. During the peaks of 2021, the sector saw almost $180 billion in total value locked in the many protocols that still exist today. Of course, the DeFi space also got hit by the crypto winter.\n\nRecently, DeFi stood out in the market upturn during the first quarter of 2023. The DeFi space rose $29.6 billion in value, making the sector stand out against the performances of major asset classes like gold and oil.\n\nThe popularity of DeFi can be attributed to the increasing amount of decentralized applications (DApps) and the flow of users from centralized to decentralized exchanges, among other reasons. However, while the increasing popularity is a positive development, there are some caveats.\n\nRise in transaction costs\n\nOne of the caveats is the rising transaction costs once more users start using a network. Investors experienced this during the bull market in 2021; the Ethereum (ETH) network saw a large influx of transactions, mainly happening within the DeFi space. The result was steeply rising transaction costs on the network. Sending crypto became so expensive that users faced a significant barrier to interacting with DeFi DApps.\n\nAnother risk is that of vulnerabilities such as smart contract back door keys, massive centralization on single contracts, and counter-party risks of custodial stablecoins. With numerous bridge hacks plaguing the space, and failures of algorithmic protocols such as Terra, using DeFi DApps is certainly not without risk. However, the industry keeps evolving, with many new platforms aiming to improve the issues and challenges current DApps deal with.\n\nDeFi on Bitcoin Cash\n\nThanks to the continuous development since its foundation in 2017, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can also perform as a vibrant environment for smart contract deployment and the creation of DeFi DApps on its UTXO mainchain. One new project that has recently launched is BCH Bull.\n\nWith the help of the AnyHedge protocol, BCH Bull lets users create long or hedge positions on several assets, such as the United States dollar, Bitcoin (BTC) and gold. Users can even add leverage to their on-chain trades. Roger Ver, a well-known Bitcoin Cash supporter and early investor in AnyHedge, said about this use case: \u201cAllowing people to permissionlessly lock the value of their Bitcoin Cash to the price of external legacy currencies is an incredibly useful tool for people who don\u2019t want to deal with cryptocurrency price volatility. That\u2019s why I chose to invest in AnyHedge.\u201d\n\nSource: BCH Bull\n\nScalable and no centralized smart contract risks\n\nThe main difference between comparable apps on Ethereum is that each trade has its own independent smart contract. Once two traders agree on the terms, the smart contract is initiated. This eliminates centralized security risks for smart contracts.\n\nFurthermore, the UTXO-based protocol of Bitcoin Cash prevents high transaction fees and makes the chain scalable, meaning fees don\u2019t increase even if the transaction volume on the network increases.\n\nSince October 2022, BCH Bull has been in beta, in which it has already created and redeemed over 3,000 smart contracts. The project has now been released into full production mode this month. Its growing user base can now initiate up to 90-day-long contracts at 2~3x the previous contract size, enjoying the security and scalability that Bitcoin Cash offers.\n\nLearn more about BCH Bull"
