        "content": "Share:\n\nPopular strategy analyst Benjamin Cowen has forecasted a bearish month for Bitcoin this September.\n\nIn his opinion, the month has proven gloomy for BTC historically, characterized by negative averages incomparable to any other month.\n\nWith this, Cowen predicts a 10% slump to test the $23,000 psychological level.\n\nRegarding altcoins, he anticipates a recovery inspired by a confluence of macro tailwinds to steer the market into 2024.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has historically hurt traders that take long positions in September, with strategy analyst Benjamin Cowen predicting double-digit losses this month, potentially testing levels last seen in February.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC correlation to DJIA hits 2021 peak levels amid ETF hype.\n\nBitcoin could fall 10% in September\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price could fall at least 10% in September, according to Cowen, a strategy analyst who explored the bearish outlook displayed by BTC historically during this month. With the flagship crypto back in the $25,000 range after the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) delayed decisions on spot BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) filing, the analyst says:\n\nSeptember just tends to not be a great month for crypto. Bitcoin \u2013 you can see \u2013 it averages negative in September, by a long shot, much worse than any other month.\n\nThe analyst retraced the \u201cseasonality of Bitcoin,\u201d highlighting that momentum indicators add credence to his analysis. In his opinion, the fact that BTC closed the month of August below the $27,000 psychological level increased the odds for a deep correction to $23,000 in September.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhat about altcoins?\n\nRegarding altcoins, the analyst predicts this class of assets \u201ccoming back to life,\u201d possibly driven by a confluence of macro factors that would bode well for the altcoin category in 2024.\n\nCowen\u2019s thesis for altcoins in 2024 sprouts from the Bitcoin halving, expected in early 2024. The halving season is characterized by volatility, which could go higher considering the US Elections, defined by massive market uncertainty. For one, incumbents looking to stay in power are likely to inject political pressure as a campaign strategy to entice voters with less stringent monetary policies, hence volatility.\n\nThe analyst also bases his postulate on the ongoing \u201crate-hikes,\u201d with the Federal Reserve showing more aggression this cycle than ever.\n\n\u2026at this rate, we are likely to start seeing the labor market show noticeable effects from all these interest rate hikes by the end of this year, early next year.\n\nA weakening labor market coupled with easing inflation as chatter about a recession lingers will likely influence the Fed to pause the rate hikes to help companies stay afloat. This could pave the way for a \u201cquantitative easing return\u201d in the market, possibly allowing altcoins to thrive."

        "content": "Two years ago, El Salvador stunned the world by becoming the first country to make bitcoin an official currency. Journalists from around the world traveled to the Central American nation of 6.3 million people, known for its beaches and its diaspora in the United States, to document the new monetary reality. September 7, 2021, when the new cryptocurrency law came into effect, was an atypical moment in which a small country briefly held the attention of the entire world.\n\nInterest has waned, but the experiment continues. It is tempting to classify the Bitcoin Law \u2014 the name for the legislative project that made the digital asset legal tender \u2014 as a success or a failure. But nothing is so simple in President Nayib Bukele\u2019s El Salvador. The country\u2019s decision to make bitcoin an official currency is difficult to analyze because it is an opaque experiment with several different objectives: financial inclusion, revenue for the public treasury and building the reputation of the president.\n\nThe experiment began with several bitcoin purchases by the Bukele government. The exact amount of bitcoin that El Salvador has in its international reserves is not known, since the government does not keep a public record. The closest thing that exists to a purchase announcement are Bukele\u2019s brief posts on social media. The website nayibtracker.com maintains its own account and estimates that El Salvador has lost 37% of the value of its investments in bitcoin, since the cryptocurrency began to fall in 2021. That\u2019s the equivalent of $45 million. It is estimated that El Salvador currently has $76.5 million worth of bitcoin. As often happens in the crypto world, the website does not include information about the bitcoin owners or who manages the assets.\n\nA protest against bitcoin in El Salvador on June 1. Alex Pe\u00f1a (Getty Images)\n\nWhen introducing the currency to the population, the idea was that it be used in all types of transactions: from buying street food to a property. With this goal in mind, the government opened a digital wallet called Chivo, and gave every citizen the equivalent of $30 in bitcoin. But hundreds of the Chivo accounts were hacked, and the money was stolen along with the account owner\u2019s identity.\n\nThis perhaps scared many in El Salvador. One of the benefits of cryptocurrencies is the speed with which remittances can be sent from abroad \u2014 an advantage that was promoted by the Salvadoran government. But so far this year, only 1.3% of remittances have been transferred using digital wallets that use cryptocurrencies, according to the most recent data from the central bank. In comparison, 4% of remittances sent to Mexico are made through cryptocurrencies, according to the specialized firm Chainalysis.\n\nLast week, an investment research firm called Ark Invest made waves on social media when it published a report claiming that bitcoin adoption in Argentina surpasses that of El Salvador. \u201cUnderstandably, the citizens of El Salvador prefer to transact in USD, which became legal tender in El Salvador in 2001 and has protected purchasing power from the inflation and devaluations that have ravaged other countries in the region,\u201d stated the report signed by analyst David Puell. \u201cIn contrast, the price of bitcoin has been quite volatile in the face of growing pains as it endeavors to evolve into a monetary system with increased liquidity and global adoption.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis news makes a lot of sense,\u201d said M\u00f3nica Taher, vice president at RocketFuel, a global cryptocurrency payment processing company. Until October, Taher was the director of technology and innovation for the Bukele government\u2019s business promotion agency, InvestSV. In addition to the size difference between Argentina and El Salvador, a cluster of technology companies has been growing organically in Argentina for at least two decades, and today are industry leaders, explains Taher.\n\nDuring her time in the government, she was in charge of attracting and guiding companies interested in operating in El Salvador. \u201cAn avalanche of companies came \u2014 we didn\u2019t know what to do with them all,\u201d recalls the former official. \u201cEveryone was excited, especially the first year, and it was very nice to see a kind of reverse migration: it wasn\u2019t the Salvadorans who were migrating to the United States, now it was foreigners from every country in the world there were who decided to move.\u201d\n\nSeeing the interest of companies in El Salvador, the Central African Republic announced in April 2022 that it would make bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies legal tender. But their experiment failed, and less than a year later Congress reversed the legislation.\n\n\u201cThe goal, for me, of using bitcoin in El Salvador is to increase people\u2019s economic freedom so that there are no intermediaries and, within that, to empower women to control their own finances,\u201d said Taher. But \u201cif there is no coherent educational process, mass adoption will take a long time in the country,\u201d she warned.\n\nA few months ago, the Bukele government granted Bitfinix \u2014 a company founded in Hong Kong in 2012 \u2014 the country\u2019s first license for digital assets, such as equities and bonds. Bitfinix and its sister company, Thether, had to stop operating in New York in February 2021, when the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office declared that they \u201crecklessly and unlawfully covered-up\u201d losses of $850 million. A few months later, U.S. regulators fined Tether Holdings $41 million for making untrue or misleading statements by claiming that its token was a stablecoin, with its value pegged to a fiat currency.\n\nThe move to bitcoin has been an undeniable success for El Salvador, says Andr\u00e9s Engler, a journalist specialized in cryptocurrencies and former editor for Latin America of the crypto website Coindesk. \u201cIn terms of press, it put Bukele in the headlines,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is indisputable. With respect to the crypto industry, El Salvador today is a strong figure. If you ask anyone in the industry about El Salvador, they will recognize it and will probably name Bukele straight away.
