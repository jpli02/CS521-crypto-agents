Sadly for the crypto crowd, that\u2019s also the best argument for why nobody needs a new one.\n\nProponents say that the arrival of a US spot ETF would open the floodgates to a new wave of investors, potentially ushering in more than $50 billion of demand. A fresh batch of applications led by asset management titan BlackRock Inc. reignited optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission may finally give its blessing after more than a decade of denials, powering a 20% Bitcoin rally since mid-June."

        "title": "Top Alternatives to Bitcoin - Zilliqa (ZIL), Tradecurve (TCRV) and Chainlink (LINK) - The Economic Times",
        "content": "In this story, we explore three top alternatives to Bitcoin: Zilliqa (ZIL), Chainlink (LINK), and Tradecurve (TCRV). These coins have captured attention with their unique features, strong fundamentals, and growth potential. Let's dive into the critical aspects of each coin and why they present exciting investment opportunities in the coming year.\n\nSummary\n\nZilliqa (ZIL) releases a new update\n\nChainlink (LINK) price analysis\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) provides early buyers with an 80% ROI\n\nZilliqa (ZIL): Security and Scalability\n\nZilliqa (ZIL) is a blockchain platform that addresses many cryptocurrency scalability challenges. The native cryptocurrency of Zilliqa is crucial in securing the network, executing smart contracts, and incentivizing participants.\n\nAlso, the mainnet network update v9.2 for Zilliqa was released recently. Critically, the Zilliqa network significantly benefited from this update. In particular, by enhancing the compatibility between the Zilliqa smart contract language, Scilla, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nCurrently, Zilliqa has a value of $0.02007 with a market cap of $318M, a drop of 2.14% overnight.\n\nChainlink (LINK): Focus on Smart Contracts\n\nChainlink (LINK) connects smart contracts with real-world data and external APIs. Smart contracts on blockchain networks often lack access to real-time information, and Chainlink (LINK) solves this problem by securely providing external data feeds. The native cryptocurrency of Chainlink incentivizes node operators and secures the network.\n\nCurrently, Chainlink is trading hands at $6.12 with a market cap of $3.2B, down 1.49% in the past day alone. However, the trading volume of Chainlink has increased by 22.46% in that same time and now sits at $116,310,694.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of smart contracts and the demand for reliable and accurate external data, Chainlink has gained significant attention from developers and enterprises. Its unique value proposition and growing ecosystem make it a compelling alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV): Innovative Trading Platform\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) is a comprehensive platform integrating derivatives and cryptocurrency trading. With its privacy-focused approach and innovative features, including a metaverse trading academy, negative balance protection, and level-up bonuses, Tradecurve will benefit both beginner and experienced traders.\n\nAdditionally, this borderless trading platform incorporates the best components of centralized and decentralized exchanges, so expect to see low latency, slippage-free trading, fast order execution, and more.\n\nOn Tradecurve, all users can trade all derivatives on a single account that can be created quickly, as no sign-up KYC checks will be necessary. Over 15,000 users have registered for Tradecurve so far, showcasing their faith in its long-term growth potential.\n\nThe native token of Tradecurve adds utility to the platform, providing benefits such as reduced fees and access to exclusive features. Currently, it is available for just $0.018 - an 80% surge from its starting price. With over $2.8M raised so far, Tradecurve may even overtake the likes of Huobi.\n\nAs more traders seek enhanced trading experiences and diversified investment opportunities, Tradecurve (TCRV) stands out as a promising alternative to Bitcoin - so sign up for its presale below.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Bitcoin and Ether both fell below key price levels earlier but returned above as investors remained optimistic after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accepted the second Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application for review, from asset manager Valkyrie.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin rises past US$31,000, cryptos rally after Ripple\u2019s win against U.S. SEC\n\nBitcoin, Ether, top 10 cryptos drop\n\nBitcoin slipped during the Asia trading day to US$30,067 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, after it dipped to US$29,685 in the early morning.\n\nEther inched down 0.47% during afternoon trading in Asia, to change hands at US$1,904. Mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s price movement, Ether also fell to US$1,875 earlier today before recovering US$1,900.\n\nSolana\u2019s Sol token was the day\u2019s biggest loser, falling 5.9% in the past 24 hours to US$25.96, followed by Dogecoin that declined 3.06% to US$0.06909.\n\nWithin a week, the SEC accepted a second spot Bitcoin ETF application for review, from asset management giant Valkyrie. The news comes after the SEC on July 13 accepted asset manager BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF for review. This signals the SEC\u2019s intent to seriously consider the ETF applications.\n\n\u201cPositive news regarding Bitcoin ETFs could significantly boost investor sentiment,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF would be a major step toward mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, signaling regulatory confidence and potentially paving the way for significant institutional investment. News like this could trigger a bullish market reaction, pushing Bitcoin\u2019s price above US$31,000.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 1.36% to US$1.2 trillion while market volume increased 39.87% to US$36.31 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin NFT sales fall, Ethereum NFT sales recover\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.22% to 2,717.04 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and slipped 0.42% during the week.\n\nAfter a strong Monday, Bitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales decreased 22.19% to US$1.28 million, as sales for Uncategorized Ordinals fell 8.03% to US$590,582.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales recovered after yesterday\u2019s slump, rising 8.62% to US$13.86 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 52.75% to US$711,081. Last Friday, Yuga Labs, the company behind The Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, announced that it will hold ApeFest, an event to celebrate the firm\u2019s NFT collections, in Hong Kong, at the beginning of November.\n\nOn Ethereum, sales for Opepen Edition rose 64.07% to US$803,088 and CryptoPunks sales gained 7.33% to US$767,020.\n\n\u201cOpepen has traded for over US$727,000 in 24 hours after catching on with the NFT community in a big way this weekend,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cInfluencers and even large Web3 entities like OpenSea and Rarible are getting in on the fun by changing their profile pictures to an Opepen that matches their brand. Opepen is an interesting hybrid project that merges conceptual art into easy-to-digest profile pictures.\u201d\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast ETH NFT Composite and the Forkast POL NFT Composite were also in the red.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures fall, following Evergrande\u2019s US$81 bln loss\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities weakened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, the Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index all declining while the Shenzhen Component inched up.\n\nAdding to negative investor sentiment, Chinese property development giant China Evergrande posted a US$81 billion loss over the past two years, in its earnings report published on Monday.\n\nU.S. stock futures also fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, except the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures. The S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures both weakened.\n\nInvestors now look ahead to earnings reports from Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Lockheed Martin, scheduled for later today.\n\nThe euro rose to a 17-month high, rising 0.11% on Tuesday to US$1.12, its highest since February 2022. Eurozone inflation also declined to a 17-month low of 5.5% in June, as markets are expecting another interest rate hike from the European Central Bank.\n\nSee related article: EU publishes draft bill for digital euro and cash payments\n\nUpdates with equities section"

        "content": "Bitcoin slipped under US$30,000 in Wednesday morning trading in Asia on the back of profit-taking and liquidation of long positions after the recent run up on optimism spot exchange-traded funds for the token may win approval and attract institutional investment. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also declined in lower trading volume. Ripple\u2019s XRP token was the exception, gaining almost 4% in early Asia trade as the tailwind continued from the company\u2019s partial victory last week in the lawsuit brought by the U.S. securities regulator.\n\nBitcoin, Ether retreat\n\nBitcoin fell below the US$30,000 line that has offered floor support since late June and lost 2.46% for the week, according to data from CryptoMarketCap. As of 06:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency traded at US$29,784.42, down 1.22% over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe token continued to fluctuate around the US$30,000 line later in the Asia morning as overall trading volume in cryptocurrencies fell more than 9% on the day.\n\nData from Coinglass showed large liquidations in long positions in Bitcoin, or bets that prices for the token would rise further.\n\nEther dropped 0.76% to US$1,898.40, though it is still logging a 1.15% gain for the week.\n\nInvestors seemed unimpressed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreeing on Monday to review the application by digital asset manager Valkyrie Investments Inc. to launch a Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe SEC agreed the same for the application by BlackRock on July 13, which along with several other Bitcoin ETF applications set off a bullish run in crypto for the past month. BlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager with US$9.4 trillion in assets. Tennessee-based Valkyrie had more than US$1 billion in assets under management in 2022.\n\nIn more background noise for crypto markets later today, Brian Armstrong \u2013 the chief executive officer of Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. \u2013 is expected to sit down with Democratic members of Congress to discuss regulation of digital assets, according to Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe SEC sued Coinbase on June 6, claiming that the exchange breached federal securities laws by offering unregistered financial securities to investors. Armstrong and other Coinbase executives have said they will fight the SEC allegations in court.\n\nThe SEC on July 13 received a setback in another lawsuit, filed more than two years ago, against Ripple Labs, when a U.S. district court ruled that Ripple Labs\u2019 programmatic sales of its XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as offerings of financial securities.\n\nThe Ripple ruling is a \u201cpotential watershed\u201d for the broader crypto market, wrote Robert Quartly-Janeiro, the chief strategy officer of Singapore-based crypto exchange Bitrue, in an email statement shared with Forkast Tuesday.\n\nXRP was the only top 10 cryptocurrency to gain on Wednesday morning, adding 3.89% to US$0.7678, further extending its weekly surge of 61.26%.\n\nLosses were led by Polygon\u2019s Matic and Solana. Polygon dipped 5.81% to US$0.7363, falling 0.36% in the past seven days.\n\nSolana lost 5.24% to US$25.33, but it\u2019s holding gains of 15.01% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 0.50% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 trillion, with trading volume dipping 9.49% to US$32.17 billion.\n\nNFT trade sinks toward yearly low\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.37% in the past 24 hours to 2,717.68 as of 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 14.05% to US$17.83 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam. Forkast NFT market indexes measuring the performance on Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano blockchains all dropped, while the Solana index rose.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on pace for another yearly low for total global transactions today, and in general, sales are pretty unremarkable across blockchains,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cThe top collections are struggling to even reach $500k in daily secondary sales, which is unusual to see. The index reflects a flat market.\u201d\n\nEthereum-based Azuki NFT collection topped trading volume, rising 3.26% to US$972,691. Uncategorized Bitcoin Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 ranked second in volume, gaining 5.05% to US$698,982.\n\nLuxury brand Louis Vuitton launched new digital collectibles on Monday celebrating its Speedy 40 VIA bag, which was designed in collaboration with American singer-songwriter Pharrell.\n\n\u201cEach [owner] will be given access to exclusive digital products, each accompanied by its physical twin,\u201d tweeted Gaspard L\u00e9zin, the NFT collection manager for Louis Vuitton, on Monday.\n\nU.S. futures flat; CME predicts 99.8% chance of Fed rate hike\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong after all three major U.S. indexes gained during regular trading on Tuesday.\n\nIn Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 gained on the bullish U.S. market session that followed upbeat earnings reports from major corporations, according to Trading Economics.\n\nHowever, most other Asian stock markets continued a downtrend after China reported lower-than-expected economic growth of 6.3% for Q2 on Monday. The Shanghai Composite fell for the third consecutive session. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi also posted losses as of 10:40 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nU.S. financial heavyweights Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley & Co. both beat analyst estimates in Q2 earnings, lifting investor sentiment. Later on Wednesday, Tesla, Netflix, United Airlines and Goldman Sachs Group all report earnings for Q2.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at the next meeting on July 26. U.S. interest rates are now at 5% to 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"
