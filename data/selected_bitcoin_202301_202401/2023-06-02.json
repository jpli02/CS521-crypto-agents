        "title": "3 Cryptos That Are Better Buys Than Bitcoin or Ethereum - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Many crypto investors will likely assert that no cryptos are better buys than Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD). To some extent, when measuring for risk-adjusted returns over the long-term, that argument holds water, as there are several high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin worth considering.\n\nHowever, not all investors are looking at crypto with the same investing time horizon or frame of reference. Over the near-term, a number of other top tokens have performed very well, and may outperform these top two cryptos over time.\n\nAmidst the backdrop of a domestic banking crisis and looming concerns over a U.S. debt default, investors are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies as potential safe haven assets to navigate the economic challenges ahead. This shift in thinking marks a significant departure from just six months ago when the prevailing belief was that the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d would persist well into 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, the question arises: Are there any genuinely secure cryptocurrencies to invest in at present? If so, which ones should investors consider adding to their portfolios this month? Here are three cryptos on the top of my list of projects that could potentially outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum over the next 2-3 years.\n\nSymbol Cryptocurrency Price XMR-USD Monero $145.68 AVAX-USD Avalanche $14.44 SOL-USD Solana $20.50\n\nMonero (XMR-USD)\n\nA concept coin for Monero (XMR) has a sparkly gold background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIntroduced in 2014, Monero (XMR-USD) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and blockchain network that prioritizes privacy. With its advanced features like stealth addresses and ring signatures, Monero ensures user anonymity. Nonetheless, this commitment to privacy has also attracted heightened regulatory attention globally. This makes it one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\nMonero is a leading privacy coin, offering complete anonymity and untraceability for its blockchain transactions. By employing advanced technology, Monero conceals the sender, recipient, and transaction amount, providing a high level of privacy. Encapsulating its ethos, with its motto \u201csecure, private, untraceable,\u201d Monero has garnered global user appeal. The rising demand for privacy coins has propelled XMR\u2019s price up by 16% over the past six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother key point is that despite regulatory and legislative scrutiny due to its potential involvement in illicit activities like international money laundering, Monero remains popular among users who are undeterred by such criticisms. The usage and value of XMR have consistently increased, with a remarkable 76% rise since 2017. Crypto enthusiasts believe that the ongoing regulation of cryptocurrencies will further drive users toward the privacy provided by Monero, indicating promising prospects for continued growth.\n\nMonero relies on Proof-of-Work for decentralized consensus and offers private, secure, and untraceable transactions through an opaque blockchain. With a default privacy setting, Monero utilizes ring confidential transactions, ring signatures, and stealth addresses. As a fungible and secure digital currency, Monero prioritizes user privacy, leading to a promising future ahead.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nGraphic of various cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum resting on a United Kingdom Union Jack flag\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rawf8\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD) started May 2023 on a bullish note, trading at $16.66. Despite the bears maintaining a price of $14 since May 18, Avalanche is now edging toward the $15 mark, aiming to regain its positive price trend. The surge in trading volume indicates increased activity on the network.\n\nRecently, Avalanche has established significant support at the $14.29 price level, acting as a pivotal point for the asset. Currently, it is trading above this immediate resistance level. However, the presence of bearish market forces persists, aiming to prevent AVAX from surpassing the next resistance level at $15.21. Despite its bearish nature in the short-term, it\u2019s still one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine sets Avalanche apart as a favored platform. Developers can now create decentralized applications on a broader scale while leveraging the advantages of a faster and more economical blockchain. The Avalanche Bridge further enhances convenience and accessibility by facilitating seamless asset transfers across multiple blockchains.\n\nThe bottom line is that Avalanche stands out as a superior choice in terms of security compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its unique feature of subnets allows the creation of both private and public blockchains, adding versatility to its network. With practical applications in the real world, Avalanche exhibits immense potential for value and growth. Despite facing a significant downturn in the 2022 bear market, Avalanche has made a remarkable recovery in 2023, positioning itself as a compelling contender in the realm of decentralized finance.\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image. Solana price predictions.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) empowers the development of decentralized applications (DApps) through its distinctive hybrid consensus model. By merging proof-of-history (PoH) with underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, Solana achieves exceptionally fast transaction processing. Furthermore, this speed makes it appealing to individual traders as well as institutional investors seeking efficient blockchain solutions.\n\nSolana, launched by the Solana Foundation in March 2020, stands out as an unconventional cryptocurrency project. It prioritizes functionality and operates on an open-source framework, utilizing blockchain technology to drive decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Notably, Solana excels in both transaction speed and cost-efficiency, ensuring scalability and rapid processing. However, the network has faced intermittent outages, impacting its value and ambitions. Some critics also raise concerns about its tokenomics favoring venture capital investors. Nonetheless, Solana remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nIn summary, Solana has seen a remarkable 100% surge this year, solidifying its position as an innovation powerhouse. In addition to this, their latest breakthrough, the Saga crypto phone, has the potential to revolutionize the crypto landscape. The Saga is an Android-powered mobile device designed to simplify and enhance crypto activities. With its pioneering Seed Vault technology, it streamlines the process of using your phone as a crypto wallet, eliminating common challenges faced by conventional phones. Experience a new level of convenience and efficiency in managing your crypto assets with the Saga crypto phone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in ETH, SOL.

        "content": "The Company\u2019s bitcoin holdings grew 44%; Bitcoin mined increased 16% in May, to 609 BTC\n\nLAS VEGAS, June 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanSpark Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending May 31, 2023.\n\n\u201cWe achieved a significant milestone during the month of May,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO. \u201cNot only do we continue to increase the amount of bitcoin in our treasury, but we also surpassed $100 million in revenue for our fiscal year to date. Importantly, we achieved this milestone with the bulk of our expansion expected to come later this year.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the amount of bitcoin we mined this month exceeded expectations, largely due to increases in operational efficiency and a brief, albeit significant, increase in transaction fees. For about five days in May, fees were elevated because of increased interest in ordinals on the blockchain. At its peak, our bitcoin production jumped to nearly 30 bitcoins in a single day, almost double our normal daily production of about 18 bitcoins. Since then, transaction fees have normalized.\u201d\n\nMay Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in May: 609\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 3,004\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of May 31: 451\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in May: 471\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 67,196 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.7 EH/s\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 471 bitcoins in May 2023 at an average of approximately $27,400 per BTC. Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $12.9 million. May daily BTC mined averaged 19.6 and reached a high of 29.6, due to a brief period of unusually high transaction fees.\n\nOperational Updates\n\nWashington. The 50MW expansion continues to track according to projected timelines, despite a series of rain delays that temporarily slowed down progress. Miners are arriving daily with all units expected to be at the facility by the end of the month. Racking has begun and energization is expected to begin in the second half of June.\n\nStory continues\n\nSandersville. Crews are making headway in prepping the land for the Company\u2019s expansion at its Sandersville site. The planned expansion will add over 6 EH/s to CleanSpark\u2019s mining operations. Additional updates about the expansion are posted from time-to-time on the Company\u2019s Twitter feed, @CleanSpark_Inc.\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122.

        "title": "'There needs to be a health warning': How crypto trading can lead to addiction - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIn the circle of a therapy session in an 18th century Scottish country house are half-a-dozen recovering addicts. Many recall, at their lowest points, battling chronic depression and contemplating suicide.\n\nThe patients, all male, share harrowing stories of dealing with a newfangled addiction: compulsive crypto trading. Some say their crypto addiction combined with an alcohol or drug habit, while others say they began by treating trading digital tokens much like gambling.\n\n\u201cI spent eight hours a day on Reddit reading [crypto] white papers, thinking I\u2019m making an intellectual decision . . . it was just ridiculous,\u201d said one patient.\n\nTheir plight goes to the heart of a dilemma for politicians around the world as they try to grapple with the impact of cryptocurrencies on their populations. Many lawmakers and companies are calling for it to be designated as a financial service, which would demand tough regulatory standards but offer consumers legal protections.\n\nIn an effort to establish London as a \u201chub\u201d for financial markets innovation, the British government has set out a sweeping framework for crypto that would bring it into line with established regulations for financial services.\n\nBut in the UK last month a report from a powerful cross-party group of MPs said crypto should be regulated like gambling; people were trading assets that had \u201cno intrinsic value\u201d and \u201cno discernible social good\u201d, it said.\n\nFor those treating the 70-odd patients at the private Castle Craig rehab centre outside Edinburgh, the change in emphasis cannot come soon enough.\n\nCrypto addicts describe their experience \u201cas any gambler would describe their gambling addiction\u201d, said Anthony Marini, Castle Craig\u2019s senior specialist therapist. \u201cSo, for me, should it be regulated as gambling? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nMore than 300 patients suffering from a form of crypto addiction have come through Castle Craig\u2019s doors since it opened up to crypto traders in 2018, calling itself the world\u2019s first specialist crypto addiction centre.\n\nAll hands went up during the group session when Marini asked if any patients had experienced symptoms such as suicidal ideation, chronic depression or hopelessness.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a health warning [on crypto exchanges] just like any gambling site,\u201d Marini said. \u201cPeople have lost families, people have lost their jobs, people have embezzled . . . there needs to be warnings and education that this can actually kill people.\u201d\n\nCentral to the report from the Treasury select committee were concerns that handing oversight of crypto to the UK\u2019s main markets regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, would give the impression that crypto is \u201csafer than it is\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was seeing crypto more as an investment, so in my head I wasn\u2019t gambling at first . . . but I don\u2019t think it really works like that,\u201d another gambling addict told the Financial Times.\n\nDuring the therapy session at Castle Craig, patients described using crypto trading apps that were built to encourage them to invest compulsively and chase a quick profit, echoing the rougher tactics of the early online betting industry, which has been tamed to some extent by more fines being meted out by the Gambling Commission.\n\nGaming companies are now compelled to offer customers access to self-exclusion technology, while crypto trading apps are not. UK online betting platforms will soon have to impose stake limits and conduct basic affordability checks on users, although how this will work is still subject to consultation.\n\nThe prospect of regulations that borrow from the gambling playbook would likely \u201ccut against\u201d the UK government\u2019s ambitions to become a hub for the sector, argued Paige Berges, anti-corruption and international risk counsel at law firm Ropes & Gray.\n\nCrypto companies have also hit out at its findings, saying it underplays crypto\u2019s potential benefits for the economy and consumers. British lobbying group CryptoUK calls the select committee report \u201cnot helpful\u201d.\n\nTrading venue GFO-X said: \u201cAll investors \u2014 whether retail or institutional \u2014 deserve access to orderly markets which establish price discovery, in the same way as other financial instruments or commodities. The rhetoric around crypto assets being classed as gambling is extremely unhelpful and provides worse customer outcomes.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the UK Treasury, responsible for developing the rules, has privately indicated it will not be swayed by the report.\n\n\u201cRisks posed by crypto are typical of those that exist in traditional financial services and it is financial services regulation \u2014 rather than gambling regulation \u2014 that has the record in mitigating them,\u201d said a recent email from the Treasury to the crypto industry and seen by the FT.\n\nBut there is growing evidence that the lines between crypto trading and gambling are blurred, and the worst consequences of overuse look strikingly similar.\n\nA 2019 study from researchers at Rutgers University that looked at 876 gamblers who bet at least once a month found that increased problem gambling severity among the cohort was \u201cstrongly associated\u201d with trading crypto.\n\n\u201cYour emotions are so attached to what the graph is doing, especially with crypto because it\u2019s 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I\u2019d be checking my phone at 3am, you lose sleep over it,\u201d said one patient at Castle Craig.\n\nDuring the week when the Terra stablecoin collapsed last May, the US National Council on Problem Gambling registered a record 19,000 users, the same number as a typical month. A 2023 study by the Blockchain Research Lab found that crypto users who also gamble tend to be \u201cyoung, male, well-educated and well-off\u201d.\n\nThe NHS National Problem Gambling Clinic, which launched in 2008, will hold its first clinic solely focused on addicted retail traders this month, and half of the dozen patients complain of compulsively trading crypto.\n\n\u201cThe three impacts we see from gambling are on mental health, finances and on relationships. In crypto trading, what we\u2019re seeing is exactly the same,\u201d said Anna Hemmings, chief executive officer of gambling support organisation GamCare.\n\nBut putting crypto in one legal basket and not another also brings problems. Berges at Ropes & Gray points out that treating it as gaming could have the result of \u201cputting crypto outside the scope of traditional financial services regulations\u201d.\n\nKahlil Philander, assistant professor at Washington State University who researches the crossover of crypto and gambling, said not maintaining some oversight by the FCA would be a mistake as crypto is \u201cpretty clearly a commodity or a security\u201d.\n\nAnother is that the Gambling Commission, the body that would be charged with overseeing crypto, is less well-resourced than the FCA, which has more than 4,000 staff.\n\nFor years, safer gambling campaigners have complained that the Gambling Commission\u2019s \u00a374mn budget and 300 staff are toothless in the face of the \u00a314bn UK gambling industry.\n\n\u201cThe gambling sector is large and growing in this country . . . so I think in the short term it would be very challenging for the Gambling Commission to take on crypto,\u201d said Hemmings.\n\nBut the two regulators are conscious that technology is blurring the lines between them and have pledged to work together. That was prompted two years ago by the failure of Football Index, an online betting company that styled itself as a stock market for football. It fell into administration, leaving thousands of customers unable to access their funds.\n\nThe Football Index collapse \u201ccould have been avoided not by the FCA replacing the Gambling Commission as the regulator, but by them working together\u201d, said Matt Zarb-Cousin, the director of Clean Up Gambling. \u201cThe same applies to crypto.\u201d\n\nBut for many addicts the regulatory turf war is a moot point and too late. As one patient at Castle Craig said: \u201cPut gambling and crypto side by side, look at the repercussions of both of them, look at the severity of both of them, and tell me they\u2019re not the same.\u201d"
