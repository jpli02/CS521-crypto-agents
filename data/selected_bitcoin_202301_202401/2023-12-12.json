        "content": "Bitcoin traded near $42,000 after a turbulent stretch that lopped almost 8% from the largest digital asset and stirred predictions of more volatility heading into year-end.\n\nThe token posted the drop from Saturday through Monday, the worst three-day performance since mid-August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The retreat from almost $45,000 dragged down wider crypto markets too."

Indeed, a mere electronic accounting entry like a bitcoin is utterly unlike a gold coin \u2014 the gold coin being a notable piece of physical reality, not dependent on anybody\u2019s accounting system to exist. Yet at the top of your page one of December 5, illustrating your story, \u201cBets on cuts boost bitcoin\u201d, you misleadingly depict bitcoin precisely as a large gold coin stamped with a \u201cB.\u201d This silly illustration promotes the fallacy that bitcoin is like a gold coin and flatly contradicts the sound and sensible statements of your editorial.\n\nI suggest that FT policy should eliminate depicting bitcoin as a gold coin. Of course, it is difficult to illustrate bitcoin as the mere electronic accounting entry it is, but you should try to reflect the reality.\n\nAlex J Pollock\n\nSenior Fellow, Mises Institute, Lake Forest, IL, US"

        "content": "BlackRock Amends Bitcoin ETF Application, Easing Access for Wall Street Banks\n\nBlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has made revisions to its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application in a move aimed at facilitating the participation of Wall Street banks. The revised application allows banking giants like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to create new shares in the fund using cash instead of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis new redemption model, called \"prepay,\" enables authorized participants (APs) from major banks to bypass restrictions that prevent them from holding Bitcoin or crypto directly on their balance sheets. By transferring cash to a broker-dealer, which then converts it into Bitcoin, the APs can participate in the fund. Coinbase Custody serves as the ETF's custody provider in BlackRock's case.\n\nPresented to the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) by six BlackRock members and three from NASDAQ in a meeting on November 28, the revised model aims to address concerns such as market manipulation and enhance investor protections. BlackRock believes that the new structure offers superior resistance to market manipulation, a key factor that has previously led the SEC to reject spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nBlackRock recently had its third meeting with the SEC on December 11, led by Chairman Gary Gensler. The previous meeting on November 28 was a follow-up to the initial meeting on November 20, during which the original in-kind redemption model was presented.\n\nThe SEC is expected to make a decision on BlackRock's application by January 15, 2024.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Fairlead Strategies: Bitcoin has bullish outlook despite pullback - CNBC",
        "content": "Things are still looking up for bitcoin despite an eye-popping drop in its price at the beginning of this week, according to Fairlead Strategies. Bitcoin fell 7% Monday as traders took profits from a two-month rally now at 54%, according to Coin Metrics. The selling took place days after bitcoin surpassed the $40,000 level, rising above $44,000 quickly for the first time since April 2022. On Tuesday, it was trading at about $41,000. That could just be a blip in the chart, however. \"It has yet to impact our short-term trend-following gauges, which point higher,\" Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder and managing partner, said in a chart update Tuesday. She also said momentum in the intermediate term remains \"strongly positive,\" which suggests overbought conditions \"can be sustained without a major pullback in the weeks ahead.\" The drop began Sunday evening and at its lowest, pulled bitcoin down to $40,300, according to Coinbase. It'd have to fall even further, however, to warrant more concern by investors. Stockton said she's watching bitcoin's 50-day moving average, roughly $37,400, as the initial support level. Other chart analysts put it at $38,000 . The next level down is near $31,000, but Stockton said that's \"unlikely to be relevant near term.\" When prices reach new highs, Fairlead typically looks for them to sustain the new level for two weeks. The firm is looking to see if bitcoin can close this Sunday above $42,200 to confirm its recent breakout. That would make the next level higher to watch at about $48,600, which would be a 61.8% retracement, Stockton said in the note. Fairlead currently has a long-term neutral outlook on bitcoin. If the crypto can clear $42,700 for the month, that would support a shift to a long-term bullish bias, Stockton said. The key drivers that have been pushing crypto prices higher since the summer are still in place: primarily, the highly anticipated bitcoin exchange-traded fund, as well as the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected in the spring. Bitcoin may be the blue chip coin of the crypto market, but it's still a high risk bet compared to more traditional assets. Volatility is a key characteristic of the asset class, and pullbacks of as much as 10% are somewhat expected among more seasoned investors when bitcoin has big rallies. Bitcoin is currently up 9% in December, not a particularly strong month for bitcoin historically. It has gained 150% in 2023."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slid back below $41,000 this week after advancing as much as 12% in December amid optimism that the SEC will approve its first spot bitcoin ETF early next year.\n\nAnd the rally has room to run, according to Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) CEO Greg Beard, who expects \u201ctens of billions of dollars of additional demand.\"\n\nBeard added: \"We're still in the early days of bitcoin adoption and so I'm quite bullish on what could happen to pricing when that manifests itself in the marketplace.'\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Bitcoin bulls were enjoying a nice ride last week. As of last Friday, 2023 was Bitcoin's best year since 2020 in terms of percentage gains, but we did see a bit of a reversal. Bitcoin erasing its week long rally after one of the worst crypto selloffs that we've seen this year. So with all this volatility in the crypto market, where are prices headed next? We want to bring in Greg Beard. He's Stronghold Digital Mining's CEO. Greg, it's great to see you.\n\nSo I think there's a lot of talk just about in terms of the pricing action that we've seen with Bitcoin, a number of headlines that have been driving some of this optimism as we look ahead to 2024. What do you think is the biggest driver of Bitcoin here over the next several months?\n\nGREG BEARD: Yeah. Everyone's been paying attention to the prospect of ETFs being approved by the SEC and the prospective demand that will be brought to the Bitcoin market with those ETFs hitting the street, which if Bitcoin trades about $20 billion a day worth of coins in ETFs themselves, could be tens of billions of dollars of additional demand. So I think that's the reason for the recent run-up in Bitcoin in our view.\n\n- Is the potential for ETF approvals even bigger than the halving that is set to come forward or anticipated next year?\n\nGREG BEARD: Yeah. So there's a lot talk about what the halving would do. And the halving really just reduces the amount of the mining reward for the Bitcoin miners that approve transactions on the network. And looking backward, that has been a big impetus for Bitcoin price to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut as Bitcoin has gotten bigger over time, the mining rewards are less important. So I think I might have the minority view that the halving will have a big immediate impact on price. I think it's a much bigger impact on the demand from protective of ETF acceptance or from broader market use and acceptance as Bitcoin becomes more prevalent.\n\n- So Greg, when you talk about maybe broader use and acceptance, you talk about the fact that there is so much optimism surrounding the ETF approvals. How much of that optimism has already been priced in though when you take a look at the massive run-up that we have seen in Bitcoin?\n\nGREG BEARD: Yeah. I think certainly, some will be priced in. But those ETFs actually have to go out and buy the bitcoins. And so I think the demand, the prospect for demand might be in the market a bit. But keep in mind, they actually have to go do it. And they can't do it until they're approved and created."
