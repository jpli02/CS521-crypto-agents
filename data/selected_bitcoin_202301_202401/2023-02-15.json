        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nBitcoin bolted past $24,000 for the first time in two weeks after surging more than 8% over the past 24 hours, likely the result of the type of short squeeze that historically has sent prices higher. The percentage increase was the largest since BTC jumped 10.5% on Sept. 9.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had dropped below $21,600 at different points in recent days amid growing investor fretfulness about crypto regulation, particularly targeting the stablecoin market, and about future U.S. central bank steps to tame inflation.\n\nBut those concerns seemed to fade quickly as bitcoin surged past $24,100 by the afternoon before retreating slightly.\n\nData from crypto data provider Coinglass showed that traders who bet on price shifts liquidated some $65 million of bitcoin over the past 24 hours, from which about $60 million were in short positions.\n\nCrypto-related stocks also jumped, with both exchange Coinbase (COIN) and bitcoin miner \u200b\u200bMarathon Digital Holdings (MARA) increasing 15%. Business software company MicroStrategy (MSTR), a major BTC holder, recently rose more than 9%.\n\nEther (ETH) was up 5.5% to recently trade at $1,645. The CoinDesk Market Index spiked 4% for the day.\n\nLucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, said that investors also found reason for optimism in Tuesday's tepid U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed inflation declining slightly to 6.4% on an annual basis even as it failed to meet analysts expectations. \"Since the market reaction to the CPI print was positive even if it was higher than expected, I believe this was seen as a sign of strength for the rally to continue in risk assets altogether,\" Outumuro told CoinDesk.\n\nRiyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, also said that markets also may have already accounted for concerns about increased regulation tied to stablecoins, including Binance's BUSD token.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Crypto has had some added catalysts with the BUSD news, which has largely been absorbed and I think today was a reflection of some of the regulatory fears \u2013 and immediate fears around BUSD \u2013 easing,\" Carey told CoinDesk.\n\nUPDATE (Feb. 15, 2023, 20:41 UTC): Updates headline and adds historical context to the size of bitcoin's 24-hour increase.\n\nUPDATE (Feb. 15, 2023, 20:56 UTC): Updates to reflect latest liquidation of BTC short and other positions.\n\nUPDATE (Feb. 15, 2023, 21:05 UTC): Updates price chart.\n\nUPDATE (Feb. 15, 2023, 22:39 UTC): Adds analysts comments."

        "content": "Last year, bitcoin moved in tandem with the stock market as well as the bond market as inflation applied downward pressure to most assets. In the recent rally, bitcoin is doing the same, tailing indexes like the Nasdaq 100 as it moves higher amid the anticipation of fewer rate hikes.\n\nThat remains to be seen, however, as the U.S. Federal Reserve could reverse course if it senses that it doesn't quite have inflation under control. If that's the case, more volatility could be ahead for the stock market, which could translate to volatility in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\"On days when technology stocks trade higher, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), are likely to do the same,\" a Coindesk article noted. \"Conversely, a decline in technology stocks could drag the crypto market lower.\"\n\nThat said, macroeconomic catalysts like inflation reports and interest rate decisions are likely to move cryptocurrencies again this year. A peek at the Nasdaq 100 may offer market-watchers an idea of what the cryptocurrency market might be doing.\n\n\"The renewed positive correlation implies increased sensitivity of cryptocurrencies to macroeconomic data releases like the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), which injects volatility into stock markets,\" the article added further. \"The CPI days were among the most volatile for U.S. stocks last year, according to MarketWatch.\"\n\nGet Bitcoin Exposure on a Regulated Exchange\n\nGetting bitcoin exposure doesn't mean that investors must trade digital currencies by opening a separate account on an unregulated cryptocurrency exchange that could potentially open them up to potential risk. That said, investors have options in regulated markets in order to get cryptocurrency exposure to major coins like bitcoin.\n\nExchange traded funds (ETFs) can allow investors to get in on thebitcoin priceaction without investing directly in the digital currency itself. Consider the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nFor the bulls, BITO builds capital appreciation through its bitcoin futures contract use, allowing investors to get exposure tobitcoin priceappreciation within the regulatory framework of a traditional financial exchange. For the bears, BITI seeks daily investment results equal to the inverse (-1x) of the daily performance of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Index, allowing traders to profit off price declines in bitcoin.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Xverse, billed as a \u201cBitcoin wallet for Web3,\u201d just rolled out support for Ordinals, the newly popularized protocol allowing users to inscribe NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019ve launched first class support for Ordinals,\u201d tweeted the wallet team on Wednesday. The company explained that inscribing NFTs through its software involves \u201cno need to run a node, complex software, or anything else,\u201d merely some Bitcoin to pay a transaction fee, which can be bought directly through the app.\n\nInscriptions are made via Gamma.io, a Bitcoin NFT marketplace that rolled out \u201cno-code ordinal inscriptions\u201d last week. According to Xverse, roughly 5% of Bitcoin inscriptions so far have been made using Gamma\u2019s tool.\n\nAfter uploading an image and sending a transaction to their provided Ordinals address, users can find their inscriptions inside their Xverse NFT collection within 20 to 30 minutes\u2014and embedded in the blockchain forever.\n\nOver 100K Ordinals Minted on Bitcoin, Bringing Cheers and Network Congestion\n\nThis comes just a day after Hiro, another Bitcoin focused Web3 wallet, rolled out inscriptions to its testnet on Tuesday. Both wallets interact with Stacks, a \u201clayer 1.5\u201d blockchain with its own NFT economy that settles its transactions on Bitcoin.\n\nXverse, too, lets Bitcoin users interact with Stacks, with plans to introduce instant payments via the lightning network.\n\nBitcoin recently logged its 100,000th Ordinals transaction, continuing a trend of exponential growth. Given that NFTs on Bitcoin were not a feature envisioned by its original developers, their existence has naturally sparked controversy, with many people unsure of whether they will hurt or help the network.\n\nStacks co-creator Muneeb Ali said he welcomes the new protocol, stating that it marks a \u201cnew chapter in Bitcoin history\u201d on Tuesday. The following day, he said that Xverse\u2019s Bitcoin wallet now has the \u201ceasiest on-ramp to ordinals.\u201d\n\nKen Liao, the founder and CEO of Xverse wallet (aka Secret Key Labs), said that the ability to send out one\u2019s ordinal from the wallet will be available soon. Liao was formerly an engineering parter at Stacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts out!

        "title": "'Bitcoin Is the Best Brand in Crypto': Why DeGods NFTs Are Now on Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs via Ordinals are the buzziest thing in the space lately, with more than 100,000 such media assets committed to the blockchain in barely two weeks. Surprisingly, that tally includes 535 NFTs from DeGods\u2014the most valuable Solana NFT project.\n\nDeGods revealed the move on Monday as word circulated that the profile pictures (PFPs) had all been inscribed on Bitcoin in a single block. (\"Inscribing\" is the process by which NFT-like assets are created on the Bitcoin blockchain, akin to \"minting\" on Ethereum.) The 535 particular images were originally released via Solana in 2021, but were \u201cburned\u201d (or permanently destroyed) to cut down the supply in the early days of the project.\n\nProject creator Rohun Vora, who goes by the pseudonym Frank, told Decrypt that he and Dust Labs CEO Kevin Henrikson (who simply goes by Kevin) are longtime Bitcoin aficionados who relished the opportunity to bring the project onto the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s network in the early days of Ordinals momentum.\n\nAesthetics matter a lot to my team @DeGodsNFT. It was an honor working with @hash_bender to make sure there was no random trashy Ordinals minted in between all 535 DeGods. All in one block. Simple. Beautiful. Inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain forever. pic.twitter.com/Yfuvc8IDuT \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) February 14, 2023\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the best brand in crypto\u2014just as pristine as it gets,\u201d Frank told Decrypt. \u201cIt's the most well known, and truly as simple but powerful as it can get. And the mission statement is it's never been corrupted, right? It's like global sound money. That is so powerful. Aligning ourselves with the best brand in crypto is a no-brainer at any given point in time.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNow those 535 PFPs have gained a second life on Bitcoin with never-before-seen upgraded artwork. DeGods previously provided holders refreshed \u201cDeadGods\u201d artwork last year, and created upgraded artwork for the burned NFTs as well, plotting an eventual revival.\n\nNFT Sales Jump 38% in January as Bored Apes Drive Trading Surge\n\n\u201cWe always had this notion of \u2018What is dead may never die,\u2019\u201d Kevin explained, echoing the familiar refrain from the HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\" \u201cAnd it was this idea, like: Holy shit, this is so perfect. We can literally bring these back, mint them as Ordinals on BTC, and it's permanent,\u201d he said.\n\nBack to life\n\nOrdinals is a unique way of inscribing NFT-like media and assets to the Bitcoin blockchain by connecting them with a single Satoshi, or 1/100,000,000th of one BTC. The media is fully stored on-chain and the Ordinal can be transferred, although there\u2019s still a need for a lot more infrastructure and platforms for transacting and handling the assets.\n\nIt has quickly given rise to CryptoPunks clones and playable web games on Bitcoin. OnChain Monkey, an Ethereum project, also put its entire 10,000 NFT original collection into a single inscription. However, Ordinals has also drawn considerable backlash from Bitcoin maximalists, plus it has boosted network congestion\u2014and transaction fees in tandem.\n\nOver 100K Ordinals Minted on Bitcoin, Bringing Cheers and Network Congestion\n\nKevin said that they dove into Ordinals as soon as it started gaining steam. But with the DeGods inscriptions, they didn\u2019t just want to mint them in the typical way and have the inscriptions added to the network across potentially multiple Bitcoin blocks.\n\nInstead, they worked with a Bitcoin miner, Luxor Technologies CEO Nick Hansen, to arrange for all 535 of the NFT inscriptions to be etched onto the blockchain in a single, exclusive block. The block was processed by DMG Blockchain Solutions\u2019 Terra Pool, which claims to be a carbon-neutral mining pool powered by renewable energy solutions.\n\nOver 1 year ago, 535 DeGods were burned. Many have speculated on their return. What is dead may never die. pic.twitter.com/fmP1FhZI6F \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) February 13, 2023\n\n\u201cIt was a deal-breaker for us if we couldn't do it as a custom block, because we had to do something special,\u201d Frank told Decrypt. \u201cIt\u2019s the DeGods way, right? You can't just do it in the basic way. You\u2019ve gotta do something that feels really fresh.\u201d\n\nUltimately, to fit the 535 images into a single Bitcoin block, they had to be seriously compressed. Each was resized down to a low-resolution 210x210 pixels\u2014a nod to the total Bitcoin supply of 21 million BTC\u2014and in the .webp file format to conserve space. But now they\u2019re all inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain for future use.\n\nWhile many NFTs on Ethereum and other platforms store their artwork externally on either centralized servers or decentralized storage solutions (like IPFS), Ordinals fit the artwork or asset entirely within the on-chain block. That proved to be a key part of the appeal for the DeGods team\u2014that these assets will live potentially forever on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI've run a [Bitcoin] node, and the idea that every single node on the planet is now verifying and backing up this image is so powerful,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThat is what got us really excited.\u201d\n\nNext steps\n\nMeanwhile, the broader DeGods project is already set to be bridged from Solana to Ethereum sometime this quarter, as announced in December\u2014with sister project y00ts bridging from Solana to Polygon.\n\nThat\u2019s still happening for the rest of the project\u2019s 10,000 total NFTs, and Frank tweeted this week that \u201chaving a presence on all blockchains is important.\u201d However, these 535 specific DeGods NFTs, which were previously burned on Solana, will only live on Bitcoin via Ordinals.\n\nHow they roll out remains to be seen, however. The official DeGods account tweeted Monday that details on how to mint the Bitcoin NFTs will be announced \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Kevin told Decrypt that they\u2019re currently being held in private wallets, and that they\u2019re waiting for more tooling to be deployed to make Ordinals safer to handle and transact. Once that target is hit, Kevin said that they have plenty of ideas on how to launch the NFTs in an effort to \u201ccome back to our holders and support the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're gonna essentially sit on them,\u201d Kevin said, \u201cuntil we are comfortable that the tooling will support the proper custody of these for a reasonably sophisticated crypto connoisseur.\u201d"
