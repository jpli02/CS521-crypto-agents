        "content": "$1.4B Inflows Into Spot Bitcoin ETF After First Two Trading Sessions\n\nSpot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which launched last Thursday, have already attracted a significant amount of investor interest in their first two days, with total inflows reaching $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nThe funds experienced a total of 500,000 trades, racking up trading volumes of around $3.6 billion. However, Balchunas noted that these numbers may be adjusted due to transactions awaiting accounting settlement. Grayscale's ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), experienced an outflow of $579 million during the period. After deducting the GBTC outflows, the net total inflows across all spot Bitcoin ETFs stood at $819 million.\n\nThe outflows from GBTC could be attributed to holders converting their shares following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of the ETF through a ruling change. Some GBTC holders are reportedly switching to lower-fee options from other fund managers. Grayscale is charging 1.50% while other asset managers like BlackRock are charging 0.25%. GBTC is one of the largest holders of Bitcoin, managing over $27 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. Shares of GBTC have been traded since 2013 but were not redeemable for Bitcoin until January 11.\n\nAmong the spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust topped the performance with $497.7 million total flows, followed by Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF with $422.3 million and Bitwise with $237.9 million.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Bitcoin tumbled after ETFs launched. What it means for crypto miners - CNBC",
        "content": "Investors in bitcoin mining stocks are closely watching the price of the cryptocurrency after the Securities and Exchange Commission's move to allow spot bitcoin ETFs became a sell-the-news event. After the ETFs received regulatory approval last week, the flagship currency briefly touched $49,000. As the week went on, however, bitcoin wiped out its earlier gains and notched a modest weekly loss of 0.01%. Crypto mining companies are now feeling the squeeze in this latest bitcoin sell-off \u2013 and that's evident in the big week-to-date declines for Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms , both of which lost more than 20%. First, the hash rate \u2013 the amount of computing power the Bitcoin network uses to process transactions \u2013 has been hitting all-time highs almost every week and hurting miners' margins, according to Reginald Smith, analyst at JPMorgan. The network hash rate has increased more than 30% over the last four months, he said, rising alongside bitcoin's 157% ascent in 2023. Second, investors are watching bitcoin's price in the wake of the ETFs' debut because if the crypto doesn't rise to a range of $50,000 and $55,000 soon, smaller miners may not have sufficient capital to grow and may have difficulty maintaining their operations. \"Miners who are at the lower end of the cost curve with limited amounts of debt and plenty of liquidity between bitcoin and cash on their balance sheets are going to be ones that fare the best in 2024,\" said Chase White, an analyst at Compass White. \"But it could be a hard time in the middle of the year as miners play the prisoner's dilemma game of who needs to turn off their machines and who doesn't.\" \"The older, less efficient miners are way less profitable, but they're still just profitable enough to stay online, hurting everybody's margin,\" he said. \"If [the bitcoin price] gets to $45,000 or below only the newest, most efficient miners with the \u2026 lowest cost power are going to be able to stay online.\" A dynamic in focus This dynamic between the bitcoin price and the mining companies is coming into focus in anticipation of the Bitcoin halving, when the reward for mining the flagship crypto is cut in half, as designed in the Bitcoin code, to reduce its supply. Because of the supply cut, the halving historically sets the stage for big price rallies in the following six to nine months. However, the reduction in the reward also means miners' revenue takes a hit. Overall, analysts are fairly optimistic that bitcoin will rise as expected due to three key catalysts: the ETF, the halving and potential interest rate cuts. \"The catalyst of the ETF and, a little bit later in the year, the potential for rate cuts, could lead bitcoin to run a lot faster than the global hash rate can run, which could alleviate a lot of this problem,\" White said. \"But it needs to rise above $50,000 for that to be the case, and we think we can get there.\" Compass White's year-end price target right now for bitcoin is $75,000. White said private miners will likely struggle the most because it's harder for them to access capital than the publicly traded miners, which can sell stock in at-the-market programs. He named Riot Platforms, Iris Energy , Cipher Mining and Bitfarms as some of his picks. JPMorgan's top pick is Iris Energy. The firm is neutral on Cipher, CleanSpark and Riot, although Smith said he's incrementally constructive on Riot, which is more actively traded and he sees as a long-term winner. Last week, Iris Energy and Cipher dropped more than 16% each. In a note earlier in the week, Smith suggested there may be weakness after the ETF approval \u2013 likely driven by technical selling pressure, rather than fundamental miner economics, since institutional investors now have other ways to express a view on bitcoin with the introduction of ETFs. \"We would view any sell-off [in mining stocks] as a buying opportunity, as the ETF does not directly impact mining economics or change competitive dynamics, and we remain bullish on bitcoin and bitcoin miners in 2024,\" he wrote."

        "content": "Hong Kong should soon follow the United States' lead in authorising spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bolstering the city's ambition to become a major virtual-asset hub in Asia, according to industry insiders.\n\nWhile the city's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in December said it was prepared to authorise retail access to spot virtual asset ETFs, the actual launch of such products has already fallen behind the US, according to Wang Yi, the head of quantitative investment at CSOP Asset Management, which currently runs two cryptocurrency futures ETFs.\n\nUS-listed spot bitcoin ETFs saw US$4.6 billion worth of shares trade hands on Thursday, according to a Reuters report that cited LSEG data, as investors jumped into the landmark products approved by the US securities regulator on Wednesday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nThe successful US launch of spot bitcoin ETFs is expected to help move Hong Kong regulators closer to authorising similar cryptocurrency funds to operate in the city.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpot cryptocurrency ETFs enable investors to gain exposure to virtual assets without directly buying any crypto tokens.\n\nThese funds \"give the crypto industry more legitimacy and also opens up more collaboration opportunities with mainstream finance\", said RJ Ke, a researcher with ethereum scaling start-up Taiko. \"Hong Kong is likely to accelerate bitcoin ETF applications in the coming months.\"\n\nAround 10 fund management firms are preparing to launch spot virtual asset-backed ETFs in Hong Kong, according to Chinese media Caixin's interview on Wednesday of Livio Weng, chief operating officer at crypto trading app operator HashKey Group. Weng said that up to eight companies were at an \"advanced stage\" to launch.\n\nBitcoin jumped about 3.4 per cent to US$47,500, following the spot crypto ETF approvals in the US. That was nearly three times the level that the original cryptocurrency reached in November 2022, when failed crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy to send bitcoin's price below US$17,000.\n\nHong Kong needs to launch spot virtual asset ETFs as soon as possible to \"ensure that the city remains competitive in the global cryptocurrency market and strengthen its position as a global financial centre\", said Mao Shixing, also known as \"Discus Fish\", who is the co-founder and chief executive of digital asset custody solutions provider Cobo.\n\nMao said the US approvals could impact other jurisdictions because \"the SEC is one of the most influential and reputable financial regulators in the world\", adding that the agency's initiatives \"often serve as important references for financial regulators in other countries and regions\".\n\n\"However, each country and region has its own independent stance and regulatory objectives,\" he said.\n\nEchoing the Cobo head's view, Donald Day, chief operating officer at digital asset platform VDX, said the SEC's decision would make its peers \"seriously consider whether similar ETFs would be permissible and desirable\".\n\nDay pointed out that the SFC's statement in December about being prepared to authorise such funds has \"in principle opened a pathway for issuers to launch spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong\".\n\nWith the US, there are now nine markets around the world that have allowed the operation of spot crypto ETFs. The other markets include Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and tax havens such as the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean and Jersey near the coast of northwestern France, according to market analytics firm CoinGecko.\n\nMainland China, however, is unlikely to follow suit.\n\nIn December, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it will draft a national Web3 development plan to suit the country's needs. But the announcement did not mention cryptocurrencies even though Beijing maintains its support for Hong Kong's ambition to become a major virtual-asset hub.\n\nThe Chinese government banned banks from handling bitcoin in 2013 and forced cryptocurrency exchanges to move offshore in 2017. In 2021, the country's regulators reiterated the state's prohibition on all financial institutions from engaging in crypto-related activities.\n\nChina's state media recently emphasised the risks involved in spot cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nThe US approval of spot bitcoin ETFs \"would make the cryptocurrency market even more frantic, providing fertile ground for illegal transactions such as money laundering\", according to a report by the International Financial News, a newspaper under the People's Daily, which cited Shanghai Jiao Tong University assistant professor Li Nan.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.
