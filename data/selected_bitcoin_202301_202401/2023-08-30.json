        "content": "Iceland has become a refuge for Bitcoin miners as energy costs soar and regulatory pressure on cryptocurrency operations mount in the US and other countries.\n\nThe volcanic island runs almost entirely on hydroelectric and geothermal power that it historically creates a surplus of. And miners have tapped that power for their energy-intensive computers. Not only does Iceland have an abundance of renewable energy but its cool climate is attractive to overworked data centers."

        "content": "Today, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC to 75% by the end of this year, and 95% by the end of 2024.\n\n\"The chances of the SEC approving spot Bitcoin ETFs this year have risen from 75% from 65% following Grayscale's court win, we believe, while the odds by the end of 2024 reach 95%,\" said the analysts. \"The judges unanimously repudiated the SECs arguments, and the agency will struggle to justify further denials as it faces deadlines, negative PR and HashDex's novel approach.\"\n\nYesterday, the DC Circuit court of appeals vacated the SEC's denial of Grayscale's $GBTC conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. While this did not result in GBTC automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, this victory was a big step towards the approval of one in the future.\n\n\"The appeals court found the SEC to be arbitrary and capricious in its denial oder of GBTC's conversion into an ETF and vacated the decision,\" the analysts continued. \"The written opinion from Judge Neomi Rao repudiated virtually every argument made by the SEC when comparing the Bitcoin spot and futures markets.\"\n\nA SEC decision on multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs is due by the end of this week, with many believing the applications will be further delayed as these so close to the Grayscale court outcome that just happened. Although, Balchunas said he's \"not sure timelines will matter as much in this situation,\" and that what is more likely is that eventually the SEC will give in and approve an imminent launch.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Grayscale bitcoin ETF may be giving bulls 'too much hopium': Strategist - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A federal appeals court handed Grayscale a monumental victory in its path to converting its bitcoin trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin ETF. Crypto traders are doubling down on bullish sentiments as this decision could change the tide for broadened crypto asset exposures in the future.\n\nSwan Bitcoin Managing Director Terrence Yang joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the volatility to come in the crypto market.\n\n\"Too many bulls... that think the ETF will be approved ASAP or in the next several weeks,\" Yang says. \"I'm not sure we are going to see a launch of any bitcoin, I don't think we'll see we will be a launch of any spot bitcoin ETF before year-end and I'm happy to bet people on this, I've been... goading some of the hopium bros on Twitter to bet against me.\"\n\nYang also comments on the potential for bitcoin price manipulation and how Wall Street firms like BlackRock (BLK) may adopt bitcoin ETF investments.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- So what do you think that then means for the price of crypto, the price of Bitcoin then, at least in the near term. Certainly sounds like we could see a lot of volatility if that is, in fact, the case.\n\nTERRENCE YANG: It, there will be some volatility as the market digests, and I believe comes around to my view that short term, there's too much hopium, there's too many crypto bulls and Bitcoin bulls who think that the ETF will be approved ASAP or in the next several weeks. I'm not sure we're going to see a launch of any Bitcoin. I don't think we'll see a launch of any spot Bitcoin ETF before year end. And I'm happy to bet people on this, I've made been goading some of the hopium bros on Twitter to bet against me.\n\n- Even with the cleanup that's happening within the space, you said that there's still a lot of price manipulation that's happening specifically on Bitcoin. We're seeing it trading above that $27,000 handle. What is the real value, you think, if the manipulation is still happening.\n\nTERRENCE YANG: So I think Bitcoin, the real value, is it's way undervalued. This is the best asymmetric upside, asset with asymmetric upside I've ever seen in my life, and I've been in finance many years. [CHUCKLES] But short term, who knows, because until the wash trading price manipulation and fraud is completely cleaned up.\n\nStory continues\n\nI do feel like if you look at the trading volumes they've gone down in Bitcoin, maybe because of US and Chinese authorities going after some of these Chinese exchanges like Binance, like Kobe, and the threat of that has made them not want to be as aggressive, I think, in their wash trading. So maybe the current volume is about right when you strip out the bump up in trading volume due to this recent Grayscale decision. But for some time, we've been seeing a pretty significant decline in trading volume.\n\n- Terrence, interest that we've seen from BlackRock, from Fidelity, just to name a few on the spot Bitcoin ETF here potentially for the future, how big of a catalyst is that going to be just in terms of wider adoption and getting more people to eventually potentially trust Bitcoin.\n\nTERRENCE YANG: Sure. Once they launch, especially those two plus Invesco which is the manager for QQQ, the very popular tech ETF, once those three launch, or any of those three launch, it will be a massive bullish sign where a flood of money should come into Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhy? Because those three are three of the most respected traditional finance or tradfi companies in the world. They really know ETFs, they really know finance, they're respected by institutions, and high net worth and other folks as well. So once they are actually launching and offering Bitcoin ETFs, I think a flood of cash will come in.\n\nVery different from gold ETFs. Why? Because gold was around for thousands of years, accepted across all cultures as valuable. By the time the gold ETF came about it was like OK, this is great. There was a flood of cash that rushed into gold, gold because of gold ETFs, but I think with Bitcoin it's going to be like 10x bigger if not much more.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is a teenager, it's considered a scam by some of the people I respect the most in my life, family members, extremely accomplished law school classmates, they don't get Bitcoin, and I think that's going to change within about a year."

        "title": "Little evidence that a spot bitcoin ETF would expand the market - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nYou don\u2019t have to want to invest in bitcoin to be in favour of US regulators giving their approval to a bitcoin exchange traded fund. You can disapprove of other people putting their money into the cryptocurrency but defend the idea that the Securities and Exchange Commission should let them. Perhaps not to the death \u2014 we don\u2019t need to go all Voltaire about this \u2014 but you get the idea.\n\nApplications for a spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 a fund that would actually hold bitcoin directly as opposed to investing in derivatives tied to the bitcoin price \u2014 have been consistently rejected by the SEC over the past decade.\n\nBut a court ruling this week looks to have changed the picture. A judge ruled that the regulator acted capriciously in denying the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s request to convert to an ETF, given futures-based bitcoin funds are already available.\n\nThe ruling added to excitement about spot bitcoin ETFs that has been building since June when BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, put in its own application to launch one. Surely, crypto enthusiasts reasoned, well-connected BlackRock would not be making such a request unless it knew the regulator was thawing its position?\n\nThere were specific reasons to think BlackRock will be able to break the logjam. Its application included a plan for a \u201csurveillance-sharing\u201d arrangement with a crypto exchange, to deal with the SEC\u2019s concern that nefarious traders could manipulate the market to the disadvantage of the ETF\u2019s investors. Other asset managers, including Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark, have amended their pending bitcoin ETF applications to copy the BlackRock plan.\n\nThe bitcoin price shot up 20 per cent in a week after the BlackRock news in June, and was up 7 per cent on Tuesday\u2019s court victory by Grayscale, as traders bet the launch of an ETF will tempt in a rash of new buyers.\n\nPersonally, I am tiring of the 15-year quest to find a use for the bitcoin blockchain beyond self-reflexive speculation on the price of bitcoin itself. It has been sad to watch a generation of young people lured into cryptocurrency trading instead of learning the long-term investment techniques that build wealth. It\u2019s been enraging to watch the explosion of get-rich-quick products labelled \u201cdecentralised finance\u201d when so many are just Ponzi schemes hiding in plain sight. To see some of the more egregious purveyors of this financial snake oil being hauled before the courts has been pleasing but it\u2019s surprising, frankly, to see the \u201cvalue\u201d of bitcoin and all the other cryptocurrencies remain above $1tn despite the cascading failures of the past year.\n\nBut who am I to disagree with BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink\u2019s view \u2014 recently acquired \u2014 that bitcoin is an \u201cinternational asset\u201d for investors to \u201cplay\u201d as an alternative to gold or currencies such as the euro or sterling? His group\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF will probably have lower fees than the current futures-based funds in the US, and provide a better guarantee of doing what it says on the tin \u2014 tracking the price of bitcoin \u2014 than alternatives such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust which, as currently structured, has swung as far as 50 per cent in either direction from its net asset value. For people who feel they must \u201cplay\u201d, spot bitcoin ETFs will be safer, cheaper, simpler products, and the benefits of protecting people who have already been lured in to cryptocurrency outweigh the risk of luring in more.\n\nTraders already have a cornucopia of crypto vehicles to pick from on US exchanges, from \u201c2x leveraged\u201d bitcoin funds using derivatives to stock funds stuffed with highly speculative companies that have cryptocurrency or blockchain investments of their own. By comparison, a spot bitcoin fund looks positively vanilla.\n\nMore generally, ETFs are home to a dazzling array of bad investment ideas, even more so now that actively managed funds are crowding in after the index trackers that established the product.\n\nI am tiring of the 15 year quest to find a use for the bitcoin blockchain beyond self-reflexive speculation on the price of bitcoin itself\n\nThe flipside is that fund managers have become more inclined to close funds when an investment fad fizzles, says Todd Rosenbluth of VettaFi, a research firm. Casualties in recent months have included the Punk Subversive Metaverse ETF and the AdvisorShares Drone Technology ETF. BlackRock has no Midas touch, either. Last year, it shut a number of ETFs under the iShares Evolved brand that promised to use machine learning and analysis of font sizes in financial documents to sort stocks into sectoral funds ranging from consumer discretionary to \u201cinnovative healthcare\u201d. They had failed to gather significant assets.\n\nThere is scant evidence that a spot bitcoin ETF will expand the market at this point. BlackRock will put its marketing muscle behind the product, but I doubt it will be taking out Super Bowl commercials. Crypto trading was long ago \u201cdemocratised\u201d by Coinbase and other exchanges and the demos has drifted off. Those betting the debut of a spot bitcoin ETF will usher in a new bull market are just as likely to find it opens up short-selling opportunities that hold the price down.\n\nJPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou predicts a BlackRock launch will do little more than draw liquidity away from other products, notably bitcoin futures, in a zero-sum game. Spot bitcoin funds have existed for some time outside the US but have failed to attract large investor interest, he pointed out in a research note.\n\nThe two-and-a-half-year-old Purpose Bitcoin ETF in Canada has just $600mn in assets, for example, and bitcoin funds globally have not had significant inflows since mid-2021. Spot bitcoin ETFs would be a perfectly inoffensive addition to the US market, though the SEC might find it is opening the stable door after the horse has died.\n\nStephen Foley is the FT\u2019s US accounting editor.
