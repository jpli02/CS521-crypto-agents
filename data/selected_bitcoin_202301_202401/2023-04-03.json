        "content": "Bitcoin behaved more like one of the world\u2019s most historic currencies in March, as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap exhibited a strong correlation to gold.\n\nThe value of the two assets moved in similar directions throughout the month, edging higher as a banking crisis reared its head in the U.S. and toppled several institutions like Silicon Valley Bank\u2014which eventually spilled over to shutter European giants like Credit Suisse.\n\nThe correlation between Bitcoin and gold currently stands around 50%, according to blockchain analytics firm Kaiko. It represents the strongest connection between the two assets in more than a year, Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cIt's a significant shift because over the course of 2022 Bitcoin and gold were mostly uncorrelated,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it was not moving as a safe haven [asset] at all.\u201d\n\nOver the past month, Bitcoin has rallied 25% to around $28,000, notching its third positive month in a row despite regulatory headwinds. Meanwhile, gold has risen over 8% during the past month, nearing an all-time high of`$1,988 per troy ounce on Monday.\n\nBitcoin Is Pumping\u2014But It\u2019s Not Yet 'Decoupling' From Stocks, Analysts Say\n\nCryptocurrencies aren\u2019t typically viewed as a safe haven asset\u2014they\u2019re generally seen as risky investments like stocks. And these risk assets have been hammered over the past year as the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates to quell inflation.\n\nBut Aubert said it\u2019s possible for Bitcoin\u2019s status as a risk asset to shift somewhat as investors\u2019 perceptions of its strengths as a store of value change.\n\n\u201cFor now, people are trying to put Bitcoin in a very traditional framework,\u201d Aubert said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard because it can be a lot of things.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500\u2014a major index often used to gauge movements in the U.S. stock market\u2014fell significantly in March to 20%, adding on to a trend that\u2019s been building for months, said Aubert.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s correlation with equities has been going down since December, steadily, and it's now very low,\u201d she said, adding that 20% is essentially negligible.\n\nHowever, Aubert said that Bitcoin will remain influenced by factors that also impact stocks, such as the Fed\u2019s monetary policy. She also noted that Bitcoin is sensitive to changes in liquidity overall.\n\nIs Bitcoin Really Decoupling From Stocks? Experts Weigh In\n\nAs Bitcoin begins to behave more like a safe haven asset and less like a risky one, there are some fundamental similarities between Bitcoin and gold that are notable, CoinShares\u2019 Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt.\n\nOne element that the two assets have in common is that a finite supply supports their value, he said. Similar to how there\u2019s a limited amount of accessible gold in the world, Bitcoin\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million\u2014with the last Bitcoin expected to be mined sometime in 2140, according to projections.\n\n\u201cBitcoin, in fact, is technically a harder asset than gold because it's a finite supply, but [also] a very well-known finite supply,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cTheoretically, you could go out into the universe and find a ton of gold, bring it back to Earth, and flood the market.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the cultural overlap between Bitcoin and gold, perhaps there is evidence to suggest they are converging on that front as well.\n\nThe California-based rapper Snoop Dogg stepped into the ring at WrestleMania 39 yesterday and was seen sporting a golden hardware wallet like an expensive chain."

        "content": "Company mines 598 bitcoin in the month; Ends the first quarter of the calendar year with 1,871 bitcoin mined, up 22% from the prior quarter; 50MW Washington expansion on schedule\n\nExpansion of CleanSpark's Washington, Georgia, Bitcoin Mining Campus is On Schedule\n\nImage of CleanSpark's bitcoin mining facility expansion, currently under construction, in Washington, GA.\n\nExpansion of CleanSpark's Washington, Georgia, Bitcoin Mining Campus is On Schedule\n\nImage of CleanSpark's bitcoin mining facility expansion, currently under construction, in Washington, GA.\n\nLAS VEGAS, April 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanSpark, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending March 31, 2023.\n\n\u201cOur approach to proprietary mining gives us substantial control and flexibility over our destiny and the progress on our Washington expansion is a perfect example,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO. \u201cThe 50MW expansion is on schedule. The machines have already been purchased and shipping is expected to commence this month. Once those machines are racked and the expansion is energized, our hashrate is expected to increase to about 8.7 EH/s, giving us substantial progress toward our calendar year-end goal of 16 EH/s.\n\n\u201cIn this environment, a miner that is not growing is falling behind. As hashrate grows, we also need to grow. Growth takes substantial capital, just as it does in any commodities-based business, especially in the scaling stage. As we scale, we intend to continue to use all capital levers available to us, including equity and bitcoin, carefully balancing both to provide the highest rate of return for our shareholders. We are making the most of the bear market so that we are in position to take full advantage of the next bull market once it inevitably emerges.\u201d\n\nMarch Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in March: 598\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 1,871\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of March 31: 196\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in March: 502\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 67,700 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.7 EH/s\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 502 bitcoins in March 2023 at an average of approximately $24,800 per BTC. Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $12.4 million. March daily BTC mined averaged 19.29 and reached a high of 20.25.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperational Update\n\nWashington Expansion. The Washington expansion is a passively cooled data center consisting of four primary buildings. Once fully complete, the expansion will hold about 15,000 Antminer S19j Pro+ machines. Total capacity in Washington is expected to be 86MW, the majority of which is sourced from low-carbon, on-grid energy. Building 1 is complete and ready for miners. Racks are currently being installed in Building 2. The foundation was recently poured for Building 3, while concrete deliveries are imminent for Building 4. Scott Garrison, vice president of business development, is leading the expansion.\n\n\u201cWe are on schedule in Washington,\u201d said Garrison. \u201cOne building is completely done and ready for miners, with the other buildings in various stages of construction, each advancing according to schedule. Our teams and partners, which include the utility, city, and various construction firms, are working hand-in-hand for the build. I\u2019m so proud of what we are accomplishing on the ground in Washington as we work to build some of the most efficient bitcoin mining infrastructure in North America.\u201d\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (Nasdaq: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122. Since 2014, we\u2019ve helped people achieve energy independence for their homes and businesses.
