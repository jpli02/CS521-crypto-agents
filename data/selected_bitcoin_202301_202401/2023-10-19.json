        "title": "Why Is XRP On Fire Today, Outshining Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Gains? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Ripple Labs\u2019 creation XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), has exhibited a surge of 7% in the past 24 hours, outpacing other prominent cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE).\n\nWhat Happened: As of the latest data, XRP was trading at $0.51, while BTC, ETH, and DOGE saw comparatively modest gains of 2.18%, 2.01%, and 0.18%, respectively, over the same 24-hour period.\n\nThis notable rise in XRP\u2019s value can be attributed to a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has decided to no longer pursue claims against Ripple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, and its Executive Chairman, Chris Larsen.\n\nThis development has led to the cancellation of a trial that was scheduled for the coming year, marking another favorable outcome for Ripple in the SEC\u2019s lengthy legal battle against the company. However, the SEC still intends to pursue its claims against Ripple itself.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

Don't let this chance slip away \u2013 secure early bird discounted tickets now!\n\nSee More: A Stay At The Floating Palace From James Bond's \u2018Octopussy\n\nWhy It Matters: The agreement reached between the parties involves the voluntary dismissal of the aiding and abetting charges against Garlinghouse and Larsen, with prejudice, meaning that these charges cannot be reinstated. The SEC will continue to pursue its claims against Ripple.\n\nGarlinghouse said, \u201cFor nearly three years, Chris and I have been the subject of baseless allegations from a rogue regulator with a political agenda. Instead of looking for the criminals stealing customer funds on offshore exchanges that were courting political favor, the SEC went after the good guys.\u201d\n\nThis development follows a partial victory secured by Ripple in July when a judge ruled that the company had not violated federal securities laws by making XRP available to retail investors through exchanges. However, the judge also found that the company had violated federal securities law by directly selling XRP to institutional investors.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $28,810.35, up 2.18% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Diamond Visuals On Shutterstock.com\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.
