        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been seeing bullish trends in recent months. However, experts believe that other cryptocurrencies, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and RenQ Finance (RENQ), may be ready for a surge in 2023. In this article, we will explore why experts are bullish on SHIB and RENQ and what factors may contribute to their potential growth.\n\nBTC sees bullish trends\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent surge to a nine-month high is a positive indication that the medium-term bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market is starting to shift. While the daily charts show a bullish trend, there may still be some short-term consolidation to consider.\n\nDuring Q1 of 2023, BTC/USD surpassed the 200-day moving average, the 89-day moving average, and the lower edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts, signaling the start of an uptrend. The downward correction in March was halted at the 200-day moving average, further supporting the emerging uptrend.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $30,400, after peaking at a 10-month high of $30,540 last week.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) Overview\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that was launched in August 2020. It was created as a decentralized alternative to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. SHIB has gained popularity due to its low value, which allows investors to buy large quantities of the cryptocurrency at a relatively low price.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ), on the other hand, is a DeFi token that aims to solve the liquidity problem faced by decentralized exchanges. It offers a comprehensive solution that is accessible to all types of traders, from novices to seasoned professionals. Its innovative features, strong community support, and potential for growth make it an attractive option for investors looking to get involved in the DeFi space.\n\nBullish Trends for SHIB and RENQ:\n\nExperts believe that both SHIB and RENQ are poised for a surge in 2023. Here are some of the reasons why:\n\nGrowing Popularity : SHIB has been gaining popularity in the crypto community due to its low value and meme-inspired nature. It has also been listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, which has increased its exposure and legitimacy in the market. RENQ has also been gaining popularity due to its innovative features and potential to solve the liquidity problem faced by decentralized exchanges.\n\n: SHIB has been gaining popularity in the crypto community due to its low value and meme-inspired nature.

        "title": "Stacks (STX): What if Bitcoin Had Smart Contracts? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Bitcoin maxis, beware! The Stacks crypto project is here to extend the Bitcoin blockchain beyond its limitations, bringing improved functionality to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency network.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns about Bitcoin (BTC) is its lack of utility outside of being a self-custodial digital asset payment network. The Stacks blockchain liberates Bitcoin from these limitations, building DeFi apps and NFTs on top of Bitcoin\u2019s impenetrable security.\n\nWhat is Stacks (STX)? How does this innovative Bitcoin layer work behind the scenes? Is it truly a threat to other smart contract-capable networks like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA)?\n\nWhat Is Stacks (STX)?\n\nStacks is a Layer-1 blockchain capable of supporting smart contracts. It aims to unlock the full potential of Bitcoin by providing an ecosystem of dApps and products that are settled on the world\u2019s most secure and decentralized blockchain.\n\nNot only does the Stacks network bring greater utility to Bitcoin, but it also seeks to resolve its scalability issues with higher transaction throughput. Could Stacks be the ultimate solution to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s symbolic blockchain trilemma?\n\nWhy Does Bitcoin Need Stacks?\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s position as the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency, it\u2019s often criticized as being nothing more than a decentralized store of value. As a payment network, many alternative blockchains like XRP are faster and more affordable.\n\nOn top of that, the Bitcoin blockchain doesn\u2019t support smart contracts, making it infinitely less useful than a network like Ethereum that hosts a multitude of DeFi apps. Apart from sending and receiving BTC between wallets, there\u2019s not much you can do with Bitcoin.\n\nAs a digital asset, BTC represents over $500 billion of liquidity but offers no way to leverage this value creatively. For example, there are no decentralized exchanges or lending platforms on Bitcoin.\n\nStacks solves this problem and brings integral blockchain functions, like decentralized finance and NFT technology, to the Bitcoin network.\n\nHow Does Stacks Work?\n\nThe Stacks network is an execution layer that settles complex transactions using the Bitcoin blockchain as a base layer.\n\nAt the core of this process are two unique features of the Stacks protocol. These are the Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus algorithm and the Clarity programming language.\n\nProof-of-Transfer (PoX)\n\nThe Proof-of-Transfer consensus mechanism is the key link between Stacks and Bitcoin. It\u2019s an extension of the Proof-of-Burn algorithm, wherein miners burn crypto as a proxy in exchange for computing resources to secure the chain.\n\nInstead of burning tokens in exchange for computing resources, tokens are committed to the Stacks protocol and transferred between network participants. We call these Miners and Stackers.\n\nSource: Stacks\n\nMiners transfer BTC to Stackers, hoping to win block rewards and transaction fees from the Stacks network. The chances of winning the block correspond to the amount of BTC committed.\n\nOn the hand, Stackers lock their STX tokens to the network in exchange for BTC committed to the network by Miners. After their lock-up period is complete, Stackers reclaim their STX tokens.\n\nClarity\n\nClarity is a smart contract programming language unique to the Stacks network. It\u2019s optimized for predictability and security and was specifically designed to combat common exploits seen in Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s dominant language.\n\nHere are some of the key features of the Clarity programming language:\n\nUncompiled \u2013 Clarity contracts are committed to the network exactly as they are written. In many other languages, contracts are compiled into byte-code before being submitted to the chain. This leaves room for the contract\u2019s missing aspects in translation, potentially opening the door to vulnerabilities.\n\n\u2013 Clarity contracts are committed to the network exactly as they are written. In many other languages, contracts are compiled into byte-code before being submitted to the chain. This leaves room for the contract\u2019s missing aspects in translation, potentially opening the door to vulnerabilities. Decidability \u2013 When writing Clarity contracts, developers can guarantee that program execution will terminate after a finite number of steps. This also makes it easier to ascertain transaction costs, meaning you\u2019ll never need to worry about running out of gas halfway through a transaction.\n\n\u2013 When writing Clarity contracts, developers can guarantee that program execution will terminate after a finite number of steps. This also makes it easier to ascertain transaction costs, meaning you\u2019ll never need to worry about running out of gas halfway through a transaction. Bitcoin compatible \u2013 Clarity smart contracts are designed to read the state of the native Bitcoin blockchain. This means developers implement Bitcoin transactions directly into their applications for seamless smart contract triggers.\n\nThe STX Token\n\nSTX is the native cryptocurrency of the Stacks blockchain. The Stacks token is used to pay transaction fees on the network and can be \u2018stacked\u2019 to earn BTC through the Proof-of-Exchange consensus mechanism. It\u2019s also used in the network\u2019s various dApps as collateral and a currency of exchange.\n\nInterestingly enough, Stacks STX emissions replicate Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle. Stacks block rewards are synchronized with Bitcoin halvings and cut in half roughly every four years.\n\nStacks History\n\nOriginally named Blockstack, the company was founded in 2013 by Ryan Shea and Muneeb Ali with the vision of solving pain points in web applications. Coming out of Princeton University, the startup was approved through the Y Combinator accelerator in 2014.\n\nIn 2019, Blockstack became the first company ever to receive approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell digital assets. The SEC-regulated token offering raised over $23 million.\n\nFollowing a full rebrand to Stacks in October 2020, the company published a new white paper outlining its plans for Stacks 2.0, the Bitcoin-adjacent execution layer we use today.\n\nThe Stacks Ecosystem\n\nThe Stacks ecosystem is home to a range of decentralized applications, wallet software, and NFT collections. While the Stacks network is still relatively young, the Stacks Foundation offers plenty of grants and funds incentivizing developers to join the ecosystem.\n\nStacks DeFi\n\nDecentralized exchanges and lending platforms are typically the cornerstone DeFi apps on emerging blockchains. Apps like StackSwap, Alex, and Zest Protocol are basic DeFi providers within the Stacks network.\n\nSource: StackSwap\n\nThe Arkadiko Protocol creates the leading stablecoin, USDA, on Stacks. Like Tether (USDT), USDA is pegged to the value of the U.S. Dollar.\n\nStacks NFTs\n\nBitcoin NFTs continue to gain traction in the Web3 world. While Ordinals have been the main driving force behind Bitcoin NFTs, the Stacks NFT ecosystem has been witnessing its own renaissance.\n\nGamma.io has established itself as the leading NFT marketplace for Bitcoin Ordinals and Stacks NFTs. Megapont Ape Club is the most well-known NFT collection on the Stacks network, generating over five million STX in trading volume.\n\nStacks Wallets\n\nHiro Wallet is undoubtedly the most widely used and trusted Stacks Wallet. With over 280,000 downloads, it tracks the value of your account in real-time and is the best place to store Ordinals and Stacks NFTs.\n\nUsers can also participate in the Proof-of-Exchange consensus and \u2018stack\u2019 STX coins to earn BTC rewards. The Hiro Wallet is available as both a desktop app and a browser extension.\n\nStacks Pros and Cons\n\nNow that we have a better understanding of the Stacks protocol and how it works, let\u2019s briefly recap its benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros\n\nScalable \u2013 The Stacks network addresses one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest faults: scalability. By breaking down blocks into micro blocks, Stacks can reach high transaction throughput and significantly reduce transaction fees when compared to the native Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u2013 The Stacks network addresses one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest faults: scalability.

Access Bitcoin Liquidity \u2013 BTC is the largest source of liquidity in the crypto market, but its lack of utility is a massive obstacle to adoption. Stacks resolves this issue and brings greater functionality to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\n\u2013 BTC is the largest source of liquidity in the crypto market, but its lack of utility is a massive obstacle to adoption. Stacks resolves this issue and brings greater functionality to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. Secure Native Programming Language \u2013 Clarity is designed to solve the pitfalls and common exploits of other smart contract languages. While this doesn\u2019t guarantee that every contract on Stacks is watertight, it leaves less room for error and offers increased user security.\n\nCons\n\nLow user count \u2013 Despite the innovation on display and the creativity of the PoX consensus, the Stacks network has struggled to attract high user numbers and TVL (total value locked). According to DefiLlama, the Stacks network has amassed less TVL than other small networks like Hedera Hashgraph, despite targeting the biggest source of liquidity in the space.\n\n\u2013 Despite the innovation on display and the creativity of the PoX consensus, the Stacks network has struggled to attract high user numbers and TVL (total value locked).

Small ecosystem \u2013 The range of applications available within the Stacks ecosystem pales compared to other blockchains. Coins with similar market caps, like Fantom, have almost ten times the number of dApps while similarly valued to STX.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe issues facing the Stacks network are, at face value, easily solvable. Generous incentive programs and grants are already in place to kickstart the growth and development of the blockchain.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nBitcoin is the face of the cryptocurrency industry, and its lack of utility is a poor reflection of the incredible progress being made in other realms of blockchain technology. By bringing new utility to BTC, the Stacks network is a net positive for the entire blockchain industry.\n\nFAQs"
