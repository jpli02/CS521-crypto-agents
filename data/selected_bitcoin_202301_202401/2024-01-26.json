        "content": "The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) on Friday became the first of the recently launched spot bitcoin products to reach $2 billion in assets under management (AUM). This doesn't include Grayscale's GBTC, which had nearly $30 billion in AUM at the time of its conversion from a closed-end fund to a spot ETF.\n\nInvestors added about $170 million to IBIT on Thursday, with the fund purchasing nearly another 4,300 bitcoin {{BTC}}, pushing total tokens held to 49,952. With the price of bitcoin rising well above the $40,000 level early Friday, that brought AUM to above $2 billion.\n\nNow with over $2 billion in AUM, the fund ranks third in asset gathering among all of the more than 600 ETFs that launched in the past year, noted ETF Store president Nate Geraci , who believes IBIT could soon take over the crown as number one.\n\nThe next fund to cross the $2 billion mark is likely to be Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which held just shy of 44,000 bitcoin as of Jan. 25."

        "content": "Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) are trending higher Friday morning following an upgrade from Oppenheimer. The firm upgraded Coinbase's stock from Perform to Outperform, setting a price target of $160 per share.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) is rebounding above $41,000 following a dip a week after spot bitcoin ETFs were approved\n\nYahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: Coinbase shares are getting a boost with Oppenheimer upgrading the stock to outperform from perform. And initiating its price target at $160 per share. The analyst behind the call citing Coinbase as a stronger than many people-- has stronger than many people realize. Excuse me. There you're taking a look at the price target $160 here. We were taking a look at the shares a moment ago.\n\nAnd this is actually a lift for the broader kind of crypto and the crypto trading names out there as well. We were tracking Marathon. That's one of the top trending tickers on the \"Yahoo Finance\" platform right now this morning. Pre-market, with about six minutes until the start of trade, and Bitcoin, as well. Perhaps, we can take a quick look at that just to see how things are faring there. Because, ultimately, over the course of this week, there was a lot of concern about whether or not we'd be able to keep this 40,000 level. We eventually got back up to. And now, have exceeded it. We're up by about 3% for Bitcoin here today too.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly, we are seeing some optimism creep back into the markets. Again, putting this in perspective, Bitcoin had been under a tremendous amount of pressure ever since we did get that decision from the SEC. A lot of that thought, though, some of that optimism of an approval already baked into the price. So we did see a bit of cooling. And you can see that a bit reflected in that stock chart that we have up there on the screen right now.\n\nSo we are above that 41,000 level now. Question is, how much higher can we climb? Can we get back to that 46,000, 47,000 level that we saw not too long ago. And again, because we're seeing the price of Bitcoin rise here, obviously, other names like Coinbase among the big leaders in today's market action.\n\nBut Oppenheimer here in this upgrade of Coinbase calling out a number of catalysts here. One, the prospect of stronger earnings, and also improving fundamentals. Because of that, they're raising the price target to 160. About $40 higher than where it's trading today."

        "title": "The bitcoin ETF market's single point of failure - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we\u2019re looking at Coinbase\u2019s role in the industry\u2019s newly approved bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAfter two weeks of life, there are some things we know about the string of bitcoin exchange traded funds that have proliferated on US stock markets.\n\nThe largest, Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, is experiencing a huge outflow of assets. The regulatory approval that opened the door for more investors to get exposure to bitcoin can also be the passage to leave a service you\u2019re unhappy with, or simply exit the market altogether.\n\nWe also know that sometimes it\u2019s better to travel than arrive. Since approval was confirmed bitcoin is down about 15 per cent.\n\nBut an important point has thus far flown under the radar: the safety and security of the bitcoins on which the ETFs are built.\n\nLegally speaking the ETF sponsors such as BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark etc hold the bitcoins in a trust; in practice the assets are held by a custodian on behalf of the trust. Eight of the 11 sponsors have chosen Coinbase as their custodian. Fidelity is using its own digital asset custody business.\n\nThis raises eyebrows for two reasons: first, the exchange is being sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly failing to register as a national securities exchange, among other things.\n\nIn one \u2014 narrow, legal \u2014 sense, that lawsuit focuses \u201conly\u201d on whether Coinbase filled in correct forms or not. It doesn\u2019t pass judgment on Coinbase\u2019s capabilities or business practices. Even if the SEC is successful, the lawsuit won\u2019t necessarily hinder Coinbase\u2019s ability to offer custodial services to clients.\n\nSecondly and more importantly \u2014 and I will emphasise this contradiction for as long as the word decentralisation is synonymous with crypto \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s dominance of the custody market is a major single point of failure for the new sector.\n\nAnyone who has paid attention to crypto for even five minutes knows the problems this market has always had in holding and protecting other people\u2019s assets.\n\nMt. Gox customers are still waiting for their money after a hack in 2014 caused the infamous exchange to fail. Investors in Celsius and of course, FTX, are still trying to get their money back.\n\nCoinbase is a different entity and says it maintains very strict walls between its operations. Its exchange and custody business shouldn\u2019t be at risk from market volatility.\n\nStill, imagine \u2014 hypothetically of course \u2014 that Coinbase was hacked or it suddenly collapsed in the manner of many crypto companies before it. What then?\n\n\u201cThere is always a risk that a custodian could collapse, and I think the risk is heightened whenever you\u2019re talking about a less mature market, like crypto is,\u201d said Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price.\n\nI reached out to each of the eight firms with Coinbase, and asked them what their Plan B was, as a back up. Only two responded. WisdomTree and Grayscale both said they could choose to change custodian at their own discretion.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen crypto companies collapse at speed: will the sponsors be fast enough to react? And if not, what happens to the stranded assets?\n\nBlackRock\u2019s prospectus \u2014 to take one example \u2014 makes things pretty clear.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk that customers\u2019 assets \u2014 including the Trust\u2019s assets \u2014 may be considered the property of the bankruptcy estate of . . . the bitcoin custodian, and customers \u2014 including the Trust \u2014 may be at risk of being treated as general unsecured creditors of such entities and subject to the risk of total loss or markdowns on value of such assets.\u201d\n\nGrayscale\u2019s risk factors are similarly blunt: \u201cThe legal rights of customers with respect to digital assets held on their behalf by a third-party custodian, such as the Custodian, in insolvency proceedings are currently uncertain.\u201d\n\nOuch. It\u2019s not much better if the custodian is hacked.\n\nBlackRock says its bitcoin custodian has insurance coverage \u201cof up to $320mn that covers losses of the digital assets it custodies on behalf of its clients\u201d. That\u2019s not a lot to cover $2bn of assets under management.\n\nIn fairness to Coinbase, it recognises its unique position. \u201cWe are committed to sharing and creating transparent industry standards to develop the security capability of industry peers, and welcome the future diversification of custodianship,\u201d Philip Martin, the exchange\u2019s chief security officer, told me.\n\nCompetition for custody business seems to be on its way. Anchorage Digital Bank \u2014 which holds a bank charter from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \u2014 has designs on the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the natural diversification partner for ETF issuers,\u201d chief executive Nathan McCauley told me on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re spending a lot of time, energy and effort to make sure we capture that.\u201d\n\nFrom a risk management perspective, diversification is always handy. But if a crypto Willie Sutton appears, ETF investors large and small have the same minimal safety net that purchasers of cryptocurrencies have.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Coinbase\u2019s role as custodian for so many bitcoin ETFs? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of bitcoin ETFs, don\u2019t miss my story this week on bitcoin losing 15 per cent of its value over the past two weeks. Underwhelming flows into the newly approved league of bitcoin ETFs have \u2014 so far \u2014 given the lie to the market\u2019s assumption that new investors would be drawn into bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe Bank of England and HM Treasury on Thursday responded to a public consultation that brings the UK potentially closer to launching a digital pound. Concerns surrounding user privacy were raised last year, but this week the BoE and HMT committed to introduce primary legislation to parliament aimed at protecting the public\u2019s financial privacy should a digital pound be eventually rolled out.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Drawing battle lines\n\nYou may recall the US Office of Foreign Assets Control imposing sanctions on crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, alleging the platform helped launder billions of dollars worth of illicit funds linked to North Korea-backed criminal hackers.\n\nRoman Storm, one of the developers behind the service, also faces a criminal trial to answer charges of money laundering and the violation of sanctions rules. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNow he is seeking crowdfunding to pay for his defence.\n\nFolks, I need your help. Whether you\u2019re a passionate developer like me involved with Web 3, or you just care about software and privacy, this legal battle will affect you, so please help contribute to my legal defence because this case will set a major precedent for years to come.\u201d\n\nData Mining: Ether falls with bitcoin\n\nBitcoin went on a four-month surge on expectations that the SEC would finally approve exchange traded funds. The second-largest cryptocurrency, ether, is also on the same regulatory journey \u2014 but its price isn\u2019t enjoying the same boost.\n\nLike bitcoin, it has dropped since the SEC approved the first spot crypto exchange traded funds. This week the SEC pushed back the date for approval of an ether ETF again but there\u2019s still several months to go before the regulator runs out of road and has to make a decision.\n\nBut the market seems to have learned an important lesson: the approval of an exchange traded fund doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the price of the underlying asset is going to fly.
