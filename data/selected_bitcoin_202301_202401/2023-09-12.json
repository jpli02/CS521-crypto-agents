        "content": "The price of bitcoin bounced Tuesday, reversing losses from the previous day that were driven by fears around FTX liquidations.\n\nBitcoin was last higher by 4.5% at $26,185.72, according to Coin Metrics. On Monday, bitcoin dipped below the key $25,000 support level for the first time since March. The rebound could be fueled in part by investors who were betting against the crypto asset scrambling to cover short positions, in other words, by a short squeeze.\n\nInvestors have been selling their crypto in anticipation of a hearing Wednesday in which liquidators could be permitted to start selling the assets of FTX and Alameda Research, its sister company. The tokens native to the Solana and Polygon networks are among some of the company's biggest holdings. On Monday, they fell 3% and 5%, respectively. On Tuesday, they were last higher by about 2.5% each.\n\nThere's still room for disappointment, however. Fairlead Strategies' Katie Stockton said weakened momentum in the intermediate term could make it difficult for bitcoin to see a durable recovery. With Tuesday's bounce, the cryptocurrency's next level to test on the upside is $27,600 \u2014 its 50-day moving average.\n\nFTX liquidations aside, the crypto market has recently struggled for meaningful catalysts as investors wait for clearer regulation and attention has shifted back to inflation and economic inputs after a string of stronger-than-expected data points last week renewed concern that the Federal Reserve could raise rates once more before year-end.\n\nThis week, investors get the August consumer price index and producer price index readings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively."

        "content": "Bitcoin only exchange Bull Bitcoin, has announced that it has expanded its services to enable Costa Ricans and foreigners to buy and sell Bitcoin using SINPE Movil, the country's primary fiat payment system, in partnership with circular BTC economy project Bitcoin Jungle, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This collaboration not only opens up new opportunities for those looking to utilize Bitcoin in the country but also simplifies the process of converting Costa Rican colones to BTC and vice versa.\n\nBull Bitcoin is now the first and only Bitcoin exchange in Costa Rica to facilitate seamless transactions using SINPE Movil, the payment network widely embraced by over an estimated 90% of Costa Rican consumers. This development represents a significant milestone, as it grants nearly every Costa Rican access to a secure, low-cost, instant on-ramp and off-ramp for Bitcoin.\n\nFor the first time, residents and visitors alike can effortlessly convert colones to Bitcoin and Bitcoin to colones without the hassle of complex international bank transfers and expensive currency conversion fees. Additionally, Bull Bitcoin allows for conversions to and from bank accounts (IBAN) in both CRC and USD via regular bank transfers, further enhancing the flexibility of Bitcoin usage.\n\nBitcoin Jungle, an open-source community project tailored for Costa Rica, has been instrumental in onboarding hundreds of local merchants, including independent vendors at farmers' markets, into the Bitcoin ecosystem over the past three years. In some regions, like Bahia Ballena, Bitcoin Jungle has effectively established a circular Bitcoin economy.\n\nHowever, one major challenge faced by Bitcoin Jungle was the inability to \"cash out\" Bitcoin for local currency, which hindered broader adoption among merchants. Bull Bitcoin's integration into the Bitcoin Jungle wallet solves this issue by enabling merchants to easily convert their Bitcoin holdings to fiat currency, bolstering their confidence in accepting Bitcoin payments.\n\nTo take advantage of this service, users must download the Bitcoin Jungle wallet and register a username. Within the wallet's settings, they can select the SINPE Movil option to access the buy and sell Bitcoin interface. Purchasing Bitcoin requires a SINPE Movil account, available to Costa Rican citizens and residents, and entails sending funds to Bull Bitcoin's phone number, after which Bitcoin is automatically credited to their Bitcoin Jungle wallet.\n\nThis partnership between Bull Bitcoin and Bitcoin Jungle not only simplifies financial transactions in Costa Rica but also helps to position the country as an internationally recognized Bitcoin hub. By offering locals, tourists, and expats a convenient Bitcoin standard for everyday transactions, Bull Bitcoin and Bitcoin Jungle are driving the adoption of BTC in this vibrant Central American nation.\n\nBull Bitcoin\u2019s entry in the Costa Rica Bitcoin market officially starts its long-awaited international expansion. Over the next 12 months, the exchange will become available to over a billion people worldwide, according to the release. After almost 10 years of being available only in Canada and serving a market of 35 million individuals, Bull Bitcoin says they're ready to offer its internationally-acclaimed services to users across the world.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "The correlation between bitcoin and its implied volatility has turned negative again, indicating investor concerns about moves to the downside.\n\nInvestors seem worried that impending FTX liquidations and continued monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve will drive crypto prices lower, according to one analyst.\n\nBitcoin's (BTC) price and the cryptocurrency's forward-looking 30-day implied volatility gauge are again moving in the opposite direction. The return to a negative correlation represents concerns about looming FTX liquidations, according to observers.\n\nThe 60-day trailing correlation between bitcoin's price and implied volatility flipped negative a week ago and fell to -0.29 early Tuesday, according to Velo Data.\n\nBitcoin's price has declined by almost 10% in four weeks. The price hit a three-month low below $25,000 on Monday as traders took account of the possibility that defunct crypto exchange FTX will secure bankruptcy court approval to start selling its $3.4 billion worth of crypto holdings. Leading crypto options exchange Deribit's BTC DVOL index, which measures the 30-day implied volatility, has increased to 42 from 32 in the past four weeks.\n\nA decrease in price alongside an increase in implied volatility indicates bias for put options, derivative contracts offering protection against price slides. Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period and is influenced by demand for both call and put options. That means the negative correlation stems from expectations of and positioning for a potential FTX-induced aversion to risk.\n\n\"The market has spent the last few months preparing for a potential ETF approval and has thus been very concerned about asymmetric moves to the topside.\" Jeff Anderson, a senior trader at STS Digital, told CoinDesk. \"That sentiment has shifted recently with the FTX liquidation news and fears that the bottom could fall out of the spot price. As such, the implied volatility has gone bid with spot prices moving in an area of perceived weakness.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGriffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said concerns of additional monetary tightening in global markets are also behind the shift in the volatility trend.\n\n\"The impending U.S. August CPI data will likely show a rebound in inflation, which means the Federal Reserve (Fed) will probably take additional liquidity-tightening measures to curb reflation. In liquidity redistribution, crypto assets are prioritized last, which means that the liquidity stored in crypto assets could be withdrawn and invested in assets such as cash or U.S. stocks,\" Ardern said.\n\n\"That has pushed up investors' preference for puts, bringing a negative correlation between prices and volatility,\" Ardern added.\n\nAccording to RBC Economics, the CPI report due Wednesday is expected to show the cost of living in the U.S. ticked higher to 3.6% year-over-year in August, up from 3.2% in July. Several leading indicators have warned of an inflation rebound in the coming months. That's likely to keep the Fed from cutting interest rates and injecting liquidity into the market anytime soon.\n\nThe correlation has recently flipped negative, reflecting investor fears about potential price slide. (Velo Data)\n\nThe year has been characterized by consistent positive market value-volatility correlation, barring the latest negative flip and the one seen in May.\n\nThe positive correlation meant price rallies rewarded BTC call option holders with directional gains as well as volatility gains. With the return of negative correlation, put holders stand to make outsized money during potential price drops relative to what calls would earn during price rallies. That's usually the case in the equity markets."
