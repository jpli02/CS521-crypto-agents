The allegations surfaced in a Sept. 1 lawsuit in New Jersey against B2C2 by its former global head of options trading, Bradley Nagela, who said he was fired in retaliation for raising concerns about Gillespie\u2019s behavior."

The fund offers \"long-only exposure to Bitcoin (BTC)\" and is a segment of Laser Digital Funds Segregated Portfolio Company. The aim of the fund is to provide institutional investors with a secure path into digital asset investment. Nomura Holdings is a $500 billion financial giant that provides brokerage, investment banking, and asset management services.\n\nThe Bitcoin Adoption Fund is designed to entice institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin. It will allow institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to hold the cryptocurrency directly. The fund is expected to attract a wide range of institutional investors, including pension funds, endowments, and family offices.\n\nNomura's move to launch a Bitcoin Adoption Fund comes as more institutional investors are showing interest in cryptocurrencies. The fund is expected to capitalize on the growing demand for Bitcoin among institutional investors. The launch of the fund is also seen as a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Bitcoin Adoption Fund is the latest in a series of moves by Nomura to expand its presence in the cryptocurrency market. In 2022, Nomura acquired a stake in a cryptocurrency exchange, and in 2023, it launched a cryptocurrency custody service. The launch of the Bitcoin Adoption Fund is expected to further strengthen Nomura's position in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nLaser Digital has picked Komainu as the fund's regulated custody partner. The Bitcoin Adoption Fund is a mutual fund registered in the Cayman Islands. Nomura has been an active participant in the digital asset ecosystem, establishing a digital asset venture capital arm in 2022 and acquiring a license from Dubai's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher, around $1.07 trillion, rising 0.62% in the last 24 hours.\"Bitcoin's price has surged beyond the $27,000 threshold, and this upward trajectory could likely be attributed to Nomura, one of Japan's leading investment banks, unveiling a Bitcoin-based fund designed for institutional investors,\" said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex.Market sentiment currently varies from neutral to bullish as market participants await the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision regarding interest rates, set to be announced later today, Edul said.The total volume in DeFi is currently $2.23 billion, 7.94% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $25.78 billion, which is 91.89% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.The market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $527 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 49.16%, according to CoinMarketCap.Meanwhile, BTC volume stood at approximately $14.5 billion, falling 3.86% in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin recently broke the long-term resistance at $26,800, attributed to the \u201cdouble top\u201d pattern seen in the 4-hour period. This breach also marked a successful breakout of the previous downtrend line, signaling the potential for a continued bullish trend.A dominant bullish candle on the 4-hour chart suggests strong bullish momentum with an immediate resistance or target around $27,500 and the possibility of testing $27,900 if the momentum holds. A sustained upside run could push Bitcoin to the $28,800 level and beyond.Critical support now lies at $26,800, once a resistance level, with potential secondary support at $26,300. Vigilance at $26,800 is essential; staying above is bullish, while falling below may require caution and consideration of short positions.: Quick Glance (Source: coinmarketcap.com, data as of 11.50 hours, IST on September 20, 2023)Bitcoin $27,044 0.94%Ethereum $1,634 -0.02%Tether $1 0.01%BNB $216 -0.08%XRP $0.5188 2.05%Cardano $0.2536 -0.02%Dogecoin $0.06233 0.13%Toncoin $2.52 3.68%Solana $19.92 0.56%Polygon $0.5399 2.22%Litecoin $66.53 -0.82%Polkadot $4.12 0.21%Tron $0.08438 0.10%Shiba Inu $0.00000738 1.40%(Note: Price change in last 24 hours)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
