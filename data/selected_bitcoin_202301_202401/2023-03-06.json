        "content": "A joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC. has brought the first nuclear-powered Bitcoin mine online in Pennsylvania.\n\nTerawulf has announced roughly half of its nuclear-powered Nautilus Cryptomine has come online. The mining facility, a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC., derives its energy wholly from the 2.5 GW Susquehanna nuclear generation station in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe full operation will amount to 50 MW and 1.9 EH/s, with an option for Terawulf to add an additional 50 MW of bitcoin mining capacity, \u201cwhich the Company plans to deploy in future phases,\u201d according to a press release.\n\nPaul Prager, chairman and CEO of TeraWulf, said that \u201cthe recent energization of the Nautilus facility earlier this month, approximately 16,000 of TeraWulf\u2019s owned miners, representing 1.9 EH/s of self-mining capacity, are onsite and being brought online daily.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Nautilus nuclear-powered mining facility benefits from what is arguably the lowest cost power in the sector, just $0.02/kWh for a term of five years,\u201d Prager commented.\n\nMining consultant and cofounder of Citadel 256, Magdalena Gronowska, previously described in an article for Bitcoin Magazine how nuclear power can revolutionize Bitcoin mining.\n\n\n\n\u201cNuclear is a carbon free, reliable and cheap energy source,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cIt's not perfect in that it emits nuclear waste, but every energy source has tradeoffs between environmental footprint, reliability and capital and operating costs\u2026 We need a diverse mix of energy generation, to serve both baseload and peak load, as we transition to a low carbon economy.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nAn ominous-sounding technical pattern has appeared on bitcoin's (BTC) weekly price chart for the first time on record. Analysts, however, are split on what it means for cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin's 50-week simple moving average has crossed under its 200-week SMA, confirming a \"death cross,\" a bearish indicator suggesting the short-term price pullback could become a more sustained downtrend.\n\nEven though the moving average-based death cross represents what happened in the past, many consider it a forward-looking indicator.\n\n\"The death cross formed on the weekly time frame makes for a cautious view of the near-term outlook and keeps the potential for a return to the $18,000-$16,300,\" Alex Kuptsikevich, a market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.\n\nOne could argue that the death cross has come at the right time for bears, considering the crisis at crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank and surging interest rate expectations across the advanced world.\n\nBitcoin fell nearly 5% last week as Silvergate said it was evaluating its ability to survive as a going concern. The leading cryptocurrency ran into offers around the 50-week SMA for the second straight week.\n\n\"Technically, the 50-week moving average continues to act as a valid resistance from which the selling intensifies,\" Kuptsikevich said.\n\nSome observers, however, don't see the death cross as a reliable indicator, because it is based on backward-looking moving averages and lags prices and has proved to be a contrary indicator in stock markets.\n\n\"A death cross is a nonevent. A weekly death cross means the 50-week average dropped below the 200-week average. They are *lagging* indicators that definitionally occur after a rapid decline,\" Timothy Peterson, investment manager at Cane Island Alternative Investments, tweeted last month.\n\nAccording to Peterson, the death cross has been unreliable as a standalone indicator in traditional markets.\n\n\"For the S&P 500 going back nearly 100 years, there have been 9 such occurrences: 1938, 48, 58, 63 , 70, 74, 78, 2001, '08.,\" Peterson said. \"Within 50 days, the average gain was 22% and the average loss was -9%. Within 200 days, the average gain was 46% and the average loss was -11%. Those are great risk/return odds.\""

        "title": "What Is a Sovereign Rollup? Rollkit Pitches Second Layer for Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Just a few months after the very first NFT was inscribed into Bitcoin, developers are trying to imbue the age-old blockchain with another new-age technology: rollups.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what Rollkit\u2014a self-described \u201cmodular framework for rollups\u201d\u2014claimed over Twitter on Sunday, revealing a research integration that would allow \u201csovereign rollups\u201d on Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Rollkit, its new rollup solution lets users produce rollups by retrieving and storing data on the Bitcoin blockchain. It was inspired by Ordinals, the Bitcoin NFT protocol which showed developers that\u2014using Taproot\u2014users could post arbitrary data to the blockchain.\n\nHow did we do it? \ud83d\udca1 Ordinals showed us it was possible to publish arbitrary data to Bitcoin. We saw this and decided to follow a similar process. At its core, all that was needed was two functions: one to submit rollup blocks, and another to retrieve them. pic.twitter.com/u6etICUAtg \u2014 Rollkit (@RollkitDev) March 5, 2023\n\nIn the traditional sense, rollups are batches of transactions that are \u201crolled up\u201d off chain into one transaction, and then posted to Ethereum as a single on-chain transaction. This helps free up blockspace and lower transaction costs on the network, while still inheriting the settlement assurances of the base chain.\n\nA sovereign rollup is one that does not need a smart contract or use a settlement layer for validation\u2014scalable and secure and with the \"sovereignty\" of a layer 1.\n\nHowever, some proponents of Ethereum, a network known to use layer-2 \u201crollups\u201d as a transaction scaling solution, have taken issue with Rollkit\u2019s use of the term.\n\nRyan Berckmans, a Web3 and Ethereum investor, said on Twitter that the sovereign rollup \u201cis actually an alt L1 that stores its block data on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to Alexei Zamyatin, founder of the Bitcoin DeFi protocol Interlay, sovereign rollups as proposed by Rollkit inherit \u201cnothing\u201d of Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cData availability\u2014okay, but honestly, that's been used since 2012,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe entire post describes 'I write some data to Bitcoin' with fancy buzzwords.\u201d\n\nRollkit is still bullish on the possibilities.\n\n\u201cThis new integration expands the possibilities for rollups, and also has the potential to help bootstrap a healthy blockspace fee market on Bitcoin, enabling a more sustainable security budget,\u201d the company writes.\n\nSome are likening sovereign rollups to Stacks, a high functionality layer 1 protocol that settles its blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain for security purposes. Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali said on Twitter that this is an apt comparison, but noted some key differences.\n\nOn one hand, it takes 150 Stacks blocks before a transaction reaches\u201dBitcoin finality\u201d on Stacks, but only 1 with sovereign rollups. On the other, Stacks blocks publish their data to Bitcoin in an efficient manner by merely hashing the data on-chain, whereas sovereign rollups publishes the full data.\n\n\u201cThe technically challenging part for both the Stacks layer and sovereign rollups is moving BTC in and out of the layer, said Ali. \u201cThe decentralized BTC peg is the most important part.\u201d"

        "title": "SEC's Gensler Warns Crypto Investors, but Differentiates Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nGary Gensler, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has recently made some comments on the legal status of Bitcoin that investors should note.\n\nGensler, who has spent much of his career with investment banks and government positions, has commented on the legal status of bitcoin in his role as the SEC chair several times since 2021. The SEC is designed to ensure a safe regulatory environment for investors and to protect consumers from illegal activity, making its positions important to any crypto investor.\n\nOn February 27, Gensler made comments in an interview about the state of the wider crypto industry. Specifically, he claimed that \u201ceverything but bitcoin\u201d could be considered a security in the world of cryptocurrency, while bitcoin could be considered a commodity due to its stature and resolutely-decentralized nature. The difference between securities and commodities is often determined by the Howey Test, based on a Supreme Court case from 1946, which dictates that the difference between the two is determined by the expectation that investors will profit as well as the status of the party offering a sale. Securities must follow a far more stringent series of restrictions than commodities do, so Gensler\u2019s determination of bitcoin\u2019s status could have major investment implications.\n\nIn what Time called a \u201cfederal offensive\u201d against the cryptocurrency industry, it noted that Gensler\u2019s SEC has been shutting down a variety of crypto businesses and leading other institutions like the Federal Reserve to decry the risks of crypto and stablecoins. Gensler has personally questioned exchanges\u2019 ability to custody funds, saying that, \u201cJust because a crypto trading platform claims to be a qualified custodian doesn\u2019t mean that it is.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that these are only his personal views and not in themselves a binding opinion of the federal government\u2019s, but nevertheless, they have been provocative enough for Ripple to call on Gensler to recuse himself in an ongoing legal battle between itself and the SEC.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s design renders it immune from many criticisms of the broader industry and Gensler has claimed unequivocally that bitcoin should be held to different standards. Any arguments against a particular exchange or altcoin project will not apply to the first-ever cryptocurrency. However, even if bitcoin itself will not be attacked, a frostier environment for the wider world of crypto could have negative effects. An important goal for Bitcoiners is widespread adoption, which could be more difficult if exchanges dealing in bitcoin go under. The same effects could hold for a crackdown on miners and lenders, even if Bitcoin exists worldwide.\n\nAs a result, investors need to be cautious about these developments and their potential impacts on the world of cryptocurrency, and also recognize the variety of reasons that betting on bitcoin remains the best and safest option for many. Even with a variety of hostile attacks to the ecosystem as a whole, one can never forget that Bitcoin is the first trailblazer, with years of experience in flourishing under hostile regulators. Any number of cryptocurrency projects could become more dicey propositions if the federal government takes up a firm offense, but Bitcoin has demonstrated time and again that it is capable of coming out of these periods stronger than ever before.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
