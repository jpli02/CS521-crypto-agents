Some of the attendees at those meetings included representatives from BlackRock, Grayscale Investments, ARK Invest and 21 Shares.\n\nThe meetings also reportedly featured representatives of the exchanges that would potentially list the new products, including Nasdaq and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, as well as lawyers and issuers.\n\nRegulators reportedly told attendees at the meetings that any issuer that doesn\u2019t meet the Dec. 29 deadline will not be part of a first wave of potential spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in early January.\n\nFox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett was among the first to report on the deadline. Terrett subsequently confirmed the date for final amendments to all S-1s by Dec. 29.\n\n\u201cThe SEC told issuers that applications that are fully finished and filed by Friday will be considered in the first wave,\u201d the journalist wrote on X (formerly Twitter).

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value soared from the cost of electricity to mine Bitcoin in 2009 to over $43,407 by 2023.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance fell from 100% to 52% by 2023, diversifying the crypto landscape.\n\nThe crypto market cap grew from zero in 2009 to $1.63 trillion in 2023, outlining Bitcoin\u2019s and the crypto industries\u2019 meteoric rise over the last decade and a half.\n\nBitcoin demonstrated resilience and volatility, fluctuating prices due to global events and trends.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s journey from a price of $0.003 in 2009 to over $37,000 in 2023, alongside its fluctuating market dominance, highlights its status as a top-performing asset and store of value. Despite its dominance dropping from 100% to 52%, reflecting a more diverse crypto market, Bitcoin\u2019s significant volatility has been central to its rapid value appreciation.\n\nThis growth, mirrored by the crypto market cap\u2019s rise to $1.4 trillion in 2023, showcases Bitcoin\u2019s impact and profitability in the financial world over the last 15 years. Below is an outline of its trajectory, taking the price on Christmas day.\n\nYear Bitcoin Price On Christmas Day\n\n\u2013 $ Bitcoin Dominance CoinMarketCap\n\n\u2013 $ Billion 2009 0.003 100% 0.00 2010 0.25 99.5% 0.05 2011 4.07 99% 0.10 2012 13.34 98% 0.10 2013 669.50 98% 1.50 2014 320.20 98% 4.44 2015 449.92 99% 6.86 2016 883.73 95% 14.85 2017 14,146.95 48% 494.90 2018 3,881.91 55% 122.02 2019 7,206.91 70% 184.89 2020 24,165.49 69% 648.67 2021 50,654.88 40% 2.37 T 2022 16,801.54 43% 770.4 2023 43,407.50 52% 1.63 T\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Shift From 2009\u2019s Negligible Value To 2012\u2019s Steady Growth\n\n2009 To 2012\n\nIn its infancy, Bitcoin was a mere concept, valued at the price of electricity necessary to mine Bitcoin, which was roughly $0.003 in 2009, with the entire crypto market cap at virtually zero.\n\nBy 2012, as Bitcoin\u2019s price rose to $13.34, the total market cap reached $0.10 billion, indicating a young but growing interest in the cryptocurrency space. This period laid the groundwork for the crypto revolution despite the infant market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Early Growth: Price Trends And Public Sentiment (2013 To 2016)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Emergence: A Look Back At 2013 To 2016\n\nThis era marked Bitcoin\u2019s entry into public consciousness. 2013 saw a significant surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $669.50 and the market cap expanding to $1.50 billion, signaling a bullish trend.\n\nHowever, the following years witnessed fluctuations, with the market cap reflecting these changes at $4.44 billion in 2014 and $6.86 billion in 2015, finally reaching $14.85 billion in 2016. These figures underscored the growing but volatile nature of the market.\n\nBitcoin Surge And Volatility Between 2017 And 2019\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Rollercoaster Ride: From 2017\u2019s Record Highs To 2019\u2019s Recovery\n\nDuring this era, Bitcoin experienced a period of substantial growth and corrections. The year 2017 was a milestone, with Bitcoin\u2019s price reaching $14,146.95 and the total market cap soaring to a staggering $494.90 billion.\n\nThis bubble, however, was followed by a significant correction in 2018, with the market cap dropping to $122.02 billion. The market cap 2019 ($184.89 billion) reflected a partial recovery, indicative of a market that was beginning to mature and stabilize.\n\nBitcoin During The COVID-19 Period (Between 2020 And 2022): Market Resilience and Pandemic Impact\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Evolution Through Pandemic Turbulence\n\nThe pandemic years were a testament to Bitcoin\u2019s resilience. In 2020, the price escalated to $24,165.49, with the market cap reaching $648.67 billion, driven by a surge in institutional investment and a quest for digital safe-haven assets.\n\nThe trend continued in 2021, with the market cap peaking at $2.37 trillion. However, 2022 saw a pullback in both price ($16,801.54) and market cap ($770.4 billion), reflecting global economic uncertainties and market corrections.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Throughout History\n\nBitcoin has stood as a pioneering force since its inception in 2009. Initially, Bitcoin held an unchallenged dominance of 100%, reflecting its status as the sole player and first cryptocurrency in the crypto market.\n\nThis dominance, a measure of Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization relative to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, remained exceedingly high in the early years, hovering around 98-99%. However, as the crypto market expanded and diversified, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance gradually reduced.\n\nFrom a commanding presence of nearly 100% in 2009, it experienced fluctuations, notably dropping to 48% in 2017 during the ICO boom and Ethereum\u2019s introduction into the crypto market in 2015-2017, then partially recovering and eventually stabilizing to a more contested position of around 52% by 2023.\n\nThis shift illustrates not just the growth of Bitcoin in absolute terms but also the rapid emergence and expansion of other cryptocurrencies, reshaping the digital asset landscape.\n\nChristmas Day And Bitcoin: Understanding Historical Price Patterns\n\nThe Christmas day price analysis reveals that Bitcoin\u2019s performance during this festive season mirrors the broader market trends. The market cap data adds context to these trends, showing how the entire crypto market has responded in tandem with Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\n\nFor instance, the high market cap during the bull runs of 2017 and the pandemic years contrasts with the lower market caps during the bearish phases.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Christmas Day Price Predictions: Expert Opinions\n\nPredicting Bitcoin\u2019s future, especially based on Christmas Day prices, is difficult to predict. Adam Back, a key figure in the cryptocurrency sector, believes that Bitcoin\u2019s value could reach $100,000 before its next halving in April 2024.\n\nAdam Back explains that his prediction is influenced by factors such as the historical impact of Bitcoin halving events on Bitcoin\u2019s price, in prior years, increasing mainstream adoption, and broader economic conditions. However, caution is always advised to crypto investors because the crypto market is still young and influenced by various factors. Making predictions is challenging but intriguing for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin\u2019s evolution to a store of value asset, digital gold, from the cost of electricity to a value of mere cents to tens of thousands of dollars is not just a story of financial growth but also one of technological innovation, evolving public perception and education, and the ever-changing dynamics of the global economy.\n\nThe fluctuating dominance of Bitcoin, once the unrivaled king of cryptocurrencies, is now sharing the stage with many other digital assets, particularly Ethereum, which highlights the diversification and maturation of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow has Bitcoin\u2019s price changed on Christmas Day since 2009?\n\nSince 2009, Bitcoin\u2019s Christmas Day price has grown from just $0.003 to $43,407.50 in 2023, reflecting its evolution from a novel concept to a significant financial asset.\n\nWhat does the decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance indicate?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decreasing dominance, from 100% in 2009 to 52% in 2023, indicates a diversifying crypto market with the emergence of other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, expanding the digital asset landscape.\n\nHow did the crypto market cap evolve alongside Bitcoin\u2019s growth?\n\nThe crypto market cap has grown significantly, from virtually zero in 2009 to $1.4 trillion in 2023, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s price increase and indicating increased investor interest and market maturity.\n\nCan Bitcoin\u2019s historical Christmas Day prices predict its future?\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s Christmas Day prices provide insights into historical trends, predicting its future based on these prices is complex due to the influence of various unpredictable market factors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information provided is for educational and analytical purposes only.

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin in India - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The grand old cryptocurrency has had plenty of aficionados in the Indian crypto space. Consensus and YouGov conducted a global survey on crypto and Web3 in unison. They published a report on June 23, revealing that 32% of Indians had bought cryptocurrencies at some point, and 21% still owned digital assets. It also revealed that Bitcoin (BTC) dominated the cryptocurrencies purchased.\n\nLevying a 30% tax on income received from digital assets didn\u2019t dent the sentiment in the country regarding cryptocurrencies. According to a report published by the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange, the digital assets market in India is expected to clock $241 million by 2030.\n\nAs the world\u2019s most populous country, with 1.4 billion people, India comes across as a country with millions of prospective cryptocurrency investors. Based on data from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 68% of this demographic falls within the 15\u201364 age range, indicating a higher likelihood of interest in cryptocurrencies such as BTC.\n\nThis article explains how to buy Bitcoin in India on centralized and decentralized exchanges, systematic investment plan (SIP), over-the-counter (OTC) deals or direct peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges.\n\nHow to buy BTC on a centralized crypto exchange in India\n\nCatering to millions of prospective Bitcoin buyers, there are hundreds of centralized exchanges operating in India, both local and multinational. One needs to check factors such as ease of use, security and low fees when zeroing in on an exchange.\n\nOne needs to complete the exchange registration process, including verifying their phone number and email. The next step is Know Your Customer (KYC), a government-mandated procedure that requires the person to submit a soft copy of their identification documents with the exchange. A team verifies these documents before giving access to the applicant. KYC regulations aim to prevent financial crimes such as identity theft and money laundering.\n\nOne can buy Bitcoin via OTC or P2P trading on a centralized exchange. OTC trading has a minimum order size. For instance, CoinDCX has a minimum order size of 15,000 Tether (USDT) or 12,00,000 Indian rupees (whichever is lesser), while WazirX OTC Desk serves large crypto volumes worth $50,000 and above.\n\nOne may take the P2P route to buy BTC for lower denominations. The role of the exchange is to facilitate a direct deal between the buyer and the seller while acting as an escrow, ensuring nobody is at a loss. The exchange holds the money paid to the seller. Once the buyer receives BTC, the amount is transferred. The buyer can pay in fiat or any other cryptocurrency acceptable to the seller.\n\nHow to buy BTC on a decentralized crypto exchange in India\n\nAs the name suggests, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is designed to facilitate P2P transactions without any decisive role for a single person or a group of executives. Instead, based on the input provided by participants, a smart contract executes the transactions.\n\nDirect transactions between users on the blockchain eliminate any need for DEXs to act as intermediaries. As trades get executed on top of the blockchain network via a smart contract, every transaction incurs a fee along with the trading fee. This is, however, less than what one incurs on centralized exchanges. Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs do not take custody of users\u2019 funds, so the end-user always controls their digital assets.\n\nTo execute a transaction on a DEX, one needs to connect their cryptocurrency wallet to the exchange. However, DEXs don\u2019t allow buying Bitcoin with fiat currency, so one needs to transfer another cryptocurrency for Bitcoin. Transactions can be conducted without fulfilling KYC requirements. While transactions on DEXs might be anonymous for now, they could be brought into the regulatory ecosystem as it evolves.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin via SIP in India\n\nA systematic investment plan is a disciplined approach to regularly invest a fixed amount in assets at predefined intervals. SIP allows one to keep buying Bitcoin consistently over a predefined period. SIPs have been a fundamental component of conventional market instruments, including stocks and mutual funds. Thanks to SIPs, investors can capitalize on market fluctuations while retaining their portfolios for a long time.\n\nTo invest in SIPs, one needs to download the app of a service provider offering SIPs, complete the registration and KYC procedures, and select the relevant option on the screen. The next step is to choose the coin one wants to invest in (in this case, BTC), set the day and frequency of the plan, and start the SIP.\n\nHow to make direct P2P crypto transactions in India\n\nTo conduct direct peer-to-peer crypto transactions, one can opt for either on-exchange or off-exchange methods. On-exchange transactions involve using a P2P service on a crypto exchange platform where users register, complete identity verification (KYC), and then browse and initiate transactions with other users. The platform holds the cryptocurrency in escrow until both parties confirm the transaction.\n\nOff-exchange or OTC transactions require finding a trusted buyer or seller, often through personal networks or OTC brokers, and directly agreeing on transaction terms. Payment is usually made via bank transfer or digital wallets, and the cryptocurrency is transferred directly to the receiver\u2019s wallet. In both methods, it\u2019s important to prioritize security and adhere to local regulations.\n\nDirect P2P cryptocurrency transactions can be conducted through the exchanges that facilitate the buying and selling of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly between individuals, offering various payment options, including bank transfers and online wallets.\n\nThey typically charge low trading fees, provide noncustodial wallets, and use escrow services to enhance security. With features like auto-matching and multiple payment methods, these exchanges cater to diverse needs while ensuring user safety and minimizing the risk of fraud and hacks in the P2P crypto market.\n\nModes of payment for cryptocurrency transactions in India\n\nCrypto exchanges in India allow one to transfer money using bank transfer (debit card or credit card) via Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Unified Payments Interface (UPI). When conducting P2P trading, the seller might take payments in any mode they prefer, along with regular IMPS and UPI. These modes include regular Paytm, a digital payment service, and Lightning UPI, fast real-time transactions on Paytm with a single click without a PIN.\n\nOne can also pay for BTC using other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether (ETH), Polkadot\u2019s DOT (DOT) and Cardano (ADA), though many sellers prefer using stablecoins, such as USDT and USD Coin (USDC). However, buying Bitcoin via PayPal is not supported in India yet.\n\nMethods to store Bitcoin\n\nAfter buying Bitcoin, the next step is to store it securely. One can choose from several types of Bitcoin wallets, such as desktop wallets, mobile wallets, online wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets. Many buyers leave their Bitcoin with the exchange, which may not be suitable because the exchange holds the cryptocurrency and not the buyer.\n\nHardware wallets and paper wallets store Bitcoin offline, making it safe from thieves, though one still has to be careful not to lose the private key or the paper wallet itself. Mobile wallets have the advantage of convenience, and one can carry their BTC around and use it the way they want at any time. Desktop and online wallets typically offer a level of security comparable to keeping Bitcoin on an exchange.\n\nWallets can also be categorized as custodial or noncustodial. When storing funds in custodial wallets, users have no control over their private keys, and funds lie in the custody of a third party. In contrast, noncustodial wallets give users complete control over their private keys and, subsequently, their funds.\n\nBitcoin regulations in India\n\nIndian law requires anyone who has made gains from trading virtual digital assets (VDAs), including Bitcoin, to pay tax at a rate of 30% plus 4% cess, a tax levied on the tax for spending on a specific purpose. When buying Bitcoin on an Indian exchange, the onus to ensure compliance is on the exchange.\n\nHowever, when buying BTC on an international exchange or conducting a P2P transaction where BTC exchanges hands, the buyer and seller must ascertain that compliance requirements are met.\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin in India?\n\nAlthough purchasing Bitcoin in India presents possible investment prospects, careful thought must be given. Regulatory uncertainties exist despite the legality of cryptocurrencies. Decision-making is impacted by variables such as market volatility, a lack of detailed guidelines and prospective policy changes.\n\nAccessibility via exchanges that facilitate rupee transfers is a benefit; however, there are still restrictions on some payment options. It\u2019s critical to assess one\u2019s own risk tolerance, comprehend market dynamics, and stay current on regulatory changes.\n\nEven though Bitcoin offers opportunities for investing, careful consideration and knowledge of India\u2019s changing cryptocurrency scene are necessary before making any decisions.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

Source: CoinGlass\n\nEven this month has produced 15% gains so far \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s best December since 2020 \u2014 despite not repeating the breakout beyond all-time highs seen at the time.\n\nComing after its longest-ever bear market, this renaissance has been music to the ears of long-term holders, who, as Cointelegraph reported, have stubbornly refused to sell BTC.\n\nThis behavior has endured despite the \u201cup-only\u201d nature of the year\u2019s price performance, with upside tempered by only modest consolidations.\n\n\u201cOne of the standout features of the 2023 market has been the remarkably shallow depth of all price pullbacks and corrections,\u201d on-chain analytics firm Glassnode wrote in the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d on Dec. 19.\n\n\u201cHistorically, periods of bear market recovery, and bull market uptrends for BTC regularly see at least -25% pullbacks from the local high, with many examples exceeding -50%. However, the deepest correction in 2023 closed just -20% below the local high, suggesting that buy-side support, and the overall supply and demand balance has been favourable all year.\u201d\n\nBitcoin bull market corrections annotated chart (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nThat \u201cfavorable\u201d climate has led all Bitcoin investor cohorts back to aggregate profitability, yet as Glassnode notes, this is not so high as to spark mass selling and risk an uptrend breakdown.\n\nExamining the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric, researchers showed that profitability currently echoes mid-2019, when Bitcoin saw a mid-cycle high.\n\n\u201cThe NUPL metric for each cohort is not yet at euphoric highs, but is also comfortably above the respective cohort break-even level,\u201d they summarized.\n\nBitcoin NUPL annotated chart (screenshot).

Markets Closed, Merry Christmas! - Monday\n\n\n\n2. Initial Jobless Claims - Thursday\n\n\n\n3. Pending Home Sales data - Thursday\n\n\n\n4.

Months of U.S. data have fed the narrative of declining inflation with barely any exceptions.\n\nNow, the Federal Reserve faces the question of when to begin unwinding interest rate hikes \u2014 a move known as a \u201cpivot\u201d \u2014 and how fast.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, bets on the move\u2019s timing include as early as next month, while the Fed itself has played down such odds.\n\nPer data from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, markets remain unconvinced that officials will lower rates at the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, on Jan. 31.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart.

Source: BTC.com\n\nAccording to data from monitoring resource BTC.com, mining difficulty is due to hit yet more all-time highs at its next adjustment, this not due until early January. The latest adjustment saw nearly 7% added \u2014 the fourth-highest uptick of 2023, taking difficulty to 72 trillion.\n\nThe same is true of hash rate, as miners deploy ever more processing power amid a surge in profitability.\n\nRevenue collected via transaction fees by bitcoin miners averaged nearly $2,000,000 per day in 2023.

Source: Glassnode\n\nSome commentators argue that miners are seeking to hoard BTC into the halving, which will immediately cut the reward per block by 50%.\n\nFor Glassnode lead on-chain analyst Checkmate, however, there is a sobering lesson amid the apparent miner comeback.\n\nThe golden era for accumulating BTC was years ago, he lamented last week, revealing that he bought in at the exact top of the 2017 bull market.\n\nMy claim to fame is I bought the exact top of #Bitcoin in 2017. My buy was so bad, that the extra Coinbase fee applied for AUD at the time put my bid above the top tick of the top candle.\n\n\n\nMy pain hardly compares to that of miners.\n\n\n\nSince 2017, mining Difficulty is up 4,130%, and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/vN5edmMXuf \u2014 _Check\u0271ate \u26a1\u2622\ufe0f\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) December 23, 2023\n\nGreedy for gains this Christmas\n\nDespite the slower pace of BTC price gains toward the end of the year, the average investor is increasingly guided by a sense of greed.\n\nRelated: Price analysis 12/22: BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, ADA, AVAX, DOGE, DOT, LINK\n\nThis is the final conclusion of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, the popular sentiment gauge that looks set to round out 2023 at levels seen during Bitcoin\u2019s $69,000 all-time high two years ago.\n\nAt 73/100 as of Dec. 25, the Index, which uses a basket of factors to compute the average mindset across the crypto investor base, is firmly in its \u201cgreed\u201d bracket.\n\nCrypto Fear & Greed Index (screenshot). Source: Alternative.me\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, sustainability of the bull market as viewed through the lens of Fear & Greed should not pose a problem just yet. Throughout past price cycles, only readings above 90/100 have market macro market turnarounds.\n\nWith November 2021 being a conspicuous exception, the question for hodlers now is a classic one: Is this time different?\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
