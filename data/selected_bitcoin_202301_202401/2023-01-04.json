        "content": "00:00\n\nWhat do you think about the situation, especially in the last two months, essentially, that we find Bitcoin in, it hasn't budged since like November 8th, stuck around sixteen thousand and change. Why this incredible lack of volatility? This is true, but I'm just looking at the graph. You know, the big graph. Abigail, your correspondent, was showing just before the break, it was it was really fascinating when you look at it on that big scale like that, because you see what we've been pointing out for years and years, which is that you get these big trends with crept up and down and up and down these big waves that last for a few years and then back down and then another one and another one. And you know, we can't go on forever and ever. Right. We're not gonna be sitting here in hundreds of years time with with the same kind of pattern of waves. But it has held firm really well so far and is reflected in a really interesting report I read from the man group just before Christmas, which showed that a trend following strategy performed on Bitcoin and a theorem has outperformed buy and hold. It's been extremely effective. Really? That's what I've been doing for years and years. I buy as each new trend begins. And then once there's all the froth. And you always know when you're at the frothy time because everybody is going crazy about crypto. And that's the time I always start to think about selling. And, you know, so far that has worked several times in a row, as I say. You can't be sure that it will continue to work forever. But so far, always the waves. OK. So once we get out of this period of status, is it more likely we get a break to the up or downside, in your view? Glenn? Well, look, we can't definitively say that we've had the very last bit of downward movement, certainly loads of old chain data and and the various indicators that we use to try and see where we are in a cycle are telling us that we are pretty much at the bottom. But I know from past experience that even when the indicators tell you you're at the bottom, you might get one more lurch downwards. I mean, we've got a huge lurch downwards. You might remember, in 2020, just before the bull market began, because the pandemic caused everybody to panic and everybody rushed out of stocks and crypto. But then they rushed back into crypto in the big, big bull market began. So, yeah, as I say, you can't rule out another lurch downwards. But as I say, as a trend follower, I tend to wait until I see, you know, really clear signs that we're back at the beginning of an upward trend. For example, my personal account, I didn't really start buying until we got to about ten thousand dollars. And in 2020, the price had previously gone as low as I think about what was it, three or four thousand dollars? So I waited quite a while. I missed quite a lot of upside, but gotten with plenty more upside to go, of course. Glenn, what do you refer to? They they were rushing out and then rushing back into crypto. Who realistically are we talking about or are we talking about retail or are we talking about institutions? Is there still institutional buy in after all of the turmoil we have seen? There's no love of institutional buying right now, but I can pretty much guarantee that there will be again, simply because it's on their menu now. It's on their radar. And the report that I mentioned from Man Group here, of course, is huge asset manager was was very positive about the idea of crypto as an asset class. And the report even suggested actually that if you don't invest in crypto in the longer term, then you are in a sense exposed to it in a negative way. Because companies that you are exposed to might be pushed out of the market eventually by crypto will block chain based competitors. So, you know, that report was suggesting that that you kind of need to have exposure. I hope I'm not paraphrasing them too much, but that was what I took from it. Glenn, is it important to get regulation, you know, for for crypto or Bitcoin specifically because this crypto currency, it felt like was invented to circumvent that kind of centralized government control? Like, do we even want it? I want to see a lot more skepticism generally during the bull phase. I mean, we're never short of skepticism during the bad phases. But some people like the next guy that you've got coming on, Stephen Dale, who is kind of shouting about the negatives during the bull market. Nobody was listening to him then. They're all listening to him now, of course. But it's too late for that during the bull phases. We need people to look at things like Luna when you have 20 percent yields being offered on people's money. You know, I was looking at that at the time. People were asking me about it and I was thinking about something very suspicious. I don't know if there's a problem with the code, but 20 percent yield, you know, if it's in traditional finance, you would start asking serious questions. And the same needs to happen in crypto. People just shouldn't get too overexcited on the upside."
