They're on pace to end the week down more than 8% and 9%, respectively.\n\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Jane Street and Jump Crypto, two of the biggest crypto market makers, will take a step back from crypto trading in the U.S. as the country's regulators continue their crackdown on the nascent industry. CNBC's \"Crypto World\" reached out to the firms. Jane Street declined to comment, and Jump did not respond.\n\n\"In general, we're going to see much larger swings in price both ways since so many large market makers have significantly reduced providing,\" said David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets.\n\n\"Larger market makers create more stability in prices due to the liquidity they provide,\" he added. \"You'll see more frequent gaps up and down since order books are thinner in general.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin prices slid on Friday morning in Asia to below US$27,000 amid concerns about shrinking liquidity and congestion on the network that are driving up transaction costs. Ether fell below support at US$1,800 as all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies retreated. Polygon\u2019s Matic led the losers. U.S. equity futures edged up as economic data on Thursday indicated inflation is slowing, raising optimism the Federal Reserve may halt its interest rate hikes in June.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin network buckles under weight of BRC-20\u2019s runaway success\n\nBitcoin, Ether fall to monthly lows\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin slid 2.13% to US$26,974 in the 24 hours to 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, losing 6.63% for the week. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fell to US$26,781 at one stage on Thursday, the lowest price since March 28.\n\nCongestion on the Bitcoin blockchain is fueling the slide, with a backlog of waiting transactions reaching almost 300,000 on Friday morning, over six times higher than the number on May 9. That was when the BRC-20 token standard was introduced to allow the minting of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network and generated a surge in activity, according to data from blockchain researcher Jochen Hoenicke.\n\nThe jump in transaction volumes has raised concerns among Bitcoin developers. Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin code contributor, emailed the Bitcoin developer community on Monday to suggest blocking the transactions of BRC-20 tokens, which \u201cthreaten the smooth and normal use of the Bitcoin network as a peer-to-peer digital currency.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s drop also comes amid rising concerns about liquidity. Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto, two of the world\u2019s leading market makers, are reportedly quitting digital asset trading in the U.S., according to a Bloomberg report on Wednesday.\n\nEther fell 2.34% to US$1,795, posting a weekly loss of 4.45%. The token dropped to US$1,774 on early Friday, the lowest price since April 3.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Beacon Chain of the Ethereum Network briefly stopped validating transactions on early Friday morning, with Ethereum developers tweeting later that the outage had been resolved and the cause still under investigation.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower. Polygon\u2019s Matic token led the losers, dropping 3.75% to US$0.8406 and retreating 14.45% for the week. The token logged a low of US$0.8332 earlier today, the lowest price since January 8, 2023.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 2.11% in the past 24 hours to US$1.12 trillion. The total trading volume dropped 17.87% to US$37.67 billion.\n\nNFT index dips, Ethereum sales slide after Milady hype\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.42% to 3,394.50 in the 24 hours to 10:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 7.14% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain fell 47.62% in the past 24 hours to US$17.65 million, as the hype for Millady Maker NFT collection faded. Sales of Millady Maker dropped 86.53% to US$1.01 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nNFT trading is slowing due to the recent memecoin hype, with very few new users entering the space, according to Eric Dettman, NFT advisor at CryptoSlam. NFT buyers on the Ethereum blockchain totaled 45,298 in the past seven days, a drop of 72.97%.\n\nMemecoins are also losing steam. The price of Ordi, the memecoin that accounts for more than 60% of the total market cap of BRC-20 tokens, has slid 31.43% in the past 24 hours, according to blockchain data tracker BRC-20.io.\n\nEquity futures gain on slowing inflation data\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures rose as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.07%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.14%. And the Nasdaq Composite futures added 0.25%. The three U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular trading on Thursday on investor concerns about banking risks.\n\nThe U.S. producer price index (PPI) in April logged an annual increase of 2.3%, lower than predictions of 2.4% and the slowest pace since January 2021, according to Reuters on Thursday.\n\nU.S. initial jobless claims rose to 264,000 in the week ending May 6, beating expectations and reaching the highest level since October 2021, according to a Thursday Bloomberg report. Together with the PPI, the data points to a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged in June.\n\nOn U.S. banks, PacWest Bancorp shares fell more than 20% on Thursday, after the California-based lender said its deposits declined approximately 9.5% in the week ending May 5, sparking new concerns about the banking industry after a series of failures at lenders this year.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and top lawmakers postponed Friday talks on raising the U.S. debt ceiling to early next week, according to CNN on Thursday, with the negotiations making little progress so far.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will decide on June 14 its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 87.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 12.9% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, up from 3.9% on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)\n\nSee related article: Japan looks to regain its place in the cryptocurrency world pecking order"

        "content": "Carrollton, Texas, --News Direct-- Allied Energy Corporation\n\nAllied Energy Corp (OTC: AGYP), a producing oil and gas company focused on the leasing and reworking of oil and gas reserves in one of the most prolific hydrocarbon area in the United States, is pleased to provide a shareholder update regarding the Company's activities partnering with Enerhash USA at the Thiel Well site in an effort to begin flare gas bitcoin mining.\n\nOn April 26th, CEO George Monteith of Allied Energy received a revised field build out report distributed by Enerhash's personal.\n\nDue to circumstances beyond the Company's control, initial target dates for the Thiel site had to be adjusted. At this time the Company is confident that all challenges have been overcome regarding the initial delays. The Company is pleased with the revised timeline and is thankful to report that thus far everything is proceeding according to plan. To date the following work has been completed:\n\nOperating permits - completed\n\nSite survey - completed\n\nSite planning - completed\n\nElevation study - completed\n\nContractor proposal for site buildout - completed\n\nAllied will update their shareholders as further developments occur with press releases and media updates on Twitter.\n\nThe initial Thiel project, if all goes as planned, is expected to take 8-10 weeks to complete. The generators and data centers will be located 150 feet south of the wellhead. A meter run will be installed just north of the generator pad. The existing water tank will be reused for discharge from the separator. The elevated pad will be constructed of compacted engineered fill to support generator weights up to 60,000 lbs. per generator and 20,000 lbs. per data center. A reinforced concrete pad will be constructed on top of the compacted engineered fill to support the generator / generators. The contractor will provide two 3-inch electrical conduits with sweeping connections from the generators to each data center pad.\n\nStory continues\n\nAllied CEO George Monteith commented: \"The Thiel is the first location where Allied will establish a bitcoin mining footprint in partnership with Enerhash. At this time, we believe that the Thiel site will be a 3-megawatt center and power three containers of bitcoin mining equipment. As per our last release investors / current shareholders can see that we are laying a broader foundation of gas well resources through our new partnership with Sloan Petroleum. Ultimately, we are focused on completing the initial 20-megawatt project with Enerhash to then set our sights toward completion of the 100-megawatt project. I am appreciative of all the hard work my team has given, we have a detailed plan and the resources to make it happen, now it is time to make the push toward mining digital currency.\"\n\nAbout Enerhash:\n\nEnerhash is an energy technology and digital infrastructure development company founded by European energy experts in 2019. Enerhash has developed projects on three continents providing renewable energy optimization and grid balancing services including New Zealand, Sweden, Hungary and now they are entering into the USA.\n\nEnerhash USA will align with energy producers as a solution to help alleviate harmful methane emissions caused by production. These solutions will monetize wasted natural gas resources to reduce emissions by eliminating routine flaring to reach ESG goals and unlock the value from stranded resources. To discover more about Enerhash USA, visit their corporate website at www.enerhashusa.com.\n\nAbout AGYP:\n\nAllied Energy Corp. is an energy development and production company acquiring oil & gas reserves in some of the most prolific hydrocarbon bearing regions of the United States. The Company specializes in the business of reworking & re-completing 'existing' oil & gas wells located in the thousands of mature oil & gas producing fields across the United States. The Company applies its knowledge, experience, and effective well-remediation technologies to achieve higher production volumes, longer well life, and more efficient recovery of the proven and available oil and gas reserves in the fields/projects in which it has acquired an ownership interest. The Company will utilize updated technologies such as hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\"), drilling of lateral (\"horizontal\") legs in productive zones, and utilizing new cased hole electric logging to locate bypassed pays, all to enhance daily rates and oil & gas recoveries. By acquiring interests in a growing number of selected projects in various regions, Allied Energy Corp. is diversifying its exposure and effectively minimizing risk as it pursues corporate growth, top line & bottom-line revenues to the benefit of all stakeholders. There are proven, recoverable reserves contained in the many aging oil & gas fields that have been bypassed by companies moving away from these fields in search of deeper, more plentiful, but more costly reserves. The Company plans to concentrate on bypassed oil and gas as there is less competition and, as mentioned above, the costs are considerably less. Additionally, the company will acquire interests in marginal wells that can be acquired at minimal cost, of which there are 420,000 wells in the U.S. Quoting Barry Russell, President of the Independent Petroleum Association of America (\"IPAA\") - \"With approximately 20 percent of American oil production and 10 percent of American natural gas production coming from marginal wells, they are America's true strategic petroleum reserve.\"\n\nSafe Harbor Statement:\n\nThis Press Release may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
