        "title": "Thinking About Getting a Loan With Your Bitcoin? You'll Want to Read This First - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Investors are discovering new ways to put their Bitcoin (BTC -2.59%) holdings to use as the cryptocurrency becomes more widely accepted in the financial world. One such option is to use Bitcoin as collateral to secure a loan.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to move forward, there is a growing desire among holders to access the asset's liquidity without having to sell it. However, investors interested in obtaining a Bitcoin-backed loan will quickly realize that there are significant differences compared to traditional loans.\n\nHere's a detailed overview of what these loans entail to help investors make more informed decisions about Bitcoin-backed loans and the various options available.\n\nGeneral differences\n\nLike any other loan, the total value of the loan holders can obtain depends on the amount of collateral they can offer. Loans on some other assets, like some mortgage products with real estate as collateral, offer up to 97% loan-to-value (LTV), meaning they only need to offer up to 3% of the total loan as collateral. However, Bitcoin's extreme price volatility means that those seeking to leverage their holdings will face more stringent borrowing terms.\n\nActual conditions vary between lenders and depend on market conditions, but it isn't uncommon for Bitcoin loans to require LTV ratios as high as 50%. Under these circumstances, a potential borrower with $500,000 in Bitcoin could only borrow up to $250,000. Compare this to a prospective home buyer looking for a mortgage, where one might be able to borrow $485,000 toward a $500,000 home, assuming they meet specific criteria.\n\nNot only do Bitcoin loan borrowers have to pledge more collateral, but the interest rates tied to these loans are generally much higher. While the average mortgage interest rate hovers around 8% today, Bitcoin borrowers should generally expect rates to be even higher than this, at times up to 15%.\n\nAvailable options\n\nClearly, there are distinct differences to consider when looking to obtain Bitcoin-collateralized loans. But sometimes, personal conditions or financial goals warrant exploring Bitcoin loans. For those interested, there are two main routes to obtain Bitcoin loans: Centralized and decentralized lenders.\n\nCentralized lending platforms provide a more traditional approach to obtaining loans using Bitcoin as collateral. These platforms, operated by a centralized authority such as a company or bank, are usually more straightforward and accessible. Typically, users can choose to receive loans in fiat currency or in stablecoins. The advantages of centralized lenders include a less complicated process, higher loan amounts compared to decentralized platforms, and potential access to a broader range of assets for borrowing. Popular centralized options include Unchained Capital, Binance, and Bitfinex.\n\nHowever, the centralized platforms aren't without their risks. During the recent crypto winter and market volatility hit, multiple crypto lenders became insolvent, ultimately putting borrowers' assets at risk.\n\nDecentralized Bitcoin loans, facilitated through decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchains like Stacks or Wrapped Bitcoin, offer an alternative to collateralize Bitcoin without having to trust or rely on a centralized intermediary. By locking up Bitcoin, users can generate a loan in stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. This method substantially reduces counterparty risk, as the process is managed by smart contracts, providing transparency and security.\n\nLike the centralized platforms, there are some drawbacks with DeFi lenders. The interest rates on DeFi loans are often not fixed and can be highly volatile. Additionally, the DeFi space can be complex, potentially posing challenges for less experienced users.\n\nFinal considerations\n\nFor investors seeking swift access to liquidity without triggering taxable events, Bitcoin loans can present a valuable financial opportunity. However, as with any financial decision, careful consideration of individual circumstances and alignment with personal goals is crucial.\n\nWhether people are opting for centralized lenders with their established systems or decentralized platforms offering alternatives, understanding the collateralization process, loan terms, and associated risks like interest rates and potential smart contract vulnerabilities is paramount. Ultimately, the decision to leverage Bitcoin as collateral for loans demands a balance between financial objectives and risk tolerance."

        "content": "Visa is Bringing Bitcoin Pollution Everywhere You Want to Be\n\nVisa is just about everywhere with its credit and debit card offerings accepted by millions of merchants around the globe and used by millions of people to make their daily purchases. Now, the world\u2019s largest payment processor is also exploring new ways for customers and businesses to use Bitcoin.\n\nVisa is just about everywhere with its credit and debit card offerings accepted by millions of merchants around the globe and used by millions of people to make their daily purchases. Now, the world\u2019s largest payment processor is also exploring new ways for customers and businesses to use Bitcoin. This support for Bitcoin contradicts the company\u2019s stated commitments to sustainability and reducing climate warming emissions because Bitcoin is an electricity hog, often powered by dirty energy. Bitcoin operations could become even worse due to adoption driven by Visa\u2019s new services.\n\nWhile Visa has extensive expertise on cryptocurrencies, the company is not putting those resources to work on cleaning up Bitcoin\u2019s pollution and climate impacts despite making strong corporate climate action pledges.\n\nHelping Grow Bitcoin\u2019s Pollution\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is primarily a speculative investment in which people bet on whether its price goes up or down. With support from Visa and other large financial services companies, that could change. Visa is making it easier for people to buy, trade, and spend bitcoin which is vital for the cryptocurrencies growth and its actual use for transactions. Visa is collaborating with crypto exchanges to let people buy their morning cup of coffee or weekly groceries using bitcoin. For example, people in the U.S. who store bitcoin in a Coinbase wallet can spend it at any merchant in Visa\u2019s vast network thanks to a card issued in partnership with Coinbase.\n\nMore widespread use and greater demand means a higher bitcoin price, which has historically contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s enormous energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. [1] Here\u2019s why: when the price of bitcoin is high, there is incentive for \u201cminers\u201d to employ more computing power and electricity in the digital guessing game to win new bitcoin and fees.\n\nMuch of Bitcoin\u2019s electricity use is generated by fossil fuels: 62% globally according to estimates from Cambridge University researchers. And dirty coal is the largest single source.\n\nBitcoin miners using more energy also puts more demand on often-strained electrical grids and uses energy that could be directed towards other socially necessary uses including the rapid expansion of electrification that is needed to address the climate crisis.\n\nPutting Dirty Bitcoin in Your Wallet\n\nVisa is one of several large financial services companies leading the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nVisa has multiple crypto-linked credit and debit cards that enable customers to spend and earn rewards in bitcoin. One such card is offered in partnership with Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States. The Coinbase card automatically converts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to US Dollars at point of sale with any retailer in Visa\u2019s network. Customers can also earn reward points in bitcoin. Visa also partnered with Crypto.com, another large crypto exchange company, to support a prepaid card that customers can load with bitcoin. This joins other bitcoin rewards debit cards like the one offered by Fold in collaboration with Visa which has reportedly rewarded over $30 million in bitcoin since launching in 2020.\n\nConcerningly, Visa is also expanding its crypto offerings around the world despite mounting evidence of Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact. The company recently launched a debit card in collaboration with EU crypto exchange Lama that allows customers to spend their bitcoin. Visa created a long-term strategic partnership with Wirex, a crypto platform and exchange company, to expand in the United Kingdom and Asia-Pacific by offering crypto debit and prepaid cards.\n\nPartnerships with crypto companies and products that enable using bitcoin have created a growing business for Visa. In the first quarter of 2022, Visa reported that customers made $2.5 billion worth of purchases on their Visa crypto cards. The company said its network of crypto wallet partners grew from 54 to 65 by early 2022, including Coinbase, Circle, and BlockFi, and that almost 100 million merchants now accept crypto, including bitcoin, on the Visa network. In February 2023, Visa leaders denied a Reuters report claiming the company was pausing new crypto partnerships and services, and reaffirmed that the company was still moving forward into the crypto sector.\n\nVisa also helps other companies adopt cryptocurrencies. And because Bitcoin has the largest market cap of any cryptocurrency, this certainly includes Bitcoin. Visa\u2019s Digital Currency Innovation Hub assists clients in understanding cryptocurrencies and creating new business opportunities and products. Visa\u2019s crypto consulting and advisory services help clients, like financial institutions and retailers, navigate the complex and changing cryptocurrency landscape. The hub also publishes public educational materials on crypto and blockchain technologies.\n\nBitcoin Reveals Visa\u2019s Climate Hypocrisy\n\nVisa has committed to reaching net zero by 2040, in line with the goals set by the Paris Climate Agreement. To accomplish this, Visa has set science based emissions reductions targets to meet a 1.5 C pathway that many see as necessary for avoiding the worst of the climate catastrophe. Visa also says the company embeds sustainability into its partnerships and initiatives, principles the company does not appear to be applying in its Bitcoin-related partnerships. Visa also offers products to increase public awareness of climate change, such as a CO2 calculator for customers to track emissions from their purchases. Yet, Visa has not done anything to account for emissions from bitcoin transactions even though researchers find that bitcoin transactions have a much larger carbon footprint than transactions using US Dollars and other traditional government-issued currencies.\n\nVisa needs to work on cleaning up Bitcoin or stop growing its Bitcoin-related services. Publicly acknowledging Bitcoin\u2019s climate problems is the first step. This is an opportunity for Visa to lead the financial services sector on climate change, sustainability, and technological innovation. We need companies like Visa to send a powerful message to Bitcoin adopters that the technology needs to innovate to align with climate goals.\n\nCryptocurrencies can operate using cleaner technologies, and with the support and creativity of companies like Visa, we can future-proof Bitcoin against a warming world.\n\nNotes"
