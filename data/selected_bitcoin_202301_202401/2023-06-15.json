        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nCryptocurrency prices fell after the Federal Reserve's June meeting, with bitcoin falling below $25,000 for the first time since March.\n\nOn Thursday, bitcoin was lower by more than 1% at $25,439.77, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it fell as low as $24,766.52. Ether fell more than 3% to $1,667.56.\n\nAltcoins tumbled too. Solana's token was down 2.3%, Polygon's fell 8.3% and Cardano's lost %3.5.\n\nAnd selling pressure weighed on Tether (USDT), which lost its peg to the U.S. dollar on most exchanges Thursday, falling to 99 cents in its biggest drop since November.\n\nBitcoin cut most of its Thursday morning losses in the afternoon as traders mulled the possibility of the first spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., following a CoinDesk report that BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is close to filing an application for a bitcoin ETF. The report was light on detail, however, and didn't specify how it would get exposure \u2014 whether by tracking spot bitcoin or bitcoin futures.\n\nThe initial slide began late Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve ended its June meeting and decided to leave interest rates unchanged for now, but said two more may be in store by yearend.\n\nFor cryptocurrencies, \"this has little to do with the FOMC, and more to do with thinner liquidity and weak sentiment,\" said Michael Safai, managing partner at Dexterity Capital. \"Given how thin trading volumes are at the moment, a sizable (but not massive) sell order is enough to set off liquidations.\"\n\n\"Traders are more inclined to keep their money off the table in the midst of this regulatory backlash, especially when it comes to altcoins, so there isn't going to be much new capital flowing in to buoy prices so readily,\" he added."

        "title": "BlackRock files for spot bitcoin ETF, with Coinbase as a crypto custodian - CNBC",
        "content": "Asset management giant BlackRock took the first steps Thursday to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which has long been a point of contention between crypto advocates and federal regulators.\n\nThe firm filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust. If approved, the ETF would allow easy access for investors to get exposure to crypto in a product from one of Wall Street's largest companies.\n\n\"The Shares are intended to constitute a simple means of making an investment similar to an investment in bitcoin rather than by acquiring, holding and trading bitcoin directly on a peer-to-peer or other basis or via a digital asset exchange,\" the filing said.\n\nThe SEC has so far resisted allowing the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The regulator is currently in a legal battle with Grayscale over whether the firm will be allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. A decision in that case is expected later this year.\n\nSeveral other firms have filed and later pulled applications to launch spot bitcoin funds. If the SEC relents, there could be a flood of those products on the market.\n\nETFs typically take months to launch after an initial filing, if they ever begin trading. The proposed BlackRock fund will likely face heavy resistance from the SEC, and the filing could be pulled before an ETF is ever launched, said Aisha Hunt, principal at asset management law firm Kelley Hunt & Charles.\n\nBlackRock's move comes during a time when crypto prices remain well below their all-time highs and the industry faces increasing scrutiny in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe SEC recently sued Coinbase and Binance for allegedly running unregistered securities exchanges. The SEC also accused Binance of commingling customer funds with its own.\n\nCoinbase is listed as the bitcoin custodian for the proposed BlackRock ETF. BlackRock has an existing strategic partnership with Coinbase. The companies announced last year that Aladdin, BlackRock's institutional investment platform, would be connected to Coinbase Prime for crypto trading and custody.\n\nThe SEC did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the new filing.\n\nThe entrance of BlackRock into the bitcoin ETF space could be a boost to a sector that has had a rocky start over the past two years.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs first launched in 2021, but the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) is the only one that has grown to a substantial size, with about $800 million in assets. The fund has lost more than 40% on a total return basis since the launch, according to FactSet. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high shortly after BITO launched and is down more than 60% since its peak."

        "title": "BlackRock delves deeper into crypto with push for bitcoin ETF - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nBlackRock pushed further into cryptocurrencies on Thursday by filing an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund.\n\nIf the SEC approves the application, the fund would trade on the Nasdaq stock market, making it the first publicly traded spot bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nThe $9tn money manager already runs a private spot bitcoin trust that it launched last year. The ETF marks a further expansion of its partnership with embattled crypto exchange Coinbase, which would be the custodian of the fund\u2019s bitcoin.\n\nThe launch of a spot bitcoin ETF by the world\u2019s largest money manager could be a shot in the arm for cryptocurrencies after a run of bad news including the collapse of FTX last year and the SEC\u2019s decision earlier this month to sue both Coinbase and the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, alleging securities violations.\n\nBut it is not clear that the SEC will approve BlackRock\u2019s application. It has already turned down several earlier proposals from other asset managers on the grounds that the tokens trade on unregulated exchanges with surveillance and manipulation risks.\n\nThe watchdog is being sued by Grayscale over its refusal to allow the conversion of what was then the world\u2019s largest crypto investment vehicle into a listed ETF. The lawsuit contends that the SEC\u2019s decision was arbitrary, particularly because it has allowed the launch of ETFs based on bitcoin futures.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s move also comes at a time when the SEC has proposed new custody rules that would place additional responsibilities on asset managers to make sure that customer assets are kept in properly segregated accounts.\n\nThe price of bitcoin is down more than 60 per cent from its 2021 peak, but it has also bounced significantly from the lows it hit last year after FTX went bust.\n\n\u201cBlackRock\u2019s increasing engagement shows Bitcoin continues to be an asset of interest for some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions,\u201d said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, which provides the bitcoin price that BlackRock plans to use.\n\n\u201cAn estimated 20 per cent of Americans have now owned bitcoin at some point. BlackRock\u2019s proposed ETF potentially offers the other 80 per cent an option that is altogether more familiar and accessible.\u201d\n\nBlackRock declined to comment beyond the filing. But founder Larry Fink, who was once openly sceptical of cryptocurrencies, wrote in his annual letter to investors in March that \u201cvery interesting developments are happening in the digital asset space . . . At BlackRock we continue to explore the digital assets ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAnd during its investor day earlier this week, executives touted the group\u2019s ability to launch new ETFs and offer clients a wide range of asset classes. It currently has more than 1,300 different ETFs."
