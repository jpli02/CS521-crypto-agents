        "content": "Bitcoin Mining Machines Moving to Russia Due to Saturation in US, Despite Sanctions\n\nRussia's Bitcoin Mining Market Is Rising\n\nRussia's Bitcoin mining market is booming, and hardware providers Bitmain and MicroBT are positioned to profit from the expansion.\n\nBecause of its access to inexpensive electricity and frigid temperature, Russia has long been a leader in terms of Bitcoin hash rate. Speaking at Consensus 2023, Ethan Vera, COO at mining services company Luxor Technologies, said that more equipment is entering Russia than any other country in the globe.\n\nAs China's mining industry was outlawed in 2021, Russia's mining market share increased, making it the second- or third-largest in the world.\n\nThere are no restrictions on Russia that entirely forbid participation in the mining industry, despite the fact that international sanctions were put in place as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and ongoing attacks on the nation.\n\nRussian miners have been encouraged to expand their operations by better mining economics, reduced regulatory oversight and taxes compared to the US and other countries, and low energy costs.\n\nDue to these factors, it will be the only nation that can significantly speed up the rise of hashrate, according to a report by mining company Cryptocurrency Mining Group (CMG)."

        "title": "BlackRock, Worldcoin, Ripple: Bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz dishes on crypto - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Bitcoin roars back after a year of crypto industry scandals and losses, Mike Novogratz says one man in particular gives him reason to stay bullish.\u201cThe most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink,\u201d Novogratz said, referring to the investment titan who is chief executive officer at BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s biggest asset manager.BlackRock thrilled the crypto community in June when it applied to launch an exchange-traded fund to track the spot price of Bitcoin \u2014 a move that, if approved, could potentially spark a new wave of investment in the cryptocurrency. But it was Fink\u2019s seeming conversion from crypto skeptic to Bitcoin believer \u2014 he now considers it an \u201cinternational asset\u201d \u2014 that really has Novogratz excited.\u201cHe got \u2018orange-pilled,\u2019 as we say. Orange pill is when you take a nonbeliever and you make them a believer in Bitcoin,\u201d Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings, told David Rubenstein in an interview this week for an upcoming episode of Bloomberg Wealth. \u201cLarry was a nonbeliever. Now he says, \u2018Hey, this is going to be a global currency.\u2019 People around the world all trust it.\u201dBlackRock\u2019s ETF push and Fink\u2019s evolving attitude are part of an \u201cadoption cycle\u201d that Novogratz said may help the coin top its all-time high of nearly $69,000 reached in 2021 \u2014 especially when it\u2019s accompanied by an eventual Federal Reserve pivot toward cutting rates. This week, Bitcoin hovered between $29,000 and $30,000 after soaring more than 70% year to date.Novogratz, in a wide-ranging conversation at Galaxy\u2019s offices in lower Manhattan, also said a recent ruling in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s case against Ripple Labs represented a \u201chuge victory\u201d for crypto, and touched on topics ranging from Sam Altman\u2019s eyeball-scanning Worldcoin project to Galaxy\u2019s commitment to keeping a presence in New York.One of the most vocal crypto advocates from Wall Street, Novogratz, a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Fortress Investment Group, first bought Bitcoin when it was trading at about $100. In 2018, he founded Galaxy Digital, which provides financial services such as trading, investment banking and asset management in the crypto industry.Novogratz\u2019s reputation took a hit last year when a crypto project he supported, the Luna token invented by South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon as part of an experiment in algorithmic stablecoins, blew up, triggering a series of collapses in the industry. The now-infamous tattoo on his arm \u2014 a wolf howling at the moon with the word \u201cLuna\u201d \u2014 serves as a \u201cgood reminder of hubris,\u201d Novogratz said.His advice today, for someone who has $100,000 to invest: \u201cIf they were young and had a high risk tolerance, I\u2019d be buying Alibaba stock. I\u2019d be buying silver, gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum. That\u2019d be my portfolio.\u201d Those with lower risk tolerance should put 30% in a portfolio like that and 70% in bonds and perhaps an index fund, he said.Asked if Worldcoin would take off, Novogratz said \u201cyou don\u2019t want to bet against Sam Altman right now.\u201d (Altman, co-founder of Worldcoin, is also behind the artificial intelligence sensation ChatGPT.) Worldcoin uses a small device called an \u201corb\u201d to scan people\u2019s eyeballs in order to generate a a unique digital identity for online use. A token issued by the project more than doubled in value at launch this week, before retreating from those highs. It traded at $2.20 as of 6:30 p.m. on Friday in New York.\u201cI think the price potentially can go a lot higher, because there\u2019s an AI hype cycle,\u201d Novogratz said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will all use that as our identity.\u201dThis year, a flurry of enforcement actions by the SEC against the biggest crypto firms has rattled many in the industry. Novogratz said the recent court ruling in the SEC\u2019s suit against Ripple \u2014 the judge declared that Ripple\u2019s XRP token was a security in some instances but not in others \u2014 delivered a victory to the crypto industry because it proves that \u201cthe rules are nothing close to clear.\u201dAs for Galaxy itself, even as it moves parts of its business offshore, it remains committed to New York. \u201cI don\u2019t see us not being in the US or being in New York,\u201d Novogratz said.To see the full interview with Novogratz, watch Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein on Tuesday Aug. 8 at 9 p.m. NY time on Bloomberg Television."
