        "content": "The new year has pumped new life into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAfter a dismal 2022, Bitcoin has come roaring out of the starting gate in the first two weeks of the year gaining in 13 of the last 15 days.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rising more than 24% during that stretch to $20,728. That compares to the last 52 weeks in which bitcoin lost more than 54%.\n\nBitcoin was above $45,000 to start 2022, as the crypto industry started making inroads with politicians and mainstream financial institutions.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS LAUNCHING DIGITAL ASSET SUBCOMMITTEE AFTER TROUBLED YEAR FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY INDUSTRY\n\nThe year ended with bitcoin below $17,000.\n\nKeep in mind, bitcoin's all-time high was $67,802.30, reached in November 2021.\n\nA steady industry decline started in May with the collapse of Terra, a so-called stablecoin.\n\nInvestors lost tens of billions of dollars and a number of crypto companies faced financial ruin.\n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED DEFENDS HIMSELF IN ONLINE POST: 'I DIDN\u2019T STEAL FUNDS'\n\nMore companies have declared bankruptcy since, the biggest of all being the collapse of FTX and the arrest of the company's founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nTraditional markets have also been doing well with stocks finishing last week with the best weekly performance in two months as earnings season got underway and inflation numbers moved lower.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FOX BUSINESS' REAL-TIME CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICING DATA\n\nYear-to-date, the S&P is up 4% and the Nasdaq gained nearly 6%.\n\nEther, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, is at $1,583, a gain of nearly 23% in the past week.\n\nEven the smaller dogecoin has rallied more than 20% in the past week to 8 cents.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

A new bull run is unlikely in 2023.\n\nHowever, experts are looking to next year and beyond with optimism.\n\nIn 2022, the entire cryptocurrency market lost about $1.4 trillion in value with the industry facing liquidity issues and bankruptcies topped off by the collapse of exchange FTX. Contagion spread across the industry.\n\nWhile bitcoin has gotten a small bump at the start of the year, in line with risk assets like stocks, experts say bitcoin is unlikely to retest its all-time high of just under $69,000 but it may have bottomed.\n\n\"I think there's a little bit more downside, but I don't think there's going to be a lot,\" Bill Tai, a venture capitalist and crypto veteran told CNBC last week.\n\n\"There's a chance that [bitcoin] kind of has bottomed here,\" adding that it could fall as low as $12,000 before jumping back up.\n\nMeltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, said bitcoin is likely to be rangebound trading at the lower end between $15,000 and $20,000 and on the upper end between $25,000 to $30,000.\n\nShe said a lot of the \"forced selling\" that happened in 2022 as a result of collapses in the market is now over, but there isn't much new money coming into bitcoin.\n\n\"I don't think there's a lot of forced selling remaining, which is optimistic,\" Demirors told CNBC Friday. \"But again, I think the upside is quite limited, because we also don't see a lot of new inflows coming in.\"\n\nInvestors are also keeping one eye on the macroeconomic situation. Bitcoin has proved to be closely correlated to risk assets such as stocks, and in particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq . These assets are affected by changes in interest rates from the Federal Reserve and other macroeconomic moves.

        "title": "How I Introduced My Younger Sister To Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "For my sister\u2019s eighteenth birthday, I gave her the gift of bitcoin and some lessons on becoming a sovereign individual.\n\nThis is an opinion editorial by Santiago Varela, a bitcoin miner and writer from Mexico City.\n\nMy sister turned 18 years old in the beginning of 2023 and I gave her a very unusual gift during this holiday season. Because I love her, I truly believe that the best gift I can give her is the orange pill.\n\nIt all started with a letter that I wrote for her explaining the gift I was about to give her. Then, I handed her a copy of \u201cThe Bitcoin Standard\u201d by Saifedean Ammous and a hardware wallet. However, that was just the beginning of a long process that we had to go through together if I really wanted to orange pill her.\n\nOf course, I was well aware that her first reaction to my surprise wasn't going to include the typical face of an 18-year-old girl opening her presents on a joyful Christmas morning. At first, she seemed more confused than excited. I have no doubt that she was expecting some nice pair of shoes or a cool gadget. I'm sorry sis, but that's how we maximalists roll.\n\nIn the birthday/holiday letter, I pointed out three reasons why I was giving her this specific gift:\n\nI want to set her on the path to financial freedom I want her to be a sovereign woman in a fiat world where dishonest relationships have been normalized As a high school senior who doesn't know what she wants to study in college, she could benefit from Bitcoin which might give her some ideas for what she wants to do\n\nThe long process of orange pilling my sister began with a quote from the prologue of \u201cThe Bitcoin Standard,\u201d which I consider the perfect starting point. I asked her to read this quote over and over again before beginning the orange-pilling journey:\n\n\u201cThis book does not offerinvestment advice but aims at helping elucidate the economic properties of the network and its operation, to provide readers an informed understanding of bitcoin before deciding whether they want to use it. Only with such an understanding, and only after extensive and thorough research into the practical operational aspects of owning and storing bitcoins, should anyone consider holding value in bitcoin. While bitcoin\u00b4s rise in market value may make it appear like a no-brainer as an investment, a closer look at the myriad hacks, attacks, scams, and security failures that have cost people their bitcoins provides a sobering warning to anyone who thinks that owning bitcoins provides a guaranteed profit. Should you come out of reading this book thinking that the bitcoin currency is something worth owning, your first investment should not be in buying bitcoins, but in time spent understanding how to buy, store, and own bitcoins securely. It is the inherent nature of bitcoin that such knowledge cannot be delegated or outsourced. There is no alternative to personal responsibility for anyone interested in using this network, and that is the real investment that needs to be made to get into bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, I told her that I would help her set up the hardware wallet and I would send her a little bit of bitcoin. To begin, I sent her $10 worth of bitcoin. But then, to make sure that she invested time into acquiring the basic, necessary knowledge and to make her understand the proof-of-work philosophy, I promised that I would send her $100 worth of bitcoin for every chapter of the book that she read. Therefore, I prepared a quiz for each chapter to verify that she really read carefully.\n\nHowever, as someone who is deep down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, I knew that making her read the book to stack sats on her hardware wallet wasn't enough. That was nothing, we were just getting started. So, what was next in the orange-pilling journey? Every time that I crossed by any opportunity, I tried to convert that moment into a little Bitcoin lesson.\n\nFor example, there was such an opportunity after my sister was assigned a project in her high school philosophy class. Knowing that I am a big fan of philosophy, she came to ask me for help. The project consisted of having a conversation with one of your family members but using the famous Socratic method for the conversation. If you don't know what that is, the Socratic method (named after Socrates) is \u201ca form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions.\u201d\n\nObviously, we had a dialogue about Bitcoin and money using the Socratic method.\n\nAnother thing I did in this orange-pilling journey was to show her a rabbit hole inside of the Bitcoin rabbit hole: bitcoin mining and energy. I love bitcoin mining and the energy aspects of Bitcoin. In fact, I love it so much that we have an ASIC in our garage. It wasn't really hard to make her grasp how passionate I am about home mining. Believe it or not, she had never even seen my ASIC (she had only heard the \u201cbrrrrrr\u201d). Consequently, I took her to the garage and she got some hands-on experience. I also have my Bitcoin and Lightning nodes in the garage. That was a lot of fun because with tools like Mempool.Space and LnVisualizer I was able to help her see the tangible side of Bitcoin. This is when I really felt that it all began to come together.\n\nAs you all likely know, knowledge about Bitcoin can\u2019t be delegated or outsourced. When it comes to Bitcoin, there is no alternative to personal responsibility. Although I\u2019ve told her that I\u2019d love to help her with anything, I can\u2019t guide her down the rabbit hole forever. You have to go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole by yourself. I guided her for a long time but the moment for her to embark on the journey for herself is here. Like Oscar Wilde once said: \u201cEducation is an admirable thing. But it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.\u201d\n\nSo, I began treating her like any other Bitcoin pleb out there and let her go down the rabbit hole by herself. The only thing I did was to send her a bunch of resources (articles, podcasts, videos, books, etc.) and let her go her own way. At the same time, I realized that I could do this with other kids that are about the same age as my sister. Even better, I realized that my sister could help me with this and introduce her digital-native friends to Bitcoin because, if you care about Bitcoin, you should onboard people individually.\n\nAccordingly, I\u2019ve decided to turn our garage into a little Bitcoin academy. Although my sister was the guinea pig for this experiment (and, as I am writing, she is the only student that has attended Bitcoin academy), I have to give a big shout out to other Bitcoiners around the world who have shared educational content for anyone to use. For example, Mi Primer Bitcoin (from El Salvador) has an amazing Bitcoin diploma workbook that anyone can download for free. I have no doubt that initiatives like theirs or like Escuelita Bitcoin in Uruguay are what we need if we want a future with sovereign individuals. We need to teach the young.\n\nHopefully, this inspires other Bitcoiners around the world to introduce their younger siblings to Bitcoin. I was inspired by initiatives like the ones mentioned above and by stories like the Denver middle schoolers who became Bitcoin entrepreneurs. With a little bit of luck, the next time I write an article for Bitcoin Magazine, it\u2019ll be about Mexico City middle schoolers who became Bitcoin entrepreneurs. For now, stay humble and stack sats my friends.\n\nThis is a guest post by Santiago Varela.
