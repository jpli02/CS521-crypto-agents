        "title": "Bitcoin climbs above $28,000 as investors shrug off regulatory crackdowns - CNBC",
        "content": "Bitcoin climbed sharply Wednesday as investors shrugged off initial fears surrounding U.S. regulators' crackdowns on industry giants and became willing to take some risk.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency rose 3.9% to $28,399.63, according to Coin Metrics. Bitcoin has retaken the $28,000 level after dipping below it on Monday following news that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission FTC's lawsuit against Binance. Earlier in the day it rose as high as $28,637.25.\n\nEther, the second-biggest digital coin, rose 1.7% to $1,808.29.\n\nBitcoin has been steadily rising this year after a brutal 2022 that saw collapses of major crypto exchanges and a sharp slump in prices. Investors have taken some comfort from the thought of a reversal in the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking moves, which put pressure on risk assets like stocks.\n\nThe reason for the jump Wednesday was not immediately clear. However, it comes amid a broad rise in U.S. stocks. Bitcoin has been known to follow movements in equity markets, with investors treating it like more of a traditional risk asset.\n\nU.S. regulators have sharpened their crackdown on crypto firms of late, with the CFTC suing Binance and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao for allegedly breaking trading rules by courting clients in the U.S. without authorization.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has also threatened to take legal action against Coinbase for alleged violations of securities rules.\n\n\"Broadly we are looking quite bullish here with Bitcoin reclaiming $28K and looking to target $30K next,\" Vijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC via email Wednesday.\n\n\"In general, when price action starts to absorb negative news this quickly, it indicates that the market is bullish and trending upward. The CFTC case against Binance, while quite important, doesn't seem to have affected the market that much.\"\n\nBitcoin had earlier gotten a boost from woes in the global banking system. Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse was recently rescued by its peer UBS in a government-backed, cut-price deal.\n\nU.S. tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank and crypto-oriented banks Silvergate and Signature have also failed.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has sought to cushion the blow of the banking crisis with a lending program known as the Bank Term Funding Program, or BTFP, which aims to help banks meet their obligations to depositors.\n\nProponents of bitcoin say it can serve as a store of value in times of economic distress and a form of money people can access without the need for a bank account.\n\nHowever, it is incredibly volatile and has been known to swing up or down 10% in a matter of hours.\n\n\"The market seems to be placing greater importance on macroeconomic factors and that the Fed has already begun a form of QE, now known as BTFP, but also that the interest rate pivot might happen sooner than later,\" Ayyar told CNBC.\n\n\"Against the bank failure backdrop over the past month or so and bitcoin's rise, this provides the perfect context for bitcoin to continue remaining bullish and move higher.\"\n\nWATCH: Crypto enthusiasts want to remake the internet with \u2018Web3.\u2019 Here\u2019s what that means"

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that Bitcoin, Ethereum and most other major cryptocurrencies are trading well below their all-time highs. It\u2019s why the phrase \u201ccrypto winter\u201d has become a top discussion among investors.\n\nWhile a bear market has scared away many individual investors and financial institutions, others are now laying the groundwork for the next bull run.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: This Startup Built the World's First AI Marketing Platform That Can Understand Emotion and Some of the Biggest Companies on the Planet Are Already Using It\n\nTwo of the world\u2019s largest and most respected financial institutions \u2014 BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments \u2014 recently dove headfirst into the cryptocurrency world. And with a combined $14 trillion in assets under management, it\u2019s something to pay close attention to.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink Excited About The Future\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his excitement about the future of cryptocurrency and digital assets as a whole.\n\n\u201cAt BlackRock we continue to explore the digital assets ecosystem, especially areas most relevant to our clients such as permissioned blockchains and tokenization of stocks and bonds,\u201d Fink wrote.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time BlackRock and Fink have made their intention clear about their involvement in the blockchain and emerging technology space. In 2022, BlackRock partnered with Coinbase to provide its institutional clients with access to Bitcoin. That was a bold move for an investment company with the size and reach of BlackRock, but it\u2019s been a welcome addition.\n\nTo stay updated with top startup news & investments, sign up for Benzinga\u2019s Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nFidelity Joining The Crypto Revolution\n\nEarlier this month, Fidelity Crypto made its way to the public, allowing tens of millions of its retail customers to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Adding to the excitement is the fact that all Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions on the app are commission-free.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget this: The investment manager filed three U.S. trademark applications at the end of 2022. The applications made mention of crypto trading, metaverse investment services, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual real estate investing. All of these areas are primed for hypergrowth in 2023 and beyond.\n\nWhen companies like BlackRock and Fidelity take a step into the future \u2014 such as going all-in on cryptocurrency and digital assets \u2014 it\u2019s important to take notice. No one knows when the next crypto bull run will arrive, but when it does it\u2019s safe to say that BlackRock and Fidelity will be in a position to take full advantage.\n\nBanking Collapses as a Catalyst\n\nThe collapse of various regional banks has created a rebound in blockchain-based assets. While they are still off their all-time highs, they are considerably higher than their 2022 lows. The price of Bitcoin has rallied for several weeks now. Gamestop\u2019s NFT marketplace has seen a volume rebound and retail investors have begun increased funding of startups in the space. For example, Gameflip recently crossed $900,000 raised from retail investors in their current equity crowdfunding raise. While institutions previously might have been skeptical of blockchain-based assets, institutional interest might be rebounding following the lack of stability in the banking system, as institutions look for liquid places to store their cash.\n\nSee more on startups investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

        "title": "Stabolut Launches New Bitcoin-backed, Decentralized Stablecoin, USDB - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Introducing a dollar-pegged, Bitcoin backed stablecoin, built without dependencies on banks. Becoming available on a private beta starting today, USDB, a stablecoin that has been built in a revolutionary approach that will reroute the crypto markets unlocking new opportunities for fast and simple trades to power exchanges, financial institutions, businesses, developers, and users.\n\nHONG KONG, March 29, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stabolut, a startup that is building a completely new worldwide payments ecosystem and the issuer of the USDB, today announced that it has just launched a fully decentralized, dollar-pegged stablecoin called USDB. Available as of today, March 29th, 2023, USDB is a stablecoin issued under a groundbreaking model that\u2019s built on decentralized pillars of trustless infrastructure and security that have made Bitcoin the world\u2019s most trusted and reliable cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\nUSDB enters a very hot market, as stablecoins total 140 billion in capitalization, which is currently expected to grow to at least 1 trillion. Simultaneously, opinion leaders in crypto have been asking for a truly decentralized and privacy preserving stablecoin that everyone in the industry can trust, set up with verified and audited assets and invulnerable to shut downs.\n\n\u201cStabolut is setting the new industry leading standards for moving financial value across the internet and crypto markets with USDB,\u201d said Eneko Knorr, co-founder and CEO of Stabolut. \u201cThere\u2019s clear market demand from users for a reliable stablecoin choice, given the collapse of UST -Terra Luna\u2019s stablecoin-, as well as witnessing the recent instability caused by the de-pegging of USDC following the recent bank failures we\u2019ve seen this year. With USDB, Stabolut is helping to unlock a new era of transparent privacy-preserving, fast, inexpensive, secure and interoperable exchange across the globe.\u201d said Julian Beltran, co-founder and CTO of Stabolut.\n\nFor a truly decentralized economy, a decentralized currency is essential. In May 2022, Stabolut embarked on the development of USDB, a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin designed to reflect the value of the US Dollar through an innovative method: shorting Bitcoin via a Bitcoin inverse perpetual swap. Asset-backed USDB eliminates the need for bank accounts, ensuring immunity from crackdowns or frozen funds, and bolstering complete privacy and resilience. Fiat-backed stablecoins face centralization and regulatory hurdles, limiting access and innovation while increasing counterparty risk and reducing user privacy. USDB\u2019s approach aligns with Bitmex co-founder Arthur Hayes' Nakadollar (NUSD) concept.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOur solution addresses the limitations of fiat-backed stablecoins, which suffer from centralization and regulatory challenges. By mitigating counterparty risks and enhancing user privacy, we aim to expand accessibility and foster innovation in the stablecoin market.\u201d said Eneko Knorr.\n\nUSDB will power cross chain transactions and inter-chain exports across all the ecosystems and beyond, providing users and exchanges with a global stablecoin where they can take their power back from the western financial system and interact with their money on their own terms no matter where or who they are. USDB will work broadly with Bitcoin compatible wallets, protocols, and other blockchain services.\n\nTo learn more about the USDB stablecoin, visit the Stabolut website.\n\nAbout Stabolut:\n\nStabolut is a company that is building a complete ecosystem for payments around the globe. Started by serial entrepreneurs with a broad experience in tech and crypto, Stabolut is the issuer of the USDB stablecoin, a digital currency that is poised to solve all the issues and concerns other stablecoins have, with a clear goal to become one of the most widely used stablecoins. Stabolut received funding from the co-founders of Dextools.io, an ecosystem with 30 million monthly visits that allows traders to track information about all the decentralized markets.

        "content": "Will Bitcoin keep minting more millionaires or is this just a 'dead cat bounce'? Here's why Warren Buffett believes crypto 'will come to a very bad ending'\n\nAre you a fan of roller coaster rides? Have we got the investment for you: Bitcoin.\n\nDon\u2019t miss\n\nThrill-seekers and earnest crypto fans have spent the last few years watching the alternative investment rise and fall \u2014 sometimes with exhilaration and sometimes with that sinking stomach feeling.\n\nAfter hitting an all-time peak of around $69,000 per unit on November 10, 2021, the world's leading digital currency has since erased roughly 60% of its value, sitting at about $26,800 right now.\n\nTo be sure, bitcoin has rallied once again over the last several weeks, up nearly 62% so far in 2023.\n\nBut what would the world's most famous investor say to those who might be thinking of buying Bitcoin right now?\n\n\u201cIf you ... owned all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it,\u201d Warren Buffett told CNBC earlier this year.\n\nOther than Bitcoin's disappointing track record, here are three more reasons Buffett won\u2019t go near it.\n\n1. It has \u2018no unique value at all\u2019\n\nThe billionaire investor doesn\u2019t like Bitcoin because he considers it an unproductive asset.\n\nBuffett has a well-known preference for stocks of corporations whose value \u2014 and cash flow \u2014 come from producing things. But cryptocurrencies don\u2019t have real value, Buffett said in a CNBC interview in 2020.\n\n\u201cThey don't reproduce, they can't mail you a check, they can't do anything, and what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for them later on, but then that person's got the problem.\u201d\n\nThough Bitcoin is intended to provide real value as a payment system, that use is still pretty limited. As Buffett sees it, Bitcoin\u2019s value comes from the optimism that someone else will be willing to pay more for it in the future than you\u2019re paying today.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. He doesn\u2019t think crypto counts as money\n\nBuffett has made his share of extremely cutting remarks about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency over the years: \u201cI don't have any Bitcoin. I don't own any cryptocurrency, I never will,\u201d he told CNBC back in 2020.\n\nAs a tradeable asset, Bitcoin boomed. But does it meet the three criteria of money? According to the most common definition, money is supposed to be a means of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account.\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nBut Buffett calls it a \u201cmirage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not meet the test of a currency,\u201d the billionaire said on CNBC in 2014. \u201cIt is not a durable means of exchange, it's not a store of value.\u201d\n\nHe adds that it\u2019s a very effective way of anonymously transmitting money. But: \u201ca check is a way of transmitting money too,\u201d he said. \u201cAre checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money?\u201d\n\n3. He doesn\u2019t understand it\n\nBuffett became one of the most successful investors in history by sticking with stocks he understands.\n\n\"I get in enough trouble with things I think I know something about. Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don't know anything about?\u201d\n\nBut people like to gamble, he told CNBC after a 2018 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, which is another problem with nonproductive assets.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand it, you get much more excited than if you understand it. You can have anything you want to imagine if you just look at something and say, \u2018that\u2019s magic.\u2019\u201d\n\nHow does Buffett pick winning stocks?\n\nThe billionaire investor follows the value investing strategy \u2014 which focuses on buying undervalued stocks of strong companies and holding them for a long time.\n\nSimple, right?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway looks for companies with a good profit margin and those that produce unique products that can\u2019t easily be substituted. As Warren Buffett once said in a letter to his shareholders, \u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u201d\n\nBut Buffett\u2019s distaste for crypto stocks doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you shouldn\u2019t buy Bitcoin. Even the billionaire has come around on sectors he previously spoke out against.\n\nHe notoriously avoided tech stocks, even at the height of the dot-com bubble, and now his company\u2019s largest holding is Apple.\n\nAlternative alternative investments\n\nWith inflation still sitting at a steep 6.4%, many investors these days are aiming to fight inflation outside of the volatile stock market.\n\nBut if Buffett's wariness has put you off crypto, yet you\u2019re still keen to dip into investments outside of traditional stocks, you have options.\n\nHistorically, alternative investments have been the purview of institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. But new platforms are demystifying niche markets and making it easier and cheaper to buy in, especially for non-accredited investors.\n\nThese platforms give retail investors access to a range of private market investments that typically have a low correlation to the stock market, with some requiring a minimum investment of just $500.\n\nThese include luxury vehicle finance, commercial real estate, fine art and even legal finance.\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
