The affected platforms are the HTX digital currency exchange, which used to be known as Huobi, and the blockchain bridge Heco Chain. Both are linked to entrepreneur Justin Sun.\n\nHTX and Heco Cross-Chain Bridge Undergo Hacker Attack. HTX Will Fully Compensate for HTX's hot wallet Losses. Deposits and Withdrawals Temporarily Suspended. All Funds in HTX Are Secure, and the Community Can Rest Assured. We are investigating the specific reasons for the hacker\u2026November 22, 2023 See more\n\nHTX said it would \"fully compensate for any losses incurred due to the hot wallet attack,\" according to CNBC, and is working on finding the source of the hack.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), pleaded guilty to federal charges related to money laundering, the Department of Justice announced Tuesday. The plea came with an agreement to pay more than $4 billion.\n\n\"Binance became the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed \u2013 now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.\n\nThe DOJ's statement also included apparent warnings to other crypto platforms, highlighting the work the department has done to crack down on the industry.\n\n\"The message here should be clear: using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor, it makes you a criminal,\" Garland continued.\n\n\"Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime or face the consequences,\" Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said in the same announcement.\n\nBinance users pulled over $1 billion off the exchange since the news came out, CNBC reported.\n\nOf course, this all comes in the wake of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried being found guilty of fraud earlier this month, making it a largely chaotic month for the crypto world."
