        "content": "Crypto fell with stocks Wednesday as investors worried about the debt ceiling and the Federal Reserve's next move.\n\nBitcoin fell more than 3% to $26,207.42, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost about the same amount and was trading at $1,787.17.\n\nThe move coincided with a drop in U.S. equities. The Dow was down nearly 300 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell about 1% each.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said debt ceiling talks are still hung up on spending levels \u2014 with eight days to go until the U.S. is at risk of a default. He also said he believes the negotiating teams could make progress Wednesday.\n\n\"Markets opened quite down after being down significantly yesterday, so this could be a reaction to that,\" said David Wells, CEO at Enclave Markets. \"Even though crypto is a global market, volumes pick up quite a bit during U.S. trading hours, so sometimes big crypto moves are following big equities moves that are macro driven.\"\n\nAs investors monitor the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations in Washington and Fed officials divided on where to go with interest rate hikes, bitcoin has started behaving like a risk asset again, just as it was starting to trade more in tandem with gold earlier this year.\n\nBitcoin and ether are on pace for their worst month of 2023, down 10% and almost 6%, respectively. Bitcoin is down more than 7% for the quarter, after finishing the first quarter up 71%. Ether is down 1.8%, after it posted a 52% gain in Q1."

        "title": "Don't treat crypto like gambling \u2014 even if it is largely pointless - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nEven the heat of Miami can\u2019t warm a crypto winter.\n\nThe faithful descended on Florida last weekend for the world\u2019s \u201cbiggest bitcoin event\u201d. Only half as many made the journey as in 2022. Some of the buzz and meme coins were gone. So was the sense of indestructibility, after a year in which some of the crypto world\u2019s biggest names cratered and US agencies launched a slew of enforcement actions in the sector.\n\nThere was a cold blast from Westminster last week too, where an influential parliamentary committee suggested that crypto was, not disruptive or renegade, but worse: borderline irrelevant. Unbacked cryptoassets, said the Treasury select committee, had \u201cno intrinsic value\u201d and served \u201cno useful social purpose\u201d. The right thing to do to protect consumers, it suggested, was to regulate this activity as gambling.\n\nThis was dismissive, appealing and, I think, wrong. The committee has a point about utility. You can be open-minded about the potential for distributed ledger technology, or even stablecoins and central bank digital currency, and still think cryptocurrencies have totally failed to demonstrate their usefulness, either as a store of value, medium of exchange or tool for financial inclusion. \u201cThe industry still does a very bad job of explaining things,\u201d says Oliver Linch, chief executive of Bittrex Global. \u201cIt\u2019s been wink wink . . . if you know, you know, to the moon nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s concern was that financial regulation would mean a \u201chalo effect\u201d for that kind of guff, giving a false sense of safety \u2014 a legitimate concern. But \u201cto say it\u2019s gambling makes no sense legally\u201d, says Marc Jones, partner at Stewarts Law firm, noting the ownership aspect to cryptoassets. Nor would it be likely to result in effective regulation.\n\nThe dividing line between financial regulation and gambling is already murky. Spread betting and other types of leveraged trading are taxed as gambling but regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Adverts for betting platforms prominently display that 80 per cent of retail accounts lose money, an at-source version of the FCA\u2019s warnings in the absence of more powers.\n\nMeanwhile, UK gambling regulation is still trying to catch up with the invention of the smartphone. It is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, says Matt Zarb-Cousin, who campaigns to clean up gambling. This year\u2019s gambling reform proposals belatedly pledge controls on free bets and other inducements. The FCA sent shares in spread-betters tumbling in 2016 with leverage limits and bans on account bonuses and promotions. Crypto (and spread betting) can cause gambling-like harm, says Zarb-Cousin. But better to incorporate protections such as self-exclusion tools into the tougher financial framework.\n\nDividing responsibility between regulators would be a mistake. The crypto universe doesn\u2019t neatly split into conceivably useful and definitely pointless. A split is an invitation for regulatory arbitrage. And the intersection of crypto with mainstream finance should be of as much interest to regulators as the tokens themselves.\n\nThe committee\u2019s report seems unlikely to prompt a change of direction from the government, which in February followed Europe and other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong in proposing to regulate crypto under the UK\u2019s existing financial services framework.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make it insignificant. After much excitable talk about the UK as a \u201cglobal crypto hub\u201d, the mood has shifted \u2014 a shift that, oddly, this latest broadside could reinforce. Crypto will increasingly be asked to play by the rules of mainstream finance. The committee is unlikely to be pushing for a lighter touch in the name of innovation.\n\nThis is also true internationally. The US crackdown rests on protecting investors using the same securities laws and standards as for the rest of finance: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to treat the crypto market differently just because different technology is used,\u201d said SEC chair Gary Gensler last year. Iosco, the co-ordinating body for global securities regulators, this week called for watchdogs to move faster in establishing a \u201clevel playing field between cryptoassets and traditional financial markets\u201d, including breaking up crypto firms where services including broking, trading and custody are combined in a way that would be unacceptable elsewhere.\n\nAll signs to date \u2014 from Binance\u2019s troubles in securing licences, to the low success rate for UK anti-money laundering registration \u2014 suggest that large parts of the crypto world, even those eager for the warm glow of accreditation, will struggle to clear basic hurdles, let alone a like-for-like standard. As the crypto winter lifts, it won\u2019t just be conference audiences that have shrunk.\n\nhelen.thomas@ft.com"

        "content": "Bitcoin fell below US$27,000, recording the second biggest loss among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies on Wednesday afternoon in Asia. Dogecoin topped the day\u2019s decline, leading the downward trend as all the coins in the top 10 list recorded losses. Asian equities fell as U.S.-China tensions escalated after China banned U.S. memory chip maker Micron Technology\u2019s products. The world\u2019s second biggest economy faces a new Covid-19 wave. U.S. stock futures fell as negotiations on raising the U.S. debt ceiling failed to make progress.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong to open crypto to retail traders, plans guardrails\n\nDogecoin leads the losers pack\n\nBitcoin lost 2.33% to US$26,671 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency lost 0.68% over the last seven days.\n\nEther dropped 2.15% to US$1,813, but gained 0.30% on the week.\n\nDogecoin was the day\u2019s biggest loser, dropping 2.83% to US$0.07119, bringing its weekly losses to 2.02%.\n\nBNB, the native token of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, lost 1.81% in 24 hours to US$307. On Tuesday, a Reuters report alleged that Binance had mixed client funds with its own corporate revenue, which violates U.S. regulations.\n\nThe total crypto market trading volume fell 6.35% to US$28.72 billion, while the global crypto market capitalization lost 1.78% to US$1.12 trillion.\n\nAmong corporate developments in Asia, StraitsX, a Singapore-based digital asset payment firm, announced its StraitsX Singapore Dollar (XSGD) stablecoin will be available on the Hedera, a distributed ledger-based network, in a statement on Wednesday. The partnership allows users to send and receive XSGD on Hedera.\n\nSince its launch in October 2020, XSGD has surpassed over 7 billion XSGD in on-chain transactions, making it one of the largest non-USD stablecoin by market capitalization, StraitsX said.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales surge\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index inched down 0.46% to 3,376.48 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong while declining 0.30% during the week.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecondary non-fungible tokens sales on Bitcoin rose for the first time this week, increasing 65.92% to US$4.8 million in the past 24 hours, boosted by a 3.45% sales increase in Bitamigos, that generated over US$1.9 million for the world\u2019s first blockchain, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales picked up for the first time this week, rising 4.35% to US$14.6 million, along with the Forkast ETH NFT Composite, which rose 0.11% to 1,129.28 points. The largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 5.47% to US$530,769 and Milady Maker sales increased by 3.52% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 million.\n\nAmong other developments, Singapore-based NFT company Bored Island Group opened a physical profile picture NFT gallery, BIGHAUS, on May 20, according to a statement.\n\n\n\nThe gallery was developed in collaboration with a range of NFT clubs, namely, the 250-member Bored Ape Singapore Club, as well as CryptoPunks Club SG, Goblin Town, Doodles, and others. The current collection is valued at 33.7 million Singapore dollars (US$25 million).\n\nAmong acquisitions in the sector, Vertex Labs, the metaverse, Web3, and AI infrastructure provider, has acquired London-based digital art studio Digimental Studio, developer of 3D NFT fashion brand HAPE, for US$12 million, the company said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.\n\nThrough its acquisition of Digimental, Vertexlabs.uk will introduce a staking programme for its HAPE community members, the statement said. HAPE currently has a trading volume of US$200 million, the company said.\n\n\u201cBuilders and brands are pushing Web3 forward with innovative products and solutions, but it\u2019s the collectors and communities that are showing the real strength of NFTs in the bear market,\u201d according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nU.S. futures down amid Sino-U.S. pressures and debt concerns\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equities fell on Wednesday as investors traded cautiously after Sino-U.S. tensions rose following China\u2019s ban on products made by U.S. memory chip maker Micron Technology citing security concerns. Traders are also concerned as raising the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations has not progressed.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite dropped 1.28% and the Shenzhen Component Index lost 0.84%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index fell 1.62% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.89%.\n\nThe world\u2019s second biggest economy, struggling to recover from three years of pandemic-led disruptions, reportedly faces a new Covid-19 wave that may see as many as 65 million cases per week by the end of June.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures dropped as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.17%, the S&P 500 futures index fell 0.19% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.20%.\n\nThe stagnating debt ceiling negotiations have also weighed down investor sentiment, as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday that the two sides had yet to reach a deal, to avert the government\u2019s default by June 1. Negotiations are set to resume this week, for raising the US$31.4 trillion debt ceiling.\n\nInvestors now look forward to the May policy meeting minutes of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee, scheduled for release on Wednesday, along with corporate earnings from tech companies like Nvidia, Snowflake and Splunk.\n\nEuropean bourses also fell on Wednesday, weighed down by the uncertainty on the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations. The benchmark STOXX 600 fell 1.36%, on track for its biggest daily drop since March 24, while Germany\u2019s DAX 40 fell 1.24%.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, annual consumer price inflation for April decreased to 8.7% from 10.1% in the previous month, but food prices continued to rise at the fastest pace in 45 years, soaring 19% in the 12 months to April. Following the release on Wednesday, London\u2019s benchmark FTSE 100 fell 1.43% to 7,651.63 points, its lowest level since early April.\n\nSee related article: Governments could access Ledger wallet private keys, says CEO"

        "content": "Bitcoin 2023 Miami: Ordinals and Politicians Bring The Heat to Marquee Bitcoin Conference\n\nIt's May in balmy Miami, and that means Bitcoin 2023 is in town (well and those NBA playoffs as well!). The world's largest Bitcoin conference hosted its 2023 edition at the Miami Beach Convention Center for a final time last week. After 3 years in Florida, it\u2019s moving to Nashville in 2024. The conference welcomed the Bitcoin faithful from May 18 to 20, in the latest bid to dispel the Bitcoin winter gloom for good.\n\nThe next presidential hopeful, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., , was among the notable speakers at the event this year. Best-selling author Michael Lewis of The Big Short, Moneyball and The Blind Side was also present. U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry and presidential candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Tulsi Gabbard also attended the event.\n\nBitcoin heavyweights in attendance included Michael Saylor, Adam Back, Samson Mow, Jack Mallers, Caitlin Long, Robert Breedlove, Dan Held, and recent convert David Marcus, who graced the Nakamoto and mining stages to dissect Bitcoin\u2019s biggest pain points and rally the masses.\n\nIndustry Day\n\nThursday's Industry Day was a rather muted affair this year. There was a noticeable decrease in turnout compared to 2022, not only in attendance but also in (mainstream) star power, when the likes of Serena Williams and Jordan Peterson shared their 2 satoshis worth at the Bitcoin event last year.\n\nIt served as an overdue autopsy, with various panelists dissecting last year's FTX meltdown, intense regulatory scrutiny in the US, as well as a renewed emphasis on the importance of self-custodying your Bitcoin holdings.\n\nSeveral engaging talks on the main Nakamoto stage covered all corners of crypto. From why we need Bitcoin in the face of CBDCs and AI, to regulators, Bitcoin NFTs, TradFi, greener mining and so on.\n\nOne notable session, \"Boom to Bust: Wall Street & FTX,\" featured Jan van Eck and Eric Donovan. They explored the relationship between the financial industry and the now-defunct exchange, and the lessons it holds for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe panel \"Fed vs Financial System '' brought together Caitlin Long, Miles Paschine, Ram Ahluwalia, and Mark Connors. They analyzed the complex dynamics between the Federal Reserve and the financial system.\n\nOther discussions centered around eco-friendly advances in Bitcoin mining, the renewed interest in self-custody, and combating anti-crypto sentiment. Frank Holmes and Andy Long shared insights on mining during the \"Mining Stage\" panel. Matt Odell provided a comprehensive Bitcoin 101 session, emphasizing the importance of self-custody. Additionally, experts like David Zell, Perianne Boring and Mina Khattak discussed strategies for combating regulatory obstacles in the \"Fighting the Anti-Crypto Army\" panel.\n\nGeneral Attendance Day 1\n\nAfter a slow Industry Day on Thursday, Friday saw a sizable uptick in attendance. A solid turnout of visitors came to listen to and interact with hundreds of speakers, Bitcoin proponents, and projects during General Attendance Day 1.\n\nHighlights included pro-Bitcoin regulation talks by Democratic Party hopefuls, Arthur Hayes\u2019 interview with \u201cThe Big Short\u201d author Michael Lewis, the big Ordinals debate, Jack Mallers\u2019 Strike unveiling and more.\n\nSaylor On Ordinals\n\nBitcoin\u2019s biggest evangelist, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, continues to accumulate Bitcoin over the long term with little regard for short-term fluctuations. He put in a long day in the service of the world's leading cryptocurrency.\n\nThe tech billionaire spent several exhausting hours in the media room at the tail end of the day, where he conducted many in-depth interviews and waxed lyrical about the role of Bitcoin in the face of inflation, authoritarian regimes, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Oh, and network congestion caused by BRC20 and Ordinals transactions.\n\nOn the latter, Saylor remained neutral, stating that he neither endorsed the likes of Ordinals nor wanted it censored.\n\nHe believes that the entire discussion of ordinal inscriptions is important to Bitcoin for two reasons.\n\n1) For Bitcoin to achieve long-term success, the Bitcoin miners must be successful.\n\n2) For companies, governments and individuals to adopt Bitcoin, it is necessary to develop applications on layer two and layer three.\n\nIf one were to discourage application developments, it would make it more difficult to scale and would also harm the Bitcoin mining network, where transaction revenue has to grow faster than the hash rate for the network to grow .\n\nElection 2024 Candidates Champion Bitcoin\u2019s Cause\n\nIn their talks, Kennedy and Gabbard highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s values and importance as a tool against governmental overreach. They explained that it will help to combat enhanced surveillance and financial control, facilitated by CBDCs and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThey criticized US regulators' hostile climate for crypto companies and investors, such as the 30% Bitcoin mining tax. Kennedy in particular laid out a strong manifesto in which he pledged to ensure Bitcoin stays the global hub of crypto. He aims to do this by defending the right to self-custody and run home nodes of Bitcoin, ensuring the neutrality of industry energy regulations, and even reviewing whether the likes of Ross Ulbricht should be pardoned if they\u2019re victims of an anti-crypto crackdown.\n\n\u201cWe broke Bitcoin\u201d: Bitcoin Ordinals Debate Takes Center Stage\n\nThe Big Bitcoin Ordinals Debate brought together experts to discuss the future of Bitcoin. It delved into the implications of ordinals, which have split the Bitcoin community into smaller factions. Those that embrace BRC20 see ordinals\u2019 extended use cases for BTC. But, others see them as an attack on the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency due to the network congestion and fee spikes they bring with them.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Magazine Youtube\n\nBitcoin purists and the new Ordinals and BRC20 rebel alliance clashed on the Nakamoto stage Friday afternoon.\n\nUdi Wertheimer and Eric Walls of Taproot Wizards, sporting cheap wizard outfits and beards, shared the stage with Spiral\u2019s Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core contributor, and masked independent writer Shinobi Monkey. Things got off to a predictable start with Shinobi getting called a \u201cBlockchain Karen\u201d by Wertheimer after saying ordinals were an attack on Bitcoin that originated out of the Bitcoin SV camp.\n\nDuring the often lighthearted and technical discussion, the expert panelists explored whether ordinals pose a threat to Bitcoin, and the need to distinguish between user behavior and the underlying protocol. The debate also touched upon different approaches to tokenization, such as counterparty tokens, and covered the efficiency of protocols and trade-offs involved, especially with BRC20.\n\nArthur Hayes Interviews Michael Lewis\n\nDuring a fireside chat, Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, interviewed Michael Lewis, the bestselling author known for books like \"Moneyball\" and \"The Big Short.\"\n\nLewis drew attention in the crypto community after spending time with Sam Bankman-Fried for research on his next book on the FTX collapse.\n\nLewis expressed he\u2019s intrigued by the crypto space and referred to it as \"Financial Kanye.\" He criticized the persistence of financial intermediaries in the banking system, noting that they have found ways to rig the system and take unnecessary rents. Lewis expressed hope for a financial revolution through DeFi. He also speculated on US regulators' slow response to bail out banks connected to crypto during the recent liquidity crisis.\n\nMallers\u2019 Strike Expands to 65 countries and Adds Lightning Features\n\nJack Mallers, CEO of Strike, announced that his Bitcoin payments company Strike has expanded to 65 countries. It would also be moving its global headquarters to El Salvador, as US crypto firms are getting out to friendlier regulatory pastures.\n\nThe expansion allows users to send and receive money instantly using the Lightning Network, catering to the requests of users. The update also introduces the ability to receive funds in U.S. dollar equivalents, including USDT, and a revamp of the app's user interface and logo.\n\nDuring his speech at Bitcoin 2023, Mallers emphasized the company's wider vision, aiming to provide a reliable service for Bitcoin adoption and a unique brand identity. Mallers highlighted the company's responsiveness to user feedback and expressed their commitment to being an exceptional global money app.\n\nSaturday: Day 2 General Attendance\n\nThe final day of Bitcoin Miami 2023 delivered several strong talks revolving around Bitcoin\u2019s current and future use cases. It also covered challenges in an ever-evolving broader technological, investing and regulatory landscape.\n\nNotable talks include The Art of Bitcoin Banking panel with Caitlin Long, Obi Nwosi (Fedi) and Casa\u2019s Jameson Loop, while Adamant Research\u2019s Tuur Demeester pondered if \u201cAI Dream of Electric Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWertheimer was on again in the Transaction Censorship panel with Nick Hansen (Luxor) and Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s Craig Deutsch. The discussion then shifted to global with Zoltan Pozcar (Credit Suisse)\u2019s talk on Geo Politics and Bitcoin. Following that, El Salvador government member Max Keiser explained the plot behind Super-HyperBitcoinization to Stacy Herbert of the Bitcoin Office.\n\nAfter lunch, Lyn Alden and Dylan LeClair spoke on Lightning for Businesses and Steady Lads.\n\nThe 2023 edition finally concluded with a short but good one: The Biggest Bulls. The old and new guard of Bitcoin, Adam Back of Blockstream and Strike\u2019s Jack Mallers espoused on the value of Bitcoin, with the organizer\u2019s Matt Odell moderating.\n\nAsked at what price he would sell his BTC, Mallers made it clear that only health-related expenses would separate him from his satoshis.\n\n\u201c... the only thing that I mentally compartmentalize to reference how to price this thing is how much I value my life.\"\n\nExhibition Hall Highlights\n\nOf course, Bitcoin Miami wouldn\u2019t be the same without some extravagance.\n\nBitcoin Bazaar\n\nThe Bitcoin Bazaar market provided plenty of Bitcoin in-jokes, cool stuff and not-so-subtle digs at the wider crypto space, with everything from Bitcoin panties, shitcoin toilet to Bitcoin children\u2019s books.\n\nAttendees could also ride a mechanical bull to win 1 BTC, play a cornhole competition or kick a soccer ball, or simply gawk at a Bitcoin DeLorean car straight out of Back to the Future.\n\nOrdinals Alley\n\nThe Ordinals Alley by Gamma provided strong visual energy to the event, with dozens of eye-catching art pieces adorning temporary walls and many sold for auction.\n\nThis scene seems likely to continue to explode in the coming year, and with the independent event Ordinals2023 running simultaneously in Miami this year.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBitcoin Week wrapped up in Miami on Bitcoin Pizza Day. It is the industry\u2019s Thanksgiving, with a couple of small events to celebrate Laszlo Hanyecz\u2019s 10,000 BTC sacrifice.\n\nLast year saw a staggering 35,000 visitors flock to the event on the back of the 2021 bull run. The conference, organized by BTC Inc. and Bitcoin Magazine's owners BTC Media, LLC, only drew an estimated 15,000 visitors this year. Factors such as the ongoing crypto winter, Bitcoin market doldrums, and steep ticket prices all drove down attendance.\n\nThe 3-day event remains a necessary staple on the crypto calendar. It serves as a platform for passionate discussions about the impact of Bitcoin. This includes its role in the battle for society in a technological and authoritarian landscape.\n\nOverall, the conference can be a bit heavy handed on the Bitcoin rhetoric if you\u2019re a bit more chain-agnostic. But, it still provides a feast of worthwhile ideas, innovation and discussions for everyone.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Miami 2023 may not herald Crypto Spring yet, it is setting itself up as a springboard to what is to be a much sunnier 2024. With the next Bitcoin halving locked in for late April next year, and the Ordinals and BRC20 movement growing, expect things to be very different this time around next year in Nashville."
