        "content": "Bitcoin crushed by US dollar urfinguss\n\nMore investors backed bitcoin than the dollar as the preferred investment during a default, a Bloomberg survey found.\n\nBut gold was the top choice, due to its history as a safe haven asset and recent price gains.\n\nTreasurys were the second choice, as most expect the US would still meet its debt obligations eventually.\n\nIn the case of a US default, retail investors favor bitcoin over the dollar, underlining the token's appeal as a safe haven asset.\n\nThat's according to Bloomberg's most recent Markets Live Pulse survey, which asked investors what they would buy if the US hit its debt ceiling.\n\nTo be sure, gold led the list of responses, with 51.7% of professional investors and 45.7% of retail investors preferring bullion.\n\nIn second place came Treasurys, drawing 14% of professionals and 15.1% of retail investors. Bitcoin followed with 7.8% and 11.3%, respectively \u2014 versus the dollar's 7.8% and 10.2%.\n\nA default could arrive as soon as June 1, if lawmakers fail to lift the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling before the government runs out of money.\n\nBloomberg's MLIV survey also found that 41% expect greenback would weaken in a default, which could also accelerate de-dollarization trends.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin rallied in an earlier period of stress this year, namely the banking crisis sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nPreviously, Standard Chartered told Insider that this is largely due to bitcoin's decentralized mechanism, and estimated that a default could push the cryptocurrency up by about $20,000.\n\nOther analysts told Insider that they expect gold would likely climb in a default as well. A weakening dollar could further propel the metal. Continued purchases of gold by central banks and a loosening of global monetary policy could also help support it.\n\nAs for Treasurys, UBS has previously predicted bonds would rally if the debt ceiling doesn't get resolved, as this would most likely lead to economic contraction and investors would still see US debt as a relatively safe haven.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "The heavily shorted U.S. dollar surged against the basket of fiat currencies last week, putting pressure on risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC). The leading cryptocurrency, however, held on to key support in a positive sign for the market.\n\nThe dollar index, which gauges the greenback's performance against fiat currencies, rose by over 1.3%, registering the biggest single-week percentage gain since February, data from charting platform TradingView show.\n\nBitcoin fell by 5.8%, living up to its reputation of being negatively correlated to the greenback. However, sellers failed to establish a foothold under the 200-week simple moving average, a widely-tracked technical line that capped the upside in February.\n\n\"By defending this key average, the bulls have convinced the market of the sustainability of the long-term bullish trend,\" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at the FX Pro, said in an email.\n\nPer Kuptsikevich, the cryptocurrency must top $28,500 to bring in cautious buyers waiting on the sidelines for stronger evidence of an end of the price pullback. At press time, bitcoin changed hands near $27,400, up 1.4% on the day, having hit a high above $31,000 last month.\n\nSome observers expect the dollar to continue moving higher, keeping gains in cryptocurrencies under check.\n\n\" I think the dollar is due for a bounce as markets take back some FED easing implied in the futures curve. My fundamental FX framework: currencies are driven by real growth differentials and political considerations over longer cycles, but in the short term, it\u2019s all about playing relative central bank policy (changes in nominal rates). Depending on how violent the dollar upswing gets, it could cause some short-term damage to assets like commodities and crypto,\" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets, derivatives engine at Marex, said in an email.\n\nAnalysts at Swissblock Insights voiced a similar opinion in a note to subscribers on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The DXY could hit anywhere from 104 to 107 considering it crossed over the 102 level since mid-March,\" analysts said, adding that renewed dollar strength could continue to pressure BTC as its ties to TradFi are strengthening.\n\nSwissblock Insights expects dollar index to resume downtrend after a brief bounce.\n\nPer Swissblock Technologies, the impending dollar bounce will likely pave the way for a deeper decline that would bode well for cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"This month-long structure will eventually break, and both assets will experience price discovery \u2013 bitcoin to the upside, and DXY to the downside,\" Swissblock Insights said.\n\nSolot expects a pullback in bitcoin to be short-lived, offering a \"a great entry point to position\" for investors.\n\nWallets known to hold coins for at least six months have accumulated coins during the recent bout of weakness, hinting at confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects."

For example, the decentralized nature of blockchains means there\u2019s no one to turn to if things go wrong. In addition, transactions can be much more expensive on a blockchain than through a bank or debit or credit card.\n\nIf you decide that investing in a blockchain is the way to go, it makes sense to consider the top two.

If you\u2019re looking for a cryptocurrency alternative to fiat currency, bitcoin seems to be a good choice, as long as you\u2019re prepared to weather the volatility.\n\nTechnically speaking, Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency.
