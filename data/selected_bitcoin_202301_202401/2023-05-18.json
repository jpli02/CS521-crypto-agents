CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images\n\nThe US dollar has been the world's reserve currency since the second world war, playing a crucial role in the world's trade.\n\nBut countries globally are now lining up backup currencies for trade, as sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have led to some prominent world leaders and business figures sounding a warning over the power Washington \u2014 and the US dollar \u2014 wields.\n\nSanctioned countries like Russia and emerging nations like Argentina have recently started using the Chinese yuan for trade, primarily with China.\n\nEven so, there's no indication the dollar's dominance could fade in the foreseeable future, simply because the currency is such an integral part of the world economy, Insider's Jennifer Sor reported on May 6.\n\nThe dollar is by far the world's most dominant reserve currency \u2014 meaning a large quantity of a foreign currency held by central banks and major financial institutes for their use from investments to payments.\n\nIn 1999, over 70% of the world's foreign exchange reserves were held in the US dollar.\n\nBut that percentage has been dropping \u2014 the dollar's share in global foreign exchange reserves fell to under 60% in the fourth quarter of 2021, the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, said in a June 2022 blog post.\n\nAnd despite accounting for the lion's share, or 54%, of global foreign exchange reserves in the fourth quarter of 2022, there has been a decline in the dollar's share of the total foreign reserve pie, per IMF data.\n\nBut this doesn't mean America's strategic competitors \u2014 like China \u2014 wouldn't stop challenging American hegemony. Even alternative currencies like the Swedish krona, the South Korean won, and the Australian and Canadian dollars have been chipping away at the greenback's share.\n\nRead further for five assets that are trying to topple the dollar's dominance."

        "title": "MicroStrategy Looking at Bitcoin Ordinals for App Development, Says Michael Saylor - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said the company isn\u2019t just aware of Ordinals, it\u2019s interested in how the protocol that\u2019s set Bitcoin\u2019s community abuzz could lead to software innovation.\n\nIn an interview at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami, Saylor exclusively told Decrypt that the software firm is looking at Ordinals and assessing its potential in terms of application development.\n\nOften used to create NFT-like assets on top of Bitcoin, Ordinals launched in January, and the protocol\u2014while not embraced entirely by the Bitcoin community\u2014has created a new wave of experimentation with crypto\u2019s oldest coin.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Fees Soar to Two-Year Highs, El Salvador Pays the Price\n\nOne recent innovation in the space leveraging Ordinals is an experimental framework for building tokens on top of Bitcoin. It was pioneered by the pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo in early March. And since then, thousands of other so-called BRC-20 tokens have been created.\n\nAll those transactions have been partly\u2014or entirely, depending on who you ask\u2014responsible for elevated transaction fees on Bitcoin. That\u2019s been a boon for Bitcoin miners, who collect transaction fees for their role in securing the network. But lots of members of the community have complained that high fees make it harder for regular people to use BTC as the peer-to-peer electronic cash system that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, intended it to be.\n\nThe discussion surrounding Ordinals is important, Saylor said, because \u201cBitcoin miners have to be successful over the long term.\u201d He added that the development of applications building on Bitcoin\u2019s functionality could also bolster the coin\u2019s overall adoption, among individuals, firms, and governments.\n\nSaylor didn\u2019t specifically say what use cases MicroStrategy could be looking into that tap Ordinals, but he noted the ability to commit data to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that isn\u2019t solely related to transactions has many potential applications.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of burning a piece of data on the blockchain opens the door to the possibility that I might burn a digital signature, or I might burn a registration, or I might burn a hash of a document,\u201d Saylor said.\n\nMichael Saylor: Bitcoin Ordinals Are a \u2018Catalyst\u2019 for Adoption\n\nTouching on corporate security, Saylor mentioned DocuSign, which lets businesses and individuals send and sign agreements securely using the firm\u2019s electronic signature product. But that makes mega corporations reliant on a proprietary database, Saylor noted.\n\n\u201cRight now, enterprises have weak security compared to Bitcoin,\u201d Saylor said, adding that innovations using the world's largest cryptocurrency could possibly \u201cintroduce a new level of security\u201d available to firms \u201cthat doesn't exist right now.\u201d\n\nSaylor\u2019s comments come just a week after he described Ordinals as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for Bitcoin adoption on the PBD Podcast. Still, he acknowledges that Ordinals have been used for plenty of silly reasons.\n\n\"The general consensus is criticize stuff that we think is silly, but don't censor it,\" he said on Thursday in Miami.\n\nSaylor didn't want to predict \"which protocol will win,\u201d but he said altering Bitcoin so that it censors certain uses would be wrong. It was a nod to the effort by a group of core Bitcoin developers, including Luke Dashjr, to treat Ordinals as \"spam\" and filter them out of transactions.\n\n\u201cIf somebody wants to change the protocol, in order to censor someone else from using Bitcoin, I don't think that's consistent with the values of the community,\u201d Saylor said. \u201cI do believe in rules without rulers.\u201d"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nGrayscale, manager of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fund, has long been stymied by regulators in its bid to convert its flagship vehicle into an exchange traded fund.\n\nHowever, it may have found a ruse to partially circumvent the restrictions imposed by the US Securities and Exchange commission.\n\nGrayscale has filed to launch a US-listed ETF that would partly invest in so-called \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin exchange traded products already up and running in other countries.\n\nThese ETPs invest directly in \u201cphysical\u201d bitcoin, or track the cryptocurrency\u2019s price synthetically \u2014 structures the SEC has so far not permitted.\n\nInstead, the SEC has only allowed bitcoin ETFs that trade in futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is a regulated venue.\n\nThis stance has prompted Grayscale to sue the SEC for its refusal to allow the $16.9bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a private spot bitcoin trust, to convert to an ETF. A ruling is due by the end of the third quarter.\n\nIn the interim, though, Grayscale has filed to launch a Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, which would invest 40 per cent of its assets in spot bitcoin ETPs listed on \u201cmajor non-US exchanges\u201d, such as in Canada or Europe.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that the application will be approved, analysts believe it has a chance given that the overseas ETPs Grayscale is proposing to invest in are regulated securities \u2014 precisely the type of asset that the SEC has insisted crypto ETFs hold.\n\n\u201cGrayscale\u2019s filing seems intended to push the envelope with the SEC by using the SEC\u2019s own words against it to launch crypto ETFs,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America at Morningstar.\n\n\u201cThis seems like Grayscale is directly challenging the SEC\u2019s past decision to allow bitcoin futures ETFs on one hand and on the other hand reject spot bitcoin ETFs,\u201d he added.\n\nTodd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy, described the filing \u201cas a creative way of Grayscale trying to offer US-listed product with some spot bitcoin exposure\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think there is greater likelihood of Grayscale getting approval for this ETF than it getting the SEC to voluntarily approve a US-listed spot bitcoin only ETF, which is what Grayscale wants,\u201d he added.\n\nRosenbluth believed the filing was an \u201cacceptance of the reality that the SEC is not going to give [Grayscale] the green light\u201d, to convert GBTC.\n\nOne point in Grayscale\u2019s favour in its latest filing is that vast numbers of US-listed ETFs already hold regulated, non-US securities, mostly in the form of equities and bonds.\n\nIndeed, at least one US ETF already holds foreign-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, appearing to set something of a precedent for the structure.\n\nThe $447mn Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) has positions in four Toronto-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, although they currently account for just 4.3 per cent of its portfolio, with the balance in stocks of companies involved in blockchain technology.\n\nGrayscale is proposing that its 40 per cent exposure to spot bitcoin ETFs would be weighted equally between five underlying funds.\n\nRosenbluth also noted the \u201cadded irony\u201d of Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) having a 6.8 per cent exposure to Grayscale\u2019s GBTC trust, even though the SEC deems GBTC\u2019s structure to be unsuitable for an ETF. The SEC declined to comment.\n\nEven if Grayscale was to get approval for the Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, it is far from certain there would be a huge appetite for the fund, however.\n\nIt is proposing that the remaining 60 per cent of the portfolio would be invested in the equity of bitcoin mining companies. Armour was unconvinced there was much demand for such a structure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think investors benefit from access to a 60/40 portfolio of bitcoin miners and a global spot bitcoin fund of funds sleeve,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe portfolio is confusing and will do a worse job tracking the spot bitcoin price than a bitcoin futures ETF, so I\u2019m not sure this type of product adds any value aside from parsing out the SEC\u2019s strategy for approving bitcoin-related ETFs.\u201d\n\nRosenbluth agreed demand might be lacking, saying \u201ccombining bitcoin with other investments is not novel but has had limited interest\u201d.\n\nAs evidence he cited the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which invests in the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) and bitcoin futures, but which holds just $11mn.\n\nRosenbluth noted that despite a strong bounce for bitcoin and crypto-related companies after last year\u2019s sharp losses, with the currency itself up 61 per cent so far this year, \u201cdemand for ETFs exposed to bitcoin has been limited\u201d.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\n\u201cInvestors seem sceptical the rally can persist and remember the challenges of 2022,\u201d he added.\n\nFor instance, although the $1bn ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the largest bitcoin futures ETF, was up 57 per cent year to date as of May 12, it had only seen net inflows of $95mn, according to VettaFI\u2019s data. This was not far ahead of the $75mn attracted by the $120mn ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF Strategy (BITI), which takes the opposite bet and is down 44 per cent year to date.\n\nBKCH has returned 69 per cent so far this year but has seen net outflows of $2mn. Likewise the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) is up 68 per cent \u201cand has seen no investor interest either\u201d, Rosenbluth added.\n\nMichael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale, was more bullish, however, arguing that \u201cthere is no question, coming out of the crypto winter, that investors\u2019 appetite for crypto remains healthy. It has certainly not gone unnoticed by the crypto community that crypto has achieved some of the highest returns in 2023 to date.\u201d"
