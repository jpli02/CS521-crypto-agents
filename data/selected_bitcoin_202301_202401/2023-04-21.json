But looking at the data more closely paints a different picture.\n\nWhen looking at overall trends, Bitcoin trade volumes seem to have spiked, with two trading pairs standing out during that stretch \u2014 Bitcoin-Tether and Bitcoin-BUSD, a relatively little-known stablecoin trading on the Binance platform that has since halted issuance, according to crypto market data provider Kaiko. Those two were the top-traded duos on that exchange in the first three months of the year."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nThe increase in bitcoin's (BTC) dominance rate, or the largest cryptocurrency's share of the overall crypto market, has halted, hinting at the potential outperformance of alternative tokens known as altcoins ahead.\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency other than bitcoin.\n\nData from TradingView show bitcoin's dominance rate rose to 48% from 42% during the first quarter and has struggled to surpass that level so far this month.\n\nThe metric has oscillated between 38% and 48% for almost two years, with declines from 46% to 48% coinciding with outsized gains in altcoins.\n\n\"Bitcoin\u2019s dominance could peak out, this would signal that altcoins would outperform,\" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin's dominance rate's previous declines from 48% coincided with the altcoin market boom. (CoinDesk/TradingView)\n\nThe chart shows that the total market cap of altcoins (white line, blue arrows) rose more than 60% to $1.39 trillion in the two months after the BTC dominance rate turned lower from 48% in July 2021. Similar bearish turnarounds in the dominance rate in mid-October 2021 and June 2022 also pushed altcoin valuations higher.\n\nHistory could repeat itself, according to Thielen.\n\n\"Bitcoin\u2019s dominance appears to be peaking out at similar levels as in 2022 \u2013 accounting for 45/46% of the total crypto market capitalization,\" Thielen said. \"For bitcoin to continue outperforming the rest of the ecosystem would imply that only bitcoin matters, which appears to be unlikely considering the intellectual and financial firepower that is being deployed on other chains.\n\n\"Bitcoin benefited from U.S. liquidity, but going forward, this could change,\" he said."
