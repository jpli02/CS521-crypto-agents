        "content": "Chalk it up to the heat, to late-summer doldrums, or to the phases of the moon, but the usually volatile Bitcoin hasn\u2019t been acting in its typical sporadic ways of late.\n\nThe largest digital currency has gone eight trading sessions without a 1% move, the longest such stretch since the start of January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Before that, one has to go back to October 2018 to find such a streak."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA married couple from New York dubbed \"Bitcoin Bonnie and Crypto Clyde\" pleaded guilty on Thursday to laundering billions of dollars in stolen bitcoin, prosecutors announced. Ilya Lichtenstein , 35, and Heather Morgan, 33, were arrested in February last year after the US government seized 95,000 bitcoin then valued at $3.6 billion.Prosecutors said the pair stole the bitcoin in 2016 using \"advanced hacking tools.\" Authorities recovered the funds from wallets controlled by the duo.Since their arrests, the government has seized another approximately $475 million tied to the hack, the Southern District of New York said in a statement.In total, the couple admitted to laundering conspiracies arising from the theft of approximately 120,000 bitcoin from Bitfinex , a global cryptocurrency exchange.The charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.Prosecutors said that Lichtenstein, at times with Morgan's help, \"employed numerous sophisticated laundering techniques.\"That included using fictitious identities to set up online accounts and utilizing computer programs to automate transactions.They deposited the stolen funds into accounts in a variety of darknet markets and cryptocurrency exchanges and then withdrew the money, which confuses the transaction history.They couple also converted bitcoin to other forms of cryptocurrency and even exchanged a portion of the stolen funds into gold coins, which Morgan then concealed by burying them.One of Morgan's aliases was \"Razzlekhan\" while Lichtenstein was known as \"Dutch.\"The couple were dubbed \"Bitcoin Bonnie and Crypto Clyde\" by financial newsletter Morning Brew"

        "content": "The Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference is thrilled to welcome renowned whistleblower and cybersecurity expert, Edward Snowden, to its landmark event, where he will share his insights on the intersection of digital currency, privacy, and the future of financial freedom during a 45 minute long online talk with a Q&A session.\n\nThe event will take place in Westergas, Amsterdam on October 12-13, 2023 and will bring together industry leaders, enthusiasts, and experts to discuss the future of bitcoin, decentralization and freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2013, Ed Snowden alerted the American people to the fact that the US Government was knowingly conducting warrantless surveillance of its own citizens; a violation of basic rights. It was a watershed moment both for government overreach, as well as for the ability of individual freedom fighters and cypherpunks to push back. As Snowden announced to the world at Bitcoin 2019, Bitcoin was a key tool in his efforts to expose the ongoing surveillance,\u201d said Brandon Green, Head of Events for BTC Inc. \u201c10 years after his initial action, Snowden will talk to our community at Bitcoin Amsterdam about the ongoing fight to protect privacy for individuals, not just in the US, but around the world, and especially right here in Europe. And he will discuss the importance of Bitcoin in that fight,\u201d continued Green.\n\nAs a prominent advocate for cybersecurity and freedom, Edward Snowden has long expressed his support for Bitcoin, stating \"Bitcoin is free money... When I think about liberty, that\u2019s what this is all about. It\u2019s freedom from permission.\"\n\nHe views it as an essential tool for preserving financial privacy and protecting individuals from surveillance and censorship. Snowden's endorsement of Bitcoin aligns with its core principles of decentralization, transparency, and financial sovereignty, making his appearance at the Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference highly anticipated.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Bitcoin, BNB , Tron, and Shiba Inu were trading with gains, while XRP Litecoin , Cardano and Polkadot were trading with cuts.\"The crypto market has experienced slight selling pressure in the last 24 hours. The crypto greed and fear index is up by 2 points and is currently in the neutral zone with a score of 54/100. The overall market, especially BTC, seems to be rather immune to many macro developments in its current state.
