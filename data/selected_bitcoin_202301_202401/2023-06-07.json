        "content": "A bout of Bitcoin turbulence caused by US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuits against key crypto exchanges may be a precursor to short-term gains in the token, if history is any guide.\n\nThe largest digital asset sank more than 5% on Monday, before recovering over 5% on Tuesday, as investors digested the agency\u2019s actions first against Binance Holdings Ltd. and then Coinbase Global Inc."

        "content": "The wave of government enforcement against cryptocurrency companies is beginning to remake the industry.\n\nCoinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, has opened a business in Bermuda. Gemini, a rival firm based in New York, is seeking a license in the United Arab Emirates. And Bittrex, an exchange in Seattle, has shut down its U.S. operations.\n\nAfter years of trying to shape federal regulation in the United States, a growing number of American crypto companies \u2014 particularly the exchanges where customers buy and sell digital tokens \u2014 are exploring plans to build their businesses abroad. They are expanding into new markets and weighing the possibility of leaving the country entirely.\n\nThe moves are a response to a growing law enforcement crackdown that has made the United States one of the strictest regulators of crypto in the world. On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a long-anticipated lawsuit against Coinbase, arguing that the exchange was marketing securities without the proper registration. A day earlier, the S.E.C. sued the international crypto exchange Binance, seeking to bar its founder from the U.S. securities market."

        "title": "Crypto ownership doubles in UK before new rules kick in - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nCrypto ownership more than doubled in the UK last year, the Financial Conduct Authority said on Wednesday, as it announced an October start date for its clampdown on mis-selling in a sector often dubbed finance\u2019s \u201cWild West\u201d.\n\nAlmost one in 10 people surveyed by the UK\u2019s top financial regulator owned cryptocurrencies in 2022, more than twice the number a year earlier, despite regulators warning that crypto investors should be prepared to lose their entire outlay.\n\n\u201cIt is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto . . . Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice,\u201d said Sheldon Mills, the FCA\u2019s head of consumers and competition. He added that its crackdown on crypto group advertising would begin on October 8.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s update comes in a bruising week for the crypto industry after two of its largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, were sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over alleged securities law violations.\n\nIn recent months, the UK has proposed a sweeping new regulatory regime for crypto where rules governing the industry will be brought more closely into line with those for traditional financial services. A cross-party group of MPs recently criticised the policy, suggesting instead that crypto be overseen as a form of gambling.\n\nSome 36 per cent of 2,000 adults polled by the FCA said they had seen or heard crypto adverts, while 25 per cent of those who had not previously been involved in crypto became \u201ccurious\u201d as a result of being exposed to advertising campaigns.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s crypto marketing regime will require companies to use risk warnings and offer a \u201c24-hour cooling-off period\u201d for customers. Incentives for customers to \u201crefer a friend\u201d will also be banned.\n\nThe regime will apply to all crypto asset businesses marketing to UK customers, regardless of whether they are based in the UK or overseas. \u201cThe crypto industry needs to prepare now for this significant change,\u201d Mills said.\n\nHarry Eddis, a lawyer at Linklaters, said the rules would have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the UK market by making it harder for people to buy crypto currency.\n\nThe FCA currently regulates crypto firms for money-laundering compliance only. Its research found that 28 per of those who do not use crypto would be \u201cmore likely\u201d to buy it if the market and activity were regulated to a similar standard as traditional financial services.\n\nThe increase in ownership of crypto assets has come despite a tumultuous period for the market, which suffered a crisis of confidence last year that resulted in the collapse of former industry bellwether FTX.\n\nThe research also showed almost four-fifths of those buying crypto used disposable income to fund the purchases, 6 per cent borrowed money, and the rest used savings or gains from crypto sales.\n\nThe mean value of their investments was put at just under \u00a31,600, with 40 per cent holding less than \u00a3100. The most common reason given for buying crypto, as stated by 40 per cent of respondents, was \u201cas a gamble\u201d.\n\nThe price of the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which peaked at more than $64,000 in November 2022, on Wednesday fell nearly 3 per cent to $26,484.\n\nA renewed crackdown on crypto marketing follows a blitz of American enforcement cases this week.\n\nThe SEC on Monday filed a lawsuit against Binance, alleging the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange mixed billions of dollars of customer cash with a separate trading firm owned by its chief executive Changpeng Zhao.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SEC sued Nasdaq-listed rival exchange Coinbase, alleging it violated US securities law by failing to register as a broker, national securities exchange or clearing agency."
