        "content": "Late one night in early December, Aiden Pleterski, a self-proclaimed \u201cCrypto King,\u201d was kidnapped, then beaten and tortured over three days, according to court records.\n\nEventually, his kidnappers \u2014 including one of his investors \u2014 let him go, but they left him with a threat: Pay up fast and don\u2019t go to the police, court records said.\n\nThis week, Akil Heywood, 39, who had invested with Mr. Pleterski, 24, was charged with kidnapping him. The Toronto Police Service said in a statement on Monday that it had arrested and charged four men on counts of kidnapping for ransom and other charges: Mr. Heywood, Tyler Fast, 37, and Deren Akyeam-Pong, 24, all of Toronto, as well as Rakeem Henry, 24, of London.\n\nMr. Heywood was among dozens who invested with Mr. Pleterski, who was supposed to invest their money in cryptocurrency and foreign exchange positions, according to court documents. But after spending money feeding a lavish lifestyle, buying three Lamborghinis and three McLarens, Mr. Pleterski filed for bankruptcy in August, leaving investors wondering what had happened to their money."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nSure, OK, why not:\n\nWorthing, 20th July 2023 \u2013 Flooring Hut, a forward-thinking online carpet and flooring retailer, announces its decision to include Bitcoin holdings on its balance sheet, embracing the integration of digital assets into its financial reporting. With this strategic move, Flooring Hut demonstrates its commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements and adapting to the evolving financial landscape.\n\nFormed in 2015, Flooring Hut stocks a wide range of carpet, laminate and vinyl flooring solutions, and is obviously engineering the kind of publicity stunt that\u2019s catnip for snarky blogs such as ours.\n\nBy diversifying its asset holdings to include Bitcoin, Flooring Hut embraces innovation and positions itself at the forefront of the digital economy.\n\nAccording to Companies House filings, the privately-owned company has four shareholders and two employees.\n\nFlooring Hut recognises the growing interest and demand from stakeholders, including investors, partners, and customers, who value transparency and progressive approaches to financial reporting. Including Bitcoin holdings on the balance sheet ensures that the company remains responsive to the expectations of its diverse stakeholders.\n\nIts 2023 accounts showed a loss of \u00a3173,423 and cash reserves of \u00a375,105, which at spot pricing is enough to buy 3.2 bitcoins.\n\nDavid Greaves, CFO at Flooring Hut says: \u201cOur decision to include Bitcoin on our balance sheet exemplifies our commitment to embracing digital transformation and being at the forefront of technological innovation. We recognise the potential of cryptocurrencies and their impact on the future of finance. By including Bitcoin holdings, we not only diversify our assets but also demonstrate our dedication to transparency and meeting the evolving expectations of our stakeholders.\u201d\n\nNews of Flooring Hut\u2019s endorsement of bitcoin follows an announcement on Tuesday that it would be \u201chonouring the legacy of Nelson Mandela\u201d through initiatives that combine \u201cthe principles of social responsibility with their expertise in flooring solutions.\u201d On Monday it press-released the donation of a wall clock to K2 Leisure Centre in Crawley, West Sussex. Last week it highlighted the role that innovative flooring solutions play in Bastille Day celebrations. You get the idea.\n\nJournoLink charges companies \u00a380 per press release or a \u00a3119-a-month unlimited subscription to send us this stuff. Flooring Hut has presumably been making the most of the latter option.\n\nBitcoin was up 1.3 per cent to $30,401.81 at press time, probably on unrelated factors.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\u2014 The Pulitzer Prizes in Journalism - how to enter"

        "title": "Bitcoin price falls, heads for weekly loss; Ether flat, Matic leads gainers, Solana the losers - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell on Friday morning in Asia as other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Bitcoin again slipped below support at US$30,000 after a week that saw buyers retreat. Developments in applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to generate fresh investment, though some commentators say the pent up demand is there. Ether traded flat and is also a loser for the week. Matic led the early gainers on Friday, but is also in the red for the week.\n\nBitcoin backs off\n\nBitcoin fell 0.18% to US$29,824.09 as of 6:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has lost 4.53% in the past seven days.\n\nThe drop came amid further developments in Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by U.S. asset managers.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and WisdomTree on July 19 were published in the Federal Register, which means the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now has up to 240 days to accept or request the applications, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBloomberg research analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter that while this sets the clock ticking, the SEC may still reject all the applications.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed its spot Bitcoin ETF application on June 15, sparking a round of buying of cryptocurrencies on expectations more institutional funds will start investing in the asset class.\n\nWhile that enthusiasm has faded, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based brokerage firm FxPro said latent demand for cryptocurrencies remains, although \u201cthe momentum is far from euphoric.\u201d Kuptsikevich added that Bitcoin continued to find support this week on dips below $30,000. \u201cA move to the upper boundary at $31,300 is most likely in this environment,\u201d he said.\n\nAsia Pacific institutional investors \u201cremain constructive across the digital asset complex following last week\u2019s positive news on [ETFs],\u201d said Matt Long, the APAC general manager of California-based international crypto brokerage FalconX. \u201cThey are well positioned for further appreciation in markets,\u201d said Long in an emailed statement to Forkast.\n\nStory continues\n\nU.S.-based digital asset manager Grayscale Investments said in a Friday report that about half of Bitcoin\u2019s 80% increase from December to mid-July relates to macro developments, while the rest is due to Bitcoin-specific positives.\n\n\u201cCrypto no longer behaves as its own ecosystem: Bitcoin and other digital assets are now more correlated with other market indicators,\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cSince January 2023, Bitcoin has appreciated more than can be explained by the rally in tech stocks and fall in the US Dollar. We think this reflects idiosyncratic positives, including optimism about eventual spot Bitcoin ETF approval, as well as Bitcoin\u2019s surge in March following stress in regional banks,\u201d Grayscale said.\n\n\u201cValuations are now more closely tied to broader macro trends, and more Fed tightening could be a headwind for higher risk assets, including both equities and cryptocurrencies,\u201d the report said.\n\nBack in Asia Friday morning trading, Ether edged up 0.31% to US$1,895.14, while falling 4.70% in the last week.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed \u2014 Polygon\u2019s Matic led gainers, rising 3.42% to US$0.7711. However, it posted a weekly loss of 8.46%.\n\nPolygon Labs is currently working on developing Polygon 2.0, a series of updates to the blockchain that the company says aim to make network governance more open and inclusive.\n\nSolana was the biggest loser among the top 10, declining 3.53% to US$25.49, amid a 0.72% weekly loss.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged down 0.15% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 trillion, while trading volume jumped 19.19% to US$37.15 billion.\n\nNFTs fall; OpenSea launches swap feature\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.56% in the past 24 hours to 2,696.41 as of 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index gained a flat 0.01% in the last seven days.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 1.62% to US$18.69 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam. Forkast NFT market indexes measuring performance on the Ethereum, Polygon and Solana blockchains all dropped, while the Cardano index rose.\n\nOn Thursday, NFT marketplace OpenSea announced that it is launching \u201cDeals,\u201d a new peer-to-peer NFT swap function. The company said in a tweet that this will help users avoid falling victim to \u201csketchy DMs & websites\u201d as OpenSea will provide the platform for users to directly engage with each other.\n\nYehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, says this feature is \u201cmore significant than people may realize.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the primary ways people are scammed in the NFT space is through fake trades. Often, legitimate trade sites are spoofed, and then trades offered through there,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cNow collectors will be able to trade using a platform they\u2019re already familiar with and trust, and the best part is there are no fees involved other than gas.\u201d\n\nCurrently, OpenSea allows only ERC-721 NFTs on Ethereum from verified collections to be traded on Deals. To make a \u201cdeal,\u201d a user can offer one or more NFTs in return for another user\u2019s NFTs, where one can also choose to add wrapped Ether (WETF) as part of the offer. The user accepting the deal will have to pay gas fees, according to OpenSea.\n\n\u201cEasy to use, and hopefully will have a major impact on lowering scams. This was long overdue.\u201d Petscher said.\n\nElsewhere, Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club topped CryptoSlam\u2019s NFT collection ranking by trading volume, rising 3.80% in the last day to US$1.4 million.\n\nEthereum was the top performing blockchain network by NFT trade volume, gaining 5.63% to US$13.73 million. Solana placed second, up 4.41% to US$1 million.\n\nU.S. equity futures gain after mixed session\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell | Image: Getty Images\n\nThe three major U.S. stock futures indexes gained as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong on Friday, after equities had a mixed regular trading session on Thursday.\n\nThe Dow Jones gained on top of strong Q2 earnings reports from Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 slipped as Tesla tumbled on weak second-quarter gross margins and Netflix reported less-than-expected revenue.\n\nIn Asia, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index gained, partially recovering from disappointing economic growth data for Q2. Investors are betting on Beijing to step up its economic stimulus measures, according to Trading Economics. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index also rose on China news of authorities possibly easing home buying limits in big cities.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dipped after its inflation rate rose slightly in June. South Korea\u2019s Kospi also slipped.\n\nOn macro events, the next U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting is next week on July 26 when the central bank will make its next move on U.S. interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance that the Fed will announce a further 25 basis points raise that will take rates to the 5.25%-5.50% range, which will be the highest since January 2001.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"
