        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has edged slightly higher ahead of an anticipated 25 basis point rate hike by the Federal Reserve to be announced at 2 pm ET. The cryptocurrency \u2013 which on Monday fell to a one-month low below $29,000 \u2013 is up 0.3% over the last 24 hours to $29,300. Its advance is roughly inline with the broad CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) which is higher by 0.35%.\n\nAlongside that quiet action, a number of altcoins are making sizable moves higher on Wednesday, led by Origin Protocol's OGN token with a 28% advance. Also on the move is Compound's COMP, ahead 16.8%, Convex Finance's CVX, up 9.7% and Solana's SOL with a 6% gain.\n\nAmong those cryptos headed lower is Lido DAO's LDO, off 5%. The worst performer per CoinDesk data is AMP's AMP, lower by 13%.\n\n\"Inflation and rate concerns could be what [has been] keeping crypto prices depressed,\" Noelle Acheson wrote in her \"Crypto is Macro\" newsletter Tuesday. \"These usually recover relatively quickly, but the new lower BTC level seems to be holding, reinforcing the idea that there are just not enough new buyers ready to take positions yet.\"\n\n\"Today's FOMC presser commentary could prove to be a crucial factor, potentially shaking both ETH and BTC out of their current consolidation patterns,\" said Sean Farrell, head of digital asset research and strategy a FundStrat. \"As investors eagerly await the outcome, the question remains whether the market will finally break free from its lackluster state or continue to remain subdued,\" he added.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nMeme crypto Dogecoin (DOGE) is little-changed today following yesterday's 10% advance amidst speculation of its usage in the revamped Twitter platform.\n\nUPDATE (July 26, 08:50 UTC): Updates section on Dogecoin, prices. Adds quote.\n\nUPDATE (July 26, 17:06 UTC): Updates price action."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether edge up after Fed raises interest rates as expected; Solana leads winners - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin gained Thursday morning in Asia, but not enough to break through resistance at US$29,500 after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by the expected quarter point. The bank left the door open for another increase in September. Ether moved higher with most top 10 cryptocurrencies. Solana led the winners as its trading volume more than doubled in the past 24 hours. Dogecoin led the losers as the meme token lost some steam after gaining over 11% for the week. The Forkast 500 NFT index traded flat and U.S. equity futures were mixed, reflecting the same performance on Wall Street on Wednesday.\n\nTop cryptos gain\n\nBitcoin rose 0.90% in the last 24 hours to US$29,459 as of 07:15 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 1.37% for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly breached US$29,600 early Thursday morning.\n\nEther moved up 0.88% to US$1,874, but remained 0.68% lower for the seven-day period.\n\nThe marginal gains followed the Fed\u2019s decision to raise benchmark lending rates in the U.S. to between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest in 22 years, to slow inflation. In a press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said another rate hike in September is possible, but said decisions will be determined by the data at the time.\n\n\u201cAn interesting time for crypto markets although you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell when looking at the price action. With macro markets timidly risk-on, BTC and ETH rose slightly to recoup levels lost earlier this week,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nWith the exception of Dogecoin, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher in the past 24 hours.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL led the winners, jumping 9.51% to US$25.35, but still sitting on a 3.80% loss for the full week. The token\u2019s 24-hour trading volume surged more than 100% to over US$682 million, surpassing that of Ether and indicating investors are betting on a strong rebound.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cSOL\u2019s price increased by about 49% in the past month, primarily driven by the stable development and progress of Solana\u2019s blockchain and ecosystem, with steady growth in user base and restoration of reputation,\u201d said Greta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-based digital asset exchange VDX.\n\nDogecoin lost ground after being the darling of the week as the rebranding of Twitter raised speculation it could be part of a payments system on the social media network. It fell 3.52% to US$0.0784, though is still holding a weekly gain of 11.82%.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 0.85% in the past 24 hours to US$1.19 trillion, while trading volume rose 20.51% to US$30.91 billion.\n\nElsewhere, Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency and digital identity project founded by OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman, issued its controversial WLD token on Monday and prices soared. The token dipped 1.49% to US$2.28 on Thursday, but is up 36.30% since the launch.\n\n\u201cOpenAI co-founder Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin project might just be one of the most ambitious cryptocurrency projects in recent years,\u201d Louis Schoeman, managing director at Dubai-based trading information platform Forex Suggest, said in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cThe project\u2019s core offering, its World ID, requires users to prove via an iris scan that they are human, and not an AI bot. Those who sign up will receive Worldcoin\u2019s cryptocurrency token WLD,\u201d said Schoeman.\n\n\u201cThis sort of digital ID will be necessary in the development of AI, in order to tell the difference between humans and AI bots online. It\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish fiction from reality, which is a particular concern in the financial and democratic systems. Worldcoin wants to defend people from AI misinformation and make it clear who and what to trust online,\u201d added Schoeman.\n\nIn emailed comments on Worldcoin, Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at the U.S.-based crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said: \u201cThe value of a real non-transferable, and cryptographically secure identity is potent as it could reduce digital fraud, help bank the unbanked, and even reduce the number of times I have to convince robots I\u2019m not a robot a day.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, the Worldcoin project signed up more than two million users during beta testing and is now expanding operations to 35 cities across 20 countries, but the US isn\u2019t yet one of them, said Schoeman.\n\n\u201cAltman made it clear the company didn\u2019t feel the US would make or break the project, but with North America said to account for around 18% of the total world crypto value received, breaking into the US market will be a major concern for Worldcoin,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA global digital ID enabling private identity verifications is undeniably revolutionary, however, it\u2019s certain to stir up controversy, with many already calling the exchange of biometric data for crypto tokens an outlandish bribe,\u201d said Schoeman.\n\nForkast 500 flat, Sotheby\u2019s NFT auction sells out\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up a slight 0.57% in the past 24 hours to 2,651.39 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. It\u2019s still down 2.22% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indexes all logged losses.\n\nWhile the overall NFT market remains in the doldrums, auction house Sotheby\u2019s NFT art collections are attracting buyers of so-called generative art, or the process of algorithmically generating art forms.\n\nThemes and Variations, an NFT collection of 500 generative artworks by artist Vera Moln\u00e1r, was sold out within an hour in a Dutch auction on Wednesday for 631 ETH (US$1.2 million). It is the first collection in Sotheby\u2019s Gen Art Program, which aims to spotlight three generative artists each year.\n\nWith secondary markets included, the trading volume of Themes and Variations has totaled over US$2 million, according to data from CryptoSlam, making it the top NFT collection by that measure in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cIn the future we\u2019re going to look back at this time in NFTs as a very special time for generative art,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cArt is still the best use case for NFTs, and it\u2019s exciting to see so many collectors appreciating it even in a market like this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting to see a rather steady stream of higher-end generative art from Sotheby\u2019s, whose new generative art platform is using the Art Blocks Engine to produce these on-chain works,\u201d added Petscher.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 5.16% in the past 24 hours to US$18.41 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Polygon, Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains fell, while Solana, Mythos Chain and Immutable X saw an increase in trading.\n\n\u201cMythos Chain and ImmutableX are also up 47% and 69%, showing yet again that gaming NFTs (from Gods Unchained, CS:GO, TF2, DOTA 2) are another perfect use case for NFTs,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nElsewhere, social media platform Reddit launched the latest series of its NFT collectible avatars on early Thursday.\n\nEntitled \u201cRetro Reimagined\u201d, the collection features designs from both independent artists and NFT developers like Cool Cats. Unlike ordinary NFTs, Reddit\u2019s collectible avatars are purchased with fiat currencies through a Reddit platform at fixed prices, but can be transferred to a third-party crypto wallet as NFTs.\n\nU.S. equity futures rise\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:10 p.m. on Thursday in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular trading the prior day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Wednesday to extend its longest winning streak in six years, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logged losses.\n\nAs analysts expected, the Federal Reserve announced a 25-basis-point rate hike on Wednesday in its more than year-long quest to reduce the inflation rate. The benchmark rate is now in the range of 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest since January 2001.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes rose after the Fed\u2019s rate rise was in line with expectations. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged gains.\n\nIn a press conference following the Fed announcement, the chair Jerome Powell said his agency will keep focused on economic data for future discussions on rate adjustments, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.\n\nThe Fed typically has eight monthly meetings a year to decide on interest rates, with the next two-day gathering scheduled for September 19-20.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks,\u201d said Powell in his statement.\n\nHe said the Fed remains committed to bringing the annual inflation rate to its long-term goal of 2%. The annual inflation rate in June sat at 3.0%.\n\nOn the U.S. economic data front, investors have Thursday\u2019s report on gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter, and Friday\u2019s personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index for additional insights into the state of the economy and inflation.\n\nAmazon, MasterCard and McDonald\u2019s are also set to release their second-quarter earnings on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with comment on Solana in first section.)"
