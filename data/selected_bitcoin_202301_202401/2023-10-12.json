        "title": "Wolfe Research: Bitcoin's resilience above $25000 is 'silver lining' - CNBC",
        "content": "Things seem to have taken a turn lower in the crypto market, but bitcoin offers a glimmer of hope and Wolfe Research is defending its long view of the asset. The crypto market continues to struggle from low volume and liquidity that have dragged on for most of the year. It has traded in a narrow range between $25,000 and $30,000 all year, which many had seen as encouraging, demonstrating that although investors weren't building positions, they weren't exiting either. \"That changed this week with Monday seeing over $105 million in crypto liquidations, and the equal weight crypto index we track breaking down in turn,\" Wolfe Research's Rob Ginsberg said in a note Wednesday. \"We have repeatedly touched on how uninspiring the price action has been outside of bitcoin, and it appears the cracks are finally starting to show.\" \"While the resiliency of Bitcoin continues to be the one silver lining, it's growing increasingly clear just how alone it stands,\" he added. \"[It's] rolling over again in the near term, but our thesis on bitcoin is simple: [as] long as $25,000 support is holding, we'll remain long.\" It takes a patient investor, however. Although bitcoin is up about 61% this year, it's off its all-time high by as much. Not only has it been unable to break out to new highs above $30,000 this year after hitting it for the first time this year as early as April, but it has also underperformed equities for the better part of two years. On top of that, Treasury yields remain high amid stubbornly high inflation and uncertainty around the Israel-Hamas war. \"Higher yields have historically proven to be a headwind to crypto and growth alike,\" Ginsberg said. \"Having failed to take advantage of this pullback thus far, if yields reaccelerate like we think, it should throw some added pressure on BTC.\" Crypto stocks are also trading down, but may be finding support now, according to Wolfe. \"If these bases are for real \u2026 which we believe they are, a next leg higher will have to come soon,\" Ginsberg said. He also highlighted the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF , which is back to its February highs and up about 90% this year. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "title": "Investors sit out ether futures ETFs as spot bitcoin fund hangs in limbo - CNBC",
        "content": "Investor appetite for ether futures exchange-traded funds has remained muted, despite a surge in new listings.\n\nSix new ether futures funds from Bitwise Asset Management, ProShares and VanEck launched on Oct. 2. As of Thursday's close, all six funds have posted losses of 5% or greater since their debuts.\n\nThe broader outlook for crypto is partly to blame, Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Bob Pisani on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" last Monday.\n\n\"When [the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) ] generated a billion dollars on its launch of bitcoin futures, that was because it was brand new,\" said Edelman. \"Frankly, bitcoin was doing fabulous at the time in 2021 and a lot of folks really didn't understand exactly what that fund was, being bitcoin futures. You fast-forward a couple of years, people have learned a lot.\"\n\nThe six ether futures funds that debuted Oct. 2 attracted just $1.92 million collectively on their first day of trading, according to LSEG. When the BITO ETF \u2014 a futures product based on bitcoin \u2014 launched in late 2021, it saw approximately $1 billion of inflows in its first two trading days alone.\n\nCryptocurrencies underlying the futures-based products are still well off their all-time highs reached in November 2021. Bitcoin is hovering near $27,000 \u2014 more than $40,000 below its peak \u2014 while ether is down more than 60% from its high, currently valued near $1,500.\n\nEdelman added that the nature of futures ETFs may be keeping some investors on the sidelines.\n\n\"People are recognizing, 'I don't ordinarily buy futures, so if I'm not buying futures in the stock market, why would I buy futures in the crypto market?'\"\n\nCurrently, regulators are weighing the approval of cryptocurrency spot ETFs that trade based on the current market price of the underlying asset, rather than futures contracts.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has previously blocked spot bitcoin ETFs from coming to market, but a federal appeals court in August overturned a ruling that would prevent Grayscale from converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The SEC has until Friday to appeal the decision.\n\nAccording to Edelman, consumer safety is at stake.\n\n\"The absence of a spot bitcoin ETF isn't stopping people from buying crypto. It's just forcing them to pay for exotic products that cost more and have less liquidity and higher risk,\" he said.\n\nDisclaimer"

Bitcoin, XRP , Solana, Litecoin , and Dogecoin were trading in the red, while Ethereum, Cardano, Tron, Toncoin , and Polygon were trading in the green.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 0.24% to around $1.05 trillion in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin was down 0.8% at $26,897 as of 12:12 p.m., while Ethereum was just above the $1,550 level.\"Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced a consistent four-day decline, indicating a bearish trend in the market. From a technical perspective, it's notable that both crypto's are currently trading below the critical 50 and 200 EMA Daily, with BTC below Rs 23,97,000 ($27,000) and ETH below Rs 1,40,700 ($1,575),\" said CoinDCX Research Team.Meanwhile, ZebPay Trade Desk, said, \"The crypto market is currently facing pressure with Bitcoin and major altcoins experiencing a downturn. This decline is partially attributed to the release of the September Producer Price Index (PPI) report, which revealed a surge in wholesale inflation to 0.5%. This exceeded market expectations, indicating higher inflationary pressures.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $1.88 billion, 7.55% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $23.5 billion, which is 94.41% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, declined to $524 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 49.87%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 7.39% to $12.38 billion.\"Bitcoin is consolidating at $26,800 while altcoins bleed against it. At the same BTC price, Ethereum was trading at $1,800 in July but now it is trading at $1,560. This trend will likely continue through this month. BTC has to reclaim $27,400 in the upcoming days to negate its bearish momentum. Risks of increased oil prices and negative jobs outlook continue to dampen spirits in the crypto ecosystem,\" Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, said.On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin demonstrated its technical position at $26,780, with a critical point set at $27,000. Notable resistance levels include $27,300, $27,745, and up to $28,280. Conversely, immediate support lies at $26,414, with additional levels at $26,186 and $25,989. Investors and traders are closely monitoring Bitcoin's price action, particularly at the pivot point, to assess its future trajectory."

        "content": "The founder of SkyBridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci, is known for many things, including his entrepreneurial endeavors, investment acumen, and a brief stint at the White House.\n\nIn recent years, investors have come to learn that Scaramucci is a big believer in the future of digital assets, specifically Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin: Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin could be a hedge against higher inflation and a national debt that has to be monetized, Scaramucci told Benzinga.\n\n\u201cI think those things will have value over time,\u201d he said of Bitcoin and digital assets during a recent appearance on \u201cThe Raz Report.\u201d\n\nScaramucci said, unlike other assets, you can\u2019t inflate away the value of Bitcoin given its fixed supply. The investor said Bitcoin might be the only asset on the planet with higher demand that can\u2019t have the supply increased.\n\n\u201c [If] you have higher demand for gold, we\u2019ll build more mines. Bitcoin has a finite supply.\u201d\n\nScaramucci told Benzinga that he has a couple of hundred million dollars invested in the cryptocurrency space, including holding Bitcoin on the SkyBridge and his own personal balance sheet.\n\nThe investor also partnered with FirstTrust to launch the FirstTrust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF (NYSE: CRPT) in 2021.\n\nThe ETF \u201chas publicly traded companies that are linked to digital assets,\u201d Scaramucci said.\n\nA look at the top holdings shows the following five companies:\n\nMicroStrategy Inc (NYSE: MSTR): 23.9%\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN): 21.2%\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT): 9.2%\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA): 8.4%\n\nGalaxy Digital Holdings (OTC: BRPHF): 7.4%\n\nRelated Link: Trump's Former Communication Director Casts Doubt On FTX's Revival\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: Like other Bitcoin investors, Scaramucci is optimistic about the cryptocurrency's potential price surge, a sentiment that could be bolstered by future Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nScaramucci said that nobody knows where the price of Bitcoin is heading, but a look at SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) ETF could illustrate what inflows into Bitcoin ETFs could do. Scaramucci highlighted that when investments poured into the gold ETF, gold's price rose. He suggests that as financial institutions venture into Bitcoin through ETFs, a similar trend might occur.\n\nIf Bitcoin ETFs do $100 billion in allocation to Bitcoin, the price of the cryptocurrency could go to $150,000 or $250,000, Scaramucci added.\n\n\u201cI believe it could.\u201d\n\nScaramucci mentioned many stocks that have gone up by 10x or more in the past and added that Bitcoin going to $150,000 to $250,000 is only a five to eight-bagger. \u201cIf I\u2019m right, we could be sitting at $150k, $250k Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCatch the full episode of Anthony Scaramucci on The Raz Report Friday at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nRead Next: Exclusive: Mark Yusko On Bitcoin's Future, 2024 Price Target\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event - Future of Digital Assets.

        "title": "3 Crypto Stocks to Buy as Bitcoin Attempts Another Rebound - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market staged a solid rebound this year after a disappointing 2022 as the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary tightening campaign, which saw aggressive interest rate hikes to combat multi-decade high inflation, weighed on cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB), have been rangebound over the past three months as investors are yet to get a clear picture about the Fed\u2019s future course of action with its interest rate hikes.\n\nBitcoin particularly had been on a rally till July, with its price hitting $31,500. However, the Fed has since hiked interest rates once in July, following which cryptocurrencies took a hit once again. In fact, Bitcoin has been falling since hitting its 52-week high in early July.\n\nHowever, it has also solidified its position over the past few weeks and is now hovering around $26,900 after falling as much as $25,400 in late August and September.\n\nThe rebound has been taking place since the Fed kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged in its September FOMC meeting to its current range of 5.25-5.25%.\n\nA higher market interest rate has a negative impact on high-growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies. The Fed\u2019s aggressive monetary tightening policy has also raised worries that the economy might slip into a recession.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, in his first post-FOMC comment, said that inflation remains elevated, which might require the central bank to hike interest rates by another 25 basis points before it starts cutting interest rates in 2024.\n\nFollowing Powell\u2019s hawkish comments, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note surged to its highest level since 2007. The 10-year Treasury yield holds immense significance as it mirrors market participants' outlook on the nation's economic situation, influencing consumers, businesses and government entities.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, cryptocurrencies are once again trying to rebound from their recent lows as investors\u2019 sentiments have been upbeat following dovish comments from a number of Fed officials. These officials believe that the recent tightening of credit conditions may make the central bank decide not to go for another interest rate hike in its November FOMC meeting.\n\nOur Choices\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023.
