        "title": "US Sells 9800 Bitcoin Seized From Silk Road for $215 Million - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nAfter seizing roughly 50,000 bitcoins from James Zhong in November 2022, the U.S. government has begun selling off these assets, with 9,800 sold most recently.\n\nThis sale, which took place in March 2023, was hardly the first time that the United States government has sold bitcoin seized from what it deems to be criminal operations. In 2014, for example, the federal government sold off roughly 30,000 BTC from the same source as this latest sale: Silk Road, a darknet marketplace that used bitcoin as its medium of exchange and was shut down in 2013. Zhong managed to steal these funds from Silk Road via wire transfer, as detailed in court documents. In light of his age, cooperation with prosecutors and other extenuating circumstances, he was given a relatively light sentence following the confiscation of his bitcoin.\n\nAlthough the government has certainly sold off larger quantities of bitcoin before, the fact that Zhong\u2019s ill-gotten spoils have blossomed from less than $1 million to nearly $1.5 billion in value has complicated matters. The federal government evidently used Coinbase as the platform to conduct these sales, apparently only offloading the first tranche of the hoard and custodying the remainder. The asking price was roughly $2,000 shy per bitcoin of the retail market asking price that day, and the transaction incurred roughly $215,000 in transaction fees. This fact prompted digs from the crypto community, with many noting that far more generous terms could be found on other exchanges. Still, the sale was successful in a sense, and the federal government plans to sell the rest in four batches.\n\nThe origin of these bitcoin is closely related to a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the international crypto community: the plight of Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road\u2019s founder. Silk Road was one of the first major uses of Bitcoin to make international headlines, representing Bitcoin\u2019s humble origins and the libertarian ideologies at the core of the early crypto community. As a darknet market, the Silk Road offered a venue to connect sellers and buyers of various prohibited substances pseudonymously. After the site was shut down, Ulbricht was arrested, and in 2015 given more than a double life sentence without possibility for parole, despite being a first-time, non-violent offender.\n\nUlbricht has reached out to the Bitcoin community from prison, claiming that he\u2019s \u201cspent the last eight years watching Bitcoin grow up from in here.\u201d Citing the community\u2019s courage and potential for innovation, he has stated that, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how things would turn out for Bitcoin back in the beginning, but over the years, I\u2019ve been continually impressed with what you\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, it is incredible how far Bitcoin has come and that comparatively paltry sums while Ulbricht was free have grown to represent billions of dollars in value. However, the extreme harshness of his sentencing is a reminder that institutions of government and finance have been overwhelmingly hostile to Bitcoin in the past, and any acceptance now is itself a massive accomplishment.\n\nIn short, this particular sale, particularly compared to a larger one in 2014, represents the vast growth that Bitcoin has seen since its early days. Despite all of this progress, however, it is important to remember the humble origins of this international community, and all of those who suffered at the cusp of innovation. The events of Silk Road are still relevant to our thriving world of Bitcoin today, and will continue to be for some time to come.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nThe bitcoin halving is an event that happens roughly every four years where rewards to miners are cut in halve, effectively limiting supply of the token. S3studio | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin is nearly a year away from a key technical event \u2014 which might be the catalyst for a prolonged climb in the cryptocurrency's value. In April or May 2024, bitcoin is expected to undergo its next so-called \"halving,\" though the exact date is not yet known. Bitcoin has been rising in the past few weeks in anticipation of the halving, as a potential U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut contends with the prospect of sluggish growth and tightening credit conditions resulting from woes in the banking sector. One bitcoin was worth roughly $30,000 as of Wednesday morning, according to data from CoinGecko. The world's largest cryptocurrency is up by more than 80% since the start of the year. Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, said that the bitcoin jump above $30,000 at a time of bank failures and economic uncertainty suggests the cyclical \"bottom\" for bitcoin is forming.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"This tends to happen a year or so prior to the Bitcoin's halving event, which is slated next for around April 2024,\" Ayyar told CNBC via email.\n\nWhat is the bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin halvings take place roughly every four years, or every time another 210,000 \"blocks\" are added to the blockchain. The event cuts the rewards to bitcoin miners \u2014 volunteers running specialized equipment to validate transactions on the network and mint new tokens \u2014 by 50%. The aim is to reduce the number of new bitcoin unit released into the market. Currently, bitcoin miners receive 6.25 bitcoin for each block they successfully mine. This means their computer had the right amount of computing power needed to solve the cryptographic puzzles that secure the bitcoin network and prevent it from being compromised by malicious actors. Once the next bitcoin halving occurs, this reward will be reduced to 3.125 bitcoin.\n\nwatch now\n\nBackers of the cryptocurrency say this can help push up the price by enhancing bitcoin scarcity. The maximum number of bitcoins that will ever exist in circulation is capped at 21 million. This is ensured by the halving mechanism, whereby rewards for mining bitcoin will eventually be slashed to $0. Before the last halving, which took place on May 11, 2020, the price of bitcoin increased by 19% in the preceding 12 months, from $7,191.36 to $8,568.88, according to figures from CCData. During the halving before that \u2014 which occurred on Jul. 9, 2016 \u2014 bitcoin rallied 142% compared with the 12 months prior, moving from $269.14 to $651.83.\n\nThe first ever halving of Nov. 28, 2012 saw the price of bitcoin balloon by 384% to $12.35 from $2.55, CCData's figures show. \"Analysing historical Bitcoin halving patterns, it appears that investors often accumulate Bitcoin in the run-up to the halving event, although the exact timing and extent of returns post-halving can differ,\" Jamie Sly, analyst at CryptoCompare, told CNBC. \"The accumulation period from the market bottom after the breakout to the halving date has historically spanned at least 500 days.\" Sly added: \"This would mean, if we were to assume that the market bottom for this cycle was in November last year (when Bitcoin hit a yearly low of $15,760), then we are only 142 days into the current cycle. This would correlate with the next expected Bitcoin halving date, which is another 378 days ahead.\"\n\nBitcoin's post-halving gains\n\nThe bitcoin price tends to spike even higher, in the months that follow halving. After the halving of May 11, 2020, the cryptocurrency rallied 688.31% in the following 546 days, reaching a then record high of $67,549.14 on Nov. 8, 2021, according to CCData."

        "content": "Not everyone has suffered from the recent banking crisis. Crypto aficionados have emerged as a fortuitous winner, with Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, soaring nearly 70% year to date.\n\nInstitutional traders believe the brutal year-long crypto winter has finally come to end, with the current macroeconomic backdrop reflecting a trend reversal.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: Taking on the Trillion Dollar IoT Market: One Startup Says AI-Based Data Compaction Can Increase Bandwidth by 300%\n\n2023 Crypto Rally\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,991 in November 2021 before the onset of the brutal crypto winter. But recent market conditions have resulted in investors singing a different tune, touting Bitcoin to be a safe-haven asset and a store of value. While many have heralded Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressively hawkish stance caused decentralized tokens to fall out of favor last year.\n\nIn the wake of the recent banking crisis, analysts predict the Fed will slow its rate hike trajectory. Bitcoin also has long been considered a store of value. Other popular cryptocurrencies including Ethereum (ETH/USD) and meme token Dogecoin (DOGE/USD) have also fared well. Goldman Sachs stated recently that cryptocurrencies hold a 20% market share as a store of value.\n\nOther blockchain-based assets have been performing strong as well. Gameflip is a gaming and NFT marketplace with over $160 million in lifetime volume on their platform. The startup also has a live StartEngine raise, which means anyone can invest for a limited time.

The benefits of decentralized tokens have been highlighted in the wake of the recent bank failures, with many proclaiming Bitcoin to be the new digital gold.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI think the rally is explicable by saying people have got freaked out by the banking system by the collapses,\u201d said Oliver Linch, CEO of Bittrex Global.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, co-founder and CEO of Binance, considers Bitcoin to be better than gold.\n\nAs the crypto rally takes off, analysts and institutional investors are betting on Bitcoin to reach its all-time high again this year.\n\n\u201cI think Bitcoin probably breaks all-time highs this year,\u201d said Marshall Beard, chief strategy officer of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, adding that the cryptocurrency could hit the $100,000 mark.\n\nSee Also: The House-Printing Robot Shaking Up a $7.28 Trillion Industry\n\nVijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, said, \u201cBroadly, we are looking quite bullish here with Bitcoin reclaiming $28K and looking to target $30K next.\u201d\n\nOn March 17, Balaji Srinivasan, former technology chief at crypto exchange Coinbase, bet $2 million that Bitcoin could cross $1 million in just 90 days, as hyperinflation kicks in. Notably, Bitcoin would have to surge by nearly 3,500% within the next three months to reach this mark.\n\nThe blockchain-based gaming market is expected to benefit from the crypto rally to hit a $50 billion valuation by 2025. This marks a 33 times rise from the $1.5 billion market size reported in 2021.\n\nFed Scaling Back And Future Of Crypto\n\nThe Fed\u2019s dovish stance is expected to fuel the bullish case for crypto, as decentralized currencies regain momentum. Typically Bitcoin has outperformed other major asset classes in a bull market.\n\n\"Any time that you've held Bitcoin in a four-year rolling interval, so you pick the day, hold it for four years, you've outperformed every other asset class,\" stated SkyBridge Capital Founder and Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nBut the disappointing jobs report and weak economic data published earlier this week has steered investors to reliable asset classes, including gold.

This, coupled with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s lawsuit against Binance, signals significant regulatory headwinds ahead for the crypto industry. But as the U.S. dollar slides amid Fed\u2019s easing monetary stance and macroeconomic jitters, Bitcoin might hold its position as the best-performing asset in 2023.\n\nSee more on startup investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!
