        "title": "Bitcoin Marketplace OpenBazaar Is Coming Back - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "After a two year break, OpenBazaar, the decentralized marketplace platform, is on its way back to life, according to some vague tweets from its official account.\n\nThe digital marketplace\u2014where users sold goods from homemade candles to medicine\u2014had shuttered in late 2020 due to dried up funding. After initially announcing its closure, the marketplace was temporarily rescued by an anonymous donor\u2014but it ultimately wasn't enough to keep OpenBazaar open for business.\n\nOpenBazaar CEO Brian Hoffman confirmed in a message to Decrypt that he is rebuilding the marketplace, though he declined to add any further detail. The OpenBazaar website has been updated to say \"openbazaar 3.0 - coming soon.\"\n\nopenbazaar was built by the community from nothing.\n\nfor a long time it has slept, but it is now time to grow again from the ashes. \u2014 OpenBazaar (@openbazaar) March 28, 2023\n\nOpenBazaar is like the digital marketplace to Bitcoin\u2019s currency. It was known for its unique approach to online shopping, providing a decentralized marketplace where users could buy and sell goods without the need for a central authority, like, say, Amazon or Etsy. The idea was to give users more freedom over the goods they sold.\n\nThe plan worked for a while before OpenBazaar's funding issues. Merchants set up hundreds of shops, accepting cryptocurrencies for their goods.\n\nAccording to Hoffman's GitHub account (a site where developers post their code publicly for others to use), he has been working on a new implementation of OpenBazaar in the programming language Rust, which is all the rage in Bitcoin lately.\n\nBitcoin Privacy Tool Aims to 'Confuse' Surveillance Companies\n\nOn Twitter, some users are already excited about OpenBazaar\u2019s return.\n\nIn an interview with CoinDesk in 2018, OpenBazaar co-founder Washington Sanchez described OpenBazaar's purpose as such: \"OpenBazaar is supposed to be a free and open protocol for trade using cryptocurrency, a way for currencies and tokens to gain meaningful economic utility to acquire goods and service, and an entry point for people to earn and onboard.\"\n\nFollowing the OpenBazaar's shutdown in 2020, its founders hinted that structural changes would be needed to further place control of the marketplace in the hands of its community and away from the company that initially created it."

Obviously, a lot of excitement surrounding this.\n\nSCOTT MELKER: Yeah, there was a bit of a nonsensical narrative that everybody who had staked their Ethereum for the past few years was going to try to withdraw all at once, which you couldn't do anyways, and sell all their Ethereum. But you have to remember that anyone who staked their 30 to Ethereum, which by the way, for most people, was over $60,000.

So now that they're getting the opportunity to withdraw, they're going to continue staking. I think there were more people.

So we're actually seeing net inflows over the past 24 hours. It's going back and forth. But there has not been a huge demand for people to withdraw. And there are just as many people putting their money into the contract. I think that this is a huge development for Ethereum. Yet another major step in the right direction for the protocol.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And do you think perhaps investors are more bullish on Ethereum given the use cases versus Bitcoin?\n\nSCOTT MELKER: I view them as completely separate assets. I think that the flipping narrative is completely irrelevant. I view Bitcoin as a digital gold, store of value, flight to safety. And we've obviously seen that, especially, with the banking collapses a few months ago, and Bitcoin rise a few weeks ago. With Bitcoin rising from roughly 19,000 to over $30,000, Ethereum is more of a technological investment. It's a internet of value. And I think that we're starting to see that separation in people's minds. So I think you can love one, love both, and it's totally fine. You don't have to really choose. I think that they're separate asset classes and should be viewed as such."

        "title": "NFL's Aaron Rodgers' Hail Mary For 2024 Presidential Election: Fellow Anti-Vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr. - Benzinga",
        "content": "A leading National Football League player has shown early support for a presidential candidate ahead of the 2024 election. Here\u2019s who quarterback Aaron Rodgers is supporting and how one important platform plays into the potential support.\n\nWhat Happened: The 2023 NFL offseason has seen the retirement of Tom Brady for a second time and a looming decision between the Green Bay Packers and star quarterback Aaron Rodgers for the second straight season.\n\nRodgers has expressed his intent to get traded to the New York Jets and leave the Packers. The team has not made a trade official, but many believe it will happen before the start of the 2023 season.\n\nWhile Rodgers has been outspoken about his intent to leave the Packers and play for a new team in 2023, the quarterback could also be sharing his early opinion on the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWith an Instagram stories post, Rodgers shared a promotion of a podcast interview featuring anti-vaxxer Aubrey Marcus and anti-vax presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. In the post, Rodgers showed the hashtag #kennedy2024 and two flexed bicep emojis, alongside two heart emojis. Rodgers has been a guest on Marcus\u2019 podcast several times.\n\nKennedy Jr., the son of former presidential candidate Robert Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, filed to run for president as a Democrat in the 2024 election.\n\nWith his anti-vax platform, Kennedy Jr. has seen his family distance themselves from him, according to the Washington Post. Kennedy Jr. previously compared COVID-19 vaccine mandates to the Holocaust and said that things were worse during COVID-19 with mandates than they were for Anne Frank, a comment he later apologized for.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has not officially declared his intent to run for president in 2024 but an announcement is expected anytime and Biden is the current favorite to get the Democratic nomination.\n\nKennedy Jr. is seen as a longshot to win the Democratic nomination and overall 2024 election. Betting odds from Covers show Kennedy Jr. listed at odds of +10,000, implying a 0.99% chance of becoming the next president.\n\nRelated Link: Aaron Rodgers Says Ayahuasca Helped Him Achieve 'Best Season' Of His NFL Career And Love Himself\n\nAnti-Vax and Anti-Crypto?: Rodgers support for Kennedy Jr. comes as both have been well-known for their stances on vaccinations.\n\nKennedy Jr. has been a major advocate against vaccines, which has led to the presidential candidate being banned from Instagram and having an organization he backs banned from Instagram and Facebook.\n\nRodgers faced backlash after previously saying he was \u201cimmunized\u201d against COVID-19 and misleading the public and potentially the NFL about his vaccine status. Rodgers missed an NFL game in the 2021 season after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe Packers quarterback said he underwent alternative treatment because of being allergic to an ingredient in the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.\n\nWhile it shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise that Rodgers is backing a fellow anti-vax candidate, Kennedy Jr. and the quarterback may differ on opinions on another topic, the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nKennedy Jr. has been vocal as a candidate against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\n\u201cCBDCs grease the slippery slope to financial slavery and political tyranny,\u201d Kennedy Jr. said. \u201cA CBDC tied to digital ID and social credit score will allow the government to freeze your assets or limit your spending to approved vendors if you fail to comply with arbitrary diktats, i.e. vaccine mandates.\u201d\n\nWhile Kennedy Jr. is speaking out against CBDCs, he could show future support for Bitcoin with additional comments.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin give the public an escape route from the splatter zone when this [financial] bubble invariably bursts,\u201d Kennedy Jr said.\n\nRodgers has been a proponent of Bitcoin BTC/USD and cryptocurrency over the years. In 2021, the quarterback announced a partnership with CashApp, a unit of Block Inc SQ.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pumped to share that I\u2019ve recently teamed with CashApp, they\u2019ve enabled me to take part of my salary in Bitcoin for the very first time,\u201d Rodgers said in a video.\n\nRodgers also offered fans the chance to win $1 million in Bitcoin through the partnership.\n\n\u201cI believe in Bitcoin & the future is bright.\u201d\n\nRodgers was also featured at the Bitcoin 2022 Conference where he encouraged college athletes who have NIL and scholarship money to invest a portion into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe Fed keeps printing trillions of dollars, you know, the best defense against inflation, I believe is Bitcoin, and they will keep printing money.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Trump Gains Against DeSantis In New Poll After Indictment, Here's How He Matcches Up Against Biden For 2024 Election\n\nPhotos: Shutterstock"
