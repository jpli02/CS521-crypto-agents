        "content": "Blame it on seasonality, dwindling interest or traders away on holiday, but Bitcoin is ending on a down note for a second consecutive month even with one of the most potentially positive developments for cryptocurrencies in awhile.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest digital asset had been mired in a tight trading range for months until a steep drop in the middle of August dragged the price of Bitcoin below $26,000. Traders chalked it up in part to bond yields climbing to the highest in more than a decade at that time."

While the action potentially paves the way for the firm to attract a fresh wave of investors, there\u2019s just one thing: The product carries a 2% fee in its current form. That compares to an average of 0.54% across US-listed ETFs, and 1.48% for crypto exchange-traded products globally, Bloomberg Intelligence data show."

        "title": "Bitcoin Beneficiaries: Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Propel These Funds - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Big news in the world of cryptocurrencies arrived Tuesday when D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Neomi Rao ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must abandon its rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application to convert the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to the exchange traded fund structure.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not the ruling compels the SEC to finally approve spot bitcoin ETFs \u2013 arguably the most desired product in U.S. ETF industry history \u2013 but experts believe that\u2019s exactly what the ruling implies. After all, Rao wrote her in her opinion that it\u2019s \"arbitrary and capricious\" that the SEC continues stifling GBTC conversion efforts after approving futures-based bitcoin ETFs several years ago.\n\nIndeed, the ruling is \u201ckind of a big deal\u201d and the reasoning behind that statement is easy to understand. Score of ETF issuers have filed applications for spot bitcoin ETFs. Should that structure gain regulatory approval, those funds will create substantial demand for the largest cryptocurrency \u2013 pertinent because bitcoin supply is fixed at 21 million.\n\nTranslation: New demand for bitcoin could lead to more constrained supply, in turn sending prices higher. Should that scenario play out as expected, other established crypto-correlated ETFs stand to benefit. Here are a few to consider.\n\nInvesco Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO)\n\nThe Invesco Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) already proved its leverage to the possibility of a spot bitcoin ETF coming to market, surging nearly 13% on Tuesday following Judge Rao\u2019s ruling. SATO, which follows the Alerian Galaxy Global Cryptocurrency-Focused Blockchain Equity, Trusts and ETPs Index, allocates 15.70% of its weight, making a predictable, potent winner should the index fund convert to ETF status.\n\nAdditionally, the bulk of the rest of the SATO lineup are bitcoin miners equities \u2013 stocks that are intimately correlated to the cryptocurrency\u2019s price action. In other words, there\u2019s a lot to like with SATO should spot bitcoin ETFs be approved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s excellent that the judge in the Greyscale vs SEC case was able to see the obvious correlation between Bitcoin futures and spot price. Products like Grayscale\u2019s holdings have converted to ETFs in other commodity markets, and it makes no sense to treat crypto differently,\u201d said Greg Moritz, Chief Operating Officer at AltTab Capital, in a statement. \u201cRules for financial markets need to be based on data, not arbitrary and capricious sentiment toward a legitimate and growing asset class.\u201d\n\nBitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ)\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) is an index-based ETF that turned two years old in May. Its approach is comparable to that of SATO in that it\u2019s chock full of crypto-correlated stocks, including miners and exchange operators such as Coinbase (COIN).\n\nIndeed, BITQ\u2019s lineup is small with just 27 holdings, but it\u2019s potentially mighty when it comes to leverage to a spot bitcoin ETF coming to fruition \u2013something that could happen.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe the SEC will act as kingmaker and the most likely outcome is a block approval of applications that meet requirements, probably in Q1\u201924,\u201d noted Tim Bevan, CEO at ETC Group. \u201cThe level of pent up institutional and retail demand in the US is significant and we expect this to have a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin as can be seen from today\u2019s price reaction, as well as further accelerate the global trend towards acknowledging crypto as a new asset class.\u201d\n\nGlobal X Blockchain ETF (BKCH)\n\nThe Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) follows the Solactive Blockchain Index and as its name implies, its point of emphasis is blockchain technology. The good news there is blockchain has expansive applications beyond crypto, but BKCH still has credibility as a spot bitcoin ETF beneficiary.\n\nThat much is confirmed by the fact that the Global X ETF is up 7.45% over the past week, indicating it benefit from the appellate court ruling.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark legal win for crypto against the US regulator,\u201d said deVere Group CEO Nigel Green in a new report. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision destroys the SEC\u2019s central argument for rejecting every spot Bitcoin ETF over the last few years. This win paves the way for bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "25 Countries that Mine the Most Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 countries that mine the most Bitcoin. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that mine the most Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, and bitcoin mining in particular, has been one of the most controversial discussions in the past decade, with arguments ranging from it being the savior of private finance to it being considered one of the biggest scams in history. Regardless of what one may think, and despite volatile fluctuations, Bitcoin started to become mainstream in 2017, 8 years after its creation, when the first Bitcoin bubble resulted in explosive popularity, which in turned led to many people losing their life savings after the crash happened. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Bitcoin then reached its best ever run in 2021, with an all-time high of around $68,000 in November 2021, only to crash spectacularly over the next year as well. However, by that point in time, the demand for cryptocurrency, not just limited to Bitcoin, had increased massively, with other cryptocurrencies growing even more and major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) going public in 2021, and is among the best cryptocurrency exchanges and apps in May 2023.\n\n25 countries that mine the most Bitcoin\n\nCompanies driving Bitcoin mining\n\nFor Bitcoin to be created, it has to be mined, a process which has a significant environmental footprint and has been called out for being damaging to the environment. As cryptocurrencies were seeing their values soar, more and more people started to mine Bitcoin due to higher potential margins, especially in the countries that mine the most Bitcoin, and an important component of possessing the firepower needed to be able to mine Bitcoin are graphics cards, which is where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) came in. One of the only companies in the world with a market cap of $1 trillion, it's known more for being a top AI company right now, but is also famous among gamers and cryptocurrency miners for its GPUs. With enthusiasm for cryptocurrency declining as the value of top such currencies fell amid scandals including the collapse of FTX (even though it isn't among the biggest bankruptcies in American history) and the collapse of Celsius, there has been some impact on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, the cryptocurrency, while still far away from all-time highs, has had a new lease on life in 2023, with Bitcoin's value increasing and more people in the countries that mine the most Bitcoin once again increasing their mining operations, and while AI has been the biggest driver of NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than 200% YTD share price gain, cryptocurrency has played a part. At its peak, the use of GPUs were so in demand, even the SEC took notice with the regulator stating the company \u201cfailed to disclose that crypto mining was a significant element of its material revenue growth from the sale of its GPUs designed and marketed for gaming\u201d, and resulted in a $5.5 million fine.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne challenge that companies which produce equipment used in cryptocurrency mining is Ethereum's shift form proof of work to proof of stake will significantly reduce mining requirements and hence, a huge part of demand for cryptocurrency will end as the second largest cryptocurrency will no longer require it.\n\nCryptocurrency industry outlook\n\nWhile the top cryptocurrencies have performed brilliantly in the first half of 2023, it is important to remember that Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest cryptocurrencies in the world, are nowhere near their all-time highs, and so far, have been a bit dismal in the second half of 2023 despite a court ruling against the SEC and in favor of the company which made XRP. Recently, another major cryptocurrency called Worldcoin was launched by the CEO of OpenAI, the company responsible for ChatGPT and the project focuses on identifying whether a person online is real or AI, something which is becoming an increasing concern in today's world.\n\nMeanwhile, though cryptocurrency is currently mainly focused on trading even while providing various applications, it is expected to move more towards nontrading uses as echoed by Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) in its Q2 2023 earnings call \"The first 10 years in crypto were primarily about trading, but we've seen our customer base shift its activity over time where the majority of our active customers now do something with crypto other than trading. My belief is that the next 10 years in crypto will become predominantly about nontrading use cases. So, what could some of those be? Well, payments is a big one. As the scalability of blockchain improves by moving to Layer 2 solutions like Lightning, Optimism, and Base, we'll see payments emerge as a larger use case. Getting more scalable blockchains will be as important as the internet moving from dial-up to broadband. We'll also see the rise of decentralized identity systems with decentralized messaging and social apps that will accompany those connected right into those decentralized identities.\" Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has had an excellent performance in the first two quarters, which has led to its share price increasing by 120% YTD.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the countries that mine the most Bitcoin, we referred a study carried out by Cambridge University which shows the percentage share of each country by month. We have considered statistics for both January 2022 and December 2021, and used the average of these rankings to determine our list.\n\n25. Italy\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.11%\n\nItaly has one of the highest prices for Bitcoin mining, which is why miners are considering other countries, and if this continues, Italy will soon drop off our list.\n\n24. Mexico\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.11%\n\nMexico's importance in cryptocurrency mining can be seen by the fact that the World Digital Mining Summit 2022 was held in Cancun where the focus was on proof-of-work power, not to mention exploring additional industry trends.\n\n23.

Indonesia\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.35%\n\nWhile many countries in our list are clamping down on Bitcoin mining, Indonesia is exploring ways in which Bitcoin adoption will provide benefits to the country, and hence, could likely see Indonesia's rank improve in the coming years.\n\n12. Australia\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.36%\n\nAn Australian company Arkon Energy raised $22 million in November 2022 to further expand Bitcoin mining operations based on renewable energy, as Bitcoin miners try to shed their image of greatly damaging the environment.\n\n11. Norway\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.74%\n\nThere is abundant hydropower in Norway, which has contributed to many cryptocurrency miners forming their base in the Nordic country.\n\n10. Sweden\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.84%\n\nWhile Sweden is among the countries with the highest Bitcoin mining rates, a major tax hike in 2023 is likely to further impact an already declining industry in the country.\n\n9. Thailand\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 0.96%\n\nBitcoin mining has been hampered by actions against miners by authorities across the world and Thailand is no exception, with thousands of cryptocurrency mining rigs seized in late 2022.\n\n8. Ireland\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 1.97%\n\nThe fall in Bitcoin prices has greatly reduced margins for Bitcoin miners especially in Ireland where the cost of mining Bitcoin is especially high. Globally, Bitcoin mining is said to consume more electricity in a year than the entire country of Ireland.\n\n7. Malaysia\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 2.51%\n\nWhile Malaysia is a significant contributor to Bitcoin mining, Malaysian police destroyed over 1,000 Bitcoin mining rigs in 2021 with a steamroller, which happened after the miners stole more than $2 million worth of electricity for their mining operations.\n\n6. Germany\n\nMonthly hashrate share in Jan 22: 3.06%\n\nGermany is considered to be the most crypto-friendly country in Europe and is unsurprisingly among the countries mining the most Bitcoin in the world.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Countries that Mine the Most Bitcoin.
