        "title": "Bitcoin: Assessing whether or not a local bottom has been reached - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "CryptoQuant analyst Wedson has opined that a local top has been reached.\n\nOn-chain metrics, however, paint a different picture.\n\nCryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson has suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] price, which saw a 6% decline in the last week, may have hit a local bottom at the $24,000 price mark.\n\nWedson concluded after assessing the 350-day moving average and the 100-day exponential moving average that makes up BTC\u2019s Taker Buy Sell Ratio indicator.\n\nAccording to Wedson, with the Taker Buy Sell Ratio indicator, analysts have found that the 350-day MA and 100-day EMA can identify BTC\u2019s price trend changes.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nHe noted further that the 100-day EMA crossing a value line of one could also signal local tops and bottoms, presenting buying or selling opportunities.\n\nIn the current BTC cycle, the rally in BTC\u2019s price since the year began pushed the 100-day EMA above one.\n\nThis, according to Wedson, might have ushered in a bear cycle that might result in a downward trend in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nOn-chain price bottom markers say otherwise\n\nIn terms of identifying local price bottoms for cryptocurrency assets, some on-chain metrics have been effective in that regard. One of the most effective indicators is Age Consumed, which monitors the behavior of previously inactive coins on the blockchain.\n\nA surge in Age Consumed indicates a significant number of inactive tokens have been transferred to new addresses, indicating a sudden and pronounced change in the behavior of long-term holders.\n\nSince long-term holders and experienced traders seldom make impulsive decisions, a renewed activity of dormant coins often corresponds with significant changes in market conditions.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nA look at BTC\u2019s age consumed revealed a spike in its Age Consumed metric on 22 February, when the king coin traded at $23,700. BTC\u2019s price spent the next three days rallying to trade at $24,100, at press time.\n\nThe growth in BTC\u2019s price, which followed the surge in Age Consumed, could be taken to mean that the leading coin bottomed at the $23,700 price point, and further rallies should be anticipated.\n\nAnother indicator that might be useful in this regard is BTC\u2019s Network Profit/Loss ratio (NPL). This metric calculates the mean profit or loss of all coins that are transferred to new addresses on a daily basis.\n\nThis approach is used to identify instances of profit-taking or holder capitulation on the blockchain.\n\nDips in the NPL metric frequently indicate brief periods of capitulation by \u201cweak hands\u201d and the return of \u201csmart money\u201d to the market. This is why these dips often occur concurrently with local rebounds and phases of price recovery.\n\nThis has been the case with BTC in the past few days. Data from Santiment revealed a significant dip in the king coin\u2019s NPL on 22 February, which has since been followed by a surge in its price."

        "content": "Since the invention of Bitcoin in 2009 the global cryptocurrency market has grown from nothing to a value of around US$2 trillion. From a price of US$1 in 2011, Bitcoin rose to an all-time high of more than US$63,000 in April 2021, and now hovers around the US$42,000 mark.\n\nLarge fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices are common, which makes them a highly speculative investment. What kind of people are willing to take the risk, and what motivates them?\n\nWe conducted a survey to find out. In particular, we wanted to know about the relationship between the so-called \u201cdark tetrad\u201d personality traits and attitudes towards cryptocurrency.\n\nThe dark tetrad\n\nIn psychology, the \u201cdark tetrad\u201d refers to a group of four personality traits. These are Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy (together known as the \u201cdark triad\u201d), plus sadism.\n\nThey are called \u201cdark\u201d because of their \u201cevil\u201d qualities: extreme selfishness and taking advantage of others without empathy. The dark tetrad are also often related to risk-taking behaviours.\n\nThe appeal of cryptocurrency\n\nWe identified two main areas of appeal. First, the high risks and high potential returns of crypto trading make it attractive to the kind of people who like gambling.\n\nSecond, cryptocurrencies are not issued or backed by governments like traditional or \u201cfiat\u201d currencies. This makes them attractive to people who distrust government.\n\nWhat are the personalities of crypto buyers?\n\nWe asked 566 people to complete online personality surveys as well as answer questions about their attitudes to crypto and whether or not they planned to invest in it. Of our participants, 26% reported they own crypto and 64% showed interest in crypto investing.\n\nWe measured their dark tetrad traits using standard psychological tests. We also measured traits that might connect the dark tetrad to judgements about crypto: fear of missing out(FOMO; the feeling that others are experiencing better things than you are), positivity (the tendency to be positive or optimistic in life), and belief in conspiracy theories.\n\nWhy do people want to buy crypto? It\u2019s not just about making money\n\nA common reason to invest in crypto is the hope of earning high returns. Beyond the desire to build wealth, our research shows dark personality traits also drive crypto buying.\n\nMachiavellianism is named after the Italian political philosophy of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. People who rate highly on this trait are good at deception and interpersonal manipulation.\n\nMachiavellians take a calculated approach to achieving goals, and avoid impulsive decisions. They are less likely to engage in problem gambling.\n\nMachiavellians also tend to believe strongly in government conspiracies. For example, they often believe politicians usually do not reveal their true motives, and that government agencies closely monitor all citizens.\n\nWe found Machiavellians like crypto primarily because they distrust politicians and government agencies. Many crypto supporters believe governments are corrupt, and crypto avoids government corruption.\n\nOverconfidence and positivity\n\nNarcissism is a self-centred personality trait, characterised by feelings of privilege and predominance over others. Narcissists are overconfident and are more willing to do things like make risky investments in the stock market and gamble.\n\nNarcissists tend to focus on the positive side of life. We found narcissists like crypto because of their great faith in the future, and because of their confidence their own lives will improve.\n\nImpulsive psychopaths like crypto\n\nPsychopathy is a callous, impulsive antisocial personality trait. Psychopathic people often find it difficult to perceive, understand, or address emotions due to a lack of emotional intelligence and empathy.\n\nThe reckless nature of psychopaths makes them more resistant to stress and anxiety. As a result, psychopaths like stimulation-seeking and risk-taking. They are prone to gambling and gambling addiction.\n\nWe found that impulsive psychopaths like crypto, because they fear missing out on investing rewards that others are experiencing.\n\nHow is sadism involved?\n\nEveryday sadism relates to a personality enjoying another\u2019s suffering. Sadists often display aggression and cruel behaviours. For example, sadists troll others on the Internet for enjoyment.\n\nSubscribe for counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.\n\nAt first glance, buying crypto is unlikely to harm others. However, we found sadists like crypto because they do not want to miss out on investment rewards either. To them, perhaps both the pleasure from seeing another\u2019s pain and the fear of missing out are related to selfishness.\n\nUnlike narcissists, we found both psychopaths and sadists lack positivity about their prospects, which cancels out their liking of crypto.\n\nDark tetrad personality traits influence positivity, conspiracy beliefs, and fear of missing out, which in turn influence attitudes to cryptocurrency.
