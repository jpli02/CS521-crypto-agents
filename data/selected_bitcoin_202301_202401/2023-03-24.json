        "content": "The exchange giant is joining Fidelity and BNY Mellon in the pursuit of their own cryptocurrency custody platform.\n\nNasdaq, an American stock exchange based in New York City, is reportedly looking at Q2 2023 for the release of its custody services for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Senior Vice President and Head of Nasdaq Digital Assets Ira Auerbach said that Nasdaq \u201cis pushing ahead to get all the necessary technical infrastructure and regulatory approvals in place.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report describes an infrastructure that might look similar to that of Fidelity Digital Assets, which quietly opened its operations to the public last week. The first step to bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading on Nasdaq would be the custody service for the assets.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, \u201cNasdaq has applied to the New York Department of Financial Services for a limited-purpose trust company charter, which would oversee the new business.\u201d\n\n\n\nLaunching just as several major cryptocurrency firms have collapsed, amidst increasing regulatory tension, the goal is seemingly to offer those customers who now have no platform, a regulated, well-trusted American service for bitcoin.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that many of the issues surrounding exchanges come from the third-party risks presented by a custodian holding bitcoin for customers. The most secure way to interact with bitcoin is to self-custody it with your own wallet. Although trading platforms do offer the ease of interaction created by custodianship, with the American financial system seeing precarious headlines as of late, it is important to consider these trade offs compared with traditional bitcoin self-custody.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin Was Built For The Banking Crisis - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nIn the wake of the largest international bank collapses since the 2008 financial crisis, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that Bitcoin\u2019s trustless and decentralized nature was created as an antidote to the increasingly unstable banking system, and that these same principles will prove to be an antidote today.\n\nThe first quarter of 2023 has seen a contagious spread of bank collapses, similar to the cascading failures of crypto businesses after FTX\u2019s failure in 2022. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), an essential component of the burgeoning U.S. tech industry, blossomed to manage billions of dollars as it provided essential liquidity for a variety of tech startups. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the free-flowing investment capital and low interest rates of the 2010s vanished entirely. Anxiety over a downturn in the tech industry mixed with social media panic to create a bank run that brought the place to its knees, and it wasn\u2019t alone. Signature Bank, in New York City, shuttered two days later and days later the Swiss bank Credit Suisse suffered a similar fate.\n\nThese rapid events have been accompanied by a dramatic rise in the valuation of bitcoin, with BTC rising from around $20,000 to $28,000 in a matter of days following the banking crisis. Although Bitcoin has been on a slow and steady recovery since the fallout of the FTX debacle, this represents the strongest jump bitcoin has seen since then. What\u2019s even more impressive is the remarkable way that this boom for bitcoin has come amid a general downturn for the rest of the crypto industry, marked by Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC) losing its peg with the dollar and the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) suggesting many crypto assets could come under more regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThen, the fall of Credit Suisse brought a new dynamic to these bank failures, transforming it into a global concern. The global financial industry spent a decade growing cozy around an infrastructure of easy capital and nonexistent interest rates, and both of those things have now apparently been destroyed. Even if the largest banks have yet to fail, the same economic conditions of failure are everywhere. Many of the most painful lessons of the 2008 collapse have slowly been forgotten, but Bitcoin remembers. As the global economic system moves towards deeper and deeper anxiety, it\u2019s important to remember why so many people bet on bitcoin.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 4.82% in the week from March 17 to March 24 to trade at US$27,926 at 9:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether rose 1.65% in the same period to US$1,772.\n\nv ybYOP1XvhlOvdevPwEHXCsFT7Y1ehXiekUBczy4lVTmqUF0DP5LWQ\n\n\u201cSurging activity on the Bitcoin network is causing profitability to recover to levels consistent with the start of previous bullish cycles. The network is still expensive relative to transaction values but less so than at the start of February,\u201d wrote Jamie Douglas Coutts, senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, in a research note shared with Forkast.\n\nMaxwell Goldstein, the co-founder of Freeport, an on-chain fine art investment platform, said that this week\u2019s price action was mainly driven by the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy decision.\n\nThe Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate by an expected 25 basis points on Wednesday. Bitcoin slid 1.94% to US$27,676 the day after the rate hike, also pressured by market concern of a banking crisis after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government is not considering a \u201cblanket insurance\u201d on bank deposits.\n\n\u201cTraders are flocking to Bitcoin and similar assets to diversify their holdings. Recent bank failures have also strengthened the case for investing in Bitcoin, along with murmurs of hyperinflation,\u201d wrote Goldstein, adding that due to looming fears of inflation, \u201cinvestors are absolutely seeking a safe haven asset and Bitcoin fits the bill.\u201d\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.17 trillion on Friday at 9:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 2.6% from US$1.14 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$537 billion market cap accounted for 46.3% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$216 billion accounted for 18.6%.\n\nBanks vs Bitcoin\n\n\u201cThe past several months have seen efforts by officials to cut liquidity from the crypto ecosystem, underscoring why Bitcoin matters and how desperate central planners are to keep the fiat credit system from imploding,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoutts was referring to recent black swan events like the liquidation of crypto-focused bank Silvergate, which provided lending services for large crypto companies like Coinbase and Crypto.com.\n\nTwo other crypto-friendly banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, also closed operations in the same week, resulting in market concern that crypto exchanges and companies could go unbanked.\n\nFormer congressman and Signature Bank board member Barney Frank told CNBC on March 13 that the bank\u2019s closure meant that \u201cregulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message.\u201d\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said the following day that Signature\u2019s closure had nothing to do with crypto and that the decision was \u201cbased on the current status of the bank and its ability to do business in a safe and sound manner.\u201d\n\nCoutts disagreed with the regulator, saying that Signature\u2019s shutdown was a deliberate message for the crypto industry.\n\n\u201cThe bank [Signature Bank] was still meeting withdrawal requests, and [the bank\u2019s] board member Barney Frank said regulators \u2018wanted to send a message to get people away from crypto,'\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\n\u201cThe statement by Frank marries with the data,\u201d added Coutts. \u201cBased on the last reported numbers, unrealized losses from held-to-maturity assets for Signature Bank were 27.4% of book value, below the average for the S&P 500 banks industry group at 36.6%.\u201d\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said that Bitcoin has always performed well during tumultuous times.\n\n\u201cIt would have been reasonable to assume Bitcoin might behave similarly when three crypto-facing banks \u2013 Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank \u2013 collapsed one after another,\u201d he said. Instead of a sharp decline in price, Bitcoin slipped and began to rise. \u201cIf people can\u2019t trust banks, Bitcoin would be a beneficiary.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestors are scrambling to find safe havens. Gold increased to US$2,000 per ounce. We\u2019ve also seen the world choose Bitcoin as a safe haven,\u201d added Stadelmann.\n\nJonas Betz, a Germany-based crypto analyst, said that Bitcoin was created to hedge against a failing banking system but warned that the closure of crypto banks may lead to a liquidity shortage.\n\n\u201cThe recent closure of operations by Silvergate and Signature has resulted in a significant reduction in liquidity in the crypto markets. These banks provided systems (SEN and Signet) that were important for facilitating the entry of fiat currency into the crypto market. With limited options available, the industry is likely to face a liquidity crunch until new banks step in. This leads to increased volatility in crypto prices,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nSee related article: Centralized intermediaries were cause of crypto failures in 2022, says Voorhees\n\nBiggest gainers: MASK & FLR\n\nMASK, the governance token of Mask Network, a mobile app and browser extension that aims to bridge Web 2.0 with Web 3.0, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. The MASK token rose 35.43% to US$6.13 and started picking up momentum on Thursday, after it was listed on CoinMarketCap.\n\nFLR, the utility token of interoperability-focused layer-1 blockchain Flare Network, was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 15.42% to US$$0.03327. The token started gaining momentum on March 17, after Flare announced the first of 36 monthly airdrops for the community.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin Fear & Greed index rises to 16-month high as investors seek safe-haven assets\n\nNext week: Bitcoin to US$30,000?\n\n\u201cThe 25% rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price from last Friday\u2019s lows has nearly eliminated losses of the previous 12 months for 72.41% of the network\u2019s BTC-holding entities,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nAt the start of 2022, some 75% of these entities were profitable. Today, with Bitcoin prices lower than a year ago, the average cost for a Bitcoin entity is lower than price. This has resulted in higher profitability,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nSlava Demchuk, the co-founder of AMLBot, a developer of crypto anti-money laundering software, said that investors should monitor the impact of the Fed\u2019s interest rate hike on banks and financial institutions.\n\n\u201cIf [banks] continue to struggle, the Fed may persist in reducing interest rates, which would facilitate even more capital into the economy. This scenario would also impact cryptocurrency prices, as they often reflect these changes faster than the other financial assets,\u201d wrote Demchuk.\n\nFreeport\u2019s Goldstein expects more Bitcoin volatility as the banking crisis unfolds.\n\n\u201cPrices will likely not break through the US$30,000 mark unless another major threat to the U.S. banking system comes into play. If the Fed continues to hike interest rates, Bitcoin will face increased downward pressure,\u201d wrote Goldstein.\n\nAlex Reinhardt, the founder of the financial education platform Reinhardt Academy, said that further banking issues could propel Bitcoin above US$30,000.\n\n\u201cReaching US$30,000 in the next week and US$35,000 in the next 2-3 weeks seems realistic. As we\u2019ve seen in the past, strong growth waves in the crypto market can quickly turn into an avalanche-like movement, triggering both panic sales and panic buying,\u201d wrote Reinhardt.\n\nMarat Minkin, the co-founder of DeFi payment app TONBanking, expects Bitcoin\u2019s safe haven narrative to fuel its rally to above US$30,000.\n\n\u201cKey price level remains at US$28,600-28,750. Bitcoin\u2019s uptrend will continue next week, and the U-turn will be completed at US$32,000 by the end of the next week to close the month with a positive monthly gain,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSee related article: Banks are bringing systemic risks to crypto, says Circle\u2019s Disparte"
