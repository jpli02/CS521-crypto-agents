        "title": "Crypto Industry Destined to Be Bitcoin Focused After SEC Actions: MicroStrategy Founder Michael Saylor - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Business-intelligence firm MicroStrategy's (MSTR) Founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has said recent enforcement actions by U.S. regulators have made it clear that the crypto industry is destined to be rationalized down to a bitcoin (BTC)-focused industry.\n\n\"MicroStrategy's views since 2020 have been that the only institutional grade asset is bitcoin,\" said Saylor in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday. \"It's pretty clear that the regulators don't see a legitimate path forward for cryptocurrencies ... And so the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to a bitcoin-focused industry with maybe half a dozen to a dozen other proof of work tokens.\"\n\nLast week, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, the two largest crypto exchanges by market cap. A total of 19 tokens have been mentioned in the filings. Bitcoin isn't one of them. Previously, SEC chair Gary Gensler has said that bitcoin (BTC) is a commodity.\n\nSaylor's MicroStrategy began buying bitcoin in 2020 while calling the cryptocurrency a million times better store of value than gold. The company now holds approximately 140,000 bitcoin worth about $4 billion. In March 2023, Saylor lost a bid to dismiss claims that he failed to pay personal income taxes, interest and penalties due for Washington, D.C. However, the court dismissed claims that Saylor and MicroStrategy had conspired to violate the law.\n\nRegulatory clarity is going to drive #Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion & anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors. Bitcoin dominance will continue to grow as the #Crypto industry rationalizes around $BTC and goes mainstream. pic.twitter.com/Foq4lpderj \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) June 13, 2023\n\nSaylor said that since 25,000 other cryptocurrencies (approximately) have been angling to position themselves as bitcoin or a better bitcoin, the public now understands that bitcoin is the next bitcoin. He said the \"next logical step\" is for bitcoin to multiply 10 times in value to $250,000.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Eventually, I have confidence that the crypto exchanges will come around to realising that bitcoin really is the dominant asset in this space, and their business models are fine when bitcoin goes up by a factor of 10,\" Saylor said.\n\nRead More: MicroStrategy Founder Michael Saylor Loses Court Bid to Dismiss DC Tax Evasion Claims\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether, top 10 crypto in red amid thinner trading, Fed warning of more rate hikes - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Thursday morning trading in Asia, dropping below US$25,000 at one stage for the first time since mid-March. Ether also retreated with other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies as trading volumes dipped and the U.S. Fed left interest rates unchanged as expected, but warned of more hikes this year to tackle inflation. Ripple\u2019s XRP token fell despite the release of documents this week that were expected to help the company\u2019s defense in an SEC lawsuit.\n\nCrypto in red\n\nBitcoin fell 2.94% over the last 24 hours to US$25,062.60 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 4.69% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about US$490 billion, dipped below the US$25,000 support line to as low as US$24,902 earlier in the morning.\n\nEther fell 4.74% to US$1,652.25, posting a 9.70% loss for the week. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nCardano dropped 4.10% to US$0.2624, losing 18.57% of its value in the past seven days. Solana fell 3.18% to US$14.44 and posted a weekly loss of 22.52%.\n\nThe two tokens have been on a downtrend since being named in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit filed last week against the Binance.US and Coinbase exchanges, where the federal agency categorized the two \u2014 along with many other altcoins \u2014 as financial securities.\n\nBenjamin Stani, the director of business development and sales at crypto trading platform Matrixport, said the declines are mostly the overhang from the SEC suing Binance and Coinbase.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been predominantly the altcoins that have been dropping,\u201d said Stani. \u201cBTC and, to some extent, ETH as well have been holding up better and that I think is mostly attributable to the fact that the SEC named a lot of [altcoins] as securities and that has this chilling effect.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as expected on Wednesday at 5% to 5.25% after ten consecutive hikes to curb inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in another negative for investors, Fed chair Jerome Powell said it may take years to get inflation under control, dousing expectations for rate cuts later this year and raising the likelihood of higher interest rates ahead. Stocks ended mixed.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the losers in the crypto top 10 by market capitalization, falling 7.48% to US$0.4793 on the day for a weekly loss of 7.19%.\n\nThe declines came despite the release of the so-called \u201cHinman documents,\u201d this week, a collection of previously sealed emails and pages from former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman. The notes indicate that Ether should not be categorized as a financial security.\n\nRipple Labs Inc. was sued by the SEC in December 2020 on allegations XRP was sold as an illegal unregistered security. Ripple wanted the Hinman documents made public, arguing they show the SEC itself was sending mixed and confused signals over whether cryptocurrencies were securities and failing to offer clear guidance to the industry, which is part of Ripple\u2019s fair notice defense in the case.\n\nHowever, XRP\u2019s price hasn\u2019t benefited from the release of the documents. Gabriel Shapiro, a U.S.-based attorney and the general counsel at blockchain firm Delphi Labs, wrote on Twitter Tuesday \u2014 \u201c\u200b\u200bHinman emails are a nothingburger though great for Ether. No idea why Ripple thinks these emails help Ripple\u2019s case.\u201d\n\nShapiro added that the documents were not the bombshell compared to the \u201chuge hype\u201d given to them.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap lost 2.76% to US$1.02 trillion in the last 24 hours, and the daily crypto trading volume fell 5.37% to US$31.89 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT on downtrend\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 0.86% to 2,912.74 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.64% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions rose 0.13% to US$23.7 million, while sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain by volume, fell 4.78% over the last 24 hours to US$13.52 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nThe Bitcoin network was the second largest NFT network in terms of transactions, rising 6.95% to US$4.1 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe recent buzz in the NFT community is around ERC-6551, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. ERC-6551 is the latest NFT standard for the Ethereum network that went into effect on May 7 this year.\n\n\u201cERC-6551 is introducing a standard for NFTs by unlocking their ability to be a smart wallet that can interact with different decentralized apps in the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cWith ERC-6551, when you transfer an NFT, the wallet and the tokens that the NFT holds also goes with it. Basically wallets within wallets.\u201d\n\nAbout 196 million of Blur tokens worth around US$62 million, 40% of the circulating supply, are being unlocked and distributed to investors and contributors on Wednesday, U.S. time. Blur is the native utility and governance tokens of the Blur NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201c[This] will almost definitely cause a crash in price, which will impact NFT prices,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cBasically, if the token is devalued, will people still want to farm for it via trading NFTs?\u201d\n\nTransactions of Uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 topped sales by collection, selling US$3.14 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum-based BoringPunks marked second with US$1.63 million in sales, with over 20,000 transactions in the past day.\n\nU.S. equity futures edge down\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after a mixed regular trading day on Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.09%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.06% lower and Nasdaq Futures lost 0.09%.\n\nThe U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% after its meeting on Wednesday. The rate is at its highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage last year.\n\nHowever, post-meeting comments from Powell hinted at two more rate hikes by the end of this year, while stating that rate cuts will not happen unless inflation is under control. That didn\u2019t go down well with some business leaders.\n\n\u201cThe battle against inflation is being won. This is now the time for the Fed to stop \u2013 not pause \u2013 interest rate hikes,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an email statement.\n\n\u201cThe time lag for monetary policies is notoriously long \u2014 it typically takes about 18 months to two years for the full effect of rate hikes to filter fully into the economy,\u201d Green said, adding that excessive rate hikes could lead to a recession in the U.S.\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for July 25 to 26.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 30.6% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at July\u2019s meeting, while 69.4% says the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points.\n\n(Updates with equities section)"

        "content": "Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. The technology behind Bitcoin is known as a blockchain, which is a decentralized, public ledger that records all of the transactions on the network.\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin significant in the financial world is its unique characteristics and potential impact, one of them including decentralization. This decentralization provides several advantages, such as reducing the risk of censorship, enabling global accessibility, and fostering financial inclusion for those who are unbanked or underbanked.\n\nAnother significant feature of Bitcoin is its limited supply. Since there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, that makes it a deflationary asset. Additionally, the limited supply and the decentralized nature of Bitcoin contribute to its perceived value and the potential for price appreciation over time.\n\nUtilizing blockchain technology in Bitcoin transactions ensures transparency and immutability, thereby rendering the alteration or manipulation of transaction records a challenging task.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has gained attention as an alternative investment and a diversification tool. It has attracted interest from institutional investors, hedge funds, and even some governments. This growing acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin have led to the emergence of regulated exchanges, investment products, and services around cryptocurrency.\n\nEnrico Rubboli, the CEO of Mintlayer, told Nasdaq, \u201cInvestment firms recognize Bitcoin's potential as a store of value and inflation hedge.

Its price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and concerns about its use in illicit activities have raised questions about its stability and long-term viability as a mainstream currency. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has undeniably disrupted traditional financial systems and sparked a broader interest in blockchain technology.\n\nIt has stimulated innovation in various industries beyond finance, including supply chain management, voting systems, and decentralized applications. The potential for old institutions to change, for people to gain financial independence, and for the global economy to challenge the status quo of centralized control make Bitcoin significant in the financial world.\n\nInstitutional adoption of Bitcoin: Key players and their motivations\n\nInstitutional adoption of Bitcoin has seen significant growth, with key players from various sectors embracing cryptocurrency. These players include financial institutions, technology companies, and investment firms, each driven by unique motivations.\n\nFinancial institutions, including banks and asset management companies, have been actively exploring Bitcoin adoption. Their motivations include:\n\nDiversification and Portfolio Management: Financial institutions seek to diversify their investment portfolios by including Bitcoin. They view cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class that can potentially provide attractive returns and reduce overall portfolio risk. Client Demand and Retention: Many clients have expressed interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Financial institutions aim to meet this demand and retain their clients by offering cryptocurrency-related services and investment opportunities. Failing to address this demand could result in losing clients to competitors.

They view Bitcoin as a speculative investment opportunity that can yield significant profits if properly managed. Portfolio Diversification: Investment firms aim to diversify their investment strategies by adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. By diversifying across different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, they can minimize risk and potentially enhance overall portfolio performance. Store of Value and Inflation Hedge: Some investment firms perceive Bitcoin as a digital store of value similar to gold.
