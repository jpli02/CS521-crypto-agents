        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs: What Makes BTC JPEGs so Extra-Ordinal? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Whether you call them Bitcoin NFTs, digital artifacts, or Ordinals, these new JPEGs are brewing up a storm and making waves across the crypto space. With Bitcoin Punks selling for upwards of 1.1 BTC (17.50 ETH), non-fungible tokens on the bitcoin blockchain are not to be ignored.\n\nSince when has the Bitcoin network become the hottest place to trade NFTs? What does this mean for BTC transaction fees, and why is the Bitcoin community against all this newfound interest?\n\nMost importantly, which Bitcoin NFT collection will be the next Bored Apes, and how can I buy these trending digital assets?\n\nWhat Are BTC Ordinals?\n\nThe Ordinal protocol allows users to inscribe data, like an image or file, onto an individual satoshi. In the same way that 100 cents make up one dollar, 100,000,000 satoshis = 1 BTC. Casey Rodarmor, the founder behind the protocol, claims that these digital artifacts \u201creflect what NFTs should be.\u201d\n\nWhile upgradeable NFT standards and enforceable royalties have become popular on other blockchains, Bitcoin NFTs are truly immutable, permissionless, and censorship-resistant. This leads to some creative use cases, as speculated by the wider Bitcoin community:\n\nBitcoin NFTs are slightly different from their cousins over on Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Ordinal NFTs store the entirety of the inscribed data directly on-chain instead of simply linking a JPEG to a non-fungible token.\n\nAll this was made possible following a loophole Casey Rodarmor discovered in the latest Bitcoin Taproot upgrade. Limited only by block size, data can now be stored on-chain on the world\u2019s most decentralized blockchain. What\u2019s more, the protocol doesn\u2019t really on any smart contracts. While this arguably streamlines the protocol, it complicates future utilities like DeFi integrations.\n\nAre Ordinals the First Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nDespite what the newer generation of cryptocurrency enthusiasts might believe, this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen NFTs on the bitcoin network. Crypto veterans will remember NameCoin NFTs, which, while not quite resembling today\u2019s Apes and Punks, are widely considered the first non-fungible tokens.\n\nIn 2015, the Counterparty network hosted NFT trading card games and the now-iconic RarePepe Card Collection. While these early NFTs are technically considered Counterparty NFTs, they used bitcoin network functions to anchor references on the original blockchain, giving them their place in Bitcoin history.\n\nBitcoin Community and JPEGs: More Controversy\n\nLike any revolutionary new technology, Bitcoin NFTs have divided the Bitcoin community into two camps. Bitcoin maximalists have shunned Ordinals from the outset, arguing that BTC is a financial instrument. They believe that adding Ordinal NFTs into the mix only corrupts the network and dilutes the value of the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin NFTs have arguably brought renewed interest to the network and raised the ceiling on potential use cases for Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals add an additional layer of culture and history to the bitcoin archives, while also benefitting BTC miners thanks to boosted transaction fees. Network congestion leads to limited block space and a spike in BTC gas.\n\nComplications with Bitcoin NFTs\n\nBefore strapping on your FOMO boots and diving into the non-existent Bitcoin Metaverse, there are a few things you need to know. The Ordinal NFT ecosystem is still in its infancy and demands a high level of technical knowledge to navigate effectively.\n\nFirst of all, there is no NFT marketplace on the bitcoin network. All Ordinal NFT trades are completed through trusted peer-to-peer trades in Discord servers and telegram channels. As is often the case, these trading environments attract plenty of scammers and nefarious actors.\n\nIf you\u2019re trading Bitcoin NFTs OTC, do your due diligence and use a reliable middleman or intermediary.\n\nAs if the barrier to entry wasn\u2019t already high enough, things just get more complex. You can\u2019t sell, transfer or trade a native Ordinal NFT unless you\u2019re running a full bitcoin node on your computer. Setting up a node isn\u2019t easy, and syncing it up with the bitcoin network can take up to three days.\n\nFortunately, there is an easier way to create a Bitcoin NFT. Sites like Ordinals.bot and Gamma.io simplify the process but severely limit your BTC transactions. Unless you\u2019re running a node, you still won\u2019t be able to sell or transfer your NFT.\n\nFinally, you can currently only hold one Ordinal NFT per bitcoin wallet. What\u2019s more, if you accidentally send the satoshi that your Bitcoin NFT is inscribed on, you\u2019ll lose it forever, even if you\u2019re sending it to a trusted crypto exchange like Binance.\n\nDiving into the world of Bitcoin NFTs is a bit of a jungle. The high barrier to entry has only added to the scarcity and FOMO surrounding these digital artifacts, which have been exploding on crypto news platforms. Thankfully, there are a few workarounds that make things easier.\n\nHow to Trade BTC Ordinals on Ethereum\n\nThere is a solution if you\u2019re itching to get your hands on a Bitcoin NFT but don\u2019t have the technical knowledge or time to go through the exhausting Ordinal onboarding process.\n\nEmblem Vaults are a unique approach to NFT trading that allows users to package data from other chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin into an Ethereum NFT. Each Emblem Vault contains private keys for data, like NFTs, that are stored on other blockchains. Emblem Vaults make it possible to trade NFTs from other networks like Bitcoin and Solana as if they were Ethereum NFTs.\n\nOne could argue that this represents peak irony in the crypto space. Even after all these years and all the progress the industry has witnessed, we\u2019re still generating Ethereum-native punk art on other chains. This isn\u2019t a new idea, but this is the first time we\u2019ve started repackaging these outsider punks to resell them on Ethereum.\n\nAs always, buying Emblem Vaults on Opensea carries an element of risk. Because anything can be coded into an Emblem Vault, it\u2019s difficult to know if the vault you\u2019re looking at contains a genuine Bitcoin Punk. Seeing the same Ordinal NFT listed three times in a row undoubtedly raises some red flags.\n\nIt\u2019s recommended to always conduct thorough research before buying any Emblem Vaults claiming to contain Bitcoin NFTs. Otherwise, you find yourself chalking up more capital losses on your crypto taxes.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOrdinal NFTs are the latest gold rush in the crypto market; however, the high barrier to entry makes it difficult to navigate and gives scammers and bad actors a platform to take advantage of unaware users.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nBitcoin NFTs are increasing network congestion on the Bitcoin network. While this is great for Bitcoin miners, regular users suffer from higher transaction fees and network congestion.\n\nFAQs"
