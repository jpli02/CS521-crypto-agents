        "content": "Turmoil in the banking sector, hotter-than expected inflation data, and renewed hopes for a dovish Federal Reserve has Bitcoin reaching levels not seen in about nine months.\n\nThe largest digital coin topped $28,000 for the first time since June 2022, trading at around $28,200 at 9:45 a.m in London on Monday. Bitcoin is now up more than 70% since the start of the year. Other tokens have rallied as well, with Ether gaining almost 50% since Dec. 31 and Solana, one of last year\u2019s most beaten-down coins, more than doubling."

        "content": "Mark Cuban told Bill Maher that buying gold is \u2018dumb\u2019 \u2014 and he wants bitcoin to plunge so he can buy even more. These are 3 simple ways to gain crypto exposure\n\nBeing a crypto bull has its challenges. Even though bitcoin has surged in 2023, it's still down more than 60% from its peak of $68,789 reached in November 2021.\n\nBut one billionaire investor still likes the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency: Mark Cuban.\n\nDon't miss\n\n\u201cI want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more,\u201d Cuban said in a recent episode of Bill Maher\u2019s Club Random podcast.\n\nMaher, who self-claims to be \u201cvery anti-bitcoin,\u201d owns gold instead. Cuban, conversely, has no time for the yellow metal.\n\n\u201cIf you have gold, you're dumb as f\u2014,\u201d says the Shark Tank star and Dallas Mavericks owner.\n\nMaher argues that gold \u201cis like a hedge against everything else\u201d but Cuban disagrees.\n\n\u201cGold is not a hedge against anything, right? What it is is a store of value and you don't own the physical gold, do you \u2026 Gold is a store of value and so is Bitcoin,\u201d Cuban explains.\n\nHe then points out why gold can\u2019t really protect your wealth in times of crisis.\n\n\u201cYou don't own the gold bar, and if everything went to hell in a handbasket and you had a gold bar, you know what would happen? Someone would beat the f\u2014 out of you or kill you and take your gold bar.\u201d\n\nIf you share Cuban\u2019s view, here are a few ways to gain exposure to bitcoin.\n\nBuy bitcoin directly\n\nThe first option is the most straightforward: If you want to buy Bitcoin, just buy Bitcoin.\n\nThese days, many platforms allow individual investors to buy and sell crypto. Just be aware that some exchanges charge up to 4% commission fees for each transaction. So look for apps that charge low or even no commissions.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Bitcoin commands a five-figure price tag today, there\u2019s no need to buy a whole coin. Most exchanges allow you to start with as much money as you are willing to spend.\n\nRead more: Here's how much money the average middle-class American household makes \u2014 how do you stack up?\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nExchange-traded funds have risen in popularity in recent years. They trade on stock exchanges, so buying and selling them is very convenient. And now, investors can use them to get a piece of the bitcoin action, too.\n\nFor instance, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) started trading on NYSE Arca in October 2021, marking the first U.S. bitcoin-linked ETF on the market. The fund holds bitcoin futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and has an expense ratio of 0.95%.\n\nInvestors can also consider the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which made its debut a few days after BITO. This Nasdaq-listed ETF invests in bitcoin futures contracts and charges an expense ratio of 0.95%.\n\nBitcoin stocks\n\nWhen companies tie some of their growth to the crypto market, their shares can often move in tandem with the coins.\n\nFirst, there are bitcoin miners. The computing power doesn\u2019t come cheap and energy costs can be substantial. But if the price of bitcoin goes up, miners like Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) are likely to receive increased attention from investors.\n\nThen there are intermediaries like Coinbase Global (COIN) and PayPal (PYPL). When more people buy, sell and use crypto, these platforms stand to benefit.\n\nFinally, there are companies that simply hold a lot of crypto on their balance sheets.\n\nCase in point: enterprise software technologist MicroStrategy (MSTR). It has a market cap of under $3 billion. Yet its bitcoin count reached approximately 132,500 as of Dec. 27, 2022, a stockpile worth around $3.4 billion.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "title": "How Realistic Is Former Coinbase CTO's $2 Million Bitcoin Wager on US Hyperinflation? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Coinbase\u2019s former CTO Balaji Srinivasan wagered on Friday that the price of Bitcoin will benefit from a rapid devaluing of the U.S. dollar in the next three months, skyrocketing to $1 million by June 17.\n\nSrinivasan entered a bet with two individuals that same day, ponying up $1 million with the pseudonymous Twitter pundit James Medlock and another unnamed person. If Bitcoin fails to notch what would be historic gains, the two would receive $1 million in Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin each.\n\nThe bet is part of Srinivasan\u2019s view that the global economy is teetering on the edge of rapid change, which he dubbed \u201chyperbitcoinization.\u201d He predicts the U.S. dollar will enter a point of rapid hyperinflation, and the global economy then \u201credenominates on Bitcoin as digital gold.\u201d\n\nIn this scenario, the market capitalization of Bitcoin\u2014already the largest token\u2014would increase to around $19.3 trillion from about $549 billion today, according to CoinGecko. For comparison, the value of the U.S. stock market was just over $40.5 trillion by the end of last year, according to Siblis Research.\n\nSrinivasan\u2019s prediction comes amid a series of bank failures in the U.S. that\u2019s injected fear and uncertainty into financial markets. And even though Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to stock indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remains significant, some on Twitter are calling it the \u201cThe Great Decoupling\u201d given Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge past $28,000 as Wall Street wavers.\n\nThe bold bet inspired lengthy Twitter threads from some of crypto Twitter\u2019s most prominent voices, including Bitcoin entrepreneur and educator Jimmy Song and venture capitalist Adam Cochran, who delved into how realistic the prediction could be.\n\nReferencing the performance of cryptocurrencies during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Cochran said that Bitcoin would need a catalyst more extreme than that to outdo the 547% rally seen from 2020 to 2022.\n\n3/25 The bet here, is that within 90 days, Bitcoin will reach a price of $1M USD. Or around a 3600% gain within the next 90 days. To put that in perspective, the rally from 2020 - 2022 was only 547% and the 2017 rally at far lower prices was only 1105% gain. pic.twitter.com/7OZZHXNgYX \u2014 Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) March 18, 2023\n\nStory continues\n\nCochran posited that a collapse of the United States and Europe\u2019s banking systems would ultimately overshadow the potential value of Bitcoin as an asset, making bunkers or beans a better use of money than purchasing the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cSimply put, stores of value or alternative assets do well when we doubt the profitability of an economic system and not the existence of a system,\u201d he told Decrypt via Twitter DM. \u201cIf the system doesn\u2019t exist, we shift down the hierarchy of needs, placing value on necessity goods, not valuables.\u201d\n\nCochran said Srinivasan\u2019s wager is a bid for hope in the crypto market after the industry faced tough sledding as crypto winter set in last year, a time when prices plummeted and numerous crypto firms collapsed. He noted that the digital assets industry lost a lot of the excitement and hope that brought people in.\n\n\u201cThey are hungry to have that back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just disappointing to see it fueled by an unrealistic bet in such a risky macro environment.\u201d\n\nOther voices, such as Song, appeared supportive of ideas expressed Srinivasan\u2019s bet, claiming Bitcoin could have some utility during an existential crisis for the financial system as it\u2019s known today.\n\n\u201cBitcoin will play a crucial role in mitigating some of the catastrophic effects,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a strictly limited currency, Bitcoin offers a much better store of value, dampening the impact of hyperinflation.\u201d\n\n5/\ud83c\udf10 Despite the daunting situation, Bitcoin will play a crucial role in mitigating some of the catastrophic effects. As a strictly limited currency, Bitcoin offers a much better store of value, dampening the impact of hyperinflation. \u2014 Jimmy Song (\uc1a1\uc7ac\uc900) (@jimmysong) March 19, 2023\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Matt Levine chimed in on Saturday to ask what could be considered a straightforward question: If Srinivasan thinks Bitcoin will reach $1 million in 90 days, why would he use the money to make a bet about it as opposed to just buying Bitcoin?\n\nthe replies are all \u201cno, he\u2019s printing a futures trade way above market to manipulate the price up\u201d which is not better \u2014 Matt Levine (@matt_levine) March 18, 2023\n\nLevine said in a subsequent Tweet that Srinivasan\u2019s move could be an attempt to \u201cmanipulate the price [of Bitcoin] up\u201d based on the replies he received. Others expressed the idea that Srinivasan could\u2019ve made the bet as a way to bring exposure to himself and Bitcoin.\n\nSrinivasan\u2019s net worth is estimated to be around $150 million, according to Datawallet. He had joined Coinbase after a company he co-founded called Earn.com\u2014which rewarded users with digital assets for completing small tasks\u2014was purchased by Coinbase.\n\nSrinivasan worked at Coinbase for around 14 months before leaving the exchange in May 2019. Among the accomplishments listed on his LinkedIn profile, he was responsible for organizing the \u201cbusiness and technical sides\u201d of Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin launch.\n\nSrinivasan is not the only person out there who has envisioned a $1 million price per Bitcoin. In January of last year, Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest estimated that Bitcoin could exceed $1 million by 2030, saying the network \u201cis likely to scale as nation-states adopt [Bitcoin] as legal tender.\u201d"
