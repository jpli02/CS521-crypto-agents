Ether also treaded water, as other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed with Solana leading the winners. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged lower and U.S. stock futures moved up following losses last week.

Investors will find it very hard to position themselves, though, as positive news about crypto ETFs and engagement by institutions are balanced by regulatory woes and DeFi hacks,\u201d added d\u2019Anethan.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed as Solana led the winners. It gained 2.51% to US$23.18, but logged a weekly loss of 4.47%.\n\nDogecoin led the losers, falling 1.97% to US$0.07418, down 4.92% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.12% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while trading volume gained little, adding 1.42% to US$20.62 billion.\n\nMore doom and gloom for NFT developers\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

(@WreckLeagueHQ) August 4, 2023\n\nThat agreement will see Yuga Labs\u2019 NFT collections incorporated into the game. The game will be launched in September.\n\nAccording to a Sunday report by the Bored Ape Gazette, a news site funded by the ApeCoin DAO, Wreck League\u2019s in-game NFTs will be minted exclusively with ApeCoin. ApeCoin is the governance and utility token used in the Yuga Labs ecosystem.\n\nFollowing the news, ApeCoin\u2019s price rose to a weekly high of US$2.04 on Sunday, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nElsewhere, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning Saturday about NFT phishing scams. The FBI claims that fraudsters, posing as NFT developers, are using fake social media accounts to trick users into linking their digital wallets to smart contracts that extract their digital funds.\n\nAnd the bad news for developers isn\u2019t over.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report published Saturday, total NFT royalties received by creators plunged from US$269 million in January 2022 to only US4.3 million in July 2023.\n\nA significant decline in NFT trades coupled with competition between NFT marketplaces OpenSea and Blur has drastically driven down royalty rates. The total NFT trading volume fell more than 90% over the same period, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nU.S. labor market cools\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:10 p.m. on Monday in Hong Kong. The three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower in regular trading last Friday and ended the week with losses.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes moved down on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses.\n\nThe U.S. economy added 187,000 payrolls in July, lower than analyst expectations. Hourly average wages also logged a higher-than-expected increase of 4.4%, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nThat data points to a cooling U.S. labor market. However, wage inflation is still double the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s target level.\n\n\u2018Today\u2019s numbers will do little to change the narrative of the Fed. The earnings numbers in particular will be of concern to the \u2018hawks\u2019 on the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) and will do nothing to dissuade them from arguing for another interest rate hike at September\u2019s meeting,\u201d Stuart Cole, Equiti Capital\u2019s head macro economist told Reuters.\n\nInvestors now await the U.S. July consumer price index (CPI) on Thursday and producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Both reports will provide insight into U.S. inflation and the direction of the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed meets on September 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 86.5% chance for no interest rate hike in September, and a 13.5% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 17.5% on Friday.\n\nThis week will also be busy with second-quarter earning reports from major corporations including Walt Disney, Alibaba Group Holdings and Honda Motor.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s imports and exports data is expected Tuesday, as well as the country\u2019s CPI and PPI on Wednesday. Analysts expect the Chinese CPI and PPI to pose annual decreases in July.\n\n(Updates to add equities section.)"

Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained Cards made up the second and third place spots.\n\nWreck League, an NFT-based fighting game backed by Web3 venture capital and game development firm Animoca Brands, announced a licensing agreement with BAYC developer Yuga Labs on Thursday.\n\n\ud83d\udcfaTake a closer look at our first collaboration with @yugalabs and discover the exclusive advantages of being part of the next generation of fighting games!\n\n\n\n\u25b6\ufe0fPowered by @apecoin \ud83e\uddbe pic.twitter.com/pvxAQHLTTf \u2014 Wreck League \u27a1\ufe0fALLOWLIST OPEN! (@WreckLeagueHQ) August 4, 2023\n\nThat agreement will see Yuga Labs\u2019 NFT collections incorporated into the game. The game will be launched in September.\n\nAccording to a Sunday report by the Bored Ape Gazette, a news site funded by the ApeCoin DAO, Wreck League\u2019s in-game NFTs will be minted exclusively with ApeCoin. ApeCoin is the governance and utility token used in the Yuga Labs ecosystem.\n\nFollowing the news, ApeCoin\u2019s price rose to a weekly high of US$2.04 on Sunday, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nElsewhere, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning Saturday about NFT phishing scams. The FBI claims that fraudsters, posing as NFT developers, are using fake social media accounts to trick users into linking their digital wallets to smart contracts that extract their digital funds.\n\nAnd the bad news for developers isn\u2019t over.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report published Saturday, total NFT royalties received by creators plunged from US$269 million in January 2022 to only US4.3 million in July 2023.\n\nA significant decline in NFT trades coupled with competition between NFT marketplaces OpenSea and Blur has drastically driven down royalty rates. The total NFT trading volume fell more than 90% over the same period, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nU.S. labor market cools\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:10 p.m. on Monday in Hong Kong. The three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower in regular trading last Friday and ended the week with losses.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes moved down on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses.\n\nThe U.S. economy added 187,000 payrolls in July, lower than analyst expectations. Hourly average wages also logged a higher-than-expected increase of 4.4%, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nThat data points to a cooling U.S. labor market. However, wage inflation is still double the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s target level.\n\n\u2018Today\u2019s numbers will do little to change the narrative of the Fed. The earnings numbers in particular will be of concern to the \u2018hawks\u2019 on the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) and will do nothing to dissuade them from arguing for another interest rate hike at September\u2019s meeting,\u201d Stuart Cole, Equiti Capital\u2019s head macro economist told Reuters.\n\nInvestors now await the U.S. July consumer price index (CPI) on Thursday and producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Both reports will provide insight into U.S. inflation and the direction of the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed meets on September 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 86.5% chance for no interest rate hike in September, and a 13.5% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 17.5% on Friday.\n\nThis week will also be busy with second-quarter earning reports from major corporations including Walt Disney, Alibaba Group Holdings and Honda Motor.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s imports and exports data is expected Tuesday, as well as the country\u2019s CPI and PPI on Wednesday. Analysts expect the Chinese CPI and PPI to pose annual decreases in July.\n\n(Updates to add equities section.)"
