        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoiners rejoiced this week when KPMG, one of the \u201cbig four\u201d worldwide accounting firms, published a report that underscored how the protocol can contribute in a positive manner to the three pillars of the ESG investing framework: environmental, social, and governance.\n\nKPMG\u2019s research is pivotal, says CH4 Capital co-founder and renowned ESG analyst, Daniel Batten.\n\n\u201cNo matter what your view on ESG, demonstrating how Bitcoin makes positive contributions [to environment, social and governance initiatives] is critical to both mainstream and institutional comfort,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Batten, the KPMG report\u2014titled \u201cBitcoin\u2019s role in the ESG Imperative\u201d\u2014is an \u201cimportant moment, because it represents for the first time a mainstream financial institution having gone through a thorough due diligence process on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe report documents a deep dive in the framework\u2019s three pillars, beginning with the environmental aspect of Bitcoin mining\u2013the energy intensive and controversial process through which new BTC is created. KPMG says the mining industry \u201cis focused on driving towards Net Zero emissions.\u201d\n\nKPMG showcases how Bitcoin emissions compare to other key worldwide industries (such as tourism and fashion), elucidating it is a mere fraction. The publication outlines several strategies towards reducing the network's carbon footprint, including using renewable energy, and recycled heat among others.\n\nBatten, an expert on ESG matters, explained to Decrypt that he is surprised by the thoroughness of the report. \u201cIt's usual for reports to let certain folklore slip through the due diligence process such as \u2018but Bitcoin takes renewable energy away from other users,\u2019\u201d he said, praising the KPMG team for the quality of their research and publishing what he considers to be \u201cnon-obvious truths.\u201d\n\nThe social aspect of the report touches upon the hotly debated \u201cBitcoin is for criminals,\u201d narrative, pointing to a recent Chainalysis report. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly asserted that cryptocurrency is a favored tool of criminals, fueling societal ills like the fentanyl epidemic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKPMG countered these claims with the opportunities the protocol presents for financial inclusion, such as crowdfunding Ukraine\u2019s efforts in its war with Russia, providing access to electricity in Africa, and the role it plays for minorities around the world.\n\nLast but not least, KPMG addresses the governance aspect of Bitcoin, and the decentralized aspect of the network specifically, which it writes is one of its \u201cmost prominent features.\u201d The report acknowledges that the network\u2019s rules cannot be changed or modified by those in power, pointing to a \u201crobust\u201d governance structure that provides a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d in the overall system.\n\nThe report concludes that Bitcoin provides a number of positive benefits under an ESG investing framework, and ends with a series of questions for ecosystem players\u2013prompting users, miners and other organizations to assess their relationship to the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI think it's an important report and a milestone the ecosystem should celebrate,\u201d Batten tells Decrypt. He remarked that \u201cIt's important people read reports put out by Bitcoin opponents,\u201d although Batten reckons \u201cthere is still much work to be done, with several mainstream news channels continuing to publish misinformation about Bitcoin with impunity.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, however, that \u201cthis will improve education and help the intellectually curious person to form an informed viewpoint on the utility of Bitcoin.\u201d"

        "title": "Decoding Bitcoin halving: An in-depth look at the halving process and its impact - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Rajagopal Menon\n\nIn the realm of digital assets, Bitcoin stands out as a revolutionary innovation. Conceived as a store of value and a means of value transfer, Bitcoin has fundamentally transformed our understanding of what a digital asset can be. Prior to the invention of Bitcoin, digital files could only be replicated and never actually transferred. The concept of transferring ownership of a digital asset in a way that unambiguously assures that the original possessor no longer owns it was a complex problem that Bitcoin ingeniously solved. This solution lies in the immutable ledger of the blockchain, where each transaction is recorded in a transparent manner, allowing anyone to witness the debit and credit. One of the most intriguing parts of Bitcoin is the idea of \u2018Bitcoin halving.\u2019 For the first time in technology history, we have a digital asset that is designed to be rare, a feature that has far-reaching consequences for the future of digital currencies.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Limited Supply: A Key Feature\n\nA distinguishing characteristic of Bitcoin is its limited supply. Unlike traditional fiat currencies that can be printed at will, Bitcoin has a predetermined maximum supply of 21 million coins. To ensure the digital currency\u2019s scarcity and value, its creators made a deliberate design decision to limit its supply.\n\nBitcoin Halving: A Mechanism Ensuring Scarcity\n\nBitcoin\u2019s scarcity is maintained through a process known as Bitcoin halving. Approximately every four years, the number of new Bitcoins created through mining is cut in half. This reduction in the rate of new coin creation ensures that the supply grows at a decreasing pace, ultimately leading to a fixed maximum supply.\n\nThe Significance of Bitcoin Halving Events\n\nBitcoin halving is a significant event in the Bitcoin network that occurs once every 210,000 blocks. It is a process aimed at reducing the reward given to miners for validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. This reduction is done by 50% every halving event, thereby reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated. This means that the block reward will halve or decrease by half, which will give miners 3.125 of newly minted Bitcoin per validated block. Since a new block of transactions is completed roughly every 10 minutes, this works out to an average Bitcoin halving event every four years. The next halving will happen around April\u2013May 2024.\n\nThe limited supply of Bitcoin has had a profound impact on its value. As the demand for Bitcoins increases and the supply remains restricted, the scarcity factor amplifies its perceived value. This scarcity-driven value proposition has made Bitcoin a highly sought-after digital asset. Historically, in the months immediately following a halving event, Bitcoin pricing didn\u2019t show much movement. It usually started heating up around 12 to 18 months after a halving. However, it\u2019s not quite clear that the spikes in prices 12 to 18 months after the halving events actually correlate exclusively with the halving. Other forces could cause Bitcoin to spike or drop before or after the halving as well.\n\nImplications of Bitcoin Halving on the Ecosystem\n\nBitcoin halving events have profound implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. As the block reward decreases, miners are incentivized to compete more aggressively for the remaining reward. This can lead to increased mining difficulty and a higher level of network security. Additionally, halving events often trigger a surge in the price of Bitcoin, as the reduced supply creates a sense of scarcity and increased demand.\n\nThe impact of halving events extends beyond the immediate effects on miners and the price of Bitcoin. The reduction in block rewards also affects the economics of mining, as miners need to carefully manage their operational costs and revenue streams. Some miners may choose to exit the market altogether if the reduced rewards make mining unprofitable, while others may seek out more efficient mining hardware and strategies to maintain profitability.\n\nIncrease in consolidation in the industry also leads to establishment of mining groups resulting in their advantage over individual miners who cannot keep up with the operational costs. Also access to energy sources with minimal negative impact on the environment is a scarcity unless a big mining corporation manages to get their hands on it.\n\nSo while Bitcoin mining has its own benefits, some of the industry\u2019s older stakeholders might drop out as they cannot keep up with the demands.\n\nBitcoin Halving: A Recurring Event Shaping the Future\n\nBitcoin halving is a recurring event that plays a critical role in the Bitcoin network. It reduces the block reward received by miners, controls the rate of new Bitcoin creation, and influences various aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The history of halving events showcases the evolution of Bitcoin and its growing significance in the financial world. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, future halving events are expected to generate even more interest and shape the future of Bitcoin.\n\nThe author is vice-president, WazirX\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

        "title": "Bitcoin Power Players: Highlights From The Mining Disrupt Conference - ETF Trends",
        "content": "This annual event attracts the who\u2019s who of the digital asset mining industry, including top players, enthusiastic investors and Bitcoin advocates alike.\n\nI just returned from an invigorating week in hot and humid Miami, Florida, where I was privileged to present at the Mining Disrupt conference. This annual event attracts the who\u2019s who of the digital asset mining industry, including top players, enthusiastic investors and Bitcoin advocates alike.\n\nIn my capacity as Executive Chairman of HIVE Digital Technologies, I was excited to shed light on our company\u2019s involvement in the great digital transformation and expansion into the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and Web3 applications. You can read about HIVE\u2019s long-term plans here.\n\nUndeterred Optimism Amid The Ongoing Bitcoin Bear Market\n\nMy fellow presenters and attendees were all incredibly bullish on Bitcoin, despite the ongoing bear market that has seen the digital asset retreat from its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nThe conference coincided with Bitcoin crossing a significant milestone: the successful mining of the 800,000th block. This landmark event teases the upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving event, projected to happen when block 840,000 is mined in less than nine months from now. The halving process, which occurs approximately every four years, cuts the rewards for Bitcoin miners in half, thereby limiting new supply and creating scarcity.\n\nHistorically, every new cycle has resulted in a fresh, record-high price for Bitcoin. This phenomenon is attributed to the realization among investors that the asset\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million coins, a factor that could spur the price to visit new highs.\n\nBitcoin In Need Of Regulatory Clarity\n\nMany presenters and panelists at the conference centered their message on the need for regulatory clarity in the mining space. Among the most esteemed speakers was Dennis Porter, co-founder and CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, whose mission is to educate legislators and policymakers across the U.S. on Bitcoin\u2019s varied benefits.\n\nDuring his presentation, Dennis drew interesting parallels between Bitcoin and the cannabis industry, both of which have had to lobby for state-level acceptance and legislation, even as they continue to face federal-level restrictions. He touted his group\u2019s success in getting Montana and Arkansas to pass the Right to Mine law, which protects Bitcoin miners and prohibits energy producers from imposing discriminatory rates on them. The Fund was also instrumental in moving the Texas legislature to kill a proposed anti-mining bill.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also participated at Mining Disrupt via Zoom, representing one of four current candidates who expressly support Bitcoin-friendly policies, the others being entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida governor Ron DeSantis and Miami mayor Francis Suarez, who opts to take his mayoral salary in Bitcoin.\n\nKennedy, who recently disclosed purchasing two bitcoins for each of his seven children, reaffirmed his intention to back the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin and exempt the asset from capital gains taxes if elected president, saying that such exemptions should primarily benefit small investors and businesses.\n\nA Legislative Milestone For Digital Assets?\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, a bipartisan bill that aims to provide a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies was advanced by a key congressional committee last week. This legislation, endorsed by the House Financial Services Committee, was in response to last year\u2019s sudden collapses of several crypto firms, including Celsius and Voyager. It defines a cryptocurrency\u2019s status as either a security or a commodity, expands the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) oversight of the industry and clarifies the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) jurisdiction.\n\nDespite some opposition, the bill received support from committee Republicans and some Democrats, marking a major legislative moment for the digital asset sector.\n\nMake no mistake, the bill has been met with opposition, primarily from Rep. Maxine Waters, the leading Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, who believes the bill would cause confusion and reduce protections for consumers and investors. Similar concerns have been raised in the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nHowever, many in the crypto industry remain optimistic, asserting that with bipartisan support, the bill could stand a chance in the Senate. The debate continues over whether these assets should be treated as securities or commodities, highlighting the need for regulatory clarity in this evolving sector.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs And Their Potential Approval\n\nI also want to highlight the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved in the U.S. At the Mining Disrupt conference, there was guarded optimism that this may happen soon, following repeated rejections in the past. I believe a spot ETF would be a significant catalyst for Bitcoin, potentially streamlining access for both institutional and retail investors and driving up demand and price.\n\nApplications for such an ETF from multiple firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, VanEck and WisdomTree, have been published in the Federal Register, moving them one step further in the SEC\u2019s approval process. The official journal of the U.S. government now has a window to accept, reject, extend or open these applications for public comments.\n\nWith the Bitcoin network inching closer to the next halving event and the simultaneous evolution of the ecosystem and regulatory landscape, the world is keeping a watchful eye on the digital asset\u2019s progress. Here\u2019s to the fascinating journey ahead!\n\nOriginally published by U.S. Global Investors on July 31, 2023.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit VettaFi | ETF Trends.\n\nFrank Holmes has been appointed non-executive chairman of the Board of Directors of HIVE Digital Technologies.
