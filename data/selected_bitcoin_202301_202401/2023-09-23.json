        "content": "Blockchain intelligence platform Arkham recently identified that crypto exchange Coinbase holds almost 1 million Bitcoin (BTC) in its wallets. The coins are worth more than $25 billion at current market prices for BTC.\n\nAccording to Arkham, the exchange\u2019s holdings amount to almost 5% of all existing Bitcoin. Arkham said that Coinbase holds a total of 947,755 BTC. At the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply is around 19,493,537, according to coin information website CoinGecko.\n\nArkham has now identified $25B of Coinbase Bitcoin reserves (~1M BTC) on chain.\n\n\n\nThis makes Coinbase the largest Bitcoin entity in the world on Arkham, with almost 5% of all BTC in existence - about as much as Satoshi Nakamoto. pic.twitter.com/7sDOczS7WT \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) September 22, 2023\n\nFurthermore, Arkham also noted that it tagged and identified 36 million Bitcoin deposit and holding addresses used by the exchange. According to Arkham, Coinbase\u2019s largest cold wallet holds around 10,000 BTC. Based on the exchange\u2019s financial reports, the intelligence company believes that Coinbase has more Bitcoin that are not yet labeled and could not be identified.\n\nWhile Coinbase holds over $25 billion in BTC in its wallets, the exchange only owns around 10,000 of all the Bitcoin it holds, which is worth roughly $200 million, according to recent data.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining can help reduce up to 8% of global emissions: Report\n\nMeanwhile, community members expressed varying reactions to the news about the amount of Bitcoin the centralized exchange holds. Some believe it\u2019s a sign to withdraw their BTC from exchanges, warning holders not to wait until exchanges start to halt withdrawals. Others say that since there are legitimate concerns over cold wallets, there\u2019s no good way to store their assets.\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin ownership by companies, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy still owns the most BTC. In earnings results posted on Aug. 1, the firm\u2019s co-founder Michael Saylor declared that the company owns 152,800 BTC, worth over $4 billion at the time of writing.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "content": "Widely followed pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa says one Dogecoin (DOGE) rival could make a bigger move to the upside.\n\nAltcoin Sherpa tells his 196,400 followers on the social media platform X that after breaking through a key resistance level, memecoin Pepe (PEPE) may not be done rallying.\n\n\u201cPEPE: nice move today, I didn\u2019t really see this one coming. The volume profile shows three significant resistance areas, with the first one getting broken now. I highly doubt this is a full reversal, but a bit more upside may be in store. Would be cautious with this one overall.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the next resistance level appears to be between the price range of $0.00000078 to $0.000000820.\n\nPepe is trading for $0.000000716 at time of writing, up 16.9% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, the trader weighs in on Bitcoin (BTC) and says the market remains unclear as key exponential moving averages (EMAs) converge just above the crypto king\u2019s price, acting as resistance.\n\n\u201cBTC one-day thoughts: overall market structure hasn\u2019t changed much IMO (in my opinion). We\u2019re still either forming some sort of weird higher low OR consolidating for the next leg down. The cluster of one-day EMAs all acting as resistance for now, but no clear change.\u201d\n\nThe trader predicts Bitcoin will decline to finish out the year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t personally have a super strong opinion in regards to where price goes. Gut says we move up to $28,000 in the mid-term, but I don\u2019t really know. The last recent high established in mid-July was an equal high from before and not truly a higher high IMO.\n\nI think we\u2019re still in an overall chop fest similar to 2019, where we saw a big move up and we\u2019ll see a slow grind down for the rest of 2023. Probably slow grind down IMO and then we have some good times in December/January as always.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $26,595 at time of writing, up 0.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says he\u2019s keeping an eye on the AI-based altcoin Worldcoin (WLD). According to Altcoin Sherpa, WLD might be in a position to witness a price dip after a brief rally as it now trades close to a key resistance level.\n\n\u201cWLD: Total shitcoin, but I think that this one makes a lower high. I\u2019m in since $1.42ish.\u201d\n\nWorldcoin is trading for $1.62 at time of writing, up 7.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin miners double down on efficiency and renewable energy at the World Digital Mining Summit - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitmain rolled out its next-generation Antminer S21 and S21 Hydro ASIC miners at the World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) in Hong Kong on Sept. 22, revealing the crucial performance stats the entire industry has been waiting for. The S21 has a hash rate of 200 terahashes per second (TH/s) and an efficiency of 17.5 joules per terahash (J/T), while the S21 hydro hashes at 335 TH/s and 16 J/T, which is notable given that until recently, most Bitcoin ASICS were operating above the 20 J/T level.\n\nWith electricity costs continuing to rise year-over-year and the Bitcoin halving projected to occur in April 2024, ASIC efficiency is quickly becoming the paramount focus of miners, and many are also pivoting toward folding in renewable energy sources as a core component of their operations.\n\nBitcoin miners focus on efficiency and renewable energy\n\nSustainable development in the mining industry was a core theme discussed in a majority of the panels at the WDMS. In the opening roundtable, team members from Terrawulf, Core Scientific, CleanSpark and Iris Energy shared their perspectives on how further integration of renewable energy sources will become a critical strategy to implement for many miners after the April 2024 Bitcoin supply halving.\n\nBitmain World Digital Mining Summit. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccording to Nazar Khan, Terrawulf\u2019s chief operating officer:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a significant transition going on in the supply side of the generation process; there\u2019s a concerted effort to decarbonize the entire supply stack, and so when we talk about Bitcoin miners consuming more renewable energy, that\u2019s part of a broader theme that\u2019s happening across the United States without Bitcoin mining as well. The role that we play is locating our Bitcoin mining loads in places where that\u2019s happening and how do we facilitate that decarbonization process.\u201c\n\nOne impact of the upcoming supply halving is that miners will maintain the same capital and operational costs, plus the need to pay down any revolving debts, while essentially seeing their block reward distribution cut in half.\n\nFor this reason, miners will either need to increase the percentage of their hash rate derived from sustainable energy sources or make efficiency adjustments to their ASIC fleet to maintain or increase their profitability.\n\nRegarding the rollout of the Antminer S21 and its potential impact on the mining industry, BMC founder Justin Kramer said:\n\n\u201cThe S21, if reliable, fairly priced and readily available \u2014 and yes, that\u2019s a lot of ifs with Bitmain\u2019s history \u2014 could revolutionize the crypto mining landscape with its efficiency. It is basically packing the power of two S19 100T miners into one unit. Despite this, the burgeoning aftermarket firmware market, coupled with hydro/immersion systems, give miners more tools to keep older generation miners, such as the S19, profitable also. Thus, while the S21 represents a notable advancement, it may not render sub 110 TH/s miners entirely obsolete.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about what else caught this eye from the S21 release, Kramer noted that:\n\n\u201cI like that Bitmain is rewarding environmentally friendly mining farms with better pricing and advanced delivery with their new Carbon Neutral Certificate. But, I\u2019ll add that, it was a little surprising when I noticed that both new S21 models offer 33% more hash rate (S21 200T versus 151T on S19j XP; S21 hydro is 335T versus the S19 XP Hydro at 257T). Is this a coincidence? I\u2019m doubtful, and it likely signals more of the same systematic model releases from Bitmain where a slight tweak to the firmware and maybe a few other items that are adjusted results in a moderate increase in hash rate and a brand-new miner.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is en route to becoming an ESG asset\n\nA theme of the past few years has been an increase in Bitcoin miners and BTC advocates pushing back against the assertion that Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment, and that the industry\u2019s reliance on carbon-based energy production accelerates emissions.\n\nCountering this perspective, Hong Kong Sustaintech Foundation professor in accounting and finance, Haitian Lu, bluntly announced that:\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is promoting renewable energy adoption in many areas.\u201d\n\nLu explained that \u201cover the years, Bitcoin mining has become more efficient and is also using cleaner energy. History tells us that human development from an agricultural society to industrialization to the future of a digitalized economy goes with every increasing energy consumption per capita. What makes the difference is human\u2019s ability to use renewable energy increases, thus achieving sustainable development.\u201d\n\nLike the perspectives shared by other panelists, Lu said that Bitcoin miners\u2019 participation in demand response agreements with power producers and distributors leads to energy grid efficiency, and they \u201cprovide an economic incentive for the development of renewable energy \u201cpromotion and development of renewable energy projects.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin mining tapping into stranded energy, encouraging the development of renewable energy projects and helping to balance electric grids, the efficiency advancements of next-generation ASICs like the Antminer S21 reduce miners\u2019 energy consumption while also allowing them to boost their profits."
