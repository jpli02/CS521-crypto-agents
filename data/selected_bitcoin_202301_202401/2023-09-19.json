        "title": "Nomura's Laser launches institutional Bitcoin fund - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Today Nomura\u2019s digital assets subsidiary Laser Digital unveiled its Bitcoin Adoption Fund targeting institutional investors. It\u2019s a Cayman Islands long-only mutual fund with the digital asset custody secured by Komainu.\n\nNomura cofounded Komainu as a regulated custodian in 2018 alongside tech security firm Ledger and asset manager Coinshares.\n\n\u201cTechnology is a key driver of global economic growth and is transforming a large part of the economy from analogue to digital,\u201d said Sebastien Guglietta, Head of Laser Digital Asset Management. \u201cBitcoin is one of the enablers of this long-lasting transformational change.\u201d\n\nGuglietta who leads the fund, was formerly Chief Scientist at Nomura. Before that he held the same role at Brevan Howard as well as portfolio manager.\n\nAsset management is the second part of Laser Digital\u2019s strategy. It launched with a venture capital fund, which has invested across web3, especially DeFi. The third arm will be digital asset trading. It\u2019s no coincidence that it bought elysium, a post trade solution for FX and digital assets.\n\nInstitutional Bitcoin funds\n\nThe crypto community is eagerly awaiting the first U.S. authorization of a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF). While that might encourage consumer adoption in the U.S., exchange traded products have already been available elsewhere. One example is the Coinshares Physical Crypto ETP.\n\nHowever, institutions have also been able to get exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding crypto. Several large banks, including Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan partnered with crypto specialist asset managers NYDIG and Galaxy Digital. NYDIG has several funds with more than $750 million (January) in assets under management just in its NYDIG Institutional Bitcoin Fund. Last year BlackRock launched a Bitcoin investment trust.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the notorious Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which reached a discount to net asset value price of almost 50% at the start of the year. Although it recently recovered to a deficit of \u201cjust\u201d 20% after winning an SEC lawsuit."

        "content": "There may be over 10 financial giants filing to launch a Bitcoin ETF, but according to one analyst, BlackRock's application may be the one to watch.\n\nIn a CNBC video released Monday, Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman called BlackRock's filing \"much more important\" than the other prospective offerings. To date, other applicants include Fidelity, Digital Currency Group, and most recently Franklin Templeton, which joined the race just last week.\n\n\"If Blackrock has an ETF, you know that they are going to win. They have the marketing and distribution to put new people into Bitcoin,\" Dorman said.\n\nAccording to the CNBC, BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management firms, has been closely monitoring the cryptocurrency market for some time, even quietly exploring ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its investment strategies.\n\nThis prospective move by BlackRock could signal a major vote of confidence in the cryptocurrency and might encourage other institutional investors to follow suit.\n\nElsewhere in the video, experts shed light on how a spot Bitcoin ETF could provide traditional investors with a regulated and accessible gateway into the cryptocurrency market. Experts believe that once the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF, it will likely attract a broad spectrum of investors, from retail traders to institutional players, who have been waiting for a regulated vehicle to enter the crypto space.\n\nAlready, Bitcoin Futures ETFs are publicly traded, though these funds notably do not buy or sell Bitcoin on the open market.\n\nFinally, the experts noted Bitcoin's broader narrative as a decentralized digital currency and store of value, as well as how the upcoming halving, in which the rewards Bitcoin pays out to the miners that secure the protocol will be reduced, could put a positive pressure on its price dynamics.\n\nTaken together, the CNBC report was confident enough to declare a \"next bull market\" may soon be in store.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "What Happens After A Spot Bitcoin ETF is Approved? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "One of the latest developments in the Bitcoin market is the potential approval of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). An ETF is a financial product that allows investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. In the case of a Bitcoin ETF, it would provide investors with a convenient way to invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. But what would happen if a Bitcoin ETF is approved? Let's dive into the potential implications and outcomes.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe Basics of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would function similarly to other ETFs, in that it would be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and subject to strict reporting requirements. This would provide investors with a level of transparency and oversight that is often lacking in the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, a Bitcoin ETF would bring institutional-grade custody solutions, reducing the risk of theft or loss of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Role of ETFs in the Financial Market\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF would likely lead to increased market liquidity. As more investors enter the market through the ETF, the overall trading volume of Bitcoin would likely increase. This increased liquidity could help stabilize the price of Bitcoin and reduce volatility, making it a more attractive investment option for both retail and institutional investors.\n\nAdditionally, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could have positive implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. It would signal a greater acceptance and recognition of Bitcoin by regulatory authorities, potentially leading to increased adoption and mainstream integration of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Regulatory Hurdles\n\nRegulators have expressed concerns about the potential for market manipulation, lack of investor protection, and the possibility of fraud in the Bitcoin market. These concerns have led the SEC to reject multiple Bitcoin ETF proposals in the past.\n\nHowever, proponents of a Bitcoin ETF argue that the market has matured significantly since those rejections. They highlight the introduction of regulated exchanges, increased transparency, and the growing interest from institutional investors as signs of a more robust and regulated ecosystem.\n\nThe Current Status of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nAs of now, the SEC has not approved any Bitcoin ETFs. However, several companies have filed proposals, with some making significant progress towards approval. The industry eagerly awaits a decision from the SEC, which could have far-reaching consequences for the Bitcoin market.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF holds significant implications for the Bitcoin market and the broader financial industry. It would provide investors with a regulated and convenient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially driving increased demand and liquidity. Additionally, it could attract institutional investors, bringing stability and validation to the market. However, risks and challenges, such as market volatility and regulatory uncertainties, must be carefully considered. Only time will tell how the journey towards Bitcoin ETF approval unfolds, but the potential outcomes warrant close attention from investors and regulators alike.\n\nBitcoin Backstage with Dylan LeClair\n\nDylan\u2019s advice in a bear market\n\n\u201cJust understand what you own. You cannot borrow someone else\u2019s conviction. You need to understand what bitcoin is, where it is potentially going, think of the long term game, and stay humble and stack sats.\u201d\n\nDylan\u2019s advice to newcomers\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of work to understand what bitcoin is, but ultimately bitcoin is a savings mechanism that no one can mess with if you safely self custody your bitcoin.\u201d\n\nDylan left us off with \u201cBitcoin fixes the government monopoly on money and currency debasement.\u201d\n\nQuick Bitcoin News Recap of the Week\n\nPaxos Fat Fingered Bitcoin\n\nWhile at first it looked like PayPal overpaid by over a whopping half a million dollars, or about 19 bitcoin worth of transaction fees with on-chains analytics, it was actually Paxos that caused the error.\n\nCoinbase Integrates Lightning\n\nCoinbase announces plans to integrate the Lightning Network onto their exchange platform. CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted out saying that Bitcoin is the most important asset in cryptocurrency.\n\nCEO of Binance US Leaves Company\n\nBrian Shroder, the CEO of Binance.US, leaves the company, news that preceded 33% of the Binance workforce being laid off.
